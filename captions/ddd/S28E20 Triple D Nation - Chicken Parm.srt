         larger kitchen,        

117
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:18,256
     which allows us to make    
         a larger menu.         

118
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:22,594
 Look at this.                  
     One of our best sellers    
  is the ahi poke crunch wrap.  

119
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:23,795
      You know, raw tuna --     

120
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,998
     It's like a good piece     
         is like butter.        

121
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,468
   A little bit of chili paste  
 and a little bit of sesame oil,

122
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,403
         and it's a real        
        simple marinade.        

123
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:37,608
 Put rice in there, mixed greens
  with a tostada, wasabi mayo.  

124
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,676
       And I'm gonna fold.      

125
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:41,546
       We're gonna put it       
         on the griddle.        

126
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:43,548
        This is your ahi        
        poke crunch wrap.

128
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,223
This is everything you love     
 about a poke bowl,             

129
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:53,091
   but easy to eat              
   in a tortilla.               

130
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,293
I mean, this is awesome.        

131
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:56,094
      The poke crunch wrap      
     is one of my favorites.    

132
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:58,830
       You have the sweet,      
     the spice, the crunch.     

133
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,765
      And it's just a taste     
    explosion in your mouth.

             One shrimp and fry.

135
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:04,569
This is what I think tripped    
people out when they saw        

136
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:06,971
BIG & little's the first time   
   back in 2011 --              

137
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,573
is they see two guys            
   that look like               

138
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:10,776
they like chicken wings,        
   burgers, fries.              

139

                        We do.  
             We do.             

140
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:16,514
We do, but you take it          
 to the next level.             

141
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,717
FIERI: Like with this bad boy --
        the Zeus burger.        

142
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,451
 That's a fried egg, beef patty,

143
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:23,521
     and gyro meat all piled    
     inside a hamburger bun.    

144
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:26,457
   And they're rocking a spicy  
      beef short rib taco.      

145
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,927
 D'ALESSANDRO: We shred it, and 
 then we sear it on the griddle 

146
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,728
          and serve it          
  with a sweet chili Thai sauce 

147
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,130
         and some onions        
          and cilantro.         

148
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:34,866
 So, coming from...             

149
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:36,801
     a guy that                 
eats a lot of tacos --          

150
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:39,938
  texture's great,              
glad you didn't junk it up      

151
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,006
with a bunch of stuff...        
             Right.             

152
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,473
 ...a little onion,             
 a little cilantro,             

153
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,409
good tang, can't beat it.       

154
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:45,877
        It's got a little       
        sweet side to it,       

155
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,746
       but it's also that       
        little spicy kick       

156
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:49,414
       that really brings       
        it all together.        

157
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,349
   MAN: Perfectly cooked meat,  
    and it's the same flavor    

158
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,617
      all the way through,      
     which I love about it.     

159
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:53,885
      It's the consistency.     

160
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,554
     FIERI: Now these guy's     
       got four locations.      

161
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:57,422
 This is taking the opportunity 
      and running with it.      

162
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:58,556
  Well, you're godfathers now.  

163
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,792
          You're made.          

164
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:05,296
   But if you're talking about  
     a culinary godmother...    

165
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:06,497
         That's killer.         

166
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,233
      ...she's served me up     
    one of my favorite tastes   

167
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:10,836
     of Trinidad in Seattle,    
        of all places...        

168
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:12,036
        We're gonna make        
       some Paratha roti.       

169
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,438
        Write that down.        

170
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,440
    ...and "Triple D Nation"    
          took notice.          

171
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:18,343
     We had a line that went    
  all the way around the block. 

172
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:26,083
    So, back in '09, I was in   
 Seattle's University District, 

173
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:27,418
       and I was going to       
        check out a joint       

174
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,222
       that was known for       
  this knockout Trinidad food.  

175
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:32,757
  Now, as soon as I tasted it,  
           I told Pam,          

176
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,493
  "Listen, you got to get ready 
    for a line out the door,"   

177
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:36,762
          and she did.          

178
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:39,764
      It's a new location,      
 but the food is still rocking. 

179
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,566
     This is Pam's Kitchen.

      Jerk chicken dinner.      

183
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:50,509
 Trinidad food is a combination 
      of creole and Indian.

        Just very tasty.

192
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,257
Okay, we have a goat head salad.

193
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,260
    So, Pam Jacob -- I mean,    
  she started as a housekeeper  

194
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,596
        with 1,500 bucks

      Don't you even worry      
        about this, Pam.        

197
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:19,003
   I mean, she puts her heart   
   into everything she makes.   

198
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,538
So, we're making buttery,       
    flaky bread?                

199
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,474
                       Yeah.    
   It's called...               

200
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:23,808
 parley the rotary?

00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,746
        We're gonna make        
       some Paratha roti.       

203
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:28,947
        Write that down.        

204
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,816
          In Trinidad, it's also
        called the buss up shut.

205
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,685
Oh, gosh, don't start.          

206
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:36,755
       He threw in a little joke
                 in between.    

207
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:38,490
   Could be risky.              

208
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:40,492
        I love that guy.        

209
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:42,093
   We're gonna do               
    the Dahlpuri.               

210
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:44,996
         So, we start --        
     I use 7 cups of flour.     

211
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:47,765
      Uh, Pam,                  
  that's not a cup.             

212
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,834
               Seven of this,   

213
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,170
              but it's 4 cups.  
                    Yeah.       

214
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:53,972
          Her method's          
    a little unconventional,    

215
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,174
     a little strange to me.    

216
00:07:56,176 --> 00:08:00,779
    I think he takes the food   
          really well.          

217
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:04,649
    He was rolling the roti,    
    and it was like perfect.    

218
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,384
  Oh, my goodness.              

219
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:09,621
  This is amazing.              

220
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:10,855
        Get that on tape.       

221
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:12,524
       We're gonna start beating
                 that roti.     

222
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,395
      JACOB: Guy never had      
    Trinidadian food before.

00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:18,596
            All for you at home.

00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:21,065
      I'm just suffering through
               this right now.  

225
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:24,202
           Let me feel the pain.
               That's killer.   

226
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:26,804
        I feel very happy       
   that he tasted mine first.   

227
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,673
     We're gonna make pelau.    

228
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,174
          Some salt...          
                   Black pepper.

229
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,943
      ...a little habanero,     
           of course.           

230
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:35,947
    One of my customers would   
 describe my pelau as jambalaya,

231
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:39,484
  but I've never had jambalaya, 
     so I used that on him.     

232
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:42,821
In New Orleans, there's a mix up
with all the rices and all that.

233
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,155
  Jambalaya.                    
             Right.             

234
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:47,626
    This is similar to it but   
  with a whole lot more flavor. 

235
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:48,727
         I never had it.        

236
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,031
          Mmm. The rice         
       is nice and tender,      

237
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,866
   the chicken thigh is moist.  

238
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,235
              Mmm.              
       That was delicious.      

239
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:58,970
    Every thing I've had here   
       has been delicious.      

240
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:01,239
      Crazy, but delicious.     

241
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:02,974
       Crazy.                   
  I like that one.              

242
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:07,512
   Before he leave, he give me  
  the biggest hug, and he said, 

243
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:09,847
        "Not tomorrow..."       

244
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:14,119
    [Voice breaking] He said,   
    "Not tomorrow -- today --   

245
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:15,587
  you should extend this place  

246
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:19,324
             because            
   you're gonna have a line."   

247
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:20,592
           And I did.           

248
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:22,660
        We had a line --        

249
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:27,432
     We had a line that went    
  all the way around the block. 

250
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:29,934
  FIERI: So, she picked up and  
    moved to a bigger place,    

251
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,936
   plus added a few new things  
           to her menu          

252
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:35,607
  like her Trinidadian take on  
    Jamaican jerk pork ribs.    

253
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:39,544
   So, we start with ketchup,   
    soy sauce, barbecue sauce   

254
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:41,746
    for the smokiness, sugar.   

255
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,682
  FIERI: But it's the habaneros 
       that she throws in       

256
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:45,617
      that really kicks up      
        the spice factor.       

257
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:48,153
   JACOB: So, I'm making sure   
     it's really well-coated    

258
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:50,622
          and gives it          
      that spicy goodness.      

259
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:55,927
      So, this is now ready     
 for temperature 145 for 1 hour.

260
00:09:58,165 --> 00:09:59,964
      The pork spare ribs.      

261
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,033
   It starts off with a nice,   
          sweet flavor,         

262
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,168
       and then the spice       
    comes in towards the end.   

263
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,904
      It's super flavorful      
        and cooked great.       

264
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:09,641
   Really spiced and seasoned.  
            Love it.            

265
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:10,976
             JACOB:             
      I wanted to do lunch,     

266
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:14,379
     and I didn't want to do    
the same thing we do for dinner.

267
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:18,516
      That's how I came up      
  with deep-fried coconut bake. 

268
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:21,186
    That's a traditional word   
         from Trinidad.         

269
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:24,455
        We fry our dough        
      and we call it bake.      

270
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:28,259
  It's infused with the coconut 
  milk and the coconut flakes.  

271
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:30,195
    Makes it feel like you're   
        in the Caribbean.       

272
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:35,399
    Salad, a little dressing,   
  and then we put the pork in.  

273
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:39,937
    This is my Geera pork --    
   the coconut bake sandwich.   

274
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:43,541
 Coconut bread is heavenly food.
    It's soft on the inside,    

275
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:45,343
       just kind of wants       
     to melt in your mouth.     

276
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:46,811
              MAN:              
     It's got a crisp to it,    

277
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,480
      but it's still spongy     
   and absorbs all the flavor.  

278
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,482
     It is just an excellent    
           complement.          

279
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,152
       JACOB: I get people      
      from Europe, England.     

280
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,553
    The world knows about me.   

281
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:58,490
  If I lived here in this area, 
    I'd be here once a week.    

282
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,224
I mean, it's simple, it's basic,

283
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:02,427
     it's got great flavor,     
       there's good depth,      

284
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:03,828
   I think it's a good value.   

285
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:09,367
  It's the most beautiful gift  
that I could have ever received.

286
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:10,835
                You're great.   

287
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,772
         You are one great cook.

288
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:15,773
       I got to tell you,       
      I am so proud of Pam      

289
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:18,109
       in taking her joint      
       to the next level.       

290
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:20,778
   Now, talking about going to  
         the next level,        

291
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,913
    let's talk about a joint    
        north of Chicago.       

292
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,183
         I give this place a 10.

293
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,919
 When I got there, I didn't know
       if it was a diner,       

294
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:29,654
     a drive-in, or a dive.     

295
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:31,256
  Let's just call it a shanty,  
            alright?            

296
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:32,123
          You tell me.          

297
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,463
        So, back in 2010,       

298
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:42,467
        we're on Route 41       
 between Chicago and Milwaukee. 

299
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:43,668
   I didn't know what to call   
           this place.          

300
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,002
     Nah, maybe we wouldn't     
        call it a joint.        

301
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:47,004
         Call it a dive.        
 Nah, I wouldn't call it a dive.

302
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,072
 Well, that doesn't even matter 

303
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,540
        because the story       
        got even bigger.        

304
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,076
 You see, one of our researchers
         for "Triple D"         

305
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,745
        ended up marrying       
       one of the owners.       

306
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:56,013
       This is The Shanty.      

307
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:59,283
                     ♪♪         

308
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,152
Whiskey shrimp, table 4.        

309
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:04,622
     After I saw The Shanty     
 on "Triple D", I made the trek,

310
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:07,224
    and I've been coming here   
           ever since.          

311
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,693
  You can get any kind of dish  
            you want.           

312
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:12,163
  I've got a shrimp             
 and scallops sauté.            
                     Thank you. 

313
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:15,833
   It's a family-run business,  
 and it's a great place to eat. 

314
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,368
  FIERI: It may be family-run,  

315
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,238
   but when I first got there,  
     owner Dimitri Kallianis    

316
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,440
          made it clear         
    who was really in charge.   

317
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:24,776
So you built a whole menu       
     off of what                

318
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:26,177
your customers wanted.          
                      Yeah.     

319
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,179
  Did you let them              
set the pricing, too?           

320
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:29,380
               Yeah, in a way,  
                   we did.      
       Really?                  

321
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:30,381
       'Cause when we raised it,
                they yelled,    

322
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,517
           so then we brought it
                 back down.     

323
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,185
               Alligator tail,  
                  table 14.     

324
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:36,453
   Now, some of the hot ticket  
      items were crab cakes     

325
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:39,256
          and walleye,          
  but I dove into this bad boy. 

326
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,658
          Whiskey shrimp dinner.

327
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,260
           We're gonna start off
   with some sweet cream butter,

328
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,596
           two pitchers of heavy
               whipping cream.  

329
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,531
In case everybody at home       
measures by pitcher.            

330
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,334
                Three squirts   
             of yellow mustard. 

331
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:50,335
Pitchers and squirts.           

332
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:53,604
        This is jumbo white gulf
             shrimp from Texas. 

333
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,740
               We're gonna add  
                some whiskey.   

334
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:56,941
                This is gonna   
             flare pretty good. 

335
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,110
             I like to call this
              Greek Lightning.  

336
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,480
              -Ooh.             
         -Whiskey sauce,        

337
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:04,882
   fresh tarragon,              
  and there you go.             

338
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,350
             That's some sauce. 

339
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:07,685
               God, the shrimp  
                 are killer.    

340
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:09,821
     There's nothing that shrimp
                 like better    

341
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:12,656
          than garlic and butter
             and some tarragon. 

342
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:14,292
                    Whoo.       
               Good job, man.   

343
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,360
     Thank you.                 

344
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:17,828
    Can we have a short rib?    

345
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,230
   Guy did an unbelievable job  

346
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:20,764
      of really coaching me     
         in the kitchen,        

347
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:22,901
        explaining to me        
        what was coming,        

348
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:24,235
        making sure we're       
       getting more staff,      

349
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:26,170
       more kitchen staff,      
          more parking.         

350
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:27,639
             FIERI:             
       And did they ever.       

351
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:28,706
    They quadrupled the size    

352
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,309
   of their 2,000 square foot   
        roadside shanty.        

353
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,043
     This place is enormous.    

354
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:34,312
    KALLIANIS: After "Diners,   
       Drive-Ins & Dives",      

355
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,914
     the whole place blew up    
           with people          

356
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,848
         coming from all        
        over the country,       

357
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,718
        so had to expand        
         our restaurant.        

358
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,923
     We added a dining room,    
      a 100-seat bar area,      

359
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:47,325
        outside seating,        
        wine cellar room.       

360
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,927
     I mean, really creating    
    this culinary experience.   

361
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,063
   4 -- muscles, lemon, wine.   

362
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:54,665
   In 11 years, we've changed   
       our menu 13 times,       

363
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,402
constantly reinventing ourselves
       and pushing the bar      

364
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:58,802
       as high as we can.       

365
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:00,738
  Our apple brandy braised pork 
        shanks are served       

366
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,407
  as an appetizer or a dinner.  

367
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:05,276
   We created an apple brandy   
        cranberry sauce.        

368
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:07,812
   It has a very sweet flavor,  
       very tangy flavor.       

369
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:10,481
      The sweet comes from      
   brandy-soaked cranberries,   

370
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:12,683
      the tangy comes from      
  the aged balsamic reduction,  

371
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,418
  and the apple cider vinegar.  

372
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,487
         We add those to        
     the natural pork shank,    

373
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,422
         we braise them         
       very slow and low.       

374
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,692
    From there, we take them    
       and pan sear them,       

375
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,694
      then we add our sauce     
       back into the dish,      

376
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,629
        reducing it with        
       some aged balsamic.      

377
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:25,896
    The meat is very tender.    

378
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:27,164
    It'll fall off the bone.    

379
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,034
It is just a perfect combination
      of savory and sweet.      

380
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,836
     Hi, there.                 
We've got a goat cheese wanton. 

381
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:33,637
            Thank you very much.

382
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,908
             FIERI:             
  They're also dishing out goat 
cheese and basil stuffed wantons

383
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,510
 topped with Dimitri's signature
        sweet chili sauce       

384
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:41,713
  infused with pineapple juice. 

385
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,648
    Then they're served with    
        this wasabi cream       

386
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,182
     to really pack a punch.    

387
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:46,584
   WOMAN: I love that it's got  
        the crispy shell.       

388
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:48,719
     They've got the really     
        sweet pink sauce        

389
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,254
 combined with the spicy wasabi,

390
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,856
    so it's kind of a perfect   
     combination of flavors.    

391
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:55,126
    FIERI: So, going back to    
   The Shanty was really cool.  

392
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:56,994
       I wanted to see how      
    the restaurant had grown.   

393
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,663
       I wanted to see how      
     the family had changed.    

394
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:02,866
 But I got to tell you, this is 
   way more than I'd expected.  

395
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,335
       We got a call from       
         Food Network's         

396
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:07,304
  "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives",  
    from a research producer.   

397
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:10,608
I was vetting restaurants       
between Milwaukee and Chicago.  

398
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,609
       We just hit it off,      
      she seemed very nice,     

399
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:14,679
         and from there,        
      we just kept talking.     

400
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:17,147
  We ended up getting married,  
  and we have two children now. 

401
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:20,551
Looking back, I still           
can't believe how life          

402
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:22,687
has it's way of bringing        
two people together,            

403
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:27,858
and I am so grateful to "Diners"
for this awesome Greek family.  

404
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,493
              Wow.              

405
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:30,828
    Days of my Greek family.    

406
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,597
         That's gonna be        
        a new soap opera.       

407
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:37,635
   So, was it a diner, was it   
  a drive-in, or was it a dive? 

408
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:39,036
    Or was it even a shanty?    

409
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,372
      To me, it looks like      
          a palace now.         

410
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:43,574
  Alright, coming up in Denver, 

411
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:46,310
       a joint with a true      
        identity crisis.        

412
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:49,180
 You have got to make some sense
    of what's going on here.    

413
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:55,787
        So, back in 2013,       
    I'm in Denver, Colorado.    

414
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,523
  I go to this joint that's got 
   a complete identity crisis.  

415
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:00,458
         It's a dive bar        
       with a pizza joint       

416
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,760
       and a biscuit place      
       all under one roof.      

417
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,862
          Sounds crazy,         
   but it was actually genius.  

418
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:07,131
    And now they've got four    
 locations throughout the state.

419
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:10,335
         This is the one        
     and only Atomic Cowboy.    

420
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:13,204
        Alright, table 4,       
       an Elmer, DBC Club.      

421
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:15,940
We saw this place on "Triple D",
 and we couldn't wait to try it.

422
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:18,142
    WOMAN: The Denver Biscuit   
      Company, Fat Sully's,     

423
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:22,013
      and this whole group      
 of restaurants here is amazing.

424
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,614
          -The slices!          
             -Whoo!             
             -Whoo.             

425
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,416
             -Yeah.             
         -Look at this.         
    -Something for everybody.   

426
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:30,021
 FIERI: So, when I first walked 
  into this joint, right away,  

427
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:33,024
        owner Drew Shader       
   had some explaining to do.   

428
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:36,760
 You have got to make some sense
    of what's going on here.    

429
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:39,696
        You've got a bar,       
 a pizza joint, a biscuit joint,

430
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:40,898
  and you have two food trucks. 

431
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,166
       SHADER:                  
Out of the same building.       

432
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,967
      I've seen some crazy stuff
             across the country.

433
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:46,303
              That might just   
               take the cake.   
   It is crazy.                 

434
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,106
   SHADER: Whoever was talking  
    to me for the three weeks   

435
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:49,640
   leading up to "Triple D's"   
             coming             

436
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,442
     was just talking about     
     Denver Biscuit Company.    

437
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:53,511
  And I was like, "Yeah, Denver 
   Biscuit Company's amazing,   

438
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:56,246
     but the real story here    
is that we have three businesses

439
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:58,116
   operating under one roof."   

440
00:16:58,118 --> 00:17:00,018
    FIERI: We went in just to   
     check out the biscuits.    

441
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,319
 Whilst I'm trying the biscuits,

442
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:03,121
      I look over and I see     
        this pizza joint.       

443
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:04,722
       I'm like, "I got to      
        try some pizza."        

444
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:05,923
                So, what size   
             pizzas do we make? 

445
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:08,393
   We do a 26-inch              
     for slices.                

446

                [ Whistles ]    

447
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,395
              That's a big pie. 

448
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,597
       Yeah.                    
          It's like a bed sheet.

449
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,199
        Look.

451
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:18,202
             So, people come in 
              and get a slice,  

452
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,470
               they can get it  
           any way they want it?

453
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:20,738
 Any way they want.             

454
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,606
     How much cheese is gonna go
           on a pizza this size?

455
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,075
    About 1 pound               
    and 4 ounces.

   weigh it down.
