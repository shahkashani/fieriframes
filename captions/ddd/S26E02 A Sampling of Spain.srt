       A little freaky at first,

     none of this was here.

30
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,330

     So this wasn't a real area?

40
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:34,960
You're right. It was an --      
a fisherman neighborhood.       

41
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:36,895
          No beach, they brought

         What are we gonna make?

56
00:01:58,185 --> 00:01:59,451
The base for our paella.        

57
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:00,318
                 Here we go.    

58
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,920
 We put some oil...             
                       Oil.     

59
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:05,990
Garlic, onions, green pepper,   
  and red peppers.              

60
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:06,959
   A few minutes.               

61
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:08,193
              This is calamari. 

62
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:09,061
     Cuttlefish.                

63
00:02:09,063 --> 00:02:10,462
                 Cuttlefish?    
     Yes.                       

64
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:13,131
I think cuttlefish is more tasty
   than calamari.               

65
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,599
          Okay. Great. Tomatoes?

white pepper, paprika.

Smoked, red pepper paste.

      Bay leaf.                 

70
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,407
               And how long is  
             this going to cook?

71
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:23,675
40 minutes to an hour.          

72
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:25,410
          40 minutes to an hour,
                    okay.       

73
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:26,544
        Yes.                    

74
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,080
   Okay. So we got fresh chicken
                 and rabbit.    

75
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:30,148
               I love rabbit.

it is close to here.            

81
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:39,691
          Is rabbit very popular
             in Spanish cooking?

82
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:40,692
       It is.                   

83
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:42,361
                 Super lean.    
              Salt and pepper.  

84

00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:46,365

89
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,301

And it goes to the oven.        

113
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:28,106
       For another 7, 8 minutes?
