 Yes, yes, yes.

11
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:24,023
              It's a Filipino-

    Shrimp cooked perfectly.

  You go to Spain,

70
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,345
           Like paella, but with
          pasta instead of rice.

71
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:28,813
          We take the angel hair
     pasta, roast it in the oven

72
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,616
                for about 20,   
             30 minutes at 400, 

73
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:32,351
             and cook the pasta 
             till it's al dente.

74
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:33,285
    We're on to?                

75
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:34,686
              We're gonna make  
                the piperade.   

76
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,154
              Put a little oil  
                 in the pan.    

77
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,689
            And then we cook our
            peppers a bit first.

78
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,691
       Add a little salt to help
    the peppers sweat the water.

79
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:41,226
     Gonna start                
that caramelization faster      

80
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:42,561
    and building                
  layers of flavor.             

81
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:44,429
               Yellow onions,   
               sliced garlic.   

82
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:46,364
   And why sliced               
   versus minced?               

83
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,100
          We're cooking this for
          a good amount of time,

84
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:50,035
            and the minced seems
          to get a little burnt.

85
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:52,437
The longer the cooking          
process, the larger the garlic. 

86
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,172
          -You got it.          
      -Come on now, up top.     

87
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,440
                 All right.     

88
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,242
            Piquillo peppers and
           the roasted poblanos.

89
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:58,576
               Sherry vinegar.  

90
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,179
 Most underutilized             
  vinegar there is.             

91
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:01,847
              Red chili flake,  
                  paprika.      

92
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,181
            -Smoked?            
             -It is.            

93
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,716
         A little bit more salt,
                   pepper,      

94
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:06,317
            and then we just let
             this cook together 

95
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,786
       for another minute or two
          to wake up the spices.

96
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:10,522
 Okay, and the final            
step of this will be?           

97
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,124
      You get the fideos rocking
                 in the oil.    

98
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:13,859
 I thought the song             
was "Rock Me Amadeus."          

99
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:16,128
          "Rock Me --"          
     It's "Rock Me Fideos."     

100
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,462
  Never knew that.              

101
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:20,331
              So, we sauté some 
        shallots, minced garlic,

102
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,602
    pinch of salt, our piperade,
       the head-on prawns cooked

103
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:24,836
      for about a minute...     
            Love it.            

104
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:26,671
              ...on each side.  
               Add the pasta.   

105
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:27,806
Lot going on right now.         

106
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,341
           We've got our saffron
              vegetable stock,  

107
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:30,542
            and you can probably
                  smell it.     

108
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:31,542
        It's just delish.       
       -Oh, it's gorgeous.      

109
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,345
                   Cream,       
          we'll add our mussels.

110
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:34,546
   Let those open.              

111
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:35,948
             Little bit of lemon
               juice, parsley,  

112
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,215
            and then she's ready
               for prime time.  

113
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,883
               We're gonna go   
             into our fancy pot,
