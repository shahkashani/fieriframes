00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:29,107
  Kind of a good Southern dish  
       that I really like.      

232
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:31,176
      This is the pimento cheese
   for our pimento cheeseburger.

233
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,044
 Great.                         
              We've got cheddar 
              and Pepper Jack.  

234
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,513
     -It's not local cheese.    
             -Wha?!             

235
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:35,846
          We're waiting for that

236
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,315
              cheddar producer  
         to come along knocking.

237
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,717
We're looking for cheddar!      

238
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,254
       Cream cheese, garlic mayo
              we make in house. 

239
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:44,389
           -I like it.          
   -Fire-roasted bell peppers,  

240
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:46,858
                  sriracha,     
    smoke-dried Marconi peppers,

241
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,860
 sambal, fresh-chopped parsley. 
             -Okay.             

242
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,529
         So, we're just going to
             get things started,

243
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:53,398
      watching to see that cream
  cheese get fully incorporated.

244
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,866
            That's looking good.

245
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,400
There's just that little kick   
  of that sriracha,             

246
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:58,002
    a little kick               
   of that sambal,              

247
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,271
a little of that smokiness      
of that pepper coming through.  

248
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,940
        Now we're going to grind
        the meat for the burger.

249
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:03,942
    We get a whole cow at a time
              from a farm at -- 

250
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:06,945
There is no way you can get     
a whole cow through --          

251
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:08,279
      -Oh, you cube it up.      
             -Yeah.             

252
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,614
     -That makes more sense.    
        -It's a process.        

253
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:11,282
 Okay, so you bring             
   a whole cow in.              

254
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,151
  It's impressive.              
Never seen that before.         

255
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:16,153
         Today we've got sirloin
   and some fattier trim pieces.

256
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:18,557
To make sure that you get the   
fat and the flavor combination. 

257
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,157
        Do course the first time
                  through.      

258
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,226
     Now we're going to sprinkle
         smoked Marconi peppers,

259
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,228
      then we're going to put it
   through for the second grind.

260
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,697
      When we originally opened,
        we thought we were going

261
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,432
         to grind beef to order.

262
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:30,368
"Two burgers? Hold on.          
  Get the grinder!              

263
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,703
 Yeah, we got this!"            

264
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:32,971
   Now we're going              
   to patty it up?              

265
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:35,240
            Make sure it's even,
               pull that ring,  

266
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:36,641
             handle it as little
                as possible.    

267
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:38,176
     It got it.                 
 Onto the flat top.             

268
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:39,978
       We got our sweet potatoes
                  going in.     

269
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,980
And the burger to flip?         

270
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:44,315
               Pimento cheese,  
             and it's game time.

271
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,117
             So, here we've got 
          our savory butter bun.

272
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,385
 Savory butter bun.             

273
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:48,586
          Our house garlic mayo.

274
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,854
  Everything comes              
  with a big salad?             

275
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:51,856
                That's right.   
     You know, the yin and yang.

276
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:54,191
    This is a traditional 14-day
                sweet pickle    

277
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:55,727
              that we make here 
                  in house.     

278
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:57,996
       Slide the burger on here.

279
00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:59,797
 -House-made garlic vinaigrette.
             -Okay.             

280
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,666
              We got our sweet  
             potato fries ready.

281
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,267
                 That's it.     

282
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,869
 The thing's heavy.             

283
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:07,938
Definitely got to hunch         
    on this one.                

284
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,809
Mm. The ground beef has got     
 fantastic texture.             

285
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,745
   The grind size,              
  the griddle temp,             

286
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:16,014
 the caramelization,            
  great bun choice.             

287
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:18,816
    The pickle is               
 definitely needed.             

288
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,217
 That balances out.             

289
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:22,621
Got a lot of richness           
and delicious pimento cheese.   

290
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,956
I didn't know it was going to be
a whole patty of pimento.       

291
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,624
You better bring an appetite    
    on that one.                

292
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,759
  SERVER: Pimento cheeseburger. 

293
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,294
            It's the best burger
                  in town.      

294
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:32,363
 As soon as I ate it, taste buds
     went through the roof.     

295
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,631
        It's like, "Wow!"       

296
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,634
So much labor in everything     
 you're doing. Why?             

297
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,503
        Because we're so focused
               on local foods,  

298
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,038
               we want to get   
             scratch ingredients

299
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,840
 because that's what the farmers
             have to sell to us.

300
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:43,441
    I love this.                
I mean, I applaud this.         

301
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,376
    Every day you're in here,   
  you're going to see a farmer. 

302
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,844
  Coming in, making deliveries. 

303
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,913
  -I'm a local organic farmer.  
             -Okay.             

304
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:50,448
       A restaurant that sources

305
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,717
           primarily local food,
               that was huge.   

306
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,919
       That's part of why       
     it's all so delicious.     

307
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:56,254
All right, what are we          
going to make next, brother?    

308
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:57,522
            Old-world bratwurst.

309
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,056
      Hang on.                  
Don't tell me about it.         

310
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,258
  We're hanging out             
  at The Root Cafe              

311
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,727
We're in Little Rock, Arkansas. 
 When we come back,             

312
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:04,729
we're making the bratwurst      
 with the crazy guy.            

313
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:05,996
         Old-world brat.        

314
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,265
             It's the way a brat
               should be made.  

315
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,000
    FIERI: "I'll take a brat    
        with sauerkraut."       

316
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,770
   "It's 8:30 in the morning."  
   "Okay, I'll take two then."  

317
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:16,975

     "Triple-D."                

319
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:20,978
Hanging out in Little Rock,     
Arkansas, at The Root Cafe,     

320
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,249
a full-scratch menu focusing on 
local farms and local producers 

321
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,918
   that is crazy.               

322
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,554
 WOMAN: It's got a good spirit. 
     It's got a good energy.    

323
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:31,456
   When they put it together,   
    they have an artist side.   

324
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,524
      FIERI: And definitely     
      a chef's taste buds.      

325
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,393
  It's delicious comfort food,  

326
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:37,262
      but it has a special,     
          little twist.         

327
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:38,463
            Old-world bratwurst.

328
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:39,931
       It's the way a brat      
         should be made.        

329
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,999
     I like the sauerkraut.     
    That's my favorite part.    

330
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,535
   FIERI: What are              
  we going to make?             

331
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:45,603
                We are casing   
          fresh bratwurst today.

332
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:46,871
So, we have the ground          
   pork shoulder.               

333
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,939
 We're going to add kosher salt,
                white pepper,   

334
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:51,076
          ground ginger, nutmeg,
                   mix it       

335
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:52,943
             a little bit to get
        the spices incorporated,

336
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:54,812
                  whisk up      
          these farm-fresh eggs,

337
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,548
   and we're going to stir those
           into our heavy cream.

338
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,016
    Interesting.                
    Pull it out.                

339
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:00,752
We're going to go to case.      

340
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:03,087
We'll pick the sausages and then
    we'll twist them into links.

341
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,556
      Grill it to get that color
                on the sides,   

342
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:05,957
         and then we're going to
            throw it in the oven

343

        to finish at a low temp.

  While that works,             
   we make kraut.               

345
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,763
        This is lacto-fermented,

349
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,168
         We got to set ourselves
               apart somehow.   

350
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,970
The setting-yourself-apart      
 factor has happened            

351
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:20,371
  a long time ago.

      Kosher salt, caraway seed.

00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:23,775
      Pound and stir, and that's
                going to help

the goldfish water is for?      

360

363
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:42,994

364
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:44,796

373
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:58,810
