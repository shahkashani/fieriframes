 smear we're gonna put on there.

73

79
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:31,016

      water combination in.

    we usually like to use bread

00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,969
        that's a day or two old,

00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:51,970
                 a lot more

  the batter here.

Whole eggs, whole milk,         
  some heavy cream,             

94
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:59,711
fresh Vermont maple syrup,      
right into the batter.          

95
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:00,979
Cinnamon flavored rum.

Then we put some more           
cinnamon in here, too.          

98
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,317

00:03:07,922 --> 00:03:09,588

             fresh baked bread. 

101
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,624
Let it soak up the batter.      
Drop them in the deep fryer.

00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,125
   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,868

00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:41,153

118
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:43,888

it's creamy all the way through.

119
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,357

       a little bit of the syrup

                   inside

121

             for your meatloaf. 

142
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,738
It's not on both our lunch,     
and our dinner menu.            

143
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,873
           So let's get started.

144
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,074
 We're startin' with            
  some ground veal,             

145
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:38,009
then we have ground beef,       
 chuck, and brisket,            

146
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,877
ground pork, and some           
 panko bread crumbs.            

147
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,414
                        Okay.   
Worcestershire sauce,           
    eggs up next.               

148
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,816
Red and green peppers,          
yellow and sweet onion,         

149
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,886
salt, pepper, garlic            
powder, onion powder.           

150
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:50,555
Then our Italian blend, basil,  
oregano, thyme, rosemary.       

151
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:51,889
    Brown sugar.                

152
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,758
      We're running out of stuff
             in the shop, buddy.

153
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,093
It can't be meatloaf            
  without ketchup.              

154
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:56,628
                 Right in to it.
Blend it together.              

155
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,297
        The key here is gonna be
    not to mix this up too much.

156
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,766
            It's gonna be tough,
   it'll press all your fat out.

157
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,702
We'll cook that in the baking   
oven for an hour and a half,    

158
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:05,170
 and then we'll put             
 a ton of glaze on.             

159
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:06,437
             What in this glaze?

160
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,039
Worcestershire, brown sugar,    
    and ketchup.                

161
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,508
And then we let it bake it      
for about another half hour     

162
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,042
  to let that glaze             
  fully caramelize.             

163
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,177

00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,236

    I like to use grape seed oil
              when I'm cooking.

that's taking forever?

565
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:23,234
  You're like this              
culinary Obi-Wan Kenobi.        

566
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:24,234
   Charlie has his own style.   

567
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,236
   Healthy, good quality food.  

568
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:27,638
   Gnocchi kale on the window.  

569
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,373
 Having the gnocchi and kale -- 

570
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,042
      It's one of Charlie's     
         famous dishes.         

571
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:32,910
   It's absolutely delicious.   

572
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:35,046
This is not the way I           
typically start my gnocchi,     

573
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:36,313
    with a potato               
 and a tray of salt.            

574
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,448
But I'm here to learn.          

575
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,916
     AYERS: We bake our potatoes
                on rock salt.   

576
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:40,384
           I find that it really
       conducts the heat better,

577
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:42,052
                and gives it    
               a better flavor  
     Okay.                      

578
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:43,787
       So we're gonna bake these
         in the oven around 375,

579
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,989
             for about an hour, 
              hour and a half.  

580
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:47,124
  On this salt bed?             
                       Yes.     

581
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,193
             Take 'em out, while
             they're still hot. 

582
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:50,260
               Peel 'em back.   

583
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,662
So I think that salt's          
really pulling a bunch          

584
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:53,464
of your moisture out.           
    That's great.               

585
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,865
Makes it a much easier          
potato to work with.            

586
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,133
                  Totally.      

587
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,602
   Everybody loves              
  mashed potatoes.              

588
00:18:57,604 --> 00:18:59,937
Food mill, or a ricer.          
    Just try it.                

589
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:01,806
That light little fluffy        
mixture that he's got,          

590
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:04,208
   is the greatest              
 thing to work form.            

591
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,210
    Look at this.               
      Pillows.                  

592
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:07,745
I'd eat here every day.         

593
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:11,082
Little salt, some ground pepper,
               and some flour.  

594
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:12,616
             Touch of olive oil.

595
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,685
And the key is, to not          
overwork the mashed potato,     

596
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,019
   and make it all              
glutenous and gummy.            

597
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,822
          Gummy. Now we're ready
              to roll this out. 

598
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,891
        Okay.                   

599
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:21,292
           So what I like to do,
              is I freeze them. 

600
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:22,693
Freeze 'em?                     
               Drop it frozen.  

601
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:25,830
 I feel that starches amalgamate
         better with the potato.

602
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:29,100
          Add our grape seed oil
               to our gnocchi.  

603
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:31,235
 So Brussels sprouts            
  off the mandolin.             

604
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:32,369
I love Brussels sprouts.        

605
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:33,837
            Get a nice color on,
                 all around.    

606
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,772
        A little salt and       
         pepper to that.        

607
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:36,707
         All right, add         
       the kale in there.       

608
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:37,975
 I mean, it's very simple food. 

609
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:39,443
Boy did it pack the flavor.     

610
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:40,845
         Small amount of garlic.

611
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,913
       A little bit of the water
         from cooking the pasta.

612
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,314
       Got it.                  

613
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:46,984
           A little chili flake,
some crushed California walnuts.

614
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:48,786
    Oh, my gosh.

616
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:54,792
Mmm. The gnocchi's like         
clouds, little puffs.           

617
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:58,496
The walnut is such a surprising,
great texture in there.         

618
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:02,533
It's so good, I could even      
have it without the gnocchi.    

619
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,603
Straight forward simple,        
but done in balance.            

620
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:07,004
