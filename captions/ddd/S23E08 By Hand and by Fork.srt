00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:02,133
         Hey, everybody.        

2
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:03,601
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:06,938
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

4
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,673
          -This trip...         
            -Tell me!           

5
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,676
        ...we're digging        
      into killer dishes...     

6
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:12,611
                 Holy moly.     

7
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:14,813
         ...and grabbing        
      a fistful of flavor.      

8
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:15,814
   That's awesome.              

9
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:17,816
    In Bayport, Minnesota...    

10
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:18,817
                   I think      
             I've met my match. 

11
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:20,819
         ...a family-run        
        barbecue joint...       

12
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:21,953
            Way to live it, man.

13
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:23,822
      ...all about doing it     
           their way.           

14
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:25,090
        It's kind of your world.

15
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:27,359
         We're just all rotating
            around it right now.

16
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,961
  In Falmouth, Massachusetts... 

17
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:30,362
I'll take any of that.          

18
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:31,964
  ...a cozy New England café... 

19
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:33,098
   Small portions,              
     I can tell.                

20
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,100
         ...going South         
     for the bomb breakfast.    

21
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:37,635
 So, I'm all the way            
in Cape Cod having Tex-Mex.     

22
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:39,304
   And in Denver, Colorado...   

23
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:40,372
   Do you like it?              

24
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:41,906
          Little more than like.

25
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:43,442
     ...an empanada empire.     

26
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:45,444
   If you look in the dictionary
              under "empanada," 

27
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:46,445
      that's what it looks like.

28
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:49,247
        ...that's enough        
   to bring a tear to my eye.   

29
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,517
                     Ay!        

30
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:53,519
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

31
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:55,520

33
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,002
 So, I'm here on South Broadway 

34
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,739
        about 10 minutes        
 from downtown Denver, Colorado,

35
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,674
      to check out a joint      
       with a great story.      

36
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:17,008
      Now, check this out.      

37
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,344
       The chef, she came       
  from Buenos Aires, Argentina, 

38
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:20,345
          12 years ago.         

39
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:23,014
   Now, she's got an empanada   
             empire.            

40
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,017
     This is Maria Empanada.    

41
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:29,621
            Carprese.           

42
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:31,490
        Nothing compares        
       to Maria Empanada.       

43
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:33,959
   You really feel like you're  
        in a little part        

44
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:35,360
        of Buenos Aires.

             [ Speaks Spanish ] 

46
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:39,831
          You can feel          
  that it's made with passion.  

47
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:43,835
  FIERI: And determination, all 
 from owner Lorena Cantarovici. 

48
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,970
               So, how did you  
  get from Buenos Aires to here?

49
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:48,440
I just grabbed $300,            
     a backpack,                

50
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:52,644
and three words in English --   
"Hi, hello, and ciao."          

51
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:55,113
                    Ciao?       
            Ciao is not English.

52
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,449
                 And how did    
      the empanada empire start?

53
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,317
Because I miss it a lot,        

54
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,920
and I didn't find any empanada  
   here in Denver,              

55
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:03,055
so I need to make it.           

56
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:04,790
       And does she ever.       

57
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:08,393
    Since opening the joint,    
  named after her mom, in 2011, 

58
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:12,864
      she now cranks out --     
 get this -- up to 1,500 a day. 

59
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,065
 You would think there's an army

60
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,067
       back in the kitchen      
        making empanadas.       

61
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,936
                How authentic   
            are these empanadas?

62
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:19,071
  They could learn              
    in Argentina.               

63
00:02:19,073 --> 00:02:20,672
               That authentic?  

64
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,273
         Beef empanadas.        

65
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,075
    I love the beef empanada.

              MAN:              
  Ground beef, onions, peppers, 

67
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:28,347
        seasoning wrapped       
  in, like, a turnover pastry.  

68
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:29,548
          It's amazing.         

69
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,350
              -So?              
 -We're going to make the dough,

70
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:33,685
   and we will put              
   some salt here.              

71
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:35,354
         -Baking powder.        
      -And then margarine.      

72
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:36,554
       -All-purpose flour?      
              -Yes.             

73
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:37,622
                    Okay.       

74
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:40,892
Now, we will put some eggs      
     and water.                 

75
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,361
         This is going to mix up
                  how long?     

76
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:44,029
 Around 10 minutes.             

77
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:45,964
   We let it rest.              

78
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,498
    Rub the baby.               

79
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,833
            What'd you just say?

80
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,034
      My baby.                  

81
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,637
                    Okay,       
       so now you take the baby?

82
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:55,373
Okay, and then we take it       
   to<i> la máquina.</i>               

83
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,375
                   This is      
           the empanada express?

84
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,510
        Yes.                    

85
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,379
It keeps disappearing           
to the end of the table.        

86
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:04,115
   Oh, don't worry. Don't worry.
             It will come back. 

87
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,317
                You like it?    

88
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:08,187
   That's awesome.              

89
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:10,322
       Look how beautiful it is.

90
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:13,592
And we do like this.            

91
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:15,527
And that's empanada dough.      

92
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,663
     And now we're going to make
                   the...?      

93
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:19,464
            -Filling.           
          -The filling.         

94
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,333
This is corn oil, okay?         

95
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:23,669
   And then we put              
    some onions.                

96
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:25,203
 We have red pepper.            

97
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,205
          -Okay, next?          
          -Ground beef.         

98
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,907
          Who taught you to make
                 empanadas?     

99
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,208
       My mom.                  

100
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,946
So, we put some salt here.      
    Look at this.               

101
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:35,013
       Pepper.                  

102
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,948
 Crushed red pepper.            

103
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:37,949
                   Comino.

  Spanish paprika.              

106
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,022
           -Not spicy?          
           -No spice.           

107
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:46,291
    We are going                
   to let it cool.              

108
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:47,558
                    Okay,       
      what are we going to make?

    -Wait, wait, wait, wait.    
    -What, what, what, what?    

113
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:54,766
            This is chimichurri,
              with red pepper?  

114
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:56,501
 The authentic one.             

115

                     Oh.

231
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:24,703
       That reminds me of almost
               like a calzone.  

232
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:26,938
                Nice, bright,   
              fresh vegetables  

233
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,107
      that keeps that little bit
   of cream cheese, a little bit

234
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:31,309
          of acid at the bottom,
        and a little bit of fat,

235
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:33,912
and you're able to eat it almost
  like you're eating a sandwich.

236
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,680
               People dig it.   

237
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:40,585
      Tarta Analia, please.     

238
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:43,988
    It's light and delicate.    
   I could do a few of these.   

239
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,258
      You can't wait to get     
 to your table and dive into it.

240
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,928
        Nothing compares        
       to Maria Empanada.       

241
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,663
             People ask me about
 "Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives,"

242
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,398
                and are like,   
          "What are the places?"

243
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,466
                 This is it.    

244
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:56,067
            You got a character,

245
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:58,937
              you got a story,  
         and you got great food.

246
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:00,705
     Thank you.                 

247
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:05,343
        FIERI: Coming up,       
    in Bayport, Minnesota...    

248
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:06,478
                Look at this.   

249
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,680
       ...smoking, blues,       
         and barbecue...        

250
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:10,415
       I give you all the props,
              all the respect.  

251
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,049
         ...just the way        
      this family likes it.     

252
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,752
              This is maybe one 
       of the more unique styles

253
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:14,753
        on "Triple D" I've seen.

254
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,630
You see, even when it's raining,

255
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:27,832
       I'm out looking for      
great "Triple D" joints for you.

256
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,367
 I'm here in Bayport, Minnesota,

257
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:30,835
right on the Wisconsin border --

258
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:33,104
          Little town,          
      about 3,400 people --     

259
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:36,041
  to check out a barbecue joint 
 that's run by the family only. 

260
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:37,175
      There's no employees.     

261
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,577
         Their motto is,        
    "We aren't for everyone."   

262
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,713
      This is Bayport BBQ.

     what we got going on ♪     

265
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:50,255
    MAN: It's one of the best   
         barbecue places        

266
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,924
  I have ever been in the U.S.  

267
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,792
    Great food, great music.    

268
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,927
              MAN:              
  It's amazing to have it here  
  in the small town of Bayport. 

269
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:00,465
  Couple bars, couple churches, 
  and one great barbecue place. 

270
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:01,866
I have more cornbread           
     coming up.                 

271
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,401
  The whole family works here.  

272
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:05,870
    FIERI: Led by mom Kristen   
     and dad Chris Johnson,     

273
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:08,673
           who traded           
in a buttoned-down corporate gig

274
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:11,609
 to do their own thing in 2010. 

275
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,277
I'm a pretty independent        
    kind of guy.                

276
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,480
Our music is different,         
our food is different,          

277
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:16,547
our bar's different.            

278
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,949
   We have a full               
   liquor license,              

279
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:21,286
but we choose just to sell beer,
wine, white whiskey.            

280
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,888
     You don't sell French fries
                 because...?    

281
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,156
 Just choose not to.            

282
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:26,758
                 Holy moly.     

283
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,426
      You know,                 
we aren't for everyone.         

284
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:31,228
    And you'd better be okay    
  with fetching your own food,  

285
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,297
       I mean, literally,       
     right from the kitchen.    

286
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,632
    They have a buffet line.    

287
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,301
     And you can go through     
   as many times as you want.   

288
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,369
I'll have more brisket          
   in one second.               

289
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,838
     I want Chris to tuck me    
         in bed at night        

290
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,509
         under a blanket        
      made of this brisket.     

291
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:45,977
Should we make some rub         
  for the brisket?              

292
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,513
           I don't know, can we?
        Okay, let's get into it.

293
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,181
   So, we do start              
with salt and pepper.           

294
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:53,251
Season salt, onion powder,      
   garlic powder,               

295
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:55,720
granulated onion, paprika.      

296
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,656
            -Cayenne.           
       -Red pepper flakes.      

297
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:00,125
    Little cumin.               

298
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:01,393
                    Okay.       

299
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:03,661
We do a full choice brisket,    

300
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,131
  -Just generously apply it on. 
     -Not going to trim it.     

301
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:08,066
      -No, we want the fat.     
          -Yeah, we do.         

302
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:09,400
           And what kind of wood
              we smoking with?  

303
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,803
     White oak.                 
About 13 hours, 250.            

304
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:13,071
              Ooh. Running hot. 

305
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:15,339
     -Yeah, it works for us.    
        -Everything does.       

306
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,541
        It's kind of your world.

307
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:19,144
         We're just all rotating
            around it right now.

308
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:20,211
Let's make some bread.          

309
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:21,345
             We're going to make
                 the bread.     

310
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,547
It's a very simple recipe.      

311
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,216
          -Just water.          
             -Okay.             

312
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:27,752
    Yeast, salt,                
high-gluten bread flour.        

313
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:30,221
         Like pizza-dough flour.

314
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:31,689
         -And that's it.        
           -That's it.          

315
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,426
It goes into a grease tub.      
Let it rest for 10, 12 hours.   

316
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,427
   Should we shape              
    some loaves?                

317
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,162
                I don't know.   
                You tell me.    

318
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,830
  We'll oil a pan.              

319
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:41,899
             Do people come here
        and buy a loaf of bread?

320
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,035
        Yes.                    
Our bread is very popular.      

321
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,236
     That cornmeal's the kicker.

322
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:47,105
   Shape the loaf               
and put it in the pan.          

323
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:49,107
      -This'll poof again.      
     -Another couple hours.     

324
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:50,842
And then a little more          
  cornmeal on top.              

325
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:52,777
And then we bake it in the oven.
                 What temp?     

326
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,445
425 for about 15 minutes.       

327
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,247
           -That's it.          
           -That's it.          

328
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:59,517
           It's like a ciabatta.
             Oh, that's awesome.

329
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,585
So, we do this into thirds.     

330
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:02,787
                Look at this.   

331
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,922
We do over a half pound.        

332
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,123
                [ Whistles ]    

333
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,459
        Slaw.                   
Bread and butter pickles.       

334
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:09,794
              Okay. That's it.  

335
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:10,862
     That's it.                 

336
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:15,400
              Very simply done. 

337
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,268
              I love the bark,  
              I love the smoke. 

338
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,137
          It's true, real smoke.

339
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,272
      It's not super-pull-apart.

340
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:23,341
   It should have               
    some texture.               

341
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:26,477
     Of course, you haven't seen
     me stop eating any of this.

342
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,679
 -That bread, it's outstanding. 
             -Yeah.             

343
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:31,349
        I give you all the props
          for doing it your way.

344
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:32,750
      I think I've met my match.

345
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:36,087
   The brisket is really good.  
      Thick and it's juicy.     

346
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,955
 I always, always get the bread.

347
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,558
      It's just delicious.      

348
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,759
             WOMAN:             
     It's really a fun place    

349
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,360
    to just come and hang out   
       with your friends,       

350
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:45,963
    have some good barbecue,    
      listen to live music.     

351
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,565
    -How are the blues here?    
          -Underground.         

352
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,100
       -Underground blues.      
             -Yeah.             

353
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:54,438
        It sets it apart        
 from any other barbecue joint. 

354
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,841
       MAN: Blues that you      
   wouldn't hear anywhere else  

355
00:12:56,843 --> 00:13:00,311
      but either down south     
 or here in Bayport, Minnesota. 

356
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:04,048
  And you get to feed yourself  
     this amazing barbecue.     

357
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:08,252
  Pulled pork is super tender,  
          really juicy.         

358
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:11,055
  All-over-your-face delicious. 

359
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,924
        -Pork butt time.        
             -Yeah.             

360
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:14,191
    So, the same dry rub we had.

361
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:15,393
Same rub for everything.        

362
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:17,461
       All right, in the smoker.
                 What temp?     

363
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,396
   250, overnight.              
   About 13 hours.              

364
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:20,598
                    Okay.       

365
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,600
  -We're making barbecue sauce. 
          -There we go.         

366
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:24,269
We smoke the tomatoes           
     and onions.                

367
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:25,336
                    Okay.       

368
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:29,406
   And we puree it              
with some tomato juice.         

369
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:30,942
Now we'll strain the puree,     

370
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:32,810
 -and add the other ingredients.
             -Okay.             

371
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,413
    -Ketchup, Worcestershire.   
        -Worcestershire.        

372
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:37,014
              Where'd you learn 
     to make the barbecue sauce?

373
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,216
  Trial and error.              

374
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:40,485
                 At a place     
              you used to work? 

375
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,487
   Our house rub,               
chipotles in adobo sauce.       

376
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,622
                    Okay.       

377
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:46,157
             -Honey.            
            -Darling.           

378
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,292
     Wildflower.                

379
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:48,693
                 Chickapea.     

380
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:49,827
   Minced garlic.               

381
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,030
          -A lot of it.         
           -Hot sauce.          

382
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:53,364
          -Lemon juice.         
             -Okay.             

383
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:56,634
Apple cider vinegar.            
   Yellow mustard.              

384
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:58,436
        -And brown sugar.       
            -Really?            

385
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:01,839
So, this will go on the stovetop
  for a few hours.              

386
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,575
                 All right,     
           so the butts be done.

387
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:05,976
             Look at that bark. 
                 All right.     

388
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:07,311
Do you want to serve            
  your own platter?             

389
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,615
            Oh, I would love to.

390
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:16,787
         Tender pork, nice butt,
                 good smoke.    

391
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,990
             Right in the realm 
               of pulled pork.  

392
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:22,460
               Love that bark.  

393
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:25,263
            Little bit of sweet,
             little bit of tang,

394
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:26,798
       a lot of tomato, texture.

395
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,733
              Really good smoke 
              in the barbecue.  

396
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,802
   -I'd eat that all day long.  
           -Thank you.          

397
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:33,004
   Pulled pork is super juicy   
         and delicious.         

398
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:34,005
    MAN: Put it on a sandwich   

399
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:35,606
        with the coleslaw       
      and all the fixings,      

400
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:38,142
      and 10 napkins later,     
          you're full.          

401
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:43,815
  The family works together to  
 make it a great place to visit.

402
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:45,884
              This is maybe one 
       of the more unique styles

403
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,285
        on "Triple D" I've seen.

404
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:48,619
              You're living it  
               your way, man.   

405
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,088
-I got to give you props for it.
            -Thanks.            

406
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,422
            Way to like it, man.

407
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:54,025
        FIERI: Up next...       

408
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:55,560
   a Falmouth, Massachusetts,   
             café...            

409
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:56,761
    I like this.                

410
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:58,363
That's like patting your stomach
and rubbing your head.          

411
00:14:58,365 --> 00:14:59,631
         ...stacking up         
        the sandwiches...       

412
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:01,098
    This is what                
 you're looking for.            

413
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,569
 ...and putting a righteous spin
          on rancheros.         

414
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,204
Real deal. Great job.           
   Delicious dish.              

415
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:15,279
       I'm just like you.       

416
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,281
 I roll into a town, I'm looking
     for a "Triple D" joint.    

417
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,484
         And long before        
      there was "Triple D,"     

418
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,819
   I was here in this town --   
    Falmouth, Massachusetts.    

419
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:24,355
 I was ready to catch a ferry to
 head over to Martha's Vineyard.

420
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:26,024
    I was looking for a place   
             to eat.            

421
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:27,625
     Man, I wish this joint     
         had been open.         

422
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:29,394
    This is Parkside Market.    

423
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:35,967
       Green eggs and ham.      

424
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:38,635
    I would come here any day   
     for breakfast or lunch.    

425
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:39,904
           John Alden.          

426
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:43,841
      Feels like homegrown,     
          local flare.          

427
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:45,710
             WOMAN:             
 It's a very hearty restaurant. 

428
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:48,179
    They're just a wonderful,   
  hardworking group of people.  

429
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:50,448
        FIERI: That group       
    is husband and wife team    

430
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,783
    Stephen and Susan Bowen,    

431
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,452
        and their partner       
    and chef Anthony Carroll.   

432
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,786
   How do you all               
  know each other?              

433
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,122
  -How did this come together?  
-We all met in Florida, working.

434
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,391
        -Who's from here?       
            -No one.            

435
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:03,260
FIERI: But the town's definitely
   welcomed these transplants   

436
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:06,197
   since they opened the joint  
            in 2013.            

437
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:08,466
       Local and organic,       
     everything's delicious.    

438
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,135
  When you're feeling like you  
  need a good breakfast feast,  

439
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,204
       -this is the place.      
      -Tex-Mex with bacon.      

440
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:15,006
    The Tex-Mex is very good.   

441
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:18,942
     Homemade corn patty on     
 a pico sauce, black bean humus.

442
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:21,012
   It's what I come here for.   

443
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:23,213
        Kind of like our version
            of huevos rancheros.

444
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:24,949
"Huevos" means eggs.            

445
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,417
            We're not doing eggs
               for you today.   

446
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,419
           I can do some sausage
         or some bacon on there.

447
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:30,287
I'll take any of that.          
All right, let's get into it.   

448
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:31,956
            We're going to start
   with our homemade corn cakes.

449
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,358
            We've got our sugar,
            pureed corn kernels,

450
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,292
               vegetable oil.   

451
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,495
             -Okay.             
          -Some water.          

452
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,830
              And blended eggs. 

453
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,431
     -And then we'll add --     
          -All the dry.         

454
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:43,101
              We have cornmeal. 
              Our masa harina.  

455
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:45,370
                Corn kernels,   
            cheddar Jack cheese.

456
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:48,639
           And some kosher salt,
    and our cold chopped butter.

457
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:50,641
              Just going to mix 
             our wet real quick,

458
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:53,311
 -and our dry at the same time. 
          -I like this.         

459
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:57,448
That's like patting your stomach
and rubbing your head.

00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,583
 So, I'm all the way            
in Cape Cod having Tex-Mex.

00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,052
                 From a guy     
            who's from Missouri.

    -Ready to rock 'n' roll.    

463
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:04,922
       Got it.                  

464
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:06,057
     All right.                 

465
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,126
             We're going to make
           our black bean humus.

466
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:11,529
    Start with some black beans,
               garbanzo beans.  

467
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,131
           We'll do some garlic,
                  as well.      

468
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,733
         Little salt and pepper.

469
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:20,938
              And a little oil. 

470
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,340
                 All right,     
            plating our Tex-Mex.

471
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:24,942
            We'll start with our
      hot tomato sauce and pico.

472
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:27,078
   -Same portions, I can tell.  
           -Oh, yeah.           

473
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,547
              And then we'll do 
               our corn cakes.

476
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:35,486
       we're going to do sausage
                 and bacon.     

477
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:37,888
                And finally,    
        we top with our avocado,

478
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,624
              and there you go. 

479
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:46,364
        Yeah.

481
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:54,972
I really like the texture       
on the cornmeal cake.           

482
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:59,710
The warm pico on top of it      
pulls everything together.      

483
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:02,246
My favorite honestly,           
of all of it, though,           

484
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,249
is the black bean humus.        

485
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,384
Mm. Real deal. Great job.       
   Delicious dish.              

486
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,320
      For you, the Tex-Mex.

00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:10,588
    It's just a great combo.

        breakfast go-to.

       because their food       
 is really fresh and delicious. 

492
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,731
    It's a lot like Waterside   
      on Martha's Vineyard.

       Yep, that's right,       

494

Parkside has a sister restaurant
     right across the water.    

495
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,337
    Go from one to the other,   

496

 -and the consistency is there. 
        -French Quarter.

at another sandwich store.      

498

         Wait a second, you work
      at another sandwich place,

00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:38,415
This is my favorite spot.       
And cab sandwich is my favorite.

501
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,484
   Cab with fries, pick it up.  

502
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:44,421
Chicken, some ranch dressing,   
crispy bacon, avocado.          

503
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:46,691
So, everything I love.          

504
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:48,292
  What's this for?              
  What's the dish?              

505
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,426
            This is for our cab.

00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:50,827
Chicken almost burger?          

507
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,229
        Chicken, avocado, bacon.

508
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:55,299
Chicken avocado. Oh!            
      So close.                 

509
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:58,903
          So, we just start with
 all-natural breasts of chicken,

510
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:01,973
               a little salt,   
      pepper, granulated garlic,

511
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,575
             and then we hit it 
               with some oil.   

512
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:07,311
                 Rub it in.     
    And then thyme and tarragon.

513
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:11,582
    -In the oven. What temp?    
   -350 for 30 to 40 minutes.   

514
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:13,251
           -All right.          
  -Now we're going to slice it? 

515
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:14,851
                    Yeah.       
         We like it pretty thin,

516
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:17,188
                   just so      
            we can pile it high.

517
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,589
  We're going to do some ranch  
         on the bottom.         

518
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:22,059
             -Okay.             
        -Sliced chicken.

00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:25,396
         Vermont cheddar, bacon.

                   for us.      

521
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,800
         -Melt all that.        
   -Melt all that and activate

523
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:32,870
               Now we're going  
             to add the avocado.

524
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:36,340
                Finish it off

    Nicely done.                

529
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:48,953
 If it's going to be            
a simple sandwich like that,    

530
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:50,354
you've got to put everything    
      together.                 

531

532
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:55,626

plays the key into it.          

533
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:59,096
The roasted chicken's nice,     
    not too dry.
