460
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,195
Yeah, that's when most people   
just jump right off the end.    

461
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:06,130
 Just jump right off

There you go.

                Mr. Whitner's   
               barbecue sauce.  

471
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,017
      You don't want to be      
      like this, you know.      

472
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:28,018
Alright, Mr. Whitner's          
    barbecue rub.               

473
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,153
             Okay. Lot of salt. 

474
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,955
     Then we go                 
with the brown sugar            

475
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:32,223
and some black pepper.          

476
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:33,558
               And that's it.   
You got it.                     

477
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,360
       What's that fantastic hum
               I keep hearing?  

478
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:38,295
Oh, it's our smoker.            

479
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:41,765
It goes 24 hours a day.         

480
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,167
                  Hit this      
           all over the brisket.

481
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,103
And let that seasoning work     
    its way down                

482
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:46,704
  through the meat              
   as we cook it.               

483
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:47,972
               From what temp?  
    200.                        

484
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:49,773
         For how many hours? 12.
12. Yep.                        

485
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:50,775

00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:54,378
          with the way          
   that we smoked the brisket.  

488
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,913
  Is that working?              

489
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:58,249
             Genuine, good beef,

490
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:01,518
           nice rub, good smoke,
               rendered down.   

491
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,920
                 Way to go.     

492
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:05,256
 MAN #4: The brisket in general 
  here is one of my favorites.  

493
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,525
     It's smoky, it's juicy.    
     It's got a nice crust.     

494
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,460
FIERI: And they're serving it up
            in style.           

495
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,731
   And the brisket is gonna go  
          right on top          

496
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,332
     of just a simple piece     
         of white bread.        

497
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:19,404
    And we will smother this    
    with our homemade gravy.    

498
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:22,606
  It just starts with a simple  
    roux of butter and flour.   

499
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:23,941
      Start with some salt,     

500
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:27,544
          chili powder,         
 garlic powder and onion powder.

501
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,948
   Whisk in our chicken stock   
   for about 5 to 10 minutes.   

502
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,683
       And at that point,       
   it will be ready to smother  

503
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:34,352
          our brisket.          

504
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:36,020
       Open-faced brisket.      

505
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:38,356
  WOMAN #2: This is absolutely  
         tender, juicy.         

506
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:39,490
        It was wonderful.       

507
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:40,958
      I don't want to share     
        with my husband.        

508
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,293
   WOMAN #3: It's almost like   
      a melt in your mouth.     

509
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:45,963
      Never had it before.      
       I would eat it lot.      

510
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:47,498
       WOMAN #4: I usually      
   get the open-faced brisket.  

511
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,100
      Well, it's a toss up      
between that and the burnt ends.

512
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,637
       We are widely known      
       for our burnt ends.      

513
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,038
               Check this out.  

514
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,907
  So we're making all burnt ends
                out of this?    

515
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,908
WARREN: Yes.                    
            Slice it into cubes.

516
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,444
You got it.                     
              Hit it with sauce.

517
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:01,512
  Okay, what sauce              
   are we making?               

518
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:04,849
                Sweet sauce.    
         A little white vinegar.

519
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:06,050
That'll clear you out.          

520
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:06,851
               Cider vinegar.   

521
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:07,919
Little chili powder.            

522
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,588
               You've got it.   
                   Pepper.      

523
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,323

             I can get on down. 

525
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:17,061
                 Ground mustard.
 Granulated garlic.             

526
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:18,062
                Onion powder.

528
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,999
             Some ground celery.
Mess of salt.                   

529
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:23,334
                There you go.

                       Yeah.    
More cider vinegar?             

535
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:32,343
                    Yeah.

00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:52,156
       Now we're gonna be       
   rubbing a bone-in pork butt  

573
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:53,691
     with our barbecue rub.     

574
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:56,093
       Get an even coating      
       all the way around.      

575
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:58,496
      Smoke this overnight      
         at 200 degrees.        

576
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:01,032
  Give it a quick, rough chop,  
  and then we'll just mix that  

577
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:04,702
     with our North Carolina    
         vinegar sauce.         

578
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,570
We have our chipotle mayonnaise.

579
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:07,905
      Lots of flavor here.      

580
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:10,174
       And then just have       
    our pickle pepper relish,   

581
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:11,976
           pulled pork          

582
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:13,577
      our smoked pork loin,     

583
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,379
     ham with melted Swiss.     

584
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,514
          Bun goes on.          

585
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:18,916
     So here we have our Bay    
        of Pigs sandwich.       

586
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:21,718
  MAN #5: The Bay of Pigs Cuban 
     sandwich is delicious.     

587
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,387
     A little bit of juice,     
      a little bit of tang.     

588
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,056
         You kind of get        
        that bite to it.        

589
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,857
          It's amazing.         

590
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:28,259
  I will tell you,              
       Warren,                  

591
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:29,993
you're rocking it out,          
        man.                    

592
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,462
Thanks for having me, man.      

593
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:32,596
  I need a t-shirt.             

594
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:35,866
                 You got it.    
             What size you wear?

595
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:37,801
             Big Ben            
   for the "Triple-D Nation."   

596
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:41,472
FIERI: But these joints are just
the tip of the barbecue iceberg.

597
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:44,141
        Got one wrap up.        
   Come get it while it's hot.  

598
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:45,943
        We'll be popping        
        into more places        

599
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:47,411
 next time on "Triple-D Nation."

600
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:50,481
           And the roof caved in
     and so I had to rebuild it.

601
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:51,482
   You remodeled?               

602
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:53,884
              Yeah, I remodel-- 
            I re-fixed the roof.

603
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:55,353
You re-fixed the roof.          
                         I did. 

604
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:56,954
            I repaired the roof.
                 How's that?    

605
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:58,823
        Let's get this straight.
  I don't know.
