226
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:50,701
         -The Big Papa.         
       -It's unbelievable.      

227
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:51,903
                It's so good.   

228
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,505
   You wrote in, and you told us
              about this place. 

229
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:55,974
    What was the inspiration?   
  -I had come here for dessert, 

230
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,376
       and found out that       
     they had amazing food.     

231
00:07:58,378 --> 00:07:59,711
         We were hooked.        

232
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:02,046
     FIERI: That savory menu    
  is the work of Jason Savely,  

233
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,249
       but it was his wife      
       Megan's sweet touch      

234
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:06,450
         that first got         
    this funky joint rolling.   

235
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:07,452
         Explain the name to me.

236
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:08,986
    -We started as a bakery.    
             -Right.            

237
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:12,257
So Frost Me Sweet seemed catchy,
 and we just were too well-known

238
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:14,192
          to change it          
  when we became a restaurant.  

239
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:15,259
               Now, how'd you   
               learn to cook?   

240
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,861
     My dad was                 
 a chef in the Navy.            

241
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:19,063
I'd never knew what was on      
 my kitchen counter             

242
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,198
 when I'd come home             
    from school.                

243
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,666
One day it'd be a sturgeon,     
    the next day                

244
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,134
it'd be a wild boar.            

245
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,736
      So, you're going after it.

246
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:26,337
              MAN:              
     We got a Duck Banh Mi.     

247
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,872
       Duck Banh Mi's got       
      a really good flavor.     

248
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,942
It's got the pickled vegetables,
       sweet chili sauce.       

249
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:33,478
        It's not a normal       
        duck experience.        

250
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,813
             All right, so what 
            are we making, Chef?

251
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,014
    Duck confit.                

252
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,482
              This is the basis 
       for the Banh Mi sandwich?

253
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:39,084
You betcha.                     
   We're bringing in whole duck.

254
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:40,484
Cutting it down.                
                Black pepper.   

255
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:43,288
Kosher salt, bay leaves,        
  drop our lard in,             

256
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,090
throw it in the oven at 250     
 for about 4 hours.             

257
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,892
     I am picking up what you're
         laying down, my friend.

258
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,027
This is our duck cooled.        

259
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,362
         What I'm talking about.

260
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,030
             So we're shred it, 
                de-bone it --   

261
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,898
          Keep shredding as fast
              as I can eat it.  

262
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,433
   All right.                   
We're gonna do a challenge here.

263
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:56,701
  [ Laughs ]                    
              That's delicious. 

264
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,103
        And what else do we have
        on the Banh Mi sandwich?

265
00:08:58,105 --> 00:08:59,904
   We make our own              
 sweet chili sauce.             

266
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,105
               Well, hurry up   
        and make the sweet chili

267
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,707
      before I eat all the duck.
     All right.                 

268
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,710
Sugar, rice vinegar,            
some soy sauce in there,        

269
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,846
Worcestershire sauce,           
crushed red chili flakes...     

270
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:08,914
                Very excited    
              about everything. 

271
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,248
...and some minced garlic.      

272
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,317
I love what I do, man.          
             Bro, it is evident.

273
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:14,986
I'm here seven days a week      
    out of love.                

274
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,922
Now we're gonna construct       
  our Duck Banh Mi.             

275
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:20,458
We got our buttered roll,       
throw our confit duck down --   

276
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,528
salt, a little pepper,          
hit with the sweet chili sauce. 

277
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,796
                 All right.     

278
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:28,400
Take our bun, mayo on here,     
cucumbers, our jalapeños.       

279
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:29,734
        That's a normal portion?

280
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,068
       It is.                   

281
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,671
Pickled veggies, garnish it     
with a little cilantro.         

282
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,674
           A duck Banh Mi is not
            what I was expecting

283
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:37,576
                   out of       
          a neighborhood bakery.

284
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:41,345
                 The duck is    
               re-dunk-ulous.   

285
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:43,682
                   That's       
             ri-duck-ulous duck.

286
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:46,818
         And whatever you choose
  to put that on would crush it.

287
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,954
          You know, duck has got
             that unctuous fat, 

288
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:50,155
                and it can be   
               so dominating.   

289
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:53,291
             But when you cut it
             with pickled veg...

290
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,159
              with great crunch 
             a little jalapeño, 

291
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,028
                  freshness     
           of the cucumber, bro,

292
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,630
          I'd come back for this
             on a regular basis.

293
00:09:58,632 --> 00:09:59,631
               Nice job, Chef.  
       Thanks.                  

294
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:01,232
       Got a Duck Banh Mi.      

295
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:02,566
             WOMAN:             
      It's just delicious.      

296
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:05,102
   It has a nice little bite,   
    but it's not overpowering   

297
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,839
And then that sweet chili sauce 
just is such a good compliment. 

298
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,106
     We have the Crab Melt.     

299
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,443
        After coming here       
        for three years,        

300
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,845
       driving 40 minutes       
  just for cupcakes and cakes,  

301
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:16,648
   I realize there was a whole  
 restaurant and bistro back here

302
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,249
that I never experienced before.

303
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,986
I have to come all the way      
to Southeast Washington         

304
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:24,122
to find this funky joint,       
run into a college friend,      

305
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,057
    her family --               
restaurant or bakery?           

306
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:27,926
          Restaurant --         
      Come here for lunch.      

307
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:30,261
         I would call it more of
     a restaurant myself, but --

308
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:31,396
              Restaurant, yeah. 

309
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:32,997
           Restaurant,          
    but I still think of them   

310
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,198
  whenever I need baked goods.  

311
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,201
             -Okay.             
   -They make beautiful cakes.

      flavors of cupcakes.

                       What?!   
       Yeah, I'm obsessed       
         with cupcakes.         

315
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,676
           You both are obsessed
               with something.  

316
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:46,144
     You can certainly gain     
          weight here.          

317
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,879
      What other little surprise
         you got up your sleeve?

321
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:58,223
     but without the noodle,    
the sweet potato makes the dish.

322
00:10:58,225 --> 00:11:00,258
             This I got to see. 
            We'll be right back.

                Welcome back.

        in Richland, Washington,

327
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,138
             at Frost Me Sweet.

                        Exactly.

      Sweet Potato Lasagna.     

333
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,617
   It's made with sweet potato  
        instead of pasta.       

334
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,086
    It's got beef and cheese,   

335
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:30,688
  and you get the side of pesto 
   toast, what I really love.   

336
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,290
                Why not just    
          regular lasagna, Chef?
