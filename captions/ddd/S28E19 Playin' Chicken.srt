 is perfect between             

526
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:09,920
the salt and the sweet          
  of the mirepoix.              

527
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,523
 What really gets me            
 the best, though...            
                  Mm-hmm.       

528
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:14,258
...is the tender texture        
    of the meat.                

529
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,193
 If you're gonna eat            
  all those carbs,              

530
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,729
    it better be                
    really good.                

531
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:20,064
      Well done, my friend.     
            -Spot on.           

532
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:22,800
              All righty, guys. 
          Tagliatelle Bolognese.

533
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:25,336
     The Bolognese is great.    
         Tasty noodles.         

534
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:27,071
            WOMAN #3:           
 You really get the meat flavor.

535
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:29,473
 It's one of my favorite dishes 
          to get here.          

536
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:30,675
            Coming up, linguine.

537
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:32,276
      MAN #3: Jacques uses      
    a lot of good techniques    

538
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:35,146
  that he's brought over. He's  
  able to put into his dishes.  

539
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:36,947
   FIERI: Including sous vide.  

540
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,483
    So, sous vide               
  is to vacuum seal             

541
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,018
   your vegetables              
  or your proteins,             

542
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,954
 and then throw them            
in an immersion circulator.     

543
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,289
Cook it at a precise            
temperature. Bring it out.      

544
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,025
It's cooked all the way through 
the exact same temperature.     

545
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:49,961
I have the chicken Vallée d'Auge
      for you.                  

546
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:53,230
 Oh, this chicken Vallée d'Auge 
     is flavorful and rich.     

547
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,699
            WOMAN #4:           
   The chicken is very tender,  

548
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:57,034
     and apples on top of it    
     add something special.     

549
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:58,769
     NAWAR: Now we're gonna make
          chicken Vallée d'Auge.

550
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:01,906
     So we take                 
the chicken breasts.            
                       Yeah.    

551
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:04,175
                    Salt.       
            <i> Piment d'Espelette.</i>

552
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:06,043
Oh, that's just what            
  I thought it was.             
                       Yeah.    

553
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:08,045
         It's French red pepper.

554
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:09,981
So we're gonna drop this        
into the vacuum sealer?         

555
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,382
                      Yes.      
  Let's do it.                  

556
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:13,651
 How long are these             
    gonna go in?                
                    40 minutes. 

557
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,185
What are we gonna do            
after we remove them?           

558
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,121
            It's already cooked,
         so we're gonna sear it.

559
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:18,256
 All we're gonna do.            

560
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:20,458
              We're gonna throw 
           some shallots, apple,

561
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,127
           <i> champignon de Paris,</i>
          and shiitake mushroom.

562
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:27,064
            Little salt, pepper,
                and Calvados.   

563
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:29,733
So, an apple brandy?            
                       Yep.     

564
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,335
                   <i> Voilà.</i>      
     <i> Voilà!</i>                    

565
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,203
   I knew what was              
going on here, folks!           
                        Yeah.   

566
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:34,472
                   Cider.       

567
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:35,873
   -Little bit of heavy cream?  
       -Heavy cream, yes.       

568
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,475
       Melt it                  
with some more butter.          

569
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:38,943
             Now we're gonna add
              the chicken back. 

570
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:40,944
               And that's it.   

571
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:42,946
                Sliced apple,   
                the mushroom.   

572
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:45,016
There's a little paprika        
   on the corner.               
                        Yeah.   

573
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:48,886
I can't say that there's been   
very many times in "Triple D,"  

574
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:50,087
   that we've done              
     sous vide.                 

575
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:51,822
     But one of                 
the beauties of sous vide,      

576
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:54,492
 it's cooked evenly             
    all the way.                

577
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:57,628
And you want to talk about      
the most tender chicken breast  

578
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,898
that you've ever had            
a chance to bite into.          
                         Yes.   

579
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,900
  Perfectly cooked              
to the right temperature.       

580
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:04,235
And it's so funny how...        

581
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:07,571
   ...we love pork              
     and apples.                

582
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:10,107
  I don't typically             
    have chicken.               
                      Yeah.     

583
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:11,776
  With a little bit             
  of the sweetness              

584
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:14,778
     and a little tartness.     
   -Makes a great combination.  

585
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,179
     Delicious.                 
                    Thank you.  

586
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,449
   SERVER: All right, I've got  
   the chicken Vallée d'Auge.   

587
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:20,050
 It's flavorful, but it's light.

588
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,786
 Very tender, hearty. Very good.

        Pizzeria Credo's        
    is one of our favorites.    

591
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:28,325
   It's delicious. It's fresh.  
 That's why I keep coming back. 

592
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:29,460
      I thought                 
  when I walked in              

593
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:31,128
    I was coming                
to a pizza restaurant.          
                    Yeah?       

594
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,530
 There's a lot more             
      going on.                 

595
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:34,065
  Well done, Chef.              
     Thank you.                 
                   Thank you.   

596
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:37,535
          So, that's it         
       for this road trip.      

597
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:38,869
        But don't worry!        

598
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:41,405
    We got plenty more joints   
 to find all over this country! 

599
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,073
         I'll be looking        
        for you next time

 I actually met you             
  a long time ago.              

602
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,214
I got in an elevator,           
  I turned around,              

603
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:51,415
 and you right there            
     behind me.                 

604
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,549
     I was like,                
"Man, I love your show."        

605
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,085
And you shook my hand.          
And I was just like,            

606
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,020
"Oh, my God. I can't believe    
he's here!" [ Laughs ]
