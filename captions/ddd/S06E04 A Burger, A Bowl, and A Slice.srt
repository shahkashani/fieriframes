                  THERE YOU GO. 

56
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:25,944
       YOU SAID ONE'S TOO FATTY,
       ONE'S TOO LEAN.          

57
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:28,814
        I'M JUST GONNA GO AHEAD

EXACTLY.                        

58
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:30,816
FAT MAN, HOW MUCH PEPPER?       

59
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:32,884
NOT MUCH, A LITTLE BIT OF SALT, 
AND A LITTLE BIT                
OF BREAD CRUMBS.                

60
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:34,686
       YOU'RE MAKIN' MEATBALLS? 

61
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,688
OUR REASON FOR DOING            
THE BREAD CRUMBS                

62
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:38,623
IS TO BASICALLY SEAL IN         
THE FLAVOR AND THE JUICES.      

63
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:41,159
     AND AS OPPOSED TO THAT FAT 
     MELTING OUT OF THERE,      

64
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:43,161
     IT'S GONNA SUCK UP         
     INTO THAT DRY BREAD CRUMB  
     AND IT'S GONNA STAY THERE. 

65
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,096
CORRECT.                        

66
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:47,032
        WHAT'S THE AVERAGE SIZE 
        BURGER HERE?            

67
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:48,967
HALF POUND,                     
THERE'S NO KIDS BURGERS HERE.   

68
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:50,902
SO YOU MEASURE 'EM OUT          
AHEAD OF TIME?                  

69
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:54,239
  I CAN PRETTY MUCH EYEBALL IT. 

70
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,141
WELL, GIVING AWAY THE FARM      
ON THAT ONE, QUINCE.            

71
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:58,176
            WHAT DID I DO, GUY? 
ABOUT 8.4.                      

72
00:02:58,212 --> 00:03:00,112
CAN WE HAND-FORM THIS?          

73
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:03,916
     NO, WE GOT A PATTY MACHINE 
     THAT SOME GREAT MIND       
     PUT TOGETHER FOR US.       

74
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:06,318
I SEE YOU'RE ANGRY WITH IT.     
                      YES, SIR.

UH-HUH, I USED TO GET IN TROUBLE
IN THE KITCHEN ALSO.            

77
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,390
               OKAY, THAT'S IT. 

78
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,860
I LIKE THE VARIETY OF OPTIONS   
OF TOPPINGS.                    

79
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,662

        THAT YOU WANT.          
   BLUE CHEESE, JALAPENO UP.    

80

        WITH BLUE CHEESE.       

81
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,400

82
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,335

85
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,141

          LITTLE SQUIRT-SQUIRT. 

88
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:36,614
THE STEAM REALLY MELTS IT       
FROM THE TOP.                   
                  YES, IT DOES.

00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,377
    THAT'S A BURGER DONE RIGHT. 
IT'S DELICIOUS.                 

100
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,513
         GREAT BURGER?          
                     EXCELLENT. 

101
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,448
          YES, AND ALL THE      
          OTHER GOODIES WITH IT.

102
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:12,451
    CUTTIN' OUR OWN ONIONS,     
    CUTTIN' OUR OWN POTATOES.   

103
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:14,385
SWEET POTATOES GOING DOWN.      

104
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,922
             (Guy)              
          EVEN SPICED           
    AND DEEP-FRIED PICKLES.     
SPICY PICKLES.                  

105
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:20,125
 A LITTLE BIT OF HEAT TO IT,    
 A LITTLE BIT OF VINEGAR TO IT, 
 IT'S A GREAT PICKLE.           

106
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,126
              HOMEMADE KETCHUP. 
        NO, SERIOUSLY?          

107
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:24,396
 (Guy)                          
 WITH ANCHO AND CHIPOTLE PASTE, 
 SUGAR, CAYENNE PEPPER,         

108
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,664
  AND SOMETHING THEY'RE KEEPIN' 
  TO THEMSELVES.                

109
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,533
  I'VE NEVER HAD                
  ANY KETCHUP LIKE THIS BEFORE. 

110
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:30,468
  REGULAR KETCHUP DOESN'T STAND 
  A CHANCE WITH IT.             

111
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:33,538
                   THEY CAN GET 
         THE REGULAR STUFF TOO. 
BUT YOU HAVE                    
THE TWISTED VERSION OF IT?      

112
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,207
 WE'VE GOT THE TWISTED VERSION. 
OF JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING.       

113
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:38,142
CHIPOTLE RANCH HOT DOG          
COMING OUT.                     

114
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:40,078
CINNAMON PECAN ROOT BEER.       

115
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:42,013
   AND IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT   
   DIFFERENT THAN ANYTHING      
   YOU'VE EVER TRIED BEFORE.    

116
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:43,882
      YOU'RE DEFINITELY         
      AT A DIFFERENT PLACE HERE 

117
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,284
               THAN YOU'VE EVER 
                BEEN TO BEFORE. 
       ORDER UP, JASON.         

118
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,686
THE OTHER BURGER PLACES,        
IT'S YOUR STANDARD HAMBURGER.   

119
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:52,156
             (Guy)              
           BUT HERE             
   THE STANDARD IS TWISTED.     
    BLUE CHEESE, JALAPENO.      

120
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,092
     (Guy)                      
     AND TWISTED SOME MORE.     

121
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:56,295
    I GOT A BUFFALO BURGER      
          COMIN' UP.            
                  BUFFALO MEAT. 

122
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,229
      (Guy)                     
      BLUE CHEESE AND JALAPENOS.

123
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,165
IT IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL,     
VERY JUICY.                     

124
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,234
      I CAN'T STOP THE BUFFALO  
      FROM FLYIN' OUT THE DOOR. 

125
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:04,369
       THERE'S YOU ANOTHER      
       NAKED BUFFALO.           

126
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:07,205
             (Guy)              
        AND HERE'S ONE          
     YOU DON'T SEE A LOT.       
VENISON.                        

127
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:09,107
        OOH, HOW IS IT?         
EXCELLENT.                      

128
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:11,176
WHAT DO WE GOT?                 
                  SOME VENISON, 
                 A LITTLE SALT, 

129
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,111
      A LITTLE BIT MORE         
      THAN WE HAD IN THE ANGUS. 

130
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:15,580
ON OUR ANGUS 77/23...           

131
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:19,050
         AND SOME PEPPER        
         AND SOME BREAD CRUMBS. 

132
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:21,252
NOT AS A FILLER,                
AS A RETAINER OF MOISTURE.      

133
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:24,055
      NOT LIKE MEATLOAF, RIGHT? 
YEAH.                           

134
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:25,991
    WE MIX THIS AND THE BUFFALO 
    BY HAND EVERY DAY.          

135
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,925
SO IF YOU MIXED THE BUFFALO     
AND THE VENISON,                

136
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:30,329
YOU COULD HAVE A BUFFISON?      

137
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:32,330
        THAT'S A GOOD ONE, GUY. 

138
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:34,199
MY GOD, HONEY, DID YOU SEE HIM

DOWN THE STREET?                

139
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,134
       IT'S 6 OUNCES THIS TIME. 

140
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:39,271
YOU GO FIRST, WHOEVER IS        
CLOSEST WITHOUT GOING OVER.     
                           WHOA!

141
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:42,073
OKAY, OKAY, GOOD,               
THERE'S ONE...                  

142
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:44,476
           HEY, WHAT CAN I SAY, 
           THE MAN'S A WINNER.  

143

NOW CAN I PRESS ONE OUT,        
READY TO FIRE.                  
              FIRE IN THE HOLE. 

144
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:49,414
BEAUTIFUL, NOW WHAT DO          
WE SERVE THESE WITH?            

145
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,283

       AND BACON.               

146
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,952
         IS THAT GOOD WITH YOU? 
YEAH, LET'S GO,                 
FEEL THE PAIN!

     AND SOME PEPPERCORN RANCH. 

150
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:03,828
     LOOK AT THAT, THAT'S A     
     GOURMET BURGER RIGHT THERE.

151
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,764
   I'M GONNA TELL YOU SOMETHIN'.

152
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,899
              I WOULD COME BACK 
               FOR THAT BURGER. 
WELL, THANK YOU, MAN.           

153
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:09,701
THAT'S THE GO-TO BURGER         
FOR ME.                         

154
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,103
THE BACON'S GREAT,              
THE PEPPERCORN RANCH            
IS ON POINT,                    

155
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,773
BUT THE TEXTURE AND THE FLAVOR  
OF VENISON,                     

156
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:17,309
              THAT'S MY BURGER. 
APPRECIATE IT, BROTHER.

                     GREAT JOB. 
APPRECIATE IT.                  

158
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:21,312
THAT'S PROBABLY THE BEST PIECE  
OF VENISON I EVER HAD,          
AND IT'S IN A BURGER.           

159
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:23,248
IT'S THE BEST BURGER            
AROUND HERE TOTALLY.            

160
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,385
   IT'S SO AWESOME,             
   THEY HAVE THE BEST BURGERS.  

161
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,754
   IT'S A GREAT PLACE           
   WITH A GOOD SENSE OF HUMOR.  

162
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:33,124
IT ALWAYS SOUNDS LIKE           
A LITTLE PARTY.                 

163
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:34,926
DO YOU GUYS PARTY HERE?         

164
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,862

166
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:44,336

00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:47,939
             (Guy)              
WE'RE GOING TO THE NORTHWEST... 
  BEST CHILI IN TOWN BY FAR.    

168
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,941

         AND A WHOLE LOT MORE.  

170

     TO MAC IT OUT RIGHT THERE, 
     MMM, EXCELLENT!            

171
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,950
       I'M HERE IN SEATTLE      
       WHERE MOST PEOPLE        

172
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:01,887
   THINK ABOUT GREAT COFFEE     
   AND THAT CRAZY FISH MARKET.  

173
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:05,557
  BUT ME, I THINK ABOUT         
  SEATTLE'S LIKE A CHILI-VILLE. 

174
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,293
       NOW I WENT TO            
       MIKE'S CHILI PARLOR      
       AND HAD A BLAST,         

175
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:10,962
     BUT I'M IN SEARCH

THE PORK IS GREAT,              

179
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:24,242
THE GREEN SAUCE                 
ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL.           
 IT HAS A LOT OF TASTE TO IT.   

180
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,177
 (Guy)                          
 A SOUTHWESTERN FAVORITE        

181

 TO DO HIM A ROADHOUSE,         

187
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:40,725
 A JUKE JOINT KINDA OF PLACE.   

188
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:42,660
CHILI JUST SEEMED               
TO BE THE ANSWER.               

189
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:45,530
             (Guy)              
          BUT IT WAS            
  A MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTION.   
                   CHILI VERDE. 

190
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,533

THIS WOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH       
RIGHT HERE THE WAY IT IS.       

235
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,910

A LITTLE SEASONING SALT,        
YOU MAKE IT YOURSELF?           
              ABSOLUTELY, YEAH. 

238
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,784
              THERE YOU GO.     

239
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:48,653
MEXICAN OREGANO, A LITTLE CUMIN,
BLACK PEPPER, CORIANDER.        

240
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:50,588
    YOU GOT IT, GIVE IT A STIR. 

241
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,324
 ALL RIGHT, NOW WE'VE GOTTA     
 ADD A QUICK MASA ROUX TO THAT, 

242
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,660
     CANOLA OLIVE OIL BLEND,    
     THAT CORN MASA FLOUR.      

243
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:59,664
OKAY, THAT THEY MAKE            
TORTILLAS OUT OF, LOOK AT THAT. 
        YEAH, STIR IT RIGHT IN. 

244
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,066
       IT TIGHTENS IT UP AND IT 
       GIVES IT KIND OF A NICE  
       LITTLE TORTILLA FLAVOR.  

245
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:04,001
I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT.           

246
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:06,871
OKAY, SO TURN THE HEAT DOWN,    
LET IT GO LOW AND SLOW          
FOR 1 1/2 HOURS.                

247
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:08,673

              AS YOU'LL FIND,   
              NOT OVERLY SALTY. 

250
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:18,283
 JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE SEE        
 IT'S GREEN, I THINK THEY THINK 
 IT'S GONNA BE HOT              

251
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:20,285
  WHEN YOU SAY CHILI, IT'S NOT. 

252
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,887
   AND THE KILLER APP           
   IS PILIN' IT ON              
   THE JALAPENO MAC AND CHEESE. 

253
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:26,424
     ALL RIGHT, EXCELLENT,      
     THAT'S THE WAY             
     TO MAC IT OUT RIGHT THERE.

          OF PEPPER HEAT.       

255
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:30,228
    THEN YOU GET SOME OF THE    
    SMOKINESS OF THE PORK BUTT, 

256
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,630
         A LITTLE BIT OF CRUNCH 
         FROM THE TOPPING.      

257
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,432
    PUTTIN' THESE TWO TOGETHER, 
    THAT'S THE WAY I WOULD      

258
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:37,435

             WHATEVER YOU WANT.

SEVERAL WAYS TO TOP IT, YEAH.   

263
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,913
    I GET TORTILLA STRIPS,      
    SO IT'S KINDA LIKE NACHOS   
    AT THE SAME TIME.           

264

THE WAY YOU WANT,               

266

              AND THEY BRING IT 
               HOW YOU WANT IT. 
YEP.                            

267
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:56,987

        CHEDDAR GRITS.

270
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:05,129
 (Guy)                          
 BUT FOR THE CHILI PURIST,      
 IT'S A BASIC BOWL OF BASIC RED.

271
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,065
      SAUCE AND MEAT,           
      THAT'S WHAT CHILI IS.     

272
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:11,069
         WHAT'S THE FIRST STEP?

THEN WHAT HAPPENS?              

278
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:25,550
  I'M GONNA PULL THESE OUT,     
  GET THE MEAT AND ADD THAT IN. 

279
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,752

00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,322
A LITTLE BIT OF SUGAR           
COMING IN FROM THAT.            

296
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,324
         IT'S A LITTLE SWEET,   
         ADD A LITTLE MORE BEER 
         INTO THAT.             

297
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:10,261
AND THAT WILL TAKE US           
TO TEXAS RED CHILI?             
                    JUST ABOUT. 

298
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,197
HE ALWAYS HAS                   
JUST THAT EXTRA LITTLE PIECE.   

299
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,065
             AS THIS COOKS DOWN 
             A LITTLE BIT,      

300
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:17,135
       GET THAT RED CHILI OIL   
       AND MAKE SOME MASA ROUX, 

301
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:18,937
    SPREAD IT OUT A LITTLE BIT. 

302
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,938
YOU WANT ME TO TASTE THAT       
A WHOLE BUNCH OF TIMES?         

303
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:22,941
PROBABLY WAIT ABOUT 1 1/2 HOURS 
'TIL IT'S READY TO GO.          

304
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,009
                     TEXAS RED. 

305
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:27,011

               GOT IT GOIN' ON, 

308
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:33,751
AND I GET THE MASA,             
TASTE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT CORN.

309
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:35,687
                        DIG IT. 

310
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:37,955
THE SPICES ARE PERFECT.         

311
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:41,091

                OF SWEET TO IT. 
      TURKEY WITH WORKS,        
      BRISKET AND BEANS.        

312
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:43,027
      BEST CHILI I'VE EVER HAD  
      IN MY LIFE.               

313

      IN THERE.

316
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,036
MY FAVORITE.

   A GREAT TRIPLE D HISTORY.    

324
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:13,925

 SINCE HE WAS 13 YEARS OLD.     

328
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:23,935

     FATHER AND SON MACHINE.

      RUN BY DENNIS PIAZZA      
      AND HIS SON JUSTIN,

00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:43,688
  A COUPLE OF JERSEY GUYS...    
      WHAT A WAY TO EAT!        

337
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,490
  (Guy)                         
  WHO BROUGHT THEIR HOME COOKIN'
  TRADITIONS WITH THEM          

338
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,558
      WHEN THEIR FAMILY         
      MOVED TO ARIZONA.         

339
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:49,493
    THEN THEY OPENED THIS JOINT.

340
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,362
               LIFE'S TOO SHORT 
               TO EAT BAD FOOD. 

341
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,431
WE USE FRESH MOZZARELLA,        
WE MAKE OUR OWN DOUGH,          
WE MAKE OUR OWN SAUCES.         

342
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,900
       IT'S JUST AWESOME.       

343
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,902
                      HANDMADE. 
  REALLY GOOD FRESH TOPPINGS.

ENJOY.                          
             (Guy)              
     ON ALL KINDS OF PIES.      

345
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:01,773
     MARGHERITA PIZZA,          
     IT'S OUT OF THIS WORLD.    

346
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:03,774
     THEIR WHITE PIZZAS         
     ARE PHENOMENAL.            

347
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,244
             (Guy)              
        AND THIS ONE'S          
      JUST BEEN INVENTED.       
           MEDITERRANEAN PIZZA. 

348
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:09,246
       (Guy)                    
       WITH PESTO ALFREDO SAUCE,
       MOZZARELLA,              
       AND SUN DRIED TOMATOES.  

349
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:11,115
             OKAY, LET'S MAKE   
             THE MEDITERRANEAN. 

350
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:13,050
          LET'S DO IT.          

351
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:15,920
WHEAT FLOUR FROM ITALY,         
THAT'S WHAT THE KEY             
TO OUR RECIPE IS.               

352
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,389
SO I TURN THE MIXER ON,         
PUT IN LUKEWARM WATER.          

353
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:20,925
ACTIVATE THE YEAST,             
LET IT SIT FOR A SECOND.        

354
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,727
SUGAR, SALT...                  

355
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,728
            LET THAT MIX EVENLY 
            THROUGH THERE.      

356
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:26,730
THEN I POUR THE YEAST IN,       
NOW THE WATER.                  

357
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:28,599
EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL.         

358
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:30,602
AND THEN LET IT MIX USUALLY     
ABOUT 10 TO 15 MINUTES.         

359
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:32,937
       I LEAVE IT IN A BIG BALL 
       ON THE TABLE,            

360
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:34,739
   THROW A PLASTIC BAG ON IT,   
   LET IT SIT,                  

361
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,740
     LET IT SWEAT A LITTLE BIT. 

362
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:39,810
SO NOW WE'RE READY              
TO UNVEIL THE MASTERPIECE       

363
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:41,946
AND START TRIMMIN' IT DOWN?     

364
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,615
TWELVE OUNCES,                  
USUALLY GET IT ON PRETTY CLOSE. 

365
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:48,152
ELEVEN AND A HALF,              
LET ME GET A SHOT AT THIS.      

366
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:51,622
       BEAT ME AT MY OWN PLACE, 
                 IT'S NOT COOL. 
AH-HA!                          

367
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,691
     YOU'RE ON THE MONEY TODAY. 

368
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,960
OKAY, SO THEN YOU'RE GONNA      
ROLL BACK IN.                   
                  I ROLL IT IN. 

369
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:57,895
MAKE A NICE CLEAN BALL.         

370
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:59,697
      A LITTLE OIL              
      IN THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN. 

371
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,766
         PUT IT DOWN,           
         TURN IT THE OTHER WAY. 

372
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:03,701
        MAKE SURE BOTH SIDES    
        GET A LITTLE OIL ON IT. 

373
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:06,971
   FLOUR IT UP, STRETCH IT OUT, 
   AND THEN JUST GIVE IT        
   A LITTLE TWIRL.              

374
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:08,773
   THERE YOU GO, NICE AND SOFT, 
   NICE AND THIN.               

375
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,242
FRESH MOZZARELLA GOES ON FIRST. 

376
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:13,177
        IT'S GOT HOMEMADE PESTO 
        ALFREDO SAUCE.          

377
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:15,312
   WE'LL PUT THE PESTO IN THERE 
   AND WHIP THAT UP.            

378
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,181
        THAT'S THE SAUCE        
        THAT GOES ON THE PIZZA. 

379
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,250
    I WILL ADD A LITTLE BIT     
    OF THE SHREDDED MOZZARELLA. 

380
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:22,720
          A LITTLE OLIVE OIL    
          ON THIS ONE,          
          OREGANO, IN THE OVEN. 

381
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:24,722
WATCH IT, MAKE SURE             
THIS COOKS REAL GOOD HERE.      

382
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:26,591
LOOK AT THAT.                   

383
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:29,126
JUST GONNA TAKE IT OUT HERE,    
SUN DRIED TOMATOES GO ON,       

384
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:31,062
JUST GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT       
MORE...                         

385
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:34,065
          CHEESE BOILING ON TOP 
          OF THE PIZZA SKIN.    

386
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:35,967
FRESH FETA                      
AND WE'RE READY TO GO.          

387
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:42,206
MMM, THAT'S GREAT, REALLY GOOD, 
LOOK HOW THIN THAT IS.          

388
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,008
                THAT'S AMAZING. 

389
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,077
      I LIKE PIZZA CRUST        
      THAT HAS SOME BITE TO IT. 

390
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,212
            IF YOU GOTTA CHEW,  
            YOU GOTTA ENJOY IT. 

391
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,281
           THAT'S SOME REALLY   
           FLAVORFUL PESTO TOO. 

392
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:53,617
  I CAN DO AN ITSY-BITSY SPIDER 
  WITH THE MOZZARELLA CHEESE.   

393
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:57,288
    SO SIMPLE BUT WHEN          
    YOU USED GREAT INGREDIENTS, 
    SO GOOD.                    

394
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:59,824
THIS IS THE REAL DEAL,          
I WON'T EAT PIZZA ANYWHERE ELSE.

395
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:02,360
      YOU CAN TELL              
      THAT IT'S FRESH MADE      

396
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:05,095
    AND THAT HE PUTS A LOT      
  OF HEART AND SOUL INTO IT.    
         THERE YOU GO.          

397
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,897
IT'S AN ART, FROM THE DOUGH     
TO THE SAUCE TO THE CHEESE      
AND HOW YOU PUT IT TOGETHER.    

398
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,901
           HE'S ONE OF THE BEST 
                   YOU'VE SEEN? 
HE'S THE BEST I KNOW OF.        

399
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:11,836
               CAN I SAVE THAT? 
HE'S THE BEST I KNOW OF.        

400
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:14,972
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK           
I'LL EVER HEAR THAT EVER AGAIN. 

401
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:17,241
  (Guy)                         
  BUT HEY, HE HAS BEEN DOING IT 
  SINCE HE WAS A KID.           

402
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:19,176
         ANOTHER ONE COMING IN. 

403
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:21,179
     IT'S NOT LIKE ANY OTHER    
     PIZZA PLACE.               

404
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:23,114
 THIS RECIPE'S BEEN PASSED DOWN,
 THIS ISN'T YOUR                
 AVERAGE PIZZA SAUCE.           

405
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:25,049
       (Guy)                    
       AND THESE AREN'T         
       YOUR AVERAGE PIES.

00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:28,919

          IMPORTED SALAMI.      

413
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:45,135
DOES THAT DOOR STAY LOCKED      
RIGHT OVER THERE                
THE WHOLE TIME?                 

414
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:48,072
  LOOK AT THIS GUY,             
  HE'S SABOTAGING MY PIES HERE. 

415
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:51,141
   NOW WE GOT PARMA PROSCIUTTO, 
   ALMOST GIVES IT              

416
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,477
 LIKE A BACON-TYPE EFFECT       
 WHEN IT COMES OUT OF THE OVEN. 

417
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:55,412
        ITALIAN SAUSAGE.        

418

00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:03,621
THAT'LL GIVE IT THE LITTLE KISS,
SEPARATE IT.                    

421
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:07,492
      NOW HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE 
                AT 800 DEGREES? 
FOUR MINUTES.                   

422
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:09,427
    YOU CAN JUST SEE EVERYTHING 
    STARTIN' TO CURL UP ON TOP  
    IN THERE.

           SO MUCH MEAT ON IT,  

427
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,640

                AND SO CRUNCHY,

  YOU CAN TASTE THE PEPPERONI,  

432
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:34,051
   SEPARATE FROM THE SAUSAGE,   
   FROM THE PROSCIUTTO.         

433
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,187
 IT'S JUST GOOD,                
 EVERYTHING ON THE MENU'S GOOD, 
 PLUS IT'S HOME.

00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,924
      (Guy)

            A ROSY COLOR TO IT.

FRESH MOZZARELLA.               

480
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:34,071

BECAUSE WHEN I GO ON THE        
OTHER ONE,                      

481
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:36,740
I DON'T WANT IT TO BECOME MUSH. 
             OOH, LOOK AT THAT! 

482
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:38,676
THE SHOW'S CALLED               
"DINERS, DRIVE-INS, AND DIVES." 

483
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:40,745
   I TRAVEL AROUND THE COUNTRY, 
   AND I WATCH OTHER PEOPLE     
   COOK IN THEIR RESTAURANT.    

484
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,147
RIGHT, WELL,                    
I LIKE HOW YOU COOK.
