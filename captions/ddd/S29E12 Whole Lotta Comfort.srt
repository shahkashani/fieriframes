This is elevated barbecue.

349
00:11:41,506 --> 00:11:42,840
Especially
with the pork collar.

350
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,573
I mean, that's just
drivin' it for me.

Smoked tomato.

352
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:47,373
So, that smaller pit
that you saw?

353
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,940
That takes most
of our vegetables.

354

‐Hang on. Time out.
‐Barbecue sauce...

355
00:11:51,173 --> 00:11:52,340
'Cause we have a whole smoker
dedicated to vegetables.

356
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,773
It's for vegetables.

357
00:11:53,773 --> 00:11:54,940
This is far beyond
what you'd expect to get

358
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,673

That's legit.

Two times.

It's something you just can't
find anywhere else.

00:12:07,646 --> 00:12:09,713
So, you don't have
a brick and mortar,

367
00:12:09,713 --> 00:12:13,046
but what you chose to do
is take a bunch of food trucks,

368
00:12:13,046 --> 00:12:14,913

a little village...

369

Seal it up.

We'll hit these
with our dry rub again.

What of the 75 smokers out there
are you gonna put it on?

Maynard.

404
00:13:15,053 --> 00:13:17,686
Each barbecue pit is named after
my favorite band's lead singer.

405

Oh, no kidding?

406

So, we have "Maynard" after
the Tool lead singer...

407

Cornell, Cobain, and Chino,
the singer from the Deftones.

That's awesome. How long does
it go on the smoker?

About 30 minutes each side.

with the hot‐mayo mustard.

I don't know if the burger
is big enough.

Wow. Just the right amount

the creamy ambassador.

It's a little bit spicy,
