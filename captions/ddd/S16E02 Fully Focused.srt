                   A RUB FIRST. 

105
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:55,627
    WE START WITH MINCED GARLIC,
           CRACKED PEPPER,      

106
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,562
          SUGAR, FRESH ROSEMARY,

107
00:04:57,564 --> 00:05:00,498
                   FRESH SAGE...
A BUNCH OF SALT.                

108
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,167
                          AND...
A LITTLE PINK                   
  HAIR DYE.                     

109
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,469
                PINK SALT,      
          AND I BLEND IT ALL UP.

110
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,107
MMM!                            
             NOW WE'RE GONNA    
        PUT THE RUB ON THE DUCK.

111
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:11,843
 HOW LONG ARE YOU               
GONNA LET THIS GO?              
                     SEVEN DAYS.

112
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,712
  ALL RIGHT, SO WE'RE CURING    
THIS DUCK IS WHAT WE'RE DOING.  

113
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,613
BUT WE'RE REALLY GONNA BE       
PULLING THE MOISTURE OUT,       

114
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:17,716
WHICH IS GONNA BE GREAT,        
BECAUSE THAT LENDS ITSELF       

115
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:19,718
 TO WHEN YOU SMOKE IT THAT      
IT'S GONNA GIVE IT A CHANCE     

116
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,455
TO REALLY TIGHTEN UP AND BE NICE
AND FIRM TO MAKE BACON, CORRECT?
                 THAT'S CORRECT.

117
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:27,659
OKAY, DUCK'S SET TO GO.         

118
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,394
SMOKER'S READY?                 
                 SMOKER'S READY.

119
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:30,995
SKIN SIDE UP?                   

120
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,398
                            YEP.

121
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,667
 SO THAT'S GONNA GO             
AN HOUR AND A HALF...           
                HOUR AND A HALF.

122
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,002
LUMP CHARCOAL AND A LITTLE BIT  
        OF APPLEWOOD.           
                            YEP.

123
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,405
                 NOW THAT       
         THE DUCK BREAST IS OFF,

124
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:42,273
                WE MAKE A LITTLE
               POMEGRANATE SYRUP

125
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:45,744
                JUST TO ADD     
           A LITTLE MORE FLAVOR.
OKAY.                           

126
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:47,679
                NOW WE'RE GONNA 
               SLICE THIS BACON.

127
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,615
                      VERY THIN.
NICE AND THIN SO IT WILL        
 CRISP UP A LITTLE BIT.         

128
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:53,485
                             ♪♪ 

129
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:58,223
THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE          
     SACRILEGIOUS               

130
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:00,225
TO EVEN PUT THAT                
ON ANYTHING ELSE.               

131
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:02,427
             WELL, LET'S SEE IT.

132
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,429

           A LITTLE BIT--       

138
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,714
YOU KNOW WHY THEY CALL IT       
      HUMBOLT FOG?              
                UM, NO, I DON'T.

139
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,050
              I KNOW IT'S FOGGY.
DO YOU SEE HOW--DO YOU SEE      
HOW I JUST DISTRACTED YOU       

140
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,252
WHILE I ATE THAT OTHER PIECE    
        OF THAT DUCK            

141
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,720

          SO SLY.               

142
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,124
             WHY DO THEY CALL IT
                 HUMBOLT FOG?   

143
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:33,925
  HUMBOLT IS ONE OF THE MOST    
BEAUTIFUL PLACES IN THE WORLD,  

144
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:36,061
BUT THE CRAZY THING IS          
 IS WE DO GET, LIKE,            

145
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,196
THIS ABUNDANCE--                
ABOUT AS MUCH FOG               

146
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:41,933

 IS THE KIND OF FOG WE GET.     

147
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,802
                  NOW OUR SMOKED
                    DUCK BACON. 

148
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,740
 IN THE OVEN                    
FOR HOW LONG?                   
                     12 MINUTES.

149
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,209
     AND THEN WE'RE GONNA       
FINISH IT IN THE SALAMANDER...  
              IN THE SALAMANDER.

150
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:53,878
JUST TO PUT A NICE LITTLE CRISP 
ON THAT--ON THAT BACON ON TOP.  
                   THAT'S RIGHT.

151
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,547
WHOO! GOT IT?                   

152
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:58,483
                 YEAH, I GOT IT.
  THAT'S THE FINAL              
LITTLE CRISP ON THAT.           

153
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:01,019
        NOW WE PUT A LITTLE MORE
        POMEGRANATE SYRUP ON IT.
OF COURSE WE DO.                

154
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:03,922
        A LITTLE CRACKED PEPPER.
BASIL, PARSLEY.                 

155
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:11,596
     THE CRUST ON THIS FLATBREAD
            IS RIGHTEOUS.       

156
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:17,035
                SO THE BREAD HAS
                SUCH GREAT CHEW.

157
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:20,304
             THE FRESH MOZZ,    
        TARTNESS OF THAT CHERRY,

158
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:22,374

159
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:23,975
                COMING FROM THAT
                  HUMBOLT FOG.  

160
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:27,779
      NOBODY TAKES THE LEAD ROLE
        EXCEPT THE DUCK BACON.  

161
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:32,517
   IT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST
     DUCK DISHES I'VE EVER HAD. 

162
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:35,786

IT'S CALLED RIGGIES?

                THESE PARTS,

OKAY, LET'S START               
  THE RIGGIES.                  

187
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,386
             FIRST, WE'RE GONNA 
           START WITH OLIVE OIL,

188
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:43,854
            GARLIC, SWEET ONION,

           SIMMER FOR A MOMENT. 

190
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:49,461
     THEN WE GO TO OUR PEPPERS--
      YELLOW PEPPERS, SWEET RED,

191
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:51,862
       GREEN, A LITTLE JALAPEÑO.

192
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:55,733
 SO THIS HAS GOT                
SOME SPICE TO IT?               
       WELL, WE CALL IT "WICKED"
        FOR A REASON, YOU KNOW?

00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:23,333
  WE'RE GONNA GO RIGHT INTO     
ROLLING IT IN THE CHEESECLOTH.  
             IN THE CHEESECLOTH,
                   GOT IT.      

405
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:25,937

406
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:29,473
     THIS IS WHERE              
IT GETS A LITTLE MESSY.         

407
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:32,343
             TIGHTEN IT UP,     
       STARTING TO PRESS IT OUT.

408
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:34,411
IF YOU WANT TO TIE THAT OFF,    
 I'D GREATLY APPRECIATE IT.     

409
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,681
WE'LL POACH IT.                 

410
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:39,883
   IT'S JUST WATER,             
SALT, GRANULATED SUGAR.

          THAT'S IT--90 SECONDS?

415
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:50,561
THAT'S IT.                      
                JUST ENOUGH     
          TO HEAT UP ALL THE FAT

416
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,697
             SO IT'LL CONGEAL   
          BACK TOGETHER TIGHT...
CORRECT.                        

417
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:55,833
ONCE YOU DROP IT INTO THE WATER.
    OKAY, SO 90 SECONDS OUT,    

418
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:57,701
                          AND...
SHOCK IT IN AN ICE BATH.        

419
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:00,971
    LET THIS SIT 10, 15 MINUTES,
      TILL IT REALLY CONGEALS.  
YEP.                            

420
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:05,242
             THEN WE'LL TAKE IT,
                  REWRAP IT?    
REWRAP IT.

425
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,857
