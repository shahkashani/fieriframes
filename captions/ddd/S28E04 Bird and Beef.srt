00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:38,056
     and tell me, how leg--     
   -Do I get to drive the car?  

230
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:39,591
            After we eat, David!

231
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:41,125
         Are you hungry?        
           -Heck yeah!          

232
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,261
     This is One90 Smoked Meats.

  Chili mac coming.             

234
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,135
  This is the best              
barbecue place of all.          

235
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,736
              MAN:              
 Three meat plate in the window.

236
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:53,004
   I'm, like, crazy about it.   

237
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:54,138
              MAN:              
        Hot ham working.        

238
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,340
   These guys seem to have it   
        all nailed down.        

239
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,810
             FIERI:             
   That's 'cause Herman Guerra  
       and Kyle St. Clair       

240
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,679
      worked out the kinks      
       in their backyards       

241
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:03,014
      till they were ready      
     to quit their day jobs.    

242
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:05,483
I worked for a Federal judge,   
did a law clerkship.            

243
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,619
 And then you just thought you'd
     trade that in for a smoker?

244
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:09,020
        Yeah.                   

245
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:11,356
     That smoke makes you crazy,
       present company included.

246
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:13,424
      MAN: Chopping brisket     
     for the Spicy Brisket.     

247
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,426
         I'm having the         
     Spicy Brisket sandwich.    

248
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,295
   MAN: You get a nice element  
          of the smoke,         

249
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:19,965
     you get the true flavor    
     of the actual brisket.     

250
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,033
        All right, so let's talk
        about the brisket first.

251
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,568
ST. CLAIR: We don't pull        
  all the fat off.              

252
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,238
Fat is where a lot of flavor is,
and so what we're gonna do      

253
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,573
is just season our brisket      
with salt and pepper.           

254
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:29,708
                Look at that.   

255
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,175
               It's a flick of  
              the wrist, David. 

256
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,977
           -Stunning.           
 -Squirt bottle with the pepper,

257
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,846
that gives it a nice,           
  even shot at it.              

258
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,048
           It definitely gets to
             the perfume of it. 

259
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,316
        -In the smoker --       
           -Six hours.          

260
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:39,384
             We'll bring it out,
               we'll wrap it,   

261
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:40,585
       and then we'll finish it,
                    4-6?        

262
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:41,786
        4-6.                    

263
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,521
We're gonna make our            
Spicy Barbecue sauce.           

264
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,723
           -All right.          
     -Start with a little --    

265
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:46,458
A little bit of the drip        
  from the brisket.             

266
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,527
    Tomato sauce,               
do a little bit of ketchup.     

267
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,127
              Are you a ketchup 
             barbecue sauce guy?

268
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,329
There's so many different kinds.

269
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:52,663
  Sometimes yes, sometimes no.  

270
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:53,932
                    Okay.       
              No, I'm with you. 

271
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:56,801
Vinegar, a little liquid smoke, 
  chipotle peppers,             

272
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:58,469
onion powder, garlic salt.      

273
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,804
    Anything scaring you so far?

274
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:00,872
            Not yet.            
           He's good.           

275
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,206
              He's watching you 
              with a close eye. 

276
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,075
        -I'm watching it.       
        -Creole mustard.        

277
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,276
            Got to have a little
              mustard in there. 

278
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,210
       Now we're cooking.       

279
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,079
Add some Worcestershire,        
      molasses.                 

280
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:09,614
     Ooh, that's your sweet.    

281
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:12,017
A little black pepper,          
     some honey.                

282
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:13,551
                   Garlic.      

283
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,687
                 Hey, sugar.    

284
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:16,955
          -Settle down.         
          -It's great.          

285
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:18,890
             I get to use all my
          old material on David.

286
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,424
            It's like new stuff.

287
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:23,962
Now, we're gonna let that cook  
normally for about an hour.     

288
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:25,563
          -Good sauce.          
    -Let's get some brisket.    

289
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,365
             You don't even need
             a knife with that. 

290
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:28,633
              You can cut that  
              with a bad look.  

291
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,902
       -That's beautiful.       
  -Give it a little pull test.  

292
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,505
  Don't tell me I didn't get you
anything nice for your birthday.

293
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:34,639
              Mmm.              

294
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,975
         That would make        
    a bulldog bite his chain.   

295
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,577
             I knew one of those
                 was coming.    

296
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:39,644
             That's good pepper.

297
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:41,779
            Nice unctuous fat --
                 just melts.    

298
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,181
Now, do you serve sliced plates?

299
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,383
We serve it by the pound,       
we serve it on plates --        

300
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:48,053
                 On plates?     

301
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:49,788
            Well, you don't say.

302
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,990
What do you say we put          
a sandwich together?            

303
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:53,324
          -Let's do it.         
           -Let's go.           

304
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,694
 So, we're gonna get            
our roasted poblano pepper,     

305
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:58,396
drop on our in-house            
smoked cheddar cheese...        

306
00:09:58,398 --> 00:09:59,464
       Now we're cooking.       

307
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,666
...then we get our meat on,     
 the brioche bun...             

308
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,001
      The bun is beautiful.     

309
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:06,471
          -Yes, it is.          
     -...get a little sauce.    

310
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:07,938
    Get a little                
  of the red onion.             

311
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,743
       A full serving of pickle.

312
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:14,012
         -There you go.         
             -Whoa.             

313
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:16,214
                Look at that.   

314
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,817
            -Mm-hmm.            
       -What do you think?      

315
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:21,886
    So, the barbecue, of course,
               reigns supreme.  

316
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:25,223
            -Awesome.           
 -The brisket's not overcooked. 

317
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,892
   It's smoked the right amount,
               good seasoning.  

318
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:29,761
           By itself, delicious.

319
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:31,696
              But what you did  
       inside of the sandwich --

320
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:32,964
                 the poblano    
             and the pickles -- 

321
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:36,101
            the acid, the onion,
      smoked cheddar's dynamite.

322
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:37,635
             You're really going
             to the next level. 

323
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,571
         You these layer        
     after layer of flavor.     

324
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,240
        It's kind of like       
        a party going on.       

325
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:43,641
              You're coming to  
             the barbecue judge,

326
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,376
        and you just made a real
         good case for yourself.

327
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,312
                 It's true.     

328
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:48,780
  Brisket Sandwich.             

329
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:52,717
   It's lean and tender, rich   
  from the fat, not too fatty.  

330
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:55,386
  WOMAN: Poblano and the cheese 
    all mixed out together --   

331
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,721
     They make it delicious.    

332
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:58,122
              MAN:              
  Here comes your Philly, boy.  

333
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,323
    It's a small restaurant.    

334
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,858
 They have a small seating area.

335
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,727
      It's mostly take-out.     

336
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:05,764
  We like to bring their meats  
    to cook for our cook-out.   

337
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,865
       You can grab a lot       
      of different options.     

338
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:11,002
  We've done bison,             
we make salmon, ducks.          

339
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,605
             -Duck?             
             -Duck.             

340
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:15,740
                    Gosh!

 toasted coriander,

crushed chili flakes,           

458

a slice of jalapeño,            

459
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:54,492
  a little salt --              
a lot of salt, actually.

467
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,372

          and brine the chicken,

468
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:09,641
       and how long are we gonna
             brine the chicken? 

469
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:11,109
     Four hours.                

470
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:13,444
                 All right.     
   Flouring's got to take place.

471
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:15,780
First part of that is we got to 
make our house seasoning blend. 

472
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:17,247
                    Okay.       

473
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,651
So we got some chili powder,    
some cayenne, toasted coriander,

474
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:24,055
onion powder, garlic powder,    
black pepper, and salt.         

475
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:25,123

476
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,457
So then that goes into          
   our rice flour.              

477
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:27,926
 So we call this our            
   "First flour."               

478
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:29,793
                First flour.    
So there's a lot of flour power.

479
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,395

  flour overnight.              

483

                Soaks it up.    

484
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,803
This starts to develop          
 that crust for us.             

485
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,404
All right, so we got            
that chicken that sat overnight 

486
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:41,606
       in the first flour.      
        -Got it, got it.        

487
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,074

488
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,410
                    Okay.       

489

coated up real good --          

492
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:53,751
and then on these towers        

493
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:55,553
we got the fatter part          
of the breast on the outside,   

494
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,355
 then we do the two             
thighs on the corners,          

495
00:15:57,357 --> 00:16:00,024
and this heating element        
is around this way of the fryer.

496
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:01,492
That part's gonna cook          
  a little faster.              

497
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:02,760
                    Okay.       

498
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:03,894
And then the drumsticks         
and the wings are the smallest, 

499
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,229
  so they get piled             
   in the middle.

00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,766
And then this gets put          
in this rack like this.         

502
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:09,901

503
00:16:09,903 --> 00:16:11,769
We cook it 15 minutes           
   at 300 degrees,              

504
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,571
 and that builds up             
the crust really nice.          

505
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:16,173

576

         -Chicken skins?

We're gonna lay these raw

...put these in the oven

dry them out so when we fry them

585
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,216

00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,152

-And what do we serve this with?

587
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:43,020
 We serve this with             
a pinto bean hummus.            

588
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:45,022

               I was thinking.  

589
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:46,624
       The first thing that came
               to my mind is,   

590
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,227
          "Why not make a hummus
        but out of pinto beans?"

591
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:50,227
        Yeah.                   

592
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,828
So, we got some rinsed          
    pinto beans.                

593
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,231
  We call this our              
   "Garlic mojo."               

594
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:56,233
It's roasted garlic with        
scallion and fresh thyme...     

595
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:57,301
