THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE.

  YOU HAVE EVERYBODY SITTING    
AROUND A TABLE EATING CRAWFISH. 

106
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:48,353

                 CRACK THE TAIL 
               AND BREAK IT OFF.

109
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:55,427
            YOU CAN DRINK A BEER
            AND GET ANOTHER ONE.

110
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:57,562
SO LET'S GET STARTED.           

111
00:04:57,564 --> 00:05:00,365
WE GOT A BIG POT OF HOT WATER.  
    YOU'LL SALT IT FIRST.

00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:04,302
OKAY.                           
       I'M GONNA PUT IN TWO BAGS
             OF ZATARAIN'S.     

113

114
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,707
A LOT OF IT.                    
 (whistles)                     

115

               LOLA'S TRASH POT.

117
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:16,381
BUT THE CELERY AND THE ONIONS   
       AND THE LEMONS           

118
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:18,516
ARE JUST FOR THE FLAVOR         
     PIECE OF IT.               
                     ALL FLAVOR.

119
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,785
YOU'RE NOT PUTTING THAT OUT     
ON THE TRAY AND EATING IT.      

120
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,854

NOW WE GO WITH                  
SOME BABY REDS.                 

121
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:25,123
      WE'RE GONNA PUT IN BUTTER.
  SO THE FAT--                  
THE OIL IN THERE

COME OFF EASIER                 
ON THE CRAWFISH.                
                            YES.

124
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:31,396
LET THIS SIMMER FOR WHAT,       
   ANOTHER 20 MINUTES?          
               ABOUT 20 MINUTES.

125
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:33,498
WHAT'S UP NEXT?                 
                       CRAWFISH.

126
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,634
ANGRY LITTLE ONE,               
      HUH?                      
                            YEP.

127
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:40,138
HOW MANY POUNDS                 
   WAS THIS?                    
                   THIS IS ABOUT
                   5 1/2 POUNDS.

128
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,540
AND THIS WILL FEED              
 HOW MANY FOLKS?                
                             ME.

129
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,009
AND YOU CAN REALLY EAT          
  5 POUNDS OF THIS?             
                      EVERY DAY.

130
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,612
NOW HOW LONG ARE THE CRAWFISH   
       GONNA COOK FOR?          
            ABOUT EIGHT MINUTES.

131
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:50,482
SO WHEN DO WE PUT               
  THE CORN IN?                  
           RIGHT BEFORE YOU PULL
               YOUR CRAWFISH,   

132
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:52,817
               YOU LIKE TO FLOAT
                   YOUR CORN.   
  AND WHO'D YOU                 
LEARN THIS FROM?                

133
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,487
          MY MOM AND DAD DID IT,
               MY BROTHERS.     

134
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:57,489
       WE USED TO GO CRAWFISHING
      ALL THE TIME. WE'RE READY.

135
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:59,957
   DO I HAVE TO PUT 'EM ON THERE
        WHILE IT'S SPINNING?    

136
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,894
  WHILE IT'S SPINNING--         
THAT'LL BE THE FUN OF IT.       

137
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,963
YOU COULD EAT ALL THIS?         
           YES. NOT ALL THE CORN
               AND POTATOES,    

138
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:07,965
                BUT EVERY SINGLE
                    CRAWFISH.   
OH.                             

139
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:11,102
  NOW I'M GONNA JUST TOP IT OFF 
 WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SEASONING.

140
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,171
              YOU WANT A LESSON?
I KNOW THE TWIST                
    AND POP.

          YOU DID--THIS IS NICE.

144
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,780
    I MEAN, I WOULDN'T SAY THIS 
   IS A MILD BOWL, BY ANY MEANS.

145
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:23,915
                   CRAWFISH ARE 
                 REALLY BUTTERY.

146
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,851
      I JUST MEAN IN THE SENSE  
   THAT THEY'RE NICE AND TENDER.

147
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:28,853
           MMM. WOW. YOU THINK  
         THAT TAIL MEAT'S SWEET,

148
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,855
                THAT CLAW MEAT'S
                 OUT-OF-BOUNDS. 

149
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,325
              MMM. REALLY TASTY.
              WHAT DO YOU THINK?

150
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:35,794
THEY'RE AWESOME. SLIPPERY LITTLE
  SUCKERS, BUT THEY'RE AWESOME. 

151
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:37,796
        (Guy) DO YOU EAT        
   THE CORN AND THE POTATOES?   
MM-HMM. THAT'S

152
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:40,866

THE SEASONING, TOO. IT'S SPICY. 

153
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:42,868
     SO HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN      
     TO PEOPLE WHEN YOU SAY     

154
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,870
"I'M GOING TO A CRAWFISH BOIL"--
    PEOPLE GET FREAKED OUT?

          I DIG THAT.

                      THANK YOU.

            OF RUSSIAN DRESSING.

230
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:05,403
 I MEAN, IS IT REALLY P.C.      
TO CALL IT RUSSIAN ANYMORE?

     SOMEONE'S BRINGING GOURMET 
    SANDWICHES TO YOUR BACKYARD.
ABSOLUTELY.                     

249
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,387
  EVERYTHING HERE IS HOMEMADE,  
         FROM THE BREAD         

250
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,723
          TO THE MEATS          
        TO THE MUSTARD.         

251
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:01,259
 SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PENDING
LAWSUIT OF THE KNUCKLE SANDWICH.

252
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:03,994
     DID YOU KNOW THAT THEY, UH,
     FULL-ON RIPPED OFF MY NAME?

253
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,131
              NO.               
                     YEAH, YEAH.

254
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:08,199
          WELL, WE HAD TO TAKE--
YOU CAN CALL IT THE GUY FIERI   
      TRIBUTE SANDWICH,         

255
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:10,668
I MEAN, I'M FINE                
   WITH THAT.                   

256
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,471
SOMETHING LONG AND ELABORATE,   
    MAYBE WITH A PICTURE.       

257
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:17,008
   OKAY. ALL RIGHT,             
SO THIS IS THE KNUCKLE.         
       IT'S A GREAT CUT OF MEAT.
           IT'S VERY TENDER.    

258
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,810
SO BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO
      IS GONNA RUB IT DOWN,     

259
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:21,879
         STARTING OFF WITH      
  A LITTLE SALT ON THIS BAD BOY.

                 EARL ON THERE. 

263
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:30,554

                  A LITTLE EARL.

264
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:33,491

                   THAT'S RIGHT.

  A LITTLE BAY LEAF,            
A LITTLE--LOT OF THYME.

              BLACK PEPPERCORNS.

324
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,686
                THIS BASICALLY  
             COMES UP TO A BOIL,

325
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,156
          AND THEN INTO THE PAN.
                IN THEY GO.     

326
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:20,758
WHAT ARE WE DOING               
   WITH THIS,                   

327
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,760
CLEANING OUT                    
YOUR SINUSES?                   

328
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:24,762
      UH, WE ARE GONNA INJECT IT
            WITH THE BRINE.     

329
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:27,232
 KIND OF EXPEDITING             
THE BRINING PROCESS.            
            YEAH, HELPING IT OUT
                A LITTLE BIT,   

330
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:29,500
          YOU KNOW, WE DO LET IT
           BRINE FOR FIVE DAYS. 

331
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:31,836

        WOW.                    
            FIVE DAYS LIKE THIS.

332
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:34,639
        WE PULL IT OUT AND STICK
          OUR HAM RUB ON THERE. 

333
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:37,508
              SO WE'VE GOT SALT,
                   SUGAR...     

334
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,044
   PEPPER GUY,                  
GRANULATED GARLIC.              

335
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,780
  SOME RED CHILI FLAKE, SOME    
CHILI POWDER, AND SOME PAPRIKA. 

336
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,848
      SOME ANCHO POWDER IN THERE
         AS WELL FOR THE LOVE.  

337
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,584
                AND THEN WE JUST
                 SEASON 'EM UP. 

338
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:49,386
SO THIS GETS RUBBED             
  ON BOTH SIDES.                
                           YEAH.

339
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,056
LIBERALLY DONE. BUT THIS IS JUST
  ONE OF THE THREE COMPONENTS!  

340
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,058
 I WAS TRYING TO, LIKE,         
MONSTER TRUCK WITH THAT.        

341
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,729

                      YEAH. YEP.

     <i> (wah-wah horn plays)</i>      

344
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,936

          YET ANOTHER COMPONENT.

345
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:08,873
  PORK BELLY. SO YOU MAKE--ALL  
THE BACON THAT YOU GUYS DO HERE,

346
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,942

SO GIVE ME THE RUNDOWN.         
HOW ARE WE GONNA DO IT?         
                 SEASON IT DOWN.

348
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,482
BACON CURE IS SALT, BROWN SUGAR,
       GRANULATED GARLIC,       

349
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:19,484
       BAY LEAVES, BLACK PEPPER.
RUB IT DOWN.                    

350
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,752

LET IT SALT CURE...             
                           YEAH.

351
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,755
THEN YOU'RE GONNA TAKE IT,      
SLICE IT, COOK IT TO ORDER.     

352
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,890
                   THERE YOU GO.
