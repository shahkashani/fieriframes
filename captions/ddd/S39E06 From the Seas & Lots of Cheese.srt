76
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,966

        It's a thin-crust

     We make our own sauce.

         our tuna club.         

167

    the French toast batter.    

240
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:44,956
          We have eggs,         

241
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:46,291
   fresh ground nutmeg, salt,

00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:49,995
   Vanilla extract, cinnamon.   

244
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:52,297
         Just whisk that        
        in a little bit.        

245
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,199
    Some sugar. Heavy cream.    

246
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:56,567
        Some whole milk.

          Okay. [claps]         

248
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:59,037
    Peanut butter and jelly.    

249
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:00,905
   White bread, peanut butter,  

250
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:02,173
 and then strawberry preserves. 

251
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:03,774
      -[Guy] Okay, PB&J

        gonna just dip it       
   in the French toast batter.  

253
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:08,646
     What's this concoction     
          here of dust?         

254
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,048
     Ground Frosted Flakes.     

255
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:11,883
           Just pulsed          
      in a food processor.      

256
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,786
       Just on both sides.      
        Nice and crusted.       

257
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:18,923
         Oh, man, right.        
      How bad can that be?      

258
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:21,660
       Well, you get this       
           and you get          
       a free Spanx shirt.

260
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,331
    So how long on that side    
       are you frying it?       

261
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:27,599
  [Scott] Two to three minutes. 

262
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:31,937
          Bon appetit.

           Outrageous.

 ...is the piece de resistance. 

271
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,223
   Frosted Flakes. Corn Flakes  
  would almost make it healthy.

   Brown sugar. Dried oregano.

288

    for that grilled cheese.    

290

         Start off with         
       our garlic butter.       

291
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:39,804

299
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,955

         on December 14?        

531
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,680
         December 14th,         
 all firefighters eat for free. 

532
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,716
         We kind of lost        
        our beloved Nook.       

533
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:22,386
      When the firefighters     
     come back on that day,     
       they eat for free.       

534
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,389
   -What do the regulars say?   
      -You know, they miss      
 the diveyness of the old Nook. 

535
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:27,725
             -But--             
         -Well, you two         
         are still here.        

536
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,327
   That's divey enough, right?  

537
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:30,727
          I'd come back         
     and hang out with you.     

538
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:32,730
     We can drop this thing     
       down a few notches.      

539
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,669
       -Grilled pork chop.      
    -Bacon-wrapped scallops.    

540
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,404
           So, you got          
      anything else for us?     

541
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:43,006
           <i> But these</i>           
     <i> aren't the only places</i>    
     <i> I got to get back to.</i>     

542
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:46,577
       We got a long list       
    to get through, next time   
       on<i> Triple-D Nation.</i>      

543
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,514
     Right here, on<i> Diners,</i>     
      <i> Drive-ins and Dives.</i>     

544
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,684
         [all laughing]         

545
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,686
       [laughing] Oh, God.      

546
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:58,689
         -He did it like        
         a WWE wrestler.        
         -[all laughing]        

547
00:20:58,758 --> 00:20:59,857
       All right. Next up.
