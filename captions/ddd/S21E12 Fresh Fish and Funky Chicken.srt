       some fresh fish...

  That's the freshest experience
                you can get.

the customers happy.

                    Yeah.       

21
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:46,245
       Then, we're headed       
         across town...         

22

           What, the whole coop 
           come with this order?

27
00:00:56,257 --> 00:00:58,190
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

28

           and Dives."

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,739
 So, I'm here in Eugene, Oregon,

32
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,808
       home of the Ducks,       
      University of Oregon.     

33
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,144
  Now, what else can you expect 
    when you come to Eugene,    

34
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:21,746
       an hour and a half       
    off the coast of Oregon?    

35
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,015
           Exactly --           
      great fresh seafood.      

36
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:26,251
  That's because they got this  
  joint -- Fisherman's Market.  

37
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:31,957
   Every time I come in here,   

38
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:34,359
       they'll be bringing      
         fresh fish in,         

39
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:37,295
 you know, whether it's gonna be
  salmon or albacore, halibut.  

40
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:39,498
      They're live right there, 
     they cook them right there,

41
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,700
   and they serve it right here,
                and I eat it.   

42
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:44,236
             Ryan --            
  He just is an expert on fish. 

43
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:47,906
      FIERI: That's because

        All the fish that's here
               is coming from?  

47

Mostly all from Oregon.

      and all the hookups and --

  Yeah. [ Laughs ]              

50
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:05,123
      It's like                 
it was swimming yesterday.      

51
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,791
      Some of it still is.      

52
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,460
 See the crab in the crab tank, 

53
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,128
    and then they cook it up    
         for you fresh.         

54
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,997
       It's just amazing.       

55
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:13,798
Crab dinner with fries and slaw.

56
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,602
They cook the crab in a crab pot
    right out the front door.   

57
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:19,671
     Can't get any fresher.     

58
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:20,805
Give me the rundown, man.       

59
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,208
        Okay. So, we got our pot
             full of hot water. 

60
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,544
         We add salt to make it 
    about the same as the ocean.

61
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,280
    So, these are               
   live Dungeness.              
                        Live.   

62
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:29,348
   Where are these              
    coming from?                

63
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,016
               Off of our boat  
               out in Newport.  

64
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:33,352
      So, we like to put them in
                upside down,    

65
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:35,220
           'cause then the claws
             come in like this. 

66
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:37,155
      You put them in backwards,
        the claws go like that, 

67
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,156
             and they drop them.

68
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,092
    And how long                
do they take to cook?           

69
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:43,362
                Anywhere from   
              25 to 45 minutes. 

70
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:45,297
Then what's gonna happen?       

71
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,633
       You're gonna get some ice
           in the cooling tank, 

72
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:49,301
               chill them down  
             as fast as we can. 

73
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,437
How many pounds of crab         
 is that right now?             

74
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,972
              That's about 50.  

75
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:55,440
        We can do 100 at a time.

76
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,576
        Wow.                    

77
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,244
I'm gonna say we're gonna go    
for an electric winch           

78
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:00,311
 one of these days.             

79
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,046
     This is a huge improvement.

80
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:03,782
             We used to do them 
          one at a time by hand.

81
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,518
Let them all cool down.         

82
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,853
Stop the cooking process.       
                            Yep.

   And while those guys chill,  

84
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,725
         well, it's time        
       to slay some slaw.       

85
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:16,328
This is our cilantro lime       
dressing for our coleslaw.      

86
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,264
First, we put in salt,          
      jalapeño.                 

87
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,400
       A small amount of garlic.

88
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:23,201
Get that all mixed up.

00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,411
Now we're gonna make            
      the slaw.                 

94
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,548
Pour that in for us,            
and we'll get her done.

00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:36,074
         Dungeness crab         
      is especially sweet.      

121
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:38,943
     And it's got such a

  I like the Fisherman's Market 

123
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,413
         because there's        
   just nothing else like it.   

124
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:43,649
     It's extremely unique.

        Any kind of fish.

146
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:31,996
                It literally    
              has been a mess.  

147

    The flavor's incredible.    

153
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,609
  It reminds me of New Orleans. 

154
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,812
               And how are we   
           gonna start this off?

155
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:49,881
We're gonna purge the crawfish, 
get them cleaned up.

        Those are some monsters.

       No.                      
No. These are wild.             
      No? These are wild-caught?

 Yeah. They come out            
of clean lakes, clean streams.

162
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:02,494
      Put them                  
in the boiling water.

we gonna let them go?           

165
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:08,233
                   ROGERS:      
             About five minutes.

167
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,105

 Dump the butter in.            

171
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:22,914
 So, just a small, petite amount
         of butter -- 5 pounds.

   with flavor in.

               of heavy cream.  

195
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,568

217
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:07,752

                 is awesome.

00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,242
 And that just goes             
  right up on top?              

451
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:53,778
                Right on top.   

452
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,585
The meat is super-tender,       
but a lot of uniqueness to it.  

453
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:01,853
Everything's done perfectly.    

454
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,521
The hominy is spot-on.          

455
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,256
You know, get the acid          
  out of the salad.             

456
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,191
    Then you get                
the nuttiness of the corn.      

457
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:11,328
But you put all of that together
in this perfect bite.           

458
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,497
 That's outrageous.             

459
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:18,268
            It's very flavorful 
           and moist and tender.

460
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,872
   You can just pull it apart   
          with a fork.          

461
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:21,939
     It melts in your mouth.    

462
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:23,474
     [ Laughs ] It's heaven.    
        It's good stuff.        

463
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,009
 "Mi Patria" means?             

464
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:26,544
             "My homeland." Yes.
"My homeland."                  

465
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,546
 How do you explain             
  Ecuadorian food?              

466
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:31,149
                 Flavorful,     
              colorful, unique. 

467
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:35,152
               Got empanadas    
               in the window.   

468
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,154
          FIERI: Where you from?
  Ecuador.                      

469
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:38,423
      How close is this to home?
The same.                       

470
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:39,924
       This could be in Ecuador?
 Yeah, yeah.                    

471
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,760
            MIRANDA:            
    Arroz con pollo is ready.   

472
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,896
      Oh, this is my guilty     
      pleasure right here.      

473
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:48,031
    It's amazing how they've    
     taken chicken and rice     

474
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:50,567
          and turned it         
  into something super-special. 

475
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:54,304
    We're gonna cook our chicken
       for our arroz con pollo. 
Fire it up.                     

476
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:56,573
                First, we got   
             the whole chicken. 

477
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,708
                  Put them      
           in the boiling water.

478
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,510
  Oh, that's it?                
                     That's it. 

479
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:00,511
               Chicken breast.  

480
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:01,712
                  And then      
           we're gonna season it

481
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:04,382
                with our salt   
        and our house seasoning.

482
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:05,583
    And how long                
 is that gonna boil?            

483
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,251
       30 minutes to 45 minutes.

484
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,986
   Okay. So, then               
we're gonna shred it.           

485
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,524
        Okay.                   
Now, what's our next dish?      

486
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:14,926
                We're making    
         our homemade hot sauce.

487
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:15,860
And what do we call this?       

488
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:17,395
                    Aji.        
      Aji.                      

489
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:18,930
             Okay. First of all,
               we're gonna put  

490
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,131
                the jalapeños   
                into the pan.   

491
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:23,133
         And this is our secret 
      weapon -- tomate de árbol.

492
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,469
Tomatoes of the tree.           
                   Tree tomato. 

493
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:26,971
             Well, it's actually
                just a fruit.   

494
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,540
It's like an unripe papaya.     

495
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:31,209
This gets shipped in            
    from Ecuador?               

496
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:32,143
        Shipped in from Ecuador,
                  as well.      

497
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:33,411
All right. So, we're            
gonna drop that in.             

498
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:36,114
              We're gonna boil  
           for 15 to 20 minutes.

499
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:38,182
 And then puree it?             

500
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,287
              Now we assembled  
         our homemade hot sauce.

501
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,089
              We got red onion, 
              peas and carrots, 

502
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:49,026
         salt, fresh lime juice,
                  cilantro.     

503
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:50,494
     Very nice.                 

504
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:51,495
              I love cilantro.  

505
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:54,499
  We pour that in,              
and that's the salsa?           

506
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:56,067
                    Aji.        
      Aji.                      

507
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,239
 Don't get me wrong.            
       It's --                  

508
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:03,107
  Whoa! That's hot!             

509
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:04,308
                Can you taste   
                the jalapeño?   

510
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,644
 No! No, no, no, no.            
                    [ Laughs ]  

511
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,779
  Aji for me.                   
                  Aji for you.  

512
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:11,115
    Okay.                       
              This is gonna be  
              our mejunje dish. 

513
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:12,984
   Mejunje dish.                
   All right. Go.               

514
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:16,587
      Achiote oil and red onion.

515
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:17,721
             Green bell peppers.

516
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:20,591
      Salt, our house seasoning.

517
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:23,594
So, sweat down the peppers      
   and the onion.               
                          Yep.  

518
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:25,129
              Peas and carrots. 

519
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:26,864
                  Chicken.      

520
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:29,400
 And the cilantro.              
                      Cilantro. 

521
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:30,667
How long will this cook         
      together?                 

522
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,003
               15, 20 minutes.  

523
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,739
Then once it's done, it gets    
mixed with the yellow rice?     

524
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:35,506
                    Yes.        

525
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,747
         Oh.                    
  <i> Now</i> we do that.              

526
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,282
This is to make it pretty.      

527
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:48,219
It's beautiful.                 
          Sweet, ripe plantains.

528
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:49,687
         We serve this with aji.

529
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:50,655
                Here you go.    

530
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,894
    This is like                
Ecuadorian fried rice.          

531
00:19:58,097 --> 00:20:00,964
The green bell pepper -- That's 
probably my favorite part,      

532
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,499
   because that's               
such a distinct flavor.         

533
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:06,037
But the real surprise in it     
are the peas and carrots.       

534
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:10,374
     Little pop.                
Little velvety texture.         

535
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,243
I mean, what's not to love      
     about that?                

536
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:14,979
    And that aji,               
that salsa right there --       

537
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:17,048
I'm stealing that one           
      for sure.                 

538
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,251
         WOMAN: The meat        
   is definitely very savory,   

539
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:22,052
           but, then,           
  you have the sweet plantains. 

540
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,588
  Kind of like having a dessert 
         with your meal.        

541
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:28,859
       I can consider this      
  the closest to my home food.  

542
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:32,863
I mean, just really authentic   
Ecuadorian scratch-made, man.   

543
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:35,399
   Great stuff.                 
                     Thank you.

            not gonna be pretty.
