00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,176
                Steak sauce,    
           Worcestershire sauce,

121
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,646
            add the skirt steak,
                fresh lemon,    

122
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:09,714
             little rice pilaf, 
                 steak tips     

123
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,450
             and a little piece 
               of feta cheese   

124
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:13,852
               with some char   
             grilled pita bread.

125
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:17,722
 Mmm. Dude, is that             
the Marsala in there --         

126
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:20,124
Worcestershire and Marsala      
  and steak sauce?              

127
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:21,592
                 Yes, combo.    

128
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,194
I want a steak sandwich         
      of that.                  

129
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,463
              A toasted hoagie. 

130
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:26,731
Seriously, it's not good,       
  it's phenomenal.              

131
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:27,999
               Pick up please.  

132
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,802
           Steak tips themselves
                are so tender   

133
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:32,738
           and it is a beautiful
                cut of meat.    

134
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,871
              It's really good. 

135
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:36,475
I love the flavors and          
I really like the sauce.        

136
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:37,942
There's something in there.     

137
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,745
 It's a new flavor.             
  It's a new spice.             

138
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:40,745
   It's a winner.               

139
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:41,680
              Mmm.              

140
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:42,547
 What're these here?            

141
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:43,749
           GUS: Beef stroganoff.

142
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:45,083
 When I think of an             
old school diner dish           

143
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:46,885
it would be something           
like beef stroganoff.           

144
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,620
     It's been on the menu since
             the day we opened, 

145
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:49,887
             about 25 years now.

146
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:52,424
         We used to have it only
      once a week, every Friday,

147
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:53,758
        but it became so popular

148
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,160
              we have it on the 
             menu everyday now. 

149
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:56,495
         Onions, chopped garlic.

150
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:59,030
            We use beef brisket,
       and we cut it into cubes.

151
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,165
         We find it very tender.

152
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,034
             Little bit of salt,
                black pepper,   

153
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:03,835
                white pepper,   
             granulated garlic, 

154
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:06,104
        bay leafs, chicken base,
                   water.       

155
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:09,040
          Cover it. Let it cook.

156
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,109
           Add the mushrooms and
       mix 'em up with the meat.

157
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,779
      The main ingredient of the
     stroganoff is a sour cream.

158
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:15,313
               We're gonna add  
           a little heavy cream,

159
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,716
           a little corn starch,
     a little bit of white wine.

160
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:19,517
    We serve the beef stroganoff
              with egg noodles, 

161
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:24,789
       a little Parmesan cheese,
           and a little parsley.

162
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:25,724
The meat's super tender.        

163
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:26,725
   It's not heavy.              

164
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:28,259
 Actually, the sauce            
  is kind of light.             

165
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,861
It's got real beef flavor.      

166
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:32,597
  This dish has been so popular,
              people will call, 

167
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,399
  they'll say "please reserve me
              two stroganoffs.  

168
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:35,400
        I'll wait for the table,

169
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:37,068
              but don't run out 
            of beef stroganoff."

170
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,403
    Outstanding.                

171
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,204
 WOMAN: The noodles, the sauce, 
    the beef, everything just   

172
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,939
      beautifully blended,      
      it tastes delicious.      

173
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,743
Beef stroganoff is always       
one of my go-to menu items.     

174
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:46,678
Hits all the taste buds in      
      my mouth.                 

175
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,678
 It's unbelievable.             

176
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,815
     Delicious.                 

177
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:51,549
        FIERI: Of course        
    they're still serving up    

178
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:54,353
   the same Greek staples that  
  I had in my first go around.  

179
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:56,354
           You get a free little
           piece of spanakopita.

180
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,155
        It's like a Greek touch.

181
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:58,356
Okay, so how do we make it?     

182
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,092
              Melt our butter,  
         extra virgin olive oil.

183
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:02,694
         Now we take our onions,
    fresh scallions, fresh dill,

184
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,295
    black pepper, little nutmeg.

185
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,897
            -Really?            
          -Little salt,         

186
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:06,898
      got our spinach over here.

187
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,166
 Want me to get all             
the stuff outta here?           

188
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:09,167
               Yeah yeah yeah,  
             that's the flavor. 

189
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:10,501
      Gonna add our feta cheese.

190
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:11,569
            Now we put our eggs.

191
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:12,437
 That's the binder.             

192
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,371
                    Yep.        

193
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,506
And now we're going to layer    

194
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:16,842
   800,000 sheets               
  of phyllo dough.              

195
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:18,509
                  Perfect.      

196
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:19,444
Crooked lines are okay?         

197
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:22,447
               You gotta gimme  
               some room here.  

198
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:23,849
              You know what the 
           secret ingredient is?

199
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:27,652
                  Smell it.     
                 Be careful.    

200
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:28,519
       Water?                   

201
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:32,724
                 [ Laughs ]     
              It's water, H2O.  

202
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,059
             Put a little bit of
     water on top of the phyllo,

203
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,193
         it doesn't break apart.

204
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:37,262
         Bless this spinach pie.

205
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:38,796
                 [ Laughs ]     

206
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:42,534
    I pray that this spinach pie
 is the best one I've ever made.

207
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:44,736
Oh, man. That is excellent.     

208
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,138
Man, that's great flavor.       
   That's awesome.              

209
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,873
                 Thank you.     

210
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:52,677
FIERI: But he's not just pulling
 from his own cultural cookbook.

211
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:53,945
That's a good-looking           
       paella.                  

212
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:56,815
       When we come back,       
     Gus is driving the bus     

213
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:59,284
 on an international expedition.

214
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:01,486
Little bit like a jambalaya.    
   It's fantastic.              

215
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,355
    Grab a fork.                
Now we're gonna eat this.       

216
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:04,089
                 [ Laughs ]     

217
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:12,697
            Order up.           

218
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:13,832
             FIERI:             
 I'm reliving the good ol' days 

219
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:16,501
         outside Atlanta        
      in Marietta, Georgia.     

220
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:20,037
  Well here's a classic one for 
ya -- a big, shiny, steel diner.

221
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:23,375
  Run by a big extended family  
        with a huge menu        

222
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:25,977
   full of all kinds of food,   
        especially Greek.       

223
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,113
       It's been 10 years,      
        and I gotta say,        

224
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,514
 things look a little different.

225
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:30,315
        Wow.                    

226
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:31,516
                This whole...   

227
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:33,117
 Yeah, what changed,            
 besides everything?            

228
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,085
             This was the lobby.

229
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:35,921
 This was the lobby             
    of the diner.               

230
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:38,222
    This was it, pre "Triple D."

231
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,058
So I helped pave some           
 of this boulevard.             

232
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,794
    "Triple D" shows up, and you
    gotta make the lobby bigger.

233
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,996
  And the menu is also amped up 

234
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:48,600
      with over 500 choices     
    from all over the world.    

235
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:51,870
     When Guy was here the first
time, he had the seafood paella.

236
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:53,204
How many people's this feed?    

237
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,140
            Nobody leaves hungry

368

      the Caesar dressing,      

369
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:27,278

       blended olive oil,       
 grated Pecorino Romano cheese,

00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,555
           mayonnaise,          
   and fresh chopped oregano.   

374
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:41,426
 Then we season our ground beef 
   patty with roasted garlic.   

375
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,628
         Then we enrobe         
   the applewood smoked bacon   

376

           with gouda,          

377
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:47,431

00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,302
      Yoga studio, carwash.     

594
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:39,704
      I mean you never know     
     what you're gonna find     

595
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:41,705
      when you take a spin      
       around Flavortown.       

596
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:42,640
           -What's up?          
              -Opa!             

597
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:43,975
      Like Gus in Georgia,      

598
00:20:43,977 --> 00:20:47,178
  who pushes his 24-hour diner  
       into the red zone,       

599
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,781
    over to Arizona where Joe   
   keeps the food funky fresh   

600
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:53,384
  at his farm and table joint.  

601
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:55,052
 And deep at the heart of Texas,

602
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:57,721
     there's Lisa killing it    
    with her creative combos    

603
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,390
   in and out of the kitchen.   

604
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:00,925
 And they're not the only ones. 

605
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:03,860
    We got plenty more places   
      to pop into next time     

606
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,396
      on "Triple D Nation."     

607
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:07,597
Sing the ingredients.           

608
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,733
♪ We got-ah the meat ♪          

609
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:13,537
         ♪ Cubes meat over here,
             we put some water ♪
