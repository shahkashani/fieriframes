THIS IS ALSO ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR. 

140
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:40,605
           THIS ALLOWS THE YEAST

MM-HMM.                         

141

151
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:05,497

157
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:20,645
      HEY! AND NOW WE'VE GOT    
   TO ROLL THIS THING OUT. OKAY.

159
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,649
                 WE CAN CUT OUT 
                 THE HOLE AFTER.

160
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,652

LET 'EM RISE, AND THEN

BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THAT.      

170
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:48,540

172
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:53,078
        AND THEN WE DIP IT      
   IN THE BACON, AND THAT'S IT. 

173
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,413
OH.

WOW, THAT'S GREAT.              

175

THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS.        

176
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:01,620
   YOU SHOULD LIMIT PEOPLE TO

              WELL, YOU HAVE TO.

221
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,026
BECAUSE EVENTUALLY IT--         
                  OTHERWISE,    
              IT WOULD BE SYRUP.

222
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,096
BEFORE WE PUT 'EM IN THE WATER  
  WE MAKE SURE WE SCORE 'EM.    
                           YEAH.

223
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:54,499
THE STOCK IS BASICALLY          
    40 YEARS OLD.               
               SO YOU JUST KEEP 
             ROTATING THE STOCK.

224
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,501
AND THEN WE ADD

ONCE THE SHELL'S OPEN,          
 THEY'RE GOOD TO GO.            

287
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,451
 AWESOME, SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO
     IS STRAIN OUT THE JUICE.   
SO THAT'S THE BROTH             

288
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:29,054
THAT'S GONNA GET USED           
IN MAKING THE CHOWDER.          

289
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:31,722

        SLICE UP THE BACON.     
MAD KNIFE SKILLS.               

291
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:35,793

 ADD THAT TO THE POT.           

292
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,929
NEXT THING WE'RE GONNA DO       
   IS ADD SOME ONIONS.          

293
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:39,664
ONCE THOSE GET TRANSLUCENT,     
   WE'LL ADD THE LEAKS,         

294
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:42,000
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA ADD        
    CHOPPED CELERY.             
         FOR A LITTLE SWEETNESS.

295
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,601

298
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:50,208

299
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,810
NEXT WE'RE GONNA ADD CHOPPED

301
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:55,146

       THAT'S PURE FLAVOR, BABY.

302
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,616
    WE'RE GONNA ADD             
THE FRESH CHOPPED CLAMS.        
              SO THAT'S SIMMERED
                A LITTLE BIT.   

303
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,684

00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,953
           AND WHAT ARE WE GONNA
                 MAKE HERE?     
    WE'RE GONNA MAKE OUR        
CATTLEMEN'S STEAK SEASONING.    

377
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,689
      THIS IS WHAT YOU SPRINKLE 
    ON THE STEAKS WHEN IT COOKS.
ON EVERY STEAK.                 

378
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:53,691
             MUST MAKE THIS BY  
          THE 50,000-GALLON DRUM

379
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:55,559
                      EVERY DAY.
UH, VERY LARGE.                 

380
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,628
                           YEAH.
        A LITTLE SALT,          
GRANULATED GARLIC, ONION SALT,  

381
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:59,630
 SEASONING SALT                 
AND BLACK PEPPER.               

382
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,699
MAKE SURE IT'S MIXED UP         
 REAL GOOD. THAT'S IT.          

383
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,701
             MMM. PUT SOME MORE 
             OF THAT IN MY HAND.

384
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:05,703
           SO NOW WE'RE GONNA   
         THROW IT ON THE GRILL. 

385
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,772
      JUST A LITTLE BIT OF THAT 
      SEASONING, AND THAT WORKS 

386
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,441
    WITH THE FAT AND THE NATURAL
         JUICES OF THE MEAT.    

387
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,976
                    WOW, THAT   
                 IS SMOKIN' HOT.
650 DEGREES.                    

388
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,712
                THIS WILL TAKE  
              NINE, TEN MINUTES?
YEAH, ABOUT TEN MINUTES.        

389
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:17,715
                THAT'S          
      A GOOD-LOOKING STEAK, MAN.
       FLIP IT.                 
I'M GONNA SEASON IT.            

390
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:19,784
I THINK WE'RE READY TO GO.      
      STEAK FOR TEN.            

391
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:21,785
 A LITTLE AU JUS.               
WE MAKE OUR AU JUS.             

392
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,389
  THERE WE GO,                  
READY FOR DINNER.               
                   LOOK AT THAT.

393
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:29,660
                  SAY SOMETHING.
YOU DON'T NEED TO SAY ANYTHING. 
     IT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.      

394
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:31,796
      SUPER TENDER,             
THE GRILLING IS PERFECT.        

395
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,931
THE AU JUS IS A NICE TOUCH.     
     THAT'S DELICIOUS.          

396
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:37,869
  TASTES LIKE THE MOST DELICATE 
        MOIST MEAT EVER.        

397
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:39,938
 ONE OF THE FINEST STEAKS       
YOU CAN GET IN THE COUNTRY.     

398
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:43,474
 <i> BASIC, BACON-WRAPPED, THEY'RE</i> 
  <i> EVEN DOING STEAK AU POIVRE.</i>

      AND THIS IS PERFECT.      

400
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,478
   WE'RE GONNA MAKE             
SOME PEPPERCORN SAUCE.          

401

                           OKAY.
    THEN WE'RE

00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,699
THAT'S A LITTLE                 
CULINARY CREAM.                 
          CRèME FRAîCHE IS WHAT

   IT REALLY ADDS A LITTLE KICK.
GREAT STEAKS.

AND THEN CAME HERE TO EAT.      

427
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:52,543
        IT REALLY CAPTURES      
   THE OKLAHOMA FRONTIER IMAGE. 

428
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:55,079

  <i> WITH AN OLD OKLAHOMA MENU.</i>

               THIS IS NOT      
           GONNA BE GOOD FOR ME.

435
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:10,561
MAKE SURE THOSE BRAINS          
 ARE GOOD AND TENDER.           

436
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,897

           I DON'T LIKE EGGS,   
        AND I DON'T LIKE BRAINS.

439

    THE CHICKEN,                

443
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:31,982

                 THAT'S CORRECT.

444
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,918

           FANTASTIC.           

465
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,004
 <i> TO THE COCONUT CREAM PIE...</i>   
        IT'S EXCELLENT.         

466
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:30,073
   <i> TO THE SALAD DRESSING...</i>    
               CATTLEMEN'S      
         SPECIAL HOUSE DRESSING.

467
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:32,877
          <i> FOLKS HERE</i>           
<i>HAVE BEEN LOVING FOR DECADES.</i>   
JUST OUTSTANDING.               

468
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,613
                 HOUSE DRESSING.
                  WHAT'S IN IT? 
DAVID'LL NEVER TELL ME.         
     I DON'T KNOW.              

469
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:37,615
   WHEN WE BOUGHT THE RESTAURANT
     FROM THE PREVIOUS OWNER,   

470
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:39,816
        HE OPENED UP HIS WALLET 
        AND PULLED OUT A LITTLE 

471
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:41,953
    PIECE OF PAPER, AND THAT    
 WAS THE HOUSE DRESSING RECIPE. 

472
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,889
     HE HAD IT FOR 45 YEARS,    
 AND THEN HE PASSED IT ON TO US.

473
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:47,558
WHO MAKES THE DRESSING?         
              ROSIE. SHE WON'T  
            GIVE YOU THE RECIPE,

474
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,760
             BUT SHE'LL SHOW YOU
              HOW SHE MAKES IT. 
YOU JUST MAKE IT.               

475
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,029
                   THAT'S RIGHT.
    DON'T TALK TO ME            
ABOUT ANY OF THE DETAILS.       

476
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:55,166
               I DON'T TALK     
            ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE.
       OKAY,                    
LET'S GET IT GOING.

    THAT IS GARLIC OIL.         

486
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:17,455

       THAT'S JUST A QUART TO GO
       WITH ALL THIS--ALL OF IT.
