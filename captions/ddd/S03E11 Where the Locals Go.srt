            THE WHASKILY WABBIT?
          <i> LIKE RABBIT</i>

483
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:42,086
  <i> AND SNAPPIN' TURTLE SOUP.</i>    
GOOD TURTLE SOUP.               

484
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:44,422
   IT'S WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT   
     TO SEE IN NEW ORLEANS.     

485
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:46,824
         <i> BUT SOMETIMES</i>         
      <i> THIS LOUISIANA CROWD</i>     

486

  <i> JUST WANTS A LOCAL FAVORITE.</i> 

487
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:50,428
           MONDAYS IS           
     RED BEANS AND RICE DAY.    

488
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,630
     GOOD RED BEANS AND RICE    
           IS CREAMY.           

489
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:54,598
      THIS HAS ENOUGH HEAT      
    TO GIVE IT A GOOD FLAVOR.   

490
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,767
ALL RIGHT, SO WE'RE GONNA       
MAKE RED BEANS AND RICE,        

491
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:58,502
   WHICH DOESN'T MEAN           
JUST RED BEANS AND RICE.        

492
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:01,372
THERE'S A LOT MORE INVOLVED,    
AND OUR OLD FRIEND BACON FAT.   

493
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:02,907
                 SO KIDNEY BEANS
                   ARE DRIED.   

494
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,509
 RIGHT, AND THEY'VE BEEN SOAKED 
    OVERNIGHT IN JUST WATER.    

495
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:07,311
 WOULD YOU LOOK                 
AT THIS BIG OL'--               
                      HOLY HOCK.

496
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,447
SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO          
IS PUT OUR HAM HOCK IN.         

497
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:11,983
A LITTLE BIT OF WORCESTERSHIRE, 
  A LITTLE BIT OF HOT SAUCE.    

498
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:14,986
OUR OLD FRIEND THE TRINITY--    
   VEGETABLES, BAY LEAVES.      

499
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:18,122
TURN AROUND JUMPER.             
       HUH?                     

500
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:20,524
        SO THIS IS GONNA GO IN  
       A SIMMER FOR FOUR HOURS? 

501
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:22,460
ABOUT FOUR HOURS OR SO, AND IT'S
 GONNA GET NICE AND BREAK DOWN, 

502
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,262
AND GET NICE                    
AND CREAMY.                     

503
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:26,264
  AND THE HOCK                  
IS DISINTEGRATED?               
                 THEY ACTUALLY--

504
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:28,399
         YOU MIGHT FIND SOME--  
       THERE'S A CHUNK IN THERE.
WELL, THERE'S A CHUNK.          

505
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:30,267
        THE BACON FAT MAKES THIS
          A LOT CREAMIER, TOO.  
WHAT IS THIS?                   

506
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:33,270
    YOU DO THIS WITH A GRILLED  
   CHICKEN OR A SMOKED SAUSAGE. 

507
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:35,273
          IT'S KIND OF SWEET,   
      HAS A MAPLE SORT OF GLAZE.

508
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,241
          IT COMPLEMENTS THINGS 
          REALLY WELL, I THINK. 

509
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:40,144
I'M DREDGING FOR CHUNK.         

510
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:44,215
  THAT'S TOO GOOD               
TO BE GOOD FOR YOU.             

511
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,350
I GET A WHANG                   
   TO IT.                       

512
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:49,020
   LIKE, I'M GETTING A LOT OF   
THE WORCESTERSHIRE OR SOMETHING.

513
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:51,956
 IT JUST HAS A DEPTH FAR BEYOND 
  JUST REGULAR BEANS AND RICE.  

514
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:55,960
   I TELL YOU, THIS HAS         
THAT SAME CREAMY, VELVETY,      

515
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:58,429

522
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:14,445
          COMBINES WITH         
   THE BEANS AND RICE NICELY.   

523
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:17,915
 REALLY CREAMY, AND IT HAS      
A REALLY GOOD FLAVOR TO IT.
