               PUT A FEW PICKLES
                    ON HERE.

                  ON THE INSIDE.

106
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,726
       LOOK AT THAT.

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,668
THAT COMES GUSHING              
OUT OF THIS THING.              

110
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,536
THE MEAT'S GOT A REALLY GREAT   
       TEXTURE TO IT.           

111
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,805
I PICK UP THE WORCESTERSHIRE    
 THAT'S IN THE STEAK SAUCE.     

112
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:36,541
   THE SWEETNESS OF THE PICKLE  
 COUNTERACTS WITH THE SALTINESS 

113
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:39,411
   AND THE TANG                 
OF THE BLUE CHEESE.             
                       YEP, YEP.

114
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:41,346
I CAN SEE WHY THE BLUCY         
    IS SO POPULAR.

 IT'S REALLY GOOD.              
I LOVE BLUE CHEESE.

         <i> BUILDING 'EM.</i>         

123

              WITH FRENCH FRIES.

      OF RED WINE.              
                     ABSOLUTELY.

127
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,172
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY           
TIMES I SAY A BURGER            

128
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:09,841
NEEDS A GLASS OF WINE.          
  <i> HOW ABOUT A GLASS OF O.J.?</i>   

129
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:13,578

                BREAKFAST       

131
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,783

  WHY STOP THERE?

              TAUGHT ME,        

275
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:56,220
                      MY MOTHER.
THIS IS HOW WE DO IT.           

276
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,356
    ADD THE EGGS, THEN SALT,    
A LITTLE EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL.

277
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,790
BECAUSE OUR PITCHFORK           
   IS IN THE SHOP,              

278
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,826
 WE'RE GONNA WHIP               
THE EGGS WITH THIS.             

279
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,761
  EACH TIME HE MIXES IT AROUND, 
     A LITTLE BIT MORE FLOUR    

280
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:07,499
CATCHES IN, INCORPORATING       
     INTO THE EGGS.             
                NOW IT'S KIND OF
                   LIKE PASTY,  

281
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:08,967
            WE CAN START FOLDING
                IN THE FLOUR.   

282
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:11,502
AND NOW JUST AS MUCH FLOUR      
WILL STICK TO IT AS IT CAN.     

283
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,704
       AND DO YOU DO            
ALL THE PREP AND EVERYTHING     

284
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,573
IN THIS LITTLE KITCHEN?         
                            YES.

285
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:17,575
AND YOU'RE HERE                 
SIX DAYS A WEEK?                
                       YES, SIR.

286
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:19,710
           I DO ALL THE SHOPPING
              AND EVERYTHING,   

287
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:21,712
   I PICK EVERYTHING OUT MYSELF,
      MY PRODUCE, EVERYTHING.   
WAIT A MINUTE--                 

288
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:24,849
SERIOUSLY?                      
       YES, SIR, I GO TWO, THREE
      TIMES A DAY TO THE MARKET.

289
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,851
   GROWING UP IN ITALY, WE GREW 
    OUR OWN VEGETABLES, HERBS,  

290
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,186
   AND EVERYTHING, AND WE RAISED
       ALL OUR OWN ANIMALS.     

291
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:30,855
I RAISED MY OWN                 
 ANIMALS, TOO.                  
                           YEAH.

292
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,792
  I NAMED THEM                  
HUNTER AND RYDER.               

293
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:35,860
         OKAY, HERE'S THE DOUGH.
           PUT A BOWL OVER IT.  

294
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,862
     WE'LL LET IT REST FOR ABOUT
     A HALF AN HOUR, 45 MINUTES.
SET IT ON THE COUNTER,          

295
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,864
NEXT THING, YOU'LL JUST         
START ROLLING THIS OUT.         

296
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,866
AND THIS IS A HAND CRANK        
     PASTA MACHINE--            

297
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:43,868
NO ELECTRIC PASTA MACHINE       
      FOR THIS GUY.             

298
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:45,870
GIVE ME THE RUNDOWN.            
               OKAY, RIP IT     
          WITH YOUR HAND, FLOUR,

299
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:48,873
WE'RE MAKING A SHEETED PASTA.   
 WE WANT TO GENTLY DO THIS,     

300
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,875
   SO YOU START THIS            
ON THE LARGEST NUMBER...        
                        EXACTLY,

301
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,877
    AND WE'RE GONNA WORK OUR WAY
         DOWN TO LIKE 2 1/2.    

302
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,813
      WOW, LOOK AT THIS.        
SWEET MUSIC TO THIS RIGHT NOW-- 

303
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:58,149
THIS SHOULD BE A VIDEO.         
                   WHEN I GET   
                TOWARDS THE END,

304
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,884
 WE'RE GONNA FOLD IT AND MAKE IT
    A LITTLE BIT MORE WIDER,    

305
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,887
             BETTER CONSISTENCY.
SO IT REALLY FITS INSIDE        
  OF THE RAVIOLI MOLD.          

306
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,889
          EXACTLY, THERE YOU GO.
              A LITTLE FLOUR.   

307
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,891
     RIGHT ON TOP OF THE MOLD.  
  JUST PRESS IT IN A LITTLE BIT,

308
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,627
          'CAUSE THAT'S WHERE   
      THE FILLING'S GONNA GO IN.

309
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:10,962
WOW, YOU DON'T SKIMP            
  ON THE FILLING.               
                           NOPE.

310
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,898
  I JUST WANT YOU TO SEE THIS-- 
   THAT RIGHT THERE IS PLENTY,  

311
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,900
   BUT THAT IS HOW MUCH         
HE PUTS IN A RAVIOLI HERE.      

312
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:18,702
         CRAZY.                 
NOW WE DO ANOTHER SHEET?        
              YEP, RIGHT ON TOP.

313
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:21,238
         PRESS DOWN TILL THE TWO
          PASTAS SEAL TOGETHER. 

314
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:22,373
                   FLIP IT OVER.
ONE, TWO...                     

315
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,442
    TAKE THE MOLD OFF, AND THEN 
   CUT IT WITH THE DOUGH CUTTER.

316
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:26,244
          SMOOTH THE RIDGES OUT,
              THEN WHAT WE DO   

317
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,913
                    IS PRESS 'EM
                   ON ALL SIDES.
MAKE SURE THAT THEY SEAL,       
THERE'S NO AIR IN THESE.        

318
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,649
NOW YOU HIT A LITTLE FLOUR,     
 PUT 'EM ON A SHEET TRAY.       
                WHAT WE'LL DO   
            IS WE'LL FREEZE 'EM.

319
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,651
THEY'LL SEAL EVEN BETTER,       
AND THEN YOU'RE OFF TO GO.      

320
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,720
WE'RE GONNA MAKE THE LOBSTER    
     RAVIOLI SAUCE NOW.         
                      FANTASTIC.

321
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,856
SOME EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL,    
   SHALLOTS, LOBSTER MEAT.      

322
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:40,658
                      SERIOUSLY?
    YEAH, SALT, PEPPER,         
LET THAT SWEAT A LITTLE BIT.    

323
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:43,060
NEXT WE'LL ADD OUR BRANDY.      
                  WHOA!         
          IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED?

324
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,530
 YEAH, THAT'S WHY--THAT'S WHY-- 
       THAT'S WHAT IT IS.       

325
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:47,398
ONCE IT'S DONE FLAMING,         
     TOMATO SAUCE,              

326
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,000
HEAVY CREAM, BUTTER,            
  SOME FRESH BASIL.             

327
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,670
NOW WE'RE GONNA LET IT          
       REDUCE.                  
         WE'RE GONNA PUT THIS   
      ON TO THE 15-STEP RAVIOLI.

328
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:54,205
PUT ON EIGHT RAVIOLIS           
    TO AN ORDER,                

329
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:56,808
   FOR ABOUT TWO                
AND A HALF MINUTES.             
           YOU WANT TO HAVE THIS
             ON A SIMMER BOIL,  

330
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:59,344
       NOT A RAPID BOIL, SO YOU 
     DON'T BEAT THESE THINGS UP.
EXACTLY.                        

331
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:01,946
             RAVIS ARE FLOATING.
YES, LET 'EM DRAIN,             
 ADD IN THE SAUCE.

                  HERE COMES    
               THE MONSTER MEAL.

   JUST DROP 'EM RIGHT IN THERE.
         LOBSTER RAVIOLI.       

334
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,553
I CAN FEEL THE FIRMNESS         
     IN THE PASTA.              

335
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,956
     MMM, AHH.                  
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.              

336
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:15,827
I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD HUG YOU
  OR KIDNAP YOU TO CALIFORNIA.  

337
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,629

WITH THOSE TOMATOES--MMM.       

339
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,633
   THERE IS NOTHING             
I WOULD CHANGE ON THAT.         

340
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:24,168
 I'VE BEEN TO ITALY.            
I'VE HAD GREAT PASTA,

  A SPECIAL GUY, SPECIAL FOOD.  

460
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,628

DINER WE EVER DID ON TRIPLE "D,"

464
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:28,539
        THE BAYWAY DINER        
     IN LINDEN, NEW JERSEY.     

465

       IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.       

471
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:46,891
  I COME FROM THE CITY. THERE'S 
 MILLIONS OF DINERS IN THE CITY,

472
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,492
      BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE      
         BAYWAY DINER.          
            LET'S ROCK 'N' ROLL.

473
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:50,027
      IT'S BEEN AN ABSOLUTE     
           WHIRLWIND.

00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:53,697
      <i> AND MIKE DIDN'T LET</i>      
  <i> THE OPPORTUNITY PASS HIM BY.</i> 

475
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,900
 WE HAD SO MANY CUSTOMERS, I HAD
  TO DO AN ADDITIONAL SEATING.  

476
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:59,503
   I LEFT THE DINER ORIGINAL.   
I WANTED TO KEEP IT NINE STOOLS.

477
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,439
    SO WE ADDED ON THIS TENT,   
        AND IT SEATS 11--       

478
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:02,807
     MORE THAN WHAT WE HAVE     
          IN THE DINER.         

479
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,708
    <i> NOW MOST OF HIS REGULARS</i>   
     <i> CAME FROM THE REFINERY</i>

482

 THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CHANGED 
     SOME REGULATIONS ABOUT     

483
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,649
   THE REFINERIES--THEY DIDN'T  
  WANT PEOPLE TO GO IN AND OUT. 

484
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,785
        <i> BUT THAT DIDN'T</i>        
         <i> STOP MIKE...</i>          
             THANK YOU, BROTHER.

485
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:16,787
  SINCE THEY CAN'T COME TO ME,  
    WE JUST BRING IT TO THEM.   

486
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:20,057
      I HAD TO GO PURCHASE      
        A LUNCH TRUCK...        
                   HOW'D YOU DO?
                   HOW'D YOU DO?

487

      UP HERE TWICE A DAY.

                   GOT TWO MORE.

489
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,664
 AND THEN SOMEONE JUST ASKED ME 
ONE TIME, "DO YOU DO CATERING?" 
         <i> HE DOES NOW.</i>          

490
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:29,667

                 OKAY, LET'S GO.

    STORAGE CONTAINER THERE.

497
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:46,817
