00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:03,735
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out

00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:06,672
 looking for America's greatest 
  diners, drive-ins, and dives.

6
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:12,411
  I like me a tender hog foot.  
              -Yes.             

7
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:14,412
 ...and some hearty homecooking.

8
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:15,614
         I'd eat that every day.

9
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:18,750
     Check out these monster    
     chops in San Antonio...    

10
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:20,219
     Holy moly!

They're gonna flock-o           
   for this taco.               

13

Dude, that's righteous.         

17
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:35,968
     That's all right here,

   So, I'm here in New Orleans  
        on Broad Street,        

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,719
        just a few blocks       
         away from Canal        

23
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,922
   that'll take you right down  
         to the Quarter.        

24
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:58,390
      Listen, I love coming     
          to this city.         

25
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:02,060
  You got great people, amazing 
 food, all kinds of characters, 

26

       you got the party,       
      you got the history,      

27
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,630
      and listen, I'm here      
      to check out a joint      

28
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,399

29
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:10,735
     This is Marjie's Grill.    

30
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,337
              Charred pig tail  
               in the window.   

31
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:14,006
     I love this restaurant.    

32
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:15,941
              Fresh cracklings

33
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:17,476
    Nothing like it in town.    

34
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:19,812
        Southeast Asian Southern
    barbecue is what we call it.

35
00:01:19,814 --> 00:01:21,146
  FIERI: And it's what you get  

36
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:23,081
       when Marcus Jacobs       
       and Caitlin Carney       

37
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,016
  travel through Southeast Asia 

38

              and Lao flavors.  

41
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:35,627
Well, you guys are just         
 gigantic copycats.             

42
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,162
   This is crazy.               

43
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:39,430
  It's new. I think he invented 
   a whole new genre of food.   

44
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,432
     FIERI: And apparently,     
      a whole new language.     

45

47
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:45,370
             -Honey.            
             -Honey.            

48
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:46,371
            -Butter.            
            -Butter.            

49
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:48,173
           -Yardbird.           
     -Honey butter yardbird.    

50
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:50,042
       My favorite chicken      
         in New Orleans.        

51
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:52,844
   Ah, man. It's the smoke --   
     the grill in the back.     

52
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:56,181
   It's got this amazing chili  
   and herb sauce with garlic.  

53
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:57,448
       You can't beat it.       

54
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,917
      This is the chicken spice.
             This is what we use

55
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,252
              to rub our honey  
              butter yardbird.  

56
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:01,452
    Let's see it.               

57
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,255
                First, we go    
             salt, black pepper,

58
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:05,056
           paprika, white pepper
               right there...   

59
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:07,125
             -Okay.             
-...garlic powder, onion powder.

60
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,060
            -Japones?           
  -It's like a Japanese chili.  

61
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,596
                  Add dried     
             Vietnamese chilies.

62
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:12,698
   Oh, I'm sorry.               
  Did I miss this?              

63
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,932
              The slogan, man.  

64
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:17,402
     Marjie's --                
"A rad place to jam."           

65
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:18,804
That's the best line ever.      

66
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:21,206
         Now we're gonna butcher
      the chicken -- spatchcock.

67
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,441
But you did it down the breast  
and not down the back.          

68
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:24,809
                  Correct.      
                  This way,     

69
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,211
           it gets a lot of that
   smoke flavor in the breast...

70
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:28,213
             -Okay.             
   -...from the grill outside.  

71
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:29,614
       -This is the setup.      
             -Yeah.             

72
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,016
     So, we're just gonna put it
                right on here   

73
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:33,952
    over our burning oak logs --
          about two hours or so.

74
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:36,287
      Love it.                  
Only in New Orleans.            

75
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,223
      All right, next up...     
      -A chili garlic sauce     

76
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:40,091
     to serve alongside it.     
           -I dig it.           

77
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:42,494
           We add some shallots.
       So, these get pounded up.

78
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,030
            -Next...            
      -The garlic, chilies,     

79
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:49,034
       raw Louisiana cane sugar,
     lime juice, and fish sauce.

80
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:51,570
 All that together.             

81
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:54,572
I'll have that on any...        
      bath mat.                 

82
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,908
          So, we got our chicken
  all glazed up here with honey,

83
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,578
           butter, and some more
          of that chicken spice.

84
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,646
Okay. And this is one of        
the staples of the house.       

85
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,048
                 Definitely.    

86
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,449
       This is my favorite thing
         that we ever cook here.

87
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:06,518
                Some of that    
             chili garlic sauce.

88
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,319
            And it gets finished
  with a little French sea salt.

89
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:11,590
                     ♪♪

I'll tell you what --           
 that's good eatin'.            

91
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:15,594
 I got a sweet glaze            
 and smoke taking me            

92
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:17,729
into great Southern chicken,    
and all of a sudden,            

93
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:20,732
I come into fish sauce

94
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,334
                    Yeah.       
            And, I mean, I think

95
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:24,536
               that it bridges  
         the Louisiana influence

96
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,404
              and the Southeast 
              Asian influence.  

97
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,540
I don't know how much           
   it bridges it,               

98
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:33,078
as much as it creates           
its own new superhighway.       

99
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,014
  This garlic sauce             
 should be bottled.             

100
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:38,550
This chicken -- you get         
the heat, you get the sweet,    

101
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,620
you get the vinegar, you get    
the spice, you get the salt.    

102
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:44,223
You're setting people up to be  
disappointed next time          

103
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:46,158
  they have to eat              
just regular smoked chicken.    

104
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,626
Dude, that's righteous.         

105
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:50,295
It should say, "A rad place

109

           you dip it           
 and you just keep coming back. 

110
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,835
     You know, you can spend    
   about three hours in here.   

111
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,304
        I ain't lying --        
        I did it before.        

112
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:01,106
   MAN #2: I come to Marjie's   
        because it feels        

113
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:02,841
  like you're at a dinner party 
          every night.

         She passed away

116
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:07,912
       and we just wanted       
          to honor her.         

117
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,381
   -What a cool way to do it.   
             -Yeah.             

118
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:11,650
   We got Som Tam               
with a knuckle chicken quarter. 

119
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:13,719
   MAN #2: I always tell people,
           you just got to come,

120
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:16,387
 you got to sit down, and eat --
          it's gonna be amazing.

121
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,790

        have never tried        

122

           Crispy pork knuckles.

124
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:24,195
 There's fish sauce             
on the knuckles and fresh herbs 

125
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,865

find with Southern cuisine.     

126
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,600
 All right, brother.            
Tell me all about it.           

127
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:29,735

00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:30,802

00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:32,070

130
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:34,339
      -Get rid of the funk.     
         -A little salt.        

131
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,007
 While that's going, we're gonna
          make ourselves a nice,

132
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,277
  flavorful, crawfish-boil-style
     braise to cook the feet in.

133
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,678
We got three gallons of water...
            -Got it.            

134
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,547
              ...our soy sauce, 
                fish sauce...   

135
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,082
Copious amounts of garlic.      

136
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:47,018
   ...cut lemons, dried chilies,
             Japones, of course.

139
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,156
                    Yeah.       
        That's Louisiana citrus.

140
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:53,358
       Some onions, and...      
         -Crawfish boil.        

141
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,992
 -Crawfish boil seasoning, yes. 
            -Got it.            

142
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,160
           We're gonna simmer it

143
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,829
      for, like, 20, 30 minutes,
              strain this out,  

144
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:59,765
             and then cook them 
            in the flavored boil

145
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,232
                for about two   
        and a half, three hours.

146
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,568
  -I like me a tender hog foot. 
              -Yes.             

147
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,903
       Yeah, you don't want them
                  al dente.     

148
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,038
And then, we'll drop            
    in the fryer.               

149
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,505

150
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,374
          hit them with a little
                  black pepper. 
Fresh cracked.                  

151
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,443
     This is a mix of fish sauce
               and lime juice.  

152
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:12,644
             This is cane syrup.

00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,112

155
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,515
          and a little cilantro.

00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:18,984
Oh, you should smell it.

 What kind of food?             

228
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,101
  Well, I mean, we're a sandwich
            shop based on fun...

229
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,503
       Right.                   

230
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:53,238
       ...and trying to make big
     flavors, make people happy.

231
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,639
         There's weird,         
   quirky things on the menu,   

232
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,242
but it's all executed perfectly.

233
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:58,910
      Two headcheese tacos.     

234

      The hog's head tacos      
      are crunchy and spicy     

235
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:05,116

       hog's head cheese.       

236
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:06,517

239
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,056
All right, so we've got         
this beautiful hog head.        

240
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,192
              We're gonna go in 
        with some water, celery,

241
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:16,261
       onions, carrots...       
            -Got it.            

242
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:18,663
              ...onion powder,  
             granulated garlic, 

243
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,199
                white pepper,   
   black pepper, chili powder...

244
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:23,468
             -Okay.             
    -...Korean chili flakes,    

245
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,503
                  paprika,      
              mustard powder... 

246
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,272
   Copious amounts              
     of garlic.                 

247
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:29,474
                ...hot sauce,   
          and a little bay leaf.

248
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:32,076
First, get it rolling and then  
drop it down to a simmer.       

249
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:35,613
             10 to 12 hours and 
      it should be falling apart

250
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,216
                  and ready     
              to pick the meat. 

251
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:40,819
So, we've been standing here    
 for 10 to 12 hours.            

252
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:44,555
     Boy, are my legs tired.    
  -Yeah, and my stove is tired. 

253
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,291
 Boy, we almost ran             
   out of propane.              

254
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:48,360
                   Yeah...      
       and things to talk about.

255

      Exactly.                  
    [ Whistles ]                

256
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:52,029
  So, the way you know it's done
              is when the ears  

257
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:52,998
         are totally broken down

258
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,499
              and you can pull  
              the back jaw out. 

259
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:57,101
Right. Okay. Got it.            
That's usually my d--           

260
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,369
  uh, when I pull the jaw out.  
      -We've got the meat.      

261
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,505
       We also have reduced down
              all that liquid.  

262
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:02,240
                We chopped up   
               some mirepoix.   

263
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:03,241
            Some sherry vinegar.

             Korean chili flake.

265
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,511
            Some Creole mustard.
                Kosher salt.    

266
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:08,313
   Fresh, ground black pepper.  
        -That's the key.

00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:13,051
             Last but not least,
         we have this reduction.

269
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,386

270
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,855
            We're gonna start by
         throwing some tortillas

271
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:17,923
              on the flat top.

273
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,860
    This is gonna be an American
        cheese slice right here.

274
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:23,128
      Good man.                 

275
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,729
  Melt the cheese by steaming it
            with a little water.

276
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:25,931

281
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:32,404

284

              with mayonnaise.

341
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:30,255
               Smoked paprika.  
                  Ketchup.      

342
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:32,256
   Let me guess --              
 Korean chili flake.            

343
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,257
             Korean chili flake.
                    Yeah.       

344
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,792
                Black pepper.   
                Kosher salt.    

345
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,127
                Finished off    
               with hot sauce.  

346
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,261
       Now we make the sandwich.

347
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,530
            We have three pieces
                of rye bread.   

348
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,265
         -Three pieces.         
         -Three pieces.         

349
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:41,733
               Middle slice is  
              the soaker slice. 

350
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:45,069
      It soaks up all the juices
        from the collard greens.

351
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,804
              Two of the slices 
                 get Swiss.     

352
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,873
     We're gonna add the collard
     greens to our sandwich now.

353
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,075
           We're gonna finish it

354
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:51,743
       with our Russian dressing
              and our coleslaw.

           and some good flavor.

450
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,430
And then, what is this?         

451
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:00,497
              That is pumpkin.  

452
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:01,833
I've made a lot of beans.       

453
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:03,434
   I've never put               
   pumpkin in it.               

454
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:06,304
           Puerto Rican beans --
        most people add pumpkin,

455
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:07,839
                and it's just   
              not any pumpkin.  

456
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:09,106
      It's Puerto Rican --      
   -It's not just any pumpkin.  

457
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,708
           Puerto Rican pumpkin.

458
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,710
   Oh, of course,               
it's Puerto Rican pumpkin.      
           Puerto Rican pumpkin.

459
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:13,845
 That's all I carve             
    at Halloween.               

460
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:15,379
          Add some tomato sauce.

461
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,649
       Top it with water so that
   it can boil for a little bit.

462
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:19,583
              Dry pinto beans.  

463
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,718
             -Right.            
             -Salt.             

464
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,787
          More sofrito.         
       -Green bell pepper.      

465
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,855
         -And the onion.        
   -How long is this gonna go?  

466
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:27,592
       -For about an hour.      
     -And then what happens?    

467
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,328
       We're gonna add that brew
            to our cooked beans.

468
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,930
And that's just the beans,      
just as a side dish?            

469
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,198
          -Just -- yes.         
         -A lot of work.        

470
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,000
              Now we're making  
               the pork roast.  

471
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:37,135
            We call it pernil --

472
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:38,803
              very traditional  
               in Puerto Rico.  

473
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:42,807
           We have salt, garlic,
           pepper, oregano, oil.

474
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,942
          Rub the pork.         
              -Wow.             

475
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,079
    They're gonna go in the oven
            for about six hours.

476
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:49,080
What's our next step?           

477
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:51,082
              A Hatch red chili 
               for our nachos.  

478
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:52,083
             -Hatch?            
         -Hatch -- yes.         

479
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:53,217
                 And that's     
              not Puerto Rican, 

480
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:55,219
              but my husband is 
              from New Mexico,  

481
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:57,622
              so I had to have  
         something here for him.

482
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:58,890
So, give me the rundown.        

483
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:01,092
                   This is      
          the Hatch chili puree.

484
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,427
      Salt, garlic, and oregano.

485
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,029
      And a little bit of water.

486
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:07,632
    And then, it's going to boil
             until it thickens. 

487
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,768
And on top of these nachos,     
we're gonna use plantains?      

488
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,437
         -Yes -- fried.         
           -I like it.          

489
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,973
Now we're gonna build them --   
the Caribbean nachos.           

490
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,175
             -Okay.             
         -Add the beans.        

491
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:18,308
    Chili sauce.                

492
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,844
        Pork.                   
       Cheese.                  

493
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:21,512
     In the oven                
for about five minutes.         

494
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:22,646
         To let the cheese melt,

495
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,914
           and then bring it out
               and garnish it?  

496
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,650
        Yes.                    
  Luna Rosa sauce.              

497
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:26,851
     The recao.                 

498
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:28,920
 And there are your             
  Caribbean nachos.             

499
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:31,989
              I don't even know 
               where to start.  

500
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,125
                    Mmm!        
       The pork is super tender.

501
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:35,459
          Plantains are crunchy.

502
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:36,794
     For anybody that hasn't had
                 a plantain,    

503
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:39,997
                this would be   
   a great way to experience it.

504
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,466
          Some of the best beans
                  I've had.     

505
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:43,267
   Now, that's a different level
            right there, sister.

506
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:45,203
                Great flavors   
             and a big portion. 

507
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:47,071
                  I can see     
           why people are happy.

508
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:49,273
      Definitely the nachos     
          is my go-to.          

509
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:51,275
The pork is really, really good.

510
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:53,211
     Oh, the best, the best.    

511
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:54,812
            Ropa Vieja, table 2.

512
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:56,080
What makes the place            
     so special?                

513
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,615
     They treat you like family.

514
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:58,882
        Everybody's family here.

515
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,350
    FIERI: He's not kidding.    

516
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,855
     Iris' husband, Manuel,     
 and two sons, Amadeus and Omar,

517
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,422
  are in on the action as well. 

518
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:06,824
            WOMAN #3:           
    They invested their time,   

519
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,826
     efforts traveling back     
         to Puerto Rico         

520
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:11,228
  to get the recipes from home. 

521
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,031
             FIERI:             
   Like this beast of a meal.   

522
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:16,134
When it came in, I saw the size.
  I was just completely amazed. 

523
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:17,635
     Holy moly.                 

524
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:19,570
I don't think I've ever seen    
  a chop like that.             

525
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:22,973
It looks like a cross           
between a Halloween mask        

526
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,842
and some meat dreadlocks.       

527
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:25,910
  That's dangerous.             

528
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:26,911
  FIERI: ...when we come back.  

529
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:32,850
                     ♪♪         

530
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:35,252
       FIERI: At Luna Rosa      
     in San Antonio, Texas,     

531
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:38,456
   former teacher Iris Ornelas  
     is schooling the locals    

532
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,257
          on authentic          
      Puerto Rican cooking.     

533
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,526
             Cuban with sweets. 

534
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:43,060
           I always kept telling
                 my husband,    

535
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,195
    "I want to own a restaurant.
              I want to cook."  

536
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,664
 So, you always had             
the restaurant in your head.    

537
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,199
                  Yes, yes.     

538
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:50,934
    So, she left her 25-year    
teaching career and went for it.

539
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:53,004
              So, I went home,  
         told my husband, and --

540
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:54,205
"Hey, guess what, honey?        

541
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:55,339
    We're in the                
restaurant business."           

542
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:56,807
             Yes. "We're opening
               a restaurant."   

543
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,209
      And they're going big     
         with this dish.        

544
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,744
      The Chuleta Kan-Kan.      

545
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:01,946
     WOMAN #3: This is like     

546
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:04,015
         the Flintstone         
  brontosaurus-type pork chop.  

547
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:06,150
  MAN #6: Once you mix it with  
  the white rice and the beans, 

548
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:08,352
            it's like           
    a perfect, perfect plate.   

549
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:10,221
            We are going to make
              Chuleta Kan-Kan.  

550
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:11,756
             -Okay.             
    -It's the big pork chop.    

551
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,290
     Holy moly.                 

552
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,092
I don't think I've ever seen    
  a chop like that.             

553
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,560
                    Yeah.       
            They're very unique.

554
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:17,895
You've got the pork chop.       

555
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:19,830
  This is the back.             
Now you come down the side.     

556
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,232
        Here's your ribs.       
         -That's a rib.         

557
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:22,500
        Wow.                    

558
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:24,034
This thing is just riddled      
    with flavor.                

559
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:27,572
The only challenge to this      
is how to cook this all together

560
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:30,073
and not have these loins        
become dry by the time          

561
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:32,843
     these sides                
and rib areas become tender.    

562
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,179
               So, that's why   
               we brine them.   

563
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:37,648
            Add salt.           
    -Just a tiny bit of salt.   

564
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,583
              -Yes.             
-So, these are brined overnight.

565
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,319
             Next, we are going 
               to season them.  

566
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:42,787
              Salt and oregano. 

567
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,655
                Garlic salt.    
                  Sofrito.      

568
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,257
          And then oil.         
             -Okay.             

569
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:47,992
       And why                  
 are we making two?             

570
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:49,860
       Well, I guess one for you
               and one for me.  

571
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,129
 Sounds good to me.             

572
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:52,729
      Okay, so now, we are going
             to add the annatto,

573
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,932
                 especially     
               around the edge  

574
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:58,602
     because we want the annatto
   to make the skin very crispy.

575
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:02,139
The annatto seed is ground up   
to make the achiote powder      

576
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:06,143
   to give a nice,              
beautiful, red hue to this.     

577
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,812
     Then, we're gonna bake them
          for 15 minutes at 350.

578
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,279
  For 15 minutes --             
     that's it?                 

579
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:12,016
       Because then, after that,
           we fry them to order.

580
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:13,217
           Let's see it, sister.

581
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:15,552
IRIS: We're gonna eat this      
pork chop with white rice.      

582
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,688
     Garnish it                 
  with some recao.              

583
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,556
      The beans                 
  with the pumpkin.             

584
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:20,757
  Sweet plantains.              

585
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,893
     Garnish it                 
  with chimichurri.             

586
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,161
And you're ready to go.         

587
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,230
         When are the other guys
               gonna show up?   

588
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:27,431
The ones that are gonna         
share this with you?            

589
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:28,899
             -Yeah.             
         -I don't know.         

590
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,501
 -The rest of the football team.
     -You need to call them.    

591
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:34,638
                     ♪♪         

592
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,907
        Well, I'll tell you this
            right off the bat --

593
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,243
              that's dangerous. 

594
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:40,511
         Chimichurri's dynamite.

595
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,647
    The presentation, of course,
                 is amazing.    

596
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:46,317
            The meat on the bone
        surrounded by the fat...

597
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,652
                    Mmm.        

598
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:49,120
         When you can get a bite
              of the pork chop  

599
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:53,257
            and the...chicharrón
                all together,   

600
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:54,792
             that's prime time. 

601
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:56,327
                    Mmm!        

602
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:58,195
       But I don't even know why
       you go to all that effort

603
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,598
             to serve that pork 

604
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,868
                when the rice   
            and beans are money.

605
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,271
 This just wrecks rice and beans
        for every other culture.

606
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:09,340
                    Mmm!        
         I'd eat that every day.

607
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:10,807
             I've been to a lot 
               of restaurants.  

608
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,209
       I've never seen that cut.

609
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,477
               I've never seen  
             that presentation. 

610
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:16,146
         It's fantastic.        
           -All right!          

611
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:19,550
    MAN #4: It's crunchy, yet   
  the inside is full of flavor. 

612
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,819
 How they do it, I have no idea.

613
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:23,421
Mofongo seafood mix!            

614
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,289
  MAN #7: You know what you're  
          getting here          

615
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,024
     is delivered with love     
        from Puerto Rico,       

616
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:28,159
     and it's very evident.     

617
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:31,495
           For a Medical Imaging
             graduate, mother...

618
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:32,563
     A teacher.                 

619
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,366
    ...teacher turned restaurant
               owner and chef,  

620
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:37,501
               you definitely,  
      definitely did that right.

621
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,903
     Thank you.                 

622
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,306
 So, was this a great road trip 
            or what?            

623
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:43,707
      But don't you worry.      

624
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,377
I got plenty more joints to find
     all over this country.     

625
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:47,712
     I'll be looking for you    
            next time           

626
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:50,781
           on "Diners,          
       Drive-Ins & Dives"!      

627
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:52,183
              Okay.             
    -I'm gonna wash my hands.   

628
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:53,384
So, first we're gonna           
cook off the funk...            

629
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:55,252
            -Mm-hmm.            
 -Oh, I got it, Cap -- I got it!

630
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,920
          You just go!          
     -Thanks. Appreciate ya!    

631
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,923
       Right. So, boil it       
   and then add the spaghetti   

632
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:01,626
 with the eggs and the cupcake. 
             Got it!
