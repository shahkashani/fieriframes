1
00:00:01,869 --> 00:00:03,802
   Hey, there. I'm Guy Fieri,   
      and we're rolling out     

2
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:07,005
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

3
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:08,173
          This trip...          

4
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:09,408
      Pica'pun.                 

5
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,076
       ...we got to watch       
         what we say...         

6
00:00:11,112 --> 00:00:12,211
What was that again?            

7
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:14,013
     ...'cause we're getting    
        a little fresh...       

8
00:00:14,148 --> 00:00:15,547
               Schweinebauch.   
   Schweinebauch.               

9
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:17,349
   ...in Portland, Oregon.      

10
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:19,551
  This is gonna get             
      gnar-ly.                  

11
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,086
   The German sausage stop...   

12
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:22,554
              Whoa. whoa, whoa, 
                 whoa, whoa!    

13
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,356
         ...cranking out        
       real-deal links...       

14
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,424
       It's like he's wrestling 
          an orange anaconda.   

15
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,094
 ...with beyond-authentic cuts. 

16
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:30,896
 Expect this at the Fieri house 
         for Christmas.         

17
00:00:30,965 --> 00:00:33,565
      And in San Francisco,     
          California...         

18
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:34,900
     Go get 'em.                
 I'll be back here.             

19
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:36,368
    ...a Venezuelan joint...    

20
00:00:36,437 --> 00:00:38,303
   A little bit of Venezuela,   
 a little bit of San Francisco. 

21
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:40,039
  ...taking on my taste buds... 

22
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:40,973
         <i> Outrageous</i> outrageous.

23
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:43,442
  ...and working my vocabulary. 

24
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:44,977
                  Cachapa.      
      Exactly.                  

25
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:46,378
  Time to cachapa.              

26
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:50,515
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

27
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:52,418
         on "Triple D."         

28
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:06,932
          So, I'm here          
     in Northern California     

29
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:09,468
  in one of my favorite cities, 
         San Francisco.         

30
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:11,603
     Now, it's been a while     
         since we've had        

31
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:13,939
    the Venezuelan specialty,   
      arepas, on the show.      

32
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,207
  You know, we're talking about 
   those grilled corn pockets   

33
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,542
 that are stuffed with goodness.

34
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,344
     So you know I am stoked    
           to find out          

35
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:20,879
           right here           
    in the Mission District,    

36
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:23,015
         there's a joint        
   that's rocking the arepas.   

37
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,816
       This is Pica Pica.       

38
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:26,685
                  We got        
           a pulled-pork arepa. 

39
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:28,753
 This is one of the only things 
          that I crave.         

40
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:30,222
              Nachos Pica Pica. 

41
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:31,689
           Vegeteriana cachapa. 

42
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:34,760
I'll eat everything on the menu,
             twice.             

43
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,761
             FIERI:             
    That's music to the ears    

44
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:39,631
        of Caracas native       
      Adriana Lopez Vermut,     

45
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,033
   the rockin' chef and owner   

46
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:44,436
   who opened her first place   
      with her dad in '08.      

47
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:47,973
      And now they dish out     
   this killer Venezuelan food  

48
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,909
 at three of their NorCal spots.

49
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,312
      I never even thought      
     to try Venezuelan food,    

50
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,913
            and it's            
    one of my favorites now.    

51
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:55,981
       FIERI: No doubt --       

52
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,715
  when it means getting to eat  

53
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,184
    this corn-pocket wonder.    

54
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,518
               Arepa Pabellón!  

55
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:01,787
   FIERI: Arepa...              

56
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:02,721
                  Pabellón.     

57
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,822
      Pabellón.                 
                   Uh-huh.      

58
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,259
              We're gonna make  
                  the beef.     

59
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:08,594
                That's called   
              <i> "carne mechada."</i> 

60
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:09,728
      <i> Carne...</i>                 

61
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:10,996
                  <i> Mechada.</i>     

62
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:12,731
      <i> Mechada.</i>                 
           It means "shredded." 

63
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:15,000
            So, we're gonna add 
            our cilantro...     

64
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:16,135
            onions...           

65
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,336
            red peppers...      

66
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,004
            garlic...           

67
00:02:19,073 --> 00:02:20,072
            salt...             

68
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:22,407
            ...beef.            

69
00:02:22,443 --> 00:02:24,409
 What kind of beef?             
                  Chuck.        

70
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:26,144
     Okay.                      
               And then water.  

71
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,079
   And that's it?               

72
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:28,279
               And that's it.   

73
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,682
           And that will boil   
         for a good four hours. 

74
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:31,749
  Just let it beef.             

75
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:32,751
                Let it beef.    

76
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,487
                Then we go --   
               We tackle that.  

77
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:37,089
            The Pabellón sauce. 
      Pabellón.                 

78
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,092
      All right. Oil.           

79
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:43,428
This is where we're gonna start 
with our sofrito.               

80
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,363
                Sofrito base.   
              You know sofrito? 
 Oh, I love sofrito.            

81
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:46,798
 Onion.                         

82
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,301
 Garlic.                        

83
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,969
 Green onions.                  

84
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,372
              Red bell pepper.  
    Okay.                       

85
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,574
       Sugarcane. We really like
        to cook with sugarcane. 

86
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:57,309
Natural sugar?                  
                    Yeah.       
           It's better for you. 

87
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:59,044
                   Cumin.       

88
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:00,845
          Worcestershire sauce. 
What was that again?            

89
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:03,582
        Salsa Inglesa. You know 
     how we call it in Spanish? 
I know Salsa Inglesa, yeah.     

90
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:04,716
Worcestershire sauce --         

91
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:06,585
           'cause, believe me,  
           nobody can say that. 

92
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,119
        No one can say it       
  in the United States anyway.  

93
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:09,787
     Hot sauce?                 
                   Pica'pun.    

94
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:10,722
                   Pica'pun.    

95
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,191
 What is pica'pun?              
                      Taste it. 

96
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:14,526
         You'll find out.       
   It's our signature hot sauce.

97
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:15,460
      Ohh.                      

98
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:16,461
                 Mm.            

99
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,997
             You want to lick it
                while I cook?   

100
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,066
                  Mustard.      

101
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:23,869
                  Salt.         

102
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:24,936
Ketchup.          Ketchup.      

103
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:26,337
                  And tomatoes. 

104
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:29,074
  So, we're gonna let this cook 
     for about another hour?    

105
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:30,142
                  Yeah.         

106
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,745
 Our beef is ready.             
                        Yep.    

107
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:36,815
   So, now we're gonna just pour
     the beef onto the sauce.   

108
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:43,021
So, we're gonna let this cook   
  for another hour?             
                   Mm-hmm.      

109
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:45,490
    And meanwhile, we'll make   
  the arepa while it's cooking? 

110
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,491
                   Uh-huh.      
     All right.                 

111
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:49,628
       So, you take warm water. 

112
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:51,163
                    Salt.       
        Yes.                    

113
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:53,832
        This is the ingredient  
        for Venezuelans.        

114
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:57,102
  A little bit of corn flour -- 
                Harina P.A.N.   
        Okay.                   

115
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:58,837
        Vegetable shortening.   

116
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,972
And do you eyeball this?        

117
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:02,107
                It's by feel.   

118
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,575
             And now it's ready.

119
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,110
         Okay.                  
So, now what do we do?          

120
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:09,314
         First, make the balls. 

121
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,249
  Look at the size              
   of this thing.               

122
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:12,784
                That's good.    
        Okay.                   

123
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,919
        Now we got them formed. 

124
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:17,089
           They're formed,      
     and now let's go cook them.

125
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,658
           So, you just put them
              on the flattop.   

126
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:23,261
   Okay.                        
             A little crust on. 

127
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:27,732
     Then you transfer that     
 over to the grill to mark them.

128
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,534
              Let's plate one.  

129
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,804
                So, first,      
           you have your pocket.

130
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,505
  Black bean paste.             
                    Okay.       

131
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,275
  Then our fabulous             
   carne mechada.               

132
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:38,610
     Tajadas --                 
  sweet plantains.              

133
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:40,879
             A little sweetness 
             with the plantain. 
   Uh-huh.                      

134
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:42,647
   And then you sprinkle it     
   with<i> queso fresco</i>            

135
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:44,215
   which is                     
   a little bit of salt.        

136
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:46,618
   And this is                  
   the Venezuela in a pocket,   

137
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,387
   arepa Pabellón.              

138
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,225
 You bite into this and you get 
    the exterior, the crunch,   

139
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:56,361
           and then it's creamy,
            and really creamy.  

140
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:58,296
                  Mmm.          

141
00:04:58,332 --> 00:05:00,432
                 Wow.           
       I've had a lot of arepas.

142
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:01,700
         That's the biggest one 
                 by far.        

143
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:03,702
              But that meat --  
              it's outrageous.  

144
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:07,572
             The depth of flavor
                 in this --     

145
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:10,375
   You get sweet, you get tang, 
           you get sour.        

146
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:11,710
             And then you clean 
                 your palate    

147
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,712
              with a little bit 
                of this slaw.   

148
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,480
              I don't know      
         what to tell you, girl.

149
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:17,315
             That's outrageous. 

150
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:19,384
              I mean, like,     
         <i> outrageous</i> outrageous.

151
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,652
  WOMAN: It's the right amount  
of sweet, a little bit of spice.

152
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:24,356
    And then the<i> queso fresco</i>   
     is the perfect finish.     

153
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,727
  FIERI: And there's no reason  
      to sit out this meal,     

154
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:31,262
    'cause the whole menu --    
           get this --          

155
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:32,397
         is gluten-free.        

156
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,132
        It's gluten-free        
      without manipulation.     

157
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:35,801
       You can come here,       
          get something         

158
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:37,602
         that was meant         
       to taste this way,       

159
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,871
     and also enjoy the fact    
     that it's good for you.    

160
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,541
       FIERI:                   
I'm in San Francisco            

161
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:44,543
 hanging at a funky little joint
        called Pica Pica        

162
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:46,945
having some fantastic           
  Venezuelan food.              

163
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,814
      I don't know              
that I can eat any more,        

164
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:50,949
  but I can assure you          
that when you come back,        

165
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:52,417
 she's gonna make me            
      eat more.                 

166
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:53,919
    I'll see you                
  in a little bit.              

167
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,029
    Welcome back.               

168
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,365
 This is "Triple D" hanging out 
 at Pica Pica in San Francisco. 

169
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:08,566
What are we into now?           

170
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:10,168
                  Cachapa.      
      Exactly.                  

171
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,403
      Time to cachapa.          

172
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,574
       It's a sweet corn crepe. 
    Okay.                       

173
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,842
             Now the sweet corn.

174
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,512
        Okay.                   
                Corn flour --   
                Harina P.A.N.   

175
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:22,914
           Then sugar and salt. 
   Okay.                        

176
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,248
   So, you'll notice,           
   no water.                    

177
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:25,717
  Got it.                       
            It's a pretty thick 
                 batter, uh?    

178
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,419
              And then the corn 
              has its juice.    

179
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:33,525
So, the batter's done,          

180
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:35,393
 and that'll make               
   the cachapa?                 
                  That's right. 

181
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:36,728
         But before we do that? 

182
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,130
        We've gonna be making   
     the marinade for the tofu. 

183
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:40,432
  Venezuelan tofu?              

184
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:43,134
   A little bit of Venezuela,   
 a little bit of San Francisco. 

185
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,669
         People here<i> love</i> tofu. 

186
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:46,738
       That's how it works      
  here at Pica Pica. All right. 

187
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,272
                  Cilantro.     

188
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:49,340
                White onion.    

189
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:50,541
                Dry oregano.    

190
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:51,609
                   Thyme.       
        Whoa.                   

191
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,545
        Bay leaves, comino.     

192
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:54,279
      Nice.                     

193
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,681
     Black pepper, salt, honey. 

194
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:58,417
    And?                        
              Red wine vinegar. 

195
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:00,017
  Red wine vinegar?             
                      Mm-hmm.   

196
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:02,888
This is all the marinade        
    for the tofu?               
                    That's it.  

197
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,089
        Okay.                   
                 All right.     

198
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,891
     Go get 'em.                
 I'll be back here.             

199
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:15,500
             After this is done,

200
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:18,904
     we're gonna put it in the  
   Vitamix so that it's pureed. 

201
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:24,309
 Girl, you can make some sauces 
         and marinades.         

202
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,510
      Wow!                      

203
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:28,446
      Now the pressed tofu      
  goes down into the marinade.  

204
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:30,382
 Oh, that's awesome.            

205
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:32,250
  How long's it go?             
                 Overnight.     

206
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:35,253
And this gets served            
  inside of the...              
                     Cachapa.   

207
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:36,655
                 All right.     
                Let's do it.    
  Let's go.                     

208
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:40,658
         You take your<i> muñequita</i>
              batter down.      

209
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:43,094
       So cachapa's being made. 
         Let's grill the tofu.  

210
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,397
               Sizzle, sizzle.  

211
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:48,266
               You can see      
         everything dances here.

212
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:49,935
    Come on down                
for the dancing tofu.           

213
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,802
So, grill both sides?           
                         Yep.   

214
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,204
       Then we put it together? 

215
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:55,173
           And then we're gonna 
                assemble it.    
   Very nice.                   

216
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,678
   First, we put a little bit of
          <i> ensalada verde</i>       

217
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,013
             with a little bit  
           of house vinaigrette.

218
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:03,348
              So, then we have  
                our cachapa.    

219
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,615
       Crazy.                   
                   Crazy.       

220
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,419
   First off, black bean paste, 
       which we call<i> moreno.</i>    

221
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:09,320
                Garlic aioli.   

222
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:11,222
               Then you take    
           your grilled tofu... 

223
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:13,158
             sweet plantains... 

224
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,293
                your avocado.   

225
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:16,228
      Geez.                     

226
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:17,262
                   Voilà.       

227
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,301
      Wow.                      

228
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,703
   That is crazy.               

229
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:25,737
                  Isn't it?     

230
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:28,073
   The cachapa...               

231
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,843
...on the sweeter side,         
but really nice texture         

232
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:34,913
 in that you can taste the corn 
        being ground up.        

233
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:36,314
    Kind of like                
    a corn salad.               

234
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:38,316
     But then you get           
a little bit of the crisp,      

235
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:40,519
a little bit of the burnt,      
 a little bit of the char       

236
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:43,655
  kind of like you roasted corn 
         on a barbecue.         

237
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:45,256
     The tofu's                 
   nice and meaty.              

238
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,392
 My sister was a big vegetarian,
        my sister Morgan.       

239
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,394
 This would be the kind of dish 
         she would love.        

240
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:51,663
There's great texture.          
  There's uniqueness.           

241
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:52,998
There's depth of flavor.        

242
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,965
 That's outrageous.             

243
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:02,406
Sweet and crispy on the outside,
    yet gooey on the inside.    

244
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:05,343
I got to tell you, girl,        
an outrageous experience.       

245
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,278
                  Awesome.      
The food's dynamite.            

246
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,214
Your personality                
is bouncing off the screen.     

247
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,149
I mean, you've got              
three of these joints.          

248
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,218
People are gonna be lining up   
to come find them               

249
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:14,719
   because it is                
   the real deal.               

250
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,426
       FIERI: Coming up...      

251
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:22,427
It's a meat slam dunk.          

252
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,362
         ...we're headed        
     to Portland, Oregon...     

253
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:26,497
                Hit it, boss.   
   ...for serious sausages...   

254
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,767
It's like the Iron Man          
    sausage maker.              

255
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:31,102
 ...and a big-time bologna bill.

256
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:33,638
Bologna's a nice, fine,         
     blended meat.              

257
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,240
     You should have almost had 
            an ascot on.        

258
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,275
                Bologna is      
           a fine blended meat. 

259
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:46,384
    It's a beautiful day here   

260
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,319
      on the southeast side     
      of Portland, Oregon.      

261
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:51,188
I'm in the Brooklyn neighborhood
      to check out a joint      

262
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:54,159
      that I hear is doing      
    real-deal German sausage.   

263
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:57,963
        This is Edelweiss       
     Sausage & Delicatessen.    

264
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,199
             WOMAN: Currywurst. 

265
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,736
     Row upon row of meat --    

266
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:07,672
      salamis, liverwursts,     
         blood sausage.         

267
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:09,407
      FIERI: They've got --     
         now get this --        

268
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:14,545
   over 120 different types of  
 German sausage and lunch meat. 

269
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,214
 All their food is high-quality 
         and top-notch.         

270
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,481
      They use                  
the best ingredients.           

271
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:19,618
           It's very authentic. 
          It should be.         

272
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:22,754
  Founder George Baier grew up  
 and learned the trade in Berlin

273
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:26,090
    before opening this joint   
             in '76.            

274
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,693
             In '99,            
   he passed the sausage baton  

275
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:31,630
 to his two sons, Tony and Tom, 

276
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:33,264
    who flat-out ran with it.   

277
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,437
How many pounds of sausage      
  will you do in a year?        

278
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:41,039
     We'll do a couple thousand 
             in a week.         

279
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,974
So, it's not out of line        
 to say that you can be         

280
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,243
  at 150,000 to 200,000 pounds  
       of sausage a year?       

281
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,678
              Yeah.             

282
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:51,315
        FIERI: Including        
 one of my favorites from Italy.

283
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:54,219
  The Italian red wine salami,  
        it's just right.        

284
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,322
          So,                   
this is Italian salami.         

285
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,190
             We're gonna start  
             with the pork fat. 

286
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,124
 This is all frozen.            

287
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:02,894
  This is gonna get             
      gnar-ly.                  

288
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:11,803
                 All right.     

289
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:13,137
              Nice, fine dice.  

290
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,206
    Look at that!               

291
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,275
               We're gonna add  
               the beef to it.  
     What cuts?                 

292
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,142
               Bottom rounds.   

293
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:19,678
   Bottom rounds.               
                    Yep.        

294
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:27,818
         This is a curing salt. 

295
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,220
     Just some real fine sugar, 

296
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:32,624
   some salt, some Morton salt, 
      and then the dextrose.    

297
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:34,959
                  We'll add     
             the white pepper...

298
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,093
 Don't breathe that.            

299
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,829
         ...the ground fennel...

300
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:40,098
               black pepper...  

301
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:41,966
                whole fennel... 
        Nice.                   

302
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:44,702
        ...juniper berry...     

303
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,571
        crushed garlic...       

304
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:48,039
       whole bottle of I-talian 
       red wine.                

305
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,040
      I-talian!                 

306
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,577
              We'll hand-mix it 
                  a little,     

307
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:55,312
         make sure everything's 
           well-incorporated.   

308
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:57,315
Look at that texture.           

309
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,250
  So, we'll take it from here,  
           go to here?          

310
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:00,918
           We'll load it        
   right into the stuffer. See? 

311
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:02,187
       Stays nice and together. 

312
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:04,355
     That's it?                 
                    Yep.        
         Putting that right in. 

313
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:09,127
          Hit it, boss.         

314
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:11,563
          Synthetic casing.     

315
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:15,900
   Then we give it              
   a little clip.               

316
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:20,004
              Whoa, whoa, whoa, 
                 whoa, whoa!    

317
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,273
         Don't get your thumb in
              on that one!      

318
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,674
              That is awesome!  

319
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,610
 Is this gonna shrink up at all 
         when it hangs?         

320
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,279
  It'll lose about              
 20% of its weight.             

321
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:30,748
     The casing                 
 will pull with it.             
                      Killer.   

322
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:31,816
                  Okay.         

323
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,484
              Give this a shot. 
     All right.                 

324
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,153
   I'm gonna wear half of this. 
      I can already feel it.    

325
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:36,955
      Pull!                     

326
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:42,460
                  Perfect.      

327
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,297
                  Nice.         
         This will dry up well. 

328
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,698
              We'll hang them   
           on some smoke sticks.

329
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:49,366
So, we're on like this?         
                    Yep.        

330
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:53,103
     We'll let it cure and hang 
        for a couple of days,   

331
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,639
        and then we'll throw it 
             in the cold smoker 

332
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,374
         for probably two days.
