          This trip...          

6
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:09,874
  I feel a food coma coming on. 

7
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:12,744
          It's seafood          
     and savory smorgasbord.    

8
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,013
        Magic's about to happen.

9
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:16,348
  Like in a classic fish house  
      in North Carolina...      

10
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,617
You've kept it old-school       
and you've done it great.       

11
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:21,086

00:00:27,762 --> 00:00:29,561
            It's gonna be crazy.
         I can already tell you.

17

             we're gonna get it 
        hot enough to make food?

51
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:48,840
  Yes, absolutely.              

52
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,175
          Oh, I got to see this.

53
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:51,643
  We're gonna start             
 with a little oil,             

54
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:54,379
and a sofrito consists of some  
onions, carrots, some celery.   

55
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:55,580
                    Okay.       

56
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:56,782
Salt, a little pepper           
 and a little sugar             

57
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:59,184
to bring out natural            
sweetness of all vegetables.    

58
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:00,585
         Now where did you learn
                  to cook?      

59
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,588
Uh, I went to Pennsylvania      
Culinary in Pittsburgh.         

60
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,255
      Is that where you're from?

61
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:04,590
Philadelphia, I'm from.         

62
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:05,590
 Born and raised.               
                    Love Philly.

63
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:06,925
                 Shout-out.     
             What's up, Philly? 

64
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:09,928
We'll add some bay leaf,        
  parsley, chives,              

65
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,197
   tarragon, dill,              
  Spanish paprika.              

66
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,331
            Sweat all this down.

67
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,466
                Let it cool?    
        Yep.                    

68
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,535
                So these are    
           the beautiful shrimp.

69
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:18,870
       I mean, that's too pretty
           to make into a patty.

70
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,338
We'll peel these right up.      
                      Okay.     

71
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,141
They're gonna get thrown        
in the food processor.          

72
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:24,743
The cooked sofrito, and now,    
we're gonna buzz it up.         

73
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,010
              How do you get it 
             to stick together? 

74
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:27,412
The tackiness of the shrimp     
     kind of --                 
                     See?       

75
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:30,015
So, it's not bad once in a while
           to be a little tacky.

76
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:31,350
           [ Boing! ]           

77
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:32,884
Got some nice chunks            
   in there still.              

78
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,019
You're all mixed up.            

79
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:36,088
           Yeah, but I'm working
         through it, in therapy.

80
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,157
We're just gonna add some salt, 
a little bit of pepper,         

81
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,291
     and again,                 
a little bit of sugar.          

82
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:40,292
             You and your sugar.

83
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:41,560
 And then we'll just            
   patty them up.               

84
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:42,894
          That's the shrimp cake
             you always wanted. 

85
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,763
                  No filla.     
                All thrilla.    

86
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,965
So, next step, we're gonna make 
the apple cabbage slaw.         

87
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:48,299
  Start with extra              
  virgin olive oil,             

88
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,235
sherry maple vinegar,           
fresh-chopped thyme,            

89
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:51,570
season with a little --         
                     Guess what?

90
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:52,971
             Salt, pepper and...

91
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:54,306
          BOTH: Sugar.          

92
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:56,641
   Whisk that up,               
add our shredded cabbage.       

93
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,977
And then the fun part,          
 slicing the apples.            

94
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:00,646
          You guys really do get
           some awesome produce.

95
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:01,380
       We do.                   

96
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:02,648
I mean, with Michigan around,   

97
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,782
they're actually second         
  behind California             

98
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,450
for diversity of produce.       

99
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:06,718
                   Really?      

100
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,520
Add some butter to the flat top,
 the shrimp burger,             

101
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,655
add the bun and toast it up.    

102
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:15,594
We'll top it off with some      
hot sauce aioli, patty, slaw,   

103
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:16,861
finish it with the bun.         

104
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,263
                 Well done.     

105
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:21,866
                    Mmm.        

106
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,669
  The depth of the flavor inside
    of that patty is ridiculous.

107
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:29,140
  Not being bound by any filler,
          that's really the key.

108
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:30,475
          Acid from the cabbage,

109
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,944
  and you get a little extra fat
       coming in from the aioli.

110
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,614
      When you can get this kind
   of food in a food truck, boy,

111
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:37,882
               that's a gift.   

112
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,419
                    Mmm.        
                Right there.    

113
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:41,553
     Shrimp burger for Kyle!    

114
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,288
     Very thick, very juicy.    

115
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,556
I could go and buy shrimp       
from the same farm they use     

116
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,359
in Mason, Michigan, but it's not
gonna taste like this.          

117
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:49,027
             WOMAN:             
  We have a lot of local farms. 

118
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:51,363
   We'll see that food coming   
     out of the food truck.     

119
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:53,565
    In the winter, since it's   
 a more rooted-vegetable season,

120
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,835
   they would probably go for   
    carrots, beets, radishes.   

121
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:57,970

   part mail man.

     Mash bites for Melissa!    

127
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,046
     I love the mash bites.     

128
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:10,115
  They're fried on the outside, 
  they're gooey on the inside,  

129
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:12,451
and they like pop in your mouth.

130
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:14,186
So, it's almost like            
 a mozzarella stick,            

131
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:15,253
but with mashed potatoes.       

132
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,988
No cheese. It tastes like       
there's cheese in it.           

133
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,456
                 No cheese?     

134
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,191
First thing we'll do is, we'll  
just bloom this sheet gelatin.  

135
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,060
  Let that sit for              
  a couple minutes.             

136
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:24,662
So now we're gonna make butter  
cream sauce for the mash.       

137
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:27,265
We will add to the pot          
the cream and the butter.       

138
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,600
We'll let that simmer           
probably about an hour or so,   

139
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,935
 while you're baking            
   your potatoes.               

140
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,137
       So these are Butterballs?

141
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,072
Yeah, a local potato grown      
in Holland, Michigan.           

142
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:35,273
             Yeah, that's right.
               Where you from?  

143
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,342
             Holland, Michigan. 

144
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:38,143
                Good potato.    

145
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:39,678
So the gelatin's ready.         

146
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,079
It is a messy process.          

147
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:42,647
Squeeze out the extra liquid.   

148
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,415
 Into the reduction.            
                           Okay.

149
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:47,352
We'll just add the cream        
and the potatoes to the blender.

150
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:49,688
             What I always love 
           is filling up a mixer

that it's all pureed.

156
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,899
So we'll add some salt to this  
and just a little bit of sugar.

        Order of cevapi.        

241
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,277
        Bosnian sausages.       
                 MAN: Thank you.

242
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,281
 Bosnian sausages are the staple
       of this restaurant.      

243
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:04,749
      It feels like you're      
          walking down          

244
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:07,485
     that cobblestone street    
           in Bosnia.

    It just feels like home.    

246
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,889
    Cevapi, I'm not kidding you,
          when I was in Croatia,

247
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:13,024
          it was one of the best
       things I had when I went.

248
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,425
                    Okay,       
         what are we gonna make?

249
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:18,763
We make fresh, soft bread       
they call lepinja in Bosnia.    

250
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:20,231
            And this is gonna go
              with the cevapi?  

251
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,032
      Exactly.                  

252
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,434
               Water, flour...  

253
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:23,969
        -Salt and yeast.        
           -That's it.          

254
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:24,669
             Very simple recipe.

255
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:25,704
        Yes.                    

256
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:28,039
    I will mix it               
 about five minutes.

259
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:33,244
    So we're gonna form these up
with the semolina on the bottom.

260
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,113
             These are gonna go 
  in the oven, what temperature?

261
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:38,516
    500 degrees,                
  about 10 minutes.             

262
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,318
     And now we make the cevapi.
Now we make cevapi.             

263
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,653
      What do we got here, Chef?
We got beef chuck rolls.        

264
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:43,722
                    Okay.       

265
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:45,723
           So we take the chuck,
              we break it down. 

266
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,460
        This is a pretty rustic,
              traditional dish, 

267
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:50,261
       but if done the right way
        with simple ingredients,

268
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,997
              you're gonna get  
          an outstanding flavor.

269
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,264
              -Yes.             
       -So now we season.       

270
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:53,932
        Yes.                    
       Season.                  

271
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,133
        Salt.                   
       Pepper.                  

272
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,468
  And baking soda.              

273
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,869
                 Mix it up.     
I mix with hands.               

274
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,804
            Then we'll grind it.

275
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,205
         Mix it with some water.

276
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,741
Two eggs and mineral water.

           a little bit lighter.

278
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,278
      Exactly.                  

279
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,214
We put in the fridge overnight. 

280
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,216
   And then we'll put it through
the machine to make the sausage.

281
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,884
I put in ground beef.           

282
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,685
                 No casing.     
    Exactly.

come out as long as his hand is,

284
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,290
        and then he cleans it up
          there with the finger.

285
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,358
        Yes.

   on the grill, with the bread.

              have the onions.

      a little bit of the onion,

              But what you get,

  with how tender the meat is,  

358
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:02,120

               Of course.       

361
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:09,059
We put olive oil in,

Now we put tomato sauce,        
    tomato past,                

364

            let that cook, Chef?

369
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:28,145
   Almost 3 hours,              
and it will be perfect.         

370
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:28,946

This is a real platter?         

590
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,561
Or is this just, "Hey,          
I'm gonna see if Guy Fieri      

591
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,630
won't fit back in his Camaro?"  

592
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:27,497
               We'll try that.  

593
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,768
  Oysters, sea scallops, shrimp.

594
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,703
That's not a real amount        
     of shrimp.                 

595
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:37,441
 Clam strips, piece of flounder,
             and a deviled crab.

596
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:40,110
       Coleslaw, steamed shrimp.

597
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,879
     Holy moly!                 

598
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,717
The batter's nice and light.    

599
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,186
Seafood shines through.         

600
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,453
  Not overly oily.              

601
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:51,722
Cocktail sauce has got          
    a nice tang.                

602
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,657
You've kept it old-school       
and you've done it great.       

603
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,459
   It's delicious.              

604
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:57,261
            WAITRESS:           
      Sampler for you two.      

605
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:59,130
      Can you eat the whole     
        sampler platter?        

606
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:00,531
              -No.              
          -Okay, good.          

607
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:01,799
              'Cause I thought  
             I was the only one.

608
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:03,133
       Scallop platter up!      

609
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,468
So what we have here,           
ladies and gentlemen,           

610
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:08,339
is we have the mom and great    
aunt of Matt "The Beaver."      

611
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:10,607
   You've seen all              
the things Matt shot.           

612
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,210
  What do you think             
of this little seafood joint?   

613
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,146
       I like this place.       
They did it right?              

614
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:17,748
     They do it better than     
      any I have ever had.      

615
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,149
You know I got this on tape?    

616
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,752
Well, if Matt has -- Do you     
have tape in the camera today?  

617
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:22,620
     Okay, good.                

618
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:23,888
   MAN: I love the atmosphere.  

619
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,689
        I love the fish.        
        It's always good.       

620
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,559
You've got the right attitude,  
  the right energy,             

621
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,028
   and you do this              
with such a real-deal,          

622
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,363
straight-forward approach.      

623
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:33,197
     I enjoy it.                
                      Good.     

624
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,635
 So, that's it for this edition 
 of "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives."

625
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:41,571

       Drive-Ins & Dives."      

629
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:48,979
There's just one person         

630
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,181
standing here in the            
hush puppy department?          

631
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:51,916
           -That's it.          
 -What's it have on your résumé?

632
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,583
"Well, for the last 27 years,   
     I've worked                

633
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,319
the hush puppy department."     

634
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:57,521
          [ Laughter ]
