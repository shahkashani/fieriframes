1
00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:02,467
    Hey there. I'm Guy Fieri,   
     and we're rolling out,     

2
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:05,537
 looking for America's greatest 
  diners, drive-ins, and dives.

00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:06,671
          [theme music]         

4
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:07,740
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
           This trip--          

5
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:08,874
           [laughter]           

6
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:11,076
       --it's a Fairbanks,      
       Alaska adventure--       

7
00:00:11,112 --> 00:00:12,377
       GUY FIERI: That'll       
      stick to your bones.      

8
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:14,346
 GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): --filled
     with a world of flavor.    

9
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:17,282
  GUY FIERI: If you don't stop  
  me, I'll eat the whole thing. 

10
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:18,951
   GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): Like  
     a jamming Cuban joint--    

11
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:21,886
   GUY FIERI: Bring the whole   
 family down for this one, huh? 

12
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:23,822
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
  --classic American comfort--  

13
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:26,024
     GUY FIERI: It takes you    
    right back to a log cabin   

14
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,826
    hanging out with grandma.   

15
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:29,561
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
  --and a funky food trailer--  

16
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,896
         GUY FIERI: Wow.        

17
00:00:30,965 --> 00:00:32,564
GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): --driving
   you straight into Germany.   

18
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,099
       GUY FIERI: I'm just      
    trying to figure out how    

19
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:35,767
 to get more of it into my face.

20
00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:38,704
     That's all right here,     
      right now on "Diners,     

21
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:39,772
     Drive-Ins, and Dives."     

22
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:43,075
          [theme music]         

23
00:00:50,084 --> 00:00:52,451
         [music playing]        

24
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:55,921
So I'm here in Fairbanks, Alaska
 with the one and only Benny Lin

25
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,055
     from Pagoda Restaurant.    

26
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:58,657
      BENNY LIN: I want to      
     take you to this place.    

27
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,259
        Moi Moi, she used       
         to work for me.        

28
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:01,793
      Oh, so we're going to     
      a Chinese restaurant.     

29
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,195
               No.              

30
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:04,596
   Her friends, they partnered  
 together and opened this place.

31
00:01:04,632 --> 00:01:05,997
       She also worked at       
      the hospital before.      

32
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:07,032
               OK.              

33
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:08,400
        So it's a Chinese       
     place by the hospital.     

34
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:09,067
          - No, no, no.         
              - OK.             

35
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,002
             No, no.            

36
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:11,402
         And those two,         
       they love tequila.       

37
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,203
             They--             

38
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,272
  GUY FIERI: Wait, wait, wait.  

39
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,806
        So it's a Chinese       
   restaurant by the hospital   

40
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:15,674
      that serves tequila?      

41
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:16,742
           No, no, no.          

42
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:18,944
        They have a place       
     called Salty's On 2nd.     

43
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:20,145
     This is Salty's On 2nd.    

44
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:20,946
        I'm so confused.        

45
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:22,547
         [music playing]        

46
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,349
 MONICA KISSINGER: Crab-stuffed 
     mushrooms ready to go.     

47
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:26,151
       SALTY'S CUSTOMER 1:      
   Salty's is a great hotspot   

48
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,152
       here in Fairbanks.       

49
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:28,753
  I got a biscuit and gravy up. 

50
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:30,622
    My favorite time to come    
     here if for breakfast,     

51
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,691
   but I definitely love their  
    lunch and dinner as well.   

52
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,025
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
       But things actually      

53
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:37,295
 began with brunch, when owners 
   Vanessa Stebbins and Monica  

54
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:40,065
      Kissinger set out to      
     pair scratch-made food     

55
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:41,366
       with boozy drinks.       

56
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,168
  GUY FIERI: So Benny says this 
    is a great place to come.   

57
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:44,236
  Says you girls like tequila.  

58
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:45,637
        That's how we got       
        the name Salty's.       

59
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:47,239
    VANESSA STEBBINS: We both   
     have worked in the bar     

60
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:48,507
 business for close to 20 years.

61
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:50,842
  Just started with us wanting  
   to do something on our own.  

62
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:52,978
     Everyone in town knows     
       Monica and Vanessa.      

63
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:54,980
   SALTY'S CUSTOMER 2: I knew   
   that they'd do a great job.  

64
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:56,448
        MONICA KISSINGER:       
   Meatball subs in the oven.   

65
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:58,784
     The meatball sub, it's     
  really, really, really good.  

66
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:01,987
     Their marinara sauce is    
    just absolutely amazing.    

67
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,588
    The bread is always soft.   

68
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,190
       You definitely need      
    two hands to pick it up.    

69
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:06,124
         They are huge.         

70
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,959
   GUY FIERI: All right, chef.  

71
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:07,993
      What's the game plan?     

72
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,327
       We're going to make      
       our homemade bread       

73
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:10,862
      for the meatball sub.     
GUY FIERI: You don't bake bread.

74
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:11,663
          I cook rice.          

75
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,198
           [laughter]           

76
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:14,332
        MONICA KISSINGER:       
       We're going to put       

77
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:15,733
 the power flour into the bowl. 

78
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:17,402
     GUY FIERI: Don't let it    
    fall on the floor, Benny.   

79
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:19,238
     MONICA KISSINGER: Wheat    
   flour, granulated garlic--   

80
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,272
     GUY FIERI: Interesting.    

81
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:21,806
        MONICA KISSINGER:       
      --sugar, salt, yeast.     

82
00:02:21,876 --> 00:02:23,341
    GUY FIERI: Where did you    
      get this recipe from?     

83
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:24,409
        From my grandma.        

84
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:26,277
     We just mix it around,     
       and then I'm going       

85
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,546
 to start putting the water in. 

86
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:29,548
     GUY FIERI: Let this go     
    [inaudible] in the bowl.    

87
00:02:29,617 --> 00:02:30,615
              Yep.              

88
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,283
       Now we add oil and       
      mix it a little more.     

89
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,219
      Leave it in the bowl      
      for about 45 minutes,     

90
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:36,421
 and then it rests on the table 
  for about another 45 minutes. 

91
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:37,489
         GUY FIERI: Then        
        we'll portion it.       

92
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,224
      MONICA KISSINGER: And     
      put it in our fridge.     

93
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,159
       This is after it's       
     been sitting overnight.    

94
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:42,360
        Go ahead, Benny.        

95
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:43,295
     BENNY LIN: Gentle, huh?    
    MONICA KISSINGER: Gentle.   

96
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:44,229
     And then just roll it.     

97
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:45,030
       BENNY LIN: Oh, OK.       

98
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:45,830
     MONICA KISSINGER: Yeah.    

99
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,965
   Cornmeal, and on the tray.   

100
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,767
      Once they're proofed,     
         into the oven--        

101
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:49,701
  MONICA KISSINGER: 20 minutes. 

102
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,569
   GUY FIERI: Next, meatballs?  

103
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,170
     We got our ground pork.    

104
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:53,438
  GUY FIERI: 80-20 ground beef. 

105
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,441
      House-made bread that     
     we soak in milk, onion,    

106
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:57,976
    parsley, Parmesan cheese.   

107
00:02:58,045 --> 00:02:58,777
     GUY FIERI: A lot of it.    

108
00:02:58,846 --> 00:02:59,844
              Wow.              

109
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:01,380
     MONICA KISSINGER: Eggs,    
       granulated garlic,       

110
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,181
    fennel, pepper, and salt.   

111
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,483
        GUY FIERI: Benny,       
       go get your gloves.      

112
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:05,584
    You gotta make meatballs.   
       - All-- all right.       

113
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:06,785
           All right.           
  MONICA KISSINGER: Ball it up. 

114
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:07,719
        - Just like that?       
             - Yeah.            

115
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,254
       And it goes in our       
        oven 20 minutes.        

116
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,522
        You make your own       
        tomato sauce too?       

117
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:11,590
              Yes.              
     GUY FIERI: Everything.     

118
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:12,857
       I should just quit       
     asking if they make it.    

119
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:13,992
        MONICA KISSINGER:       
        We're gonna start       

120
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:15,594
       with the oil, fresh      
         garlic, onion,         

121
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:18,329
  pepper, oregano, salt, sugar. 

122
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,798
       GUY FIERI: Let that      
    caramelize a little bit.    

123
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,999
        MONICA KISSINGER:       
        Crushed tomatoes.       

124
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:22,201
         How long are we        
      gonna let this cook?      

125
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:23,735
  MONICA KISSINGER: Four hours. 
      - Build the sandwich.     

126
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:24,803
              Yep.              

127
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:26,138
     We take our house-made     
      bun, add a little bit     

128
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,208
 of provolone cheese, meatballs,
      marinara, mozzarella,     

129
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:31,343
  and then it goes in the oven. 

130
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:32,343
       GUY FIERI: Just to       
        melt the cheese.        

131
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,278
     MONICA KISSINGER: Yes.     

132
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:34,413
         GUY FIERI: Now         
       watch this, Benny.       

133
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:35,146
  I'll show you how to do this. 
          - I'm ready.          

134
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:35,947
           You ready?           

135
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:38,550
           [laughter]           

136
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:40,619
     BENNY LIN: Wow, Monica.    

137
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:41,820
        MONICA KISSINGER:       
    Usually calls me Moi Moi.   

138
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,622
      BENNY LIN: "Moi Moi"      
     in Chinese is "sister."    

139
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:45,023
       GUY FIERI: I gotta       
       tell you something.      

140
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:49,227
   That bread with that little  
  garlic kick, that's dynamite. 

141
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:50,428
      Meatballs are tender.     

142
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:51,630
       Got great texture.       

143
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:53,899
       Sauce is delicious,      
    this really nice tomato.    

144
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:56,301
           It's legit.          

145
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:58,103
         I mean, I could        
      easily be in an East      

146
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,771
  Coast sub shop getting this.  

147
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:00,972
      BENNY LIN: Good job.      
          - Thank you.          

148
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,241
 - Can I order that thing to go?
             - Sure.            

149
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:03,041
             Please.            

150
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,375
           Well done.           

151
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,911
     SALTY'S CUSTOMER 1: The    
 meatballs are spiced perfectly.

152
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,779
   Nice zesty marinara sauce.   

153
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:08,780
          It's killer.          

154
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:09,881
          It is killer.         

155
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:11,249
        MONICA KISSINGER:       
     Trudy's Pizza for Liz.     

156
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:13,652
 SALTY'S CUSTOMER 3: Salty's is 
  definitely my favorite place  

157
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:14,920
      to come in Fairbanks.     

158
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,521
       I'm happy to bring       
      my kids here with us,     

159
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:18,924
  but then when we want to have 
 an adult time in the evenings, 

160
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:20,191
   it's a great place to come.  

161
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:21,593
    SALTY'S CUSTOMER 4: They    
  turn this place into a club.  

162
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,128
        Vanessa's husband       
       actually is the DJ.      

163
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,262
        - It gets going.        
        - It gets going.        

164
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:25,397
           All right.           
             - Yeah.            

165
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,297
       SALTY'S CUSTOMER 5:      
     When you enter in here,    

166
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,733
        it's always very        
       warm and inviting,       

167
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:30,535
      and the food is very      
        hearty and homey.       

168
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,070
  I have your chicken pot pie.  

169
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:33,805
     SALTY'S CUSTOMER 2: The    
  gravy on the chicken pot pie  

170
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:34,673
         is my favorite.        

171
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,008
        SALTY'S CUSTOMER        
       3: I actually think      

172
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:39,010
   the amount of crust to the   
 rest of the dish is fantastic. 

173
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,144
        Chicken pot pie.        

174
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,346
      MONICA KISSINGER: We      
     start with our chicken.    

175
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:42,681
       Season it up with a      
       little bit of oil.       

176
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:46,484
   Stuff it with some butter,   
  garlic, crushed red peppers,  

177
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,887
       rosemary, salt and       
      pepper, little thyme.     

178
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:49,620
         GUY FIERI: OK.         

179
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:50,421
          In the oven.          

180
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:51,957
            350 for--           

181
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,158
        MONICA KISSINGER:       
      Hour and 15 minutes.      

182
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:54,426
      GUY FIERI: All right.     
    So we pulled the chicken.   

183
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:55,827
 We're going to make our stock. 

184
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:58,430
  Water, bones and scraps from  
the chicken that we cooked off--

185
00:04:58,565 --> 00:04:59,231
       GUY FIERI: Got it.       

186
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:00,766
   --scraps from the kitchen--  

187
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:04,302
   bay leaf, carrots, cabbage,  
     onions, garlic, celery.    

188
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:06,438
 GUY FIERI: Let this simmer down
   now four hours, five hours?  

189
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:07,239
          Seven hours.          

190
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:08,640
          Overachiever.         

191
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:09,907
   MONICA KISSINGER: Now we're  
   going to make our filling.   

192
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:13,578
     Chicken stock, carrots,    
 celery, onion, house spice mix.

193
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,579
        Add the chicken.        

194
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:16,114
      GUY FIERI: Once this      
        comes to a boil--       

195
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,849
    MONICA KISSINGER: Thicken   
     it up with our slurry.     

196
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:19,317
       GUY FIERI: And then      
     drop in your potatoes.     

197
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,118
      That'll cool it down.     

198
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,119
              Next?             

199
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:22,520
       We're going to make      
      the crust for on top.     

200
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:23,789
      Start with our lard.      

201
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:24,923
   GUY FIERI: Looks like we're  
    getting to make biscuits.   

202
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,258
         Kind of, yeah.         
       BENNY LIN: It does.      

203
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,461
     Mind your own biscuits     
     and life will be gravy.    

204
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,530
        MONICA KISSINGER:       
    Flour, salt, ice water--    

205
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,997
      GUY FIERI: She wants      
       it shortening cold       

206
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:35,667
   so the shortening will stay  
  separated inside of the flour 

207
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,335
      so when she makes it      
       it creates layers.       

208
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:38,536
               Oh.              

209
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:39,805
    MONICA KISSINGER: Roll it   
    out, cut it into circles,   

210
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,005
       put it in the oven.      

211
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,207
Then we got our pot pie filling.

212
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,608
      GUY FIERI: [whistle]      
             - Wow.             

213
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,277
    MONICA KISSINGER: Pull it   
    out, and it's ready to go   

214
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:46,812
 on top of the chicken pot pie. 

215
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:47,879
        Crumbly, crusty.        

216
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:50,349
         [music playing]        

217
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:54,353
 Moi Moi, one thing that really 
    says something is a pie,    

218
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:55,686
      you need a pie crust.     

219
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:59,090
     When you bust into this    
    and you let that soak up    

220
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:04,896
   all that filling, it takes   
  you right back to a log cabin 

221
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:06,298
    hanging out with grandma.   

222
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,234
 When you say that you're going 
   to put a pot pie on a menu,  

223
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,503
     better taste like that.    

224
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:12,437
           Definitely.          

225
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:13,772
    GUY FIERI: Deconstructed    
        chicken pot pie.        

226
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:16,307
   Of all that I've had, this   
  sits at the top of the menu.  

227
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:17,575
        MONICA KISSINGER:       
       Chicken pot pie up.      

228
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:20,244
          The gravy has         
     fantastic flavor to it.    

229
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,980
     SALTY'S CUSTOMER 6: The    
     crust, it's so crispy.     

230
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:22,781
     GUY FIERI: Just legit?     

231
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:23,782
          It's perfect.         

232
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:25,850
          We have your          
      loaded avocado toast.     

233
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,318
       SALTY'S CUSTOMER 7:      
       I am a Salty's fan.      

234
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:28,186
    It's like my second home.   

235
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,187
           [laughter]           

236
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,521
        It's like you and       
      Vanessa got together      

237
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:31,790
       and said let's make      
        the kind of food        

238
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:33,658
 we like for all of our friends.

239
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,060
 Let's have a really good time. 

240
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:36,260
       Proud of you guys.       
            - Thanks.           

241
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:37,728
    GUY FIERI: Everybody, by    
     the way, when you come,    

242

    it was going to be-- pork

  mustard caraway gravy sauce.

  That'll stick to your bones.  

324
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:02,974
  Then we go for the spaetzle.

      Regular flour, kosher     
        salt, whole eggs.       

326
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:09,447
    And you got to slap this    
      thing until the dough

       is just to die for.      

366
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,312
        It's a very warm        
       and comforting food      

367
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:15,647
 for the winter time especially.

368
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:17,581
         You're open all        
      year round unless it      

369
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:18,450
     gets what temperature?     

370
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:19,918
     15 below is my cutoff.     

371
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,852
          I shut down.          

372
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:21,786
          Stuff breaks.         

373
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:22,721
              Yeah.             

374
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:24,055
       KONRAD'S SON: Dad,       
        we got one brat.        

375
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:25,123
           OK, my son.          

376
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:26,124
         I get it going.        

377
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:27,058
  GUY FIERI: This guy's legit?  

378
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:27,993
            Oh, very.           

379
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,327
              Yeah.             

380
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,129
   GUY FIERI: I can't say the   
 trailer's anything to look at. 

381
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,930
      It's the quality that     
    comes out of the trailer.   

382
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,065
       Always really good.      

383
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,134
  Two salty pretzels going in.  

384
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,601
   Excellent German pretzels.   

385
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:40,538
    Salted, cheesy, whichever   
        way you like it.        

386
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:41,606
         GUY FIERI: What        
       are we making now?       

387
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:42,540
       The pretzel dough.       

388
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:43,541
  GUY FIERI: Let's get into it. 

389
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:44,742
       KONRAD BOLZ: Water,      
        and not too hot.        

390
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:45,943
         You don't want         
       to kill the yeast.       

391
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:46,878
           The sugar.           

392
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,946
        GUY FIERI: Yeast        
        loves the sugar.        

393
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:50,815
       KONRAD BOLZ: Salt.       
     Just a little bit mix.     

394
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:51,683
         Melted butter.         

395
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:52,483
            And now?            

396
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:53,617
     KONRAD BOLZ: The flour.    

397
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:54,685
     GUY FIERI: All-purpose?    
      KONRAD BOLZ: Caputo.      

398
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:55,886
  So a little more chew to it.  

399
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:56,821
  KONRAD BOLZ: A little bit in. 

400
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:57,622
      GUY FIERI: No recipe.     

401
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,023
    I do have a basic recipe.   

402
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:00,025
       - It's all up here.      
             - Yeah.            

403
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,958
             Right.             

404
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:01,892
           Crazy man.           

405
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:03,360
        KONRAD BOLZ: Add        
       step by step flour       

406
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:05,497
      until your dough has      
     the right consistency.     

407
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:08,233
      And then you have to      
    let it rise for 3 hours.    

408
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:09,434
       Make our portions.       

409
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:10,769
    GUY FIERI: I want to see    
    how he does the old spin.   

410
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:11,569
           [laughter]           

411
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:12,570
        This one, right?        

412
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:13,637
      GUY FIERI: Beautiful.     

413
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:14,773
        Once they proof,        
      they go to the water.     

414
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:15,840
   And anything in the water?   

415
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:16,774
    KONRAD BOLZ: Baking soda.   

416
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:17,776
         GUY FIERI: That        
       gives a little bit       

417
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,110
  of that sheen on the outside. 

418
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:20,645
 KONRAD BOLZ: It should come up.

419
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:22,246
     GUY FIERI: Some get an     
     egg wash and get salt--    

420
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:23,515
        KONRAD BOLZ: Yes.       

421
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:24,916
   GUY FIERI: --and then some   
  get the shave of the cheese.  

422
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:25,717
      KONRAD BOLZ: Correct.     

423
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:26,584
       Then into the oven.      

424
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,921
  12 to 14 minutes, 450 to 460. 

425
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:30,722
         GUY FIERI: Wow.        

426
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:31,523
            Gorgeous.           

427
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:34,392
         [music playing]        

428
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:36,194
        I love pretzels.        

429
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:38,796
               Oh!              

430
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,331
   Great pretzel salt on top.   

431
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:42,000
   Nice crust on the outside.   

432
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:43,802
  Great chew, light and tender. 

433
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:47,472
       Hand-made all day.       

434
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:50,008
    And the key is the cheese   
     nice and dry on there.     

435
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,078
       I could eat my body      
       weight in pretzels.      

436
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:55,079
 I don't want to hear any jokes.

437
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:56,280
           [laughter]           

438
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,082
    Two salty pretzels going.   

439
00:11:58,118 --> 00:11:59,818
    MEIN DINER CUSTOMER 5: I    
  really like the salt pretzel. 

440
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:01,219
There's like salt in every bite.

441
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,487
       MEIN DINER CUSTOMER      
      2: The cheesy pretzel     

442
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:03,688
   probably my favorite thing.  

443
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,490
     MEIN DINER CUSTOMER 1:     
     He adds a lot of cheese    

444
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:07,759
       on to those, which       
     makes them incredible.     

445
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:09,160
KONRAD BOLZ: Schnitzel sandwich.

446
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:11,028
   MEIN DINER CUSTOMER 6: I've  
 been to Germany numerous times,

447
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,563
    and this is like bringing   
       Germany to Alaska.       

448
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:14,499
 GUY FIERI: This is what "Triple
  D" is all about, my friend--  

449
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:15,834
     funky joints like this.    

450
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:18,102
        If it hadn't been       
    recommended, I would not    

451
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:19,838
     stop here in a million     
        years when I saw        

452
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:20,905
  the outside of this trailer.  

453
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:22,107
Half of the letters are missing.

454
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,842
        But what's inside       
         and what you do        

455
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:25,843
        and how you make        
     people feel, well done.    

456
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,044
        - Thank you, sir.       
          - All right.          

457
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,845
     Let's get these to go.     

458
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:28,913
      I'mma wrap these up.

           Coming up,           

464
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,119
 we're still eating up Alaska--

       GUY FIERI: This is       
    pushing it over the top.    

466
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,189
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
       --with a real cool

       one love, one Rico.

00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,061
     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):     
        --and the music--       

470
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:44,395
 GUY FIERI: As soon as I started
    talking to him about it,    

471
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,396
       he starts to dance.

     GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER):

476
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:54,238
     GUY FIERI: So I'm here     
      in Fairbanks, Alaska.     

477
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:56,374
     And folks, I have come     
    to expect the unexpected    

478
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:57,575
    when I come to this town.   

479
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:59,043
       You never know what      
      you're going to get.      

480
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:00,311
       You get folks from       
       all different walks      

481
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,847
  of life, which means you get  
 all different types of cuisine.

482
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,650
  So when I hear there's a jazz 
   joint that has a real deal   

483
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,586
 Cuban chef that's cooking in a 
 tiny little kitchen that looks 

484
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:09,988
         like you're in         
      somebody's apartment,     

485
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,656
         well, that says        
     "Triple D" all over it.    

486
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,858
   This is Jazz Bistro on 4th.  

487
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,659
           Here we go.

00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,796
     JAZZ BISTRO CUSTOMER 1:    
    It's really quite amazing   

491
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:22,199
 that you can come to Fairbanks 
 and find authentic Cuban food. 

492
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:23,401
     Pork sliders, order up.    

493
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,135
   JAZZ BISTRO CUSTOMER 2: We   
    love the atmosphere here.   

494
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:28,606
 Live music, it just transports 
      you to another place.     

495
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:30,875
  GUY FIERI (VOICEOVER): Thanks 
  to husband and wife team Rico 

496
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:34,679
  Zavaleta and Lenora Byam who  
 found each other through music 

497
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:36,747
    but stayed for the food.    

498
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:38,549
      From Cuba to Alaska.      

499
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:39,884
     RICO ZAVALETA: I know.     

500
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:42,020
  GUY FIERI: Was the intention  
  to serve food and play music  

501
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,955
      or have music and we      
   should probably have food?   

502
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,557
        RICO ZAVALETA: My       
     first passion is music.    

503
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:46,824
        GUY FIERI: You're       
       into music as well?      

504
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:47,959
             I sing.            

505
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:49,227
    RICO ZAVALETA: She wanted   
      to own a restaurant,      

506
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:51,161
 and I've been in the restaurant
      business all my life.     

507
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:52,363
        GUY FIERI: 'Cause       
       you're a musician.       

508
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,231
              Yeah.             

509
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:54,232
 GUY FIERI: Of course you have. 

510
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:55,900
        We had to put the       
       music in the food.       

511
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:57,836
 JAZZ BISTRO CUSTOMER 3: I love 
  everything on the menu here.  

512
00:13:57,971 --> 00:13:58,770
  RICO ZAVALETA: Lechon asado.  

513
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:00,104
            Vaminos!            

514
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,906
   JAZZ BISTRO CUSTOMER 3: My   
  favorite is the lechon asada. 

515
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,908
  JAZZ BISTRO CUSTOMER 4: It's  
  marinated pork, bell peppers, 

516
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,043
             onions.            

517
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,243
   JAZZ BISTRO CUSTOMER 5: The  
    sauce he put on the food    

518
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:07,711
           is awesome.          
   GUY FIERI: All right, chef.  

519
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:08,512
        What's up first?        

520
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:09,647
      Lechon pernil asado.      

521
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:10,848
       The lechon pernil.       

522
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,116
       And that comes with      
         rice and beans?        

523
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:13,051
           You got it.          

524
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,453
       I'm gonna start by       
       stabbing the pork.       

525
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:16,988
     GUY FIERI: Stud it with    
       some garlic cloves.      

526
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,656
    RICO ZAVALETA: I'm gonna    
       pour some olive oil      

527
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,392
 and set this bad boy in there. 

528
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:23,661
        Lemon-lime juice,       
        salt and pepper.        

529
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:26,331
     GUY FIERI: Achiote, so     
      the beautiful color.      

530
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,999
      RICO ZAVALETA: Cumin      
        and some oregano.       

531
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:30,468
    Let that sit for about an   
   hour and a half, two hours.  

532
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,469
      GUY FIERI: Next step?     

533
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:32,937
      RICO ZAVALETA: We're      
     gonna make some sazon.     

534
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:34,672
  Now people know sazon because 
  they see it in the container, 

535
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:35,673
        the dried sazon.        

536
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:36,807
    This is the legit sazon.    

537
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:37,942
     This is a legit sazon.     

538
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:39,477
       GUY FIERI: Spanish       
      olives with pimento.      

539
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,279
      RICO ZAVALETA: Basil.     
 GUY FIERI: California chilies? 

540
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:42,013
       RICO ZAVALETA: Yes.      

541
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:43,814
  So not spicy, but herbaceous. 

542
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,416
     RICO ZAVALETA: Onions,     
       sweet bell peppers.      

543
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:46,283
   GUY FIERI: The whole lemon.  

544
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:47,484
   RICO ZAVALETA: You got it.   

545
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,887
         Olive oil and a        
      little bit of water.      

546
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:50,955
           Bland this.          

547
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,156
      GUY FIERI: Pour this      
       over the top of it,      

548
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:54,025
   and then after that we can   
     start to cook the pork?    

549
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,225
           You got it.          

550
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:56,627
      Why-- why as soon as      
    I started talking to him    

551
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:57,895
  about it he starts to dance?  

552
00:14:57,931 --> 00:14:59,663
     Well, in the kitchen we    
  usually have music going on.  

553
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:00,831
            - Really?           
             - Yeah.            

554
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:01,899
     Well, you got it going     
   on in your head right now.   

555
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:02,900
     I know, I know, I know.    

556
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:04,168
    I'm going to make a mojo.   

557
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:08,106
  Garlic, orange slices, olive  
 oil, salt and pepper, oregano, 

558
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:11,108
       culantro, achiote,       
        lemon-lime juice,       

559
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:12,443
   hand-squeezed orange juice.  

560
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,846
 After all that's rested, we're 
  gonna put sazon that we made  

561
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:16,180
   and the mojo that we made--  

562
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:17,916
    GUY FIERI: Onto the pork    
     and then into the oven.    

563
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:21,118
RICO ZAVALETA: 350, and raise it
 to about 425 in the last hour. 

564
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:22,453
   Then we'll make the beans.   

565
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:23,855
   RICO ZAVALETA: We'll start   
 with some black beans, organic,

566
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:24,856
           and water.           

567
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:26,056
     GUY FIERI: So we're not    
      going to soak these.      

568
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,458
     We're just going to let    
    all those flavors build.    

569
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,061
     RICO ZAVALETA: Onions,     
   salt, and pepper, oregano,   

570
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:32,730
   cilantro, garlic, achiote.   

571
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:33,864
          Slow simmer?          

572
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,466
    RICO ZAVALETA: For about    
       2, 2 and 1/2 hours.      

573
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:36,801
        GUY FIERI: Right.       

574
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:37,401
    RICO ZAVALETA: Then we're   
  going to make a lechon asado. 

575
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,536
          Jump in that.         

576
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,806
       RICO ZAVALETA: Oil,      
   onions, garlic, red bells,   

577
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:42,940
         shredded pork.         

578
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:44,008
        I just don't see        
      any flavor in there.      

579
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:44,809
          Do you guys?          

580
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:46,010
          None at all.          

581
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,946
   RICO ZAVALETA: Then we got   
     some rice, black beans.    

582
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:48,946
    This is a normal portion?   

583
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,014
       RICO ZAVALETA: Yes.      

584
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,882
     Bring the whole family     
     down for this one, huh?    

585
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:53,150
       RICO ZAVALETA: The       
        slaw goes on top.       

586
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:54,819
    GUY FIERI: And what's the   
     slaw made out of, chef?    

587
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:57,421
     RICO ZAVALETA: Vinegar,    
   achiote, lemon-lime juice,   

588
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:58,756
      oregano with garlic.      

589
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,993
         [music playing]        

590
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:10,768
      If you don't stop me,     
    I'll eat the whole thing.   

591
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,904
    Amazing flavor from a lot   
     of citrus and cabbage,     

592
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:16,707
     very simple foods done     
     in the correct balance.    

593
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,242
    You're going to get your    
    crunch out of your slaw.    

594
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:20,511
      You're gonna get your     
      fat out of your pork.     

595
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,913
    You're gonna get the acid   
      coming from the mojo.     

596
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:24,915
  You're just going to get all  
 your little components that you

597
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,584
   want that fortify the dish.  

598
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,252
          Outstanding.          

599
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:29,586
  This is Cuban Alaska, buddy.  

600
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:30,454
           Delicious.           

601
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:31,722
          Lechon asado.         

602
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,524
  JAZZ BISTRO CUSTOMER 6: It's  
    rich and full of flavor.    

603
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:34,992
      JAZZ BISTRO CUSTOMER      
     2: Very tender, juicy.     

604
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,794
   JAZZ BISTRO CUSTOMER 7: The  
  beans are absolutely amazing. 

605
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:37,996
         I do everything        
       but lick the bowl.       

606
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:39,397
       Have you ever been       
       here for the music?      

607
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,398
     JAZZ BISTRO CUSTOMER 6:    
  That's really what hooked us. 

608
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:42,199
      Everybody had gotten      
         their food, and        

609
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:45,736
  so Lenora and Rico were just  
 like oh, let's play some music.

610
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:46,938
        As soon as you're       
       done, why don't we       

611
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:48,406
    just have a jam session?    
  JAZZ BISTRO CUSTOMER 6: Yeah. 

612
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:49,940
     JAZZ BISTRO CUSTOMER 7:    
      The music is amazing,     

613
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,809
  and the food is just so good. 

614
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:53,210
   You can't get enough of it.

         [music playing]        

616
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,679
      GUY FIERI: I'm going      
         to finish this.        

617
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:57,748
 You go play some music, because
  I know it's driving you nuts. 

618
00:16:57,784 --> 00:17:00,018
     When we come back, more    
      Cuban fantastic-ness.     

619
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:01,285
    RICO ZAVALETA: Churrasco!   

620
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:02,286
      JAZZ BISTRO CUSTOMER      
          8: The steak          

621
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:03,754
  dish is one of my favorites.  

622
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,356
     JAZZ BISTRO CUSTOMER 9:    
   It's definitely different,   

623
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:06,424
         in a good way.         

624
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,624
       GUY FIERI: Jazz on       
     4th, Fairbanks, Alaska.    

625
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,692
        See you in a bit.       

626
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:09,827
       Can I get a little       
      bit more of the slaw?     

627
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,496
         [music playing]        

628
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:13,798
       Gosh, I can't-- I'm      
     watching them eat this,    

629
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:14,932
 and my mouth is still watering.

630
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,534
      The food is so good.      

631
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:17,601
    I could take that plate.    

632
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,070
      JAZZ BISTRO CUSTOMER      
     10: If you want a bite,    

633
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:20,071
      you can grab a fork.      

634
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:20,872
        It looks so good.       

635
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:21,672
             [beep]             

636
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:22,807
         [music playing]        

637
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:23,941
          Welcome back.         

638
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:25,943
     "Triple D" hanging out     
      in Fairbanks, Alaska      

639
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:27,811
 for exactly what you'd expect--

640
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:28,679
           Cuban food.          

641
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:29,880
          That's right.         

642
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:33,418
    At Jazz Bistro on Fourth,   
    a small little restaurant   

643
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,887
      serving a lot of big      
   flavor with awesome music.   

644
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,222
          The pork was          
      lights-out delicious.     

645
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:39,557
      What are you going to     
      follow that up with?      

646
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,425
     What's the encore song?    

647
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:42,493
      Churrasco, order up.      

648
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:43,961
     JAZZ BISTRO CUSTOMER 9:    
     The churrasco actually     

649
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:46,831
    reminds me a lot of carne   
  asada, with the lemon juice,  

650
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,299
     parsley, and tomatoes.     

651
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:50,568
  JAZZ BISTRO CUSTOMER 1: It's  
  a really rich and yummy dish. 

652
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,702
         We're chanting.        

653
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:52,970
  We're standing in the lounge. 

654
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,772
  We're going to do a sofrito.  

655
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,643
   We start with cilantro and   
 parsley, fresh tomato, salt and

656
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:00,845
 pepper, fresh oregano, paprika.

657
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:01,912
 GUY FIERI: Mixed peppers again.

658
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:02,713
            Yes sir.            

659
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:04,982
    Onions, cumin, jalapenos.   

660
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:06,183
        This-- I don't--        

661
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,586
    I've never seen that many   
   jalapenos in a Cuban dish.   

662
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:09,920
        RICO ZAVALETA: We       
     won't put them all in.     

663
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:13,657
      Bell peppers, water,      
        red wine vinegar.       

664
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:14,592
     Heat it up in the pan.     

665
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:15,593
       GUY FIERI: Next up?      

666
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:17,194
       We're going to make      
       a Rico Song sauce.       

667
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,729
    GUY FIERI: You named the    
      sauce after yourself?     

668
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:20,531
       And actually that's      
    the name of my band too.    

669
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:21,999
   "Song" means music, mambo.   

670
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:25,136
        Why every time he       
     talks he makes it cool?    

671
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:27,004
       (CUBAN ACCENT) Your      
      car has a flat tire.      

672
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:28,272
    Your toilet is backed up.   

673
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:30,942
           [laughter]           

674
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:32,810
     RICO ZAVALETA: We start    
   with the peppers, carrots--  

675
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,614
 GUY FIERI: Yellow bell peppers,
    onions, red bell peppers,   

676
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:38,349
    and again the jalapenos.    

677
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:41,152
    Rico Song is going loco.    

678
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:43,020
      RICO ZAVALETA: We got     
     some lemon-lime juice,     

679
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:46,156
     tomato juice, salt and     
    pepper, and some oregano.   

680
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:47,291
         Cilantro again.        

681
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,492
RICO ZAVALETA: Water, olive oil.

682
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:49,560
 Rico Song pushing the blender. 

683
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:50,427
              Yeah.             

684
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,496
  [laughs] Rico Song pushing--  

685
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,297
  Rico Song pushes the blender. 

686
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:54,465
           [laughter]           

687
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:56,134
             Ha ha!             

688
00:18:57,837 --> 00:18:58,769
         What do we got?        
          - [inaudible]         

689
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,170
         GUY FIERI: OK.         

690
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:01,639
   RICO ZAVALETA: I'm going to  
 slice up about a quarter inch. 

691
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:02,839
       Add some olive oil.      

692
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:05,510
       Get that really hot      
    before we put the steak.    

693
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,679
         [music playing]        

694
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:12,083
  Green olives, onions, garlic. 

695
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:15,853
        We add the meat.        

696
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:17,120
        GUY FIERI: That's       
      how I always put out      

697
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:19,257
  my pan fires Rico Song style. 

698
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:21,259
   Rico Song salsa, vinegar--   

699
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:23,127
     RICO ZAVALETA: Sofrito     
      that we made earlier.     

700
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,863
   While that's cooking, we're  
  going to make a chimichurri.  

701
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:28,532
        Cilantro-parsley        
       mix, fresh onions,       

702
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:30,668
        salt and pepper,        
      paprika and achiote,      

703
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:33,204
  culantro, cilantro, tomato--  

704
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:35,272
     GUY FIERI: Little olive    
    oil and some lemon lime.    

705
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:37,074
        So we're going to       
      plate the churrasco.      

706
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:37,942
          Chimichurri--         

707
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:39,210
         Let me Rico it.        

708
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:40,344
   RICO ZAVALETA: Mambo, baby.  
             Mambo.             

709
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,145
             Mambo.             

710
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,548
           [laughter]           

711
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,549
    I want to just jump right   
    into the rice and beans,    

712
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:47,285
        'cause I know how       
       fantastic they are,      

713
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,153
      but I got to go right     
       over here to this.       

714
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:55,759
It's actually dangerous to think
 of you with a real big kitchen.

715
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:57,160
        Then I don't know       
       what would happen.       

716
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,764
      Because if this much      
      flavor is coming out      

717
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,566
     of this little kitchen,    
  you're like the culinary Tony 

718
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:03,634
    Montana right now, dude.    

719
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,703
        Well, one taste,        
       one love, one Rico.      

720
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:08,906
         [music playing]        

721
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:11,108
      Flavors are dynamite.     

722
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:12,777
       Energy is amazing.       

723
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:15,112
  This is push-it-over-the-top. 

724
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:16,313
       Churrasco for you.       

725
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:19,116
       The meat is just so      
  tender and so nicely cooked.  

726
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:20,851
   JAZZ BISTRO CUSTOMER 4: It   
    just melts in your mouth.   

727
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:22,119
      JAZZ BISTRO CUSTOMER      
          9: The salsa          

728
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:24,055
   put over it coincided with   
   the meat all work together.  

729
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,455
     RICO ZAVALETA: Put the     
      love in the cooking.      

730
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:26,991
      JAZZ BISTRO CUSTOMER      
     8: This place deserves     

731
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:28,326
   a billboard in the airport.  

732
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:29,060
           [laughter]           

733
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:31,595
 One taste, one love, one Rico. 

734
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:32,396
     Don't forget that man.     

735
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:33,196
           [inaudible]          

736
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:33,997
