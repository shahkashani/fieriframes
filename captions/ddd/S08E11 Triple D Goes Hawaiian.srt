        IT IS SO AMAZING.       

27
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,198
   (Guy)                        
   I'VE ROASTED SOME PIG        
   BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN IT       
   JUST DISINTEGRATE LIKE THAT. 

28
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,667
      LOOK AT THAT RIGHT THERE, 
      THAT'S GREAT.             

29
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:13,372
 THAT'S ALL RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW
 AS "TRIPLE D" GOES HAWAIIAN.

00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,620
THIS TIME ALL THE WAY TO HAWAII.

32
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:31,490
  NOW YOU KNOW I LOVE THE '67,  
  BUT IT WON'T FLOAT,           

33
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,226
  SO THIS TIME                  
  I'M CRUISIN' HAWAIIAN-STYLE.  

34
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:35,960
    CHECK OUT THE SURF WAGON.   

35
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:38,764
WE'RE STARTING OUT              
WITH OLD-SCHOOL HAWAIIAN COOKING

36
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:40,699
 AT A PLACE CALLED HIGHWAY INN. 

37
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:43,635
              WELCOME TO HAWAII 
               AND HIGHWAY INN. 
OH, THANK YOU.                  

38
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:45,771
        ONE BUTTERFISH...       

39
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:47,706
           MY FAVORITE          
           WITH THE STEW GRAVY. 

40
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:49,440
YOU DRIVE 30 MINUTES OUT HERE   
JUST TO HAVE THIS.              
                    I DRIVE 45. 

41
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,176
LOMI AHI.                       

42
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:52,978
     AHI FISH                   
     WITH GREEN ONIONS,         
     EXCELLENT, NICE AND FRESH. 

43
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,380
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF            
THE COCONUT CUSTARD?            
     THE BEST IN TOWN I'VE HAD. 

44
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,783
THIS IS TRADITIONAL,            
AUTHENTIC.                      

45
00:01:57,785 --> 00:02:01,452
   MY GRANDPARENTS STARTED IT   
   IN 1947, HAD SEVEN CHILDREN. 

46
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:03,855
      OUT OF THE SEVEN CHILDREN 
      SIX WORKED HERE.          

47
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:06,391
      (Guy)                     
      AND REGINA TOGUCHI'S      
      DAD BOBBY...              

48
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:08,526
DAD, I'M GONNA DO               
THE WET PIPIKAULA.              

49
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:10,595
     (Guy)                      
     IS STILL IN THE KITCHEN    

50
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,664
  DOING TRUE HAWAIIAN CLASSICS  
  THE WAY HIS DAD DID.          

51
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:16,534
        LAULAU IS THE TARO LEAF 
        WRAPPED AROUND A MEAT.  

52
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:19,338
     YOU CAN PUT BEEF, CHICKEN. 

53
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:20,939
      PORK LAULAU IS TRADITION. 

54
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:23,809
      AND A PIECE OF BUTTERFISH 
      TO ENHANCE THE FLAVOR,    
      IT'S DELICIOUS.           

55
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,744
SO LET'S GET INTO THIS.         

56
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,279
WE NEED TO SALT THE PORK FIRST, 
SEA SALT WE'RE USING.           

57
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:30,415
AND THIS IS PORK BELLY          
LIKE WE MAKE BACON OUT OF.      

58
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,016
          THIS IS A BUTTERFISH. 

59
00:02:32,086 --> 00:02:34,419
WHY DO THEY CALL IT BUTTERFISH? 
  IT'S VERY OILY, A LOT OF FAT. 

60
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,221
BUT IT DOES ALSO HAVE A HEAD?   
                         RIGHT. 

61
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,022
I WOULD BE VERY SCARED          
IF THAT'S HOW IT SWIMS AROUND.  

62
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:40,692
SO THIS GETS FILLETED           
AND SALTED.                     
           THIS WE NEED TO SALT 
               ABOUT TWO WEEKS. 

63
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:43,494
THEN WE CHOP IT UP?             
                 WE CHOP IT UP. 

64
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:45,564
           THEN THE LEAF        
           FROM THE TARO PLANT. 

65
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,699
OUT OF THIS?                    

66
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,301
THIS REALLY DOES LOOK           
LIKE YOU DROVE IT OVER          
IN YOUR BUICK.                  

67
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:51,769
         WE'LL TAKE TWO LEAVES. 

68
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:53,838
THE STEMS GO TOGETHER?          
                    EITHER WAY. 

69
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,108
SEE, YOU HAVE THEM TOGETHER,    
I HAVE MINE OVER HERE           
IN DING DONG LAND.              

70
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,711
                   THEN WE TAKE 
     ABOUT FOUR PIECES OF PORK. 
HE JUST JAMS IT IN THERE.       

71
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,713
                      ONE FISH. 
WOW, IT'S HARD.                 

72
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:03,515
IS THE BONE AND EVERYTHING      
STILL IN IT?                    
              YEAH, IT'LL MELT. 

73
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:05,317
THE BONE WILL MELT?             
                           YEAH.

74
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,586
ANOTHER LEAF.                   
                 JUST TO COVER, 
           MAKE IT INTO A BALL. 

75
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,654
             THEN JUST CONTINUE 
             TO BUILD THE BALL. 

76
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:11,656
HEY, HEY,                       
YOU'RE WRAPPING VERY QUICKLY.   

77
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:13,725
   THEN YOU TAKE THE TI LEAF... 

78
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:16,594
CAN YOU MAKE ACTUAL TEA         
WITH THIS?                      
                    OH, NO, NO. 

79
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:18,597
NO, IS THAT A TRANSLATION       
IN HAWAII FOR DUMMY?            

80
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,733
 THEN YOU TAKE THE SECOND LEAF. 
IT'S LIKE A TAMALE.             

81
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:24,469
      IT HAS BECOME A LOST ART, 
      HOW TO TIE THE LAULAU.    

82
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,871
THE LOST ART OF LAULAU.         
           OF TYING THE LAULAU. 

83
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:30,608
SO THE TYING PART               
IS USING THESE TWO FINGERS HERE 

84
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:33,945
  THROUGH THE HOLE, UNDERNEATH, 
  AND YOU'VE GOT IT TIED.       

85
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,948
WHAT DO YOU THINK,              
HOW DID I DO?                   
                 YOU LOOK NICE. 

86
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,418
NOW WE'VE GOT THEM MADE,        
NOW WHAT DO WE DO WITH THEM?    

87
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,886
WE NEED TO CUT THE STEMS        
AND THEN THEY HAVE TO STEAM.    

88
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,688
      BIG STEAMER, DID YOU HAVE 
       THIS MADE JUST FOR THIS? 
YES.                            

89
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:46,090
                  THEN WE START 
               TO LOAD THEM IN. 
WE'LL MAKE A CIRCLE.            

90
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,426
         I CAN'T BELIEVE        
         THEY'RE ALL GONNA FIT. 

91
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:50,562
                  THAT'S A LOT. 

92
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,497
             AND HOW LONG IS IT 
       GONNA GO IN THE STEAMER? 
TWO HOURS.                      

93
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,566
     TWO HOURS, SO ARE WE DONE? 
SO WE NEED TO OPEN THIS.        

94
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,567
THIS THING'S GONNA BE HOT.      

95
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:57,636
IT SMELLS LIKE LEAVES,          
WOW, IT'S GONNA BE NUTS.        

96
00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:59,971
I WILL UNWRAP IT FOR YOU.       
                           OKAY.

97
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:02,574
     (Guy)                      
     IS IT GONNA TASTE BETTER   
     THAN IT LOOKS, YOU TELL ME.

98
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:04,610
         IT TASTES MUCH,        
         MUCH BETTER.           

99
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,045
MMM, THAT'S GOOD,               
THE FAT REALLY MELLOWS IT OUT   

100
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:09,781
AND YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF  
AMOUNT OF SALT IN THERE,        
I LOVE IT.                      

101
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,917
A LITTLE BIT OF                 
A SPINACH TEXTURE TO IT.        

102
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,584
THIS IS MORE GREENS             
THAN I'VE HAD THIS MONTH.       

103
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,587
I'M DOWN WITH THE WHOLE THING.  

104
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:17,789
NOW WHAT'S THIS STUFF HERE,     
POI SERVED COLD?                
                           YEAH.

105
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,458
IT LOOKS LIKE PUDDING.          
     IT'S THE ROOT OF THE TARO. 

106
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,861
        TRY IT, YOU'LL LIKE IT. 
HERE WE GO.                     

107
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,729
THAT'S FUNKY,                   
IT TASTES LIKE YOGURT.          

108
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,998
IT'S BETWEEN LIKE A GREEK YOGURT
AND A REGULAR YOGURT.           

109
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,800
IT'S GOT A LITTLE BIT OF        
SOURNESS TO IT,                 

110
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:31,002
BUT WHEN YOU ADD                
THE SALTINESS OF THE PORK       

111
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,537
AND THE HERBACEOUSNESS OF       
THE TARO,                       

112
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,072
THAT COMBO RIGHT THERE,         
REALLY GOOD.                    

113
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:37,608
          LAULAU POI.           
 VERY MOIST, STILL IN THE LEAF, 
                  IT'S PERFECT. 

114
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,011
 POI WAS REALLY THE STAPLE FOOD 
 OF THE NATIVE HAWAIIAN PEOPLE. 

115
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,281
THEY STAY TRUE                  
TO THE ISLAND STYLE             
OF MAKING THINGS.               

116
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,684
       THE FOOD HASN'T CHANGED, 
       IT'S STILL THE SAME      
       HOMEMADE STUFF.          

117
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:47,686
LOMI AHI.                       
                     FRESH AHI. 

118
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,821
         WHY THE ICE CUBE,      
         KEEP IT NICE AND COOL? 

119
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:52,023
         THIS IS AS TRADITIONAL 
                   AS IT COMES? 
YES.                            

120
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,826
             (Guy)              
     FROM A TRIPE STEW...       
REGINA'S GOT ME HOOKED ON THIS. 

121
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:57,362
             (Guy)              
       TO SQUID LUAU...         
        MIXED WITH COCONUT MILK 
                AND TARO PLANT. 

122
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:58,897
  IT'S THE MOST DELICIOUS THING.

123
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:02,433
             (Guy)              
    AND THE NUMBER ONE ITEM     
        ON THE MENU...          
DOUBLE PIPIKAULA, HALF THAT.    

124
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:04,770
IT'S A SMOKED TYPE OF MEAT,     
IT'S DELICIOUS.                 

125
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:07,639
PIPIKAULA,                      
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?            
                    DRIED BEEF. 

126
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:08,907
       AND I JUST THOUGHT       
       IT WAS CALLED BEEF JERKY.

127
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,510
  SO WE'VE GOT A BIG CHUCK ROLL,
  SLICE IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH. 

128
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:13,845
           CAN I SEE THAT THING,
           THAT'S A KNIFE.      

129
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:16,114
         YOU MARINATE IT,       
         SPRINKLE IN SOME SALT. 

130
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,650
AND WHAT ARE WE PUTTING IN HERE,
IS THIS SOY?                    
                         SHOYU. 

131
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,585
JAPANESE WORD FOR IT.           

132
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,654
SHOYU, SOY SAUCE,               
EITHER WAY IT'S THE SAME THING. 
                             NO.

133
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,923
SO LAYER AFTER LAYER.           
        THEN WE HANG IT TO DRY. 

134
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,525
DO WE HAVE A SMOKER             
OR WHERE ARE WE GONNA HANG IT?  
              ABOVE OUR STOVES. 

135
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:28,593
IS THAT WHAT THE WIRE'S FOR?    
                            YES.

136
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,128
  YOU CAN'T SAY                 
  YOU GET TO DO THAT EVERY DAY. 

137
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,864
                           (Guy)
                     HOW LONG'S 
         THIS GONNA BE UP HERE? 
FOUR HOURS OR SO.               

138
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,666
          THIS RIGHT HERE,      
          LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, 
          THIS IS HISTORY.      

139
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,802
       NOW IT'S STARTING        
       TO RELEASE ITS MOISTURE. 

140
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:38,670
      MEAT RAIN IN FLAVOR TOWN. 

141
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:40,738
      I CAN'T WAIT TO TRY THIS. 

142
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,808
(Guy)                           
NOW WHAT HAPPENS                
AFTER IT HANGS?                 

143
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,210
         I FRY IT LIKE A STEAK, 
         PUT SOME OIL ON IT.    

144
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:47,345
AND NOW WE'RE GONNA HIT IT      
ON THE FLAT TOP AND             
CHOP IT UP.                     

145
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,214
EVERYDAY YOU SEE THIS.          

146
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:51,349
HANGING IT OVER THE GRILL,      
CUTTING IT ON THE FLAT TOP.     

147
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,952
NONE OF THIS IS MAKING SENSE.   

148
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,155
                      MMM, WOW. 

149
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,890
IT KIND OF REMINDS ME OF        
DRY-AGED BEEF, A LITTLE SALTIER.

150
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,626
IT KIND OF GIVES ME A FEELING OF
LIKE, WET BEEF JERKY,           

151
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:03,762
            THE RICHNESS OF IT, 
            ITS DEEP FLAVOR.    

152
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:06,698
               HOW IS IT AGAIN? 
PIPIKAULA.                      

153
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,633
SOMETHING I'VE NEVER HAD BEFORE.

154
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:10,635
JUST HANGING IT                 
OVER THE STOVE THING, FUNKY.    

155
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,637
CAPITAL "F" FUNKY.              

156
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,639
THE MOST FLAVORFUL PIPIKAULA    
I'VE EVER HAD.                  

157
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,641
I LIKE IT CRISPY,               
I LIKE THE FAT.                 

158
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:18,844
IT IS VERY SOFT,                
BUT IT ALSO HAS                 
A SMOKED FLAVOR.                

159
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:22,380
EVERYBODY CAN NOW TASTE         
A LITTLE BIT OF HAWAII.         

160
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:24,583
       TWO LAULAUS PLEASE.      

161
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:26,451
IT'S 52 YEARS OF                
A FAMILY TRADITION              

162
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,787
THAT WE'VE TRIED TO KEEP ALIVE. 

163
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,856
     THE HAWAIIAN FOOD HERE     
     IS UNBEATABLE.             

164
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:32,924
    AND THE PEOPLE              
    MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE OHANA.   

165
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,859
      IN HAWAIIAN WE SAY OHANA, 
      FAMILY IS IMPORTANT.      

166
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:37,462
  WELL I FEEL LIKE I'M PART OF  
  THE FAMILY NOW.               

167
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:39,130
            (Guy)               
            UP NEXT,            

168
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,267
    WE'RE HEADED TO THE WATER   
    FOR SOME OF THE FRESHEST    
    OF WHAT HAWAII DOES BEST.   

169
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,669
 LOOK AT THAT,                  
 YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. 

170
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:48,407
IT'S THE BEST FISH              
YOU WANT TO EAT ON THE ISLAND.  
             WHEN WE COME BACK. 

171
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:54,178
            SO HERE I AM        
            ON HONOLULU HARBOR. 

172
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:55,913
 NOW THIS IS WHERE              
 ALL THE FISHING BOATS COME IN, 

173
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:58,716
        DROP OFF THEIR CATCH,   
        AND THEN GO TO AUCTION. 

174
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:02,187
  NOW RESTAURANTS               
  IN INDUSTRIAL AREAS LIKE THIS 
  ARE USUALLY A HIT OR A MISS.  

175
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,390
BUT FROM WHAT I HEAR            
NICO'S AT PIER 38 IS A HOME RUN.

176
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:08,193
THE BEST FISH YOU WANT TO EAT   
ON THE ISLAND.                  

177
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:10,395
            THIS FISH IS FRESH. 

178
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:12,530
   YOU'RE TALKING A FRENCH CHEF 
   WHO KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING.   

179
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,732
THREE MEDIUM-WELL.              

180
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,668
 (Guy)                          
 THAT WOULD BE FRENCH-BORN OWNER
 NICO CHAIZE,                   

181
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:19,538
WHO'S SERIOUS ABOUT ONLY SERVING
THE FRESHEST SEAFOOD.           

182
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,673
       THIS GUY'S BUYING        
       FRESH FISH RIGHT HERE... 

183
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:25,277
    (Guy)                       
    AT 5:30 IN THE MORNING      
    AT THE AUCTION HOUSE        
    RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET.    

184
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,479
OH NICE.                        

185
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:30,549
     (Nico)                     
     THIS IS WHERE ALL THE FISH 
     CAUGHT IN HAWAIIAN WATERS  
     GET UNLOADED               

186
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:32,350
         AND SOLD THE SAME DAY. 

187
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,885
IS THIS AWESOME, OR WHAT?       

188
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:36,621
"DINERS, DRIVE-INS, AND DIVES"  
AND FISH MARKET.                

189
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,290
THIS IS CRAZY.                  
                           YEAH.

190
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:40,558
WHAT IS THIS?                   
          THAT IS A BIG MARLIN, 
        THAT'S A BIG MAHI-MAHI. 

191
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,427
WHAT IS THAT ONE?               
 THIS ONE IS OPAH, OR MOONFISH. 

192
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:45,630
 LOOK AT THE SIZE OF IT.        

193
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:48,433
    IT CAN GO UP TO 150 POUNDS. 

194
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:50,368
NOW WILL THEY BREAK IT DOWN     
FOR YOU?                        

195
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:51,570
  YES, THEY'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. 

196
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,638
            THAT IS GOING TO BE 
            OUR SPECIAL TODAY.  

197
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,774
LOOK AT THAT,                   
YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.  

198
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:57,776
      THAT IS THE LOIN OF OPAH, 
      THAT IS THE BASE PART.    

199
00:07:57,778 --> 00:08:00,178
BACK TO THE RESTAURANT?         
  YEAH, BACK TO THE RESTAURANT. 

200
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,315
   (Guy)                        
   WHERE NICO'S                 
   PUTTING HIS OWN TWIST

00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,385
     (Guy)                      
     AND SCRATCH-MADE           
     WATERCRESS CREAM SAUCE.    

203
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,321
FANTASTIC.                      

204
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:11,523
          SO WE'VE GOT          
          THE OPAH READY TO GO. 

205
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:12,657
         I'LL TAKE THE SKIN OFF 

206
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,792
        AND FROM THERE I'LL CUT 
        A SEVEN-OUNCE PORTION.  

207
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:17,262
IT'S A PRETTY FIRM FISH.        
                  PRETTY MOIST, 
             OPAH'S REALLY WET. 

208
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,796
OKAY, SO NOW WHAT HAPPENS?      

209
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,732
  SO NOW WE'RE GONNA FILL IT UP 
  WITH OUR CRAB STUFFING.       

210
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,001
I'VE GOT ONION, CELERY, GARLIC, 
SAUTE IN OLIVE OIL.             

211
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:26,671
 WE DEGLAZE IT IN A WHITE WINE  
 AND FRESH THYME WILL BE ADDED. 

212
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,807
SMASH IT UP, DIJON MUSTARD,     
CAYENNE PEPPER, AND HEAVY CREAM.

213
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:32,544
          SOME PANKO AT THE END 
          TO THICKEN IT UP.     

214
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:34,679
    SO 15 MINUTES IN THE FRIDGE 
    AND WE'RE READY TO GO.      

215
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:36,814
THE FILET'S SO THIN,            
HOW ARE YOU GONNA STUFF IT?     

216
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,750
   I'M GONNA GO ON THE TOP      
   AND CUT IT ALL THE WAY DOWN. 

217
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:40,818
            THEN STUFF IT       
            WITH OUR CRAB MEAT. 

218
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:43,688
SO YOU'RE DOING AN OPEN FACE?   
            AN OPEN FACE, YEAH. 

219
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:46,557
    NICE SEASONING              
    WITH WHITE PEPPER AND SALT. 

220
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,760
(Nico)                          
OLIVE OIL, WE ADD THE FISH,     
CRAB-SIDE DOWN FIRST.           

221
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:50,828
         QUICK BOTH SIDES,      
         FINISH IT IN THE OVEN? 

222
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,098
IN TEN MINUTES                  
IT WILL BE READY.               

223
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,633
              NOW WHAT HAPPENS? 
WE'RE GONNA MAKE                
A WATERCRESS CREAM SAUCE.       

224
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,503
SOME OLIVE OIL, ONIONS,         
GARLIC, DRIED THYME,            
WHOLE LEMON, PEELED.            

225
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:00,905
WHITE WINE.                     

226
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,308
          YOU HAVE THE TV HAND, 
          THE POUR.             

227
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,176
I ADD IN CHICKEN STOCK.         

228
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,445
          THAT'S REDUCED DOWN,  
          NOW WE ADD THE CREAM? 

229
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:09,447
             (Nico)             
             IT'S DONE,         
             NOW TO THICKEN IT. 

230
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,917
        STRAIN IT,              
        INTO THE BLENDER.       

231
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:15,453
                ARE YOU STRONG? 
OH YEAH.                        

232
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,589
NICE FRESH WATERCRESS.          

233
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:19,524
PUT THE WHOLE THING DOWN.       

234
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:21,726
                     JALAPENOS. 
JALAPENO.                       

235
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:24,529
                    JALA-PEENO. 
JALAPENO, IT'S PAIN-O.          

236
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,032
A BIG GREEN THING.              

237
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:29,668
PUT THE LID ON IT.              

238
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,669
YOU'RE GONNA BLEND IT           
AND THAT'S IT.                  

239
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,671
THAT LOOKS GREAT.               

240
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,006
             LET'S GET THE OPAH 
             OUT OF THE OVEN.   

241
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,809
IT JUST DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT      
PUTTING IT INTO                 
A TO-GO CONTAINER.              

242
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,045
           THE WATERCRESS SAUCE 
           RIGHT OVER THE FISH. 

243
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,947
MMM, CRAZY GOOD.                

244
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:46,618
THAT BITE RIGHT THERE,          
THAT'S A MILLION DOLLAR         
MONEY BITE.                     

245
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,689
THE WATERCRESS                  
WITH THE JALAPENOS IN IT        
IS OUT OF BOUNDS.               

246
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:53,625
I THINK                         
I COULD TAKE SOME OF THIS,      

247
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:55,559
SMEAR IT ON THAT LID,           
AND THEN EAT LID.               

248
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:57,629
THE STUFFING IS DYNAMITE TOO,   
DUDE, I MEAN IT'S...            

249
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,564
             IT'S ALL HOMEMADE. 

250
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:02,167
    (lightening and thunder)    

251
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:04,402
YOU HEAR THAT,                  
THUNDER FROM THE HEAVENS.       

252
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,705
WHAT?                           

253
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,641
GRILLED OPAH                    
WITH WATERCRESS CREAM SAUCE.    

254
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:11,710
IT'S FRESH AND IT'S LIGHT.      

255
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,378
    IT HAS THE PERFECT TEXTURE, 
    THE PERFECT TASTE.          

256
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,448
             THE FOOD IS GREAT. 

257
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,916
   (Guy)                        
   AND THE WORD'S GETTING OUT.  

258
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,917
       YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU GOTTA 
       GET HERE BEFORE LUNCH    
       OR COME IN AFTER.        

259
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,987
   (Guy)                        
   'CAUSE NICO'S CRANKING OUT   
   500 ORDERS A DAY.            

260
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:24,923
YOU GET FIVE-STAR QUALITY       
FOR ROCK-BOTTOM PRICES.         

261
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,925
IF YOU WENT TO A RESTAURANT     
IT WOULD COST LIKE, 30.         

262
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,729
         THAT DISH RIGHT THERE  
         WOULD BE $30, I AGREE. 

263
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:32,597
EVERYTHING IS $7.00?            

264
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,866
         YEAH, THE GOAL         
         IS TO BE UNDER $10.00. 

265
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,934
      I CAN GO TO A BURGER SHOP 
      AND END UP SPENDING MORE. 

266
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:39,804
      (Guy)                     
      AND STILL NOT END UP      
      WITH THE DOUBLE-PATTY     
      MARLIN BURGER.            

267
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:42,273
             HOW'S YOUR BURGER? 
        IT'S DELICIOUS.         

268
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,941
FRESH MARLIN BURGER, OKAY.      

269
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,811
 SO WE HAVE FRESH MARLIN CUBED, 
 THIS IS A STRIPED MARLIN.      

270
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,347
          PUT THE MARLIN        
          IN THE FOOD PROCESSOR 
          AND BLEND IT.         

271
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:52,617
OH, WE'RE REALLY                
BREAKING IT DOWN, HUH?          

272
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:54,752
        BREAKING IT DOWN,       
        THAT'S ABOUT IT.        

273
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:58,489
YOU AND THE FRENCH AND THE PATE.
        IT'S KIND OF LIKE THAT. 

274
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,892
SO WE'VE GOT THE GROUND-UP      
STRIPED MARLIN.

        DRIED DILL WEED.        

277
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:09,501
     THAT GIVES A LOT OF FLAVOR 
     AND FRESHNESS.             

278
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:12,637
DUDE, HOW MUCH                  
DID YOU JUST PUT IN THERE?      
                         A LOT. 

279
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,705
         SALT AND WHITE PEPPER. 

280
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:16,908
MARLIN AND DILL SANDWICH.

   THE JUICE OUT OF TWO LEMONS. 

283
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,448
         LIME ZEST, LIME JUICE. 

284
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:26,651
        NOW WE'RE GONNA MIX IT. 

285
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:28,653
SO NOW WHAT HAPPENS?            

286
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,588
PORTION IT ON COATED WAX PAPER. 

287
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:32,723
 THEN WE'RE GONNA SMASH IT DOWN 
 TO MAKE THE PATTIES.           

288
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:34,859
(Nico)                          
WE'RE GONNA DO                  
THE HAMBURGER BUNS.             

289
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:37,729
OIL FIRST, THEN WE'RE GONNA PUT 
THE MARLIN BURGER DOWN,         
TWO PATTIES.                    

290
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,331
   YOU GET A LOT OF CRISPINESS. 

291
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,866
BOTH SIDES, MEDIUM-RARE.        

292
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:45,269
   (Nico)                       
   SQUEEZE ON YOUR AIOLI FIRST, 

293
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:48,806
     BUTTER LETTUCE, RED ONION, 
     TOMATO AND TWO PATTIES     
     AND THAT'S IT.             

294
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,976
LOOK AT THAT,                   
NOW THAT'S A BIG BURGER.        

295
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:55,679
DUDE, THAT'S THE MOST TENDER    
SEAFOOD BURGER I'VE EVER HAD.   

296
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:57,749
LOOK AT ALL THE JUICE           
COMING OUT OF THAT.             

297
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:59,683
THAT SMOKES ANY FAST FOOD.      

298
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:02,220
I WOULD ORDER THAT AGAIN        
WITHOUT QUESTION.               

299
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,622
THE DOUBLE PATTY...             

300
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,691
THE GUY GETS IT.                

301
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:09,561
IT'S DEFINITELY HEARTY,         
YET LIGHT.                      
                     AND CHEAP. 

302
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,697
    YOU KNOW IT'S LOCAL,        
    YOU KNOW THE FISH IS FRESH. 

303
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:15,633
               NICO'S...        
               MMM, NUMBER ONE. 

304
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,835
    (Guy)                       
    YOU'RE A KNOCK-OUT CHEF,    
    THE FOOD TASTES OUTRAGEOUS, 

305
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:19,771

        COULDN'T BE ANY BETTER. 

306
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,440
 THIS WAS A REALLY GREAT VISIT. 

307
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:23,908

    'CAUSE WHEN HANK ADANIYA    
    MOVED TO PARADISE,          

321
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,947
   HE JUST HAD TO               
   START SERVING UP THE DOGS.   

322
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,683
HOT DOGS WERE IN MY BLOOD       
AND MY FAMILY WAS FROM HERE.    

323
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:08,419
 (Guy)                          
 HIS PARENTS RAN A HOTDOG JOINT 
 HERE IN THE '50s.              

324
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:11,022
    NOW IT'S HANK'S TURN        
    WITH A PLACE OF HIS OWN.

IS THE ONE HE BROUGHT           
FROM THE WINDY CITY.            

327

             WE SHIP THESE BUNS 
             IN FROM CHICAGO

I THINK HE'S DONE THAT BEFORE.  

334
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:34,379
                         ONION.

WE CALL THIS DRAGGING THE DOG   
THROUGH THE GARDEN.             
                    YOU GOT IT. 

339
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,589
        AND CELERY SALT, VOILA. 

340
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:46,991
THIS IS GOING TO BE HOT.        
     I THINK YOU CAN HANDLE IT. 

341
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,594
YOU KNOW WHAT WAS BEST ABOUT IT,
YOU COULD HEAR IT SNAP.         

342
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,396
LOOK AT ALL THE JUICE           
COMING OUT OF THAT.

NICE JOB.                       

344
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,334
       I'VE HAD THE CHICAGO DOG 
       AND THAT WAS GREAT.      

345
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:59,670
         YOU'VE DONE ABOUT FOUR 
   DIFFERENT TYPES OF HOT DOGS? 
WE DID.                         

346
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:01,672
I HAVE ENJOYED EVERY ONE,       
ALL OF THEM WERE DELICIOUS.     

347
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:04,075
THE ACCOUTERMENTS ON THEM       
ARE DIFFERENT.                  

348
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,344

       AND SCRATCH MADE.        
GARLIC AIOLI.                   

349
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,746
MANGO RELISH,                   
THAT'S REALLY AWESOME.          

350
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,616
      WASABI MAYONNAISE.        
                 CURRY KETCHUP, 
                  PRETTY TANGY. 

351
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,419
      (Guy)                     
      AND THIS ONE              
      MANGO MUSTARD             
      WITH AN ISLAND TWIST.     

352
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:16,888
IT GOES ON                      
OUR HAWAIIAN-STYLE HOTDOG.      

353
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:20,491
START WITH SOME BROWN MUSTARD   
AND THEN WE ADD SOME            
MANGO PUREE.                    

354
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,561
LIME JUICE HERE,                
SOME HONEY.                     

355
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:25,629
           HONEY, I LIKE        
           WHERE THIS IS GOING. 

356
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:27,832
AND THEN A LITTLE LIME ZEST.    

357
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:31,235
BLEND IT ALL TOGETHER           
AND HE'S GOING AT IT.           
                I GOTTA TRY IT. 

358
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:34,505
        OH, THAT'S NICE.        

359
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:37,375
          THAT'S REALLY ANOTHER 
          SPOON-NECESSARY NICE. 

360
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:39,510
                         MMM.   

361
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:41,579
   WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE SO FAR? 
I THINK THE HAWAIIAN.           

362
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:42,981
              THE HAWAIIAN DOG. 
     PICK UP THE HAWAIIAN.      

363
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:46,317
              IT'S REALLY GOOD, 
                    VERY TASTY. 
      THE CHICKEN HOTDOG        
        IS REALLY GOOD.         

364
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,386
        FAT BOY.                

365
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:50,455
     (Guy)                      
     A VERSION OF THE B.L.T.    

366
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:52,123
GREAT CRUNCH,                   
BACON ADDS IT.                  

367
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,659
YOU GOT THE PIG AND THE DOG     
RUNNING THROUGH THE GARDEN      
ON THAT ONE.                    

368
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,928
A LOT OF DIFFERENT VARIETY HERE.

369
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,796
        (Guy)                   
        AND THAT'S JUST         
        THE REGULAR MENU.       

370
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:00,865
EACH DAY OF THE WEEK            
WE DO A SPECIAL DOG.            

371
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:03,467
TUESDAYS WE HAVE ALLIGATOR,     
WEDNESDAYS IS RABBIT AND VEAL.  

372
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,870
WHAT WE DID WAS SAY,            

373
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:08,339
"LET'S TRY INTRODUCING SOME OF  
THESE REALLY GOURMET DOGS."     

374
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,474
FRIDAYS IS LOBSTER DOG.         

375
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:12,609
PROBABLY OUR                    
MOST POPULAR SPECIAL.           

376
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:15,212
YOU START                       
BY PUREEING THE SEAFOOD.        

377
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,948
BAY SCALLOPS.                   

378
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:20,818
YOU'VE GOT TUB-O-GROUND-OF-FISH.
YES, MMM-HMM.                   

379
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:23,755
TAKE THESE OUT                  
AND MOVE TO THE SHRIMP.         

380
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:26,357
         IT'S LIKE A DEVEIN     
         AND DE-SHELL 21 TO 25. 

381
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,625
MASH IT UP GOOD.                

382
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:30,695
LOBSTER TIME, I WANT THAT ONE   
FAIRLY ROUGH TO GIVE IT TEXTURE,

383
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:33,631
WE CAN FEEL THE LOBSTER         
IN THE SAUSAGE.                 

384
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,900
A LITTLE ONION THAT HAS BEEN    
SAUTED WITH GARLIC.             

385
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:39,703
CARROT, SHREDDED,               
A LITTLE GREEN ONION.           

386
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,373
NOW COMES THE SURIMI --         

387
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,575
A TUB OR TWO OF FISH PASTE.     

388
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,711
IT REALLY TIGHTENS IT UP.       

389
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:48,179
       GOT A LITTLE BIT OF NOSE 
       TO IT, DOESN'T IT?       

390
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:51,649
      IT'S KIND OF LIKE SOMEONE 
      DROVE THROUGH THE OCEAN   
      WITH A BIG OL' BLENDER.   

391
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:54,651
      (imitating blender noise) 

392
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:56,520
NOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE            
THE MAYONNAISE                  

393
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:58,056
THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEASON      
THE SAUSAGE WITH.               

394
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:00,391
      BECAUSE YOU'VE GOTTA HAVE 
             SOME FAT IN THERE. 
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.           

395
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,127
A LITTLE MAYONNAISE,            
HALF-AND-HALF.                  

396
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:04,996
LOBSTER BASE, NOT MUCH,         
IT REALLY IS PRETTY POWERFUL.   

397
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:08,399
A LITTLE CHILI POWDER, THYME,   
FINALLY SOME WHITE PEPPER.      

398
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,068
SO WE'VE GOT QUITE A MIX GOING. 
                   YEAH, WE DO. 

399
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:14,338
        NEXT IS A LITTLE BIT OF 
        PORK CASING.            

400
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,873
                THREAD THIS ON. 

401
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,476
     FOLKS, IF LOOK AT HIS FORM 
     THAT HE'S PRESENTING HERE, 

402
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,877
    THE THUMB                   
    AND WITH THE HAND CRANKING. 

403
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:23,280
     HE'S ALSO VERY GOOD        
     AT RUBBING THE TUMMY       
     AND PATTING THE HEAD NEXT. 

404
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,416
THAT LOOKS ABOUT RIGHT.         

405
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,952
NOW WE'LL JUST                  
TWIST THESE LINKS OFF.          

406
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:30,687
I'M GLAD YOU PUT THE FAT IN IT, 
THAT'LL MAKE IT NICE AND CREAMY.

407
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,624
 WHEN WE'RE ALL SAID AND DONE   
 WE GO INTO SOME BOILING WATER. 

408
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:35,960
   THAT WILL KIND OF POACH 'EM. 

409
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,761
   HIT 'EM INTO AN ICE BATH     
   TO STOP THE COOKING PROCESS. 

410
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,364
CHILL 'EM DOWN, YES,            
AND WE'LL HOLD 'EM.             

411
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:41,899
THEN WHEN WE'RE READY           
WE'LL GO AHEAD AND SEAR 'EM OFF 
INTO SOME BUTTER.               

412
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:45,503
WE FOUND THAT BY SEARING IT     
YOU CAN GET THAT CRUNCH AGAIN   
OFF OF THAT CASING.             

413
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:49,374
I THINK WE'VE GOT THIS ONE      
SAUTED UP.                      

414
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:52,243
WE JUST LET IT SIT              
IN CLARIFIED BUTTER.            

415
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:54,312
                 LET'S MAKE IT. 

416
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,847
        PRISTINE BUN,           
        LOTS OF SAUSAGE,        

417
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,684
         A LITTLE GARLIC AIOLI, 
         VERY GREEN RELISH.     

418
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,719
THE NEON.                       

419
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:05,456
       FOR A LITTLE ASIAN FLARE 
       WE HAVE SOME PICKLED     
       DAIKON RELISH.           

420
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,259
MMM, GOOD LOBSTER.              

421
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:09,861
THERE'S GOOD TEXTURE TO IT,     

422
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:12,329
THE RELISH AND THE DAIKON       
PLAY IN FOR A LITTLE CRUNCH.    

423
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:14,599
BUT I WILL TELL YOU,            

424
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,667
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE             
A UNIQUE DOG EXPERIENCE         
THAT'S THE DOG YOU WANT.        

425
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,137
NICE JOB, MAN.                  
                     BEAUTIFUL. 

426
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,805
        IT'S TO DIE FOR.        

427
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,673
     JUST THE MOST TASTY HOTDOG 
     I'VE EVER HAD.             

428
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:25,276
ANDOUILLE DOGS.                 
  I WANT TO TRY ALL OF THEM.    

429
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,412
  SO 60 SECONDS ON THE POLISH.  

430
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,546
    THIS IS MY NUMBER ONE SPOT. 

431
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,549
    WATCH OUT,                  
    THE HOTDOG KING RIGHT HERE. 

432
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,684
  THE CAPTAIN OF ENCASED MEATS. 

433
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:37,221
 NEXT UP WE'RE GOING TO A PARTY 
 WHERE THEY'RE ROASTING A PIG   
 IN THE GROUND.                 

434
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,690
 LOOK AT THAT RIGHT THERE, MMM. 
    THIS IS THE REAL STUFF.     

435
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,027
    IT'S LUAU TIME              
    WHEN WE GET BACK.           

436
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,534
 SO WHEN WE DECIDED             
 TO VISIT HAWAII ON             
 "DINERS, DRIVE-INS, AND DIVES" 

437
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:51,936
  ONE THING WE HAD TO CHECK OUT 
  WAS A LUAU.                   

438
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,605
 SO I GUESS NOW YOU CAN CALL IT 
 "TRIPLE D AND L."              

439
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:57,408
    SO HERE WE ARE,             
    TIME TO HIT THE BEACH       
    AT GERMAINE'S LUAU.         

440
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,677
    IT'S ALL ABOUT THE PARTY,   
    WHICH IS A TON OF FUN.      

441
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:03,481
(Guy)                           
EVEN WHEN YOU LIVE ON THE ISLAND
YOU STILL COME TO A LUAU?       

442
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:05,749
        I STILL COME TO A LUAU. 

443
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:09,487
             (Guy)              
 AND THIS ONE'S THE REAL DEAL.  
              IT IS SO AMAZING. 

444
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:10,688
      (Guy)                     
      WHERE THE LOCALS GO.      

445
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:13,024
        I AM FROM HAWAII,       
        THIS IS THE REAL STUFF. 

446
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,626
     (Guy)                      
     AND THE CENTERPIECE OF     
     ANY GOOD LUAU...           

447
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:17,562
          JUST PORK.            
                     KALUA PIG. 

448
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,763
         THEY COOK IT IN AN IMU 
         WHICH IS UNDERGROUND.  

449
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,866
PLACE THE PIG INTO THE IMU      
FOR ABOUT EIGHT HOURS.          

450
00:18:21,868 --> 00:18:24,635
      THE PIT'S CALLED THE IMU. 
THE PIT IS CALLED THE IMU.      

451
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:26,504
    (Guy)                       
    SCOTT HARADA SHOULD KNOW.   

452
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,906
      HIS FAMILY'S BUSINESS     
      MARIAN'S CATERING         

453
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:30,841
       HAS BEEN DOING           
       LUAUS AT GERMAINE'S      
       FOR OVER 30 YEARS.       

454
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,444
    THIS IS A GOOD-LOOKING HOG. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.            

455
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:35,046
  YOU SPLIT IT DOWN THE CENTER, 

456
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,782
   OPEN IT UP SO YOU CAN GET    
   ALL THE SMOKE INTO HERE      
   AND THE TEMPERATURE IN HERE. 

457
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,983
                      WHAT TIME 
        DID YOU START THE FIRE? 
COUPLE OF HOURS AGO.            

458
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:42,053
IT TAKES ABOUT TWO HOURS        
FOR THE ROCKS TO COME UP        
TO TEMPERATURE.                 

459
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:44,655
     SO THE CHARCOAL GOES AWAY, 
     THE ROCKS STAY SUPER HOT.  

460
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,724
                  I DIG IT,     
                  LET'S SEE IT. 

461
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,926
    (Scott)                     
    SO WE'VE GOT MIKE COMING IN 
    WITH HAWAIIAN SEA SALT,     

462
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:51,728
SALT THAT'S DRIED OUT           
FROM THE OCEAN WATER OVER HERE. 

463
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,464
SO THEY'RE GENEROUS WITH IT.    
                 VERY GENEROUS. 

464
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:54,999
        NOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?

465
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,067
        SOME OF THESE HOT ROCKS 
        ARE GONNA BE PLACED IN  
        THE CAVITY OF THE PIG.  

466
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,604
WE CAN COOK IT                  
FROM THE OUTSIDE IN             
AS WELL AS FROM THE INSIDE OUT. 

467
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:02,139
OH, YOU CAN HEAR                
THE FAT SNAPPING AND POPPING.   

468
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,742
       IT SMELLS GOOD, HUH GUY? 
IT SMELLS FANTASTIC.            

469
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:06,744
SO HE'S GETTING                 
A NEW PIECE OF CHICKEN WIRE.    

470
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,879
  NOW WE'RE GONNA BRING IN      
  THE STALK OF THE BANANA TREE. 

471
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,881
             IT HOLDS A LOT OF  
             HIGH-WATER CONTENT 

472
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,950
       SO THAT'S WHAT WE USE    
       TO IMPART FLAVOR AS WELL 
       AS THE MOISTURE.         

473
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:15,553
                           (Guy)
          NOW THE CHICKEN WIRE. 
WE'LL PLACE THE PIG ON TOP.     

474
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,289
WHOA, THAT ALMOST DIDN'T FIT.   

475
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:21,692
NOW WE'RE GONNA PUT THE LARGER  
PIECES OF BANANA STUMP OVER IT  
TO SEAL IT UP FROM THE TOP.     

476
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:24,561
HE'S GONNA BUILD A LITTLE HOUSE.
RIGHT.                          

477
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:26,630
     NOW WE GO WITH THE LEAVES, 
     A WET BURLAP SACK.         

478
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,632
THIS IS                         
A MODERN DAY IMPLEMENTATION.    

479
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,768
IT SEALS MUCH BETTER.           

480
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,770
TRADITIONALLY IT WAS            
ALL BANANA LEAVES ON TOP.       

481
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,972
WE WILL ALSO LAY                
OUR FINAL TARP OVER IT.         

482
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,774
 WOW, A LOT OF WORK,            
 ANYTHING GO UP ON TOP OF THIS? 

483
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:38,776
IT WILL BE COMPLETELY COVERED   
WITH SAND.                      

484
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,579
                   EIGHT HOURS. 
EIGHT HOURS OF LOVE.            

485
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:43,581
                   EIGHT HOURS, 
       BETTER BE SOME GOOD PIG. 
YES.                            

486
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:46,217
            IS THERE A CEREMONY 
           WHEN THIS COMES OUT? 
YES.                            

487
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,454

491
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,929
         I'VE ROASTED SOME PIG, 

492
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,731
   BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN IT       
   JUST DISINTEGRATE LIKE THAT. 

493
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:03,267
PUT SOME MORE SALT ON IT.       
         I LIKE HOW YOU SHOW UP

         SEEING PEOPLE OUT HERE 
         ENJOYING THEMSELVES.   

504

IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER.      
          IT'S HOME.
