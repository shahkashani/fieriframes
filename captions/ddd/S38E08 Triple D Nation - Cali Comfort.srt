 How expensive is the menu now?

 It is at least twice as large.

       It tastes amazing.       

357
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,368
          It feels like         
       a home cooked meal.      

358
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,770
       Dude, you're making      

359
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,439
          scratch made          
      legit food like this      

360
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:50,441
       from a little kiosk      
          in a market.          

361
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,576
        It's very hidden.       

362
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,912
   It's such a little secret.   

363
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,314
      [Guy]<i> But coming up,</i>      
      <i> the secret is out.</i>       

364
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,982
       It got much busier.      

365
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,518
        People are coming       
    from all over the place.    

366
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,987
       We'll be right back      
           after this.          

367

     [upbeat music playing]     

368
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,623
        [Guy] All right.        
         So, we're back         

369
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:08,359
         in Chichen Itza        
      here in Los Angeles.      

370
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:09,760
       <i> And back in 2015,</i>       

371

     <i> it was still a secret</i>     
      <i> in the neighborhood.</i>     

372
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:13,832
  It's one of those hidden gems 

373
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,700
       <i> that really needed</i>      
       <i> to be discovered.</i>       

374

   <i> +You don't wanna miss it.</i>   

375
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:20,572
      After Triple-D aired,     
  we had a lot of new exposure, 

376
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,240
       a lot of new people      
         heard about us         

377
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,508
     and started coming in.     

378
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,643
    [man] It got much busier.   

379
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:28,846
      <i> It's full of people</i>      
         <i> and I believe</i>

    from all over the place.    

381
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,649
    [Gabriel] And after that,   
           I opened up          

382
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,651
       a second restaurant      
        in the same space       

383
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,788
         <i> called Holbox.</i>        
   <i> It's a seafood restaurant.</i>

   <i> I love being in the space.</i>  

385
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:40,458
           I get to...          
   For one location take care   

386
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:41,526
      of both of my babies.     

387
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,527
        The whole market        
    just increased its volume   

388
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,529
  by about a thousand percent.  

389
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,332
    I'm really happy for them   
        that more people        

390
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:49,467
  get to experience their food. 

391
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,668
        [Guy] All right.        
    So what's the next dish?    

392
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:52,537
      -Panucho. All right.      
            -Panucho.           

393
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,405
     So, first, we're gonna     
     break down the turkey.     

394
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:55,606
    We're gonna boil the legs   

395
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:56,741
    and we're gonna sous vide   
           the breast.          

396
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,476
    [Guy] Because that's what   
        you see every day       

397
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:00,411
        in a little kiosk       
         Yucatan joint.         

398
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,413
     [Gabriel] Kosher salt,     

399
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,415
      take a sous vide bag,     

400
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:05,816
          a little bit          
      of cilantro in there.     

401
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:07,284
   -Are we gonna vacuum this?   
       -[Gabriel] We are.       

402
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:08,419
           [Guy] Okay,          

403
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,487
   hundred and fifty degrees?   

404
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:11,555
        -[Gabriel] Yeah.        
        -[Guy] How long?        

405
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:12,824
 -[Gabriel] Two and half hours. 
       -This is simmering       

406
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,559
     to where it's so tender    
    that when you open it out   

407
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,826
    in the bag, it will just    
        fall apart. Okay.       

408
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:18,362
 [Gabriel] So, we're gonna make 
          the tortillas         

409
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:19,564
     -now for the Panuchos.     
           -Tortillas.          

410
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,633
    [Gabriel] So, we're gonna   
   make little balls of masa.   

411
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,234
           In it goes.          

412
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,239
   [Guy] So why is this going   
         to pop up open?        

413
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,974
    Mine don't often pop up.    

414
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:32,443
   [Gabriel] Ones both layers   
       are cooked evenly,       

415
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:34,379
        you pressed down        
        on the tortilla,        

416
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:36,513
   that creates better contact  

417
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,049
 on the surface of the plancha, 

418
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:41,452
     it generates more heat     
 and more heat generates steam, 

419
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:44,322
      and the steam is what     
    balloons the tortilla up.   

420
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,457
       Learn something new      
        every day, baby.        

421
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:47,525
             -Okay.             
     -[Gabriel] Open it up.     

422
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:48,526
     Some black bean puree.     

423
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:50,662
           [Guy] Okay.          

424
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,597
         Cover the hole         
     and you spread it out.     

425
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:53,864
         -[Guy] Love it.        
   -Now we're gonna fry them.   

426
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:56,467
        -[Guy] All right.       
     -Little bit of lettuce,    

427
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,336
    some of the shredded leg    
    and the sous vide breast,   

428
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:01,338
    some pickled red onions,    

429
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:03,208
             tomato,            

430
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:04,342
     and a slice of avocado.    

431
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,410
      [Guy] And that's all      
           she wrote.           

432
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:07,145
      That is the Panucho.      

433
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:12,550
      Man, it's so tender,      

434
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:16,621
           delicious.           

435
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:19,357
  It's subtle, it's authentic.  

436
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,226
    That's a nostalgic dish.    

437
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:24,561
          Oh, my gosh.          

438
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:26,898
  Order of peking chick for 23. 

439
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,500
         [woman] Coming         
  from Mexico and coming back,  

440
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,836
     it was like I was back     
        in Mexico again.        

441
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:33,838
       [Gabriel] This dish      
   is called cochinita pibil.   

442
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:37,308
     It's probably the most     
       representative dish      

443
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,910
       of Yucatan cuisine.      

444
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:41,713
   Here we have a 70-pound pig  
    that's been cut in half.    

445
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:44,449
   We're gonna separate head,   
         shoulder, loin,        

446
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:46,384
          and the ham.          

447
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:48,585
      And then we're going      
          to inject it.         

448
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:51,422
        So, this marinade       
      is made with achiote,     

449
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,591
   lime juice, fresh squeezed   
          orange juice,         

450
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:57,528
         garlic cloves,         
        and kosher salt.        

451
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:58,729
   Now, we're just gonna pour   

452
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:01,466
 the rest of the marinade over, 

453
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:03,401
    and, uh, we're gonna add    
            two heads           

454
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:04,868
       of roasted garlic.       

455
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:07,405
       And then, uh, part       
 of the pibil cooking technique 

456
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,807
         is wrapping it         
  completely in banana leaves.  

457
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:12,810
     We cook it in the oven     
 but we don't turn the oven on. 

458
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:14,479
 We just put the hot embers in. 

459
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:15,679
      After about 12 hours,     

460
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,414
  the cochinita is fully cooked 

461
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:18,616
     and it's falling apart.    

462
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:19,884
   We have a good mixture here  

463
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:22,619
      of all the different      
        parts of the pig.       

464
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:25,156
       We're gonna garnish      
  this with pickled red onions  

465
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:27,158
    and one habanero pepper.    

466
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:29,493
    Cochinita for table two.    

467
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:30,561
   [man]<i> It's got sour orange,</i>  

468
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:31,629
    <i> it's cooked in bananas,</i>    

469
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,364
     <i> slow roasted braised,</i>     

470
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:34,432
        <i> so it's tender.</i>        

471
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,300
     It's a little bit sour     
       but full of flavor,      

472
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:37,635
        meaty, delicious.       

473
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,771
      [woman]<i> There's zest,</i>     
      <i> there's like vinegar</i>     

474
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,573
       that helped amplify      
         the sauciness,         

475
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,508
         the pork itself

     anything with chicken,     

580
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,522
         The Cluckster.         

581
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,458
      The name kind of goes     
        with the Oinkster       

582
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,593
    but, uh, chicken version.   

583
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:26,330

   with our all-purpose flour,  

584
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:28,332
       cumin, garlic salt,      

585
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:30,534
   celery salt, white pepper,   

586
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:34,338
      basil, regular salt,      
      ginger, dry mustard,      

587
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:37,275
   paprika, and black pepper.   

588
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,945
     We have this pre-brined    
        chicken breasts.        

589
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:44,482
    Dip it in the buttermilk,   
      put it in our dredge.     

590
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,485
  We fry this for five minutes. 

591
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:49,620
     Now, we have our ranch     
       dressing on there,       

592
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:52,690
        shredded lettuce,       
       some Dill pickles,       

593
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,825
       the chicken breast,      

594
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:57,628
        and a little bit        
      of our buffalo sauce,     

595

  [woman] We got the Cluckster.

  [woman] The chicken is juicy, 

599
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:06,671
   breading is not too heavy.   

600
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:07,838
        <i> It's just crispy</i>

          it's perfect.         

603
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,578
          [indistinct]

     [upbeat music playing]     

608
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,453
   I was just kind of low-key   

609
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:25,389
    <i> but we had a lot of fun.</i>

      just the jazz hands.      

612
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,230
            [laughs]            

613
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,133
    How long on that chicken?

619
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,418
  Would you like a bigger wisk?
