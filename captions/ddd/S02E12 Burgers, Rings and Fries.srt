   "WELCOME TO LITTLE VEGAS."   

200
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:28,907
              WHAT IS THE THEME?
JUST MAKE IT CHEERFUL.          

201
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:31,842
             OH, IT IS CHEERFUL.
CHEERS ME UP                    
 EVERY DAY.                     

202
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,711
              HOLY NEON-O-RAMA. 

203
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:36,248
             "WELCOME TO JOE'S."
"WELCOME TO JOE'S               
ADDICTIVE BURGERS."             

204
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:38,250
       NOW ARE YOU ALWAYS       
 IN THE DINING ROOM DOING THIS--

205
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:40,252
        WALKING AROUND,         
       TALKING TO PEOPLE?       
SIX DAYS A WEEK.                

206
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:42,120
        SIX DAYS A WEEK?        
SIX, SEVEN DAYS, YEAH.          

207
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,522
        THE CALIFORNIA. AND HOW 
       WOULD YOU LIKE IT COOKED?

208
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:47,792
    TODAY I HAD                 
THE TERIYAKI BURGER.            
         I GOT THE PIZZA BURGER.

209
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,261
             I GOT A PATTY MELT.
               THEY'RE AMAZING. 
  I DO NOT                      
ADD ANYTHING.                   

210
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:52,864
I TAKE IT THE WAY               
 JOE SERVES IT.                 
       CHEDDAR,                 
   CHEDDAR, CHEDDAR.            

211
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:55,133
       IT'S JUST A REALLY       
       DELICIOUS BURGER.        
          (bell dings)          

212
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:58,203
        EVERYBODY HAPPY?        
  THE MEAT                      
IS THE STAR.                    

213
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,005
     <i> AND TO MAKE IT RIGHT,</i>     
           <i> HE INSISTS</i>          

214
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,208
   <i> IT'S ALL ABOUT CUTTING IT</i>   
 <i> FRESH--TOP-GRADE CHOICE BEEF.</i> 

215
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:06,210
             I DON'T LIKE TO USE
             THE WORD "BURGER," 

216
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,080
         BECAUSE THEN IT MESSES 
           EVERYBODY'S BRAIN.   

217
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:11,416
                     IT'S JUICY.
       REAL GROUND BEEF.        

218
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:14,152
        <i> AND IT'S TRIMMED</i>       
  <i> AND GROUND FRESH EVERY DAY,</i>  

219
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,487
   <i> RIGHT IN THE RESTAURANT.</i>    
    (man) SEEING                
THAT GUY OVER THERE             

220
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,623
WITH THAT LITTLE HOOK           
   AND THAT KNIFE,              

221
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,425
JUST CARVING,                   

222
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,961
   AND THEN IT GOES             
RIGHT INTO THAT GRINDER         

223
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:25,229
AND PLOPS RIGHT                 
ONTO THAT GRILL.                

224
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:26,898
        THEY'RE ALL CHUCK ROLLS.
THEY'RE ALL CHUCK ROLLS.        

225
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,633
                          READY?
GO.                             

226
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:31,902
   WHAT FAT RATIO ARE WE        
TRYING TO GET--FAT TO MEAT?     

227
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:35,039
      BY THE TIME WE COOK IT,   
   YOU END UP WITH 6% TO 8% FAT.

228
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,841
SO YOU'RE GETTING--             

229
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,910
CONTRARY TO THE BELIEF          
      THAT 80-20                

230
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,980
IS THE PREMIUM GRIND            
   FOR A BURGER--               

231
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,781
BUT IF YOU'RE USING             
  THE BEST MEAT,                

232
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,850
  THEN YOU DON'T HAVE           
TO WORRY ABOUT THAT FAT.        
                             NO.

233
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:47,318
OKAY, WELL,                     
LET'S GRIND.                    

234
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:50,522
WHEN WE LOOK INSIDE THIS,       
   WE REALLY GET MEAT.          

235
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:52,524
      WE GET ACTUAL             
CHEWABLE PIECES OF MEAT,        

236
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:57,729
NOT MASHED AND PROCESSED.       
 I MEAN, YOU ACTUALLY--         

237
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,731
              AND THAT'S WHY    
           IT'S A STEAK BURGER, 

238
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:02,400
      BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY GOT 
    TEXTURE--MEAT TEXTURE TO IT.

239
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:05,403
AND WHEN YOU BITE INTO IT,      
   YOU HAVE MORE FLAVOR,        

240
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,538
MORE JUICE.                     
      THE MEAT HAD FLAVOR.      

241
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,140
        IT WAS SO FRESH.        

242
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:12,544
IT DOESN'T TASTE LIKE YOU WONDER
       WHAT ELSE IS IN IT.      

243
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:15,012
                  SO WHERE'S    
              THE PATTY MACHINE?
THAT'S THE PATTY MACHINE.       

244
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:17,482
       YOU'RE THE PATTY MACHINE.
         LET ME SEE THAT THING. 
YEAH, OH.                       

245
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:18,950
                            WOW.
NOW THE MAGIC STARTS.           

246
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:22,554
                 THIS IS WHEN   
              THE MAGIC HAPPENS?
YEAH.                           

247
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:24,755
     SO THAT'S HOW IT GETS MADE.
     WOW, THAT'S A LOT OF MEAT. 

248
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,424
          WE GOTTA FLATTEN THIS,
                  RIGHT?        
YEAH.                           

249
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:28,026
                 PRESS IT DOWN? 

250
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:31,096
SHAPE IT UP.                    
            THAT'S IT--JUST GIVE
              IT A LITTLE LOVE? 

251
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:33,098
YEAH, AND THEN--                
                WANT ME TO PRESS
                    IT AGAIN?   

252
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,299
WHEN YOU GO LIKE THAT,          
        THEN...                 

253
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,101
 SO IT GETS IT                  
TIGHT TOGETHER.                 
                    AND NOW     
                JUST PICK IT UP?

254
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,370
   THE WAX PAPER'S NOT EVEN BIG 
           ENOUGH, JOE.         

255
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:42,106
   SECOND TIME IS WHEN I GIVE IT
        THE BIG SMACKDOWN.      

256
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,142
YEAH, YOU PUT IT DOWN,          
        AND...                  

257
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:49,046
DID YOU DO THIS GAME?           

258
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:51,716
ALL WE DO IS SALT...            

259
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,785
        WHAT DO WE DO NOW, SING?
  YOU SING,                     
YOU BLESS IT.                   

260
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,988
                   YOU BLESS IT?
YEAH!                           

261
00:10:57,057 --> 00:11:00,058
MOST PEOPLE GO LIKE THIS--      
        OH, BLESS.              

262
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,128
I THINK THAT'S JUST WHEN THEY'RE
TRYING TO KEEP THEIR HANDS WARM.

263
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,131
               JOE, I'M READY   
           TO FLIP WHEN YOU ARE.
YEAH, OKAY.                     

264
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:10,201
           WATCH THIS.          

265
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,271
                  DON'T TRY THIS
                     AT HOME.   
(Joe) DON'T TRY IT.             

266
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:18,943
                         OH.    

267
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:22,547

               BANANAS IS GOOD. 

268
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,615
         LOOK AT ALL THE JUICE. 

269
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:26,617
                  CRISPY BACON. 

270
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,886
            LITTLE BIT OF THAT  
           BITE FROM THAT ONION.

271
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:31,823
         I LIKE THE TERIYAKI.   
       THAT'S A LOT OF AVOCADO. 

272
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:33,825
                ANYTHING I'D DO 
               WITH PIZZA SAUCE.

273

   YEAH, THESE ARE MY TOP THREE.
