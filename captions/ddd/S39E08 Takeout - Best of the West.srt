1
00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:02,201
   So when I come off the road  
      from doing<i> Triple D,</i>      

2
00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:04,670
   the first thing I wanna do   
    is get home to my kitchen   

3
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,404
        and cook my food        
         for my family.         

4
00:00:06,474 --> 00:00:07,672
     And after a few weeks,     
          I gotta be--          

5
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:11,677
    Dad, can we just, please,   
       go to a restaurant       
       at least one time?       

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,278
      They start to revolt.     

7
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,080
   So I came up with the idea,  
     how about we reach out     

8
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:19,284
  to some of our favorite chefs 
          and have them         
      send us dinner, huh?      

9
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:20,085
        I like that idea.

 <i> we're always jonesing for...</i>

     -The famous Carne Asada

         -Yes, that one.

00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,679
       Finally, I give you      
           the recipe.          

55
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:28,880
              Shh.              

56
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:30,815
   Alma, give me the rundown.   
       What are we making?      

57
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:33,485
  [Alma]<i> Camarones a la Diabla.</i> 
         <i> Spicy shrimp.</i>         

58
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:34,619
   How do we wanna start this?  

59
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:37,556
     First, we're gonna make    
  the salsa a la Diabla sauce.  

60
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,490
  [Guy] So the roasted tomatoes 
             go in.             

61
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,893
      A little bit of salt      
         and chipotles.         

62
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:44,630
      -Chipotles in adobo.      
    -Use like three or four.    

63
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:46,564
       When I go hang out       
        with Sister Alma,       

64
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:49,167
     it's not three or four,    
     it's three or fourteen.    

65
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,368
           [chuckles]           

66
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:51,637
         -[Alma] Onions.        
     -[Guy] And the garlic?     

67
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:53,639
 Only two pieces of the garlic. 

68
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:56,842
  Now there is a orange juice.  
            Shake it.           

69
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,910
            -Me or...           
    -Yeah, you have to shake    
           your booty.          

70
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:01,580
      When you're chopping,     
  you have to shake your booty. 

71
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,982
   -That's part of cooking it?  
             -Yeah.             

72
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:06,851
           [Alma] Add           
      the Mexican chilies.      

73
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,721
  -Chili de arbol. All of them? 
           -Only six.           

74
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,590
             Hunter,            
    get some tortillas going.   

75
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:14,326
         I'll take this         
     and go to the blender.     
      Ryder, get over here.     

76
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:18,329
        Alma, do you want       
      any texture to this?      

77
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:20,232
     -Make it into a puree.     
            -Got it.            

78
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:22,867
    Talk amongst yourselves.    
       I'll be right back.      

79
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,103
      I wanna try this dish     
      they're making, Alma.     

80
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,006
      Oh, this looks good.      

81
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:29,807
   Ooh, that's got some heat.   

82
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,610
   Now what are these shrimps   
       been marinated in?       

83
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,613
      Chopped garlic, oil,      
        the sauce, the...       

84
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,748
  It is hard to me for say it.  

85
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:38,617
     -Worcestershire sauce.     
           -That one.           

86
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:41,753
  -The old washer-sister sauce. 
         -There you go.         

87
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:44,556
   We're gonna put on the pan   
           the butter.          

88
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:45,958
            How long            
     do these marinate for?     

89
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:47,559
       We did it yesterday      
         for you today.         

90
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:49,561
       I've got the shrimp      
       working in the pan.      

91
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,430
      They're just turning      
          translucent.          

92
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:53,965
      [Alma] The next step      
  is gonna be only the onions.  

93
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:55,100
      Now the bell peppers.     

94
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,436
         I see a package        
        of ketchup here.        
     What's that all about?     

95
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,438
         You have to add        
        the ketchup too.        

96
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:00,572
            -Ketchup?           
            -Really?            

97
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,906
         -Ketchup. Yeah.        
              -Wow.             

98
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:04,776
    That will make the sauce    
       a little bit sweet.      

99
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:07,713
      -What am I into now?      
         -We have to add        
     the salsa a la Diabla.     

100
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:10,382
        -[Guy] How much?        
    -[Alma] Just half of it.    

101
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,651
      -I think you got it.      
              -No.              

102
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,919
       -Smells fantastic.       
            -It does.           

103
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,454
       I think it's coming      
      right through the TV.     

104
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:18,023
         And we're ready        
      to put this together.     

105
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,859
      -[Alma] Side of rice.     
    -Avocado on the lettuce?    

106
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,396
     -Tomatoes on the side.     
     -[Guy] Couple of limes.    

107
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:25,797
         Hunter, did you        
      make yourself a bite?     

108
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,666
         -No, I thought         
        we were sharing.        
   -No, no, we're not sharing.  

109
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,201
           -This is--           
           -I thought           
      it's father and son.      

110
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,235
    No, this is dad's plate.    

111
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,540
   [Hunter] If you had told me  
        there was ketchup       
        in Mexican food,        

112
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:36,475
 I would not have believed you. 

113
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:37,609
       That is delicious.       

114
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,477
     -[Guy] You don't taste     
       the ketchup at all.      
        -[Hunter] Mm-mm.        

115
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:42,414
          Those veggies         
       are still so crisp.      

116
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:43,815
           That shrimp          
      is so tender though.      

117
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:48,620
      -The sauce is a combo     
       of sweet and heat.       
            -Mm-hmm.            

118
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,688
    Having this little salad    
           on the side          

119
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:52,690
        where you're able       
      to cool yourself down     

120
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,559
  because there is a little bit 
  of heat on the back of that.  

121
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,495
     -It's fantastic, chef.     
           Thank you.           
             -Nice.             

122
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:57,429
     -Thank you. Thank you.     
           -Well done.          

123
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:58,297
            Nice job.           

124
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,565
              Ooh.              

125
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:04,169
       So it's really hard      
       to follow somebody       
   that's a 2009<i> Triple D</i> OG.   

126
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:09,374
          That's unless         
          you're a 2007         
     <i> Triple D</i> original OG.     

127
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:10,575
    <i> This is Baby Blues BBQ.</i>    

128
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:14,846
      This is kind of like      
        pulled pork meets       
       au jus French dip.       

129
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:17,515
         -That's right.         
  -Just keep working. I'll eat. 

130
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:18,650
    Whoa, you sent us a lot.    

131
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:21,119
       Made in... [laughs]      
         No, you didn't.        

132
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:24,456
     When I first met Rick,     
      and back then, he had     
     a partner named Danny,     

133
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:25,724
      <i> and they're mixing</i>       
     <i> their barbecue sauce.</i>     

134
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:29,194
        And here they are       
       with their magical       
         bucket system.         

135
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,397
        And... [humming]        

136
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,398
         [all laughing]         

137
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:34,666
         And I called it        
      the dueling buckets,      

138
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:38,670
     and it says right here,    
 "Made in the dueling buckets." 

139
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:39,805
        -That's awesome.        
           -Well done.          

140
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:41,540
        All right, buddy.       
      Walk me through this.     

141
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:43,675
      [Rick] We're gonna do     
   a couple of our appetizers.  

142
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:46,678
 <i> The Suicide King with tri-tip</i> 
       <i> and hush puppies.</i>       

143
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,947
      -How are we doing it?     
 -There's some cornbread there. 

144
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:50,148
  -That needs to be warmed up.  
            -Got it.            

145
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,418
      And then you're gonna     
       make coleslaw too.       
          You got mayo.         

146
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:55,487
          -Brown sugar.         
     -[Rick] Dijon mustard.     

147
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,688
      -[Hunter] Buttermilk?     
   -Yep. Apple cider vinegar.   

148
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:00,492
        -I don't see ACV.       
      -It's like a liquid.      

149
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,826
           -Oh, is it?          
              -Oh!              

150
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,963
             -Yeah.             
   -I was looking for a block   
     of apple cider vinegar.    

151
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,164
 I'm like, "Where did that go?" 

152
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:09,367
  You mean the thing that says  
 "One of two for the coleslaw." 

153
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:10,702
              -Yes.             
              -Oh.              

154
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,437
       -[Guy] Horseradish.      
      -[Rick] Celery seed.      

155
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,439
     -All of it? [whistles]     
        -Yup. All of it.        

156
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:15,640
            -Cayenne.           
      -[Rick] Kosher salt.      

157
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,041
    Poppy seeds. Add pepper.    

158
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,578
         [Guy] So while         
       he's mixing that up      
      and adds in cabbage,      

159
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,179
   tell me about the tri-tip.   

160
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:26,618
     We marinate the tri-tip    
 with garlic, cilantro, tamari, 
      washer-sister sauce.      

161
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,254
       Oh, you could smell      
  the smoke on it right there.  

162
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:33,592
   -I smoked it for two hours.  
 -I thought you were putting... 

163
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,860
           -[laughing]          
        -He fell for it.        

164
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:38,597
       Tri-tip is on there      
       getting some color.      

165
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:40,732
     Let's make a remoulade.    
          It's gonna go         
      on top of everything.     

166
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,734
          -Lime juice.          
       -[Rick] Mayonnaise.      
   A little triple egg sauce.   

167
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:46,671
      -Yeah, that's scary.      
         -[high-pitched]        
   I think it's really smooth.  

168
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,806
        Little bit heat.        
       Some molasses too.       

169
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:50,675
     -Hunter, you wanna get     
    the hush puppies started?   
          -Yeah, yeah.          

170
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,912
           -Flour and           
    baking soda into a bowl?    
    -With the cornbread mix.    

171
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:57,081
    And there there should be   
    some cheddar jack blend.    

172
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:01,019
     -That's a lot of cheese    
        in there, buddy.        
      -Cheese adds flavor.      

173
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,954
            Profound.           

174
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,890
        -What temperature       
      you want that oil at?     
          -[Rick] 350.          

175
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,959
    [Rick] Those hush puppies   
      about three minutes,      

176
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:10,829
    and the outside will get    
    golden brown and crispy.    

177
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,764
     [Guy] Hunter's working     
        the hush puppies.       

178
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,233
      We've got the smoked      
       marinated tri-tip.       

179
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:17,102
      That's on the grill,      
        and the cornbread       
         is in the oven.        

180
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:21,439
       When we come back,       
  we're gonna put this together 
  and whoever knows what else.  

181
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,107
       <i> Triple D Takeout</i>        
     will see you in a bit.     

182
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:24,776
     -Which two do you want?    
           -Which two?          

183
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,446
     I made these actually.     
          They're mine.         

184
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:34,753
          Welcome back.         
       <i> Triple D Takeout.</i>       

185
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:37,622
  Hanging out in the backyard,  
        and Hunter and I,       

186
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:41,026
     well, we're cooking up     
         Baby Blues BBQ         
        in Venice Beach.        

187
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:45,363
       And our buddy Rick       
    has sent us an appetizer    
   he calls the Suicide King.   

188
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,832
         We got a smoked        
       marinated tri-tip,       

189
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:50,368
    and I assume you want it    
     on the bias like this?     

190
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:51,636
   -Oh, yeah, that's perfect.   
         -Hey, hey, hey.        

191
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,839
        -What? I'm just--       
         -I didn't say.         
      I'm the one slicing.      

192
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:56,841
  [Guy] Look at that beautiful  
       smoke ring on that.      

193
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,644
    That cornbread's a bomb.    
     What do you smoke with?    

194
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,581
         [Rick] Hickory,        
        white oak, apple.       

195
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,583
         Wow. Delicious.        

196
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:05,984
   [Guy] Little barbecue sauce  
            on this.            

197
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:08,386
      North Carolina style.     
    Little bit of remoulade.    

198
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:09,787
       [Guy] A little bit       
         of the cotija.         

199
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,256
      [Rick] A little slaw      
          on the side.          

200
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,059
     Couple of hush puppies.    
     What goes on with this     
    honey butter you sent me?   

201
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:17,395
   [Rick] It's honey in butter  
     with a little cinnamon     
          and vanilla.          

202
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,231
       [Hunter] Oh, yeah.       

203
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:25,736
     [Guy] Tri-tip, I think,    
  is one of the greatest cuts.  

204
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:29,340
        And in this dish        
       in particular, mmm,      
    we're talking lights out.   

205
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:30,675
    Takes smoke really well.    

206
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:32,610
        -Nice and tender.       
           -Oh, yeah.           

207
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,146
       The barbecue sauce       
      and the remoulade...      

208
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:37,549
          go perfectly.         

209
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:38,816
            You know,           
     you get the creaminess,    
       you get the acidity      

210
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,685
    coming through from that    
    Carolina barbecue sauce.    

211
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:43,288
   [Hunter] And the sweetness   
       from the cornbread       
          mixing it in.         

212
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:50,695
      And the hush puppies,     
    the cheese to flour ratio   
           was crazy.           

213
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:51,829
  Kind of gooey in the middle.  

214
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,899
    I eat much more of this,    
  I'll be gooey in the middle.  

215
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:57,269
   Whoo! And that honey butter  
         to top it off,         
   that's a treat right there.  

216
00:08:58,505 --> 00:08:59,837
          -Outstanding.         
           -Seriously.          

217
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:03,708
        All right, folks.       
   If you like burgers, I got   
    a crazy buddy named Bret.   

218
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,043
      He's down in Arizona.     

219
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,713
            And this,           
      ladies and gentlemen,     
   is Paradise Valley Burger.   

220
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:13,451
           Your burger          
       interpretive dance,      
    what would it look like?    

221
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,720
    Start with the nose plug,   
       work its way down.       

222
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,655
     -That's where it's at.     
         -Slowly switch.        

223
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,523
   -And some ice. There we go.  
          -Line dance.          

224
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:21,059
      Country Fried Burger.     

225
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:27,032
      It takes the regular      
         everyday burger        
        to another level.       

226
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:29,601
     Well, I gotta tell you,    
             Bret...            

227
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,103
 -I'm sorry. Who's in the back? 
              -Who?             

228
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:33,871
            [screams]           

229
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,875
        Oh, I'm so sorry.       
         I have no idea         
    how this man got in here.   

230
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:38,943
            [laughs]            

231
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:42,614
           Conquering           
      all hungry appetites,     
        it's Burger Man.        

232
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:44,616
         This is Brian.         
         He was actually        
   the first employee I hired   

233
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,351
     and he's still with me     
        ten years later.        

234
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,953
      Brian, how much money     
        do you owe Bret?        

235
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:52,557
     -I mean, what happened?    
     -If you're in trouble,     
          blink twice.          

236
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,492
           [laughing]           

237
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:55,927
      [Guy] How many boxes      
       did you send home?       

238
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,896
         Two large boxes        
     and like a medium box.     

239
00:09:57,898 --> 00:10:01,299
      -No, no, they're all      
        very large boxes.       
    -They're all large boxes.   

240
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:03,902
            [laughs]            

241
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,304
    -Does this say Doughitos?   
           -Doughitos.          

242
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:08,840
        -You make these?        
           -Yes, sir.           

243
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,641
        Our pizzas take,        
    like, 25 minutes to cook,   

244
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:11,643
          so I set them         
       in the dining room       

245
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,244
      so they could eat it      
   like bread while they're...  

246
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,914
      -Actually, those are      
     really good Doughitos.     
        -Thank you, sir.        

247
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:19,417
    Cheeseburger drink rafts.   
   Very nice. Then, fantastic.  

248
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,653
  -Not only did you send me...  
        -It's duct-taped.       

249
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:25,790
    ...some of Sammy Hagar's    
  tequila from his old company  

250
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,858
    which I'm now in business   
      with the new company,     

251
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:30,328
    but you drank half of it,   
    and then you send to me,    

252
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:31,596
       and you duct-taped       
         the top on it.         

253
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:34,732
    Yeah, pretty much exactly   
       what happened. Yup.      

254
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,669
    -It's a full-blown pizza.   
        -He sent a pizza?       

255
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:39,537
    I threw a pizza in there.   

256
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:42,374
   Hey, we're making burgers.   
      But who wants pizza?      

257
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,609
   Oh, wait, there's a letter.  

258
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:46,944
 Enclosed you'll find some info 
        on how to prepare       

259
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:51,416
        the Cinco Diablo        
   from Paradise Valley Burger  
      in Phoenix, Arizona.      

260
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,419
     Anybody should be able     
      to get this. [laughs]     

261
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,954
   -That was my favorite one.   
           -[laughing]          

262
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:59,023
 We have hit a new level today. 
       What are we making?      

263
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:02,159
      [Bret]<i> So we're doing</i>     
       <i> the Cinco Diablo</i>        
      <i> five chili burger.</i>       

264
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:03,828
    Two different dimensions    
      for you guys to make.     

265
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,029
    <i> The Fresno chili pesto.</i>    

266
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,766
 <i> Then I have a jalapeno ranch</i>  
<i>you guys can rock and roll on.</i>  

267
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:10,635
           Let's start          
  with the Fresno chili pesto.  

268
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:12,771
    So I have Fresno chilies    
  that are roasted right here.  

269
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:15,573
    [Bret] Basil, olive oil,    
            parmesan,           

270
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:18,309
         -peanut butter.        
       -Wait, wait, wait.       
     Peanut butter, really?     

271
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:20,712
  Yes, sir, and a little bit of 
   salt and pepper of course,   

272
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,049
  and then the roasted red bell 
   peppers. That should be on   
     the money right there.     

273
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:27,585
   -What can we start on next?  
  -The pickled serrano chilies  
            we like.            

274
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:28,920
  I got sliced serrano chilies  
           over here,           

275
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:31,589
     hook it up with some of    
 the tequila, about half a cup, 

276
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:33,525
     and then freestyle some    
         sugar in there.        

277
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:35,794
  Freestyle? Okay. Freestyling  
           the sugar.           

278
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:39,197
       [Bret] Some cumin.       
   Squeeze a lime up in there.  

279
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:43,001
      Fresno pesto is done,     
  which is gorgeous by the way. 

280
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,002
     -What's the next step?     
       -Beer batter up the      
         poblano pepper.        

281
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:48,739
  Flour and beer, super simple. 
     Take the roasted green     
          chilly there,         

282
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:51,942
  I like to salt them a little  
    bit first and then flour    
        and then batter.        

283
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:55,346
             -Okay.             
   -Finally, Chef, will be the  
         jalapeno ranch.        

284
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,749
      We're gonna take the      
      heavy cream, you got      
         your jalapenos.        

285
00:11:57,751 --> 00:12:00,818
         -All the mayo.         
      -And then granulated      
    onion, bread and garlic.    

286
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:03,621
       -Light salt pepper.      
 -And then this gets pureed up? 

287
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:04,756
        [Bret] Yes, sir.        

288
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:07,492
 [Guy] Hunter's got his batter, 
      he can start frying.      

289
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,828
     Toast nice and crispy.     

290
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:13,832
   Alright, brother, I'm done   
    with the jalapeno ranch,    
       don't go anywhere,       

291
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,502
     Paradise Valley Burger,    
        one in a million.

   <i> We got burgers coming up.</i>   

293
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:27,978
          Welcome back,         
   <i> Triple D</i> in the backyard.   

294
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:30,982
    We're right in the middle   
    of it folks, making this    
         Cinco Diablo...        

295
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:33,384
    -What is it called again,   
              Bret?             
         -Cinco Diablo.         

296
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,787

  <i> at Paradise Valley Burger.</i>   

297
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:38,122
     Hunter just took these     
        roasted poblanos,       

298
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:41,725
     then out them in a nice    
    beer batter. Are we ready   
  to make the burger yet, bro?  

299
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:45,263
       Rock and roll, man.      
      Take our squared bun,     
      little bit of butter      

300
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:49,200
  get those on the flat top and 
    get our patties rocking,    
  it's a two two-ounce patties. 

301
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:53,071
       -Season them with?       
 -Salt and pepper, I like a lot 
  of lettuce on the bottom bun  

302
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:56,140
  -to stop from a soggy burger. 
         -Burger's over.        

303
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:59,877
   [Bret] A little bit of the   
      light jalapeno ranch,     
      chipotle bacon is...      

304
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,880
     <i> bacon just rubbed in</i>      
     <i> chipotle, backed off,</i>     

305
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,747
<i>so it's got a little blackened</i>  
    <i> vibe going on with it.</i>     

306
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:06,884
   And then a little bit more   
   ranch, so that the poblanos  
      sticks to the ranch.      

307
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:10,555
           -Beautiful.          
       Fresno chili pesto.      
          -Now avocado?         

308
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,559
    -[Bret] Kinda fan it out.   
   -We're having some very big  
  height challenge issues here. 

309
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,027
               Oh!              

310
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:20,431
  And then a few of the serrano 
     chilies and then a nice    
        cilantro garnish,       

311
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,399
         and that is it.        

312
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:25,069
  I... the diameter of this...  

313
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,772
   Nice. Good form gentlemen.   

314
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:33,377
            -Hold on.           
      The poblanos are hot.     
         -[all laughing]        

315
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:34,845
    That ranch cools it down.   

316
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:37,582
    The Fresno chilly pesto,    
        that's a screamer       
        right there, bro.       

317
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,718
 Delicious meat, I love the fry 
  and crunch from the poblano.  

318
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:44,989
  The chipotle on the bacon and 
    brother, you are without    
    question, the real deal.    

319
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:49,661
     -Well done. Your man's     
       bowing in the back.      
        -[all applauding]       

320
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:51,729
   The next place we're gonna   
       check out, Hunter,       

321
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:56,066
   has the deli case the size   
     of Burger Man's energy     
          and attitude.         

322
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:59,871
 <i> It's up in Portland, Oregon.</i>  
    <i> Every time I go there,</i>     
  <i> I come to visit the place.</i>   

323
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:01,873
      You're gonna love it.     
         This is Otto's.        

324
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:05,410
      Holy moly, it's like      
     meat Disneyland. Whoa!     

325
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:07,679
   -And we're making sausages.  
          -Yes we are.          

326
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:11,949
  -Whoa, Can't you just make it 
    come a little bit slower?   
             -I did.            

327
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:15,286
     Christie, when was it?     
  You were still in high school 
        when I was there.       

328
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,487
   I think it was, like, 2008.  

329
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:18,022
  [Guy]<i> How many family members</i> 
          <i> work there?</i>          

330
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:21,492
 [Jerry]<i> Mom and Dad, the three</i> 
       <i> daughters and two</i>       
      <i> of their husbands.</i>       

331
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,827
       [Guy] I want to see      
        what you sent us,       

332
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:26,564
       I know this is got       
         so much history        
     and so much background.    

333
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,233
   How long has this all been   
             going?             

334
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:30,835
    We're gonna be pushing a    
     100 years here in about    
       an year and a half.      

335
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:36,174
    -What are we gonna make?    
   -A South African boerewors   
   and apple chicken sausage.   

336
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:38,776
      We have our nice new      
     grinder out here, that     
        we've never used.       

337
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:41,379
    So, let's start off with    
      the boerewors first.      

338
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,914
        -What've we got?        
      -[Jerry] Beef chuck.      

339
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:46,050
  I think you're gonna have to  
 dice it up a little bit to get 
      through your grinder.     

340
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:50,188
  You see what I don't have is  
  the size machinery that they  
      have there at Otto's.     

341
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:54,359
    Whoa! That's the biggest    
    buffalo chopper I've ever   
     seen. Fire in the hole!    

342
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:56,995
         That's awesome.        

343
00:14:56,997 --> 00:15:00,798
   It's quite the production.   
    I've got all the beef and   
           pork loin.           

344
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:04,002
    -Season it now in a bowl.   
  -Peppers in. Salt's going in. 

345
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,069
            Allspice.           

346
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:09,207
 -[Hunter] Brown sugar. Cloves. 
       -Coriander, nutmeg.      

347
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:10,608
      And red wine vinegar.     

348
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,110
            -Hunter?            
              -Yep.             

349
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:13,877
        Impressive, Guy.        

350
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:16,080
 -Where's the recipe come from? 
       -This guy was from       
          South Africa,         

351
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:21,752
  James Collier, and he brought 
    in packages of boerewors    
            seasoning           

352
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:25,490
    and wanted me to make it,   
   it was delicious and so we   
  came up with our own recipe.  

353
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:26,958
     And right on the top of    
           this meat?           

354
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:30,494
  That put it in a bowl so you  
     can mix it together and    
       not lose too much.       

355
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:33,097
     See, Hunter, that's why    
     they're making sausage,    

356
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,899
 and we're standing here acting 
   like we're making sausage.   

357
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:38,636
 -There you go, okay, let's see 
    how this starts working.    
           -Oh, yeah.           

358
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,571
     You wanna keep the meat    
   flowing through you grinder  

359
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,907
       because that's what      
        cools your plate.       

360
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:46,844
     -We're rookies, Jerry.     
   -We deal with a 100 pounds,  
    you only got five pounds.   

361
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:48,780
 -Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
        -[Jerry laughing]       

362
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,248
      -[Hunter] We're gonna     
           case this?           
              -Yes.             

363
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,918
 -Jer, which size am I wanting? 
     -You're gonna want the     
          smaller horn.         

364
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:55,853
 Okay, you're gonna have to get 
      more water in there.      

365
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:58,589
    You're gonna need a good    
       slurry you what to       
         go through it.         

366
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:02,593
    It's gotta slide on easy,   
  otherwise it's not gonna come 
  off easy. You're getting it.  

367
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:06,264
  And I don't need to tie this  
    off, right? I need to let   
      my air come through?      

368
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:07,732
       You got that right.      

369
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:12,537
  See, Jer, I paid attention a  
  little bit when we did this.  
        Okay, here we go.       

370
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:14,072
   Just put it all on the top.  

371
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,741
  We're learning here as we go, 
      we're trying to work      
         as a team, Jer.        

372
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,945
   -I'm starting to get a full  
         cased one now.         
       -That's beautiful.       

373
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:24,615
       I'm not saying that      
        Hunter and I are        
   doing it any Otto style...   

374
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:27,351
        -We're not pros.        
      -But I think for our      
          maiden voyage         

375
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,820
 on our little countertop unit, 

376
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:31,822
 -that didn't come out too bad. 
      -Looks awesome to me.     

377
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:35,827
 Let's just saute it in the pan 
   with little oil, get a nice  
          brown to it.          

378
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:40,764
      So, one sausage down,     
     but don't go anywhere,     
     we're gonna cook this,     

379
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:43,167
  -we're gonna get the grinder  
  cleaned up, that's your job.  
            -No, no.            

380
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:45,169
 We're gonna make chicken apple 
   sausage, see you in a bit.   

381
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:48,772
 -Alright, now I'll watch this, 
            you go...           
 -No, no, no. I'm already here. 

382
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,275
  -Go clean, go clean. Alright. 
         -I got the pan,        
         I put in there.        

383
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,649
     Welcome back,<i> Triple D</i>     
        in the backyard.        

384
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:01,118
  We're doing a little takeout, 
   we got some of our favorite  

385
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,853
      <i> Triple D</i> chefs from      
       around the country.      

386
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:06,924
 We went to Paradise Valley and 
  had a fantastic burger, we've 
   been right down the street   

387
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:11,128
  here in northern California,  
      with our sister Alma,     
         at La Texanita.        

388
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:14,932

       <i> Portland, Oregon.</i>       

390
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:19,137
     -We're making sausage.     
           -High five.          

391
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,004
              Yeah.             

392
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:23,474
     Okay, so now we're into    
     chicken apple sausage.     

393
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,144
    We cut up all the breast    
       and all the thigh.       

394
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:29,747
 We got to cut those two apples 
       up and de-core 'em,      
       leave the skin on.       

395
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:33,751
    Ground ginger, going in,    
      cinnamon... niminim.      

396
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:36,354
     Chicken apple salt, or     
       this is just salt.       

397
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,289
           -Just salt.          
    -I think it's just salt.    

398
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,158
     I didn't know, I mean,     
         maybe you have         
     special salt up there.     

399
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,695
    We got some fresh cracked   
  black pepper, onion, this is  
 coriander going in right here. 

400
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:47,899
      And a little nutmeg.      
    Is there a liquid that's    
        going into this?        

401
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:52,570
    No it'll be plenty moist.   
  Hunter, I think you could've  
       used a bigger bowl.      

402
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,306
              -I...             
      -We're just learning      
        that now, Jerry.        

403
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:57,641
   This is a learning process,  
              okay?             

404
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,978
   It sure likes it here when   
   it's nice and easy chicken   

405
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,514
      to run through it and     
    a couple of apple chunks.   

406
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,316
     [Jerry] We're gonna use    
      the same port casing.     

407
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:06,984
     Hunter, I cased it for     
            you, son.           

408
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:08,986
   Thank you, that's... You're  
  a good father. Ready to roll?

00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:12,456
  -[Guy] Let's give her a shot. 
       -We're rocking and       
          rolling now.          

410
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:14,458
      -You got to do this.      
       -Wait, wait, wait.       

411
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:16,060
        -Got to do that.        
          -Wait, wait.          

412
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:19,863
  I have to check the sausage.  
     We've African boerewors    
   cooking here low and slow.   

413
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:23,401
   I don't know how to do it,   
       do I just hold it?       

414
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:26,871
       -Nice job, Hunter.       
   -There we go. Now are these  
     supposed to be linked?     

415
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:28,805
      Right. Just use your      
           fingertips.          

416
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:32,610
   -Nice and easy, that's what  
    we're looking for, right?   
    -[Jerry] Looks beautiful.   

417
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:36,013
    [Christie] Put them in a    
      160 degree water bath     
         for 30 minutes.        

418
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:40,418
       Since it's chicken,      
  you want a nice thorough cook 
  and water transfers the heat  

419
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:41,685
       so much better than      
          just the pan.         

420
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:44,821
     [Guy] Once you're done,    
     bring them out put them    
            in a pan,           

421
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:49,960
     and this is the African    
  boerewors sausage, a toasted  
     bun, look at that, huh?    

422
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:52,763
       -[Hunter] Love it.       
       -[Guy] How do these      
         get plated up?         

423
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:55,098
       With Onion add some      
       Dusseldorf mustard.      

424
00:18:55,168 --> 00:19:00,104
     -Is Dusseldorf blow the    
  top of your head off mustard? 
              -No.              

425
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:05,343
   Okay, so this is top round   
      pork loin, a variety      
           of spices.           

426
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:09,847
    Wait, wait, wait, you're    
    taking a bite without me?   

427
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:13,718
    What I like in particular   
      about this, is I like     
         funky flavors.         

428
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,787
  I want that red wine vinegar  
   in there, you know, I want   
           that tang.           

429
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:20,057
     I want that funk of the    
   coriander, of the allspice.  

430
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:21,925
       -Cloves, all that.       
          -It has that,

00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:25,329
       <i> "Oh, my goodness,</i>       
   <i> I'm a big meal inside of</i>    
      <i> a little package."</i>       

432
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:26,664
    [Hunter] It's delicious.    

433
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,999
    That Dusseldorf mustard,    
           my new fav.          

434
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:32,937
    We're also making chicken   
  apple and going with this is  
        the potato salad.       

435
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:34,871
  -What's in the potato salad?  
   -[Christie] Otto's bacon...  

436
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:37,341
  -Because, of course you make  
     your own bacon, right.     
           -Of course.          

437
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:43,481
   Onion, apple cider vinegar,  
    beef broth, black pepper,   
    add some Maggi seasoning.   

438
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:46,150
           -Delicious.          
  -Now, on the chicken apple... 

439
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:51,022
 what you get there is a little 
 bit of sweet, a good amount of 
      cinnamon and nutmeg.      

440
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:54,959
  -It's tender, there's enough  
   fat in there it's not dry.   
             -Right.            

441
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:59,029
     A lot of apple, I think    
     leaving the peel on the    
      apple's the real key.     

442
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:02,633
  -The kind of spiced apple now 
   with all the spices there.   
             -It is.            

443
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:05,703
