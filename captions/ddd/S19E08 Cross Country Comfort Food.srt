1
00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:03,268
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,671
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

3
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:07,672
          This trip...          

4
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,141
    That's the way to do it.    

5
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:10,141
  We're crossing the country... 

6
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:12,077
      Black-tar Texas tea.      

7
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:14,012
  ...for some classic comfort.  

8
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,147
     I can't say it's good,     

9
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:16,882
    but I can say it's great,   
             though.            

10
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:18,884
      In Miami, Florida...      

11
00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:20,085
           Fire it up.          

12
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:21,286
    ...a blue-collar joint...   

13
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:22,888
You look like you could've been 
        The Big Ragoo.          

14
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,623
          ...serving up         
      some decadent dishes.     

15
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,025
  That is some awesome oxtail.  

16
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,628
 Then west of Park City, Utah...

17
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,163
      Let's hit this, man.      

18
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:33,298
       ...where a ski bum       
       takes a wild run...      

19
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,433
           That's one           
     of the weirdest dishes     

20
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:36,034
  I've ever seen on "Triple D." 

21
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,703
      ...down a crazy trail     
         to Flavortown.         

22
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,706
      It is funky comfort.      
 I will give you that, brother. 

23
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,708
 And a few miles up the road... 

24
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,576
   [ Singing, German accent ]   
     Roll out the spaetzel.     

25
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:46,912
 ...some cold-weather comfort...

26
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:48,714
  Listen, you say "pork belly," 
       I say "thank you."       

27
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:50,049
         ...slope side.         

28
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:52,584
   Have you ever seen a place   
   at the bottom of a ski run   

29
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:54,052
    that has food like this?    

30
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,320
                            No. 
         I rest my case,        
           your honor.          

31
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:58,857
     That's all right here,     
    right now, on "Triple D."   

34
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:15,407
        So, I'm in Miami        
in a very historic Art-Deco area

35
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,075
        about 10 minutes        
        from South Beach,       

36
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,543
          and I'm here          
      to check out a joint      

37
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:21,013
     that is located in a...    
          wait for it.          

38
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:24,349
    Is it in a business park,   
      is it in a high-rise,     

39
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:29,421
           or is it in          
  a soon-to-be-remodeled hotel? 

40
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:33,825
      Hey, well, listen --      
 don't judge a book by its cover

41
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,693
    'cause I hear this joint    
        is off the hook.        

42
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:36,662
      This is Blue Collar.      

43
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:41,033
        Shrimp and grits.       

44
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:42,767
      The best in Florida.      

45
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,603
        Everything packs        
 like an immediate flavor punch.

46
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:47,506
   One of Miami's hidden gems.  

47
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:52,444
    FIERI: A reputation owner   
  Danny Serfer's had since 2012 

48
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:56,648
   when he started serving up   
      flavors locals love.      

49
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,985
     He's got Miami's palate    
   right on his little finger.  

50
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:01,520
         Oxtail on one.         

51
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:03,255
      MAN: The spicy oxtail     
       is a Haitian dish,       

52
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:05,456
so it's not really traditionally
     seen outside of Miami.     

53
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,192
   It just drips off the bone,  

54
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:09,261
          the juice is          
    in your mashed potatoes,    

55
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:12,598
  and you just suck it all up.  

56
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,465
                 Fire it up.    

57
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,866
                Nice oxtail.    

58
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,602
   SERFER: People,              
they go crazy about it.         

59
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:17,936
               Salt and pepper  
                those tails?    
   Always.                      

60
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:20,072
  We're just gonna              
brown them up real good,        

61
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:21,806
       get all                  
that caramelization going.      

62
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,075
             All right, next up.

63
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:25,210
   Take them out.               

64
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:26,545
                    Mmm.        

65
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:29,080
           You've got some nice 
     rendered fat down in there.

66
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,283
Now all that stuff, we're gonna 
cook our vegetables in.         

67
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:33,218
   Carrots. Onion.              

68
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,087
            Boatloads of garlic.

69
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:36,888
Scotch bonnet. Celery.          

70
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,423
      Mango.                    
                       Mango?   

71
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:39,891
It kind of tempers the heat     
      a little.                 

72
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,293
       Thyme.                   

73
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:43,095
  Salt and pepper.              

74
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:46,298
We'll hit it with wine          
and then just dump them back in.

75
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:50,035
      Take these, cook them down
           four to seven hours? 

76
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:52,370
        Yep.                    

77
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:56,374
   Couple dollops               
of our mashed potatoes.         

78
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:57,376
                 "Dollops."     

79
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:58,644
    Some oxtail.                

80
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:00,712
   Oh, those really cooked down.
                Look at that.   

81
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:02,113
        Yeah.                   

82
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,582
   Little bit more              
    of the juice.               

83
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,451
 And then the bread             
    for dipping.                

84
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:08,187
       Chives.                  

85
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:12,724
                    Mmm.        

86
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:15,193
      You've got massive flavor,

87
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,728
                  but with      
        that little bit of spice

88
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,932
   and that little bit of sweet 
  that you get on there -- dude.

89
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:21,466
                    Mmm.        

90
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,735
                Killer, man.    
               Excellent job.   
Thank you.                      

91
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:25,504
         That is awesome oxtail.

92
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,407
    It kicked me in the mouth   
      just like it's an ox.     

93
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,677
             WOMAN:             
 This has very high-quality food

94
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,645
      for an up-and-coming      
          neighborhood.         

95
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,149
      What this area is --      
  it's filled with young Miami. 

96
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,351
         We're not rich.        
        We're not famous.       

97
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,486
        So, we're trying        
        to find somewhere       

98
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:42,554
    that we can make our own.   

99
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,355
             FIERI:             
  And Danny's helping the cause 

100
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:45,556
     by giving the customers    

101
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,160
        a badge of honor        
    with a Blue Collar twist.   

102
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:50,229
     WOMAN: The regulars get    
   their own little time card   

103
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:51,363
        with their name.        

104
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:52,630
     It's like, you know, --    

105
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,566
So, you're part of the club     
once you have a time card.      

106
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,700
     I like it.                 

107
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,502
        FIERI: And along        
   with the lunch-pail decor,   

108
00:03:57,504 --> 00:04:00,706
     Danny's cooking up this    
stick-to-your-ribs monster meal.

109
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,307
             WOMAN:             
       Big Ragoo sandwich.      

110
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:04,843
   FIERI: A hot mess of cheese  
     and five kinds of meat.    

111
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:07,245
       I just go in for it      
       and just get messy.      

112
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,181
 You look like you could've been
               The Big Ragoo.   

113
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:12,784
       SERFER:                  
First thing we're gonna do --   
 season our brisket.            

114
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:15,120
Just add a little bit of oil    
  to get it going.              

115
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:17,922
You're gonna sear it            
   on both sides,               

116
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,125
and it's nice to do things      
     in one pot.                

117
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:22,461
         One pot. Builds flavor.

118
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:23,729
                 Same thing     
         with the pork shoulder?
Yep.                            

119
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:26,465
   Season it up,                
   fat-side down.               

120
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:27,399
                 All right.     

121
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:28,667
Pork is nice and brown.         

122
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:30,202
Locally made sausage.           

123
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:31,069
                    Italian?    
     Yep.                       

124
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,604
                  Pancetta?     
    Yep.                        

125
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,140
     This is                    
some veal shoulder.             
                      Love that.

126
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:36,341
  Salt and pepper.              

127
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:38,877
             All kinds of flavor
              down in that pan. 

128
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,011
We'll render that down          
    a little bit                

129
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,281
and then start cooking          
the rest of our vegetables.     

130
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:43,481
       Onions.                  

131
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,682
    Whole garlic.               

132
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,484
        That's the way to do it.

133
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,019
                Chili flake.    

134
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,821
    Pepper. Salt.               

135
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:52,024
                     Tomato?    
        Yep.                    
 This is a San Marzano.         

136
00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:53,892
                   I love       
            where this is going.

137
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:56,561
Now we're gonna start           
adding everything else back in. 

138
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,963
And add a little bit            
      of water.                 

139
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,766
                   Tell me      
      that's corn starch slurry.

140
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:02,233
   It's just milk.              
                         Really?

141
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,036
I learned it from, like,        
an old Italian person.          

142
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:07,305
The lactose in the milk is      
gonna help break down the meat, 

143
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,708
and it's gonna help it          
pull apart and shred up.        

144
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,043
           I'm gonna go try that
           just because of that.

145
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,712
                 All right,     
  how long is this gonna simmer?

146
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,180
  Six, seven hours.             

147
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:17,182
Then we're gonna kind of        
treat it like a pulled pork,    

148
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,917
and we're just gonna            
rip it apart with our tongs.    

149
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:22,387
Hit it with a little bit        
  of tomato sauce.              

150
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:25,724
    That's a nice               
 seeded hoagie roll.            

151
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,659
   And you see that nice little,
              salty provolone?  

152
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,927
             Now into the oven. 
            Let the cheese melt.

153
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,396
                Are we ready?   
    Yep.                        

154
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:35,600
             That's ridiculous. 

155
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:36,735
    It's way big.               

156
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:44,343
                  Mmmmmmm.      

157
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:49,614
        There is so much flavor.

158
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,682
   You got a little bit of spice
         in there -- very rich. 

159
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,218
                The awesome,    
               awesome bread.   

160
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,088
        Look at that -- you got 
little bits of sausage in there,

161
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,489
        little bits of the veal.

162
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:59,024
            That sharp provolone
               coming through   

163
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,425
             with the saltiness 
                   on top.      

164
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:02,093
        I would die to have that
                 over pasta.    

165
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,762
Come back for dinner.           
                      [ Scoffs ]

166
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:06,431
           Oh, my God,          
  that's a good-looking Ragoo.  

167
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:07,833
        That is a Ragoo.        

168
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:10,368
   This sandwich, oh, my gosh.  

169
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,971
 It's almost like you're eating 
      a delicious lasagna,      

170
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,572
         but with, like,        
        much better meat.       

171
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,641
      So, these are some friends
       of mine, the Fox family. 

172
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:18,110
      You've been to a bunch of 
 "Triple D" joints, haven't you?

173
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:19,711
   Yes.                         
               What do you think
                 of this place? 

174
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,513
Great.                          
      It's one of the best.     

175
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,114
           Well done, my friend.

176
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,116
       Thanks.                  
                      Awesome.  

177
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,453
             FIERI:             
 Coming up, we're road tripping 
      to Park City, Utah...     

178
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:29,854
      Let's hit this, man.      

179
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,589
    ...for a hardcore skier's   
             turn...            

180
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,925
   I mean, you're funky, bro.   
         You're daring.         

181
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:36,194
  ...on some righteous dishes.  

182
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:38,063
  That's like a $10 lift ticket 
         to Flavortown.         

183
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:48,740
 I'm here at Prospector's Square
       at Park City, Utah,      

184
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,274
          and I'm right         
     in the thick of things.    

185
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:53,144
Let's see -- half mile that way,
   Park City Mountain Resort.   

186
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,146
     About a mile that way,     
          Deer Valley.          

187
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:58,216
  I'm here to check out a joint 
 where a local boy slash ski bum

188
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:01,419
  has a motto of "Gourmet Food  
       at Local's Prices."      

189
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,455
     This is Sammy's Bistro.    

190
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,359
    When you come to Sammy's,   
   you get a home-cooked meal.  

191
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,829
  Steak sandwich and fish tacos 
         in the window.         

192
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:12,631
         You could spend        
    a lot more money in town,   

193
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,432
 but you won't get better food. 

194
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,301
    FIERI: That was the idea    
  for Chef and owner Sam Harris 

195
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:19,838
  who opened this joint in 2011 
       for his compadres,       

196
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,772
           which means          
     ski pants and hat hair     

197
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,109
    are definitely expected.    

198
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,844
                 Do you ski?    
                Do you board?   
 Oh, I'm a skier.               

199
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:27,779
                 Very nice.     

200
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,648
I competed at Moguls            
  back in the day.              

201
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,449
             That could explain 

202
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,718
      Sammy's freestyle approach
               in the kitchen.  

203
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,720
I put a bunch of ideas          
into a manilla envelope         

204
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:37,122
when we were starting up        
   the restaurant,              

205
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,456
     and I just                 
  pulled stuff out.             

206
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,791
   I had probably               
  100 to 200 ideas.             

207
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,726
         The pulled pork        
     is one of my favorites.    

208
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,528
            My go-to            
   is the mahimahi fish taco.   

209
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,731
             FIERI:             
  And then there's the creation 
that sounds like a bunny hill...

210
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:47,866
      Savory chicken bowl.      

211
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:49,868
       FIERI: ...but rocks      
      black-diamond flavor.     

212
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,670
  It's got the chicken and then 
that wonderful cilantro dressing

213
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,606
       and then the crunch      
        of the tortillas.       

214
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:56,908
       HARRIS:                  
Savory chicken bowl.            

215
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,009
        Show me what you've got.

216
00:07:58,011 --> 00:07:59,744
 Little canola oil.             

217
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,880
      Poblano.                  

218
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:03,081
     And onions.                

219
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,483
Put a little garlic in          
and then the chicken            

220
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,751
  and then coat it              
    with spices.                

221
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:08,553
    Yellow curry.               
    Garam masala.               

222
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,154
      Paprika.                  
This is onion powder.           

223
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,156
 Salt.                          
      And a little black pepper.

224
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,691
 So, get the spices             
coating the chicken,            

225
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,760
and then just hit some water    
       on top.                  

226
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:18,896
    Let it simmer               
for two to three hours.         

227
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,565
        Until it's super tender.

228
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,767
    Super-tender                
   pulled chicken.              

229
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,302
                    Okay,       
        so the chicken's cooked.

230
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:25,570
                 Now we put     
             the bowl together? 
  Yep.                          

231
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:28,172
Some tortilla strips.           

232
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,175
    Jasmine rice.               

233
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,442
We ladle our chicken.           

234
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:34,111
Some of the tortilla strips     
       on top.                  

235
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,180
    Make it tall.               

236
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,715
      Cilantro.                 

237
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:40,852
   And finish off               
with the tomatillo aioli.       

238
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,054
         You don't wear a helmet
          when you ski, do you? 

239
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,722
   I have to now.               
My fiancée makes me.            

240
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,057
                 That's one     
          of the weirdest dishes

241
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,192
               I've ever seen   
               on "Triple D."   

242
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,527
   You just throw               
 something together.            

243
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,461
Sometimes it turns out.         
So, this one is one of those.   

244
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,930
                There we go.    
              How do I eat it?  

245
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,999
  Just mash it up.              
  Make it happen.               

246
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,235
Try to get a little bit         
   of everything.               

247
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:01,940
         Chicken's super tender.

248
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:04,142
              It almost turns   
              into a jambalaya  

249
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:07,878
        crossed with some crazy 
     Indian dish I've never had.

250
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,880
Comfort food at its finest,     
      you know?                 

251
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,350
            It is funky comfort.

252
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:14,819
           I will give you that,
                  brother.      

253
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:16,555
                    Mmm.        
              How much is this? 

254
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,423
      10 bucks.                 

255
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:21,092
     It's like a $10 lift ticket
               to Flavortown.   

256
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:23,628
    MAN: Savory chicken bowl    
           with rice.           

257
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,763
     It's comfort in a bowl.    

258
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:26,230
                 That's why     
             I love this place. 

259
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,365
         It's super comfortable.

260
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,034
                  It's like     
             being in a Jacuzzi.

261
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:30,501
      Time out.                 

262
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,437
So, we're in a Jacuzzi          
     right now?                 

263
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:34,105
                Pretty much.    

264
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:35,774
       Sammy's is a place       
      where the locals go.      

265
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:37,042
   It's almost like "Cheers."   

266
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:38,843
           You walk in          
  and you always know somebody. 

267
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:40,177
             FIERI:             
 But when it comes to the menu, 

268
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,781
       he definitely heads      
        way out of town.        

269
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:44,849
        The Chivito club.       

270
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:46,250
                The who club?   

271
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,119
The Chivito club.               
                  Who's Chivito?

272
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:50,455
Chivito is a sandwich           
    from Uruguay.               

273
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:52,657
            Let's hit this, man.

274
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:55,326
We're gonna make the marinade   
for the pork tenderloin --      

275
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,327
    canola oil...               

276
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,195
    soy sauce...                

277
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:59,063
      garlic...                 

278
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,498
      ginger...                 

279
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,599
     cilantro...                

280
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,934
    fresh limes.                

281
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,936
 And how long is this tenderloin
               gonna marinate?  

282
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:09,073
  Oh, we usually do             
   45 to an hour.               

283
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,609
                  Grill it.     

284
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:11,943
   Yep.                         
            Medium-rare? Medium?

285
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,878
       Medium.                  

286
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,814
   And let it rest              
    for a minute.               

287
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,216
And while we do that,           
we're gonna make the egg.       

288
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,488
                  Hey, hey!     
  He'll be here all week, folks.

289
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,092
   Slice it thin.               

290
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:28,360
      And then                  
it's on a hoagie roll.          

291
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:30,629
So, we have a little bit        
of the tomatillo aioli,         

292
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,632
  lettuce, tomato,              

293
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,034
  pork tenderloin,              

294
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:39,671
and little bit of bacon         
and some spicy mayo.            

295
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,646
     All right,                 
and the egg is missing.         

296
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,315
          [ Laughter ]          

297
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,717
  Where's the egg?              

298
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,452
That's the good question.       
                    Looks good. 
                  Let's have it.

299
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:55,587
Hey, it's perfect now,          
       right?                   

300
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:59,457
    There it is.                
Throw a little fried egg on top.

301
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,125
     Little more                
  tomatillo aioli.              

302
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,194
 Can't get enough               
 of that sauce.                 
                  No, you can't.

303
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,729
             Good-looking fries.

304
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:08,833
       Here is                  
  our chivito club.             

305
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:17,008
              The seasoned pork 
             has way more flavor

306
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,078
             than I anticipated 
 with the garlic and the ginger.

307
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,613
             But I really think 
               that the kicker  

308
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,649
                   is that      
       tomatillo-cilantro aioli.

309
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:30,688
         Even with egg on there,
         it's a great sandwich. 

310
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,756
                   I mean,      
             you're funky, bro. 

311
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:32,823
               You're daring.   

312
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:33,891
              You're like that. 

313
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,827
  Make it happen --             
  That's my mantra.             

314
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,328
               Nicely done, bro.
Thanks, man.                    

315
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,232
    The pork is very tender.    

316
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,634
  It's like breakfast and lunch 
      all at the same time.     

317
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,303
              MAN:              
      The taste is gourmet.     

318
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:46,771
   The prices are reasonable.   

319
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:48,440
          You could be          
    from out of town visiting   

320
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:51,176
   and you're gonna feel like   
   you're part of Park City.    

321
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:52,110
         Watch out for this guy.

322
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:53,578
              When you see him  
               on the slopes,   

323
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,781
       if he skis like he cooks,
               take a day off.  

324
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:59,050
        FIERI: Up next...       

325
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,652
      Boom, boom, mushroom.     

326
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:03,654
  ...we're staying at Park City 
    and heading slope side...   

327
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,256
      Wow! At a ski resort.     

328
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,192
   ...where a hidden joint...   

329
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:08,860
    You've got sweet and heat   
     on meat you can't beat.    

330
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:11,596
        ...is blowing up        
      the after-ski action.     

331
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:15,133
 Mexican, Texan, Southern combo 
    with a twist -- elevated.   

332
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:16,301
     Really easy to explain.    

333
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:25,442
  I'm here at Park City, Utah,  
  at the Silver Star Village,   

334
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:28,046
   which is right at the base   
  of Park City Mountain Resort. 

335
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,113
 Now, I know that's a mouthful, 

336
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,448
         but I want you         
       to find this place       

337
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,916
          'cause I hear         
     they're doing way more     

338
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,717
         than you'd find        
   at your average ski lodge.   

339
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,286
  This is the Silver Star Café. 

340
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,658
         Got a sea bass         
     and osso bucco for 112.    

341
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,394
      The best place to eat     
    in Park City -- bar none.   

342
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:44,729
     And braised short rib.     

343
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:46,331
 MAN: There really is something 
      that makes this place     

344
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,666
      special in Park City,     
     and it's Jeff and Lisa.    

345
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:50,869
  FIERI: That would be veterans 
      of the local food biz     

346
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:52,069
       Jeff and Lisa Ward.      

347
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:54,472
   I've been doing restaurants  
    in town for a long time.    

348
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:56,074
We've never owned one ourselves.
       We took the plunge.      

349
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:59,811
     FIERI: That was in 2010    
 when they took over this joint 

350
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:02,146
          at the bottom         
 of the Silver Star chair lift. 

351
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,815
      We're a local joint,      
      but we resonate with      
    the destination visitor.    

352
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:09,153
             FIERI:             
   Thanks to an eclectic menu   
  cooked up by Chef Dave Bible. 

353
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,622
    Comfort food                
brought to a higher level.      

354
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,891
   It's familiar,               
but with some twists to it.     

355
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,293
   I have the pork osso bucco.  

356
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,828
               Pork osso bucco  

357
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,831
         with tomatillo salsa --
              Mexican Italian.  

358
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,834
The first thing we're gonna make
is the roasted-tomatillo salsa. 

359
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:24,969
Start off with some oil         
     in the pan.                

360
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,704
  Chopped onions...             

361
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:29,106
    tomatillos...               

362
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:30,841
 poblano chilies...             

363
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,243
       salt...                  

364
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:34,378
       pepper.                  

365
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,648
  We'll cook these              
for about 20 minutes.           

366
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,449
All the vegetables are cooked.  
 Add chicken stock.             

367
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:40,718
It's a roasted chicken stock,   
and I used tomato paste.        

368
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,319
  You kind of get               
  like a brown --               
                      I got you.

369
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,222
Then just Burr mix it.          

370
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,865
           The tomatillo salsa's
                  done now.     

371
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:55,133
Now we're gonna start           
  our pork shanks.              

372
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:56,934
First thing I'm gonna do        
   is season them.              

373
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,003
Lots of salt and pepper.        
That's pretty important.        

374
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:02,140
  Little bit of oil             
     in the pan.                

375
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:03,808
Throw a little vegetable on here
 so these will roast            

376
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,209
  at the same time              
 as the pork browns.            

377
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,078
And then I place the pork.      

378
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:12,350
 And we're gonna roast these off
      in the oven at what temp? 

379
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,084
Right about 560 degrees.        

380
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:16,187
     About seven                
  or eight minutes.             

381
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,893
               So, we're done   
               being roasted?   
Yes, sir.                       

382
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:23,528
So, I'm gonna place them        
    into the pan.               

383
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,900
Put the veg in the pan.         

384
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:30,902
         Homemade chicken stock?
Yep.                            

385
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:35,640
             Foil this back up. 
  Put it back in the pizza oven?

386
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:37,976
Yes, sir, for three hours.      

387
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:39,510
      It's like                 
 Christmas morning.             

388
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:40,778
 I'm gonna go ahead             
    and plate it.               

389
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,046
    So, I've got                
these chipotle grits --         

390
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,581
    yellow grits                
spiked with chipotle.           

391
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,316
              My middle name's  
               chipotle grit.   

392
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:46,917
                 Very nice.     

393
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,186
                       Gorgeous.
Load one of the shanks          
 on there.                      

394
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,654
Got the tomatillo salsa.        

395
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,658
Already hot. Ready to roll.     

396
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,993
Just a little garnish           
  of queso fresco,              

397
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,062
  just a little bit             
of chopped cilantro.            

398
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:01,499
And there we are -- That's      
the pork osso bucco with        
roasted-tomatillo salsa.        

399
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:08,806
                 Outrageous.    

400
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:10,675
                Nice acidity    
         in the tomatillo salsa.

401
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:12,610
       Pork's fall-apart tender.

402
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:14,279
          Love the poblano note.

403
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:17,214
                The grits...    
              pull you into it. 

404
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:21,019
            Good Mexican, Texan,
               Southern combo   

405
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:22,353
               with a twist --  
                  elevated.     

406
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:23,487
         Really easy to explain.

407
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,156
            Chef, great energy. 
           Great food. Nice job.

408
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,758
  Appreciate that.              
Thank you very much.            

409
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,860
           Wow! At a ski resort.

410
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:32,429
        Pork osso bucco.        

411
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,965
   WOMAN: It absolutely melts   
         in your mouth.         

412
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:35,433
    It's really,really good.    

413
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,702
        And it's a cozy,        
  wonderful atmosphere in here. 

414
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,105
   FIERI: Which fits right in   
         with the food.         

415
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,907
              MAN:              
 I like the mushroom stroganoff 

416
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:44,242
      if I'm really hungry      
     after a day of skiing.     

417
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:45,710
  Bunch of different mushrooms. 
         It's delicious.        

418
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:48,512
Okay, so, we're gonna be        
 making the spaetzel            

419
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:49,847
 for the vegetarian             
mushroom stroganoff.            

420
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:50,848
          Love me some spaetzel.

421
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,917
   We'll start off              
   with the flour.              

422
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,852
 We're gonna sift it            
       a bit.                   

423
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:57,321
Create a little hole there,     
  toss in the eggs,             

424
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,390
little warmed milk --           
   not boiling --               

425
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:02,126
a little bit of water,          
 and a little salt.             

426
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,528
I'm gonna start working it      
   with my hands.               

427
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,929
Doesn't take very long          
       at all.                  

428
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:06,531
You want a really nice,         
    sticky dough.               

429
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:08,265
I've got a spaetzel maker       
     over here.                 

430
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,401
              [ German accent ] 
       ♪ Roll out the spaetzel ♪

431
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:12,403
All right, dough's done.        

432
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,872
We're just gonna take it        
into this little scoopy thingy. 

433
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:18,676
Gravity will eventually         
     do its job.                

434
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:20,011
So, you just slide it           

435
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:21,412
into the boiling water          
   back and forth.              

436
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:25,483
The sliding action will actually
cut the dough as it goes in.    

437
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,884
A lot of people refer           
to spaetzel as pasta.           

438
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:29,553
    It's actually               
 more of a dumpling.            

439
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,456
Now, it needs to cook in here   
for just a couple minutes.      

440
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,294
 And we just put it             
   in an ice bath.              

441
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,398
And then we sauté it            
at the time of service.         
                         Got it.

442
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:45,169
  Fire up the pan.              
 Little bit of oil.             

443
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,704
Then I got ahead and dump in    
my sliced, domestic mushrooms.  

444
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,173
              So, the buttons?  
   Yep.                         

445
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,708
    The oysters.                

446
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,176
Here's the shiitakes.           
                          Okay. 

447
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,977
A little salt and pepper.       

448
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:55,312
     All right,                 
then I just stir it.            

449
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,248
This will get cooked down       
for about 25 minutes or so.     

450
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,649
So, now we're gonna assemble    
     the dishes.                

451
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:00,117
 So, we're gonna get            
a little oil in the pan,        

452
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,185
little bit of red onion.        

453
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,520
              Touch of garlic.  

454
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,321
     Mushrooms.                 

455
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,791
    Little toss.                

456
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,459
     Those cook                 
just a moment or two.           

457
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:11,796
One of the keys to this         
is the roasted-vegetable stock. 

458
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:13,464
Add a little bit of sour cream  
 right off the bat.             

459
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,266
Sort of swirl that in.          

460
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:18,736
That's where you kind of get    
that classic stroganoff flavor. 

461
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:22,106
Chives. Salt. Pepper.           

462
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,809
And now we're gonna go          
 for the reduction.             

463
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:26,611
We're gonna be plating          
    the spaetzel.               

464
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:28,646
Next is the mushrooms.          

465
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:31,682
Put just a touch more           
     sour cream,                

466
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:32,816
then a little bit of chive.     

467
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:33,951
    There you go.               

468
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:35,753
And that is the vegetarian      
mushroom stroganoff.            

469
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:37,555
           Boom, boom, mushroom.

470
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,924
                 Little mix.    

471
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:43,227
          I can't say it's good.

472
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,762
       [ Fork clatters ]        
       But I can say it's great,
                  though.       

473
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,298
          The type of mushrooms,

474
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,834
     the way you cook them down 
but leave them with integrity --

475
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,702
      I think that the mushrooms
       are still tender enough. 

476
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:52,937
           They brought out tons
                 of flavor.     

477
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,640
             I think that stock 
        plays a huge role in it.

478
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,575
                It's hearty.    
              It's comforting.  

479
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,643
                 Outrageous.    

480
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:00,912
             You're a gangster. 
  Thank you, sir.               

481
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,049
           Tastes like          
  you're in Germany somewhere,  

482
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,984
 and it's perfect when you come 
      right off the slopes.     

483
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:09,786
  I was gonna leave, but between
          the slopes, the snow, 

484
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:12,589
         and the dude that made 
the awesome mushroom stroganoff,

485
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,724
          I got to stick around.

486
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:15,726
        You got another dish?   
I have a crispy pork belly.     

487
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:17,195
             When we come back, 
                 hanging out    

488
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:19,129
         at the Silver Star Café
            in Park City, Utah. 

489
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,731
        Love me some pork belly.
 Me, too.                       

490
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,609
        Uh, welcome back.       

491
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,411
        It's the "Diners,       
     Drive-Ins, and Dives,"     

492
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:35,613
     not "Diners, Drive-Ins,    
        and ski slopes."        

493
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,748
         I'm hanging out        
    at the Silver Star Café,    

494
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,016
        and you have promised me

495
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:41,285
           if I would come back 
           and not go out there,

496
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,153
       you said we could have...
Crispy pork belly.              

497
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,822
                    Mmm!        
            All right, bring it.

498
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:47,024
First thing I'm gonna do        
is I'm gonna score the meat.    

499
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,495
The next thing I'm gonna do     
is smear molasses on it.        

500
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:52,697
            Black-tar Texas tea.

501
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:56,167
Next, I'm gonna season it.      

502
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:57,434
             And just one side? 
             Just the fat side? 

503
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,036
        Yeah.                   
Just salt and pepper.           

504
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:01,238
Real liberal on this one.       

505
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,372
Just throw it on the pan.       

506
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:03,908
 We're gonna toss it            
  in the pizza oven             

507
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,577
for about seven or eight        
      minutes.                  

508
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:07,912
                  Just put      
           a little roast on it?

509
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:09,446
            Little bit of crunch
                   on it,       

510
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:10,647
  and now we're gonna braise it.
Right.                          

511
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,718
   So, I start off              
with maple syrup in the pan.    

512
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,253
I'll just place this            
right on top of that syrup.     

513
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:17,988
                Now, you take   
    the cinnamon-amon-amon-amon.

514
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,056
Just throw it on top.           

515
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:21,259
         And your water, doctor.
 Yep.                           

516
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:25,529
    Three hours.                
  Plastic and foil.             

517
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:26,797
      Plastic really locks down,

518
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,532
    and you actually build steam
                  in this,      

519
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,467
            and if you poked it,
              it would pssssh!  

520
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:33,070
  A sheet of foil.              

521
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:35,740
 And then after this            
is all covered and sealed up,   

522
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:38,542
it'll go in the oven            
right around 560 degrees or so  

523
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:39,944
for about three hours.          

524
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:41,479
     After that,                
we actually let it cool         

525
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:42,647
 in its braising jus            
     overnight.                 

526
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:47,084
             Then we'll cut it. 

527
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:49,153
Then it'll get skewered.        

528
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:52,089
           And then what? Fried?
  Fried.                        

529
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:54,091
So, this is the crispy          
pork belly appetizer.           

530
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:55,760
So, you start off with          
your cooked beans and apple.    

531
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:57,561
                Look at that!   

532
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,029
   Okay, you think that's enough
                 pork belly?    

533
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,698
         You gave me half a pig.

534
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,033
And then the last thing         
that we're gonna do,            

535
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:03,100
it's my own interpretation      

536
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:04,701
 of a Carolina-style            
   barbecue sauce,              

537
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,637
 and then finish off            
with a touch of green.          

538
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:07,838
       That is                  
the crispy pork belly.

             just falling apart.

541
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:18,448
           You get that molasses
             right off the bat. 

542
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,385
         Carolina-style sauce...

543
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,387
              with that vinegar 
               is right there.  

544
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:26,591

         on meat you can't beat.

   Crispy pork belly and taco.  

547
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:33,597
   Have you ever seen a place   
   at the bottom of a ski run   

548

    that has food like this?    
                            No.
