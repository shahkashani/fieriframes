           IT'S YUMMY.          
        IT'S VERY UNIQUE.       

123
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:47,152
                  THIS IS CRAZY.
WE ARE GOING TO FINISH OFF      
 WITH THE CROWD-PLEASER,        

124
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:49,821
WHICH IS THE LAMB               
1/2-POUND BURGER.               

125
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,823
       REALLY GOOD BURGER,      
         REALLY TENDER.         

126
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:54,760
      HAD A LOAD OF TASTE.      
                   I CAN'T WAIT.

127
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:58,029
  WHAT WE'RE GONNA MAKE NOW IS  
 THE SAUCE FOR OUR LAMB BURGER. 

128
00:04:58,065 --> 00:05:00,098
               WE'RE GONNA START
                WITH OUR LIME.  

129
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,166
SEE, RIGHT NOW, WE COULD        
 BE MAKING A MARGARITA.         

130
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:04,168
        WE COULD GO             
THE WHOLE OTHER DIRECTION.      

131
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:06,170
             IT COULD BE.       
       THAT WOULD BE VERY NICE. 

132
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:08,173
 BUT THE VINEGAR--              
YOU JUST WRECKED IT.            
        VINEGAR--THAT WOULD RUIN
              OUR MARGARITA.    

133
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,175
AND THE GARLIC--YEAH.           
                 GARLIC, WELL...

134
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,245
WE'RE NOT GOIN' THERE.          
  NOW WHAT, OREGANO?            
           OREGANO, ONION, SALT.

135
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,247
       ARE THESE                
THE RED CHILIES AGAIN,          

136
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,382
OR ARE THESE GUAJILLOS?         
        NO, THESE ARE GUAJILLOS.

137
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:18,917
THESE ARE GUAJILLOS.            

138
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,919
NOW WE'RE NOT GONNA STEEP THESE 
     IN WATER OR ANYTHING?      
                             NO.

139
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:23,121
 WE'RE JUST GONNA               
GRIND 'EM RIGHT UP?             
      JUST GONNA DO IT DIRECTLY.

140
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:25,990
     WE'RE JUST GONNA GET THIS  
   TO THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF WATER,

141
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,794
          AND WE'RE GONNA BLEND 
         ALL OF OUR INGREDIENTS.

142
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,131
     SO YOU'RE JUST             
GONNA LIQUEFY THIS THING.       
         OH, YES, YES, YES, YES.

143
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,599
                 AND THAT'S IT. 

144
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:37,068
    WE'RE GONNA INCORPORATE THIS
        INTO OUR GROUND LAMB.   

145
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:39,070
WOW, IT SMELLS GOOD.            
              AND TASTES BETTER.

146
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:42,607
           WE'RE GONNA ADD A LOT
                OF OREGANO.     
LOOK AT THAT.                   

147
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:44,609
NOW WHAT DOES THIS DISH         
      COME FROM?                

148
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:46,745
              THIS DISH COMES   
           FROM A TACO IN MéJICO

149
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,147
                  THAT IS CALLED
                   TACO PASTOR. 
AL PASTOR?                      

150
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,550
                            YES.
OH, I LOVE AL PASTOR.           

151
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,552
BUT AL PASTOR I SEE,            

152
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,554
      SOMETIMES PEOPLE          
ARE PUTTING PINEAPPLE IN IT.    

153
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,756
      THAT'S THE WAY THAT WE DO 
     THE REST OF OUR HAMBURGER. 

154
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:59,957
PUT THE PINEAPPLE               
ON THE FLAT GRILL               

155
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:01,959
JUST TO SEAR IT                 
 A LITTLE BIT.                  

156
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:04,295
   WE'RE GONNA PUT              
A LITTLE BIT OF SALT.           

157
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:06,764
THIS IS ABOUT                   
READY TO GO.                    
                      I LIKE IT.

158
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:08,633
     LET'S GET                  
THE CILANTRO GOING.             

159
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:10,902
              IT'S A BIG BURGER.
IT'S VERY BIG.                  
 CLOSE IT UP.                   

160
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:12,971
                   SO NO MAYO,  
                  NO SOUR CREAM?
NO MAYO, NO NOTHING.            

161
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,506
                  LOOK AT THAT. 

162
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:16,508
         NOT EXACTLY THE BURGER 
           I EXPECTED TO FIND   

163
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:18,510
     WHEN I DROVE UP TO A PLACE 
       THAT'S BEEN 54 YEARS--   

164
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:21,145
                  A LAMB BURGER 
                 WITH AL PASTOR 

165
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:24,850
      AND SOME GRILLED PINEAPPLE
          AND SOME CILANTRO.    
GO FOR IT.                      

166
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:26,852
                   THAT'S GOOD. 

167
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,987
                NOT TOO SPICY,  
               GOOD LAMB FLAVOR,

168
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,989
       AND THE PINEAPPLE--      
 THE SWEETNESS--BALANCES IT OUT.

169
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,391
      A LOT DIFFERENT THAN      
 A HAMBURGER, A LOT MORE JUICY. 

170
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,926
IT'S JUST THE FLAVOR.           

171
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:37,395
  THE FOOD IS JUST EXCELLENT.   
                       CLOSE BY.

172
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:39,397
          GOOD PRICES.          
 MAY I HELP YOU?                
HOW ARE YOU DOING?              

173
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,333
       THEY SEE ME COMING.      
     THEY KNOW WHAT I WANT.     

174
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:43,335
 THE BEST THING HERE            
ON THE MENU IS WHAT?            
  THE GREEN CHILE CHEESEBURGERS.

175
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,403
  SO THIS IS WHAT               
YOU HAVE EVERY TIME.            
              YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.

176
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:47,405
THE GUY KNOWS                   
WHAT HE LIKES.                  

177
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:49,474
  IF SOMEBODY COMES TO SANTA FE 
   AND DOESN'T MAKE THEIR STOP  

178
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,543
  AT BERT'S BURGER BOWL,        
THEY ARE MISSING SOMETHING.     

179
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:53,545
              IT'S KIND OF LIKE 
            GOING TO LOS ANGELES

180
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:55,547
     BUT NOT HITTIN' DISNEYLAND.

               THANK YOU.       
              OH.

I LIKE THE SPLITTING            
OF THE GRILLED DOG.             

293

 AS A LOT OF TIMES IT CAN BE.   

295
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:06,364
DO PEOPLE IN NEW YORK           
  KNOW ABOUT THIS?              

296
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,299
    THE NEW YORKER IS SAVORY.   
        I REALLY LIKE IT.       

297

        IT'S DELICIOUS.         
I LOVE THE SAUERKRAUT.          

298
00:11:10,604 --> 00:11:12,303
         THE SAUERKRAUT         
       TASTES VERY FRESH.       

299
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:14,305
       IT'S DIFFERENT HERE      
       THAN OTHER PLACES.       

300
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:16,307
    YOU FORTIFY IT WITH YOUR OWN

 THE MOST WIDELY USED CONDIMENTS

321
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,482

          WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.     

408
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:19,350
YOU COULD MAKE 'EM AHEAD OF TIME
       IN JUST WAX PAPER.       
COULD. DON'T.                   

409
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:22,353
I WANT THEIR TACOS TASTING

410
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,088
                  SO THAT'S IT. 

411
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,690
            NOW WE CAN STUFF IT 
          WITH WHATEVER WE WANT.
STEAK, CHICKEN, BEEF.           

412
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:28,692
               NOW THIS IS WHAT 
                WE'RE GONNA USE 

413
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:30,694
                     TO MAKE    
                THE CARNE ASADA?
STEAK. EXACTLY.                 

414
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,696
TAKE IT OVER TO THE SLICER.     
 PUT THE SPICES TOGETHER--      

415
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:34,832
A LITTLE BLACK PEPPER, SEA SALT,
   ONION SALT, CAYENNE PEPPER   

416
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:38,036
AND OREGANO.                    
              OH, I LIKE        
      THE SEASONING MIX ON THAT.

417
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:40,237
           AND THEN WE GRILL IT?
OPEN FLAME.                     

418
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:42,507
MEDIUM-RARE ON BOTH SIDES       
 SO IT DOESN'T DRY OUT?         
                     YOU GOT IT.

419
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:44,442
             AND AFTER IT COOLS,
              THEN WE SLICE IT. 

420
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:46,377
                 IF YOU SLICE IT
                   RIGHT AWAY-- 
   YOU LOSE

                  THAT'S SOME   
              PRETTY GOOD CARNE.

422
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,315
                THESE GET POPPED
                 INSIDE OF HERE?
RIGHT.                          

423
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,849
               THAT'S A HEALTHY 
                LITTLE PORTION. 

424
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:53,851

             BYE-BYE, LET'S FRY?
LET'S DO IT.                    

425
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,853
 AFTER IT'S DONE COOKING, LET IT
 DRAIN A LITTLE BIT OF THE OIL. 

426
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:57,388
    SHOULD WE SEE               
WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE?            

427
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:59,523

A LITTLE SOMETHING.             
                   LOOK AT THAT.

APPRECIATE THAT.

  IT'S GOT A GREAT TASTE TO IT. 

436
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,011
       IT TASTED HOMEMADE.      

437
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,480
   MY MOM DIDN'T                
MAKE 'EM THIS GOOD.             
      THAT'S KIND OF LIKE       
     THE SEAL OF APPROVAL.      

438
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:25,283
      WE OUGHT TO MAKE THAT

      AND IT'S GREAT FOOD.      

440
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,487
     IT TASTES REALLY FRESH.    

441
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,889
               I WANT EVERYTHING
                COOKED THAT DAY.
       THE SALSA'S GREAT.

                    THAT'S GOOD.
                   THAT'S MONEY.
THAT'S MONEY.                   

446
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:43,901
              ALL THE WAY DOWN.

CHICKEN CHIMI.                  

451
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,780
WELL, LET'S MAKE A CHIMICHANGA, 
   A BIG DEEP-FRIED BURRITO.    
                        EXACTLY.

452
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:58,716
IT'S 80/20 GROUND BEEF.         
  ADD THE SEASONINGS RIGHT AFTER
     WE GET THE MEAT IN THERE.  

453
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:00,985
ANCHO...                        
           ANCHO CHILI PEPPER...

455
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,324
             ADD A LITTLE WATER.
EVERYBODY'S IN THE POOL.        

456
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:08,425
YOU'RE GONNA LET IT SIT HERE    
AND COOK FOR WHAT, TWO HOURS?   
              ABOUT RIGHT AT IT.

457
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:11,328
     SO THAT'S COOKED DOWN.     
I MEAN, THAT IS LIKE BEEF SAUCE.

458
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,664
         (whistles)             
AND THIS IS THE METHOD, HUH?    

459
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,933
       THE SPICES HELP SEPARATE 
        THAT OIL FROM THE MEAT. 

460
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:18,870
    THAT'S PRECISE.             
SO LET THESE COOL DOWN.         

461
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:20,872
            THEN WHAT GOES DOWN?
PINTO BEANS.

463

   IS THAT WHEN YOU WERE HANGIN'

464
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,944

         PARTICULAR INFORMATION.

466
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:30,948
   SOMETHING LIKE SORTING BEANS,
      WHICH IS QUITE AN ART,    

467
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:32,950
          VERY SELDOM DONE,     
    AND THEN YOU COOK THE BEANS.

468
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:35,153
               MIX THE BEANS    
           INTO THE GROUND BEEF.
JUST A FEW.                     

469
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:37,155

            SO IT'S PLIABLE.    

470
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:39,156
EXACTLY. MAKE IT PLIABLE,       
  SO WE CAN FOLD IT UP.         
            SO IT DOESN'T CRACK.

471

     A LITTLE REFRIED BEANS,    
 A GOOD AMOUNT OF MEAT, ONIONS.

00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,760

WATER, JUST ENOUGH

       SIMMER IT                
FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF.

00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,764
LET IT BREAK DOWN.              
    (whistles)                  

503
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,699
IT ALMOST STARTS                
TO SHRED FOR YOU.

  FOR YOU FOR A DAY?            
                     HALF A DAY.

505
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,703
 REALLY? AND THEN               
YOU'LL DO IT AGAIN?             
                           YEAH.

 SO THE CHICKEN                 
GETS SHREDDED UP.               
          WE JUST WANT TO ADD   
        A LITTLE PUNGENT FLAVOR.

508
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:06,644
THIS MIXTURE OF CUMIN,          
 CAYENNE AND PAPRIKA.           
         AND YOU ROLL IT AROUND.

509
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:10,181
 THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT. 
         THAT'S KILLER.         

510
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,316
THAT'S A REALLY NICE FLAVOR.    

511
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:14,318
              WE NEED THE SAUCE 
             FOR THE ENCHILADAS.

512
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:16,320
                  START WITH    
               THE TOMATO SAUCE.

513
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:19,122
               WE'VE GOT SOME   
            CHILI POWDER--ANCHO.
WELL, THE ANCHO CHILI FARMERS

       ONION SALT, THE SEA SALT,
           A LITTLE GARLIC,

00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:27,464
                 A LITTLE<i> AGUA.</i> 
YOU LET THAT WARM UP.           

518
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:29,800
THIS IS ONE THING ABOUT MEXICAN 
 FOOD THAT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW,   

519
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,270
IS A LOT OF IT IS PREPARATION-- 
   THE "LOW AND SLOW" IDEA.     

520
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:33,738
           LET THAT WARM UP.    
       YOU TAKE SOME CANOLA OIL.

521
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,407
SAUCE IS HOT--                  
DIP, FRY, OUT.                  

522
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:38,208
                  PUT IT IN     
            THE ENCHILADA SAUCE.

523
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:40,210
          HEAT THE TORTILLA     
     WITH THAT SALSA IN THE OIL.

524
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:42,413
  IT REALLY MAKES THAT ENCHILADA
     SAUCE SO FRIED INTO IT...  
IT JUST SOAKS                   
RIGHT INTO IT.                  

525
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:45,282
    SOAK RIGHT INTO IT, AND THAT
      TORTILLA HOLDS THE SAUCE. 
DIP, FRY, OUT.                  

526
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,818
   I LIKE THE CONCEPT.          
COOK THAT RIGHT INTO IT.        

527
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,821
          YOU LOOK LIKE         
 EDWARD SCISSORHANDS WITH THOSE.

528
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,023

LOOK AT THAT CHICKEN.           

529
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:55,025
         A LITTLE BIT OF CHEESE 
              INSIDE ALSO.      

530
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:57,494
 THEN IT HAS TO GO              
THROUGH THE STEAMER.            
         (steam hisses)         

531
00:19:57,564 --> 00:19:59,496
I THINK WE'RE READY.            
                           NICE.

532
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,832
      ROLL IT UP HERE.          
TOP IT WITH SOME MORE CHEESE.   
                           OKAY.

00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:03,367
                  LOOK AT THAT. 

534
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:05,369

THERE YOU GO.                   

541
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:23,588

   TO A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT.   
CALIFORNIA TACOS.               

542
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,323
