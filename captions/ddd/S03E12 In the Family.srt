COME AND WORK HERE?             
    THEY RUN EVERYTHING NOW.    

186
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:10,221
         <i> BUT ASK THEM</i>          
       <i> WHO'S IN CHARGE.</i>        
         (both) MY MOM.         

187
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,556
                            MOM.
YEAH, DEFINITELY.               

188
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:13,424
         YOU NEED TO GO         
           TO A TABLE.          

189
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,827
  YOU NEED TO GO TO THE KITCHEN 
  AND YOU BACK TO THE KITCHEN.  

190
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,829
                  WHO TAUGHT HIM
                   HOW TO COOK? 
ME.                             

191
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:20,665
           AND THE REASON THAT  
         I KNOW IT'S AUTHENTIC--

192
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,301
         IT'S 'CAUSE SHE'S HERE.
(speaking Spanish)<i> CALIENTE!</i>    

193
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,170
WHAT ARE YOU HAVING?            
                        MOFONGO.

194
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:28,506
          THE MOFONGO           
      WITH FRIED CHICKEN.       
                  YOU HAVE      
           MOFONGO PORK, SHRIMP.

195
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:30,775
  THE SIDE ORDERS ARE           
WHAT WE PUT IN THE TOP,         

196
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:33,845
   BUT THE MOFONGO'S            
ALWAYS THE SAME BASICS.         
               SO WHAT DO WE DO?

197
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,713
    CUT UP THE PLANTAIN         
AND WE PUT IT IN THE FRYER.     

198
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:37,849
WE DO THE COMBINATION           
  OF SALT, GARLIC.              

199
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,784
MIX OUT HERE FIRST,             
  WE GRIND IT UP,               

200
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,187
   AND THEN WE PUT              
THE PLANTAIN INSIDE.            

201
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,988
WE GONNA DO--                   
               WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
              WHAT IS THIS BOWL?

202
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,725
          WHERE DO YOU BUY THIS?
THIS ONE IS CUSTOM-MADE         
    IN PUERTO RICO.             

203
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:49,861
    AND WITH SOMETHING          
LIKE THIS THEY MASH IT UP.      

204
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,596
            LOOK AT THAT THING. 

205
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:54,865
   HE'S GOT A BIG GIANT OAK LOG 
       WITH A BASEBALL BAT.     

206
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:58,269
 SO WE PUT                      
THIS ONE IN...                  
     GARLIC, SALT, CHICHARRóNES.

207
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,871
AND THEN WE HIT IT.             

208
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,807
WE'RE GONNA BE JUMPING          
     A LITTLE BIT.              

209
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,809
              THIS IS MORTAR    
           AND PESTLE GONE WILD.

210
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:07,678
                HOW DO YOU      
           GET IT OUT OF THERE? 

211
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:10,548
      I HAVE A BIG              
LONG SPOON TO GET IT OUT,       

212
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,684
    AND THEN WE                 
PUT IT HERE AGAIN.              

213
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:14,753
 THE PLANTAIN IS READY          
AND THEN OUR SEASONING.         

214
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:17,555
 THEN WE'RE GONNA               
PUT THE OLIVE OIL,              

215
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:19,757
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO HIT        
  IT IN A SPECIFIC WAY          

216
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,093
SO THE PLANTAINS GO...          
                  SO YOU MOVE IT
                   UP AND DOWN. 

217
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:25,630
EXACTLY. YOU WANT               
     TO TRY?                    
   WELL, JUST GET ANGRY WITH IT.
     YEAH, I'LL GET IN ON THIS. 

218
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:28,366
YOU GOT THE IDEA.               
YOU GOT THE IDEA.               

219
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:30,035
     LET ME                     
GIVE YOU A HAND.                

220
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:33,905
 I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD BE JOGGING
     IN PLACE OR SOMETHING.     

221
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,441
     AND EVERY TIME THAT SOMEONE
      ORDERS THIS, YOU DO THIS? 

222
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:39,043
EXACTLY. THIS IS                
WHEN IT'S DONE.                 

223
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:41,779
   NOW WE'RE GONNA DO           
THE MEAT FOR THE MOFONGO.       

224
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:45,583
          WE'RE JUST GONNA LEAVE
              THIS BAT-BEATEN   

225
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:48,453
     FRIED PLANTAIN, CHICHARRóN 
        GARLIC MESS IN HERE?    

226
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,455
YES.                            
                           GOOD.

227
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:52,924
          SO THIS IS THE PORK.  
         HOW LONG WILL THIS FRY?

228
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:56,527
  ONLY FIVE MINUTE OR LESS,     
BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY COOKED.    

229
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,663
     THEN WE PUT                
THE MOFONGO IN HERE,            

230
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:01,533
   AND THEN WE PUT              
THE MEAT AT THE TOP.            

231
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:03,935
    WE EAT IT WITH              
SOME CHICKEN CONSOMMé.          

232
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:07,606
              SO THE MEAT IS    
           MORE SOFT AND TENDER.

233
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:10,608
WOW. THIS IS AWESOME.           

234
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,612
  BUT YOU GET                   
THE LITTLE BITE.                
                OH, THE CRUNCHY.

          ONE AROUND.           

237
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,354
     WHAT I LOVE THE MOST IS    
  THE SEASONING AND THE GARLIC.

00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:25,023
    <i> AND IT'S NOT JUST PORK.</i>

SO IMPRESSED.                   

250
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:02,527
THAT MIGHT BE SERIOUSLY         
ONE OF THE BEST THINGS          

251
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,628
I'VE EVER TRIED                 
 ON TRIPLE D.

00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,731
HE'S A WIZARD!                  
         JUST AMAZING.          

253
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,867
    YOU CAN SMELL THE GARLIC    
     WHEN YOU GET THE DISH.     
            A LITTLE SALTY, TOO,

254
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:12,136

             YOU TAKE THESE

THAT'S HOW IT WOULD TASTE?      

261
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:30,622
                    THAT'S HOW
