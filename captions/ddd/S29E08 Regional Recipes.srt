1
00:00:01,435 --> 00:00:02,768
   Hey, there. I'm Guy Fieri,

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,436
      and we're rolling out
           looking for

3
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:06,705
   America's greatest diners,
      drive-ins, and dives.

4
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:08,640
          This trip...
                      Bring it.

5
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:11,777
    ...we're divin' into some
   righteous regional recipes.

6
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:14,580
I can't get this in my face
    fast enough.

7
00:00:14,582 --> 00:00:16,949
      Like red-hot Mexican
         in California.

8
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:19,418
This is how it comes out
to your table, this inferno.

9
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,787
       Smoking sandwiches
         in San Antonio.

10
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:23,088
             Really impressive.
             Thank you, brother.

11
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,823
    Plus crazy good Creole...

12
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,158
Oh, you do that right.

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,461
       ...served up by one
    outstanding octogenarian.

14
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:32,498
              Imitated by many,
             duplicated by none.

15
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,832
   The real deal.

16
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,868
     That's all right here,
           right now,

17
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,370
 on "Diners, Drive-ins & Dives."

18
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,917
   So I'm here in Santa Rosa,
           California,

19
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:54,153
 just a few miles from my house
        to check out a...

20
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:57,389
Santa Rosa, California.

21
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,657
Now, my buddy, Chef Cesar,

22
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:00,392
  who works for us
at Knuckle Sandwich,

23
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:03,395
has been telling me about
this amazing Mexican restaurant.

24
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:07,633
I really appreciate it.

25
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:10,002
The translation part, though,
I needed help on the inside.

26
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:11,503
    I got this part out here.
             -Okay.

27
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:13,138
      He's been telling me
         it's authentic,

28
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,707
  and they're cooking food in a
way that we haven't seen before.

29
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:17,509
This is it, Taqueria Molcajetes.

30
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:20,512
- Oh, good Spanish.

31
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:22,214
                 Three tacos
              and steak ready.

32
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:25,217
 -Everything tastes so homemade.
            -Mixtos.

33
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:26,819
It reminds me of Mexico.

34
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:30,022
The food is just exactly the way
  it is down there.

35
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:34,326
  Specifically, Guadalajara and
 Michoacán, the Mexican regions

36
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:38,630
  where owners Zacarías Martín
     and Dionisia Valdovino

37
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:41,133
        are getting their
      culinary inspiration.

38
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:43,702
   Ask them what makes Michoacán
             food so different.

39
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:45,471
     And remember, there's a lot
                  of people

40
00:01:45,473 --> 00:01:47,239
                watching that
             understand Spanish,

41
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:49,274
           so don't say anything
              about the fat guy

42
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,210
          with the bleached hair
               wants to know.

43
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:02,354
     And onion.

44
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:04,857
  And don't forget the joint's
    namesake, the molcajetes,

45
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:08,193
    which is the traditional
   Mexican mortar and pestle,

46
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:10,996
    which they're loading up
         scorching hot.

47
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:12,297
  Molcajete mixto.

48
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:15,968
    Chorizo, cheese, chicken.
      It's good, very nice.

49
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,469
 All right, so this
  is the spice mix,

50
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,271
 or what do you call
the sauce inside of it?

51
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:21,807
              Salsa molcajete.

52
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,408
          Orange juice.
            -Oregano.

53
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,810
           -Bay leaf.
            -Cloves.

54
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,578
            Pimiento.
          Black pepper.

55
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,779
             -Cumin.
             -Salt.

56
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:30,015
So the original way that this
would have been done

57
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:31,617
   would have been
  in a molcajetes.

58
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:33,986
        Now we're making
     a tomatillo tomato mix.

59
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:36,021
            -Got it.
   -Combine onions and garlic.

60
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:39,057
             -Water.
 -How long is this going to go?

61
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:41,860
           15 minutes,
      and now the chilies.

62
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:44,429
      -A little bit of oil.
          -And garlic.

63
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,637
  So everything is
15 minutes around here.

64
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:55,607
So we have the vinegar-herb
mixture that we made.

65
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:56,909
We have the tomatoes,
     the onions,

66
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:58,177
the garlic, the chilies,

67
00:02:58,179 --> 00:02:59,745
 and now everything
   comes together.

68
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:01,413
 And this is all for
 the salsa molcajete

69
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:03,815
that's going to go inside
one of these cauldrons of heat

70
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,517
  that are cooking
    in the back.

71
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:10,422
You can taste a little bit
of that vinegar in the back,

72
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:13,358
a little bit of the heat of the
chili, but it's really smooth.

73
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,093
   Now we're gonna
  put it together.

74
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:16,628
            Chorizo.
       They make it here.

75
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,764
You make the chorizo
and put it in the casing here?

76
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:20,666
                          Yep.
I'm going to tell you
  something, Cesar.

77
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:22,167
 When they're making
 their own chorizo,

78
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:23,702
  they're blending
  their own spices,

79
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,070
   I think that's
   the difference.

80
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,375
        Beef and chicken.

81
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,644
             Butter.
    -Always that many shrimp?

82
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,246
- Eight.

83
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:36,014
        Salt and garlic.

84
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:37,950
You know what, Cesar?
   I am so sorry.

85
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:39,751
  I didn't have him
    make you one.

86
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:41,486
     It's okay.
Just watch me eat it.

87
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:45,624
   it's already cooking again.
             -Salsa.

88
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:47,960
This is how it comes out
to your table, this inferno.

89
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:51,196
       Chorizo and cheese.

90
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:52,631
      You make
 the tortillas also?

91
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:53,665
          All handmade.

92
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,334
And it comes with rice
   and beans also?

93
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:57,002
                    Yeah.

94
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:03,175
  Without question,
   one of the best

95
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:05,677
Mexican food experiences
   I've ever had.

96
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:08,313
I can't get this in my face
    fast enough.

97
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:10,082
  All the aromas that comes out
          when you put

98
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:11,817
      a hot sauce into a --
   -That's exactly what it is.

99
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,185
 It brings all the flavors out.

100
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:15,420
     Outrageous.
This exceeded my expectations.

101
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,289
One more bite, Cesar,
and then you're done.

102
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:20,592
Really?
  Really?

103
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,094
  Molcajete mixto.

104
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:25,163
       You get a taste of
    every single ingredient.

105
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:29,768
 And when it's combined in this
delicious sauce, it's explosive.

106
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,937
          It's amazing.
  -Three tacos and steak ready.

107
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,605
From the moment I walked in,

108
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,340
      I knew this was going
      to be the real deal.

109
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:38,410
   The energy, the enthusiasm,
  the Mexican culture and food.

110
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:39,978
   It is what's going on here.

111
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,347
 Which means traditional tacos.

112
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:43,749
      Your al pastor tacos.

113
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:46,685
  The tacos pastor is delicious.
      I'm getting the real deal.

114
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:48,954
What are we doing now?

115
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:52,257
We're going to start with the
 adobo, the sauce for the pork.

116
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,626
           Oil. Onion.

117
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,596
      Chilies. California.
            Guajillo.

118
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:58,730
    The bay leaf.

119
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:00,432
           -Chocolate.
   -This is Mexican chocolate.

120
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:03,035
It's got little cinnamon,
little chunks of sugar.

121
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:04,102
          Black pepper.

122
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:06,405
            -Cloves.
            -Oregano.

123
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:07,839
         -Orange juice.
         -Orange juice.

124
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:10,142
       Salt, red coloring,
         white vinegar.

125
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:12,227
   Cook this down,
      puree it.

126
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,362
     e  y

127
00:05:13,364 --> 00:05:14,997
 So how long is this
going to marinate, chef?

128
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:16,031
       At least 12 hours.

129
00:05:16,033 --> 00:05:17,632
And then we put it
on the rotisserie.

130
00:05:17,634 --> 00:05:19,634
A pineapple on the bottom,
and a pineapple on the top.

131
00:05:19,636 --> 00:05:21,737
So this is how it is,
old school, down in Mexico?

132
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:23,271
     Somebody's making tacos
          all day long,

133
00:05:23,273 --> 00:05:24,973
        so he's chopping
        and spinning it.

134
00:05:24,975 --> 00:05:26,575
          Onion. Salsa.

135
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:28,744
         -And that's it?
           -That's it.

136
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,982
This is as close to the Mexican
street taco experience

137
00:05:33,984 --> 00:05:35,851
 that I've ever had
in the United States.

138
00:05:35,853 --> 00:05:37,686
    It's tender,
 not over-seasoned.

139
00:05:37,688 --> 00:05:40,389
You love the freshness
of the cilantro and the onion.

140
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:42,791
           -Want more?
   -Of course, I want 85 more.

141
00:05:42,793 --> 00:05:45,794
        Al pastor tacos.

142
00:05:45,796 --> 00:05:48,330
   I can have tacos al pastor
           every day.

143
00:05:48,332 --> 00:05:49,798
     The seasoning is great.

144
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,600
     The meat is delicious.

145
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,902
        So, if I gave you a taco
              from Mexico City

146
00:05:53,904 --> 00:05:55,537
                and one from
            Taqueria Molcajetes.

147
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:58,407
 I would probably think they're
     both from Mexico City.

148
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:01,943
- Dos ensaladas.

149
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,445
              So it's natural,
                it's unique,

150
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:04,780
        and the sauce --
             -Fresh.

151
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:07,816
                 It's fresh.
                Not bad, huh?

152
00:06:07,818 --> 00:06:08,850
                Carne asada.

153
00:06:08,852 --> 00:06:10,185
I really, really enjoy this.

154
00:06:10,187 --> 00:06:12,521
 It's almost like comfort food,
          if you wish.

155
00:06:12,523 --> 00:06:14,189
   I like to come very often.

156
00:06:14,191 --> 00:06:16,992
The foods you're making, the
experience people are getting.

157
00:06:16,994 --> 00:06:18,493
 It's the real deal.
    Outstanding.

158
00:06:18,495 --> 00:06:21,063
           -Thank you.
           -Thank you.

159
00:06:21,065 --> 00:06:23,999
 Up next, a taste of New Orleans
         in San Antonio.

160
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:27,803
That is every bit of what
you want a gumbo to taste like.

161
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:29,271
  Where I get right into it...

162
00:06:29,273 --> 00:06:31,773
A little more work than
I anticipated doing today.

163
00:06:31,775 --> 00:06:34,109
- A man of knowledge.

164
00:06:34,111 --> 00:06:36,078
    ...with an unforgettable
           character.

165
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,313
       -The food is great.
    -But the love is greater.

166
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,853
  Don't speak to me
     in Spanish.

167
00:06:44,855 --> 00:06:46,455
 I'm already having
  enough difficulty

168
00:06:46,457 --> 00:06:47,756
keeping up with English.

169
00:06:50,761 --> 00:06:52,294
   So I'm here in San Antonio,
             Texas,

170
00:06:52,296 --> 00:06:53,628
     on the east side about
   five minutes from downtown.

171
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,398
usn.
   So I'm here in San Antonio,
             Texas,

172
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,767
        Now, after 9/11,
     they closed the gates,

173
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:01,503
   and a lot of the businesses
  in this area, they took off.

174
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:03,171
      But if you're looking
        for a restaurant

175
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:06,341
    where the chef is living,
      loving, and laughing,

176
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:09,344
    and cooking, and rhyming,
   and teaching, and winning,

177
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,047
      all at the age of 89,
    then this is your place.

178
00:07:12,049 --> 00:07:14,382
       This is Ma Harper's
         Creole Kitchen.

179
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,220
         Cajun sausage.

180
00:07:18,222 --> 00:07:20,822
 I tried everything on the menu,
     and it's all delicious.

181
00:07:20,824 --> 00:07:23,725
        Po' boy right off
       of Bourbon Street.

182
00:07:23,727 --> 00:07:26,228
  The atmosphere and the people
      make it even better.

183
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:29,131
Which all begins with
 the illustrious Ma Harper,

184
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:30,532
          who got into
       the restaurant biz

185
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:32,501
         after retiring
     from her first career.

186
00:07:32,503 --> 00:07:34,002
    You worked at
 the Air Force base?

187
00:07:34,004 --> 00:07:36,705
              Yes, I worked on
           an F-15/F-16 Unified.

188
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:40,308
       I worked on the 107, 108,
              106, fuel pumps,

189
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,378
        I've worked on the wing,
 and I've worked in electronics.

190
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,846
      Get out.
Well, you don't have to get out.

191
00:07:44,848 --> 00:07:45,981
  It's your house.
    You can stay.

192
00:07:45,983 --> 00:07:47,415
           I'll leave.
  -Guess what -- If I get out,

193
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:48,550
                I'm going to
              take you with me.

194
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:49,918
     I like it.

195
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,654
These days, she's putting to use
    what she learned cooking

196
00:07:52,656 --> 00:07:55,657
         for 15 siblings
   growing up in New Orleans.

197
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:57,659
  I especially like the gumbo.

198
00:07:57,661 --> 00:08:00,128
When we go to New Orleans,
and we try all the gumbo,

199
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,264
 they don't compare
    to Ma Harper.

200
00:08:02,266 --> 00:08:04,032
     So, we got
the whole enchilada.

201
00:08:04,034 --> 00:08:06,001
     -Without the tortilla.
         -Let's hit it.

202
00:08:06,003 --> 00:08:07,569
      Water and the crabs.

203
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:08,904
       Not the shrimp yet.

204
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:10,805
  'Cause the shrimp
   will overcook.

205
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:13,575
  Thank you. Let somebody know,
      that's how you cook.

206
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:15,143
Chicken. Don't do that.

207
00:08:15,145 --> 00:08:16,444
            -Oh! Why?
       -Let me teach you.

208
00:08:16,446 --> 00:08:17,712
    Okay, come on, teach me.

209
00:08:17,714 --> 00:08:19,214
    ...for pots.

210
00:08:19,216 --> 00:08:21,082
You want to lose your job,
    beat my pot.

211
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,584
            Do that?
   Oh, look what you just did.

212
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:23,752
That's what I'm saying.

213
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:25,887
Metal, when it's hot,
    tears it up.

214
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:29,624
Spank that baby and say,
     "Be good."

215
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:32,227
       Onion,
add the bell peppers.

216
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:33,161
            I gotcha.

217
00:08:33,163 --> 00:08:35,897
      Sausage.
Dehydrated bell pepper.

218
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:36,932
              Okay.

219
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:40,068
 Dehydrated shrimp,
   parsley, thyme.

220
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,369
          Time to what?

221
00:08:41,371 --> 00:08:43,538
If you got time to lean,
you got time to clean.

222
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:46,041
Garlic powder.

223
00:08:46,043 --> 00:08:47,576
    My spice mix.

224
00:08:47,578 --> 00:08:49,244
      The ham.
    Black pepper.

225
00:08:49,246 --> 00:08:50,879
              Okay.
         Chicken broth?

226
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:52,214
             -Yeah.
         -Now the roux.

227
00:08:52,216 --> 00:08:53,548
  Cajun seasoning.

228
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,084
 Our gumbo files --
We call it filé, but it's --

229
00:08:56,086 --> 00:08:58,186
         Filé -- file --
      Bring this to a boil.

230
00:08:58,188 --> 00:08:59,621
     We'll drop the shrimp?
             -Yeah.

231
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:01,189
      What are we going to
      serve this with, Ma?

232
00:09:01,191 --> 00:09:03,458
     -Ma Harper's cornbread.
-You're going to do a cornbread.

233
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,896
         Cornmeal, flour, sugar,
        baking powder, and salt.

234
00:09:07,898 --> 00:09:09,598
             Never crack an egg
               over your food.

235
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,032
 I agree with that.

236
00:09:11,034 --> 00:09:12,968
           'Cause you don't know
       what hen's sitting in it.

237
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:15,937
                 Oil, milk.

238
00:09:15,939 --> 00:09:17,339
                Go egg again.

239
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:19,140
              Oil.
      -Gotta be fast today.

240
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,343
                    Milk.
             Another egg. Milk.

241
00:09:21,345 --> 00:09:24,212
A little more work than
I anticipated doing today.

242
00:09:24,214 --> 00:09:25,547
    No dry spots.

243
00:09:25,549 --> 00:09:27,649
             That's what I call
             a man of knowledge.

244
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:30,252
It's called a guy
that didn't have a mixer

245
00:09:30,254 --> 00:09:31,586
  for a long time.

246
00:09:31,588 --> 00:09:32,754
                  Pour it.

247
00:09:33,857 --> 00:09:35,357
I like that karate move.

248
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:37,959
I don't know how you made
that spoon jump right in there.

249
00:09:37,961 --> 00:09:39,494
  What temperature
 we putting that in?

250
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,029
              400 for an hour.

251
00:09:41,031 --> 00:09:42,664
        -Toothpick test?
         -Not necessary.

252
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:43,965
               I use eyesight.

253
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:45,533
   That's the way
 we're gonna do it.

254
00:09:45,535 --> 00:09:47,669
   -A little honey and butter?
    -Try it, you'll like it.

255
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:51,539
              Imitated by many,
             duplicated by none.

256
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,807
  Oh, that's good.

257
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:55,410
           So now we're gonna do
              some gumbo, rice.

258
00:09:55,412 --> 00:09:57,946
              Finishing it with
              Cajun seasoning.

259
00:09:57,948 --> 00:09:59,648
    That's good.

260
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,249
                 Talk to me.

261
00:10:01,251 --> 00:10:03,151
 Don't even act like
I need to talk to you

262
00:10:03,153 --> 00:10:04,886
  because you know
  how good this is.

263
00:10:04,888 --> 00:10:09,324
That is every bit of what
you want a gumbo to taste like.

264
00:10:09,326 --> 00:10:11,926
All that big grits flavor
coming out of that seafood.

265
00:10:11,928 --> 00:10:13,595
     It's silky.
    It's tender.

266
00:10:13,597 --> 00:10:15,063
  I can't eat this
    fast enough.

267
00:10:15,065 --> 00:10:17,065
                 Thank you.

268
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:18,566
             Here's your gumbo.

269
00:10:18,568 --> 00:10:21,436
       I like the flavor.
  All her special ingredients.

270
00:10:21,438 --> 00:10:23,371
    The seasoning, the gravy.

271
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,741
               Oh, cornbread.
  It has that just sweet flavor.

272
00:10:26,743 --> 00:10:29,344
         Wonderful to crumble up
                in my gumbo.

273
00:10:29,346 --> 00:10:31,846
      She feeds
the body and the soul.

274
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:33,948
She gives people second chances.

275
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,351
  When it's hard for them to go
    get a job somewhere else.

276
00:10:36,353 --> 00:10:38,787
         She trains 'em,
     and a lot of 'em go off

277
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:40,522
 and get their culinary degree.

278
00:10:40,524 --> 00:10:42,691
          I do hearing impaired.

279
00:10:42,693 --> 00:10:46,127
      I do anybody that has made
                 a mistake,

280
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:47,962
                and they feel
              there's no more.

281
00:10:47,964 --> 00:10:51,533
I was taught, if you don't work,
               you don't eat.

282
00:10:51,535 --> 00:10:55,503
     So my theory is to help you
            to readjust to life.

283
00:10:55,505 --> 00:10:57,005
It's a great mantra.

284
00:10:57,007 --> 00:11:00,308
      Love from Ma's heart
  finds its way into the food.

285
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,577
                 Pork chop,
             red bean and rice.

286
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:06,614
    Fried pork chops. They're
tender, crispy, very delightful.

287
00:11:06,616 --> 00:11:09,050
     The red beans and rice,
    can't go wrong with that.

288
00:11:09,052 --> 00:11:10,819
   Now we're into
the famous pork chop.

289
00:11:10,821 --> 00:11:14,356
      You start with your flour,
          a little black pepper.

290
00:11:14,358 --> 00:11:15,824
               <i> Poquito</i> salt.

291
00:11:15,826 --> 00:11:18,259
We throw a little Spanish
in here every once in a while.

292
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:19,694
             -Onion.
            -Powder.

293
00:11:19,696 --> 00:11:21,596
          Paprika to give color.

294
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,531
             Garlic.
       -Creole seasoning.

295
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:25,066
  Give it a whisk.

296
00:11:25,068 --> 00:11:27,369
We got pork shoulder.
Tenderize it a little bit.

297
00:11:27,371 --> 00:11:28,403
             -Yeah.
           -I gotcha.

298
00:11:28,405 --> 00:11:29,571
                Flour, water.

299
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:31,072
   And then flour
   one more time?

300
00:11:31,074 --> 00:11:32,640
            I use my fryer, 300.

301
00:11:32,642 --> 00:11:34,242
What are we going to
 serve it with, Ma?

302
00:11:34,244 --> 00:11:35,510
             Red beans and rice.

303
00:11:35,512 --> 00:11:36,945
     17 minutes.

304
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,146
That's how long that took.

305
00:11:38,148 --> 00:11:39,581
   Why 17 minutes?

306
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,784
    'Cause you don't want to eat
                the hog raw.

307
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:44,853
                   Try it,
             you might like it.

308
00:11:46,857 --> 00:11:48,256
 That's a good chop.

309
00:11:48,258 --> 00:11:50,759
This is a lot of flavor
and just a little bit of batter.

310
00:11:54,264 --> 00:11:56,231
  Oh, the red beans
 and rice are good.

311
00:11:56,233 --> 00:11:57,632
Oh, you do that right.

312
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,267
That's a meal by itself.

313
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:00,568
 The food is great.

314
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:03,004
        But the love is greater.

315
00:12:03,006 --> 00:12:05,573
   The real deal.

316
00:12:05,575 --> 00:12:07,509
     Here's your pork chop.

317
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:10,378
The pork chop is excellent.
It's perfectly cooked.

318
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,314
       The beans are soft
     and smooth and creamy.

319
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:14,849
      Corn dogs and fries.

320
00:12:14,851 --> 00:12:17,152
    The closest I could come
     to being in New Orleans

321
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:19,154
    is coming to Ma Harper's.

322
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:20,822
              Amazing-licious.

323
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,657
  Amazing-licious?
     Watch out.

324
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,259
 When Ma gets a hold
 of amazing-licious,

325
00:12:24,261 --> 00:12:26,227
 she's going to make
a whole new rhyme about it.

326
00:12:26,229 --> 00:12:28,630
       Red bean and rice,
        everything nice.

327
00:12:28,632 --> 00:12:30,098
 Give me a one-liner
    before we go.

328
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,167
           89 in line and dying.

329
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:35,403
              Going to live 129
             and in good health.

330
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:36,604
         Remember that.

331
00:12:36,606 --> 00:12:38,339
                Let's go, Ma.

332
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:43,211
    Coming up, we're sticking
        in San Antonio...

333
00:12:43,213 --> 00:12:45,013
                There you go.
                There you go.

334
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,481
       ...for smoked meat
          sandwiches...

335
00:12:46,483 --> 00:12:47,649
              That's fantastic.

336
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:48,950
 ...with some surprising spins.

337
00:12:48,952 --> 00:12:50,718
    -I'm following your lead.
        -You'll like it.

338
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,461
  So I'm here on the east side
     of San Antonio, Texas,

339
00:12:59,463 --> 00:13:01,930
        in an area known
       as Dignowity Hill,

340
00:13:01,932 --> 00:13:04,766
     where an East Coast boy
       comes out to Texas

341
00:13:04,768 --> 00:13:06,201
  to go to school for finance.

342
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:07,368
        And what happens?

343
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,070
        He falls in love.

344
00:13:09,072 --> 00:13:10,405
     With barbecue, that is.

345
00:13:10,407 --> 00:13:12,040
      And now he's doing it
         his own way --

346
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:14,542
          smoking meats
    and making barbecue here

347
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,145
       at Dignowity Meats.

348
00:13:17,147 --> 00:13:18,847
     A bologna.

349
00:13:18,849 --> 00:13:21,349
  Dignowity's just this great,
        unassuming place

350
00:13:21,351 --> 00:13:23,318
         that serves up
       this amazing food.

351
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,652
              I got a pit beef.

352
00:13:24,654 --> 00:13:27,255
        Hanging out here,
    having beer and barbecue.

353
00:13:27,257 --> 00:13:28,590
      This is a fun place.

354
00:13:28,592 --> 00:13:30,692
     Beer and barbecue in Texas,
         who would have thought.

355
00:13:30,694 --> 00:13:32,894
 -Yeah, who would have thought.
   -Two smoked turkey caprese.

356
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,263
   What makes Andrew stand out
        is the attention

357
00:13:35,265 --> 00:13:36,931
 that he puts to each sandwich.

358
00:13:36,933 --> 00:13:39,067
'Cause chef and owner
   Andrew Samia

359
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:41,236
          has mad love
     for the deli sandwiches

360
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:43,438
         he grew up with
       on the East Coast,

361
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,840
         and he's adding
       a San Antonio spin

362
00:13:45,842 --> 00:13:47,876
        with Texas-style
          smoked meats.

363
00:13:47,878 --> 00:13:49,677
  I wanted to smoke
everything here in house,

364
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:51,079
   take everything
from start to finish,

365
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,947
and just kind of really do it
 the old-school way.

366
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:54,082
                 Where'd you
               learn to cook?

367
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,750
  Just being broke
     in college,

368
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,485
   watching a lot
  of Food Network,

369
00:13:57,487 --> 00:13:59,320
    Alton Brown,
a lot of "Triple D."

370
00:13:59,322 --> 00:14:00,522
                 Smart guy.

371
00:14:00,524 --> 00:14:02,290
      It's a lot of really
         classic items,

372
00:14:02,292 --> 00:14:04,792
   but everything's different
       from the ordinary.

373
00:14:04,794 --> 00:14:06,160
Your Burnt End Melt.

374
00:14:06,162 --> 00:14:07,862
The Burnt End Melt
   has burnt ends,

375
00:14:07,864 --> 00:14:09,597
         mac and cheese,
         melted cheese,

376
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,799
       and a little sliver
    of pear slipped in there.

377
00:14:11,801 --> 00:14:13,167
     It's really phenomenal.

378
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:14,369
                  What are
              we making first?

379
00:14:14,371 --> 00:14:16,437
This is going to be for our
Burnt End Melt sandwich.

380
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,439
Prime Angus brisket,
and we're going to --

381
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:19,574
                   Prime?
              Hang on a second.

382
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,544
          Angus in its own right
             is fantastic meat.

383
00:14:22,546 --> 00:14:24,712
          Prime is what you find
        in high-end restaurants.

384
00:14:24,714 --> 00:14:27,115
Yes, sir. First just going to
hit it with some kosher salt.

385
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:29,284
                           Okay.
And then coarse ground
    black pepper,

386
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:31,619
    Cajun spice,
and granulated garlic.

387
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,788
     Really giving it a gracious
              helping of this.

388
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,491
  Because what's going to happen
      is you'd take the knuckle,

389
00:14:36,493 --> 00:14:39,093
   and you'd cut these ends off,
        and then you'd go again.

390
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:40,828
        Well, it would look like
             these burnt pieces

391
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,231
        'cause you reseasoned it
              and resmoked it.
   Yep.

392
00:14:43,233 --> 00:14:45,667
      But you want to talk about
        the pièce de résistance.

393
00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:48,369
         So for you to be making
   a whole sandwich out of this,

394
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:49,504
      that's a give right there.

395
00:14:49,506 --> 00:14:50,939
              What kind of wood
              we smoking with?

396
00:14:50,941 --> 00:14:52,740
   Hickory chips.

397
00:14:52,742 --> 00:14:53,942
               Brisket's down.
               What's up next?

398
00:14:53,944 --> 00:14:55,443
 We're going to make
 our barbecue sauce.

399
00:14:55,445 --> 00:14:57,845
Ketchup, brown sugar,
      molasses.

400
00:14:57,847 --> 00:14:59,213
              Pineapple juice.

401
00:14:59,215 --> 00:15:01,182
 A little sweetness,
a little bit of tang, as well.

402
00:15:01,184 --> 00:15:02,917
       Water.
    Liquid Smoke.

403
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:04,485
      I got a waft of it as soon
               as I moved it.

404
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:05,887
     -Yeah, you smell that?
          -Dry mustard?

405
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:07,488
      Yes, sir.
 Granulated garlic.

406
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,023
     Cajun spice
  and kosher salt.

407
00:15:09,025 --> 00:15:12,894
   All right, so let this simmer
          down, simmer down now.

408
00:15:12,896 --> 00:15:15,430
Yes, sir. Now we're going to
season and sauce it.

409
00:15:15,432 --> 00:15:18,566
    Cajun spice,
a light brown sugar, our sauce.

410
00:15:18,568 --> 00:15:20,335
       And now mix it all?
           Absolutely.

411
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:22,270
 This is going to go
into the smoker on 250

412
00:15:22,272 --> 00:15:23,972
  for about an hour
and a half to two hours.

413
00:15:23,974 --> 00:15:25,573
      -And then it's done?
    -And then it's finished.

414
00:15:25,575 --> 00:15:28,109
         Just waiting on the mac
       and cheese. Let's see it.

415
00:15:28,111 --> 00:15:30,311
  Unsalted butter,
all-purpose flour, cold milk.

416
00:15:30,313 --> 00:15:31,713
       So make a basic Béchamel.

417
00:15:31,715 --> 00:15:33,448
I'm just going to add some
sharp cheddar cheese,

418
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:36,818
kosher salt, black pepper,
and our Cajun spice.

419
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,653
       Add the parboiled elbows.

420
00:15:38,655 --> 00:15:40,622
          -Absolutely.
     -Let's put it together.

421
00:15:40,624 --> 00:15:42,957
   -We got our mac and cheese.
  -Where's the bun coming from?

422
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,027
A local baker here in town.
Smoked brisket burnt ends.

423
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,295
    Sliced pear.

424
00:15:47,297 --> 00:15:48,997
       Everything's making sense
           except the pear, bud.

425
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:50,798
    I'm following your lead.
        -You'll like it.

426
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,067
Sharp cheddar cheese,
a little more barbecue sauce.

427
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:54,502
  Take a little bit
   of the top out.

428
00:15:54,504 --> 00:15:56,270
      Wow, you're really helping
       on the carbs, aren't you?

429
00:15:56,272 --> 00:15:58,206
That's so it's a little
health-more conscious.

430
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,340
          Health more?

431
00:15:59,342 --> 00:16:00,675
    A little more
  health conscious.

432
00:16:00,677 --> 00:16:02,010
          Health more conscious.

433
00:16:02,012 --> 00:16:03,978
         Come on down where it's
     health more conscious here.

434
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,446
And then on the press.

435
00:16:05,448 --> 00:16:08,116
  That's what I'm talking about.
        Bread on mac and cheese.

436
00:16:08,118 --> 00:16:09,550
     With fruit.

437
00:16:12,522 --> 00:16:13,588
 Does the pear play?

438
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,556
        Don't talk in the middle
               of a backswing.

439
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,025
                Remember when
               you were a kid,

440
00:16:17,027 --> 00:16:18,760
               and you'd wait
           for that report card?

441
00:16:18,762 --> 00:16:21,462
        Yeah.
I'm waiting right now.

442
00:16:21,464 --> 00:16:23,965
    -How does that feel now?
   -It's pretty nerve-racking.

443
00:16:23,967 --> 00:16:25,333
                I'm going to
             tell you something.

444
00:16:25,335 --> 00:16:28,703
               I'm going to be
                100% honest.

445
00:16:28,705 --> 00:16:30,038
              That's fantastic.

446
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,240
        -Thank you, Chef.
  -This is full of high notes.

447
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,609
              It's studded with
              these big pieces

448
00:16:34,611 --> 00:16:37,445
           of this super tender,
           but textural brisket.

449
00:16:37,447 --> 00:16:39,013
                Then you get
             the creamy cheese.

450
00:16:39,015 --> 00:16:41,315
    Then you get the little soft
             bit of the noodle.

451
00:16:41,317 --> 00:16:43,551
       The pear does give a nice
             little refreshing.

452
00:16:43,553 --> 00:16:46,854
        -A little crunch?
        -A little crunch,

453
00:16:46,856 --> 00:16:48,489
               a little sugar.

454
00:16:48,491 --> 00:16:50,224
                  It gives
            a little raw relief.

455
00:16:50,226 --> 00:16:52,126
        This is a lethal weapon.

456
00:16:52,128 --> 00:16:54,295
     You'd have to register this
               in Flavortown.

457
00:16:54,297 --> 00:16:55,830
We'll get its ID card,
    don't worry.

458
00:16:55,832 --> 00:16:57,632
       -Really impressive.
      -Thank you, brother.

459
00:16:57,634 --> 00:16:58,700
      Got a Burnt End Melt.

460
00:16:58,702 --> 00:17:00,168
The Burnt End Melt
 is really great.

461
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,269
       I mean,
it does have burnt ends.

462
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:03,304
They're very caramelized,
juicy on the inside.

463
00:17:03,306 --> 00:17:05,339
      -The pear seems odd.
       -It does seem odd.

464
00:17:05,341 --> 00:17:08,042
   -Yeah, but it's like candy.
       -Tastes delicious.

465
00:17:08,044 --> 00:17:09,877
        -Great sandwich.
       -Side of corn bake.

466
00:17:09,879 --> 00:17:11,946
 The food's spot on, lights out.

467
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,282
   Hard name to say, but it's
    an easy place to eat at.

468
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:15,583
              How did the name
                 come about?

469
00:17:15,585 --> 00:17:17,151
  Dignowity Hill is
the neighborhood we're in.

470
00:17:17,153 --> 00:17:18,586
It's during the Texas
     Revolution.

471
00:17:18,588 --> 00:17:20,354
Santa Ana had his troops
  here on the hill

472
00:17:20,356 --> 00:17:22,590
because he could see
all the way down to the Alamo.

473
00:17:22,592 --> 00:17:25,059
                   Got it.
  I'm so much more educated now.

474
00:17:25,061 --> 00:17:27,795
It's really convenient because
 it's very close to downtown,

475
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,330
   but it's not in the center
          of everything

476
00:17:29,332 --> 00:17:30,765
        where it's going
      to be super crowded.

477
00:17:30,767 --> 00:17:32,400
             I got to walk away
               from this one.

478
00:17:32,402 --> 00:17:34,802
  When we come back, we're going
       to do a real-deal Reuben.

479
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,137
           Reuben with
         a side of corn.

480
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:39,373
       The Reuben's great.
   The pastrami is delicious.

481
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,676
   I've never had another one
     like it in San Antonio.

482
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,051
 Welcome back. We're on the East
     Side of San Antonio, Texas,

483
00:17:50,053 --> 00:17:52,386
          hanging out at a funky
  little joint called Dignowity.

484
00:17:52,388 --> 00:17:54,055
             That's the mountain
              we're on, right?

485
00:17:54,057 --> 00:17:55,356
           The knoll?
        -Dignowity Hill.

486
00:17:55,358 --> 00:17:57,191
   -So you can see the Alamo.
     -You can see the Alamo.

487
00:17:57,193 --> 00:17:59,861
  I'm learning all about history
 and making some great barbecue.

488
00:17:59,863 --> 00:18:03,364
And it's all happening inside
 a funky former burger joint

489
00:18:03,366 --> 00:18:05,666
        where Chef Andrew
    is combining his passion

490
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,702
         for sandwiches
        and smoked meats.

491
00:18:07,704 --> 00:18:09,003
Two Reubens coming out.

492
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,272
The Reuben itself
  has pastrami, cheese,

493
00:18:11,274 --> 00:18:13,508
         and it's a very
         unique flavor.

494
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,644
  Sauerkraut, a nice, toasted,
          perfect bun.

495
00:18:16,646 --> 00:18:17,712
              What do you got?

496
00:18:17,714 --> 00:18:19,413
So the pastrami's a little
more traditional.

497
00:18:19,415 --> 00:18:20,782
        Same cut of beef.
       -So prime brisket.

498
00:18:20,784 --> 00:18:22,784
 We're going to make
a real basic brine for it.

499
00:18:22,786 --> 00:18:25,353
Put water, brown sugar,
coriander seed, kosher salt.

500
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,155
                There you go.
                There you go.

501
00:18:27,157 --> 00:18:28,222
Yellow mustard seed.

502
00:18:28,224 --> 00:18:29,857
          -Interesting.
        -Pickling spice.

503
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,592
          Curing salt.
          -You got it.

504
00:18:31,594 --> 00:18:33,528
 Bring it to a boil
so everything dissolves.

505
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,163
The flavors kind of wake up
    a little bit.

506
00:18:35,165 --> 00:18:37,165
Get it cool and pour
it over the brisket.

507
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:38,533
              How long is this
               going to brine?

508
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:40,601
  Over the weekend,
normally three or four days.

509
00:18:40,603 --> 00:18:42,670
           All right, how long's
                your weekend?

510
00:18:42,672 --> 00:18:44,405
              So a little rinse
           has happened to this,

511
00:18:44,407 --> 00:18:46,574
         but you can see some of
 the pickling spice still there.

512
00:18:46,576 --> 00:18:48,042
 Now we're going to
     season it.

513
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,344
Whole black peppercorn,
coriander seed, white sugar,

514
00:18:50,346 --> 00:18:52,513
   and some granulated garlic.
      -It's like a sundae.

515
00:18:52,515 --> 00:18:55,316
A hodgepodge of different-sized
 granules in there.

516
00:18:55,318 --> 00:18:57,084
                You know how
            to spell hodgepodge?

517
00:18:57,086 --> 00:18:58,519
          -No, I don't.
        -I don't, either.

518
00:18:58,521 --> 00:19:00,421
      I use it, but I don't know
              how to spell it.

519
00:19:00,423 --> 00:19:03,191
Into the smoker, 225 for about
   12 to 14 hours.

520
00:19:03,193 --> 00:19:05,359
                         Dig it.
So this is the pastrami
that we just smoked.

521
00:19:05,361 --> 00:19:06,627
                Look at that.

522
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:12,266
                Okay. Later.

523
00:19:12,268 --> 00:19:13,701
    Healthy amount of coriander.

524
00:19:13,703 --> 00:19:15,536
         The quality of the meat
               comes through.

525
00:19:15,538 --> 00:19:17,471
       Typically, you throw this
               on the slicer.

526
00:19:17,473 --> 00:19:18,906
  Yeah, typically.

527
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,174
        -Ribbing it out?
          -Absolutely.

528
00:19:20,176 --> 00:19:21,976
             Look at it, though.
                Great crust.

529
00:19:21,978 --> 00:19:23,110
      All right, let's build it.

530
00:19:23,112 --> 00:19:24,345
Some good Swiss cheese.

531
00:19:24,347 --> 00:19:25,580
Our house-smoked pastrami.

532
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:27,348
And then we're going to toast
      this up,

533
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:30,451
heat up the pastrami,
  melt the cheese.

534
00:19:30,453 --> 00:19:33,020
House Russian dressing,
     sauerkraut,

535
00:19:33,022 --> 00:19:35,523
     top it off
with the bread here.

536
00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:37,658
     -That's all she wrote?
           -That's it.

537
00:19:40,663 --> 00:19:42,930
   The fact you're bringing this
               to San Antonio

538
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,066
               speaks volumes
         about this relationship

539
00:19:45,068 --> 00:19:48,102
                that you have
 with smoking meats and barbecue

540
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,737
     and just your whole energy.

541
00:19:49,739 --> 00:19:51,973
      It's not super hard to do,
       but it's labor intensive.

542
00:19:51,975 --> 00:19:53,441
         It takes a lot of time.

543
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:55,643
     But I tell you, when you're
     in the mood for sauerkraut,

544
00:19:55,645 --> 00:19:58,779
                  pastrami,
      a little Russian dressing.

545
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,382
   Do I have any right there?
   -A little bit right there.

546
00:20:01,384 --> 00:20:04,018
          How long was it there?
       How long did he let me --

547
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,219
            Dynamite.
        -Thank you, Chef.

548
00:20:05,221 --> 00:20:06,787
          People are going to be
               showing up here

549
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,456
     trying to buy this pastrami
                by the pound.

550
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,957
      You better watch out.
       -Hey, we're ready.

551
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,359
                We're ready.
                  Bring it.

552
00:20:11,361 --> 00:20:13,060
       Reuben with a side
     of our mac and cheese.

553
00:20:13,062 --> 00:20:14,996
  The Russian dressing on this
         Reuben sandwich

554
00:20:14,998 --> 00:20:16,831
         kind of blends
    all the flavors together

555
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,332
   with cheese and the bread.

556
00:20:18,334 --> 00:20:20,568
    The toast is really good.
    It complements the meats.

557
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,936
A salumi and a pit beef.

558
00:20:21,938 --> 00:20:23,304
We have people
  from out of town.

559
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:25,306
We're always, like, "You have to
      come try Dignowity."

560
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:27,074
       What you're doing and how
  you're treating it, great job.

561
00:20:27,076 --> 00:20:30,044
 Thank you, brother.

562
00:20:30,046 --> 00:20:33,347
  Was that a road trip or what?
        But don't worry.

563
00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:35,850
   There's plenty more joints
  all over this great country.

564
00:20:35,852 --> 00:20:39,020
     I'll be looking for you
    next time on "Triple D."

565
00:20:39,022 --> 00:20:40,254
           Real deal.

566
00:20:40,256 --> 00:20:43,024
              Imitated by many,
             duplicated by none.

567
00:20:43,026 --> 00:20:45,826
  Imitated by many
and duplicated by none.

568
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,828
Remember that.
