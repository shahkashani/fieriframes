227
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,363
   The staff is so welcoming.   

228
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:47,365
         And the food --        
    it's never disappointing.   

229
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,100
       Knowing that Nick,       
        Domenica, and Guy       

230
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,502
      have known each other     
          for years --          

231
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:52,170
           Guy's part           
     of the Catelli family.     

232
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:54,105
  FIERI: You could consider me  
        a distant cousin        

233
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:57,042
 to Nick and Domenica Catelli...
       Spaghetti DC sauce!      

234
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:59,243
     ...the third-generation    
     brother-and-sister team    

235
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,645
     running the family biz.    

236
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,881
      My nonnie and nonno,      
       Virginia and Santi,      

237
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:05,183
    opened Catelli's in 1935.   

238
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:06,518
        How does it feel?       

239
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,919
                Uh, surreal.    

240
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:09,521
      NICK: You're walking      
      in your grandparents'     

241
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:11,523
   and your father's footsteps  
  through this whole building.  

242
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:14,059
    FIERI: But his baby steps   
     started out in a placed    

243
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:15,727
I know a little something about.

244
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,062
                Here you go.    

245
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:18,462
      Didn't know that one      
     of the greatest things     

246
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:19,664
 I would get a chance to see is 

247
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,799
       somebody that came       
       from my restaurant       

248
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,134
          move on to do         
       his own restaurant.      

249
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,669
    NICK: Started               
as a dishwasher and a busboy,   

250
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,404
and then ended up working       
   for the company              

251
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:28,739
  for 13-1/2 years              
 in every position.             

252
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,209
          Your dad still owes me
        for giving you that job.

253
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:33,278
       That's Nick's dad,       
          right there.          

254
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,814
        You owe me, like,       
  12 Father's Day cards, Rich.  

255
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:39,083
      We've known Guy since     
     before he was "Guy" --     

256
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,418
         20-plus years.         

257
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,686
         -That's a del.         
              -Wow.             

258
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:42,820
     -You been working out?     
          -Yes, I have.         

259
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,356
  Just on that arm,             
       though.                  

260
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:45,356
                [ Chuckles ]    

261
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,225
       When we were first       
          on "Diners,"          

262
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,694
          Guy featured          
      our meatball sliders.     

263
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,496
          DOMENICA: Organic beef
     and our house-made sausage.

264
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:53,231
             -Okay.             
        -Ricotta cheese.        

265
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:55,433
         This is my mix of panko
             and Gruyère cheese.

266
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:56,434
                   Onion.       

267
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:57,235
                   Garlic.      
        Garlic.                 

268
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:58,436
              This one's Parm.  

269
00:08:58,438 --> 00:08:59,304
            -Parsley?           
        -Italian parsley.       

270
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:00,572
              An egg in there.  

271
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:02,641
     -Mix all this together.    
        -Bake them first?       

272
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:04,376
               No, we do them   
         in a cast-iron skillet.

273
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:05,843
  Hang on a second.             

274
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,779
              We cook them raw  
                  to order.     

275
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:10,382
You cook them raw to order      
    for every one               

276
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:11,316
      that goes                 
 to the dining room?            

277
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:13,584
                    Yes.        
 You are crazy.                 

278
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,253
   I'm coming back              
  after this airs,              

279
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:17,255
 see if you're still            
cooking these from raw.         

280
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:18,523
     As business has grown,     

281
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:20,325
      we've needed to find      
     how we can streamline.     

282
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:22,126
     And what we've found is    
        by throwing them        

283
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,695
      in the fryer quickly,     
   they take a lot less time.   

284
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:28,199
FIERI: But was hasn't changed is
 how she makes her DC red sauce.

285
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:29,401
        "DC," you get it?       

286
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:32,604
        Domenica Catelli!       

287
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:35,740
Extra-virgin olive oil, garlic, 
 hot pepper flakes.             

288
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,609
        Organic tomatoes.       
          -California?          

289
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:39,010
              -Yes.             
 -And just a little bit of salt?

290
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:40,412
      Yep.                      
              How long will you 
             just let this cook?

291
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:41,813
       -For about an hour.      
            -Love it.           

292
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,147
 They go on the buns            

293
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,283
and then we're gonna            
pour the sauce over them        

294
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,485
 and cheese them up             
with a little bit of parsley.   

295
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,955
             -Nice.             
    -Tell me what you think.    

296
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,090
 Delicious meatball.            

297
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,224
It melts in your mouth          
  when you eat it.              

298
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:54,426
             No arguments here. 

299
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,693
           -Great job.          
           -Thank you.          

300
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:56,827
     FIERI: And these days,     

301
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,897
      Domenica's spicing up     
         some new dishes        

302
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:01,232
          with the same         
      righteous red sauced.     

303
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,768
         Clam, calamari,        
       and sausage sauté.       

304
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,038
     First, I'm going to add    
     our house-made sausage.    

305
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,907
     And then as that starts    
     to cook and get brown,     

306
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:11,175
      add our local clams,      

307
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:14,379
   a little bit of white wine,  
        and tomato sauce.       

308
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:16,914
          Let that cook         
       for a few minutes.       

309
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:17,982
       Then I'm gonna add       

310
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,917
            our fresh           
    Monterey-baked calamari.    

311
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,054
 It's just a perfect poor-man's 
      Chapino, I would say.     

312
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:24,723
 You got the clam, the calamari,

313
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:26,724
          the sausage,          
      all in the red sauce.     

314
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,727
       -This is authentic.      
        -It is fantastic.       

315
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:30,061
  Everything is to perfection.  

316
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:32,063
     What are we gonna make?    

317
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,531
                We are making   
              the rav filling.  

318
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,266
                 Pork butt.     
              Big beef chunks.  

319
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:36,600
            -Chicken.           
            -Skin-on.           

320
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:37,936
              And then, here's  
         our house-made sausage.

321
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:39,604
               And we're gonna  
                 roast this.    

322
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:40,739
    Going at 450                
    for how long?               

323
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:42,206
              30 to 40 minutes. 

324
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,409
  -We have to mix all our veg.  
             -Okay.             

325
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:46,478
          Onion, celery, garlic,

326
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,546
         extra virgin olive oil,
                Swiss chard.    

327
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:49,414
   Look at this --              

328
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,149
 such great texture,            
    great flavor.               

329
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,283
           Salt and pepper, yep.

330
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:53,417
                  And then      
             that's gonna go in.

331
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,086
         -Into the oven?        
     -For about 40 minutes.     

332
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:56,688
           -All right.          
 -You're gonna dump the meat... 

333
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,022
        -And the juices.        
         -...into there.        

334
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:59,357
Oh, it smells awesome.          

335
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:01,158
    So, the bread               
   gets mixed in.               

336
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,626
           Let's get all the veg
                  in there.     

337
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:05,763
             Now we're gonna put
      the Pecorino and Parmesan.

338
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,031
 Then we're gonna go            
   to the grinder.              

339
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,099
                    Yes.        

340
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:09,500
Now, I can't hold this          
  and be over there             

341
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,835
 eating any of that             
  at the same time.             

342
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,037
    -That's part of the plan.   
         -Look at that.         

343
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,172
            And you can taste it
               at this point.   
     Mmm!                       

344
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:18,242
You put that in a flip-flop,    
that would taste good.          

345
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:19,577
          We're making the dough
             for the ravioli -- 

346
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,780
                   simple       
            Italian-style dough.

347
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:23,314
       Some people add stuff in.
                  We don't.     

348
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:24,381
             -Okay.             
      -It's eggs and flour.     

349
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:25,383
And the cool thing is,          

350
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:27,519
is Ben Franklin lets you        
   use his mixer!               

351
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:28,586
        What?                   

352
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:29,721
      FIERI: And that's not     
         the only thing         

353
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:32,056
     old-school around here.    

354
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,658
 This thing's gonna             
   hurt somebody.               

355
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,860
       We're following all      
  of Nonnie's kitchen rules...  

356
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,596
        -Can you read it?       
          -That's nuts.         

357
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:39,664
      ...when we come back.     

358
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:40,865
            It's like an "Oprah"
                  episode.      

359
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:41,866
                My goodness.    

360
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,902
I'm not giving away any         
 free cars, though.             

361
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,979
    So, I'm in Geyserville --   

362
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:56,715
       Northern California      
         wine-country --        

363
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:59,350
    to check out a place that   
   I've got some history with.  

364
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:01,986
      You see, Nick Catelli     
   worked his way up the ranks  

365
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:03,521
   in my NorCal restaurant...   

366
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:04,789
  Can I get you anything else?  

367
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,457
     FIERI: ...then reopened    
       his family's place       

368
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,792
   with his sister, Domenica.   

369
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:09,794
To see what's happening         
 for the two of you,            

370
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:11,796
    as my friends               
and working together,           

371
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:13,665
and knowing how hard            
you worked as a chef --         

372
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:14,732
        it chokes me up.        

373
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,733
            It's like an "Oprah"
                  episode.      

374
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,001
                My goodness.    

375
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,737
 I'm not giving away

376
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:22,072
    FIERI: Catelli's has been   
    in the family since 1935,   

377
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:25,409
        and, apparently,        
  so has the kitchen equipment. 

378
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,078
The Smithsonian called.         

379
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,547
They want their first grinder   
   ever made back.              

380
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:30,882
And the cool thing is,          

381
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:33,150
is Ben Franklin lets you        
   use his mixer!               

382
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,152
        What?                   

383
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,154
       But it's their take      
         on the recipes         

384
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:38,356
    Nonnie and Nonno Catelli    
           passed down          

385
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:40,692
      that make this place      
       bona fide Italian,       

386
00:12:40,694 --> 00:12:42,627
like their scratch-made ravioli.

387
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,328
              So, this is gonna 
               be around one.   

388
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,831
                Crank it down   
            and just keep going.

389
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,299
How many times is this          
  gonna go through?             

390
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,500
                   Eleven.      

391
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,168
  You got 27 hours              
   in a day here?               

392
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,537
              Okay, we're going 
                down to one,    

393
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:54,639
          and this is when we're
       gonna read the newspaper.

394
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:57,108
        -Can you read it?       
          -That's nuts.         

395
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,309
           So, the meat filling.

396
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:02,981
       Put it into a pastry bag,
              and go like that. 

397
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:04,249
This is like therapy.           

398
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:05,717
     I feel good                
      about me.                 

399
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:07,652
              Lay this on top,  
                 press down,    

400
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:08,787
               and we're gonna  
        make our little squares,

401
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,321
               so then you can  
               make it pretty.  

402
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:12,323
 What fantastic-ness            
are you tossing that in?        

403
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,325
               Butter, garlic,  
               salt, parsley,   

404
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:15,860
                 and a pinch    
             of Parmesan cheese.

405
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:18,262
                   Mangia.      

406
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:19,797
   It's so tender.              

407
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,933
     Perfection                 
  is what this is.              

408
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:23,868
This is one of the best raviolis
   I've ever had.               

409
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,469
                 Thank you.     

410

  in those noodles              

411
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:29,740
 in a brand-new way.            

412
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,010
     Our lasagna's a traditional
               Italian style,   

413
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:34,078
            which is really thin
               layers of pasta  

414
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,347
              with thin layers  
            of sauce in-between.

415
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:39,817
            DOMENICA:           
   The cheese filling consists  
    of sheep's milk ricotta,    

416
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,287
         and we also use        
    whole-milk cow's ricotta.   

417
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:45,556
     Egg yolks, goat cheese,    
      fresh-ground pepper,      

418
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:46,957
        and kosher salt.        

419
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,893
         Parmesan, mint.        

420
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:50,428
  Finish that with some nutmeg. 

421
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,096
     Give this a final mix,     

422
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:54,365
    and then I'm gonna start    
       layering the pasta.

424
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:57,969

    with cheese and Parmesan    

425
00:13:57,971 --> 00:13:59,236
   and another layer of pasta.  

426
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,572
    And then we're just gonna   
  keep building on top of that
