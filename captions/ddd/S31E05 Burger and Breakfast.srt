00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:03,735
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
     and we're rolling out,

00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:09,007
                  Come on.

00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,676
         ...we're going

00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:12,077
    There you go!

00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:13,479
   ...to outrageous burgers...  

9
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:15,147

               You got an issue.
And that issue's delicious.

00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,420
     ...like sugar and spice

00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:23,355
      How would                 
  you attack this?

         That really embarrasses
               a lot of pies.

        Why is everybody in such
   a frenzy about Sin of Cortez?

WOMAN: Thank you.               

58
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:56,848
     Cortez French toast is     
      one of my favorites.      

59
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,650
it's not your usual Texas toast.

60
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:00,452
        It's got cinnamon       
       running through it.      

61
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:01,520
         It's delicious.        

62
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:03,722
    We're making                
our Cortez French toast         

63
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:05,056
 with our house-made            
   cinnamon bread.              

64
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,792
Everything in this building,    
      we bake.                  

65
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,460
   So, here we've               
got our yeast rising.           

66
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:09,795
   That looks like when somebody
             doesn't know how to

67
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,330
               do the laundry   
  and they put in too much soap.

68
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:13,798
We'll start with oil.           
         Well, that party ended.

69
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,002
                And now the egg?
We're gonna take our flour,     
put it in our mixer.            

70
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:20,338
I mean, I'm no baker,           
but the 2 cups on the floor     

71
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,140
probably should stay            
    in the bowl.                

72
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,809
            Well, that's the sin
                 of Cortez.     

73
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,611
        Salt, sugar, shortening.

74
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:26,945
    Is this gonna               
   make it all in?              

75
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:28,413
              We're gonna stir  
          little bits at a time.

76
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:30,415
So, we let this mix,            
    let it proof.               
                            Yep.

77
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:32,484
           Now we're gonna make 
           the cinnamon mixture.
Okay.                           

78
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,353
           So, we're gonna start
           with softened butter,

79
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:35,821
          brown sugar, cinnamon.

80

81
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:39,157
     And then we're gonna slowly
        add the bread crumbs in.

82
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,291
     All right,                 
  how many ounces?              

83
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,027
                   2 pounds.    
87,000 ounces.                  

84
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:43,161
    I rounded up.               

85
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,096
             Fill a whole bunch 
        of the cinnamon mixture.

86
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:46,898
        Whoa!                   
     More sugar?                

87
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,233

89
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,038
   Were gonna put it in the oven
          at 350 for 40 minutes.

90
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,306
 That's a big loaf.             

91
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:56,708
       Our batter's a little bit
    more milk heavy than others.

92
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:00,312
          I'm going to use eggs,
   chocolate, brown sugar, milk.

93
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:01,713
       You are                  
  very milk heavy.

cinnamon-roll monster.          

95

98

100
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,860
  So, I'm not a big

a big sweets person.            

102
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:20,532
When I heard that you were doing
this cinnamon French toast,     

103
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,068
I thought, "It's gonna be       
  too much for me."             

104
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,069
    You dumped in               
   all the sugar,               

105
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,737
 and then you dumped            
   in more sugar,               

106
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,140
  but what it's not             
    is too much.                

107
00:03:28,142 --> 00:03:29,474
   It's delicious.              

108
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,676
There's a lot of things that    
shouldn't be working            

109
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:35,013
that really do, like the extra  
milk inside of the batter.      

110
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,614
The density of the bread        

111
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,817
is such that it really          
 does need the milk,            

112
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,218
  and then it cooks             
  on the flat top,              

113
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,754
it kind of steams it            
so it becomes nice and light.   

114
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,022

  becoming a restaurant owner.

      You were                  
a mechanical engineer?          
                           Yeah.

236
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:00,345

                  you know,     

237

It's the same thing.            

238

                  Exactly.

00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,417

  around fresh and local fare.

00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:10,288
 This area has such             
  strong resources,             

242
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,757
and to get to showcase          
  them is amazing.

    I have a salmon gravlax.    

244
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:16,895
    In the Pacific Northwest,   
     salmon is very popular.    

245
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:19,431
     And the salmon gravlax     
       on the homemade rye      

246
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:21,232
      is a beautiful dish.      

247
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:24,903
   Really fresh, high quality.  
          It is unique.         

248
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:27,305
All right, so, what             
are we making first?            
           We're gonna start out
             with our rye bread.

249
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,441
        We mill our whole grains
                here on site.   

250
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:31,242
Of course we do.                
                   This is      
             a Turkey Red wheat.

251
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,577
         It's an heirloom grain.
Okay.

Wow!                            

254
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,716
 Look at that, huh?             

255
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:40,518
       This is another rye berry

 [ Whirring, grinding continue ]

257
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:46,124
So, this is the Turkey Red wheat
        and then the rye, water.

258
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,192
  And the starter?              
                            Yep.

259
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,860
So, this is natural yeast?      
                           Yeah.

260
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:52,463
 You do this about 8 to 12 hours
before you mix your final dough.

261
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,198
     Then mix it                
 with more flour...             
                         Salt...

263
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:58,637
     about an hour bulk ferment,
    and then they're gonna rest,

264
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,071

Proof, into the oven.           

267
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:04,075
   It goes for about 30 minutes.

268
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:07,211
     We start it at 500 and then
 drop it to about 475 to finish.

269
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,947
You know what I have            
 to say about that?

00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:12,817
            This is our gravlax.

273
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:14,419
             We've got this nice
            sockeye salmon here.

274
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:16,220
            We're just gonna put
             a little oil down. 

275
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,356
              Hit it with some  
                 lemon zest.    
Zest is the best.               

276
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,625
             Oh, yeah, totally. 
   And then we've got some dill.

             Beets go down next.

278
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:23,761
           We got our dry rub --
        so, this is brown sugar,

I like it.                      
       Hit it with your dry rub.

281
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,901
    And how long                
is this gravlax gonna take?     

282
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,702
      About 36 to 48 hours.

   a lot of heat.               

286
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:38,376
It'll stay primarily as a raw,  
 cold-smoked salmon.            
                        Exactly.

287
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:39,911

                    Let's do it.

   I'd honestly prefer it over  
      a bacon cheeseburger.

           It's great.

        The basis of a great pie

                 All right,     
                let's see it.   

472
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:03,995
So, what we start with          
is all-purpose flour, sugar,    

473
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:06,464
salt, unsalted cold butter,     
  and that's, like,             

474
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,534
  the tip to making             
the flaky, buttery layers.      

475
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:13,003
      Never in my life seen that
     much butter-to-flour ratio.

00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,139

480
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:22,413
The acid's gonna help           
break down the gluten,          

481
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:24,282

503

   like the glue,
