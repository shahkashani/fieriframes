      ON THE FOOD.

YOU'VE TAKEN THIS TOWN

196
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,356
      YOU WERE                  
A USED CAR SALESMAN?            
                            YES.

  <i> HIS MOM'S FAMILY RECIPES.</i>    
              PICCADILLO COMING.

199
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,566
       BLUE PLATE SPECIAL       
          CUBAN FOOD.           

200
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:23,635
    WHAT ARE                    
WE MAKING FIRST?                
        WE'RE MAKING PICCADILLO,

201
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:27,372
     WHICH IS ONE OF THE STAPLES
           OF THE CUBAN...      
LOVE PICCADILLO.                

202
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:30,107
        YOU'RE GONNA LOVE MINE, 
      'CAUSE IT'S THE REAL DEAL.
OKAY, LET'S START IT.           

203
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,510
      WHAT ARE WE GOING IN WITH,
               SOFRITO?         
YEAH, VERY GOOD.                

204
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,380
ONIONS, GARLIC, AND PEPPERS,    
    A LITTLE BIT OF OIL.        
               ALREADY IN THERE?
                     OKAY.      

205
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:38,049
THEN WE'RE GONNA PUT            
SOME BURGER IN THERE.           
              80-20 GROUND BEEF?

206
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,252
80-20. WE'RE JUST GONNA         
BROWN THIS A LITTLE BIT.        

207
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:42,720
      SO WE GOT RED BELL PEPPER,
          GREEN BELL PEPPER,    

208
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,123
              NOT A SPICY PEPPER
                 NECESSARILY.   
NO.                             

209
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:48,125
WE'RE GONNA PUT IN              
   THE SAZóN.                   
      THIS IS THE SEASONED SALT,
        LIKE IN AMERICAN FOOD.  

210
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,661
EXACTLY.                        
          THIS IS THE EQUIVALENT
              IN LATIN FOOD.    

211
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,663
            (sighs) IT'S ALREADY
              SMELLING AWESOME. 

212
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,599
                  SO THE MEAT'S 
                ALL COOKED DOWN.

213
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,601
            THE PEPPERS, GARLIC,
               AND THE ONIONS   

214
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:58,537
        HAVE ALMOST DISAPPEARED.
CORRECT.                        

215
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,539
          LOOK AT HOW THE MEAT'S
              ALL SEPARATED.    

216
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,341
          YOU SEE THAT?         
LITTLE GRANULES, NOT BIG CHUNKS.
WE'RE GONNA ADD                 
 WHITE WINE...                  

217
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:05,343
            NICE AMOUNT OF THAT.
DICED TOMATOES...               

218
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:07,345
                   TOMATO SAUCE.
A LITTLE TOMATO SAUCE.          

219
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,847
NOW WE'RE GONNA ADD             
 THE GREEN OLIVES.              
           OH, MY FAVORITE PART.

220
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,216
    I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF OLIVES
            IN MINE, MAN.       

221
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,685
         WHAT YOU GET IS A NICE,
           BRINY BITE TO THIS.  
ADD THE BAY LEAVES NOW          

222
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,688
AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST,         
  WHOLE SWEET PEPPER,           

223
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,157
 WHICH IS A STAPLE              
OF CUBAN SEASONINGS.            
                           OKAY.

224
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,626
WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD            
  AND COVER IT UP.              
               AND HOW LONG'S IT
                   GONNA GO?    

225
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:23,828
ABOUT HALF AN HOUR OR SO.       
     TAKE THIS OFF.             

226
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,164
   AS YOU CAN SEE,              
IT'S NICE AND STEAMY.           
              STEAMY AND DREAMY.

227
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,166
NOW...                          
      SOME PARBOILED WHITE RICE.

228
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:30,168
CORRECT. DO IT LIKE THAT.       

229
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,370
        AND YOU SAID            
YOU LIKED OLIVES, ABSOLUTELY.   
                             OH.

230
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:34,505
       WE'RE GONNA PUT IT THERE.
           GET THE PLANTAINS.   

231
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,641
          THESE ARE SUPER SWEET.
I'M NOT KIDDING YOU.            

232
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:39,310
THIS IS SOME OF MY FAVORITE FOOD
IN THE WORLD. I LOVE CUBAN FOOD.

233
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,780
OH, CAN YOU SMELL IT?           
 YOU CAN'T SMELL IT.            

234
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:44,449
MMM. DUDE, THAT'S AWESOME.      
           MMM.                 

235
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,851
 WHEN YOU'RE EATING             
THE BRINY, SALTINESS            

236
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:49,788
OF THIS MEAT AND THE TOMATOES   
      AND THE SOFRITO,          

237
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,656
      AND THEN                  
YOU COUNTERBALANCE IT           

238
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:53,725
  WITH A LITTLE BIT             
OF THE SWEET PLANTAIN,          

239
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:55,660
GREAT FLAVOR,                   
GREAT TEXTURE.                  

240
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,729
MMM. THIS IS JUST HONEST.       
       REAL DEAL.               

241
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:00,598
      EXCELLENT.                
THAT IS THE REAL DEAL.          
          PICCADILLOS           
        PICK UP, PLEASE.        

242
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,468
           DELICIOUS.           
(man) COOKED PERFECTLY,         
   REALLY FLAVORFUL,            

243
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,205
BUT NOT TOO SPICY.              
          GROUND BEEF,          
     TOMATO, GREEN OLIVES.      

244
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,407
       (Guy) I MEAN,            
THAT'S THE BOMB RIGHT THERE.    
                      IT IS.    
                 IT'S FANTASTIC.

245
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,943
     I JUST LOVE HIS FOOD.      
                 I HAVE         
        A TASTE OF CUBA FOR YOU.

246
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,078
         I'VE HAD CUBAN ALL OVER
            THE UNITED STATES,  

247
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,615
          AND IT IS AS AUTHENTIC
         AS YOU'RE GOING TO GET.
     PICK UP, LECHON ASADO.     

248
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:21,219
YOU MADE A PRETTY BIG STATEMENT 
WHEN YOU SAY “REAL CUBAN FOOD.” 
                     ABSOLUTELY.

249
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:23,221
   THAT MEANS THAT              
YOU CAN'T CUT CORNERS.          

250
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:25,957
     THAT MEANS                 
YOU CAN'T PLAY GAMES.           
     CAN'T HAVE A TUNA FISH WRAP
             ON THE MENU.       

251
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,226
    <i> BUT YOU DO HAVE TO HAVE</i>    
  <i> TO HAVE A CUBAN SANDWICH...</i>  

252
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,695
 THIS PUTS EVERY OTHER          
CUBAN SANDWICH TO SHAME.        

253
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:32,897
          <i> PAELLA...</i>            
INCREDIBLY FLAVORFUL.           
         MMM.                   

254
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:35,566
     <i> AND THIS CLASSIC...</i>       
               I GOT THE BOLICHE
               COMING UP, KATHY.

255
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:38,570
        <i> SAUSAGE STUFFED</i>        
     <i> IN A ROUND OF BEEF.</i>       
           IT'S VERY, VERY GOOD.

256
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:40,972
THE NEXT ONE IS...              
                        BOLICHE.

257
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,641
TAKE IT ON, MAESTRO.            
               WE'RE GONNA TRIM 
             AN EYE ROUND ROAST.

258
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,710
OKAY.                           
               WE CUT IT IN HALF
                   LIKE THIS,   

259
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:47,779
                AND THEN WE GO  
             TO THE MIDDLE OF IT

260
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:50,115
          AND MAKE A HOLE       
  ALMOST ALL THE WAY TO THE END.

261
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:53,251
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO           
      WITH THAT?                
    OH, THAT IS FOR MY HELP.    
THAT'S WHAT THEY GET AS A BONUS.

262
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:55,253
THAT'S THEIR SNACK.             
       OKAY.                    
                      THAT'S IT.

263
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,722
   SO YOU TAKE                  
SOME RAW CHORIZO.               
            AND THEN WE STUFF IT
                  IN THERE.     

264
00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:00,124
STUFF IT INSIDE THERE.          
        NICE.                   
                     FILL IT UP.

265
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:03,861
 IS THE GOAL TO NOT GO          
ALL THE WAY TO THE END?         
           WE'RE GONNA COOK IT  
         IN THE PRESSURE COOKER.

266
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:06,464
    IF YOU GET ALL THE WAY TO   
 THE END, YOU CAN'T HAVE IT CUT,

267
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:08,533
         BECAUSE THEN IT'S GONNA
               FALL APART.      
GOT IT.                         

268
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:11,269
                  DO YOU FOLLOW 
                WHAT I'M SAYING?
NO, I GOT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.   
     OKAY, SO NOW WHAT?         

269
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,671
                 WE'RE GONNA GET
                   THE SAZóN.   
         GOT IT.                
AND WE'RE GONNA SA-SEASON.      

270
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,474
                        EXACTLY.
WE'RE SA-SEASONING              
 WITH THE SAZóN.                

271
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,476
NOW WE'RE GONNA COME            
     OVER HERE.                 

272
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:20,812
THIS IS THE PRESSURE COOKER     
    THAT WE COOK IT IN.         

273
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:23,281
GET THE OIL, YOUR SOFRITO. TURN 
THE HEAT DOWN JUST A LITTLE BIT.
                           YEAH.

274
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:25,216
IT'S JUST STARTING              
TO GET TRANSLUCENT.             

275
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:27,619
   PLACE IT                     
RIGHT IN THERE.                 
    OH, THIS IS GONNA BE KILLER.
          BROWN BOTH SIDES?     

276
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:29,821
EXACTLY. WHITE WINE IN THERE,   
         BEEF BROTH.            

277
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:31,689
  WE HAVE A DISH                
CALLED ROPA VIEJA.              

278
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,625
  WE SAVE THE BEEF BROTH,       
AND THEN WE USE THAT THERE.     
           'CAUSE THE ROPA VIEJA

279
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:37,495
  DOESN'T HAVE NEARLY THE AMOUNT
   OF SEASONING THAT THIS DOES. 
CORRECT.                        

280
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:39,497
                  SEE?          
       I'M GONNA PASS THE CLASS.

281
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,566
DICED TOMATOES...               
              OKAY. BAY LEAVES. 

282
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:43,568
WHOLE SWEET PEPPER.             
  COVER THIS UP,                

283
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,170
BRING IT UP UNTIL IT STARTS     
 RELEASING THE PRESSURE...      
                          RIGHT.

284
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,239
  TURN IT DOWN FOR,             
I WOULD SAY, AN HOUR.           

285
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,241
(Guy) SO NOW WE'VE COOKED IT,   
         COOLED IT.             
                UH-HUH. CORRECT.

286
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,977
NOW WHAT HAPPENS?               
  I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND PORTION
     IT OUT, NICE, THICK CUT.   

287
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:56,448
   THEN WHAT WE DO IS COME OVER 
  HERE. WE ADD SOME SAUCE TO IT.

288
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,916
              THAT CAME OUT     
         OF THE PRESSURE COOKER.
PRESSURE COOKER,                
   EXACTLY.                     

289
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:01,586
WE GO LIKE THIS.                
     OH, SEE, LOOK AT HOW THAT'S
      JUST GONNA TEAR APART. OH.

290
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:03,988
TURN UP THE HEAT A LITTLE BIT,  
   AND THEN WE COVER IT UP,     

291
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,057
    AND IT'LL BE                
ABOUT THREE MINUTES.            
                           OKAY.

292
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,059
THAT'S REAL NICE AND HEATED.    
        REMOVE THIS.            

293
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,329
             HERE WE GO.        
    I'M GONNA GET THE PLANTAINS.
MMM.                            

294
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:13,731
                   THERE YOU GO.
NOW IS THIS BLACK BEANS         
  OR BLACK BEAN SOUP?           

295
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,600
                           BOTH.
MMM.                            

296
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:18,136
NOW THIS IS THE GREAT THING     
ABOUT THE EYE OF THE ROUND.     

297
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:20,471
 SEE HOW IT'S JUST              
PULLING APART? MMM.             

298
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:23,675
THE SAUCE ON TOP OF IT, DUDE,   
IT IS JUST PACKED WITH FLAVOR.  

299
00:12:23,677 --> 00:12:25,676
MMM. OOH.                       

300
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:27,946
AND YOU GET SOME OF THAT RICE   
  IN THERE, THOSE TOMATOES.     

301
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:30,148
THERE'S SO MUCH FLAVOR          
AND SO MUCH CONTRAST,           

302
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,284
AND THEN THE BEANS--            
   THAT'S 100%...

00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,870
                LET ME ASK YOU  
              ABOUT YOUR GINGER,

454
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:02,006
                I MEAN,         
          QUITE ENLARGED CHUNKS.
     BUT IT SOFTENS UP,         
AND IT GIVES IT A NICE BITE.    

455
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,408
FRESH LEMON ZEST.               
                       SOME EGG.

456
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,144
   ALL RIGHT,                   
ONE AT A TIME...                
                   THERE YOU GO.

457
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,281
LET THEM INCORPORATE.           
      OKAY. JUST GET THE SPATULA
            DOWN IN THERE.      

458
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:12,349
   OKAY, SO THAT'S ALL MIXED UP.

459
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:15,419
        NOW THE DRY INGREDIENTS?
WE'RE GONNA ALTERNATE           
    WET AND DRY.                

460
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:18,623
WE'VE GOT SOME BOILING WATER    
WITH SOME BAKING SODA IN IT.    
                         REALLY?

461
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:22,426
YEAH. FIRST I'M GONNA PUT ABOUT 
1/3 OF THE DRY INGREDIENTS IN.  

462
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,562
                      FANTASTIC.
BOILING WATER.                  

463
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:26,297
                           OKAY.
LET IT RIP. OKAY.               

464
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,699
             WANT ME TO PUT     
       THE REST OF THE FLOUR IN?
YEAH. ONCE AGAIN.               

465
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:31,168
                 IT'S SMELLING  
               LIKE GINGERBREAD.
BOILING WATER.                  

466
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,704
             GO BIG, GO, GO, GO.
                 CHUG. CHUG.    

467
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:36,373
             IT'S A LOT OF WORK.
 HE'S DOING                     
ALL THE WORK.                   

468
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,776
   FOR SOME REASON              
THIS RECIPE WORKS BEST          

469
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:41,646
 IF YOU MIX IT ON HIGH          
FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES.        

470
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:43,714
OTHERWISE YOU GET               
  A FLAT CAKE.                  
                         REALLY?

471
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,649
       MM-HMM.                  
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOOD.          

472
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:48,119
  NOW WE'RE GONNA TAKE IT OUT   
OF THE BOWL, PUT IT IN THE PAN, 

473
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:50,520
BAKE IT FOR 1 HOUR              
     AT 350.                    
                           NICE.

474
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,990
                     AH.        
             I LOVE GINGERBREAD.
GOOD.                           

475
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:54,792
I'M GONNA PORTION IT UP.        

476
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:57,128
     WE'RE GONNA SERVE IT       
WITH SOME FRESH WHIPPED CREAM.  
                            MMM.

477
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,197
 SPRINKLE POWDERED SUGAR,       
A LITTLE PRETTY ON THE TOP.     

478
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:04,001
THAT'S IT.                      
                   MMM.         
          THIS IS OUT OF BOUNDS.

479
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:06,270
       IT'S SO LIGHT AND TENDER,

480
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:08,539
        JUST LIKE WHEN YOU SAID 
      WHEN WE WERE MIXING IT UP.

481
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,142
  AND THE GINGER, USING THE REAL
      GINGER, THAT'S THE KEY.   
MM-HMM.

LIGHT, SPICY, A PERFECT END     
     TO A PERFECT MEAL.
