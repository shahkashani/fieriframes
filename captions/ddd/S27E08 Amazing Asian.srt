00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:24,395
we were doing a boutique        
seafood distribution.           

118
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,330
                    Okay.       

119
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,265
Hence the weird location.       

120
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:30,134
But then Sandy hit us,          
 we got flooded, we --          

121
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,736

Yeah. It was a mess.            

122
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:32,871
                    Really?     
   Yeah, yeah.                  

123
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,673
               So you came in,  
             you built this out.

124
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:37,142
I always wanted to do, you know,
Vietnamese street food.         

125
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,611

     became the inspiration

    the menu is pure comfort.   

127

00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:32,022
                 Breaks down    
             quickly and evenly.

447
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:33,691
Typically, we let it marinate   
     for a couple hours         

448
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:34,759
 before we grill it.            

449
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:35,893
            Now we're gonna make
                 the sauce.     

450
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:37,762
So we're just gonna take        
the chilies, garlic,            

451
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:39,964
dump them in the Robot Coupe,   
pulse that up a little bit      

452
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:41,833
so it's not completely          
     broken down,               

453
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,233
but got those flavors           
     combining.                 

454
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:45,169
Then the lime juice,            
a little bit of orange juice,   

455
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:46,703
     fish sauce,                
   and the sugar.               

456
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,838
     This is the counterbalance?

457
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:49,840
It balances out sour            
     and salty.                 

458
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:51,042
Finally, the cilantro.          

459
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:53,244
So this has all the Thai --     
hot, sour, salty, sweet.        

460
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,579
                  Whoo! Oh!     

461
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:55,913
  Now it's gonna go             
    on the grill.               

462
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:56,980
           Regular old charcoal?

463
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:58,649
Natural hardwood charcoal.      

464
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:01,052
       Okay. What do you do when
       it rains heavy out here? 

465
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:02,453
        Uh...                   
                    Get wet?    

466
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,455
  We just get wet.              
  It's Oregon, man.             
               How we looking?  

467
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,123
We should be around medium,     
    medium-rare there.          

468
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,325
Pull that off. Then we're       
just gonna slice it up,         

469
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,528
pile it on the plate, and we're 
gonna hit it with the sauce.    

470
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:11,996
A little bit of cilantro        
         for it.                

471
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:13,998
     And then we got            
the iced mustard greens.        

472
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,133
You take a little sticky rice,  
and then you can use that       

473
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,802
to pick up some of the meat     
       and the sauce            

474
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:19,737
    and pop that                
   in your mouth.               
                        Mmm!    

475
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:22,073
And just take a little iced     
crispy yu choy to eat with it.  

476
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,674
      This is ridiculously good.

477
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,676
               Crunchy, spicy,  
                sugar, salty.   

478
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:27,010
    Northern Thai               
   drinking food.               

479
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:28,745
              Looks good, huh,  
               hungry camera?   

480
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:30,281
                    Nope.       

481
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,083
     [ Laughs ]                 

482
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,784
                 Not today.     

483
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,086
    It's really, really good.   

484
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:36,220
             Boar in the window.

485
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:38,022
               Salty, spicy --  
                 just right.    

486
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:39,357
    Coming up with the boar.    

487
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:42,092
Super authentic, nothing that   
you would just find anywhere.   

488
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:43,961
Cha ca is in your window.       
      Here's satay.             

489
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:46,631
     It's O.G. It's awesome.    
   O.T. -- original Thailand.   

490
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:48,232
             FIERI:             
   Right down to the hardware.  

491
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:51,034
    This is a coconut milk press
         that I brought back    
           from Thailand.       

492
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,637
           We're putting in     
       the fresh grated coconut,

493
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:54,038
      mixing it with warm water.

494
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,574
There's a filter, and it presses
           out the coconut milk.

495
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:59,710
    All for only one dish --    
     the coconut curry soup.    

496
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:01,779
  Khao soi.                     
     MAN: Totally authentic.    

497
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:03,781
   That's the way we had it in  
 the northern part of Thailand. 

498
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:04,982
          Khao soi is coming up.

499
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,984
          We also like          
     the kung op wun sen --     

500
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:08,252
 the pork belly and the prawns. 

501
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:09,587
Oh, he's going right            
 for the pork belly.            

502
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,456
          Well, I mean, come on.

503
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:14,192
             That's crazy!      
      Flavor is just so intense.

504
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:16,460
                  But not spicy.
Not all Thai food is spicy.     

505
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:17,928
               Excellent dish.  
                 Thank you.     

506
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:19,130
     Thank you.                 
                     Everything.

507
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:20,464
  Got three kung op             
    ready to go.                

508
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:21,732
  Food's definitely delicious.  

509
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,000
Cuttlefish coming in.           

510
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:24,535
      It was worth the wait     
     to get in here tonight.    

511
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,871
McGinnis?                       
  FIERI: Or you could just head 
    for the take-out window.    

512
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,206
                Hi, there.      
  Hi, guys.                     

513
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,740
  We started with just this menu
        that's right here.      

514
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:31,676
  That was it?                  
       A handful of items.      

515
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:33,077
       The papaya pok pok.      

516
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,613
    FIERI: Including the one    
    this joint's named after.   

517
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:37,414
             Green papaya salad,
             or papaya pok pok. 

518
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:40,017
     Pok pok is an onomatopoeia,
     it's this noise right here.

519
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:42,286
  Start out with a little bit of
    garlic, a couple of chilies.

520
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:43,688
            You like it spicy?  
I'll take it spicy.             

521
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:44,821
                We'll make it   
               three chilies.   

522
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:46,290
               Nice big scoop   
               of palm sugar,   

523
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,092
           and we're gonna start
             pounding that down.

524
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:49,693
That's pok pok. Okay.           
              That's pok pok.   

525
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:52,697
           Next, the fresh limes
        with the skin and juice.

526
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,565
     Garlic, lime,              
and chili mojito going.         

527
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,567
          That's pretty much it.
               Fried shrimp.    

528
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,502
  And then I'm gonna follow that
           with some long beans.

529
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:01,105
All right, then some lime juice.
      The ubiquitous fish sauce.

530
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,506
     And this is tamarind water.

531
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,241
             Gives a nice sour, 
            fruity flavor to it.

532
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,843
       And now the green papaya.

533
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:07,945
This is all grated fresh        
       each time?               
                   Grated fresh.

534
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,913
          Then we're gonna start
  pounding it all together here.

535
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:11,782
       The dressing gets kind of
   pushed into the green papaya,

536
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,584
            but the green papaya
         stays nice and crunchy.

537
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:16,120
Nice handful of cherry tomatoes,
           and add some peanuts.

538
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:17,588
   And each time,               
this is the routine?            

539
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:18,723
        This is the way we do it
               every time.      

540
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:20,724
Man, someone's got to be        
working hard at this job.       

541
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,059
   The next thing we're gonna do
          is plate it up.       

542
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:23,794
    And then you got to eat this
          with sticky rice.     

543
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,263
      Mmm! Wow.                 

544
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:28,132
You get all the flavors,        
the crunch, the presentation.   

545
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:30,134
 Everybody's playing nice-nice. 
 There's no lead guitar in this.

546
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:32,470
          This embodies the idea
      of hot, sour, salty, sweet

547
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:34,138
        more than anything else.

548
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:35,606
        Mmm!                    
   Awesome, dude.               

549
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:36,741
  Really, awesome.              

550
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:39,610
    It's a really great blend   
       of spicy and sour.       

551
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:41,545
       It's really tangy.       
             Papaya pok pok.    

552
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:43,814
         This is one of         
       my favorite dishes.      
     It's really exquisite.     

553
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,015
This is khao soi gai.           

554
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:46,684
           Everything           
    is so uniquely different.   

555
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,220
                   Whole bird.  
          It's not just         
        from one region.        

556
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:50,754
     FIERI: Or one country.     
                        Wings!  

557
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,691
  The biggest hit on this menu  
         is Vietnamese.         

558
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:55,826
    Vietnamese chicken wings.   
                 Spicy wings up.

559
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:57,761
        My friends and I        
   like to call it meat candy.  

560
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,429
              Ain't not a thing 
             but a chicken wing.
That's right.                   

561
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:01,265
We've got some chopped garlic,  
          some salt.            

562
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:02,433
   Kind of massage              
   that together,               

563
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:03,700
 pulling the liquid             
 out of the garlic.             

564
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:05,903
Add some water to it.           
We're gonna use a cheese cloth. 

565
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:07,638
 Pour that in there             
   and squeeze it.              

566
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,172
And that will flavor            
      the wings                 

567
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,774
without putting garlic          
     on the wings.              

568
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,176
         Because it will burn --
It will burn when you fry it.   

569
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,645
       To this,                 
we're gonna add sugar.          

570
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,113
                   Super fine.  
And fish sauce.                 

571
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:18,249
And then we're gonna go ahead   
      and mix that all,         

572
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,851
and then we're just gonna       
throw that marinade             
on the chicken wings.           

573
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,186
    We'll give it               
 a darn good mixing.            

574
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:23,588
              You got not just  
             a marination going,

575
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,456
                 you got        
         a little osmosis going.
We got a bring going.           

576
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:26,991
                  How long      
            will these marinate?
    Overnight.                  

577
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,125
                 And then       
             we deep-fry them.  
  Yeah.                         

578
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:29,827
And then we're gonna toss it    
in the wing caramel,            

579
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:31,329
which is fish sauce,            

580
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:33,130
  some good, clean              
  Oregon tap water,             

581
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:34,498
  and a whole bunch             
      of sugar.                 

582
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,466
    Real simple.                

583
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,001
                 All right,     
              that's all mixed. 

584
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,669
       Now, wings, drained them,
              dried them.       

585
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,871
    Now we're gonna mix         
the wing dust, we call it.      

586
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,606
   Plain old Thai               
 jasmine rice flour.            

587
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:45,876
     Rice flour is so super fine
 that it doesn't clump up on it.

588
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:47,544
      And then                  
 we got tempura mix.            

589
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:50,081
We're gonna get some wings in   
there and mix that all together.

590
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,749
         It's just funny, 'cause
         I'm not typically a fan

591
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:53,150
             of a dredged wing, 

592
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:56,220
             but since it's such
      a fine flour, I'll try it.

593
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:58,155
And then we're gonna drop it    
right in the deep fryer,        

594
00:20:58,191 --> 00:21:00,491
   and we're gonna start heating
 that caramel base we just made.

595
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:02,360
      When it starts bubbling --
          You want it spicy?    

596
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:03,627
Yeah, throw a little heat       
         on it.                 

597
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:05,029
        Some of this chili paste
                  here.         

598
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:07,498
       That's gonna give it that
       nice toasty spice flavor.

599
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:08,766
         I pull those wings out.

600
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,034
             Just gonna toss it 
               right in there.  

601
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:11,502
        And we're gonna throw in
            our fried garlic.   

602
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,437
Wow, you can see that candy     
      right on there.           

603
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:15,439
             We're just gonna do
          a little trick here --

604
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,174
              shvitz it with    
          just a touch of water.

605
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:20,644
 It pulls the stuff off the side
     of the pan in a nice glaze.

606
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:21,912
We'll let those cool            
    a little bit.               

607
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,981
Cool lettuce to go with         
the hot spicy wings.            

608
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:25,516
             Hot and spicy --   
          did you get that part?

609
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,318
Pickled daikon and cucumbers,   
          carrots.              

610
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:28,652
      Cilantro                  
to crunch up with it.

612

It's seriously some of the stuff
      I love more than anything.

886
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:32,756
Rub everything inside           
really, really well.            

887
00:31:32,758 --> 00:31:34,624
  Put this in here.             
   Let it ferment.              

888
00:31:34,627 --> 00:31:36,626
    And how long does the kimchi
              ferment?          
 A day.                         

889
00:31:36,629 --> 00:31:37,961
               All right,       
         what are we gonna make?

890
00:31:37,963 --> 00:31:39,229
Korean spicy pork sauce.        

891
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:41,031
   Chopped onions,              
   chopped ginger.              

892
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:42,198
       Garlic.                  

893
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,033
Put a little water in there.    
            Kiwi.               

894
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,103
         That little bit of kiwi
           makes a difference?  
  Yes.                          

895
00:31:46,105 --> 00:31:49,306
       He put in his much garlic
           and this much ginger,

896
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,308
                 this much kiwi.
      And then                  
we're gonna blend it.           

897
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:52,509
 This will break it             
  all the way down.             

898
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:53,576
                  Really?       
    Yeah.                       

899
00:31:53,646 --> 00:31:54,845
And then we're gonna put        
all this stuff in there.        

900
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,047
  Sugar, soy sauce,             
 Korean bean paste.             

901
00:31:57,116 --> 00:31:59,182
             I got to try this. 

902
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:01,051
               That's awesome!  

903
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,853
   A little sweet,              
     spicy miso.                

904
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:05,055
                 Like Korean    
               peanut butter.   

905
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:07,724
Korean red pepper flakes.       

906
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:09,526
                 Is that hot?   
It's very hot.                  

907
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:10,927
                   Okay.        
     Okay.                      

908
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:12,596
And then we mix it again.       

909
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:14,197
           This is what the pork
            gets marinated in?  

910
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:15,365
      Exactly.                  

911
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,133
              That is awesome.  
             Now what do we do? 

912
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:19,136
  We're gonna take              
   the pork butt.               
      The regular old pork butt.

913
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,071
       Slice it thin.           
Now we take our sliced pork.    

914
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,605
                         Got it.
We get that marinated.          

915
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:24,341
            It's gonna soak up  
               the marinade.    
  Uh-huh.                       

916
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:25,808
             Which, the marinade
                is the bomb.    

917
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:27,744
               And how long     
             will it marinate?  
For at least a day.             

918
00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:29,546
                   Fire it up.  
So we got the spicy pork.       

919
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:32,682
Let's hear a little bit.        
A little caramelization         
on the outside. Yeah.           

920
00:32:32,685 --> 00:32:34,083
         Put a little sesame oil
                on there.       
   Got it.                      

921
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,086
           Kimchi, chopped it up
        and mix it all in there.

922
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:38,021
     All the flavors coming out.
So good.                        

923
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:40,623
     Jasmine rice. This is sauce
     we made to flavor the rice.

924
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:42,759
A lot of work for a burrito,    
            bro.                
                        Exactly.

925
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:45,095
             And then scallions.
        Give it some nice color.

926
00:32:45,097 --> 00:32:47,164
        Take the tortilla shell,
    get that nice and heated up.

927
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,232
             The whole mixture  
               right there.     
Look at this.                   

928
00:32:49,234 --> 00:32:50,233
 Mung beans.                    
                   Love 'em.    

929
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:52,302
Julienned cucumbers.            
A little bit of hot sauce.      

930
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:53,570
     Sour cream.                

931
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:54,771
              This I don't get. 

932
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:56,239
      And then                  
a little bit of nori.           

933
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:58,241
      This is the oddest burrito
            I've ever seen.     

934
00:32:58,377 --> 00:33:00,376
We roll that up right there.    
      Parchment paper.          

935
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:02,179
          I'll eat right through
            the parchment paper.

936
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:04,113
And then we wrap it in foil     
to keep it nice and hot.        

937
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:06,216
                Look at that!   

938
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,052
                    Mmm!        

939
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:10,453
           That's out of bounds!

940
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:13,189
 The kimchi's a little bit sour,
          a bit spicy.          

941
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:14,991
  The meat's got tons of flavor,
          a little chew.        

942
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:16,726
       And the mung bean -- mmm!

943
00:33:16,729 --> 00:33:18,595
         Dude, that is seriously
                the bomb.       

944
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:20,597
                   Nice job.    
                Rocked it out.  
 Thanks, bro.                   

945
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:21,865
          BANKS:                
Spicy pork kimchee burrito.     

946
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,400
           The kimchi           
      really comes through.     

947
00:33:23,469 --> 00:33:25,202
           It's spicy,          
   and there's a little tang.   

948
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,604
Here you go.                    
  A little zing, a little zang. 

949
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,940
        It is delicious.        
               It's really good.

950
00:33:29,942 --> 00:33:31,408
              Spicy pork tacos! 

951
00:33:31,477 --> 00:33:33,543
       Every single plate       
          is delicious.         

952
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:35,679
                    Sloppy Jojo.
   And you get a huge portion.  

953
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:37,547
       FIERI: From Chinese      
     yellow curry chicken...    

954
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:39,015
      It's nice and creamy.     

955
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:40,283
             FIERI:             
  ...to Korean beef short ribs. 

956
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:41,684
         Up in 30 seconds, okay?

957
00:33:41,754 --> 00:33:43,953
          And check out         
    the pork chop value meal.   

958
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:45,888
    Sweet chili fried pork chops
             right here.        

959
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:48,091
         Two pork chops         
  with a mound of French fries. 

960
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:49,358
                This is just    
               something else.  

961
00:33:49,395 --> 00:33:51,027
  They've got the perfect sauce 
             for it.            

962
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,095
       It's really tasty.       

963
00:33:52,097 --> 00:33:53,229
  We're gonna make              
    the marinade                

964
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:55,098
for the sweet chili fried       
       pork chops.              

965
00:33:55,134 --> 00:33:57,100
                         Got it.
The ginger, onions, garlic.     

966
00:33:57,136 --> 00:33:58,568
  And then --                   
                  Of course...  

967
00:33:58,604 --> 00:34:00,036
A little bit of kiwi.           
          A little bit of water.

968
00:34:00,072 --> 00:34:01,637
       Mm-hmm.                  

969
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:03,106
          Oh, it smells awesome.

970
00:34:03,142 --> 00:34:05,442
Add some soy sauce, sugar.      
          Whisk.                

971
00:34:05,444 --> 00:34:07,577
We'll take the pork chops,      
marinade all over it.           

972
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:09,579
     This is the super marinade.
            I can just smell it.

973
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:11,514
        This is my kind of food.
And how long will this marinate?

974
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,382
 Another day.                   
         Now what are we making?

975
00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:15,118
We're gonna make the finishing  
sauce for the marinade.         

976
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:16,920
Put a little honey in there.    
       White vinegar.           

977
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:18,788
Sesame oil in there.            
    Sesame seeds.               

978
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:20,257
 We're deep-frying              
  the pork chops.               
           After we deep fry it,

979
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:22,058
        this is the sauce that's
         gonna get put on there?

980
00:34:22,094 --> 00:34:23,726
         Exactly.               
The pork chop's marinated.      

981
00:34:23,796 --> 00:34:25,662
  We'll dust it with            
just simple corn starch         

982
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:27,330
and all-purpose flour.          

983
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,132
So you get that extra           
   little crunch.               
         This goes in the fryer.

984
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:31,067
  As it is?                     
        Nice and golden brown.  

985
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,535
              Take that sauce,  
            pour it all over it.

986
00:34:32,604 --> 00:34:34,003
We're still cooking this?       

987
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:35,672
     And then we're gonna put it
         on the flat grill oven.

988
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:37,007
              And a little bit  
                 more sauce.    

989
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:38,341

                      Of course.

992

997
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,089

998
