1
00:00:01,102 --> 00:00:02,167
Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,635
I'm Guy Fieri,
  and we're rolling out

3
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:06,638
looking for America's greatest
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,640
This trip...

5
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:11,510
...we're catching some rays
 and grabbing some grub...

6
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,545
Ding!
 ...all across America...

7
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:15,414
I'm just gonna hold on,
   'cause this looks like

8
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:16,615
it's gonna be a rough ride.

9
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:18,317
...from a Hawaiian
   shrimp truck...

10
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:19,485
You'll love this place.

11
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:21,453
...to an Outer Bank
   seafood stop...

12
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:22,554
Enjoy the local fare.

13
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:24,723
...to a landmark
  Florida fish house...

14
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,425
It's like a piece of history.

15
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:28,127
...plus sushi in Mexico...

16
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:28,994
Really?

17
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:30,729
...Pakistani in Arizona...

18
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:32,131
Ah, I can't stop.

19
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:33,165
...and in Cali...

20
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:34,266
Bring the kids down!

21
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:36,869
...classic 'cue
 and one funky food truck.

22
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:37,536
Wow!

23
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,138
So grab some SPF,

24
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,939
relax, and dig in.

25
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:42,641
This is out of bounds.

26
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:44,643
That's all right here,
   right now,

27
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:47,579
on "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives."

28
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:05,030
Ladies and gentlemen,
 in case you haven't noticed,

29
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:07,266
the food truck invasion
   has happened.

30
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:09,601
I mean, we're seeing them
  everywhere -- Texas,

31
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:11,837
Los Angeles,
  Vancouver, you name it.

32
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:14,440
And now here
  on the Island of Oahu

33
00:01:14,442 --> 00:01:15,674
in the North Shore,

34
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:17,943
this is the Big Wave Shrimp
    truck.

35
00:01:20,815 --> 00:01:22,915
You can't go wrong
eating at Big Wave Shrimp.

36
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:24,349
Yeah, absolutely perfect.

37
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:26,185
Everyone's favorite place
    on Oahu to eat.

38
00:01:26,187 --> 00:01:28,787
Which started when Mike Stacey
  gave his wife, Kate,

39
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:31,290
something she's always wanted --
  her own restaurant.

40
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:32,991
So it used to be
    a handyman bus.

41
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:34,726
And you took it and converted
it into a restaurant?

42
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:35,394
Yes.

43
00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:36,195
On wheels.

44
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:38,097
Spicy shrimp.

45
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:41,400
And started cranking out their
 take on North Shore staples.

46
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:43,535
So local style
 is Hawaiian style,

47
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:45,137
but you put your
 Thai flair to it?

48
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:46,205
Correct.

49
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:47,172
So, what kind of food
 do you make here?

50
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:48,340
The main thing is the shrimp.

51
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:49,875
So all kind of shrimp here
on the shrimp truck?

52
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:51,443
Lemon peppered shrimp.

53
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,678
I already know what you want --

54
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,179
Coconut Shrimp.

55
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:55,747
I'm having the crunchy shrimp.

56
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:57,683
I mean, I like it.
   It's tasty.

57
00:01:57,685 --> 00:01:59,218
We're gonna miss the batter.

58
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,919
For the crunchy shrimp?

59
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:02,454
Yes, sir.

60
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,122
Tempura.

61
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:04,056
Tempura batter.

62
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:04,723
Sugar.

63
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:05,457
Sugar!

64
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,060
So, that's a 21, 25 shrimp,

65
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:10,362
butterflied all
the way open, no shell.

66
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:11,597
Okay, so we dip them
 in the batter.

67
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,364
Yes.

68
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:13,298
Into the panko.
      Panko.

69
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,967
Let that kind of stick
  on there.

70
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,602
Vegetable oil.

71
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:18,770
Now we are ready
    to put in the pan.

72
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:23,041
Every time somebody orders
something, make it to scratch?

73
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:24,076
Yes, every time.

74
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:29,481
And we cook fast.

75
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,783
After we finish,
   we put on the plate.

76
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:34,520
10 pieces.

77
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:36,288
Sweet and sour,
 or sweet chili?

78
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,890
Sweet chili.

79
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:39,224
Mmm.

80
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:41,660
There's something about
getting shrimp on the island

81
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:45,397
when they're not frozen,
  so tender.

82
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:47,432
You can't beat it.

83
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:51,003
Crazy, but great!

84
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:54,673
- Crunchy shrimp!
- It's just insane, it's so good.

85
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,809
As soon as it hits your mouth,
 it's just, like, mmm, melts.

86
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:00,279
I'm a junkie --
    shrimp junkie.

87
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:01,513
But you make other things.

88
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,283
From shoyu chicken
 and locally-grown sweet corn

89
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:06,585
to Kate's Korean-style
   short ribs.

90
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:08,320
These are just, like,
  perfect.

91
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:09,588
Barbecue short ribs
     for you.

92
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,789
Barbecue short ribs
  for me?

93
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,257
Yes.
   I'm just gonna hold on,

94
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,326
'cause this looks like
  it's gonna be a rough ride.

95
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:17,029
Okay, I'm sorry.

96
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:19,031
I start to cut
    the short ribs.

97
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:20,065
Then you season?

98
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:21,967
This is a chicken broth
     seasoning.

99
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,802
Chicken base and a little bit
 of garlic salt?

100
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,070
Correct.

101
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:26,371
This sits here with the dry rub
 on it for how long?

102
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,439
It's about one or two hours.

103
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:28,507
And then we're gonna
 cook it in the pan?

104
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:29,174
Mm-hmm.

105
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:29,841
A little oil.

106
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,243
This is a thin slice,

107
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:33,645
which is more of the Asian
 or Korean style.

108
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:35,480
Just because of the bone
and the connective tissue,

109
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:38,116
it's almost sweet,
real great meat flavor.

110
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:39,885
And that's just it.
Nice and simple, huh?

111
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,587
Chicken base
 and garlic salt.

112
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,800
Next seasoning,
     Hondashi.

113
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:56,001
An Asian seasoned salt.

114
00:03:56,003 --> 00:03:57,869
And then one the rice,
     furikake.

115
00:03:57,871 --> 00:04:04,977
Furikake is a traditional
Hawaiian-Asian seasoned salt.

116
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:06,511
I love it!

117
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:09,615
Look at that,
 nice and crispy.

118
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:12,451
Anything I can eat with
my hands, of course, I want to.

119
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:14,853
But short rib just by itself,
it's got great flavor.

120
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,822
Get a little bit of the rice
 with the furikake.

121
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:21,727
- Put a bite of that...
- with this.

122
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:24,129
What's not to like
  about this?

123
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,064
Barbecued short ribs!

124
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:29,234
They're really juicy,
and they're not overcooked.

125
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:30,469
The ribs are really good.

126
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:31,970
There's a lot of different
   flavor to it.

127
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:35,107
And everything that they make
   is handmade, real deal.

128
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:36,074
Everything.

129
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,876
Make all these people happy,

130
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:39,177
you should be, like,
the Mayor or something.

131
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:42,114
Thank you so much.
You'll love this place.

132
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:47,085
So now, we're headed
 to sunny Cabo San Lucas.

133
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,321
I'm here to check out a joint
 that my buddy Gorilla --

134
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:52,190
You remember Gorilla Rich from
 Gorilla Barbecue in Pacifica?

135
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,326
He says he's been to this place
  a bunch of times.

136
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:55,327
It's off the hook.

137
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:58,030
This is Tiki Bar.

138
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:02,134
Fresh tacos ready.

139
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:05,070
This is our local spot
     to come to.

140
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:06,705
It's in kind of
 a touristy area.

141
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:08,373
Locals and tourists,
  we mix and mingle well.

142
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:13,011
It's right here on the marina.
 I love their food, everything.

143
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,547
Just the kind of place
  owner Moises Gonzales

144
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:19,851
was looking for after
 he became a local in 2005.

145
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,820
A place where people could
   come in, hang out --

146
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,189
I couldn't find a place
    like home in Cali.

147
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,424
Really?

148
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:27,259
And to make it feel more
 like home for the locals,

149
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:29,061
Chef Manuel Aradando

150
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:32,597
is taking advantage
  of the surroundings.

151
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:35,767
I know it's fresh 'cause if I
didn't catch it, my friends did.

152
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:38,036
So, fresh fish all the time,
     every day.

153
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:38,770
Every day.

154
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:41,106
Sushi's excellent here.

155
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:44,443
That's right --
 sushi in a Mexican joint.

156
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:46,078
It's fresh.
  You can't fake that.

157
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,680
From the classic rolls
 like the rainbow and spider

158
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,849
to the turducken of sushi...

159
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,184
Ebi Nagasaki.

160
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:55,887
...layers of fresh fish
inside a butterflied shrimp roll

161
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,123
drizzled with
  homemade eel sauce.

162
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,591
You see it every day.

163
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:02,327
This that we're gonna prepare
today is the ebi Nagasaki.

164
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:05,063
So, what we're gonna do is
start with this surimi salad.

165
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:06,565
And this is imitation crab.

166
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:07,899
Imitation crab.

167
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:09,668
So, we're gonna add
a little bit of mayonnaise,

168
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,236
the masago, that is the...

169
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:11,937
Fish eggs.

170
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:12,904
...fish eggs.

171
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:13,872
And the togarashi...
     Togarashi.

172
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,107
...the Japanese peppers

173
00:06:15,109 --> 00:06:16,708
with a little bit
of sesame seeds and orange zest.

174
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,745
Orange zest, and last
  but not least, sriracha.

175
00:06:19,747 --> 00:06:23,215
So, then what we're gonna do is
just mix it up a little bit.

176
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,417
Want to try it?

177
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:26,918
I like where that starts.

178
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,487
I mean, I don't know why you've
 got to do anything else to it.

179
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:30,088
It just tastes great.

180
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,591
We're gonna take
our Pacific blue shrimp.

181
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:34,292
We are gonna butterfly it.

182
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:34,993
Okay.

183
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:35,727
And then, we do one more.

184
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,196
So once and then twice.

185
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:39,331
That's correct.

186
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,767
Then we're gonna go ahead
 and do our salad.

187
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:44,336
Okay.

188
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:49,207
Next, we're gonna do
 a piece of salmon.

189
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:52,210
This guy's a surgeon!

190
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:54,379
There. So, we do...

191
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:56,615
There we go.

192
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:58,283
That this. Here we are.

193
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,051
Okay.

194
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:01,720
Then, we fold it

195
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:04,156
and we wrap it in the nori,
 in the seaweed.

196
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:05,757
I'm picking up what
    you're laying down.

197
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,125
These are beautiful.

198
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:10,829
Then we have tempura
and then bread crumbs.

199
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:15,801
Fold it in tempura like this,
 and then the bread.

200
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,674
All good to go.
      Okay.

201
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:24,743
So, next thing,
 we're gonna fry it.

202
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:34,553
And we're gonna serve it
    with eel sauce.

203
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,260
A little rose, very nice.

204
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:47,399
Wasabi and mango sauce,
and then more eel sauce.

205
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:49,468
Finish it off with a little
bit of sesame seeds,

206
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,370
and we'll add some
 microgreens.

207
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:53,905
Gorgeous plate.

208
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:57,442
Okay.

209
00:07:57,444 --> 00:08:00,078
The way you treat the shrimp
    and the tenderness

210
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,914
of that shrimp
    is outrageous.

211
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,249
Outrageous.

212
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:05,484
Although it was fried,
    it doesn't have

213
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:06,718
a real heavy
    fried taste to it.

214
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,920
It's very light.

215
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:12,457
The salad has just
    enough of the...

216
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:13,592
sriracha,

217
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:14,860
a little hint
    of the salmon.

218
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:15,961
This is outstanding.

219
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:17,062
Thank you.

220
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:19,331
Mmm.

221
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,533
Ebi Nagasaki up.

222
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:24,636
Super crispy
and really delicious.

223
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:26,771
We're at the Southern tip
  of the Baha Peninsula,

224
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:29,374
where the fishing is
 the greatest in the world.

225
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:32,177
So it's the freshest
  in town.

226
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:36,548
I love this restaurant.
  I come here every day,

227
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,283
ever since he's had it.

228
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:40,318
Just bring people here.
It's a wonderful spot.

229
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,319
I'm just like you guys.

230
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:42,320
You know, you go somewhere,
 you're like,

231
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:43,255
"Where should I go eat?"

232
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:44,689
A funky little place, small,

233
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,391
and these guys
 do it legit.

234
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:48,627
We gotta do more sushi
    on "Triple D."

235
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:53,498
Up next, a killer
  culinary cruiser...

236
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,699
A lot going on in there!

237
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,535
...bringing a taste
   of Singapore

238
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:58,036
right into Orange County.

239
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:58,770
You're the bomb-dot-com.

240
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,513
You been here before?

241
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:09,681
I hear it's the bomb.

242
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:12,150
It's a Singapore concept.

243
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:14,853
And they're never in the same
 location for lunch or dinner.

244
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:16,755
They're from Orange County,
     California.

245
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:18,557
This is Chomp Chomp Nation.

246
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,494
Yeah, it'll be me and the
  millions of people with me.

247
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,599
All day two steaks,
tofu, bean, and lamb.

248
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:28,567
Got some fun, unique food.

249
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:31,136
Singapore tofu burger,
  please.

250
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:33,672
How do you describe to people
  what Singaporean food is?

251
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:36,274
It's exotic,
  tropical Chinese food.

252
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:39,010
Brought to America
 by the husband and wife team

253
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:41,913
of Robert Zuetell
  and Gina Galvan.

254
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,248
We call it quick gourmet.

255
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,318
Quick gourmet.

256
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,654
It comes out in three minutes,
looks like a million dollars.

257
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:51,856
Not that you couldn't tell,
  Robert's background

258
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:53,525
is in restaurant PR.

259
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:56,328
And Gina, I mean, she's just
  traveled the world

260
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,896
as a food technologist.

261
00:09:57,898 --> 00:09:59,898
I worked for all kinds
   of restaurant chains

262
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,066
and food manufacturers.

263
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:04,002
To develop food concepts
 and food recipes?

264
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:06,237
And she's picked up flavors
 that are turning the truck

265
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,639
into a spice market

266
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:11,276
with an outrageous blend
 mixed into this top seller.

267
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:12,344
Crab cake.

268
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:14,579
A delicious lunch
  for a good price.

269
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:18,917
When I went to Singapore,

270
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:21,186
I figured out this is what
   Singapore tastes like.

271
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:23,521
And that's why I call this,
   the aromatics package.

272
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:24,789
So, the key ingredients --
  ginger...

273
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:28,093
Ginger, lemongrass,
    shallots, galangal.

274
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:30,729
Galangal, a relative
 of the ginger.

275
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:33,665
Yes.
   Garlic, Thai chilies,

276
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:36,034
and finally,
   the kaffir lime leaf.

277
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,536
Now, the kaffir lime leaf,
there's just such an intensity

278
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:39,871
and such a richness...

279
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:42,674
and such an amazing,
 aromatic flavor

280
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:47,045
and essence that comes
 from it. Okay.

281
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:48,546
You're just gonna make
 this into a paste?

282
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:51,049
Kind of a rough paste.

283
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:53,652
All right.
    There it be.

284
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,453
Awesome.

285
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:56,554
So, what are we
gonna make with this?

286
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:58,023
We're gonna make
    crab cake sandwich.

287
00:10:58,025 --> 00:10:59,958
Andale!

288
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,625
What is this?

289
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:02,460
This is rice cake.

290
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:03,928
Cook it in this plastic,

291
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,364
and it compresses
   the rice as it cooks.

292
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:08,767
And in Singapore,
   it's called ketupat.

293
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:12,537
It tastes like you
cooked a bunch of rice

294
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:14,706
a little overcooked,
and then compressed it.

295
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,775
Mm-hmm. The reason I put
   this in the crab cake

296
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:20,779
is because it makes the crab
   stand up nice and firm.

297
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:23,948
The aromatics packet.

298
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:28,119
Sri Lanken blue crab
    leg and claw.

299
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:31,122
Chili crab sauce.

300
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,760
I like that.

301
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:38,329
Sweet chili sauce,
    mayonnaise, panko.

302
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:39,597
Panko bread crumbs.

303
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:40,298
Egg.

304
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,133
This is looking good.

305
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:44,102
What is that over there?

306
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,572
Caught you!

307
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:49,708
Can you get me that, please,
    which is the panko?

308
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,911
We're gonna make it
 a little crispy on the outside.

309
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:54,479
That's a good-looking
  crab cake.

310
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:56,581
Okay. Now, we're gonna
   walk over to the fryer.

311
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:57,949
Everything's cooked in there.

312
00:11:57,951 --> 00:12:00,385
So, you're just frying it
enough to put a crisp on it.

313
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,053
Yep.

314
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,188
What are we gonna make?

315
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,757
Our lemongrass
  kaffir lime vinaigrette.

316
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,627
Grape-seed oil, rice vinegar,
    our aromatics,

317
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:11,329
kaffir lime leaf,
    whole thing.

318
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:13,965
Shallots,
   country Dijon mustard.

319
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:14,766
In an emulsifier?

320
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:15,767
You're pretty smart, there.

321
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:19,270
Chinese white pepper,
    lychee juice.

322
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:20,371
Lychee juice!

323
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:22,173
It's tropical and exotic.

324
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:25,009
Sweet chili sauce
    and cilantro.

325
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:30,148
Oh, yeah.

326
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,915
Yes!

327
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,050
Mmm.

328
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:33,518
Now we're making the slaw.

329
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,419
The slaw.

330
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,655
Green cabbage
    and red cabbage.

331
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:38,723
Carrots, here we go.

332
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:39,524
Daikon.

333
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:40,792
Ooh, I like the daikon.

334
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,393
Cucumber, mango.

335
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:43,128
Oh, mango!

336
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,430
Red onion, green apple.

337
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:46,097
Really?

338
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,332
Mm-hmm.

339
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:49,968
And then, we'll serve the slaw
dressing on it to order?

340
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,102
Yes.

341
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,271
Now, we're gonna
   plate up our crab cake.

342
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,205
Spicy ketchup.

343
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:54,873
Chili crab sauce.

344
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:55,540
Mm-hmm.

345
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:56,674
The slaw.

346
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:58,009
This is not gonna suck.

347
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,250
I'm telling you what.

348
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:07,185
That's tasty.

349
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:10,588
You've got tangy,
sweet, crunchy, salty.

350
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,423
This is
a really nice balance.

351
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:16,728
And the kicker to the whole
 thing is that slaw.

352
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,495
Yay.

353
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:21,099
That's ridiculous.

354
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:22,066
Awesome job.

355
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:22,901
Thank you.

356
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:24,469
Wow!

357
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:25,970
Crab cake!

358
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,907
This thing tastes like
a really expensive crab cake.

359
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,241
It's delicious.

360
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:33,244
And there's more deliciousness
  where that came from.

361
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:35,647
The only challenge
   is pinning down

362
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:38,349
this nine-ton
  tiger-striped behemoth.

363
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:39,584
Find out wherever they are,

364
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:41,920
and have the best
 gourmet lunch truck around.

365
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:43,588
So they make it easy
   with a combo

366
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,891
of new-school social media
 and old-school technique

367
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,827
picked up from the
   ice cream man.

368
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,597
That's the Chomp Chomp growl.

369
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:55,066
You hit that horn and you pull
  up to an apartment complex,

370
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:56,701
people don't have to cook.

371
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:59,971
They can come out and get great,
   fresh Singaporean food.

372
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:01,039
Yes.

373
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,340
Like this gourmet sandwich...

374
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,708
Lamb burger!

375
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,644
...inspired by the Little India
  section of Singapore.

376
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,446
Delicious.

377
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:09,948
Lamb's big in Singapore?

378
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,150
It is.
    So, we have lamb.

379
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:14,485
First is
   the aromatics package.

380
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:16,921
We have mint, parsley.

381
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:18,122
Put some cilantro in there.

382
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:19,357
Dark soy sauce.

383
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,992
Okay.
    Very Singaporean.

384
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:24,896
We've got some Worcestershire
  and tamarind concentrate.

385
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:25,997
Really?

386
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:27,165
So, you've got a sweet
  and a tang.

387
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:29,334
And then our spice,
    mild curry powder.

388
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:30,435
Mild curry...

389
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:31,135
and hot curry.

390
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:31,936
Yep.

391
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:33,304
Chinese white pepper again,

392
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:34,272
kosher salt.

393
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,575
Okay, I've got to stand
    on my tippy-toes.

394
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:38,476
You're gonna fall in.

395
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:39,777
I know.

396
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,512
You gotta do it. Work harder.

397
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:42,914
It's ready to go.

398
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,215
All right.
So, we make the pattie.

399
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,183
How many ounces?

400
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:46,217
We're doing four.

401
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,352
And we flat-top this?

402
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:48,119
Flat-top it.

403
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:48,853
Grill it up on both sides...

404
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:49,754
Mm-hmm.

405
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:50,955
...and make some
 yogurt sauce.

406
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:53,558
Uh-huh. First ingredient
    is Greek yogurt.

407
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,692
Got it.

408
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:59,197
Then we've got parsley,
    cilantro, mint,

409
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,699
lime juice
    freshly squeezed,

410
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,534
and our curry powder,
    mild and the hot.

411
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,436
Mild and the hot.

412
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,605
And the kosher salt.

413
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:09,908
Mmm, smells good.

414
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,708
Can I taste it?

415
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,011
Yes.

416
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:17,715
Wow.

417
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:20,818
There's a lot going on
  in there.

418
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,186
Our cooked lamb's done.

419
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:23,054
Nice.

420
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:24,322
Little bit of sauce.

421
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:25,089
Yogurt sauce.

422
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:25,757
Correct.

423
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:28,092
And edamame sprouts.

424
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,161
There we go.

425
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:38,369
It's the last thing I expected
when I pulled up here.

426
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:41,773
I think Singapore,
I think soy sauce, Asian food,

427
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,108
but I'm a sucker
 for a lamb burger.

428
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,843
The flavors
 are well balanced.

429
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:48,613
I like the spicy curry.

430
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,081
The lamb, the herbs.

431
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,449
And the edamame sprouts,
     I think,

432
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,284
are a different texture.

433
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,352
I love that crunch.

434
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:56,654
The sweetness,
herbaceousness of them.

435
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:57,689
The whole thing's
 a package deal.

436
00:15:57,691 --> 00:15:59,590
I mean, it is
a great lamb burger.

437
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:01,125
You're the bomb-dot-com.

438
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,760
Chomp Chomp Nation.

439
00:16:03,897 --> 00:16:05,363
Really unique flavors.

440
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:07,598
Really melts in
 your mouth, really tender,

441
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,434
lots of great spice.

442
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:10,902
Congratulations.
    Awesome place.

443
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:12,370
Thank you.
   I mean, a funky joint,

444
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:13,838
and you really take
   a lot of appreciation,

445
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,840
a lot of time, a lot of care,
 a lot of energy in your food.

446
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:16,774
Awesome.

447
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,712
Coming up,
  we're still soaking up

448
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:21,946
the California sun...

449
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:22,914
Ohh!

450
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,315
...at an outdoor pit stop...

451
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,650
You wanna become friends
    with this cat.

452
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,485
...smoking up
  a Southern shout-out.

453
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,220
This is real-deal
    barbecue, man.

454
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,262
So, when you're cruising
  down Rosedale Highway

455
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:40,298
going East right through
  the Northwest side

456
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,100
of Bakersfield, California,

457
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:44,168
just slow down and kind of...

458
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,570
hang your head out the window.

459
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:46,938
What's that you smell?

460
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,639
Exactly -- killer barbecue.

461
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:50,575
We're talking
  mesquite-charcoaled,

462
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:53,077
some red oak, cooking up
  in a funky little place

463
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:56,481
called Salty's BBQ & Catering.

464
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:01,019
Half-pound
  pulled pork dinner!

465
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:04,088
I give this place
    a 10 and a half.

466
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,958
It makes me feel like
I'm back in Oklahoma.

467
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,793
Pig sandwich
  and green beans!

468
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:11,796
The traffic's a little noisy,
   but it doesn't

469
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:13,297
take away from the food.

470
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:16,634
Which has been cooked up
  curbside since 2012

471
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:20,138
by chef and owner, Jeff Salters.

472
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,306
You can't have a name
    that cool and get

473
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:23,608
in the barbecue business.

474
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,076
Your last name
    could be "Sauce."

475
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,377
That's the only name
  that would be any better

476
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,946
than having "Salters"
    as your last name.

477
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:30,581
It's really kind of
  entertaining to watch,

478
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,250
knowing that that's
 your chicken right there,

479
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:33,518
or that's your tri-tip.

480
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,819
It's great.

481
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,087
Salty Special!

482
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:37,555
I'm having the Salty Special.

483
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,157
You got
   the best combination.

484
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:40,525
You got tri-tip, pulled pork,

485
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:43,761
and you got the barbecue
    sauce on top of it.

486
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:44,796
What are we making?

487
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:46,130
We're gonna make
 our Salty's rub.

488
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:51,002
We've got lemon pepper,
 some garlic powder,

489
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:53,204
and then we're gonna
 put in allspice.

490
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:54,572
Is there gonna be
   a little seasoned salt?

491
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,507
A little seasoned salt, and then
we just throw a little basil.

492
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:59,177
Looks like an Indian
  spice market right there.

493
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:01,245
All right. So, what are
   we gonna put this on?

494
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,280
We're gonna put this
 on our tri-tip.

495
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:03,815
We like to make
 sure it's covered.

496
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:05,116
We'll leave it on overnight.

497
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:06,818
So, you're setting these up
    for the next day.

498
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,387
We are.

499
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:13,091
Now, we're gonna rub our pork
butts with our Salty's rub.

500
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:16,260
We're gonna put them
in our smoker for 12 hours.

501
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,562
Then, we're gonna lay
 the tri-tip out.

502
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:18,463
Got it.

503
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:20,798
We put it on by hand.

504
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,300
Because by foot
    would be awkward?

505
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:23,601
Very.

506
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,636
So, this will go on
    for about...

507
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:26,571
About 45 minutes.

508
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:28,272
Giddy-up.

509
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:31,209
Barbecue sauce -- What type
 of barbecue sauce are you into?

510
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:33,444
Kind of a sweet,
 smokey, tangy.

511
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,379
Ohh.

512
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:36,981
We're gonna start with
a little ketchup here,

513
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:40,651
brown sugar, hickory smoke,
  soy sauce.

514
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:41,652
Worcestershire?

515
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:43,588
Worcestershire,
apple cider vinegar,

516
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,256
a little bit of H2O,

517
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:47,792
a little bit
 of vegetable oil.

518
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,428
Put our yellow mustard in.

519
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,296
And we put a little bit
of black pepper in there.

520
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:55,366
And this is the standard sauce
   for all the barbecue?

521
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,168
Yes, it is.
    Are we gonna make
   this sandwich or not?

522
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,070
We're gonna get there!
  You're killing me, boss!

523
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:00,805
And when you have it,
it's gonna change your life.

524
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,608
It's gonna change my waistband
  is what it's gonna change.

525
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,043
All right. So, now we're
gonna pull our pork butts out.

526
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:08,179
Okay.

527
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:09,280
Just check this.

528
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:10,648
Look at the bark
    on that bad boy.

529
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,284
Nice smoke ring.

530
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:15,720
Ah, that doesn't suck.

531
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:17,522
Here we go.

532
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:19,223
We're gonna break it down,

533
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:21,459
get it nice and chopped up.

534
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:22,827
Okay, so that's ready.

535
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,897
Now we grab the tri-tip
    and we'll slice it.

536
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:27,665
Time to build it.
     Rock and roll.

537
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,468
So, we're gonna start off
 with laying some tri-tip out,

538
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,770
put a little bit of our
   pulled pork in there,

539
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:35,239
put our barbecue
    sauce on there,

540
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:37,041
put some yellow peppers,

541
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:39,977
top it off with a little bit
    of our coleslaw.

542
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,883
If you order the sandwich,
    does it come with

543
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:48,252
a free beach towel
   or anything like that?

544
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:50,888
Barbecue sauce is spot-on,
    excellent tang,

545
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,356
not too much smoke.

546
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,691
Pulled pork's great.

547
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:56,694
Really get that deep, rich,
 great flavor from the smoke.

548
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,262
It's a really good sauce.

549
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:01,199
Bring the kids down.
  Have a sandwich for four.

550
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:02,833
This is real-deal
    barbecue, man.

551
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:03,701
Nicely done.

552
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:04,735
I like that.
     Nicely done.

553
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:09,473
The barbecue sauce
 just plays off the meat.

554
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:12,043
They nailed it
  with that sandwich.

555
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,711
You wanna find really
 good barbecue,

556
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:14,979
you know what you gotta do?
 You gotta find out

557
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:16,280
where super athletes eat.

558
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:17,648
Number 6, Cody Kessler,

559
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,484
from USC Trojans
and from Bakersfield.

560
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:22,420
When you come back, this is
one of your go-to joints?

561
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:23,754
Yeah. You know,
    living in L.A.,

562
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:25,423
there's a lot
   of great places to eat,

563
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:26,958
but nothing kind
    of this original.

564
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,960
Pork rib dinner,
 green beans, chili beans.

565
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:31,095
Jeff knows what he's doing.

566
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,231
I've been cooking for friends
and family for, like, 20 years.

567
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,265
Barbecue the whole time?

568
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:35,499
Barbecue, yeah.
  Our tag is

569
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:37,668
we're the best of both worlds,
smoking and grilling.

570
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,603
That's smoking.

571
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:40,304
And this is grilling.

572
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:42,640
Half-chicken dinner,
chili beans, potato salad!

573
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:45,243
It's so tender, so moist,
  and you just pick it

574
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:47,411
right off the bone.

575
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:48,346
We're gonna make chicken.

576
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:49,747
Grilled chicken.
     Let's do it.

577
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,116
We take a whole chicken,
 we split them,

578
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:53,517
put a couple slits
in there so the wings

579
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:54,785
will lay flat
when we're grilling it.

580
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:55,686
Okay.

581
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:56,988
Now we're gonna make
 our marinade.

582
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:01,859
We got orange juice,
a little bit of lemon juice.

583
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:03,828
Then we put the chickens
 in the marinade.

584
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,463
Get them nice and covered.

585
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:06,731
So, now we're gonna hit it
    with the dry rub?

586
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:08,633
We're not gonna be shy
about putting it on.

587
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:13,304
You wanna cover it with foil,
let it marinate overnight.

588
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:14,305
Then we'll go to the grill.

589
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:15,940
Absolutely.
      Got it.

590
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:17,441
All right. So, we've
been grilling this chicken

591
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:18,576
about 45 minutes.

592
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:20,478
We're ready to pull it off.
      Hit it!

593
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,880
Good-looking bird.

594
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:23,848
We just tear them by hand.

595
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,050
We serve them in quarters.

596
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:29,854
There's your
half-chicken dinner.

597
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:31,389
That's great bird, man.

598
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:36,193
Tender, good smoke flavor.

599
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:40,097
I like that it just
    falls off the bone.

600
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:43,167
Got a little texture
    in the skin.

601
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:45,469
You killed it, man.
     Nice job.

602
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:49,640
I like the crisp outside pieces,
  so it's got that nice,

603
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,309
like, char on the outside.

604
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,177
The chicken is very tender.

605
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:56,247
Falls off the bone,
  and its smokey flavor --

606
00:21:56,249 --> 00:21:58,349
you taste a little bit
   of mesquite in there.

607
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:00,618
What makes this special
   is Jeff Salty.

608
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,087
Cool thing about this is
    you're not trying

609
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:04,188
to do 10,000 things.

610
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,790
You're able to take it,
     harness it,

611
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:08,259
do it right, and win.

612
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:08,926
Impressive.

613
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:10,294
Thank you very much.

614
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:12,296
You want to become friends
    with this cat.

615
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,401
Coming up on this full
 hour of warm-weather hot spots,

616
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:19,704
a hidden gem
 in Duck, North Carolina...

617
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:21,639
What an awesome joint.
   You got to see this.

618
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:23,207
...serving seafood
   on the plate...

619
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:26,610
It is decadent.
  ...and out the window.

620
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:28,546
<i>Welcome to Cravings.</i>
<i> What can I get for you today?</i>

621
00:22:34,654 --> 00:22:36,687
I'm here in the Outer Banks
  of North Carolina

622
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,189
in a little town called Duck.

623
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:39,824
And I'm here
  for a family reunion.

624
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:41,959
While I'm here, I gotta see
  if there's any hidden

625
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:44,228
"Triple D" joints,
 so I checked this place out.

626
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,031
It's next to a gas station,
 it's got a drive-through,

627
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,666
but don't let those
  things scare you.

628
00:22:48,668 --> 00:22:50,835
They've got a great menu
 and some killer seafood.

629
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:54,171
This is Cravings.

630
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:56,607
It's very fresh.
 It comes right from the water

631
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:58,743
so you know you're getting
 the highest-quality food.

632
00:22:58,745 --> 00:23:00,711
And lobster sauce.

633
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,247
I really don't know a place
 that I can get crab cakes

634
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:06,317
and diesel in the same location.

635
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:08,619
I'd of thought they had
  lost their mind.

636
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:10,688
But owners Dan Lewis
  and Scott Foster

637
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:14,558
knew folks around Duck wouldn't
 judge this book by its cover.

638
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,926
Or a restaurant
    by a gas station?

639
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:18,362
Exactly. We basically
describe it as our version,

640
00:23:18,364 --> 00:23:19,630
our take on quick service.

641
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:21,665
Ordering in, scallop dinner!

642
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:25,369
The scallops is sweet,
 tender, juicy, and just fresh.

643
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:27,872
You can tell the stuff
 just came out of the sea.

644
00:23:27,874 --> 00:23:31,142
So, this is the beginning of
making the lobster brandy sauce.

645
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:31,809
Yes.

646
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:33,844
All right, hit it.

647
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:35,346
I take
   some softened butter.

648
00:23:35,348 --> 00:23:37,815
Gonna go ahead and get
   some garlic in there.

649
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:39,083
Onions go in there.

650
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:41,685
Sweat the onions,
 sweat the garlic.

651
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:42,820
Outer Bank sea salt.

652
00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:44,155
All right.

653
00:23:44,157 --> 00:23:46,757
And I go ahead and hit it
  with a little bit of acid.

654
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,360
Make my roux now,
 about three scoops of flour.

655
00:23:49,362 --> 00:23:50,428
So, 50/50.

656
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,530
So now, I'm gonna hit it
    with some wine.

657
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:57,935
And in goes
    our lobster stock.

658
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,971
And add some heavy cream.
   Then I add the brandy.

659
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:03,874
So, we're gonna let this go,
let it reduce, hold it cold,

660
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:05,543
and then we'll use that
when we make the scallops?

661
00:24:05,545 --> 00:24:06,277
Yep.

662
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:07,244
Got it.

663
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:08,379
Sauce is done.

664
00:24:08,381 --> 00:24:09,613
Yeah.

665
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:12,116
Outer Bank scallops,
  gorgeous-looking scallop.

666
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,317
Word.

667
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:15,920
Little bit of canola
    and vegetable oil.

668
00:24:15,922 --> 00:24:19,190
These guys just
    go right in.

669
00:24:19,192 --> 00:24:20,357
So, now you don't
 mess with them.

670
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,559
You just hit them with...

671
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:22,993
No, you literally don't
    want to touch them.

672
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:24,462
Let them sear
 on both sides.

673
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:26,230
Little bit of that
 Outer Bank salt.

674
00:24:26,232 --> 00:24:27,898
Yep.
Get it seared on one side,

675
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,368
seared on the other side.

676
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,237
All right.
  So, they're almost done.

677
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:35,973
Gonna go ahead
    and land our sauce.

678
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:39,009
Three in the front.

679
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:42,346
Two in the back.

680
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:44,782
I'm gonna put a little dab
 of truffle oil right on top.

681
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,888
Fresh scallop, don't even
need to cut it with a knife.

682
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:56,594
Dude, I'm gonna
 tell you something.

683
00:24:56,596 --> 00:25:01,499
This is up there in some of
the best scallops I've ever had.

684
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:04,668
'Cause this scallop
 is out of bounds.

685
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:08,038
The sauce, the preparation,
the little bit of the crust

686
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,775
on the outside of the scallop,
 super hot pan.

687
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:14,245
The touch
 of the truffle oil.

688
00:25:14,247 --> 00:25:16,747
It is decadent.

689
00:25:18,818 --> 00:25:20,784
I know you wish you could
try some, but I'm so sorry

690
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:25,122
about your allergy
to eating off my plate.

691
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:26,390
Mmm.

692
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:29,026
Excellent, brother.
 Very nice job.

693
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,128
And we're just getting
  started at this joint.

694
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,597
Remember, we're in the
 Outer Banks of North Carolina

695
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:36,600
where folks will take fresh
 catch any way they can get.

696
00:25:36,602 --> 00:25:38,602
<i>Welcome to Cravings.</i>
<i> What can I get for you today?</i>

697
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:40,738
Yep, even from a drive-through.

698
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,339
So, they can order
 the whole menu?

699
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:43,541
They can get all of it?
      Oh, yeah.

700
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:44,942
Not bad.

701
00:25:44,944 --> 00:25:46,143
Hi, how are you today?

702
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:47,211
Good, how are you doing?

703
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:48,646
Your steamer pot's ready.
   Thank you.

704
00:25:48,648 --> 00:25:50,748
It's a Carolina Coast
   tradition --

705
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:54,852
a cooking pot loaded to the hilt
 with fresh local seafood.

706
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:57,488
I'd say it'd feed a family
   of six easily.

707
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,723
Now, that's my kind of takeout.

708
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,792
Wonderful way to enjoy
    the local fare.

709
00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:03,561
You said that
very newscaster-ish.

710
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:08,999
Enjoy the local fare.

711
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:10,968
All right.
So, tell us what we do.

712
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,269
We start out with
   a little bit of ice.

713
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:14,705
Ice is in the bottom
so it keeps it cold,

714
00:26:14,707 --> 00:26:16,774
and it also works as
 the steaming liquid

715
00:26:16,776 --> 00:26:17,942
for when this gets going?

716
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:19,543
Exactly. And if you wanna
   throw a beer or wine

717
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:20,878
in there,
   that's your pleasure.

718
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,413
Live on the edge.
      Exactly.

719
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:24,348
Cut red potatoes,
    smoked sausage.

720
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,082
What kind of sausage?

721
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,450
This is a smoked sausage

722
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:27,952
from a guy named Larry
    in Fayetteville,

723
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:29,553
and of course, it's called
    Larry's sausage.

724
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:31,922
Next, we have our fresh
   local corn on the cob.

725
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:35,693
We have some wonderful
   Eastern Shore oysters,

726
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:38,796
middleneck clams,

727
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:40,531
and of course,
    some crab legs.

728
00:26:40,533 --> 00:26:41,832
Believe it or not,
    snow crab legs

729
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:43,334
are very popular
    in the Outer Banks.

730
00:26:43,336 --> 00:26:45,536
We also have the fresh
    local shrimp.

731
00:26:45,538 --> 00:26:47,605
Now, the reason I'm packing
   them in a plastic bag

732
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:49,173
is because you don't
   want to cook the shrimp

733
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:50,841
the same amount of time
    as you do the...

734
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:52,242
They'll be tough
  as can be.
      Exactly.

735
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:53,277
What is that seasoning
  there?

736
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,211
That is Old Bay,
     of course.

737
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:55,379
Okay.

738
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:58,582
And butter and cocktail
    to go along with.

739
00:26:58,584 --> 00:26:59,583
Put the lid on it?

740
00:26:59,585 --> 00:27:00,951
Lid on, and this
   is how it goes home.

741
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,052
Can you get this one
  rolling?

742
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:03,420
Okay.

743
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:04,622
Oh!
     Hello.

744
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:06,156
Takes about 20 minutes
   for the ice to melt.

745
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:07,992
But once it starts steaming,
    it takes roughly

746
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:09,093
about a half-hour.

747
00:27:09,095 --> 00:27:10,427
And the shrimp go in
   about halfway through,

748
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:11,895
so again, the shrimp
    are not overcooked.

749
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:12,796
Got it.

750
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,798
And so,
    we're ready to go.

751
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,800
Get yourself a big tray,

752
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,636
just let everything
    pour right out.

753
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:19,970
Oh, look at the broth.

754
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:21,905
Oh, the broth
    is fantastic.

755
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:23,941
The shellfish broth,
    the shrimp broth,

756
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:25,175
you got all that sausage.

757
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:29,680
The sausage just flavors
   the potatoes so well.

758
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:34,918
Okay. So, the idea is throw
it down on the table, crack it.

759
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:40,491
Mmm.
Little bit of lemon juice.

760
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:43,661
Something about shrimp
that's not been frozen, mmm.

761
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:48,399
Oh, yeah. There's nothing like
   the fresh local shrimp.

762
00:27:48,401 --> 00:27:50,067
Ding!

763
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:52,469
Mnh, mnh! Ding!

764
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:53,737
There's a lot going on here.

765
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:58,008
Four big pieces of sausage,
 potatoes, the corn.

766
00:28:00,413 --> 00:28:01,879
Excellent. And you didn't
even have to get out of your car

767
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:03,313
to get it?

768
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:04,982
No, you can get it right through
 the drive-through if you like.

769
00:28:04,984 --> 00:28:06,350
Package deal, man.

770
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:09,019
Ordering in,
  steamer pot for six.

771
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:09,953
Here's your steamer pot.

772
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:11,188
It's so simple to do.

773
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,090
Throw it on your stove
  and you're done.

774
00:28:13,092 --> 00:28:15,125
You've got a fresh,
  local seafood feast.

775
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:16,493
Gentlemen, thanks
    for having me, man.

776
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:17,661
Thanks for being here.

777
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:19,496
What an awesome joint.
    You gotta see this.

778
00:28:20,633 --> 00:28:22,299
Up next,
 we're hitting the desert

779
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:23,767
in Tempe, Arizona...

780
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:26,603
Whoo! Thanks for
the warning on that one!

781
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:28,005
...for a surprising spot...

782
00:28:28,007 --> 00:28:29,039
You're gonna love it.

783
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,774
...putting out perfect
   Pakistani.

784
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:33,077
That is some of the best chicken
we've ever had on "Triple D."

785
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:33,911
I'm not kidding you.

786
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,721
I'm here at Tempe, Arizona,
  right across the street

787
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:46,223
from Arizona State,
  home of the Sun Devils,

788
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,459
to check out some food
 you'd expect in Arizona --

789
00:28:48,461 --> 00:28:49,293
Mexican.

790
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:50,728
I'm here at Los...

791
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,563
No, Dos...

792
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:53,964
Oh, no, that's
  a different place!

793
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:56,500
I'm here to check out some
 Pakistani food at this joint,

794
00:28:56,502 --> 00:28:58,569
the Curry Corner.

795
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:04,708
- Shrimp Handi.
   -It's a gem.

796
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,243
I would've never expected
  to find an authentic

797
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,278
Pakistani restaurant
  in a shopping center.

798
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,447
I travelled to Pakistan,
and I lived there for two years.

799
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:12,816
And this is just like
 what I used to eat there.

800
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:16,887
In the world of Pakistani food,
 this is 100% legit?

801
00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:18,555
101% legit.

802
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:19,923
101% legit?

803
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:22,126
So is Farah Khalid,

804
00:29:22,128 --> 00:29:25,262
who grew up in the
 Punjab region of Pakistan.

805
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:27,331
And after travelling the world
  with her husband,

806
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,666
they settled in Tempe...

807
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:31,668
Tandoori chicken tikka
     ready!

808
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,804
...where she's been pushing
  the culinary envelope

809
00:29:33,806 --> 00:29:35,372
since 2002.

810
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:37,775
Food all across the board
 is fantastic here.

811
00:29:37,777 --> 00:29:39,877
They cook it in
a traditional tandoori oven,

812
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:41,245
which is really unique.

813
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:43,847
It's a blazing-hot clay oven
   cranking out

814
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:46,550
this Indian and Pakistani
   classic.

815
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:47,818
Tandoori chicken tikka.

816
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,820
Rich and spicy, but not hot.

817
00:29:49,822 --> 00:29:52,523
And flavored
 with the righteous spice mix

818
00:29:52,525 --> 00:29:53,724
called garam masala.

819
00:29:53,726 --> 00:29:55,926
Holy nutmeg, Batman!

820
00:29:55,928 --> 00:29:57,528
All of these
 are going in there?

821
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:58,495
Yes.

822
00:29:58,497 --> 00:29:59,596
All right.
So, let's get it going.

823
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:01,865
Green cardamom,
    whole nutmeg.

824
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:03,000
All the nutmeg?

825
00:30:03,002 --> 00:30:06,003
Black pepper, cloves,
    white cumin seeds.

826
00:30:06,005 --> 00:30:06,937
What is this?

827
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:07,938
Dried apricot.

828
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,640
It looks like dried apricot.

829
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:12,876
This is the whole mace.
    It's very strong.

830
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:13,977
Yeah, you're telling me.

831
00:30:14,914 --> 00:30:16,880
Whoo!

832
00:30:16,882 --> 00:30:20,117
Thanks for the warning
 on that one!

833
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:24,621
Black cardamom, bay leaves.

834
00:30:24,623 --> 00:30:29,059
The nutmeg beans are that
big, and nutmeg is so hard,

835
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:31,795
she goes through about
one of these every week.

836
00:30:31,797 --> 00:30:33,030
Okay. So, now we have
 the Garam Masala.

837
00:30:33,032 --> 00:30:36,834
Okay. And now we are going
  to do the chicken tikka.

838
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:38,235
Ginger garlic.

839
00:30:38,237 --> 00:30:39,736
Pureed ginger
 and pureed garlic.

840
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:43,841
Yes. Lemon juice, oil,
   and yellow food color.

841
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:45,442
Really? Number 5?

842
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:47,578
I don't like it the tandoori
    very, very red.

843
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,979
No, I don't like it
     that much.

844
00:30:48,981 --> 00:30:54,785
Tomato puree, the salt,
 chili powder, cayenne powder,

845
00:30:54,787 --> 00:30:57,521
and last we are
    using Garam Masala.

846
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:58,856
You can smell it.

847
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:00,390
Oh, no.
 I know that joke.

848
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:03,760
That's super potent.

849
00:31:03,762 --> 00:31:05,462
Be careful.

850
00:31:06,765 --> 00:31:07,764
Is it good?

851
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:12,102
I didn't taste it yet!
 You taste it!

852
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:13,003
It's ready to go.

853
00:31:13,005 --> 00:31:14,438
Oh, that's not,
 "Be careful."

854
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,305
That's,
"You're gonna love it."

855
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:17,007
Ohh!

856
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:19,343
The chicken leg
    is the best.

857
00:31:19,345 --> 00:31:21,311
You gotta go
with that dark meat.

858
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:24,314
So, a little score so the sauce
will get down in there.

859
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:26,016
And we're going to skewer
 that onto this?

860
00:31:26,018 --> 00:31:26,683
Yes.

861
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:32,155
Okay. So, we get all
 the sauce in there,

862
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:34,458
let it go for overnight.

863
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,728
All right. So, now you go
 in, around, down,

864
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,630
skewer it though.
      Yes.

865
00:31:39,632 --> 00:31:41,031
How many pieces will
you put on a skewer?

866
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:43,934
Two pieces in one order.

867
00:31:43,936 --> 00:31:45,369
Okay. It's going in
 the tandoor?

868
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:47,537
Yes.

869
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:48,906
So, 15 minutes?

870
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:50,340
Yeah.

871
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:53,610
Yeah.

872
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:54,878
Yeah!

873
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,114
Thank you.

874
00:31:57,116 --> 00:31:59,283
Is that ghee,
 or is that butter?

875
00:31:59,285 --> 00:32:00,717
It's the butter.

876
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:04,221
Now, this is the cilantro.

877
00:32:04,223 --> 00:32:06,556
And now you are
    going to taste it.

878
00:32:17,303 --> 00:32:18,201
It's good?

879
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:20,804
This is out of bounds.

880
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:23,173
Super rich flavor,
little bit of spice,

881
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:24,875
little bit of ginger,
little bit of garlic,

882
00:32:24,877 --> 00:32:26,410
roasted down to where
 it's just starting

883
00:32:26,412 --> 00:32:27,811
to separate,
 come off the bone.

884
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:32,282
And smoking hot that is.

885
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,216
Wow!

886
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:34,451
That is some
 of the best chicken

887
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:37,454
we've ever had on "Triple D."
I'm not kidding you.

888
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,456
Oh-ho!

889
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:43,193
It's really tender,
 a little spicy, tastes amazing.

890
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:45,729
We had them cater
his second birthday party.

891
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:48,165
Some Pakistani food
 for my kid's second birthday.

892
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:50,200
We'll do a whole-hog
  barbecue for your fifth.

893
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:52,736
Or a whole goat,
  like the Pakistanis do.

894
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:55,939
In Pakistan, goat is
  a very common food.

895
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:57,040
So, what are we making?

896
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:59,876
We are making
    the goat karahi.

897
00:32:59,878 --> 00:33:02,846
I'm going to boil the goat
    and ginger-garlic,

898
00:33:02,848 --> 00:33:05,816
salt, bay leaves,
    black pepper,

899
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:08,051
and a little bit of cloves.

900
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:09,886
And then water.

901
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,854
Cook it down for how long?

902
00:33:10,856 --> 00:33:12,723
It takes, like,
     30 minutes.

903
00:33:12,725 --> 00:33:14,224
What does "karahi" mean?

904
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:16,760
Karahi means the wok.

905
00:33:16,762 --> 00:33:19,296
Do you use a wok
a lot in Pakistani cooking?

906
00:33:19,298 --> 00:33:19,963
Yes. The ginger-garlic.

907
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:23,100
Ginger-garlic mix.

908
00:33:23,102 --> 00:33:25,402
What is this
magnificent mixture?

909
00:33:25,404 --> 00:33:27,371
This is
   an onion-based puree.

910
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:29,906
So, I'm going to put
   a little bit of that.

911
00:33:29,908 --> 00:33:31,775
Place the tomatoes inside.

912
00:33:33,979 --> 00:33:35,812
And I am going to cover it.

913
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:36,947
How long's that go?

914
00:33:36,949 --> 00:33:38,415
This goes like
     10 minutes.

915
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:41,451
It becomes more, you know,
   tender and more juicy.

916
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:42,886
So it really cooks down.

917
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:45,455
And now we are going
   to do the naan for you.

918
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:46,556
N-A-A-N?

919
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:47,657
N-A-A-N.

920
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:49,226
Let's start with yogurt,

921
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:52,429
milk, dry yeast,
    baking powder,

922
00:33:52,431 --> 00:33:55,632
sugar, oil, eggs,

923
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:58,435
salt, flour.

924
00:33:58,437 --> 00:34:02,639
So, we are going to make
  one garlic and one cheese.

925
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:07,310
This is the garlic naan.

926
00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:10,213
This is going to be
    a cheese naan.

927
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,949
Okay.

928
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:14,384
We call that a quesadilla.

929
00:34:18,991 --> 00:34:20,424
And that's it,
 right on the side?

930
00:34:20,426 --> 00:34:21,091
You want to try that?

931
00:34:21,093 --> 00:34:22,592
Yeah!

932
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:23,593
I'm down with it.

933
00:34:23,595 --> 00:34:25,262
Okay, right up here?

934
00:34:25,264 --> 00:34:26,463
- Oh.
   -Too high?

935
00:34:26,465 --> 00:34:30,700
- No, I think it's okay.
    -Okay.

936
00:34:30,702 --> 00:34:33,336
Look at that thing puffing.

937
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:34,438
And now you are
    going to do it.

938
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,742
Aah!

939
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:39,609
Excellent job!

940
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:42,746
Huh, what do you think?

941
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:45,148
Let's see our goat karahi.

942
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,951
Now I'm going to
   put the yogurt in it.

943
00:34:47,953 --> 00:34:51,688
Ground cumin, coriander,
    black pepper,

944
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:54,224
little bit of salt,
    sliced ginger,

945
00:34:54,226 --> 00:34:57,194
green chilies,
    fresh cilantro.

946
00:34:57,196 --> 00:34:59,362
The most important part --
     the butter.

947
00:35:04,203 --> 00:35:07,003
And then we will put a little
 bit more cilantro on the top

948
00:35:07,005 --> 00:35:09,206
and a little bit
    more ginger.

949
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:11,908
Right. So, we got the garlic
naan and the cheese naan.

950
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,445
There's the one with cheese.

951
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,113
That's the cheese.

952
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:17,214
Mmm.

953
00:35:17,216 --> 00:35:18,782
Are you supposed to
 eat this by hand?

954
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:20,484
No, you can use a fork.

955
00:35:20,486 --> 00:35:23,820
Mmm. Now you tell me.

956
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:25,489
Oh, my gosh.

957
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:28,191
The goat cooked down like that,
 it's super tender.

958
00:35:28,193 --> 00:35:32,462
A little bit of the spiciness
 to the creaminess.

959
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:35,298
Reduction of the sauce,
the fresh cilantro in there,

960
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,901
all those little nuances
 come together.

961
00:35:37,903 --> 00:35:40,704
Ah, I can't stop!

962
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:44,508
All-around delicious dish.

963
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,877
It's spicy and always fresh.

964
00:35:46,879 --> 00:35:48,712
There's many different
  options for ethnic food

965
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:50,780
down here, but this is the one
 that I keep coming back to.

966
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:52,215
This is the flavor temple.

967
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:54,851
You live in Arizona
anywhere close to Phoenix,

968
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:56,386
you haven't checked
 this place out,

969
00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:57,687
you are missing it.

970
00:35:57,689 --> 00:35:58,655
Awesome.

971
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,423
- Thank you.
   -Thank you.

972
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:05,762
Coming up,
  in Pasadena, Florida...

973
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:07,430
I put on 30 pounds
   since I've been here!

974
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:09,766
...a decades-old
  beach town treasure...

975
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:12,002
Look at you, man!
    You are a machine!

976
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:14,070
...where their special spin
   is the smoke.

977
00:36:14,072 --> 00:36:14,938
Who would've thunk?

978
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:22,946
I'm here cruising the beach area
 in St. Petersburg, Florida,

979
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:24,080
right outside of Tampa.

980
00:36:24,082 --> 00:36:26,049
Now, the reason I'm here
   is because

981
00:36:26,051 --> 00:36:27,684
so many of you
  have e-mailed me,

982
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:31,021
telling me about this joint
 I just gotta check out --

983
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:33,857
Ted Peters Famous Smoked Fish.

984
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,525
Nice call.

985
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:36,760
Can't you smell it?

986
00:36:36,762 --> 00:36:39,396
It's a smokehouse over there.

987
00:36:39,398 --> 00:36:41,531
The very first time
we came, he bought me

988
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,633
one of those
smoked mackerel pieces.

989
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:44,901
Romantic.

990
00:36:44,903 --> 00:36:46,703
The salmon -- It's so good.

991
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:48,738
Grab a fork.

992
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,940
Mmm.

993
00:36:49,942 --> 00:36:51,274
I put on 30 pounds
  since I've been here!

994
00:36:51,276 --> 00:36:53,510
Thanks to the e-mailers
  who got me down here.

995
00:36:53,512 --> 00:36:55,445
You can just sit back,
   relax, enjoy your meal.

996
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:56,913
This is, like,
 fifth generation.

997
00:36:56,915 --> 00:37:00,050
The place itself has been
 family-run for 56 years.

998
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:02,652
Co-owner Michael Lathrop's
  uncle was the guy

999
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:03,887
with his name on the sign

1000
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:06,489
and the good idea
 to turn a backyard hobby,

1001
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:08,692
smoking fish,
  into a business.

1002
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:10,827
Yeah, Ted Peters.
 He took it from the backyard,

1003
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:12,495
stuck it out
    in the front yard,

1004
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:15,332
and kind of waved the traffic
   down as it would go by.

1005
00:37:15,334 --> 00:37:17,634
And people would put
   the brakes on, back up,

1006
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:19,069
and say,
   "What's that about?"

1007
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:22,672
Today, folks are still jamming
on the brakes for smoked salmon,

1008
00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:25,642
mahimahi, and the hometown
  favorite, mullet.

1009
00:37:25,644 --> 00:37:28,011
In here, through
   the John Wayne doors?

1010
00:37:28,013 --> 00:37:29,212
Yep.

1011
00:37:29,214 --> 00:37:31,381
Still made the same way
  by the same family.

1012
00:37:31,383 --> 00:37:32,749
This is our fishmonger
 for the day?

1013
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,618
Ben,
 he's fifth-generation here.

1014
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,053
Nice to meet you.
It's like a piece of history.

1015
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:38,488
I just shook
 the Liberty Bell.

1016
00:37:40,192 --> 00:37:42,459
So, what I'm gonna do
    is run some salt

1017
00:37:42,461 --> 00:37:44,928
light over all the fish.

1018
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,796
And then, we'll put
  our mixture on all of them.

1019
00:37:46,798 --> 00:37:48,565
And what is the mixture?

1020
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:49,599
Our secret sauce.

1021
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:50,767
Well, you gotta give me
 a basis of it.

1022
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,202
Are we tomato based
 in here? Are we...

1023
00:37:52,204 --> 00:37:53,370
Yeah, tomato base.

1024
00:37:53,372 --> 00:37:55,905
I can see oil in it.
But you're not stirring it up.

1025
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:57,307
You're not putting a lot on.

1026
00:37:57,309 --> 00:37:59,376
No, it's just real light
 just to keep it from burning,

1027
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:00,844
give it a little color.

1028
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:03,079
Just pick it up
    by the tray here.

1029
00:38:03,081 --> 00:38:06,449
Just slide it in the cart and
 take it over to the smokehouse.

1030
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:08,918
I've never taken my smoked fish
 for a walk before.

1031
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,955
All right. Just take the tray
  and slide it in there.

1032
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:15,892
So, I guess that you have
    be a family member

1033
00:38:15,894 --> 00:38:17,827
or you have to have
   the eagle-span reach.

1034
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:19,062
Did you see that?

1035
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:20,563
Yeah, little guys
  don't do this well.

1036
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:21,898
What are we smoking with?

1037
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,199
This is red oak.

1038
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:24,968
What's going to happen
  in a few minutes,

1039
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:27,437
you're going to have such
 a concentration of smoke

1040
00:38:27,439 --> 00:38:29,406
in there that
  it's gonna be equally

1041
00:38:29,408 --> 00:38:31,341
seeping out of all the trays.

1042
00:38:31,343 --> 00:38:33,743
Do they go in at a certain
   location to start with?

1043
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:36,813
Yeah. You want the raw
  fish on the bottom.

1044
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:39,149
And as you add,
   you raise up.

1045
00:38:39,151 --> 00:38:40,583
You don't just set it
    and forget it.

1046
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:43,119
You actually have to be
 participating every 15 minutes,

1047
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:44,854
pulling the rack,
  looking where you're at,

1048
00:38:44,856 --> 00:38:46,122
seeing how things
    are moving along.

1049
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:48,958
You guys ever heard
  about second-hand smoke?

1050
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,894
Next stop's
  the cooling cabinet

1051
00:38:50,896 --> 00:38:52,562
and they're ready to serve.

1052
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:55,432
They got the best
 smoked fish there is around.

1053
00:38:55,434 --> 00:38:57,267
And now they have salmon,
which is unbelievable.

1054
00:38:57,269 --> 00:38:59,402
Smoked mullet's
    really good, too.

1055
00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:05,608
That's tasty.

1056
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:07,210
Who would've thunk?

1057
00:39:07,212 --> 00:39:09,079
And who'd have
  thunk up this one?

1058
00:39:09,081 --> 00:39:12,315
It's a top seller --
 smoked fish all chopped up

1059
00:39:12,317 --> 00:39:14,951
into Ted Peters'
  legendary fish spread.

1060
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:16,686
Be sure to order
 the fish spread.

1061
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:19,589
I hear out of everything
at Ted Peters, this is, like,

1062
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:21,291
the spread is, like,
  the kicker.

1063
00:39:21,293 --> 00:39:22,359
This is the thing.

1064
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:23,760
So, what is made
 in the fish spread?

1065
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:24,928
That is mahi and mullet.

1066
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,196
The mullet is the kicker
  to the spread, though.

1067
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:27,997
The --

1068
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:31,501
Can't use my --
    That's my word!

1069
00:39:31,503 --> 00:39:32,702
I wondered where
  I heard it from.

1070
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,371
Okay. So, you break
    it down by hand.

1071
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:36,106
Then it goes into
    this grinder

1072
00:39:36,108 --> 00:39:37,741
to make sure
   that it's uniform size.

1073
00:39:37,743 --> 00:39:38,808
Exactly.

1074
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:39,843
So, what you want to do
   is you want

1075
00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:41,544
to get it fluffy as you can.

1076
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:42,846
Now, we're gonna
   add celery and onion.

1077
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,513
Celery and onion.

1078
00:39:43,515 --> 00:39:44,180
Pickle relish.

1079
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:45,115
It's sweet relish.

1080
00:39:45,117 --> 00:39:47,083
You're gonna mix 'em again.

1081
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:48,084
It's always by hand?

1082
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:49,352
It's always by hand.

1083
00:39:49,354 --> 00:39:50,920
Okay.
  Now, the salad dressing.

1084
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:52,122
It holds it together.

1085
00:39:52,124 --> 00:39:54,457
This definitely,
 you gotta shoulder muscles for.

1086
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:56,926
Look at you, man!
    You are a machine!

1087
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:04,134
What pulls that
    all together --

1088
00:40:04,136 --> 00:40:07,070
the onion,
     the celery,

1089
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:09,139
and the smoke.

1090
00:40:09,141 --> 00:40:10,673
That's really good,
     actually.

1091
00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:12,709
You can get the fish
  spread on a sandwich,

1092
00:40:12,711 --> 00:40:16,012
but lots of folks get it as part
 of the meal locals know as...

1093
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:17,614
The Ted Peters
   surf and turf.

1094
00:40:17,616 --> 00:40:20,483
You eat the fish spread,
 and then, that's the fish.

1095
00:40:20,485 --> 00:40:21,985
And then you eat the hamburger,
  and that's the...

1096
00:40:21,987 --> 00:40:23,620
That's the surf and turf.

1097
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:25,955
Their cheeseburgers are great.

1098
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:26,823
That's a real burger.

1099
00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:28,024
That is.

1100
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:30,126
The cheese, it always
   stays melted,

1101
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:32,862
so it's always,
  like, extra gooey.

1102
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:34,697
Besides, where else
   can you eat on plates

1103
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:36,766
that remind you of your
 elementary school cafeteria?

1104
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:37,901
You're right.

1105
00:40:37,903 --> 00:40:40,837
And to round out
the total Ted Peters experience,

1106
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:43,239
the locals have
  one more suggestion.

1107
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:45,408
Be sure and get
  the warm potato salad.

1108
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,477
And now we take the bacon.

1109
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:49,446
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
    Hot grease and all?

1110
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:50,447
Yes.

1111
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:52,515
Mmm, that is up
    there in the top

1112
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:54,050
best potato salads
    I've ever had.

1113
00:40:54,052 --> 00:40:56,252
Fits right in
  with the surf and turf

1114
00:40:56,254 --> 00:40:57,420
and the smoked mullet.

1115
00:40:57,422 --> 00:40:58,688
I love smoked mullet.

1116
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,223
I've never had anything else
 here, to tell you the truth.

1117
00:41:00,225 --> 00:41:02,559
And the whole Ted Peters thing
  that folks around here

1118
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:05,328
have been coming back
   for since 1951.

1119
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,830
I had my first
 smoked mullet

1120
00:41:06,832 --> 00:41:09,699
about 30 years ago
 at this place.

1121
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:11,334
How long have you
 been coming here?

1122
00:41:11,336 --> 00:41:13,203
25 years.

1123
00:41:13,205 --> 00:41:15,138
Were you in a stroller?
       Yes.

1124
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,841
So many people look at us
    as not the owners,

1125
00:41:17,843 --> 00:41:21,444
but the caretakers of something
    that's part theirs,

1126
00:41:21,446 --> 00:41:23,313
because this restaurant
    in this area

1127
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:27,217
is the last thing that anchors
  their childhood memories.

1128
00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:30,119
And did you think that sending
 in an e-mail to Food Network

1129
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:33,056
for "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives"
  was gonna turn into this?

1130
00:41:33,058 --> 00:41:35,725
I need to stop sitting up
at 2:00 in the morning

1131
00:41:35,727 --> 00:41:37,994
half-asleep and tapping
 on the keyboard.

1132
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:40,797
I have to say thanks, man.

1133
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:42,332
So, that's it
  for this road trip.

1134
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:44,534
But don't worry, we got
  plenty more joints

1135
00:41:44,536 --> 00:41:46,336
to find all over this country!

1136
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:48,004
I'll be looking
  for you next time,

1137
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:51,374
on "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives."

1138
00:41:51,376 --> 00:41:52,642
If that was
 an '80s rock star,

1139
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:54,377
that would be "Naan" Jovi.

1140
00:41:56,448 --> 00:41:57,947
Naan Jovi!
