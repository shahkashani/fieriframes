00:00:01,635 --> 00:00:03,068
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

2
00:00:03,104 --> 00:00:05,737
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

3
00:00:05,773 --> 00:00:07,206
          This trip...          

4
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:09,141
             O-M-G.             

5
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:11,342
          ...I'm taking         
     a killer food vacation     

6
00:00:11,379 --> 00:00:13,078
       in sunny San Diego.      

7
00:00:13,114 --> 00:00:15,280
   Well, that's a great start.  
     Now what are we making?    

8
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:18,283
     There's the Ocean Beach    
          burger shack          

9
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:20,219
        where my brother        
     from another mother...     

10
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:21,754
              This is gonna be  
              stupid delicious. 

11
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:24,490
      ...is raising the bar     
      on big-time burgers.      

12
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:27,426
    Call your mommy!            
That's a lot of pastrami!       

13
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:28,493
                 [ Laughs ]     

14
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:31,296
    And just down the street,   
        a noodle house...       

15
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:33,365
    Unbelievable.               

16
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:35,300
  ...making making phat pho...  

17
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,234
   Phoggedaboutit.              

18
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:37,369
       ...way-out wings...      

19
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:38,837
I'll be Jumping Bullet.         

20
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:39,904
                    Okay.       
      You be...                 

21
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,306
                  Habañero.     
...Hoppin' Arrow.               

22
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:43,976
 ...and a certified fried rice. 
   KYLE: Can you feel the heat? 

23
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:45,710
           I can feel           
           the heat.            

24
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,381
    And I can't leave without   
   a pit stop in North Park...  

25
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:50,916
                    Whoa!       
             Look at that move. 

26
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:53,852
         ...for a slice         
    from a "Triple D" legend.   

27
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:56,121
They're gonna throw me          
    out of Italy.               
        They're gonna throw you 
                 out of Italy?  

28
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:59,725
      That's all right here,    
      right now, on "Triple D." 

29
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:13,538
     I'm here in San Diego,     

30
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:16,341
         or "San Diago"         
 as Ron Burgundy would call it, 

31
00:01:16,377 --> 00:01:17,342
     and I'm in Ocean Beach.    

32
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,944
        I come down here        
      for a lot of reasons.     

33
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:20,212
     But I got to be honest,    

34
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:22,347
    the main reason is to see   
 my brother from another mother.

35
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:23,815
         That's right --        
       the burger bad boy,      

36
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:26,484
       the dude that's got      
   a tattoo of me on his leg.   

37
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,619
       Yeah, Mike Hardin.       

38
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:30,322
    We're here for a revisit    
     and update at Hodad's.     

39
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,163
        <i> Un hamburguesa.</i>        

40
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:40,165
 The best hamburger in America. 

41
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:42,634
   FIERI: Not much has changed  

42
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,171
   since we first visited the   
 original Hodad's back in 2007. 

43
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:47,940
      Lean over                 
   and trough it.               

44
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:51,109
      You got a couple more     
        license plates...       

45
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:55,047
     It just gets more and more 
           out of bounds.       

46
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:56,748
       ...a longer line...      

47
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:00,318
         Go ahead and show them 
             the weirdness.     

48
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:03,255
   ...and there's that tattoo   
        I told you about.       

49
00:02:03,324 --> 00:02:04,890
    Hoo-hoo-hoo!                

50
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,460
  Oh, there's one other thing.  

51
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:10,062
   I have something             
called a Guido burger.          

52
00:02:10,064 --> 00:02:12,531
You've been asking me           
 for a couple years             

53
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:13,999
to make pastrami burger.        

54
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,233
              So, you made it?  
     Yeah.                      

55
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:17,669
    MAN: Here comes a Guido.    

56
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:19,404
              You guys want try 
               a Guido burger?  

57
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,872
                 Let's go do    
               a Guido burger.  

58
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,540
Let's rock 'n' roll.            

59
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:25,277
 So, what we do is we start off 
     by putting the bun on.     

60
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:27,345
 No butter, no nada?            

61
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:29,348
        No. It doesn't need it. 
     Okay. Okay.                

62
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,884
          But it does need --   
       It needs a little spice. 

63
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,620
        Okay.                   
      So you put a little spice 
                 on the bun,    

64
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:37,623
                  and that      
             just kind of helps.

65
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:40,892
              Oh, look at that. 
That's what you want --         
a little crust to it.           

66
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:43,695
    Now, do you mind if I throw 
        the hamburger patty on? 
   Go right ahead.              

67
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:45,163
   That's a 1/3 pound.          

68
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,933
   Always like to put a little  
   spice on top of there, too.  

69
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:49,367
   It's a season salt.          

70
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:52,237
Put some scores on there to kind
of flatten it out a little bit. 

71
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:54,439
                I'm gonna put   
                pastrami on.    

72
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:56,975
         You're gonna think,    
     "Oh, no, he's not gonna put

73
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:58,577
         "this much pastrami on.

74
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:01,647
            Oh, no, wait.       
     How much is he putting on?"

75
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:03,982
    Call your mommy!            
That's a lot of pastrami!       

76
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:05,050
                 [ Laughs ]     

77
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:07,252
I do like the crust.            

78
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:09,254
 I do like the crust.           

79
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,123
         Little bit of spice -- 
               little bit.      

80
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:14,726
       Now what we're gonna do, 
          on the bottom bun,    

81
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:17,729
               we're gonna put  
               ketchup on it.   

82
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:20,065
             Now, this is really
                the clincher.   

83
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,534
               It's the kosher  
             dill pickle chips. 

84
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:24,936
           These are amazing.   
         You're gonna love this.

85
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:27,405
         Now, you always go     
     counter-clockwise, always. 

86
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:28,607
It changes the flavor.          

87
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:31,209
      You go the other way,     
  and it's not kosher anymore.  

88
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:32,544
           You don't want that. 

89
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:34,879
    Now, the Swiss cheese --    
A lot of people don't like Swiss

90
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:35,948
     'cause it has holes in it. 

91
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,616
               I say, "Well,    
           just eat around it." 

92
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:39,351
            You know, you don't 
           really have to eat --

93
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:40,886
      So, you put this on here. 
        Okay.                   

94
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:43,755
         Now, I want the cheese 
  to kind of melt a little bit. 
     Good call.                 

95
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:46,491
Now, I am gonna put the pastrami
         on top of there        

96
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:48,493
         'cause that's actually 
               gonna help.      

97
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,162
           Now, we're not done. 

98
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:51,630
   We're gonna put some grilled,
        caramelized onions      

99
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:52,964
               on top of that.  

100
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:53,965
               Oh, here we go.  

101
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:55,233
     Ridiculous.                
              Isn't that silly? 

102
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:56,768
          That's crazy.         

103
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,304
         Now, crème de la crème,
          whatever that means.  

104
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,706
         We use a brown mustard.

105
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,175
 Put plenty of mustard on there.
          Look at that.         

106
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:06,245
         Now, I'm gonna put this
                 on top.        

107
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,515
              This is gonna be  
              stupid delicious. 

108
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:11,582
    I like that.                

109
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,118
       I'm gonna bring it over. 

110
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,919
                Oh, my gosh.    
                Look at that.   

111
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:18,089
                Now, this is    
             the burger diaper. 

112
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:20,592
           We're gonna surround 
                this thing.     

113
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,462
                Look at that.   
                 [ Laughs ]     

114
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,230
And that's the Guido?           
                 That's it.

00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:33,805
 Do I have anything             
     right here?                
               No, no, no, no.  

116
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,206
I need, like, a shampoo.        

117
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:36,941
          [ Laughter ]          

118
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:40,412
     Delicious burger,          
but look at this pastrami.      

119
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:41,546
     Real deal.                 

120
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,682
I like how you crisp it up      
      on the flattop,           

121
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:46,285
and the Swiss cheese.           

122
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,953
      You give                  
such a great product.           

123
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:48,887
The burger's righteous.         

124
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,855
         Such                   
an eclectic experience.         

125
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:54,426
  When somebody names a burger  
  of this magnitude after you,  

126
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:56,427
you can't say anything          
        but...                  

127
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,363
  I love you, man.              
  You're the bomb.              

128
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:00,165
  Thanks, brother.              

129
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:03,134
           All right.           
         We got a Guido!        

130
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,236
          The pastrami          
     just makes this burger.    

131
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:06,538
  It just melts in your mouth.  

132
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:09,741
      The flavor's amazing.     

133
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,712
        So, you got             
a "Triple D" joint for me?      

134
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:15,847
               There's a place  
               in Ocean Beach   

135
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,249
               that's called    
           the OB Noodle House. 

136
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:19,250
   You eat there?               
                 Oh, yeah!      
                 Heck yeah!     

137
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:21,453
  They accept you?              
                      Yeah.     

138
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:23,321
 I'll make it in?               
                     Yeah.      

139
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:24,856
And the food's legit?           
                    Yeah!       

140
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:25,990
     All right.                 

141
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,059
  Hanging out with Mike Hardin  
       at Hodad's in O.B.       

142
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:30,195
And when we come back,          
 we're hitting the...           

143
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,397
      Ocean Beach Noodle House. 
  See you in a bit.             

144
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:34,433
                  Yee-hoo!      
 Let's go.                      

145
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:51,283
             All right, Hodad.  
             This is the joint. 

146
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:52,551
               How's the food?  

147
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,886
         Food's amazing,        
  and the story is even better. 

148
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:55,953
                   That's       
              my kind of joint. 

149
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:58,523
                  This is       
           the OB Noodle House. 

150
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:04,896
       Spicy garlic wings.      

151
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,497
        Table two ready.        
          Take it out.          

152
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,167
    I love the noodle house.    
STEVE: Chicken and lettuce wrap 
            is done.            

153
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:10,902
    This is the best restaurant 
    in Ocean Beach.             

154
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,840
  FIERI:                        
  A little corner of San Diego  
  built on sun, sand, and surf. 

155
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:17,842
   Ocean Beach                  
   is one of the last remaining 

156
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,912
   old-school beach communities 
   in California.               

157
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:22,981
        I want to introduce you 
                 to Steve...    
         'Sup, brother?         

158
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,382
               ...the owner     
           of the Noodle House. 

159
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:25,450
                 Oh, you're     
               gonna love it.   

160
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:26,852
        Mike should know.       

161
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,053
 He's been lining up since '08, 

162
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:32,057
    when Steve and Kyle Yeng    
    first opened the doors.     

163
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,391
    The brothers are awesome.   
    They work well together.    

164
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,394
        FIERI: Taking up        
    the Chinese culinary path   

165
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,997
     their parents laid down    
   when they came to the U.S.   

166
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,064
          in the '90s.          

167
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:41,666
    House special fried rice.   

168
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,001
               Sizzling fish?   
   Sizzling fish.               

169
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:44,336
    Outstanding.                

170
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:46,404
    It's really hard to beat    
        a big bowl of pho       

171
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,173
       after a mid-morning      
          surf session.         

172
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,343
   Phoggedaboutit.              

173
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:53,478
 It would be pho --             
       P-H-O.                   

174
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:56,481
And everybody mispronounces it, 
but it's really pronounced...   
           BOTH: "Fa."          

175
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,417
  This is what goes             
   into your pho?               

176
00:06:58,552 --> 00:06:59,617
Oh, I got to see this.          

177
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,752
  All right, so, start it off.  
         First thing up.        

178
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:03,688
Loading up the bones.           
                   Uh-huh.      
             Load up the bones. 

179
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,824
There's probably about          
15 gallons of water.            
                   Uh-huh.      

180
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:07,692
      Now we go                 
   with oxtails.                
                   Oxtails.     

181
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,496
         Next, we got briskets. 

182
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:12,831
               60, 70 pounds.   

183
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,633
    Ton of meat.                
      Yeah, it's a ton of meat. 

184
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:16,435
      Then what                 
   do we got here?              
          And here, it's called 
                 drop flank.    

185
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,502
       <i> Flank.</i>                  
                   Flank.       

186
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:19,370
       This is                  
       a very, very tough meat. 

187
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:20,304
    Where does it               
     come from?                 

188
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,640
         The cow's chin.        

189
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,642
        And the last thing      
   that goes out is the tendons.

190
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:25,844
    Beef tendons.               

191
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:27,312
                   Uh-huh.      

192
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:29,780
         I mean, I know         
  that we don't use the bones,  

193
00:07:29,817 --> 00:07:31,583
 so when the meat starts to cook
        and it gets done,       

194
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:32,917
  we'll pull that?              
           We'll pull that out. 

195
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:34,319
        About five hours or so. 

196
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,787
So it doesn't overcook          
       too much.                

197
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,922
Wow. What a process.            
     Every day?                 

198
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:38,857
        BOTH: Every day.        

199
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:40,725
           So, we got to flavor 
              the meat, also.   

200
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:42,461
             This is rock sugar,
                rock candies.   

201
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:43,528
      And salt?                 
                  And salt.     

202
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,063
         We actually don't dump 
         all of it out,         

203
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,598
         only about half of it. 

204
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:49,200
      This one is shallots      
that we have peeled and grilled.

205
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:51,336
   This is ginger that we peeled
         and also grilled.      

206
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:52,804
         The cinnamon's are big.

207
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,072
              You can throw it  
             in the soup, also. 

208
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:55,674
Those you can dig out.          
  You can find those.           

209
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,143
       We let this go for about 
       another 45 minutes or so.

210
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:01,880
       And the last step,       
we actually make a spice basket.

211
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,948
             Toasted star anise.

212
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:04,949
  A lot of cloves.              

213
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:06,551
               Lots of cloves.  

214
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,820
                 Here we got    
                fennel seeds.   

215
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,021
       That's all been toasted. 
       Got it.                  

216
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,290
      Uh-huh. And then we close 
      the baskets here.         

217
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,426
Take the basket of fun,         
   we drop that in.             

218
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:15,560
               15, 20 minutes.  

219
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:18,563
       And at the same time,    
   you can also add fish sauce. 

220
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:20,265
             Bring it to a boil.

221
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:22,834
Add the rest of that --         
 salt and the sugar.            
                         Yes.   

222
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,904
All this work and effort        
makes 20 gallons worth of broth?
         Of concentrated broth. 

223
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:26,905
        Wow.                    
   What a process.              

224
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,040
So, this is the brisket         
 that cooked in there,          

225
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,709
      the flank                 
that cooked in there,           

226
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,343
     the tendon                 
that cooked in there.           

227
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,711
      Rare steak and tripe.     

228
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:35,981
                 So, we grab    
             fresh rice noodles.

229
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:37,182
                   This is      
             hot boiling water. 

230
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:38,449
       Pretty much just cook it 

231
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,252
               for maybe about  
             five, six seconds. 

232
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:41,920
        Okay.                   
     That's it?                 
                 That's it.     

233
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:46,791
   Next, we get the noodle here 
      and put some brisket...   

234
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:48,126
             then some flank... 

235
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:49,594
     and these are some tendons.

236
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,796
             Put some onions,   
           tripes on the side...

237
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,398
           some green onions... 

238
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,199
             couple of layers   
           of rare meat in here.

239
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:57,268
This is how much meat           
you put in this bowl?           

240
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:59,870
           That's why we call it
           a number-one special.

241
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:03,074
         Now we put some broth. 

242
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,809
       Then a little cilantros. 

243
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:06,744
               Just like that.  
                 It's done.     

244
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:09,114
 I just want to try             
this broth by itself.           

245
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:15,020
    Unbelievable.               

246
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:16,421
Look how clear it is.           

247
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,155
   Like consommé.               

248
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:20,691
     Mmm.                       

249
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,361
   And to kick it up, you can   
 actually add the sauté sauce --

250
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,829
                 give it        
         a little extra flavor. 

251
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,531
Get a little bit of spice       
        in there.               

252
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:32,036
             Sauté.             

253
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,106
You're gonna have a pretty tough
   time finding it this good.   

254
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,444
  You got a new brother         
at OB Noodle House, man.        

255
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,380

         OB special pho.        

256
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:43,581
         I've had a lot of pho. 

257
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,916
     This really is of the best.
          Don't you agree?      

258
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:47,051
       This is excellent.       

259
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,521
  Ocean Beach is a really small 
        beach community.        

260

       They're very proud       
       of their identity.       

261
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:52,724
         This restaurant        
       definitely fits it.      

262
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:55,193
          40-plus taps          
      of really good beer.      

263

             FIERI:             
    And what goes with beer?    

264
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:58,596
        Of course, wings.       

265
00:09:58,632 --> 00:09:59,798
       Spicy garlic wings.      

266

       that I've ever had.      

267
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:06,271
Okay, so, what are we           
  gonna make first?             
              We're gonna make  
              the sauté sauces  

268
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,672
                that we use     
           for our garlic wings.

269
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,541
       Start by just turning up 
               the fire.        

270
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:11,676
     Whoa!                      
              It's pretty hot.  

271
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:13,745
   Can't wear a little hair-care
    product and be around that. 

272
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:14,946
        Okay.                   
    So, hot oil.                

273
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:15,947
               STEVE: Hot oil.  

274
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,350
                Brown ginger,   
              into the hot oil. 

275
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,418
                   Garlic.      
    There we go.                

276
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,686
    Ground lemongrass.          

277
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:22,787
     Nice.                      

278
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:25,423
               And then we got  
             the ground onions. 

279
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:28,559
           And then we stir this
           for about 40 minutes.

280
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,162
 Who stands here for 40 minutes 
         and stirs this?        

281
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,964
       So, now                  
 it's sautéed down.             

282
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:34,499
        Got our own chili paste 
                 right here.    
        Okay.                   

283
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,968
                Chili flake.    
    Adding some heat right now. 
     Seriously.                 

284
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:38,169
           You got the habañero.

287
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,306
                    Okay.       
      You be...

00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:44,042

   Hoppin' Arrow.               

289
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:45,777
 So, what are you               
  gonna put in?                 
                    All of it.

            Then we're bringing 
               some more heat.  
    So hot.                     

292
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:50,514
             Thai chili pepper.

               Peanut butter.   
        Good old peanut butter. 

295
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:57,655
          Hoisin sauce.         
 Just give it a sweetness to it.

296
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:58,723
 And a little color.            

297
00:10:58,725 --> 00:10:59,791
     And then I'm gonna stir it.

298
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,192
        How long                
is this gonna cook down?        

299
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:03,928
      Let it cook for an hour   
   until the oils start boiling,

300
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,998
 and then let it simmer and get 
 all the flavor for a day or so.

301
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,933
 This stays in there            
     for a day?                 
                    Yep.

  gonna make next?              

303
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:11,803
         Wings. You got to look 
            at these suckers.   

304
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:13,872
        We prefer to use        
        the mid-thighs.         

305
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,941
       We got some garlic, salt,
            pepper, sugar.      

306
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:19,878
            Make sure we get    
         all the wings in there.

307
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,681
 Now we add the chili-oil sauté 
          we just made.         

308
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:24,548

but let me know how you like it.

328
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,115
               Get some ranch.  

329
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,917
                Garnish it      
           with some cilantros. 

330
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,056
          Oh, my gosh.          
                       Yeah.    

331
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,058
      A little bit of heat,     
          not too much.         

332
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:12,063
   Good amount of spice to it,  
      little bit of sweet,      

333
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,065
        just a little bit       
 of the crispiness on the skin. 

334
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,067
         They're tender.        
         They're juicy.         

335
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,269
    There's a lot of flavor,    
    a lot of depth of flavor.   

336
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:22,006
         I'm impressed.         

337
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:24,875
  Tell me that wing             
  is not the bomb.              

338
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,277
                  Oh, man.      
             That is excellent. 

339
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,612
                Not too spicy   
               on the outside,  

340
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,013
       but just the right amount
               of heat.         

341
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:30,347
       Really, really good wing.

342
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:33,084
         What's up next?        
      House special fried rice. 

343
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:35,553
     FIERI: Rocked out with     
  their dad's signature sausage 

344
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:36,488
       when we come back.       

345
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:40,058
          O-M-G in O.B.         

346
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,768
             FIERI:             
"Triple D" is in the Ocean Beach
   neighborhood of San Diego,   

347
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:53,238
           digging in           
     to the OB Noodle House,    

348
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:55,639
         a dream locale         
    for Steve and Kyle Yeng,    

349
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:58,509
       Chinese immigrants       
 with one heck of a back story. 

350
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:01,246
 My grandparents and my parents 
        both are Chinese.       

351
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:03,314
  They immigrated               
  down to Cambodia              

352
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:06,384
to escape the communists,       
 the war, and all that.         

353
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,185
  And life was good             
     for a while                

354
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:11,255
  until they got caught in the  
   whole Khmer Rouge genocide.  

355
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,958
  Which sent them to Thailand,  
 where their dad, Yaoshir Yeng, 

356
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,594
       used his signature       
         sausage recipe         

357
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,663
   to move the family to Cali.  

358
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:22,333
  Your dad really changed your  
 life, his life, everyone's life

359
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,734
       by making sausage.       
                   Mm-hmm.      

360
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:26,203
         And the savory links   
         have always had a home 

361
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,471
        in mom's family recipe. 

362
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,407
      House special fried rice. 
      Table three.              

363
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,676
    So, what do we have here?   
         Hand-diced pork butts. 

364
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,678
           Seriously?           
        Yeah, we actually do it 
                  by hand,      

365
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,813
        so that way there's     
   a little more texture to it. 

366
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:38,816
      We have a combination     
of salt and sugar and soy sauce.

367
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:41,952
      And what in the world     
            is this?            

368
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,088
This is the secret recipe.      

369
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:45,356
        I see star anise.       

370
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:47,225
        Tremendous amount       
         of star anise.         

371
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:48,292
             Clove.             

372
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:49,761
              Okay,             
        there's cinnamon.       
                   Uh-huh.      

373
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:51,495
         Anything else?         
        Sake.                   

374
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:53,163
          Sake? Really?         
     Yeah, sake.                

375
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,933
         It's been sitting here 
          for at least a year.  

376
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,769
    You got to wait like a year 
to a year and a half to use it. 
             Crazy.             

377
00:13:57,771 --> 00:14:00,037
 Different ingredients, and you 
    don't add too much of it.   

378
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:01,772
             It's pretty strong.

379
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:04,375
     And pretty much like that. 

380
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,576
      So, you mix this up.      

381
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:06,778
              You mix them up.  

382
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:09,247
       Put the casing onto      
 a little sausage stuffer there.

383
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:10,782
            You have            
     natural casings there.     

384
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:13,584
    Let's turn on               
    the machine.                

385
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,719
    There you go.               

386
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:15,787
                There you go.   

387
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:16,787
     All right.                 

388
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:19,123
          And you start         
      to pinch it off now.      

389
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,593
 Once you go ahead and make the 
 sausage, you're gonna tie it.  

390
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,060
         Take the wraps,        
         wrap it around?        
                   Mm-hmm.      

391
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:24,929
       And we just kind of poke 
          some holes in them    

392
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:27,265
           through this casing. 
           That'll let          
      some of the air out.      

393
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:29,733
     How do you preserve it?    
   By putting it in the oven -- 
                160 degrees.    

394
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,970
    Probably like a day or so,  
   just to get the moisture out.

395
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:36,708
 I have to just try this sausage
    'cause it's sitting here.   

396
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:42,480
          O-M-G in O.B.         

397
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:45,149
      It's got a richness,      
 a little bit on the sweet side,

398
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:48,219
       and awesome texture      
on the outside of it, chewiness.

399
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,954
   Well, that's a great start.  
     Now what are we making?    

400
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:52,556
          Right now we're doing 
    a house special fried rice. 
              Okay.             

401
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:53,491
             Fresh jasmine rice.

402
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,026
       And here's the seasoning 
               for rice.        

403
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:57,228
   You know, there's some salt, 
     some pepper, some garlic,  

404
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,697
   and put a little sauté sauce 
    that we just made earlier,  

405
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,633
              chopped sausage,  

406
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:03,434
           and here we also have
               jumbo shrimps    

407
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,436
       and some beef strip loins
           that we fried up.    

408
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,505
      Is there any marinade     
    on this meat or anything?   

409
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,107
           A little salt, sugar.

410
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,643
  Here's some Chinese broccoli  
 that we have to blanch in water

411
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:12,710
           really, really fast. 

412
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:13,844
              Put a little oil. 

413
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,179
             We have these eggs 
                 right here.    

414
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,716
It looks red because we actually
      mix it with Sriracha.     

415
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,852
             Chopped onions.    
         Now we put the rice in.

416
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:24,322
     Just constantly shaking it.
     Make sure it doesn't burn. 

417
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:25,456
         Can you feel the heat? 

418
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,457
           I can feel           
           the heat.            

419
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,992
         So, after it dries out 
              a little bit,     

420
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:31,862
       add the Chinese broccoli 
       that we blanched earlier.

421
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:34,298
           Put some green onion 
                 into it.       

422
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:36,200
             Put a little swirl 
             of our sesame oil  

423
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:37,368
               and just a dash  
                of soy sauce.   

424
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:39,003
           That's it?           

425
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,638
                 That's it.     

426
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,877
              Dude,             
      that is smoking hot.      

427
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:46,811
                 Yeah.          

428
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,548
      Cilantro.                 
    There you go.               

429
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,821
              Mmm.              

430
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:58,556
          All the rice          
          is separated.         

431
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:01,625
     You do get a little bit    
 of the heat from the Sriracha. 

432
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:03,293
                      Mm-hmm.   
  The sauté, also.              

433
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,897
  The sauté.                    

434
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:08,165
  But honestly,                 
  the sweetness of the sausage  

435
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:10,134
  just kind of marries          
  it all together.              

436
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:11,369
  Mmm.                          

437
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,271
                 All right.     

438
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:15,640
           All right, you guys. 

439
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,174
    I've got an order of house  
    special fried rice for you. 

440
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,309
  Every bite is full of flavor, 

441
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:20,110
    and you really can't get    
    the taste anywhere else.    

442
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,779
       The best fried rice      
    I've ever had, honestly.    

443
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:24,248
     I come here once a week    
  because the food's so great.  

444
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:32,122
  Really a pleasure.            
You guys are the best.          

445
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,190
         Hey, group hug.        

446
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,660
We're doing a team hug.         
   Very nice, guys.             

447
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,328
              Yeah!             

448
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:41,265
               Oh!              
   The OB Noodle House rocked.  

449
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,735
     So, listen, I still got    
 a little time left in the show.

450
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,470
         What do you say        
       when we come back,       

451
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:48,139
    we go for a little blast    
from the past here in San Diego?

452
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:50,174
    I feel like some Italian.   
        See you in a bit.       

453
00:16:57,384 --> 00:17:00,018
 So, here I am in the final leg 
      of my San Diego tour,     

454
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:02,686
        and like I said,        
 I'm feeling like some Italian, 

455
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:04,021
    but not just any Italian,   

456
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:07,024
       some really killer       
       thin-crust pizza.        

457
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:09,026
   So, there's only one place   
          for me to go,         

458
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:11,028
       and that's to visit      
       the newest location      

459
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,564
  of the "Triple D" favorite -- 
     This is Pizzeria Luigi.    

460
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:19,437
         It's my favorite pizza 
                in town.        

461
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,638
   Seriously?                   
                 Seriously.     

462
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,973
    WOMAN: It's fresh-baked.    

463
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:25,375
      The crust is amazing.     

464
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:26,878
 There's a lot of love into it. 
        It's really good.       

465
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,582
             FIERI:             
  And since our visit in '08... 

466
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:34,184
Oh, you gonna go round?         
     Little dance?              

467
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,255
  ..."Triple D" fans have given 
   Luigi Agostini so much love  

468
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:41,525
  that he opened a second joint 
  in an area called North Park, 

469
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:46,063
       expanding the menu       
   to 25 totally unique pies.   

470
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:47,531
           You tell your friends
               back in Italy    

471
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,467
       this is what kind of     
       pizza you're making,     
       what are they gonna say? 

472
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:51,436
They're gonna throw me          
    out of Italy.               
        They're gonna throw you 
                 out of Italy?  

473
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:53,738
      Until they try them.      

474
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,074
     'Cause who's gonna deny    
       a white, veggie pie      

475
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:59,009
   called "The Fresh Prince,"   

476
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:01,812
      a baked-potato style      
   called "The Sports Bar"...   

477
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:03,347
       This is                  
one of my favorites.            

478
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:08,286
  ...or a marinara meatball pie 
    called "The Crime Scene"?   

479
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:13,224
       But I'm here today       
 to get my Italian brother Luigi

480
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:14,959
    out of his comfort zone.    

481
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,827
     So, every time             
Luigi and I get together,       

482
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,362
we make some kind of            
    unique pizza.               

483
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:21,298
I want to think about what      
we can do for a pizza here,     

484
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:23,835
so let's take a little gander   
at some of your ingredients.    
                Sounds cool.    

485
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:28,572
   FIERI: I'm in the spicy mood 
            right now.          

486
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:30,708
              Got any hot sauce 
                around here?    

487
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,110
         Well,                  
I got some wing sauce.          

488
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:33,744
        This is the wing sauce? 
    Yes.                        

489
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:37,315
                    Whoa!       
             Look at that move. 

490
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,250
              Now, I like,      
         here at Pizzeria Luigi 

491
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,053
    how they take everything,   
 and it's in a nice big format, 

492
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:43,053
     but I want to chop this up.

493
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,121
                I want this     
           all to work together.

494
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:45,590
         So, pepperoni,         
         some sausage.          

495
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:48,559
     We'll grab some red onion, 
           some jalapeño.       

496
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,396
Are you done chopping,          
      or what?                  
                 Get it on.     

497
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:53,463
  All right. Sweet.             
                    Okay.       

498
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,465
      Meatball                  
on top of that, too?            

499
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:56,801
        There's meatball        
        on there, also.         

500
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:59,270
         Got to do some garlic. 
    Ready to go?                
  Let's get her in.             

501
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:00,804
          Oh, hang on.          
            Hang on.            

502
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,473
            It needs            
      some red chili flake.     

503
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,808
                We don't need   
              no stinking lid.

505
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:08,345
             What do you think? 
     Beautiful.                 

506
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:10,815
I think we're gonna kill        
somebody with this thing.       
             It's gonna be hot. 

507
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,350
                  Bye-bye.      
                Bye. See you.

Got to come up with a name.     

509
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,220
        What about something -- 
Something like "hot."           

510
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:17,288
                   <i> Diablo.</i>     

511
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,290
 I say<i> "El Diablo."</i>             

512
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:21,225
    Look at that.               
        Huh?                    
          That looks good, man. 

513
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,628
  Now, we have to appropriately 
  garnish it.                   

514
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:24,962
      A little bit of Sriracha. 

515
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:30,634
           A little wing sauce. 

516
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,236
Anybody wants to die?           

517
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:34,539
             Where's the cutter?

518
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:40,278
      Oh, boy.                  

519
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:43,547
         It's got a lot flavor. 

520
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,983
         Nice little vinegar    
     coming from the wing sauce.

521
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:47,051
                 Mmm.

             nice on top of it. 

523
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:50,721
       But I think the Sriracha 
          and the wing sauce,   

524
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,990
            the jalapeños,      
       all that coming together 

525
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,325
           gives it a little bit
                of a sting.     

526
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,726
                    Mmm.        
              I love the spice.

00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:30,695
     Good job, brother.         

546
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:34,398
          So, that's it         
       for this road trip.      

547
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:35,699
        But don't worry.        

548
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,969
    We got plenty more joints   
 to find all over this country. 

549
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:40,171
     I'll be looking for you    
            next time           

550
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:42,306
     on "Diners, Drive-Ins,     
           and Dives."          

551
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:43,707
                 Uh, hello.     

552
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:47,244
   Just so you know, I'm trying 
   to do an interview over here.

553
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:50,380
 But how about you come on back 
        and have a seat?        

554
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,650
           Yeah, you want to -- 
               Okay, great.     

555
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:55,052
         Well, it's really been 
               a pleasure.      

556
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,321
               See you later.   
                   Adiós.       

557
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:00,091
          BOY: A bug!           
   FIERI: Oh, a bug! [ Laughs ]
