00:00:01,202 --> 00:00:02,267
         Hey, everybody.        

2
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:03,736
         I'm Guy Fieri,         
      and we're rolling out     

3
00:00:03,738 --> 00:00:06,939
 looking for America's greatest 
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.  

4
00:00:06,941 --> 00:00:08,673
          This trip...          
                     Oh, boy.   

5
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,275
   ...we're getting stuffed...  

6
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:12,444
    Oh, yeah.                   
        ...and twisted...       

7
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:14,212
                 [ Laughs ]     

8
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:15,347
     ...in Jackson, Wyoming.    

9
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:16,882
                 Sports bar     
         with French onion soup.

10
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:18,417
            That's not something
             you see every day. 

11
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:21,820
     An all-American saloon     
    with Semper Fi spirit...    

12
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:23,155
             Don't ever call me 
                   a chef.      

13
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:26,291
       ...going way behind      
       rank-and-file food.      

14
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:27,492
                Gosh, I like    
              the way you roll. 

15
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:29,027
              Then,             
   in Monterey, California...   

16
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,096
I'm getting a little            
freaked out right now,          

17
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:32,964
     but I'll go                
 with what you got.             

18
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:34,099
...a family-run Italian joint...

19
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:35,234
      Nice job.                 
  Mom did it right.             

20
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:38,570
          ...where Mama         
     definitely knows best.     

21
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:41,639
We have a rule -- can't         
wear more bling than            
the host of the show.           

22
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:44,242
         And in Boston,         
        Massachusetts...        

23
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:45,444
    Look at that.               

24
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:46,978
           ...a funky           
     little sandwich shop...    

25
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,113
  It's outrageous.              

26
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:51,450
          ...putting on         
   a full-court panini press.   

27
00:00:51,452 --> 00:00:53,519
     Eating it?                 
I'm gonna devour it!            

28
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:55,587
     That's all right here,     
           right now,           

29
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:58,323
     on "Diners, Drive-ins,     
           and Dives."          

32
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:14,406
  I'm here in Jackson, Wyoming, 

33
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:17,008
          about a mile          
 from the downtown tourist area,

34
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,210
 and you know me on "Triple D." 

35
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:20,078
       I don't want to go       
     where the tourists go.     

36
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,081
          I want to go          
      where the locals eat,     

37
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:24,416
      and I hear the joint      
      you got to check out      

38
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,485
         is Sidewinders         
    American Grill & Tavern.    

39
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,890
       RICE: Carne asada.       

40
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:33,625
           Sidewinders          
     is all about the food.     

41
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:35,160
       Barbecue burger up.      

42
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:38,297
 It's fresh, it's homemade, and 
it's not trying to be too fancy.

43
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:41,366
   FIERI: Just like its owner,  
       ex-marine Joe Rice.      

44
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,101
              I'm not a chef.   
              I'm a line cook.  

45
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,303
            Just remember that. 
      Don't ever call me a chef.

46
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:48,907
       After flying jets,       
Joe landed in the restaurant biz

47
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:51,243
 and opened Sidewinders in '97, 

48
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:54,713
  naming it after the missiles  
     on an F-4 fighter jet.     

49
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:56,047
            Really a sports bar,
               American grill   

50
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,049
              with really good  
              home-driven food. 

51
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:00,251
         The French onion soup's
                 to die for.    

52
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:01,986
    RICE: French onion soup!    

53
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:03,255
This is my favorite soup to have
        when I come here.       

54
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:05,524
    I appreciate                
 French onion soup,             

55
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:07,659
and to find real-deal           
  French onion soup             

56
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,528
would be, like, epic.           

57
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:14,399
So, basically, we start         
with some butter, olive oil.    

58
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:15,733
 Let that caramelize            
    a little bit.               

59
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:20,672
We have Texas sweets,           
regular whites, red onions,     

60
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,608
       leeks.                   

61
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,210
Then we'll sweat these down     
  just translucent.             

62
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:26,678
   A little salt.               

63
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,747
   Little garlic.               

64
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:30,682
   Little pepper.               
      Shallots.                 

65
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,350
      Shallots have already been
                sweated down?   

66
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:35,220
 Yes. Little thyme.             
 Stir that all in.              

67
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:37,990
Add our sherry.                 
       That's really the kicker.

68
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:41,159
              A little bay leaf 
            and some beef stock?

69
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,294
                You're making   
            your own beef stock.

70
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:44,229
   Own beef stock.              

71
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:45,430
                  How long      
     will we let this cook down?

72
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:46,831
   About an hour.               

73
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:51,570
  First thing we do             
is we put a crostini in.        
                           Okay.

74
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:55,107
Just do a little of our --      
 the goodness, here.            

75
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:57,909
  Then a little --              
      Oh, boy.                  

76
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,177
                  Oh, boy.      

77
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,379
     [ Laughs ]                 

78
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:02,247
     You're gonna screw this up,
                 aren't you?    

79
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:03,848
     [ Laughs ]                 
   A little Gree.

                 [ Laughs ]     

81
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,986
I pride myself on not knowing   
the real way to say this.       

82
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:10,189
   You know what? I think that's
     good. I can't fly a plane. 

83
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:11,523
How do you say that?            
                       Gruyère. 

84
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,859
 Okay, thank you.               
              Yeah. [ Laughs ]  

85
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,994
We're gonna take this           
and put it in a Salamander.     

86
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:18,196
              To the Salamander 
            to melt the Gruyère.

87
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,397
     Right.                     
                         Okay.  

88
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,066
                 All right.     

89
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:23,735
                 Sports bar     
         with French onion soup.

90
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:26,004
            That's not something
             you see every day. 

91
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,074
               This is great,   
        great French onion, man.

92
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,276
     Thank you.                 

93
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:33,545
  All the discipline is correct.
            The crock makes it. 

94
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,080
     The way you cut the onions,
         the variety of onions, 

95
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:37,816
          and the sherry level's
                  perfect.      

96
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:38,950
         The salt level's right.

97
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,420
             The caramelization 
               isn't too far.   

98
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:44,355
         That's legit. Nice job.
Thank you.                      

99
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:47,425
  The beef broth is to die for. 

100
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:51,896
              MAN:              
  It's a great balance between  
  the crouton and the cheese.   

101
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,565
        Wonderful taste.        

102
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:59,371
 I love the food because there's
   such a variety on the menu.  

103
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:01,172
The Carne asada.                
                         Really?
      Yeah.                     

104
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,041
   WOMAN: Sidewinder pretzel.   

105
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:04,309
  I really love the "S" pretzel.
                It's so good.   

106
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,244
  When I was a kid,             

107
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,180
I had a business selling        
soft, New York-style pretzels.  

108
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:09,714
 Had a little cart.             
  My foundation --              

109
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:13,318
Now we give these carts away to 
non-profit kids' organizations. 

110
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,120
It's an all-American treat.     

111
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:17,456
     It's our number-one seller.
I can understand why.           

112
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,924
All right. Let's get into it,   
then. Give me the rundown.      

113
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,525
        We start with our yeast.

114
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,260
 We bloom the yeast.            

115
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,395
              Once it's set up, 
        we start with olive oil.

116
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:27,265
               A little salt.   
            Just a little honey.

117

 All-purpose flour?             

118
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:32,070
 Yeah, high-gluten, all-purpose.
            We'll pull this up. 

119
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:35,140
              Slowly add water. 

120
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:38,410
     Now we're gonna take it out
               and portion it.  

121
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:40,145
          Get it on sheet trays,

122
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:43,014
      put it in the refrigerator
        for two hours to proof. 

123
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:46,484
Then, when you're ready         
to make a pretzel...            

124
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,887
             Just cut it in half
             and put that aside.

125
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,089
            You just kind of go 
    with your hand a little bit.

126
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,424
And what can you get this       
    stuffed with?               

127
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:56,361
         You can get it stuffed 
     with mozzarella, pepperoni,

how he says "jalapeño."         

131
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,636
         Put a little mozzarella
                  in there.     

132
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,040
            We basically take it
              and just roll it.

             About five minutes.

  Little egg wash.              

225
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:45,489
             Okay. In the oven, 
               and that's it?   

226
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:47,659
    That's it.                  
   Six minutes.                 
                       Got it.  

227
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,397
                Look at that.   
           Good-looking pot pie.

228
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,835
     You know, there's something
     about chicken on the bone, 

229
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:58,102
              to make the stock 
               from the bone.   

230
00:08:58,104 --> 00:08:59,638
           There's such a depth.

231
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:03,241
  It's creamy. Love that you got
        the mushrooms in there. 

232
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:04,743
             Not a ton of crust.

233
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,912
        The veggies are tender, 
   but you get some real texture

234
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,180
            out of those carrots
               and the celery.  

235
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:11,583
                  Dynamite.     
    Thanks.                     

236
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:12,651
         Watch out for this guy.

237
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,051
              RICE:             
        Chicken pot pie.        

238
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,454
  There's a lot of really tasty 
      things inside of it.      

239
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:19,190
  MAN: It's creamy, has a great 
   crunch on the crust up top.  

240
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,792
          It's hearty.          
          It's great.           

241
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:23,995
This is a destination           
restaurant. You do              
want to come here.              

242
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:25,664
 Just a wonderful place to come.

243
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,134
             You named the joint
                 Sidewinders    

244
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:30,602
               after something  
 that was so major in your life,

245
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:32,336
                being a pilot   
            in the Marine Corps.

246
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,538
      So I could understand why,

247
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,473
  when you're gonna do something
               to that degree,  

248
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:38,343
          you're gonna make sure
          that the food has that
          much respect, as well.

249
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:39,611
                   And you      
         really have shown that.

250
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:41,479
        That's not typically    
  what you find in a sports bar.

251
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:42,480
                 Nice job, Joe. 
Thank you.                      

252
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:44,482
               Really nice job. 
  Thank you.                    

253
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:47,952
       FIERI: Coming up...      
   Got a lot                    
to be proud of, girl.           

254
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,887
       ...an Italian spot       
   in Monterey, California...   

255
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,824
This is, without question,      

256
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:55,159
one of the craziest minestrones 
   I've ever seen.              

257
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:58,296
     ...that's taking pride     
     in staying homegrown.      

258
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:00,298
That's the example of lasagna   
like your mom used to make.     

259
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:10,474
          So, I'm here          
    in Monterey, California,    

260
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:12,544
      known for Cannery Row     
      and awesome seafood.      

261
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:14,545
  Well, I'm in the locals area, 
          I'm downtown,         

262
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,748
      to check out a joint      
     that the locals love --    

263
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,083
          an old-school         
    family-run Italian joint.   

264
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,952
        This is Rosine's.       

265
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,356
        Angel hair pasta.       

266
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:26,358
   We're down two or three times
                 every week.    

267
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,559
                   This is      
        our favorite restaurant.

268
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:29,494
        Chicken Parmesan.       

269
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:30,629
  I don't like it.              
     I love it.                 

270
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,631
           It's better          
   than my Sicilian grandma's.  

271
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,432
             Wow. Someone's out 
                of the will.    

272
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:37,368
 FIERI: Authentic Italian's been
      headlining this joint     

273
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,504
           since 1980,          
when Chef Jim Culcasi's parents,

274
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:42,707
         Jim and Rosine,        
    made it a family affair.    

275
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:45,710
    Everything is absolutely    
    amazing. I've never had     
    a bad meal here.            

276
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:47,779
            Lasagna.            

277
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:50,715
And the lasagna, with the layers
   of stuff, it's really nice.  

278
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:52,317
     Okay, let's                
get into making this.           

279
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,785
 We are making our Jim's special
       filling for our lasagna. 

280
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,988
 Your who?                      
              Jim's special --  
              my father's name. 

281
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,990
Did he make this, or your mom   
made this for your dad?         

282
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,725
             My mom for my dad. 
That's beautiful.               

283
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:03,661
All right, fire it up, man.     
                 All right.     
    We start off with olive oil.

284
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,463
               Then we drop in  
              our ground chuck. 

285
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,867
We're all browned up.           
      Next up?                  

286
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:12,737
             Onions. Mushrooms. 
                  Oregano.      

287
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:13,872
 Granulated garlic.             

288
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:15,206
                Sweet basil.    

289
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,209
               Touch of salt.   
                 And pepper.    

290
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,010
              We let this cook. 
     and then we add the nutmeg.

291
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,880
           And then the spinach.

292
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:24,749
All that is gonna work as       
the layering inside the lasagna.
                           Yes. 

293
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:28,086
Next up?                        
            We're going to build
                the lasagna.    

294
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:29,687
      Together.                 

295
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:33,558
 We start off with our red sauce
               on the bottom.   

296
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,563
                Pasta sheets.   
       And then go with ricotta.

297
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:39,631
               Jim's special.   

298
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:42,633
          Next, Parmesan cheese.
Parm.                           

299
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:44,568
                Jack cheese.    
    Jack?                       

300
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,305
                    Jack.       
                 More sauce.    

301
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,507
  How many layers?              
                         Four.  
    [ Whistles ]                

302
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:53,311
  Off in the oven               
   at what temp?                
               350 for an hour. 

303
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:55,046
Bring it out, let it cool.      

304
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,148
                Let it cool.    

305
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:00,651
                There we go.    

306
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,653
               Sauce the top.   

307
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,190
          Little Parmesan cheese
                and parsley.    

308
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:06,558
                There we go.    

309
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:13,397
    This has got                
  multiple layers.              

310
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,801
Super rich and thick.           
Tender pasta. Creamy.           

311
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:19,136
  All the balance.              

312
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:22,207
That's the example of lasagna   
like your mom used to make.     

313
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:25,476
Jimbo, nice job, man.           
Nice job. Mom did it right.     
                   She sure did.

314
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:28,413
  All right. Here you guys go.  
      Here's your lasagna.      

315
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:31,082
  It's like the perfect amount  
       of meat and cheese.      

316
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:34,218
            How's that lasagna? 
       It's as big as your head.

317
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,553
   It is enormous,              
and it is incredibly tasty.     

318
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:38,089
    Ultimate burger, reuben.    
           Table six!           

319
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,359
How long you worked here?       
         All my life, basically.
                 Since 1980.    

320
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,294
Your mom's place?               
              My mom's, Rosine. 

321
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:45,496
Is your mom Italian?            
        Yes. Sicilian, actually.

322
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,365
             FIERI:             
    And if you time it right,   

323
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,967
   you'll catch Rosine herself  
   helping out in the kitchen.  

324
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,502
  This is definitely a family.  

325
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,638
You couldn't get any more family
           than this.           

326
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,307
    They're always walking      
    around to make sure you     
    got everything you want.    

327
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:59,644
    You're gonna get            
    a wonderful home-cooked     
    meal, wonderful portion.    

328
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,112
              MAN:              
     Here's your minestrone.    

329
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,447
       Tell me                  
about the minestrone.           

330
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,581
          Minestrone's          
         off the charts.        

331
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:08,253
The minestrone soup is          
one of the locals' favorites.   

332
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:10,188
              We're gonna make  
            our minestrone soup.
Okay.                           

333
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,124
        We start with top round.

334
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,859
   Do we get hot?               

335
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:17,128
           No. We start it cold.
                   Watch.       

336
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,664
I'm getting a little            
freaked out right now, but      
I'll with what you got.         

337
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:20,865
               Dry red beans.   

338
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:22,533
              Granulated garlic 
                 and onion.     
  Hold on.                      

339
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:25,736
    How many cups               
of granulated onion and garlic? 
                     A lot.     

340
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,872
                   Sugar.       

341
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:31,008
                  Oregano.      
                Sweet basil.    

342
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,144
                Black pepper.   
                 Bay leaves.    

343
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,413
                White pepper.   
                Tomato paste.   

344
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:36,947
                 Beef base.     

345
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,082
             Then we add water. 
 Okay.                          

346
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,354
             We give it a stir. 
                 Here we go.    

347
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:46,357
      And then we add our diced 
  tomatoes and our tomato sauce.

348
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:50,495
This is, without question,      

349
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:53,097
one of the craziest minestrones 
   I've ever seen.              

350
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:55,099
 No other veggies.              
                        No, no. 

351
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:56,834
         This is the first part.
This is the beginning.          

352
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,237
          This is the beginning.
Okay, don't rush the song.      

353
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,773
       We're gonna let this cook
          for about four hours. 
Four hours.                     

354
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:03,641
     Now we're ready to pull out
                all the beef.   

355
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,910
        Okay.                   

356
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:07,578
                 All right.     
         Just put it on the pan.

357
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,579
             All the beef's out.

358
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,381
You let this cool down          
before you shred it.            

359
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:11,515
                  Exactly.      

360
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,518
             Next step will be, 
               we add celery.   

361
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,520
                  Carrots.      

362
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,922
                  Zucchini.     

363
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:20,058
                   Onions.      
                And cabbage.    

364
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,260
I like where this is            
going. How much longer          
you gonna let this cook?        

365
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,996
 Till the vegetables are tender.
               About an hour.   

366
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:27,131
                There we go.    

367
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:30,668
You take all this meat now,     
   shred it...                  
                  Shred it, yes.

368
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,536
...and throw it back in.        

369
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,671
  All right, Jimmy,             
     dish it up.                

370
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:35,807
             A little pasta in. 
  Okay.                         

371
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:38,343
So, I like the pasta's not      
floating in the pot thing,      

372
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:39,878
     'cause that                
always drives me nuts.          

373
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,349
          And then we top it off
          with Parmesan cheese. 

374
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,185
              Start your meal.  

375
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,160
 I love the cabbage             
      in there.                 

376
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:57,361
 The shredded beef,             

377
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,597
  not something you             
typically find in minestrone.   

378
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,369
 A nice, rich broth.            
I mean, the whole thing.        
                         Great. 

379
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:06,570
It's delicious. But I           
want to call the real boss in.  

380
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,372
       Rosine,                  
 are you back there?            

381
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,841
      Now, this                 
  is the authority.             

382
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,376
    You got a lot               
to be proud of, girl.           

383
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,846
Very nice to meet you.          
    Well, thank you, Guy.       
    Very nice to meet you.      

384
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:16,380
Look at her. To the nines --    
the hair, the bling.            

385
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,715
   We have a rule               

386
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:20,584
that you can't wear more bling  
than the host of the show.      

387
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,386
   Oh, my gosh!                 
                      [ Laughs ]

388
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:23,454
        JIM: Minestrone!        

389
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:24,922
         MAN: Can't wait        
    to get it in your mouth.    

390
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,658
    As soon as you taste it,    
    you know that it's          
    absolutely homemade.        

391
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,193
             MAN #2:            
    Here's your lamb shanks.    

392
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:31,328
 Young Man: It feels like home. 
   You get good, cooked food.   

393
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,797
 It's real hearty, fills you up.

394
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,132
  Come down Friday.             

395
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:37,468
That's when she's here          
  making the cakes.             

396
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,237
        Oh, I'll make you       
     a pie you won't forget.    

397
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,741
         FIERI: Up next,        
   in Boston, Massachusetts...  

398
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:45,743
 It's gonna be okay.            
We're jumping together.         

399
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:49,013
     ...a neighborhood joint    
       stuffing supper...       
The bird is the word.           

400
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:51,382
       ...into sandwiches.      
Rock-star sandwich.             
   Delicious.                   

401
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,058
     So, I'm here at Boston     

402
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,394
    in front of a "Triple D"    
 original -- Mike's City Diner. 

403
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:05,396
               All right, Jay,  
         what do you got for me?
You're in the wrong place.      

404
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:07,598
 Around the corner,             
across the hospital.            

405
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,667
Great gourmet sandwiches.       
      The bomb.                 

406
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,235
                You the man.    
                   Thanks.      

407
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:15,707
           This is it.          
         This is Blunch.        

408
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:22,213
      One beef ready to go.     

409
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:23,681
      Serving up sandwiches     

410
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:26,884
     has been job number one    
     for Chef Nikki Christo     

411
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:30,020
       since she opened up      
 this funky little space in '07.

412
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,889
How many square feet            
  you have here, 6?             

413
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:33,758
                Uh, no, 400.    
    400.                        

414
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:36,827
              Here's the loaf.  

415
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,163
WOMAN: I've pretty much had     
everything on the menu,         

416
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,131
 and I've never had             
 a bad thing here.              

417
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:41,499
          Her concept?          

418
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,168
 Serving a great, savory dinner 
  between two slices of bread.  

419
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,171
    My favorite is meat loaf.   

420
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,106
  She makes her own roast beef. 

421
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,108
  The bird is probably my go-to 
   sandwich when I come here.   

422
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,245
The first one we're making      
    is the bird.                
                            Yep.

423
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:56,180
We're gonna start with boneless,
        skinless chicken breast 

424
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,115
        with a little olive oil.

425
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:58,449
                Dried basil.    

426
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:00,451
 Granulated garlic?             
                 That's correct.

427
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:03,320
                Black pepper.   
   A blend of Italian seasoning.

428
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:06,591
              Granulated onion. 
             Little kosher salt.

429
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:09,259
     A little bit of lemon juice
                  in here.      

430
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:11,195
       Finish it off with water.

431
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,197
Poaching the chicken.           
                        Correct.

432
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:17,334
             In the oven we go. 
What temp?                      

433
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:21,004
                 375 degrees    
   for about 45 to 50 minutes --

434
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:23,874
           until it reaches 165.

435
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,745
             We chill overnight 
       so we get a better slice.

436
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:33,351
         Give it a little slice.
    There we go.                
    Little slice.               

437
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:35,819
         All right, so, now     
         we're gonna add some   
         of the artichoke aioli.

438
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,688
                  Next are      
      the oven-roasted tomatoes.

439
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,224
                  A little      
             mozzarella cheese. 

440
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,493
  We're gonna throw some of that
         nice chicken in there. 

441
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:43,628
        Okay.                   

442
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,163
                And now we're   
             gonna press her up.

443
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:51,202
      Now we're gonna finish it 
     with some nice baby greens.

444
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:56,107
            And that's the bird.

445
00:17:57,643 --> 00:18:00,978
Don't hold your breath.         
 It's gonna be okay.            

446
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,347
We're jumping together.         
                           Okay.

447
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,188
 Mmm.                           
         Glad, you're eating it.

448
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,923
    "Eating it"?!               
Geez, I'm gonna devour it.      

449
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,926
  A great sandwich.             

450
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:17,662
It's the roast chicken dinner   
on really good bread.           

451
00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:18,796
It's all house-made.            

452
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:19,997
     That rocks.                

453
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:22,266
                     Awesome.   
The bird is the word.           

454
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,734
 Awesome job, Nikki.            

455
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:26,537
               I got two birds  
                ready to fly.   

456
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,138
      MAN: Let me tell you      
  a little bit about the bird.  

457
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,540
        The meat is like        
    a little slice of heaven.   

458
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:31,409
    The vegetables are fresh.   

459
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,477
  I love the roasted tomatoes.  

460
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:34,612
     It's pretty taste-ado.     

461
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,080
 Nikki knows everybody by name. 

462
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:39,684
       One meltdown for Claudia.
              For you, Vincent. 

463
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:42,019
     I thought I was special    
  'cause she'd say, "Hi, Bob,"  

464
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:44,088
      and then I realized,      
    no, she knows everybody.    

465
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:47,024
     The Provencal for you, Bob.
   When someone says "Blunch,"  

466
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:49,827
   the first thing that comes   
to mind is a Provencal sandwich.

467
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:52,430
     The Provencal is one       
     of the many vegetarian     
     sandwiches on the menu     

468
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:54,031
    which I am a sucker for.    

469
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:58,636
              We're gonna make  
               the Provencal.   
Let's make it happen.           

470
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,104
               We're gonna add  
               the goat cheese  

471
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:02,373
         that we whip here with 
    a little bit of light cream.

472
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,509
           Then we're gonna take
           a fresh-basil pesto. 

473
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,911
                We also puree   
         our own kalamata olives

474
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,047
                  with some     
         extra virgin olive oil.

475
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:12,717
               Fresh tomatoes.  

476
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:14,785
     Quartered artichoke hearts.

477
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:17,387
      The oven-roasted tomatoes.

478
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,657
            Pop it on the press.

479
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,859
             We're gonna finish 
             with baby greens.  

480
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:24,528
    Personally --               
 I like the name --             

481
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,197
I would have called this        
  "Hippie Picnic."              

482
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:27,731
              A Hippie Picnic.  

483
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:31,202
It's the best name for          
a sandwich in the world.        

484
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:33,404
    Look at that.               

485
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,479
        Mmm.                    
      Oh, yeah.                 

486
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:44,949
That richness of the goat cheese
really carries a long way.      

487
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:46,483
  But then you have             
the roasted tomatoes,           

488
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:49,086
and you have the artichoke      
hearts, which have              
great texture to them.          

489
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:50,755
 The fresh tomatoes,            
the brightness from that.       

490
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:53,824
And then the key to it is having
that super-hot panini --        

491
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:55,826
really delivers the crunch      
   on the outside               

492
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:58,696
and the fresh greens            
   going into it.               

493
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:01,098
It's outrageous. I mean, it's   
really a delicious sandwich.    

494
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,700
        Mmm.                    

495
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,302
               Two Provencals   
                 coming up.     

496
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:08,172
    Every bite is just          
    like a kaleidoscope that    
    opens up in your mouth.     

497
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:10,641
                   FIERI:       
         So, I see what happens.

498
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:13,778
        You have one of the most
        successful "Triple D"   
        joints ever in Boston,  

499
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,513
          and you come looking  
          for the owner, and    
          he's down here eating.

500
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:17,715
              This is our boy,  
                  Jay Hajj.     

501
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,584
     You're the one that sent me
           down here to Blunch. 

502
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:22,052
I got to tell you,              
she's so creative.              
The food is awesome.            

503
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,388
 MAN: Nikki makes it with love, 
and it's just a whole experience

504
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,991
       when you come here       
   to have a Blunch sandwich.   

505
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:30,795
I look at "Provencal."          
That doesn't say "Buy me."      

506
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:34,999
I look at "Hippie Picnic."      
Says, "I'm in it to win it."    

507
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:36,334
             CHRISTO: "Buy me." 
Yeah.                           

508
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:38,202
 Rock-star sandwich.            
    Delicious.                  
        It's good. Thank you.   

509
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:43,407
     So, that's it for this
