 IN KANSAS CITY WANT.           

99
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:04,576
THAT'S JUST PERFECT.            
            BRISKET.            

100
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:05,844
                      HOW IS IT?
FANTASTIC.                      

101
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,112
             VERY SMOKY, TENDER.

        EVERY BITE THAT YOU TAKE
           IS INCREDIBLY GOOD.  

103
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:12,050
   <i> AND IF THAT AIN'T ENOUGH,</i>   

104
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:14,319
   <i> FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE,</i>   
    <i> WE'RE ONLY HALFWAY HOME.</i>   

105
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:16,721
   BURNT ENDS IS MY FAVORITE.   
                BURNT END PLATE.

106
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,725
              THAT'S THE EPITOME
                 OF BRISKET.    
    OKAY, THAT'S BRISKET        
THAT'S BEEN ON FOR 12 HOURS.    

107
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:23,061
              MAN.              
WE'LL SEPARATE THE POINT        
    FROM THE FLAT...            

108
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:25,196
             RIGHT.             
SO WE CAN GET MORE SPICE        
  DOWN TO THAT POINT.           

109
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:28,466
          RESEASON IT.          
PUT IT BACK ON FOR              
 4 HOURS AT 225.                

110
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,134
       TIME TO PULL 'EM.        
YEP.                            

111
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,337
          LET'S DO IT.          
      SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO NOW
        IS CUT IT INTO CHUNKS.  

112
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:35,741
    WHEN I SPLIT THAT POINT OFF 
   THE FLAT, I KEPT THE AU JUS, 

113
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:37,875
   AND WE'RE GONNA ADD SOME RUB 
          TO THAT AU JUS        

114
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:40,279
       AND PUT THOSE BURNT ENDS 
         RIGHT BACK IN THERE.   

115
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:42,680
       THEN WE'RE GONNA PUT 'EM 
       RIGHT BACK ON THE PLATE. 

116
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,950
        NOW THAT'S A KANSAS CITY
         BURNT END RIGHT THERE. 
     IS THAT HOW IT COMES?      

117
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:47,285
         THAT'S HOW WE SERVE IT.
    I'VE HAD SOME BURNT ENDS    
           IN MY DAY.           

118
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:49,554
           THAT'D BE            
        IN MY TOP THREE.        
                      ALL RIGHT.

119
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:52,023
THIS IS WHAT THE BARBECUE MAN   
WOULD HAVE SAVED FOR HIMSELF.   
           OH, YEAH.            

120
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:54,226
  THIS IS THE PART              
THE CHEF'S GONNA EAT.           

121

  PERFECT FINISH.               
         NOT TOO SWEET,         
         NOT TOO SALTY,         

122
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:58,696
      MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH.

  WITH FRIES.

          THE TURKEY SANDWICH.  
    <i> THAT'S BEEN ON THE MENU</i>    
        <i> SINCE DAY ONE.</i>         

130
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:17,982
                  IT'S AMAZING. 

131
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:20,452
WHAT PTERODACTYL POULTRY        
        IS THAT?                

132
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:23,688
       WHOLE TOM TURKEY BREAST, 
       SKIN ON. COMES IN FROZEN.

133
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:25,990
       IT'S THAWED OUT ENOUGH   
     THAT WE CAN APPLY THE RUB, 

134
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,460
         AND IT'LL STICK TO IT. 
  WHY AREN'T WE GONNA           
THAW IT OUT ALL THE WAY?

      AND LET IT COOK ALL NIGHT 

136
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:33,198
        AND NOT HAVE TO GET UP  
     BEFORE 3:00 IN THE MORNING.
REALLY?                         

137
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,667
THERE'S SCIENCE TO IT.          
         OKAY, WE'RE GONNA APPLY
          THE RUB ALL OVER THIS,

138
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,736
                JUST LIKE WE DID
                  THE BRISKET.  
THAT'S IT?                      

139
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:39,204

NO BRINING?                     

140
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,473
                     NO BRINING.
POULTRY LOVES                   
TO BE BRINED.                   

141
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,875
        THAT'S TRUE IF YOU HAVE 
      A PROBLEM KEEPING IT MOIST

142
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:45,677
    THROUGH THE COOKING PROCESS.
OH.                             

143
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:47,812
OKAY. ON TO THE SMOKER.

           TURKEY'S MY FAVORITE.

145

  HOW LONG'S THIS GONNA GO ON?  
10 TO 12 HOURS, 225.            

146
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:55,220
          SEMI-FROZEN.          
SEMI-FROZEN.                    

147
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:57,422
     MMM. TELL ME YOU DON'T     
        WANT TO JUST PICK       

148
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,690
   AT THAT CHUNK RIGHT THERE.   
         I'M CALLING THAT PIECE.

149
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:03,495
      ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.      
         I'M STARVING.          
 OKAY, WE'VE LET THE TURKEY REST
     FOR 15 TO 20 MINUTES.      

150
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:06,230
          NOW PULL THE SKIN OFF.
         LOOK AT THAT.          
YOU SEE THE PINK COLOR ON THERE?

151
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,233
    PEOPLE GET SCARED,          
THINKING IT'S UNDERCOOKED.      

152
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,435
THAT THING'S BEEN COOKING       
      FOR 12 HOURS.             

153
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:14,306
  THAT PINK IS PERFECT. THAT'S  
GONNA HAVE A NICE SMOKED FLAVOR.
     THAT'S NOT DRY AT ALL.     

154
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:16,307
        LOOK AT THE BARK        
         ON THE OUTSIDE.        

155
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:17,843
     THAT'S NOT SKIN, FOLKS.    

156
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:21,446
   WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA ADD SOME
   AU JUS TO THESE PIECES, TOO. 

157
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,782
 YOU CAN'T MAKE IT ANY BETTER,  
            CAN YA?             
                       OH, YEAH.

158
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:26,250
     I'M GONNA ADD A LITTLE RUB 
           TO THE AU JUS,       

159
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:28,519
          SQUEEZE ALL THE JUICE 
        WE CAN OUT OF THAT SKIN,

160
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,989
    STIR THAT UP, LET IT RUN    
RIGHT OVER IT AND SOAK RIGHT IN.

161
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:33,458
     THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER LAYER
              OF FLAVOR.        
         WE NEED THAT.          

162
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:36,128
 MAN, THAT'S JUST PERFECT.      
IT'S JUICY. IT'S FLAVORFUL.     

163
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:38,397
IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER       
       THAN THAT.               
          I'VE SMOKED           
       A LOT OF TURKEYS.        

164
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,132
    I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING   
          GOING ON HERE

VERY TASTY.                     
       (woman) IT'S A BOB THING.

195
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,268
A BOB THING?                    
        EVERYTHING GOOD?        

196
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,203
  <i> THAT'D BE BOB PALMGREN...</i>    
FULL BABY BACKS.                

197
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:54,873
 <i> A HIGH-END CHEF WHO PICKED UP</i> 
     <i> BARBECUING AS A HOBBY,</i>    

198
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,275
      <i> THEN TRIED HIS HAND</i>      
    <i> AT A LITTLE COMPETITION.</i>   

199
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:59,544
  YOU WERE COOKING FOR THE ROYAL
        HERE IN KANSAS CITY     

200
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:02,413
         BEFORE IT WAS EVEN AT  
      THE AMERICAN ROYAL CENTER.
YEAH. UH-HUH.                   

201
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:05,350
                            WOW.
      <i> A COUPLE OF DECADES</i>

 <i> HE TOOK HIS HOBBY FULL TIME.</i>  

203
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:10,021
BOB BRINGS THE CHEF             
    INTO THIS.                  

204
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:12,891
    HE THINKS                   
OUTSIDE THE BOX.                
       JALAPEÑO SAUSAGES.       

205
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,561
           WONDERFUL.           
     COOKED IN A CORN HUSK.     
                  FLAVORFUL,    
               CHUNKS OF PEPPER.

206
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:19,965
   ALL RIGHT, BROTHER,          
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NOW?       
           NOW WE NEED TO GRIND 
              SOME PORK UP      

207
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,766
               FOR THE SMOKED   
             JALAPEÑO SAUSAGES. 

208
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:24,102
NICE BIG PORK BUTT,             
     BONE-IN.                   
                            YEP.

209
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:25,904
          PORK BUTTS ARE PERFECT
               FOR SAUSAGES.    

210
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,106
PACKED WITH THEIR OWN FAT.      
                   THAT'S RIGHT.

211
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,907
WE'RE JUST CUTTING THIS         
       IN STRIPS                

212
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:32,176
SO WE'LL BE ABLE TO FEED IT     
      NICE AND EASY.            
                      THAT'S IT.

213
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,379
BUFFALO CHOPPER ON ONE SIDE,    
   GRINDER ON THE OTHER.        
                           YEAH.

214
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:35,913
OH.                             
              LOVE IT, DON'T YA?

215
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:38,183
SO THE IDEA HERE IS TO KEEP     
    THE EQUIPMENT COLD,         

216
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,452
KEEP THE MEAT COLD, SO THAT FAT 
    DOESN'T GUM UP ON YOU.      

217
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:42,387
GROUND PORK BUTT.               
         A LITTLE BIT OF NUTMEG,

218
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:44,389
      FRESH GARLIC GOES IN THERE
           CHOPPED UP, SALT.    

219
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:46,791
        THIS IS KIND OF LIKE    
     A BRATWURST SAUSAGE RECIPE.

220
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,194
   CAYENNE PEPPER, GROUND PEPPER
        AND THEN ALLSPICE,      

221
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,861
       SOME JALAPEÑOS DICED UP, 

222
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:53,131
   GOT A LITTLE SUGAR TO SWEETEN
    LIFE UP A LITTLE BIT HERE,  

223
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,799
              DICED RED PEPPERS.
NICE COLOR.                     

224
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,935
    LITTLE CHRISTMAS LOOK THERE,
              YOU KNOW.         

225
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,069
                  CHICKEN BASE. 

226
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,138
                AND THEN WE GET 
               TO HAVE THE FUN. 

227
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,073
                 WE LIKE TO USE 
                 OUR HANDS HERE.

228
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:04,342
    THEN YOU GOT YOUR CORN HUSK.
   SOAKED IN                    
A LITTLE WATER.                 

229
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,277
HOLDS MOISTURE IN               
  FOR A TAMALE,                 

230
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,147
BUT IT'LL LET SMOKE THROUGH     
       FOR SAUSAGE.             
                AND KEEPS       
        YOUR SAUSAGE MOIST, TOO.

231
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,949
        WE TAKE ABOUT 6 OUNCES. 

232
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:13,018
              PUT THAT IN THERE 
              LIKE I GOT THERE. 

233
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:15,419
   THEN WE'RE GONNA ROLL IT UP. 
       TWIST EACH END HERE.     

234
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,822
  IF YOU'LL DO ME THE HONORS, I 
 JUST NEED YOU TO TIE ME A KNOT.

235
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,358
             THERE YOU GO.      
       ONE MORE PIECE OF STRING.
NOW LONG IS THIS GONNA          
GO DOWN IN THE SMOKER?          

236
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,760
          THIS IS GONNA TAKE    
       ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF.

237
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,362
  AND THE GOOD THING ABOUT THIS 

238
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,564
          IS YOU CAN LEAVE IT IN
             FOR THREE HOURS--  

239
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:28,232
              UNBELIEVABLE--    
           AT A LOW TEMPERATURE,

240
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:30,435
         AND IT'LL JUST KEEP ON 
            TAKING SMOKE ON.    

241
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,903
                 NOW WE'RE GONNA
                  PLATE 'EM UP. 
     LOOK AT THAT.              
WE GOT JALAPEÑOS PLUS.          

242
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,706
      THIS SHOULD POP RIGHT OUT.
IT WORKS.                       

243
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:37,108
      YEAH. GOT THE JALAPEÑOS   
   AND THE PEPPERS, GREAT STUFF.

244
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,244
               SLICE IT UP HERE.
LOOK AT THE SMOKE RING.         
LOOK AT ALL THE JUICE.          

245
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,980
                       OH, YEAH.
MMM.                            

246

    IT'S SUPER TENDER.          
IT DID GET THE SMOKE. MMM.      

247
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,385
       IT WENT LONG ENOUGH      
THAT THE JALAPEÑOS MELLOWED OUT.

248
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:49,587
I'M GONNA POLITELY TELL YOU     
      THAT I WILL BE

      SAUSAGE IDEA.

LEGALLY BORROWED.

252
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,663
     IT'S A GREAT COMBINATION,  
   THE SAUSAGE AND THE JALAPEÑO.

253
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,732
IT'S TREMENDOUS. IT JUST        
CRUMBLES IN YOUR MOUTH.         

254
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:03,868

        VERY GOOD.

I DON'T KNOW THAT I SEE LAMB    
RIBS ON MANY BARBECUE MENUS.    

264
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,422
                 WELL,          
      THEY'RE A LITTLE DELICATE.

265
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,691

         YOU DON'T OVERCOOK 'EM.
GET IT GOING, BOSS.

OKAY.

                SALT, BASIL,    
             REGULAR CANE SUGAR.

269
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,768
        GOT TO HAVE CHILI POWDER
                IN A RUB.       
A WHOLE MESS OF IT.             

270
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:38,369
                    YOU GOT IT. 

271
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:40,572
 THIS IS OUR VEGETARIAN CHICKEN 
  BASE JUST FOR THE HECK OF IT. 

272
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:42,840
                AND THEN WE GOT 
               OUR GROUND CUMIN.
      HE'S LIKE

  LAST TIME I SAW               
SOMETHING LIKE THAT             

276
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:51,049
WAS WHEN WE WERE

                       OH, OKAY.

           THAT'S OUR LAMB RIBS.

302
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:50,108
THESE LOOK MORE LIKE            
A SPARE RIB LAMB RIB.           
                          RIGHT.

303
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,443
 THEY CALL 'EM DENVER LAMB RIBS.
   IT'S THE WAY THEY CUT 'EM.   

304
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:55,447
BUT THEY ARE COMING

'CAUSE I'M PETITE               
   LIKE A LAMB.                 

306
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,051

00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,988
   AND WE JUST CUT THROUGH 'EM. 
      PUT A LITTLE PRESSURE.    

309
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:06,924
   LOOK AT HOW IT JUST          
FALLS RIGHT OFF THE BONE.       
           OH, YEAH. IT'S SWEET.

DOESN'T OVERPOWER IT.           

313
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,666
          IT SITS THERE         
  AND JUST KIND OF SUPPORTS IT. 

314
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,868
  YOU STILL GET

            SMOKED CHICKEN,     
       I COULD EAT IT EVERY DAY.

483
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:46,591
  (man) BEST BURNT END SANDWICH 
           I EVER HAD,          

484
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:49,793
        AND I DON'T CARE        
 IF I GET IT ON MY FACE OR NOT. 
THE BABY BACK RIB.              

485
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:51,461
HOW ARE THE RIBS?               
                      FANTASTIC.

486
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:53,731
  THE RUB IS EXCELLENT, UNLIKE  
  WHAT I'VE EVER TASTED BEFORE. 

487
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,133
          <i> 'CAUSE IT'S</i>          
    <i> A WOODYARD ORIGINAL...</i>     
      IT MAY BE                 
A TRADE SECRET, ACTUALLY.       

488
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:59,537
   <i> CRANKED OUT BY PIT MASTER</i>   
        <i> MARK O'BRYAN.</i>          
COMING ALONG NICELY.            

489
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:02,406
      SO WHAT'S THE RUNDOWN HERE
         FOR THIS MAGICAL RUB?  
IT'S QUITE UNIQUE.              

490
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,141
WE START OFF WITH...            
               IS THAT TURMERIC?

491
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:05,876
TURMERIC.                       
      I'M IN KANSAS CITY, RIGHT?

492
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:07,611
YES, YOU ARE.                   
  SEA SALT.                     
                  A LITTLE SALT.

493
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,346
CARDAMOM.                       
            CARDAMOM. SERIOUSLY?

494
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:11,348
       SERIOUSLY.               
CLOVE, GRANULATED GARLIC,       

495
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:12,483
CAYENNE PEPPER...               
                      (whistles)

496
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:14,285
AND LAST, LEMON PEPPER.         

497
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,687
THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST PECULIAR
      RUBS I'VE EVER SEEN.      

498
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:20,224
    CARDAMOM, CLOVE AND TURMERIC
          IN KANSAS CITY...     
MM-HMM.                         

499
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:21,425
                  ON PORK RIBS? 

500
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:22,960
                       NO SUGAR?
NO SUGAR.                       

501
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25,096
               ALL RIGHT.       
        SO MIX IT UP THOROUGHLY.
LOOK AT THOSE COLORS.           

502
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:27,298
        I FEEL LIKE I'M IN      
   THE SPICE MARKET IN BAHRAIN. 

503
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,699
         LET'S GRAB THOSE RIBS. 

504
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:30,968
ALL RIGHT.                      
                 SO LIBERALLY   
             JUST DUST THESE ON.

505
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,971
  NOW AREN'T WE SUPPOSED TO TAKE
    OFF THE SILVER SKIN FIRST?  
NO, THAT STAYS.                 

506
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,706
                      SERIOUSLY?
IT HELPS RETAIN                 
 THE MOISTURE.                  

507
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:39,377
               THE SILVER SKIN? 
              THIS I GOT TO SEE.
PUT THESE PUPPIES ON.           

508
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,511
     WE'RE NOT COOKING PUPPIES, 
      JUST SO EVERYBODY KNOWS.  

509
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:43,314
         WE'RE GONNA THROW THESE
             ON THE SMOKER.     

510
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:45,049
        SMOKING WITH PECAN WOOD?
YES.                            

511
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:46,650
                       HOW LONG.
THREE HOURS OR SO.              

512
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,852
     PUT HER DOWN, THREE HOURS, 
         THEN WE COME BACK.     

513
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:51,055
         NO BASTING, NO MOPPING,
               NO NOTHING.      
NO, SIR.                        

514
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:52,456
                           OKAY.
DONE.                           

515
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:54,858
   WHOA! LOOK AT THE CRAZY COLOR
             IN THIS.           

516
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:56,460
                   WATCH THIS.  
                 THAT IS TENDER.

517
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:58,662
             YOU SEE THAT?      
       LOOK AT THAT SILVER SKIN.

518
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:00,864
         THAT IS JUST COMING OFF
            AS SHOE LEATHER,    

519
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:03,534
    BUT YOU'RE RIGHT, IT KEPT   
 A LOT OF MOISTURE INSIDE THERE.
IT DOES.                        

520
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,936
          OKAY. MMM. WHOA.      
     THOSE RIBS ARE A KNOCKOUT. 

521
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:07,804
                TONS OF FLAVOR, 
              BETWEEN THE PECAN.

522
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,741
 THAT IS THE MOST UNIQUE DRY RUB
           I'VE TRIED.          

523
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:12,810
                I WOULDN'T EVEN 
              PUT SAUCE ON THIS.
NO.                             

524
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:15,079
         AND TENDER. IT'S COOKED
         ALL THE FAT OUT OF IT. 

525
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:17,481
      THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST   
   RIGHTEOUS RUBS I'VE EVER HAD.

526
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:20,017
             NICE JOB.          
   I JUST ATE 20 POUNDS OF PORK.
(man) A SLAB OF BABY BACKS.     
         ENJOY, MAN.            

527
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:23,553
        THE RIBS HERE ARE GREAT.
      LOVE THE RUB,             
SPICY ENOUGH, NOT TOO HOT.      

528
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,356
   IT'S A GREAT COMBINATION.    
I JUST LOVE THE FLAVOR, THE BEST
    I'VE HAD IN KANSAS CITY.    

529
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,959
I GOT AN ULTIMATE NUMBER ONE    
   AND A SMOKING KIELBASA.      

530
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:30,961

     IT, SO WE STICK WITH IT.   
IF IT AIN'T BROKE,              
  DON'T FIX IT.                 

534
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:40,171

FANTASTIC.
