       that is, if you're       
         a kid at heart.        

225
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:42,193
             This is            
    Nighthawk Breakfast Bar.    

226
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,394
        Breakfast burger.       

227
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,129
         Breakfast food         
      for an evening time.      

228
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,264
                 Pig's nest!    

229
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,467
     Super-fun, late night,     
       rock 'n' roll vibe.      

230
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:51,336
        This is all kinds       
        of "yes" for me.        

231
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:54,605
       I think it's odd when the
 breakfast place opens at 6 p.m.

232
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,541
    FIERI: But it makes sense   
  when you meet chef and owner, 

233
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:58,877
      Jeremy Fall, who has      
     a passion for kitchens     

234
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,278
      and late-night digs.      

235
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,013
My mom owned restaurants        
when I was growing up.          
                      Okay.     

236
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:03,949
 I did everything --            
  bus boy, runner.              

237
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:05,416
      -You've done it all.      
     -The whole nine-yards.     

238
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,552
I had this really weird, random 
idea to do breakfast for dinner,

239
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:09,820
so I started writing            
some ideas for dishes down.     

240
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,289
 I came up with some            
weird cocktail ideas.           

241
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,425
Have you had spiked cereal milk?
That's what we do here.         

242
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:14,759
     -Yeah, with the booze?     
             -Yeah.             

243
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,294
          I didn't know you were
    actually allowed to do that.

244
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:18,429
    But this dude's all about   
      pushing the envelope      

245
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,764
     on childhood favorites.    

246
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,165
        They put alcohol        
     in their French toast.     

247
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,633
      I got one                 
drunken French toast.           

248
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,635
  MAN: When you're looking for  
    something a little rich,    

249
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,838
       a little decadent,       
      try the French toast.     

250
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,174
             What are we making?
  Pear compote for              
the drunken French toast.       

251
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,242
         Can I get a milk crate?

252
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,777
Are you -- oh, you're           
getting up on the crate?        

253
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,445
                 So, anyhow...  
          [ Laughter ]          

254
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:37,048
             I'm light-headed --
             the altitude, dude.

255
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,850
              Let's fire it up. 
  We're gonna start             
   with the pears,              

256
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,518
brown sugar, white sugar.       

257
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,786
          -There we go.         
          -Lemon juice.         

258
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,455
             -Okay.             
   -Cognac -- nice and heavy.   

259
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:44,655
             Let that burn off. 

260
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:47,459
          Pears are cooking down
              to a nice syrup.  

261
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:48,860
               You're letting   
           all that great flavor

262
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,127
      of that pear come through.

263
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,596
          -What's next?         
-You have the mascarpone mousse.

264
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:53,064
           -Fantastic.          
          -Mascarpone.          

265
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:55,800
         A cross between whipped
         cream and cream cheese.

266
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:57,669
      You got a little bit tang,
             a little bit light.

267
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:58,737
Add some honey to it.           

268
00:08:58,739 --> 00:08:59,938
            Cardamom.           
          -Interesting.         

269
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,339
           Last but not least...

270
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:02,807
  -Batter for the French toast. 
             -Okay.             

271
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,743
  Some heavy cream.             
Here we go for some milk.       

272
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:06,944
             Because heavy cream
     by itself is just too much.

273
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:09,080
   Add some eggs.               
You want to just drink --       
                        Oh!     

274
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,681
            I do, I just got it,
     but I'm trying to cut down.

275
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:13,017
  Yeah, yeah.                   
     That's how I'm keeping this
                  together.     

276
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,886
Real vanilla abstract,          
 and some cinnamon.             

277
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,287
And then you want to do         
the honors on the booze --      

278
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,157
          pear brandy.          
        -Betcha it isn't.       

279
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,225
                 Yep, it is.    

280
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,493
              -Yep.             
      -That's good brandy.      

281
00:09:21,495 --> 00:09:23,094
     You have the whimsical side
           of what you're doing,

282
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:26,831
but you're also paying attention
to quality, method, ingredients.

283
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,165
We like taking stuff            
    like classics               

284
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,501
that people already like,       
and kind of tweaking them,      

285
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:30,902
and putting our take            
       on it.                   

286
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,103
      The batter's rather to go.

287
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:33,371
      Yes, sir.                 

288
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:35,173
       And now, we take--       
   -We're doing challah bread.  

289
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:36,974
             -Holla.            
    -You want to dip it deep.   

290
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,843
                    Whoa!       
         You're going real deep.

291
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:40,311
         -Throw it on --        
         -Crispy cereal?        

292
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,113
Yeah. You want to kind of       
  get it on there.              

293
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:43,248
             Look at that, dude.

294
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,783
             That's a full mess 
               you just made.   

295
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:45,650
              Where do you want 
                 the butter?    

296
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:47,719
          -Right there.         
          -Right here?          

297
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:50,187
               My son Ryder is  
        going bananas right now.

298
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,790
     So, we're going to let this
             cook on both sides,

299
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,124
              get a nice little 
                crunch to it.   

300
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:54,459
            -Exactly.           
           -Gorgeous.           

301
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,928
           Nice, puffy -- I like
        the way this is rolling.

302
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,596
I'm going to slice it.          

303
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,797
      Flip it.                  

304
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:03,001
           French toast, crunchy
           nuggets of happiness.

305
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:04,269
      Exactly.                  

306
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,670
Then you're going to take       
   the mascarpone.              

307
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:07,138
You kind of want to play it,    
almost like a football, right?  

308
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,340
            -Cornell?           
             -Sure.             

309
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:10,008
Actually, that's a classy       
 way of putting it.             

310
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,477
  We've over at Nighthawk making
   up some mascarpone footballs.

311
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:13,678
  The pear compote              
  we made earlier.              

312
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,214
        You guys got any muumuus
             for sale out front?

313
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:17,882
   -More of that pear brandy.   
       -That's just great.      

314
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:19,016
    Maple syrup,                
   powdered sugar.              

315
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,952
                There you go.   
              That's just fine. 

316
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:24,356
                  So, I get     
          the perfect bite here.

317
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:27,091
                 Nice crust,    
              but the squishy,  

318
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:31,296
            spongy deliciousness
         of the challah owns it.

319
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:34,099
Pears are great. The brandy kiss
       really matures the thing.

320
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:38,169
The key that ties it together is
the silky fat of the mascarpone.

321
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:40,038
     And then, without question,
                 the little,    

322
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,706
               crunchy niblets  
               on the outside.  

323
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,108
               That's a mature  
                French toast.   

324
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,643
      Seriously, well done.     
           -Thank you.          

325
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,911
                  Composed.     

326
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:48,913
    All right, table four --    
I need one drunken French toast.

327
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:50,848
    I've not had French toast   
        like this before.       

328
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,249
   The pear brandy on there...  

329
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,985
         -Is ridiculous.        
       -Absolutely killer.      

330
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,787
     We have it for dessert     
          all the time.         

331
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:56,654
              What do you think 
               of this place?   

332
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,855

558

   They're the best dumplings   
    I've ever had, for sure.

561
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:24,568

  on the mango-chipotle sauce.  

562

    -Dumplings are steaming.    
        -Kevin's awesome.       

563

     I remember helping him     
      at the barbecue fest.     

564
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:30,841
The biggest competition         
      you won?                  

565
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,309
             I beat Johnny Trigg
                  in ribs.      

566

567
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,113
                He took sixth   
              and I took fifth.

   -That's all that mattered!   

569
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:38,716
             I didn't care about
               anything else.   

570
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:40,117
             I just got to say,

   on top of this,              

587
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:10,881

to sit before it goes in?       

588
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,015
             Three to four hours
                  is good.      

589
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:13,284
      Bring out the flavor.     
          -Let it work.         

590
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:14,918
                  It smokes     
           for about four hours.

591
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,087
We like it pretty much more rare
              than medium-rare. 

592
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:20,491
Okay. So everybody gets this -- 
most prime ribs are not smoked. 

593
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,627
So, the amount of flavor

602
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:42,913
    Au jus -- that's what we put
 our meat in for our French dip.

00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,181
      We're just trying to bring
              that up to temp.

any time you serve a prime-rib  

612
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:03,800
 French dip, you got            
to have a little acid           

613
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:06,203
