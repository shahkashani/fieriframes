00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,511
       And she's passed on      
          her know-how          

450
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:15,580
        to daughter Maria       
          and son José.         

451
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:16,914
                 What makes     
              a great empanada? 

452
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,384
 A great empanada is            
crunchy on the outside,         

453
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:21,986
 a little bit sweet,            
savory in the inside.           

454
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:23,321
And always piping hot.          

455
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:25,122
          Here are your         
       chicken empanadas.       

456
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,591
   You come to Milly's and you  
    have to have an empanada.   

457
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,526
  One of the best in the world. 

458
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:32,730
We just go from total,          
typical empanada kitchen        

459
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:34,332
to, like, factory room.         

460
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:36,200
        It's a factory room, and
 everything's built to our size,

461
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:38,135
               as you can see.  

462
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:39,670
 Yeah, you guys have            
  done that right.              

463
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:40,938
      Yeah, we're gonna make our
        dough for our empanadas.

464
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,740
              We're gonna start 
            off with some water.

465
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:44,876
              White corn meal.  

466
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:46,143
              Yellow corn meal. 

467
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,679
             This gives a little
              bit of sweetness. 

468
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:49,614
                 Some sugar.    

469
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:50,815
         Some salt and some oil.

470
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:52,349
So no leavening agent.          

471
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:55,086
     Nope, the dough is gonna be
      very thin and very crispy.

472
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:56,954
        Okay.                   
Mix it for five minutes.        

473
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:57,956
        Next.                   

474
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,156
ATENCIO: Chicken breast         
       in salt                  

475
00:15:59,158 --> 00:15:59,958
for our chicken empanada.       

476
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,027
         Chicken breast in salt.

477
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:04,896
So it's gonna cook down         
 in its own liquids             

478
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:07,031
     for an hour                
   and 45 minutes.              

479
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:09,300
         Chicken breast in salt.

480
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,102
   We're gonna let              
the chicken cool down,          

481
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:12,770
shred it, and then all          
 the flavoring comes            

482
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:14,705
when we make our sofrito.       

483
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,774
I'm gonna start with some       
oil, some diced onions,         

484
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:17,909
 diced red peppers.             

485
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:19,444
                   Got it.      

486
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:21,178
   Green peppers,               
the diced green onions.         

487
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,780
                   Is this      
             the type of sofrito

488
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:24,048
             your mom made when 
               you were a kid?  

489
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,050
 Absolutely, and it             
hasn't changed at all.          

490
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:28,453
  Bunch of garlic,              
cilantro, some mint.            

491
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:30,521
            -Oregano?           
           -Some salt.          

492
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:31,923
           And some annatto oil.

493
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:33,391
        Yeah.                   

494
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:34,525
    You're gonna get some really
        beautiful saffron color.

495
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:36,193
              This is all gonna 
              get translucent?  

496
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:37,928
After about 20 minutes          
       or so.                   

497
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,930
         That's gonna get folded
      into the shredded chicken.

498
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,532
      Correct,                  
let's spoon this in.            

499
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:42,533
                   Got it.      

500
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:44,935
   Chicken broth,               
    annatto oil.                

501
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,471
     Fold it in.                

502
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:47,604
    Next thing we're gonna do is
      make this actual empanada.

503
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:48,940
        Yeah.                   

504
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:51,142
Grab a portion of our chicken   
filling, fold it over.          

505
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:54,411
We're gonna cut this out.       

506
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,280
                    Dude,       
         that's not an empanada.

507
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:58,982
             That's like half of
             an empanada planet.

508
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:01,219
        So we're gonna drop that
      in the fryer, 350 degrees?

509
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,953
        Yes,                    
our empanadas are ready.        

510
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,489
       That's a lot of empanada.

511
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:06,290
And we have a parsley           
sauce that goes with it.        

512
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:07,758
               Parsley sauce.   

513
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,293
Water, onions, parsley,         

514
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:11,362
   green peppers,               
    garlic, salt,               

515
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,965
       sugar,                   
a little bit of vinegar.        

516
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:14,866
    Put this on.                

517
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:18,636
 Now we're gonna add            
  this parsley mix              

518
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:20,505
    into the bowl               
   of mayonnaise.               

519
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:21,706
               Parsley sauce.

523
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:30,648
            I've had some really
               good empanadas,  

524
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:34,385

528
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,058
       The interesting thing is,

529
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,927
             which I was hating 
              on the fact that  

530
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:45,196
               you were using   
             the chicken breast 

531
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:46,330
         in the pressure cooker,

532
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:48,465
              but you want that 
            texture and the chew

533
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,068
                that you get    
              from the chicken.
