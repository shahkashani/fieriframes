BUT THE BIG CALCULATION THAT    
MAKES THIS ALL TIE TOGETHER,    

101
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,983
      THE BREAD

105

        IT'S VERY TENDER.       

109
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:33,138
        IT'S HARD TO FIND       
        A CUBAN ANYWHERE

          GOT A CHICKEN SANDWICH
                 FOR YOU.       
 YOU CAN EXPECT A GOOD VARIETY. 
    EVERYTHING HERE IS FRESH.   

287
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:47,972
AND THE EXPERIENCE OF COMING    
 HERE IS REALLY, REALLY FUN.    

288
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,841
  YOU GUYS ARE IN FOR A TREAT.  
            PART OF THE FUN     

289
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:52,444
 IS ACTUALLY WATCHING JERAD COOK
          ON THE GRILL.         
      JOKE WITH THE CHEFS.      

290
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:55,446
  I'M NOT THAT GOOD OF A DANCER,
   SO I GOT TO RELY ON THE FOOD.
           (laughter)           

291
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,582
ALL QUALITY STUFF.              
            (man)               
    BACON MUSHROOM SWISS.       

292
00:11:57,651 --> 00:11:58,983
                   JUST THE MOP.
    THE MOP.                    

293
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:01,652
  THE MEAT LOAF IS GREAT. IT'S  
 ALMOST LIKE MY MOM'S MEAT LOAF.

294
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:04,723
     PORK LOIN TABLE 20.        
IT'S ALL COMFORT FOOD           
    WITH A TWIST.               

295
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:08,192
   <i> LIKE THE PORK CHOP BRINED,</i>  
      <i> SMOKED, AND GRILLED.</i>     

296
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,261
              OH, MY GOSH.      
            IT IS WONDERFUL.    

297
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:12,330
  <i> 'CAUSE THIS DUDE KNOWS PORK.</i> 

298
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,665
         I WORKED ON A HOG FARM 
        FOR A LITTLE WHILE, TOO.
   WHEN YOU'RE                  
GONNA COOK PORK,                

299
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,867
YOU GOT TO HAVE THE AUTHORITY   
         RIGHT HERE.            

300
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,337
SO WE'RE MAKING THE BRINE       
   FOR THE PORK CHOPS.          
                       YES, SIR.

301
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,806
 FIRST, WE'RE GONNA DO A LITTLE 
CORIANDER. IT'S ALREADY TOASTED.

302
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,409
     LITTLE SUGAR. I DO A LITTLE
        LESS SALT THAN SUGAR.   
YOU'LL BE SEASONING IT          

303
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,878
 WHEN IT GOES                   
ON THE GRIDDLE.                 
                   THAT'S RIGHT.

304
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:29,947
DIG IT.                         
 LITTLE BIT OF BAY LEAF IN THERE
   FOR THAT NICE PINEY TASTE,   

305
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:33,017
   THYME, LITTLE VANILLA BEAN.  
       THIS IS MADAGASCAR.      
 THAT'S WHERE ALL THE COOKIE IS,
      THAT LITTLE WAXY TAR.     

306
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:35,353
 THAT FLORAL ACCENT THAT SITS IN
THE BACKGROUND OF THE PORK CHOP.

307
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:38,223
  ARE WE ALREADY                
INTO FLORAL ACCENT?             
                 WELL, YOU KNOW.

308
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:40,158
           A LITTLE LEMON JUICE.
GOT TO HAVE ACID.               

309
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,961
                  FAT IS FLAVOR.
                   ACID IS LIFE.
OOH.                            

310
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:45,096
      ADD A LITTLE BIT OF WATER.
THE FORCE IS STRONG             
   IN THIS ONE.                 

311
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,332
SIMMER IT. LET IT ALL COOK DOWN.
          LET IT COOL.          

312
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,300
LOOK AT SOME OF THE MARBLING    
       INSIDE OF THAT.          

313
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,302
IT'S A GOOD-LOOKING CHOP        
      RIGHT THERE.              

314
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,371
THAT'S NOT YOUR STANDARD        
     EVERYDAY CHOP.             

315
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,840
THAT'S NOT YOUR STANDARD        
     EVERYDAY BRINE.            
                   POUR IT      
             RIGHT OVER THE TOP.

316
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:58,709
HOW LONG WILL YOU LET THIS      
   SIT THERE AND BRINE?         
                 ABOUT 24 HOURS.

317
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,378
REALLY?                         
          THAT WAY, IT SEEPS IN.

318
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,914
       ALL THE FLAVORS MARRY,   
     AND IT GETS NICE AND JUICY.

319
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:05,383
        THEN WE'RE GONNA TAKE IT
           OUT TO THE SMOKER.   
LET'S DO IT.                    

320
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,852
                      ALL RIGHT.
EVERYTHING'S JUST A LITTLE BIT  
  DIFFERENT HERE AT GATSBY'S.   

321
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:10,121
WHAT KIND OF CHIPS?             
                WE GOT SOME     
             APPLE WOOD CHIPS,  

322
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,524
              COFFEE BEANS      
         TO ADD RICH BACKGROUND.

323
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:15,326
 IT HAS ALMOST A MOCHA FLAVOR TO
 IT. RIGHT ON TOP OF THE COALS. 
SHOULD BE INTERESTING.          

324
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:18,196
NOW HOW LONG WE GONNA           
 PUT SMOKE ON THESE?            
           FOR ABOUT FOUR HOURS.

325
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:20,931
BUT YOU'RE GOING                
LOW TEMPERATURE.                
         IT DOESN'T GET OVER 165
                IN THERE.       

326
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,134
SO WE'RE JUST PERFUMING IT.     
                      THAT'S IT.

327
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,202
LET'S GO. SMOKED CHOP.          
                    SMOKED CHOP.

328
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:27,605
FIRE IT UP.                     
                   SEA SALT,    
              SOME BLACK PEPPER.

329
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,608
NO OIL?                         
          NO OIL JUST YET.      
    IT'S GOT ENOUGH FAT IN THERE

330
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,210
                 AND GET IT NICE
                   AND CRISPY.  
     SMELLS LIKE                
WE'RE COOKING A HAM.            

331
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:36,147
                     YEAH, YEAH.
THE JOWLS ARE WARMING UP        
       RIGHT NOW.               

332
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,749
              GOT SOME BLUE LAKE
                 GREEN BEANS.   
  DID YOU BLANCH                
THOSE GREEN BEANS?              

333
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:41,619
    I DO. I DO. LITTLE SEA SALT,
            BLACK PEPPER.       

334
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:44,021
            GOT ABOUT TWO,      
       MAYBE THREE MINUTES HERE.
WE READY TO GO?                 

335
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:46,357
                    YES, WE ARE.
OKAY.                           

336

            GET THEM GREEN BEANS
                OFF OF THERE.   
  I CAN SMELL THE SMOKE         
COMING OFF IT RIGHT NOW.        

337
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:52,163
                            YEP.
MMM. YOU SEE THAT?              

338
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,432
   LOOK AT THE JUICE            
THAT COMES OUT OF THIS.         

339
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:56,634
   THERE'S A REAL GOOD          
BALANCE HERE, THE SMOKE,        

340
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:59,503
 THE SEASONING, STYLE OF COOKING
       OF YOUR PORK CHOP.       

341
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:02,574
MMM. DIG THAT. CONGRATS.        
                         THANKS.

342

                   (man)        
           CENTER CUT PORK CHOP.
        IT'S VERY JUICY,        
      GREAT PIECE OF MEAT.      

343
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:08,179
     (woman) THE SMOKE IN IT    
           IS AWESOME.          
    CENTER CUT PORK CHOP UP.    

344
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,315
 IT'S NOT RUN OF THE MILL,      
WHICH MAKES IT REALLY FUN.      

345
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,250
WE'VE DONE A LITTLE BIT         
    OF THE UNIQUE,              

346
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:14,052
  SMOKED PORK CHOP              
AND A BEET SANDWICH.            

347
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,721
WHEN WE COME BACK TO GATSBY'S

                 THIS IS OLD    
            EUROPEAN, DELICIOUS.

350
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:23,795
     WAIT TILL YOU SEE THIS.    

351
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,734
 WELCOME BACK TO GATSBY'S       
IN SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA.      

352
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:33,004
NOW WE MADE A SMOKED PORK CHOP

BUT NOW WE'RE GOING TRADITIONAL,
     AND WHAT ARE WE MAKING?

00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,543
         WE ARE GONNA BE MAKING 
         A GERMAN BEEF ROULADEN.

356
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:41,545
             MY MOM COOKED A LOT
               OF GERMAN FOOD.  

357
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,481
      ROULADEN WAS ONE OF THOSE.
ROULADEN?                       

358

               A BUTTERBALL CUT.

361
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:53,557
        THAT'LL BE THE NICER END
        OF THE MEAT RIGHT THERE.

  WE'RE GONNA TAKE SOME OF OUR
