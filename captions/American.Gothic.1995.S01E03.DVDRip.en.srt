1
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:26,443
Previously on American Gothic:

2
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:31,907
I want the boy.

3
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,785
Caleb isn't going anywhere
until I say so.

4
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,502
This document grants me
sole custody of Caleb.

5
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:47,047
And I'd like you to sign it.

6
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:53,762
Happy birthday.

7
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,807
Are you a ghost?
No.

8
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:59,142
Angel?
I'm your family.

9
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:02,646
Be careful, Caleb.
Someone's at the door.

10
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,858
No more running, son.

11
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,365
Caleb!

12
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:17,411
A 10-year-old boy
with a 30-minute start.
I want him back by sundown.

13
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,663
Does Caleb know
his father's dead?

14
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,082
I don't see how he could.
He's been running all night.

15
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:33,302
Look, whatever you think
about Lucas, he's helped out
a lot of folks in this town.

16
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:36,889
How's that?
By giving them
a second chance.

17
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,641
The Sheriff is after me.
He thinks he's my daddy.

18
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:42,311
And what do you think?
I think he's crazy.

19
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,812
What do you want with him?

20
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:46,940
I'm just doing my job, ma'am,
got to protect my people.

21
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,358
Like my parents?

22
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,235
They died in a fire, ma'am.

23
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,821
No, they died because they
were trapped in a building.

24
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:55,324
Someone had locked them
in there.

25
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,582
You really my cousin?
Yeah.

26
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:07,252
I live in you, Caleb,
and so does your father.

27
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:08,962
Merlyn, look out.

28
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:30,734
Hello, Mr. Wills.
I'm Dr. Crower.
Feeling all right?

29
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,528
TV in my room's broke.

30
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,154
We'll have to get it
fixed for you.

31
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:36,740
This is Dan Truelane,
our anesthesiologist.

32
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,660
So you're
the dream master, huh?
Oh, yeah.

33
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,495
It's a very
simple procedure,
Mr. Wills.

34
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:42,746
Laparoscopic surgery...

35
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,957
four little holes,
we take out
the gallbladder...

36
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,792
you'll probably be home
in the morning.

37
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,460
Do I get steak and eggs
for breakfast?

38
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:49,795
Well, I don't know
about that.

39
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:59,137
You really had us worried,
son, running off like that.

40
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:02,391
You almost gave
your cousin, Gail,
a heart attack.

41
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,476
Where are we going?

42
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,311
To the hospital.

43
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,105
The doctor just wants
to check you out...

44
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,065
and make sure
that everything is all right.

45
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,609
Yeah, a quick checkup,
you'll be on your way.

46
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,278
On my way where?

47
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,446
My place.

48
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,824
I got a wicked
electric train set.

49
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:21,743
And you know
what I like for breakfast?
Apple pie and ice cream.

50
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,161
Sound good?

51
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,247
I really want
to stay with Dr. Matt.

52
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,500
Son, you had your stay
with the good doctor
and you ran away.

53
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,878
If he'd been looking out
for you better...

54
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:33,839
none of that business
in the woods
would've happened.

55
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,591
Yes, sir,
with your family gone now...

56
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:38,635
it's time you start trusting
the man with the star.

57
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,388
Okay, Mr. Wills,
I'm gonna place
this mask on you...

58
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,141
and I want you to start
counting backwards from 10,
all right?

59
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,102
Sure that thing
ain't broke, too?

60
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,022
Well now,
if your head explodes,
we'll know.

61
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:55,652
Ten, nine, eight...

62
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:59,698
Hey, you with us, bud?
Yeah.

63
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,326
I was just...
I'm wondering about Caleb.

64
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,037
Caleb's fine.
Meanwhile, it's showtime.

65
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,663
I'm gonna scrub.

66
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:13,545
I tell you about
my pool table?

67
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:15,255
Look, I'm his family now...

68
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:18,675
and until there's a hearing,
he can stay wherever
he wants to stay.

69
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,052
A hearing?

70
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,764
The state welfare bureaucrats,
you mean?

71
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,225
Ms. Emory, you been
in the big city too long.

72
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:30,103
The beauty of a small town
like Trinity is that
we take care of our own.

73
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:34,441
And the beauty of big cities
is that people
can take care of themselves.

74
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:38,403
If you want to stay
in the hospital tonight,
Caleb, that's fine.

75
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,532
In fact, I might
just stay there with you.

76
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,326
Well, won't that be cozy?
Just the two of you.

77
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,078
In intensive care.

78
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:49,081
Hospital can be
a mighty cold place, son.

79
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,875
I don't like trains
and I hate apple pie.

80
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,629
Well, fine. You just get
a good night's sleep.

81
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,674
Tomorrow we'll ask my friend
Judge Halpern...

82
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:02,094
to figure out
the living situation
on a temporary basis.

83
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:13,438
I'll walk you in.
No, that's all right.

84
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,524
I'm sure
you have other duties.

85
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:18,277
Well, sure.
I reckon I do...

86
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,864
but this is a pleasure.

87
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,158
Give it up.
Ma'am?

88
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:27,703
I'll just wait out here, then.

89
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:31,748
You can wait all you want,
but I'm staying
at the hospital with Dr. Matt.

90
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,333
You sure, son?

91
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,589
Well, okay, then.
You get up there
and see Dr. Matt.

92
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,968
See how he's doing.

93
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,018
All right.

94
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,020
Make sure that line's
clear over there.

95
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,855
His heart rate's up.

96
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,110
Let me look at his eyes.

97
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:13,016
Code blue!

98
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,351
Dr. Williams, can I see you
down here, stat?

99
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:15,769
Yes, sir.

100
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,068
He's having a seizure.
What's his oxygen?

101
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,903
Ninety-five percent.

102
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,535
I need 10 ml IV Valium. Now.

103
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,455
Just hold him down,
hold his head.

104
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,960
Where's the Valium?

105
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:43,881
What have you done
to that man?

106
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:44,965
Stay out of this room.

107
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,259
Get the boy out of here!

108
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,890
It's all right, Gordy,
it's all right.

109
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:56,226
It's all right. That's it.

110
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:06,236
This how you treat
all your patients?
He had a seizure.

111
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,281
Of course he did,
he's an epileptic.
According to whom?

112
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:13,076
Tell me, Harvard, what is
the proper procedure for
anesthetizing an epileptic?

113
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,204
There's nothing
on this man's chart
about epilepsy.

114
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:16,622
Oh, really?

115
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,499
Daniel, can you confirm that?

116
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:27,132
"Subject to
Jacksonian seizures.

117
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:29,635
Check with
attending physician
before anesthesia."

118
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:32,262
That wasn't there before.
Are you sure, Doctor?

119
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:35,349
Not having one of them
blackouts now, are you?

120
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:38,644
Would you get out of here
before I call security?

121
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:42,105
You hang in there, champ.
You're gonna be okay.

122
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:44,650
Sleep well.

123
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,113
Enjoy your stay.

124
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:58,163
This wasn't here, Matt.

125
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:00,290
Look, I don't know what
that son of a bitch did...

126
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,334
but I'm telling you,
that wasn't there before.

127
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,211
Well, it's there now.

128
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,468
What you gonna do

129
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:16,098
When Death comes creeping
in your room

130
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:20,143
When Death comes creeping
in your room

131
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,980
What you gonna do

132
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:27,442
You gonna pray to the Lord

133
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:31,321
Oh, please deliver me

134
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:34,491
What you gonna do

135
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:38,996
When Death comes for you

136
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:42,207
What you gonna do

137
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:47,421
There is a heaven
and there is a hell

138
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:52,509
But the fires of hell
burn on in brimstone

139
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:54,720
Is your soul on fire,
Daniel?

140
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,889
What do you mean?

141
00:09:57,723 --> 00:09:59,183
I'm just teasing.

142
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,101
Come on children

143
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:03,812
And look
into Satan's casket

144
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,857
And stare
into the face of sin

145
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:11,737
You've got to rise
and see the face
of your tormentor

146
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,198
You coming?
It's for kids, Cheryl.

147
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,742
Come on.

148
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,912
Come on, you're afraid
of what you might see?

149
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,205
Look, you go on.

150
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:25,918
Come on, children,
and look into
Satan's casket

151
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,087
Oh, yes

152
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:32,633
Quite a show.

153
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,054
Leave me alone.

154
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:40,933
That was some
pretty nasty business
at the hospital, Daniel.

155
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:43,560
I'd hate to see
a fine churchgoer
like yourself...

156
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,938
punished for
another man's crime.

157
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:49,274
That was just a taste
of how irresponsible
that Doc Crower can be.

158
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:50,400
Things happen.

159
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:54,321
Well,
what's happening tomorrow
is a little custody hearing...

160
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,241
and I'd like to count
on your support.

161
00:10:57,324 --> 00:11:00,285
I think it's only right
that the custody judge
be made aware...

162
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:03,038
of the good doctor's history,
don't you?

163
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,708
If this is about Caleb,
you don't have anything
to worry about.

164
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:09,253
Dr. Crower is not looking
to be his daddy.

165
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:10,587
But I am.

166
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:14,633
And in order to make
that happen, I'm going
to need your testimony.

167
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:18,470
Help put
the good doctor's character
in perspective for the boy.

168
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:20,472
Anyone ever tell you...

169
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:23,517
that talking in church
was a sin?

170
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:25,394
Come on, people

171
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:29,356
Come up and see
the reflection of the devil
in your own eyes

172
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,567
Beautiful wife
you got there.

173
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:33,819
Newlyweds, aren't you?

174
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:42,536
Children, you don't want
your souls a-burning today

175
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:07,769
What were the two of you
talking about?

176
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:08,896
Who?

177
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:11,356
Lucas Buck.

178
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:15,861
Mr. Trinity, godfather
to half the children
in this town?

179
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:18,906
Yeah, well, he won't
be godfather to our children.

180
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:21,992
We're gonna have
the most beautiful kids
in the world.

181
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,244
And the smartest, too.
Yeah.

182
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,289
If they take after you.

183
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,389
Daniel.

184
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:45,641
Hmm?

185
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,435
Is there a problem
between you and the Sheriff?

186
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,646
No...

187
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:55,317
We had a close call
in the operating room today...

188
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,362
and the Sheriff
just happened to come
in in the middle of it.

189
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:07,329
He seems like
a pretty nice guy, I mean,
he has a nice smile.

190
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,039
I hadn't noticed.

191
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,709
You must've been studying
him pretty close.

192
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,211
Silly.

193
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,341
Jesus!

194
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:21,176
Hold on!

195
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:32,521
You okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.

196
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,773
You okay?

197
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,608
Yeah. Stay here.

198
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:47,286
Damn bird came out of nowhere.

199
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:00,799
You folks need a hand?

200
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:09,099
South Carolina, southern
hemisphere or northern?

201
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:10,934
Southern.

202
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:13,937
Well now, you'd think so,
but it's northern.

203
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:17,316
Now, Tropic of Cancer.

204
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:20,110
Who can come up here
and show me...

205
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:22,571
Caleb Temple.

206
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:26,491
Well, it's about time
you got here.

207
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,828
We're so glad
you're back with us,
safe and sound.

208
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:33,457
Aren't we, people?
Yes, Ms. Coombs.

209
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,585
Now, you go on
and take your seat, Caleb.

210
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:40,339
I know you had a rough time,
but maybe for show-and-tell...

211
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,717
you could share your adventure
with Sheriff Buck.

212
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:46,011
It wasn't no adventure.

213
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:48,972
We heard he saved your life.

214
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,141
Well, he didn't.

215
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,103
Well, you go on
and sit down, okay?

216
00:14:56,813 --> 00:15:00,150
Now, you're the famous
reporter from Charleston,
aren't you?

217
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:02,402
No, not so famous,
just a reporter.

218
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:06,323
Nonsense.
"Local Girl Makes Good."
I read that story.

219
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,868
Hey, people, how about
if Ms. Emory tells us...

220
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,496
her adventures
as a newspaper reporter.

221
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:13,789
You know, I have to go.

222
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:17,668
No, please,
Ms. Emory, please.
Please, Miss Emory.

223
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,211
Come on.

224
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:23,715
You're such a wonderful
role model, especially
for the little girls.

225
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:26,885
Okay.

226
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:32,266
Well...

227
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:39,731
Well, reporters
get to write about...

228
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:44,152
what they really care about,
you know, like...

229
00:15:45,404 --> 00:15:47,656
well, the environment,
for instance.

230
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,241
Okay, they could...

231
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:52,411
If they're concerned
about the environment
they could write about that...

232
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:53,954
or politics...

233
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,790
What is your favorite subject,
Ms. Emory?

234
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,210
Crime, actually.

235
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:02,588
Really?

236
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:07,926
How would you kids
like to hear some
true crime stories?

237
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,054
You know something?
I really don't think...
Yeah!

238
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:12,890
Okay.

239
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:17,728
Well, you know,
I've been in a lot of
very scary situations.

240
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:21,523
Just last month
I had to go undercover.

241
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:27,946
Hey, babe. How you doing?

242
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,619
More presents.

243
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:36,538
Who's this one from,
Aunt Molly, Aunt Sara?

244
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,334
I hope there's something
to eat in it, I'm starved.

245
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:42,794
I haven't made lunch yet.

246
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:45,797
Oh, that's okay.
I'll just nuke something
from last night.

247
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:46,924
Wait.

248
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:49,801
I'm dying to open this.

249
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:53,430
Honey, I'm back on call
in half an hour.
Dan, come on.

250
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:56,600
We promised we'd open
all our presents together.

251
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:58,977
It'd be bad luck
to change now.

252
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:02,356
That was five toasters
and three Crock-Pots ago.

253
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:05,859
Okay, come on.

254
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:22,668
How marvelous.
Who's this from?

255
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:26,421
"With best wishes
for a successful marriage.

256
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:29,258
Warmest regards, Lucas Buck."

257
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:31,844
Oh, man.

258
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:35,681
Yeah, it'll look great
in the garage.

259
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:50,362
Applesauce...

260
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:54,199
and tapioca.

261
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:58,036
Man, hospital food
really bites.

262
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:02,332
Where you gonna live,
now your house is gone?

263
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,543
Don't know.

264
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,421
They're having some kind
of meeting on it today.

265
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,631
Maybe I could stay with you.

266
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:14,011
I don't know.
My folks might not like that.

267
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:17,890
Well, I don't need
my own room or nothing.

268
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:21,518
My daddy says,
"The apple don't fall
far from the tree."

269
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:23,228
What's that mean?

270
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:26,732
I guess he's afraid
you're like your daddy.

271
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:34,615
I gotta go.
You know how I lost my house?

272
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:37,826
How?
Burned it down.

273
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:57,346
Caleb.

274
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:02,601
Merlyn?

275
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:11,860
Where you going?

276
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:25,541
Come on, Caleb. Follow me.

277
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:29,336
Come this way, Caleb.

278
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:32,923
Caleb.

279
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:01,201
Follow me, Caleb.

280
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:51,418
Stop the presses! Lucas Buck's
been elected Sheriff.

281
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:29,122
Merlyn?

282
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:31,750
You here?

283
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:52,521
Hope you ain't mad at me.

284
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:05,636
Come on, Merlyn.

285
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:32,371
Don't touch that, Caleb.
Not now, not ever.

286
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:34,957
I just wanted to fix her eyes.

287
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,377
Don't need fixing.
She can see just fine.

288
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:40,629
How'd you know my name?

289
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:43,048
Everybody knows
your name, Caleb.

290
00:23:43,382 --> 00:23:45,467
Now, I didn't mean
to scare you, Caleb.

291
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:49,513
And you're welcome to
look around. Just be careful
what you touch.

292
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:07,865
Hey, I'm leaving now, honey.

293
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:10,701
Look, I left some of
that pasta salad for you
on the table.

294
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:12,870
You like this color, Danny?

295
00:24:13,245 --> 00:24:15,330
Yeah, it's very pretty.

296
00:24:16,832 --> 00:24:19,293
Look, anyway,
I've gotta go prep
Mrs. Hardaway...

297
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:21,587
for tomorrow
morning's surgery.

298
00:24:22,713 --> 00:24:24,715
Forget old Mrs. Hardaway.

299
00:24:29,303 --> 00:24:31,054
Come to me, Daniel.

300
00:24:32,431 --> 00:24:34,183
Cheryl, I really...

301
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:43,692
Cheryl, I really
don't have time.

302
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:55,370
What is it with you?

303
00:24:58,081 --> 00:25:00,042
I've got to get to work.

304
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:10,844
Startle you, Dan?
Didn't mean to.

305
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:15,807
Used to be the front porch
was where friends gathered,
kind of a public space.

306
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:18,185
What have you done?
You like my little gift?

307
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:19,853
It was actually
for both of you.

308
00:25:19,937 --> 00:25:23,148
That mirror's changing her.
Come on, don't be so dramatic.

309
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,234
Some men might
appreciate that change.

310
00:25:25,317 --> 00:25:28,612
But if you don't,
all you've got to do is
help me out at this hearing...

311
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:31,281
and I'll make sure
Cheryl straightens right up.

312
00:25:31,323 --> 00:25:34,243
Fair?
You want me to lie
about my friend.

313
00:25:34,785 --> 00:25:36,453
On the contrary...

314
00:25:37,162 --> 00:25:39,206
I want you
to tell the truth...

315
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:41,625
about Matt Crower's
curious past.

316
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:43,627
See you there.

317
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:03,605
Why aren't you in school?
It's lunch.

318
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,900
Well, I don't see you eating.

319
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:09,027
I ain't hungry.

320
00:26:09,862 --> 00:26:11,572
You lose something?

321
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:17,077
Them masks for Halloween?

322
00:26:17,286 --> 00:26:19,037
They're from Africa.

323
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:22,583
Supposed to
represent the spirits
of my dead ancestors.

324
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:24,376
Pretty cool, huh?

325
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:28,547
You ever seen one?
One what?

326
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:31,633
Ghost.
Have you?

327
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:37,764
Maybe.
Well, then maybe I have, too.

328
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:42,186
Man by the name
of Andrew Vantage...

329
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:45,564
built this house
150 years ago.

330
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:48,609
Got the land cheap.
Know why?

331
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:50,986
Swamp?

332
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:55,282
This used to be a graveyard.
Holy ground.

333
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:59,411
But I've had lots of folks
stay here over the years...

334
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:01,622
and nobody's complained yet.

335
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:04,249
Grab three plates.

336
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:13,967
Have some bread.
Then you can help me.

337
00:27:14,051 --> 00:27:16,011
Help you what?
Make soup.

338
00:27:17,471 --> 00:27:19,139
Come on, sit down.

339
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:24,394
Who's that one for?

340
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,773
Ghosts have to eat, too,
don't they?

341
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:41,286
You know,
I want to help him, Matt.

342
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,956
But I want to do
the right thing.

343
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:46,583
I just don't know
what that is.

344
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:48,710
It's whatever Caleb wants.

345
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:52,881
Exactly, but...

346
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:57,344
he seems to think
you're the only one
he can trust.

347
00:27:57,427 --> 00:27:59,763
Well, I don't think
I'm an option, I mean...

348
00:27:59,805 --> 00:28:02,349
I'll do whatever I can
to see that
he gets a good home...

349
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,935
but no judge
would grant me custody.

350
00:28:05,936 --> 00:28:07,187
I basically
live at the hospital.

351
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:10,065
Maybe you could take
Caleb back to Charleston,
you could start over.

352
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:12,442
Judge might like the idea
of a new environment.

353
00:28:12,484 --> 00:28:15,612
No, his friends are here,
his school.
Well...

354
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,074
all we're talking about
in the hearing
is a temporary resolution...

355
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:21,285
till the Child Services
people get into it.

356
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:24,037
Any temporary situation
is fine by me...

357
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:26,832
as long as
it doesn't include
Lucas Buck.

358
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:34,131
Why is he after Caleb,
anyway?
Oh, I don't know.

359
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,842
Maybe he wants a protégé.

360
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:39,761
Imagine a man like that
raising you.

361
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:45,350
Better be careful, Harris.
That stuff will kill you.

362
00:28:45,434 --> 00:28:48,395
Well, it's organic.
I meant the tomatoes.

363
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:51,356
You know, folks
used to believe
they were poison apples.

364
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,151
I didn't know
you were a gardener, Lucas.

365
00:28:54,193 --> 00:28:55,819
I've been known
to pull a few weeds.

366
00:28:55,903 --> 00:28:58,155
Yeah, for me,
it's therapeutic.

367
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,616
Plant a seed,
watch it grow.

368
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:04,703
Feel like you're giving
a little something back.

369
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:08,498
Kind of like campaigning,
then getting reelected,
huh, Judge?

370
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:12,211
I meant to thank you
for that contribution, Lucas.

371
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:15,797
Now you can.
What's on your mind?

372
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:18,425
Caleb Temple.
You read my report?

373
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:21,011
Well, I glanced at it.
Good.

374
00:29:22,221 --> 00:29:25,015
I just want to make sure
we're on the same page.

375
00:29:25,057 --> 00:29:29,228
The boy's had a rough time,
you know. He lost his father,
his sister.

376
00:29:29,311 --> 00:29:33,232
He's gonna be all alone,
Harris. He's gonna need
proper guidance.

377
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:35,567
Well, I understand
a cousin's in town.

378
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:38,362
That's true, and under
normal circumstances...

379
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:40,948
she would be
the logical candidate
for custody...

380
00:29:41,031 --> 00:29:43,742
but unfortunately,
she is a bit unstable.

381
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:46,203
Never recovered
from the loss
of her parents.

382
00:29:46,245 --> 00:29:48,872
Things like that
could confuse a child.

383
00:29:49,206 --> 00:29:51,208
That's exactly
what I'm getting at.

384
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,626
Caleb has this notion...

385
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:55,879
that he ought to
stay with this doctor
he hardly even knows.

386
00:29:55,921 --> 00:29:58,841
Fella's even more dangerous
than his cousin.

387
00:29:59,216 --> 00:30:01,844
He likes his cocktails.
Got you.

388
00:30:02,553 --> 00:30:06,014
At any rate,
after much soul-searching,
I've decided to step up...

389
00:30:06,098 --> 00:30:07,850
and offer my home
to the boy.

390
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:10,143
Well, that's certainly
admirable of you, Lucas.

391
00:30:10,227 --> 00:30:11,770
I didn't know
you liked children.

392
00:30:11,854 --> 00:30:14,398
I feel it's my duty
as a concerned citizen.

393
00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:16,775
The youth of today
represent the future, Judge.

394
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:19,444
And I believe we must do
everything in our power...

395
00:30:19,528 --> 00:30:22,948
to make sure they are given
the right tools for survival.

396
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,324
I understand.

397
00:30:24,408 --> 00:30:27,870
So, I can count on you
to support me on this?

398
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,622
I'll do the right thing.

399
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:37,504
Let's go over it once more.

400
00:30:37,588 --> 00:30:41,300
The patient came
in complaining of right upper
quadrant pain after eating.

401
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:44,428
Gallbladder ultrasound
was positive for stones.

402
00:30:44,595 --> 00:30:46,763
No allergies.
No allergies.

403
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:50,434
Alkaline phosphatase
mildly elevated.

404
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:53,979
Normal bilirubin.
Okay, then we're covered.

405
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:56,815
No, I'm not really concerned
about being covered, Danny.

406
00:30:56,857 --> 00:30:59,818
Patient's gonna be fine,
I just want to find out
what went wrong.

407
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,111
Oh, man.

408
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:04,364
There was nothing
on Wills' chart
about epilepsy.

409
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:07,868
And all of a sudden there was,
and now my ass is in a sling.

410
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:10,037
Says who? What's going on?

411
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:15,959
Everything okay at home?
Yeah.

412
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:19,755
Everything's fine.

413
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:26,094
You got a job?

414
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:29,431
This is a boarding house.

415
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:33,435
It may be
a non-profit organization,
but that's not on purpose.

416
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:37,397
I don't have any money.

417
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:40,734
Look,
don't you worry about that.
You a good worker.

418
00:31:45,614 --> 00:31:49,076
You know, it's no shame
to lose someone you love,
Caleb.

419
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:51,828
It happens. All the time.

420
00:31:54,957 --> 00:31:57,709
Now come on,
I want you to do me a favor.

421
00:32:02,673 --> 00:32:04,049
Smells good.

422
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:07,553
I think you added
the missing ingredient, Caleb.

423
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:10,722
What?
Compassion.

424
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:17,229
Now you know
that big white house
over on Jackson?

425
00:32:17,354 --> 00:32:20,732
I want you
to take some of this
over there. All right?

426
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:22,234
All right.

427
00:32:26,405 --> 00:32:27,531
Caleb.

428
00:32:36,999 --> 00:32:40,419
What you been doing?
Making soup.

429
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:42,796
Wow.

430
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,215
It must be good.

431
00:32:47,885 --> 00:32:50,721
You know, our mamas
were really good cooks.

432
00:32:51,513 --> 00:32:53,557
I bet you take after them.

433
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:57,102
Did you know my mama?
I think so.

434
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:02,941
I was pretty young then...

435
00:33:03,275 --> 00:33:04,943
when I moved away.

436
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:07,279
But I can see her face.

437
00:33:08,322 --> 00:33:12,701
Maybe it's just
from snapshots,
or old movies, you know?

438
00:33:16,538 --> 00:33:18,624
I wish I remembered better.

439
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:22,628
You look like her.
Yeah?

440
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:26,089
Thank you.

441
00:33:28,217 --> 00:33:31,512
Say, you want
a ride somewhere?
No, thanks.

442
00:33:32,137 --> 00:33:33,222
Okay.

443
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:36,850
Well, I'll see you
after school, then.

444
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:48,445
Cheryl, I'm home.

445
00:33:49,363 --> 00:33:50,531
Honey?

446
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:57,162
Damn that Lucas Buck.

447
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:02,918
I want that damn thing
out of here. You hear me?

448
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:07,506
You mess with Lucas Buck,
and you're a dead man.

449
00:34:08,173 --> 00:34:10,801
Honey, listen, this thing
is getting out of control.

450
00:34:10,884 --> 00:34:13,512
Lucas Buck is a real man.
Cheryl, listen to me.

451
00:34:13,595 --> 00:34:16,557
He ain't nothing like you,
Danny boy.
What is wrong with you?

452
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:20,018
What, are you stupid?
Or do you just look that way?

453
00:34:20,102 --> 00:34:21,395
That's it.

454
00:34:23,188 --> 00:34:25,440
No, don't. Please.

455
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:28,652
No! No!

456
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:32,656
Don't, please! No, Daniel!

457
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,415
It's okay.

458
00:34:41,957 --> 00:34:43,542
It's okay, baby.

459
00:34:51,466 --> 00:34:54,052
I tried to stand up to him...

460
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,055
but he just kept
coming after me.

461
00:34:58,682 --> 00:35:00,893
And then he sent
that mirror...

462
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:05,772
then all this stuff
happened to us.

463
00:35:13,572 --> 00:35:16,491
He wants me to destroy Matt
at this hearing.

464
00:35:17,201 --> 00:35:18,827
And if I don't...

465
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:22,539
I'm gonna lose you.

466
00:35:32,424 --> 00:35:34,676
I don't know what to do, baby.

467
00:35:39,306 --> 00:35:41,266
I don't know what to do.

468
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:43,227
And how long...

469
00:35:43,268 --> 00:35:45,437
have you been with
the Charleston Post,
Ms. Emory?

470
00:35:45,521 --> 00:35:47,523
About seven years, Judge.

471
00:35:48,273 --> 00:35:50,150
It's the best job
in the world.

472
00:35:50,234 --> 00:35:53,445
But you'd be willing
to take on
this responsibility...

473
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:55,822
if I think that
this is the best thing
for Caleb?

474
00:35:55,906 --> 00:35:56,949
Yes.

475
00:35:57,616 --> 00:36:01,161
I can give you my
financial records, if...
No, that won't be necessary.

476
00:36:01,245 --> 00:36:04,623
I'm sure you make
a good living. Thank you,
Ms. Emory.

477
00:36:05,249 --> 00:36:07,376
Ms. Coombs?
Thank you, Judge.

478
00:36:07,543 --> 00:36:09,753
I'd just like to say,
for the record...

479
00:36:09,795 --> 00:36:12,631
that I admire
Ms. Emory tremendously.

480
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:15,467
I mean, when she told
my class about...

481
00:36:15,509 --> 00:36:17,678
living in a crack house
for two weeks...

482
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:21,640
just to do
a first-person story,
and how scary it was...

483
00:36:21,974 --> 00:36:24,142
they were all very impressed.

484
00:36:24,893 --> 00:36:27,813
I know I wouldn't have
that kind of courage.

485
00:36:28,564 --> 00:36:31,650
Thank you, Ms. Coombs.
May I say
something else, Judge?

486
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:33,527
As Caleb's teacher...

487
00:36:33,944 --> 00:36:38,282
I know that
he's a wonderful boy who needs
a firm hand of discipline...

488
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:42,119
and you won't find
a firmer hand
than Sheriff Buck.

489
00:36:43,328 --> 00:36:46,790
Before the Sheriff speaks,
perhaps we should hear
what the boy has to say.

490
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:49,251
Caleb, where would
you like to go?

491
00:36:54,923 --> 00:36:57,467
Guess I'd like to stay
with Dr. Matt.

492
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,554
Judge, may I?
Go ahead.

493
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:07,811
Judge, I'd like to guide
Dr. Truelane through some
important information...

494
00:37:07,895 --> 00:37:09,396
about his colleague,
Dr. Crower.

495
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:11,356
Why don't you just
ask me directly?

496
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:14,359
Because I follow
proper procedure. Don't you?

497
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:18,697
Now then, Dan, how long
have you known Dr. Crower?

498
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:24,995
Since he came to Trinity.
Six, seven months.

499
00:37:25,495 --> 00:37:26,872
Long enough, then.

500
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:30,459
You two ever
drive to work together?

501
00:37:31,877 --> 00:37:34,463
Car pool?
He doesn't have a car.

502
00:37:35,547 --> 00:37:36,757
Why not?

503
00:37:37,549 --> 00:37:40,177
How would I know?
Well, as your friend
and colleague...

504
00:37:40,219 --> 00:37:43,931
did he ever share
the reason with you
that he does not drive?

505
00:37:44,014 --> 00:37:45,015
No.

506
00:37:45,224 --> 00:37:47,976
You two ever go out
for drinks together?

507
00:37:48,644 --> 00:37:50,812
I don't drink.
What about Dr. Crower?

508
00:37:50,896 --> 00:37:55,067
I've never seen him drink.
He ever mention to you
a time when he did?

509
00:37:56,527 --> 00:37:58,070
I don't remember.

510
00:37:58,153 --> 00:38:00,572
At the hospital fundraiser,
maybe?

511
00:38:03,242 --> 00:38:04,326
Yeah.

512
00:38:05,661 --> 00:38:09,581
He told me how difficult
it had been for him
to quit drinking.

513
00:38:10,082 --> 00:38:13,252
Most people
can take it or leave it,
wouldn't you say?

514
00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:14,586
I guess so.

515
00:38:14,628 --> 00:38:18,382
But he found it hard to quit.
So that could only mean, what?

516
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:24,012
He's an alcoholic?
That's not for me to say.

517
00:38:24,555 --> 00:38:27,933
Could it be that Dr. Crower
advised you to treat
a Jacksonian epileptic...

518
00:38:28,016 --> 00:38:30,894
with a nearly fatal anesthesia
because he's still drinking?

519
00:38:30,936 --> 00:38:32,354
That's not for me to say.

520
00:38:32,437 --> 00:38:34,898
I see. So his drinking
doesn't affect his work?

521
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:36,942
I never said
he was an alcoholic.

522
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:38,986
Well, did he ever say it?

523
00:38:40,404 --> 00:38:42,906
Yes, but...
Then he's an
admitted alcoholic?

524
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:46,034
Yes, but he's sober now.
I mean, he hasn't had a drink
since...

525
00:38:46,118 --> 00:38:49,454
Since his wife
and daughter died?
No, you're twisting my words.

526
00:38:49,496 --> 00:38:51,123
How did they die?

527
00:38:52,124 --> 00:38:55,669
Didn't they die
in a twisted heap of metal on
the Massachusetts Turnpike...

528
00:38:55,752 --> 00:38:59,798
after the good doctor
had had too many Chablis
or martinis or whatever?

529
00:38:59,882 --> 00:39:02,134
Now, ain't that the truth?

530
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,138
Yes...

531
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:09,266
that's the truth.

532
00:39:11,476 --> 00:39:12,895
Well, now...

533
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:15,439
that's a tragedy.

534
00:39:17,232 --> 00:39:19,234
I guess that's it, Judge.

535
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,786
Well, now, Caleb...

536
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:33,707
you got yourself
some fine kinfolks
in your cousin, Ms. Emory.

537
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:38,504
And although she lives
in a very picturesque
and exciting world...

538
00:39:39,671 --> 00:39:42,925
I don't think
it's quite the one
for a 10-year-old boy.

539
00:39:43,008 --> 00:39:46,053
What about Dr. Matt?
The problem is...

540
00:39:46,512 --> 00:39:49,014
is a doctor works long hours.

541
00:39:49,473 --> 00:39:53,185
And a young boy needs somebody
to look after him full time.

542
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:56,563
That's why
I'm awarding custody...

543
00:39:56,647 --> 00:39:58,982
to someone well-known
in this community...

544
00:39:59,024 --> 00:40:02,110
and someone known
as a caretaker for the needy.

545
00:40:02,694 --> 00:40:06,448
A very fine person,
Ms. Loris Holt.
What?

546
00:40:06,698 --> 00:40:09,493
That's my decision for
Caleb's temporary custody...

547
00:40:09,535 --> 00:40:11,245
pending review by the state.

548
00:40:11,328 --> 00:40:14,831
Caleb, I want to thank you
for that soup you brought
over to me the other day.

549
00:40:14,873 --> 00:40:17,501
It made me feel better
than I've felt in a long time.

550
00:40:17,543 --> 00:40:20,379
Ms. Holt has a mighty fine
boarding house.

551
00:40:20,963 --> 00:40:24,424
She makes a mighty fine
cup of soup.
Yes, sir, she does.

552
00:40:24,591 --> 00:40:27,302
Now, you okay with that, son?
Yes, sir.

553
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,266
I want to thank all of you
for coming.

554
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:47,197
Daniel.

555
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,826
I don't blame you for this.

556
00:40:50,993 --> 00:40:54,162
You told the truth
and I won't forget about that.

557
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,207
Now go on back to your wife.

558
00:41:08,051 --> 00:41:10,846
Have you lost your mind?
Maybe.

559
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:15,100
We've had a long and mutually
profitable relationship,
Harris.

560
00:41:15,684 --> 00:41:17,060
Had, Lucas.

561
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:20,939
See, I've got
advanced prostate cancer.

562
00:41:22,357 --> 00:41:25,402
Maybe I should've started
my organic gardening
a little earlier.

563
00:41:25,444 --> 00:41:28,155
I see. Now you're worried
about meeting your maker...

564
00:41:28,238 --> 00:41:30,449
and all that hooey,
is that it?

565
00:41:30,991 --> 00:41:34,077
Least I'm off the hook
with you, Lucas.
Think so?

566
00:41:37,372 --> 00:41:39,291
I'll be the judge of that.

567
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:42,002
Soon as you're well enough
to be moved...

568
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:43,378
we're getting out of here.

569
00:41:46,381 --> 00:41:48,133
We'll go up north...

570
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:52,971
or down to Atlanta.

571
00:41:53,805 --> 00:41:54,932
Yeah.

572
00:41:56,141 --> 00:41:58,519
A buddy of mine
from med school...

573
00:41:59,144 --> 00:42:02,064
he got into
reconstructive surgery,
I'll give him a call, and...

574
00:42:02,147 --> 00:42:03,148
No.

575
00:42:06,401 --> 00:42:07,569
Honey?

576
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:14,076
I think I'm okay.

577
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,954
No, let me.

578
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:24,962
I don't believe it.

579
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:27,297
How do I look?

580
00:42:28,173 --> 00:42:29,925
You look beautiful.

581
00:42:30,634 --> 00:42:32,386
I don't want to run.

582
00:42:34,263 --> 00:42:36,139
We didn't do anything.

583
00:42:36,557 --> 00:42:38,475
You didn't do anything.

584
00:42:40,978 --> 00:42:44,523
I sold out a friend, Cheryl.
I know you told the truth.

585
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:49,319
If he's your friend,
he knows that.

586
00:42:52,281 --> 00:42:55,033
Give me a big piece, Rose.
You're greedy.

587
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:59,162
Better save some
for the other boarder.
The mystery boarder?

588
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:04,459
How about some cake?

589
00:43:05,043 --> 00:43:06,170
Okay.

590
00:43:08,547 --> 00:43:09,882
Thank you.

591
00:43:19,516 --> 00:43:22,186
So you're
the new mystery boarder.
Howdy.

592
00:43:27,399 --> 00:43:30,652
I picked up some stuff
on my way home to celebrate.

593
00:43:33,447 --> 00:43:34,781
Root beer?

594
00:43:39,578 --> 00:43:43,290
Is this what Yankees
eat at parties?
You calling me a Yankee?

595
00:43:43,373 --> 00:43:44,875
Well, you are.

596
00:43:45,584 --> 00:43:47,044
I guess I am.

597
00:43:48,003 --> 00:43:49,922
Is that a problem for you?
Nope.

598
00:43:50,005 --> 00:43:52,007
Good.
Where's your room?

599
00:43:52,591 --> 00:43:54,968
It's upstairs
in case you need me.

600
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,720
Only in case.

601
00:43:58,138 --> 00:44:00,933
Mine's up in the tower
in case you need me.

602
00:44:01,016 --> 00:44:02,476
Only in case.

603
00:44:21,411 --> 00:44:25,415
You gonna pray
to the Lord

604
00:44:25,457 --> 00:44:28,794
Oh, please deliver me

605
00:44:30,712 --> 00:44:33,048
What you gonna do

606
00:44:33,131 --> 00:44:37,678
When Death comes for you

607
00:45:10,502 --> 00:45:11,670
Caleb?

608
00:45:14,089 --> 00:45:16,383
Aren't you gonna
say good night?

609
00:45:16,466 --> 00:45:17,509
Hey.

610
00:45:18,635 --> 00:45:20,262
I got a new room.

611
00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:22,472
I can see that.

612
00:45:26,685 --> 00:45:29,938
Not mad at me anymore?
I never was.

613
00:45:41,116 --> 00:45:42,618
Open the door.

614
00:45:42,701 --> 00:45:44,786
And there's all the people.

615
00:45:56,882 --> 00:45:58,884
I can't feel you, Merlyn.

616
00:45:59,218 --> 00:46:01,011
Well, I can feel you.

617
00:46:01,887 --> 00:46:03,680
What do I feel like?

618
00:46:04,097 --> 00:46:05,516
Like family.

619
00:46:06,975 --> 00:46:08,685
Good night, Merlyn.

620
00:46:15,067 --> 00:46:16,401
Good night.
