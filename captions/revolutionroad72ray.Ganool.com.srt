1
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:45,614
- So, what do you do?
- I'm studying to be an actress. You?

2
00:01:45,741 --> 00:01:49,535
- I'm a longshoreman.
- No, I mean, really.

3
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,537
I mean really, too.

4
00:01:51,621 --> 00:01:52,705
Although, starting next Monday,

5
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:54,498
I'm doing something
a little more glamorous.

6
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:55,666
What's that?

7
00:01:55,751 --> 00:01:59,003
Night cashier at a cafeteria.

8
00:01:59,087 --> 00:02:03,924
I don't mean how you make money.
I mean, what are you interested in?

9
00:02:05,135 --> 00:02:07,470
Honey, if I had the answer to that one,

10
00:02:07,596 --> 00:02:10,681
I bet I'd bore us both to death
in half an hour.

11
00:02:50,722 --> 00:02:53,474
Thank God that's over.

12
00:02:54,393 --> 00:02:57,645
So much for the debut
of the Laurel Players.

13
00:02:58,522 --> 00:03:00,981
And she was very disappointing.

14
00:03:08,365 --> 00:03:12,576
- Frank! Very nice, Frank!
- Thanks so much, Mrs Givings.

15
00:03:12,661 --> 00:03:16,247
I can't tell you how much we enjoyed it.
You have a very talented wife.

16
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:18,541
I'll pass it along.

17
00:03:30,387 --> 00:03:33,264
- Frank!
- Hi!

18
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,934
She's in there.
I'm about ready for that drink.

19
00:03:37,018 --> 00:03:38,894
Couple of minutes.

20
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,739
April? Sweetheart?

21
00:03:53,743 --> 00:03:55,161
- Hi.
- Hi.

22
00:03:56,246 --> 00:03:57,997
- You about ready to leave?
- Yeah. Yeah.

23
00:03:58,081 --> 00:04:00,958
I've just got to get this makeup off.

24
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:11,469
Well, I guess it wasn't a triumph
or anything, was it?

25
00:04:14,097 --> 00:04:19,935
- I guess not. I'll be ready in a minute.
- Take your time.

26
00:04:22,856 --> 00:04:24,815
Listen, will you do me a favour?

27
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,860
Milly and Shep wanted us
to go out with them after.

28
00:04:27,944 --> 00:04:31,447
Will you say we can't? Say it's because
of the babysitter or something.

29
00:04:31,531 --> 00:04:33,491
Well, the thing is,
I already said that we could.

30
00:04:33,575 --> 00:04:35,576
I mean, I just saw them
and I said that we would.

31
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,786
Then would you mind going out again
and saying you were mistaken?

32
00:04:37,871 --> 00:04:38,996
That should be simple enough.

33
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,873
Don't you think
that's a little bit rude, April?

34
00:04:40,957 --> 00:04:43,792
- Then I'll tell them myself.
- Okay. Okay. Take it easy.

35
00:04:43,877 --> 00:04:45,961
All right? I'll tell them.

36
00:05:27,546 --> 00:05:30,881
I mean it, baby.
You were the only person in that play.

37
00:05:30,966 --> 00:05:32,466
Thank you.

38
00:05:35,011 --> 00:05:38,013
We shouldn't have let you get
mixed up in the damned thing, is all.

39
00:05:38,098 --> 00:05:39,515
All right.

40
00:05:40,225 --> 00:05:43,894
What a bunch of amateurs. I mean,
you've studied, for Christ's sake.

41
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:45,354
Could we stop talking about it now?

42
00:05:45,438 --> 00:05:46,480
Sure.

43
00:05:48,483 --> 00:05:50,943
I just don't want you
feeling bad about it, that's all.

44
00:05:51,027 --> 00:05:53,112
Because it's not worth it, you know.

45
00:05:53,196 --> 00:05:56,824
It's bad enough having to live out
here amongst these people...

46
00:05:56,908 --> 00:05:59,118
- What'd you say?
- I said yes. All right, Frank.

47
00:05:59,202 --> 00:06:04,248
Could you just stop talking about it now
before you drive me crazy, please?

48
00:06:08,503 --> 00:06:10,212
What are you doing?

49
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,516
April, sweetheart,
let's talk about this, okay?

50
00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:25,352
- No, Frank, please don't do that.
- Come on, now.

51
00:06:25,437 --> 00:06:27,354
- Don't touch me.
- April. April...

52
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:29,982
Just leave me alone.

53
00:06:36,448 --> 00:06:38,449
Okay. Okay.

54
00:06:39,451 --> 00:06:43,621
It strikes me that there's a considerable
amount of bullshit going on here.

55
00:06:43,705 --> 00:06:46,790
And there's just a few things
that I'd like to clear up. All right?

56
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:51,503
Number one, it's not my fault
that the play was lousy. Okay?

57
00:06:51,588 --> 00:06:53,881
Number two,
it sure as hell isn't my fault

58
00:06:53,965 --> 00:06:56,342
that you didn't turn out to be an actress,

59
00:06:56,426 --> 00:06:58,761
and the sooner you get over
that little piece of soap opera,

60
00:06:58,845 --> 00:07:00,054
the better off we're both going to be.

61
00:07:00,138 --> 00:07:02,848
Number three,
I don't happen to fit the role

62
00:07:02,932 --> 00:07:05,851
of dumb, insensitive suburban husband.

63
00:07:05,935 --> 00:07:08,979
You've been trying to lay that crap
on me ever since we moved out here.

64
00:07:09,064 --> 00:07:10,356
And I'm damned if I'll wear it.

65
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,444
Number four... April? April!

66
00:07:17,572 --> 00:07:18,739
April.

67
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,367
What the hell are you doing?
Get back in the car.

68
00:07:21,451 --> 00:07:25,162
No. I will in a minute.
Just let me stand here for a second.

69
00:07:25,246 --> 00:07:26,872
God damn it!

70
00:07:30,251 --> 00:07:34,046
April, can you please just get back
in the car and talk about this

71
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,589
instead of running all over Route 12?

72
00:07:35,674 --> 00:07:38,300
Haven't I made it clear I don't
particularly want to talk about it?

73
00:07:38,385 --> 00:07:40,177
Okay. I mean, Jesus,
I'm trying to be nice

74
00:07:40,261 --> 00:07:42,262
about this thing here, for God's sake.

75
00:07:42,347 --> 00:07:45,432
How kind of you.
How terribly, terribly kind of you.

76
00:07:45,517 --> 00:07:47,017
Wait a minute. I don't deserve this.

77
00:07:47,102 --> 00:07:48,727
You're always so wonderfully definite

78
00:07:48,812 --> 00:07:50,521
on the subject of what you do
and don't deserve.

79
00:07:50,605 --> 00:07:55,150
Wait a minute! Wait a goddamn... April!
Now you listen to me.

80
00:07:55,235 --> 00:07:57,194
This is one time
you're not going to get away

81
00:07:57,278 --> 00:07:59,363
with twisting everything that I say, April.

82
00:07:59,447 --> 00:08:01,615
This just happens to be
one goddamn time

83
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,409
I know I'm not in the wrong here.

84
00:08:03,493 --> 00:08:04,993
Christ, I wish
you'd stayed home tonight.

85
00:08:05,078 --> 00:08:06,370
You know what you are
when you're like this, April?

86
00:08:06,454 --> 00:08:07,871
You're sick. I really mean that.

87
00:08:07,956 --> 00:08:10,332
- You're sick! What?
- And do you know what you are?

88
00:08:10,417 --> 00:08:11,750
- You're disgusting.
- Oh, yeah?

89
00:08:11,835 --> 00:08:13,127
You don't fool me, Frank.

90
00:08:13,211 --> 00:08:15,295
Just because you've got me safely
in this little trap,

91
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,881
you think you can bully me into feeling
whatever you want me to feel!

92
00:08:17,966 --> 00:08:20,509
- You in a trap? You in a trap?
- Yes! Yes! Me, Frank!

93
00:08:20,593 --> 00:08:23,512
- Jesus Christ, don't make me laugh!
- Me!

94
00:08:23,596 --> 00:08:27,099
You pathetic, self-deluded little boy.
Look at you!

95
00:08:27,183 --> 00:08:30,769
Look at you and tell me, how by any
stretch of the imagination

96
00:08:30,854 --> 00:08:33,021
you can call yourself a man?

97
00:08:35,734 --> 00:08:36,900
Damn it!

98
00:08:37,736 --> 00:08:39,278
Jesus Christ!

99
00:08:55,044 --> 00:09:00,048
- Don't look at me like that, April.
- Could we please go home now?

100
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,134
Fifteenth floor.

101
00:11:19,188 --> 00:11:23,567
I'm going to need your help
this morning, Old Scout.

102
00:11:23,651 --> 00:11:28,155
For the next few hours, you're to warn
me of Bandy's every approach

103
00:11:28,281 --> 00:11:30,407
and you may need to shield me
from public view

104
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:34,119
in the likely event I void my stomach.

105
00:11:34,203 --> 00:11:35,704
It's that bad.

106
00:11:35,788 --> 00:11:37,831
Good morning, Jack.

107
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:40,208
Nothing good about it, I assure you.

108
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:04,274
Of course, I knew the moment
you stepped off the train

109
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:05,359
what you were looking for.

110
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:09,363
A small remodelled barn,
or a carriage house.

111
00:12:09,447 --> 00:12:11,323
And I just hate to be
the one to tell you that sort of thing

112
00:12:11,407 --> 00:12:13,951
just isn't available any more.

113
00:12:14,035 --> 00:12:16,578
But I don't want you to despair.

114
00:12:16,663 --> 00:12:20,248
There is one place up here
I want to show you.

115
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,419
Now, of course, it isn't very desirable
at this end.

116
00:12:24,504 --> 00:12:28,090
As you can see, Crawford Road
is mostly these little cinder-blocky,

117
00:12:28,174 --> 00:12:31,176
pick-up trucky places,
plumbers, carpenters,

118
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,387
little local people of that sort.

119
00:12:33,471 --> 00:12:34,972
But eventually...

120
00:12:35,056 --> 00:12:39,434
Eventually it leads up to Revolutionary
Road, which is much nicer.

121
00:12:40,061 --> 00:12:41,770
Now, the place I want to show you

122
00:12:41,854 --> 00:12:45,399
is a sweet little house
and a sweet little setting.

123
00:12:45,483 --> 00:12:50,278
Simple, clean lines, good lawns,
marvellous for children.

124
00:12:50,363 --> 00:12:52,781
It's just around this next curve.

125
00:12:53,449 --> 00:12:59,913
Now, you'll see it. There.
See the little white one? Sweet, isn't it?

126
00:13:00,498 --> 00:13:05,836
The perky way it sits there on
its little slope? Charming, isn't it?

127
00:13:08,381 --> 00:13:09,589
Oh, yes.

128
00:13:20,643 --> 00:13:22,144
You wanted to see me?

129
00:13:22,228 --> 00:13:25,522
Came for you from Toledo this morning.
This is the third one this month.

130
00:13:25,606 --> 00:13:27,357
Sorry. I thought I'd taken care of...

131
00:13:27,442 --> 00:13:29,443
I'm not prepared to have this
conversation again, Frank.

132
00:13:29,527 --> 00:13:31,570
- You understand?
- I was literally just getting into...

133
00:13:31,654 --> 00:13:35,032
These folks in the provinces look up
to us. We need to be efficient.

134
00:13:35,116 --> 00:13:37,826
We can't have this
kind of back and forth, and so forth.

135
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:42,706
- It's just not efficient. Am I right?
- Yes.

136
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:47,044
- What was that about?
- Toledo.

137
00:13:47,587 --> 00:13:49,629
Branch manager wants
a revised brochure

138
00:13:49,714 --> 00:13:52,549
for the conference on the Knox 500.

139
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:55,802
"It's just not efficient. Am I right?
Am I right? Am I right?"

140
00:13:56,554 --> 00:13:58,138
Sounds like a goodie.

141
00:13:58,222 --> 00:14:01,641
For God's sake. I don't even know what
the Knox 500 does. Do you?

142
00:14:01,726 --> 00:14:03,477
Don't insult me.

143
00:14:17,325 --> 00:14:22,913
If you'll look in the inactive file
under SP 1109,

144
00:14:22,997 --> 00:14:26,291
you'll find copies of all the stuff we sent
to the agency,

145
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:31,797
that way we can trace the thing back
to its original sources.

146
00:14:35,218 --> 00:14:38,345
Listen, I hope you weren't planning
on having an early lunch.

147
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:41,973
No. I'm not really hungry.

148
00:14:42,058 --> 00:14:44,392
Good. I'll check on you later then.
All right?

149
00:14:44,477 --> 00:14:45,936
- Okay.
- Okay.

150
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:53,026
You know something, Maureen?

151
00:14:54,362 --> 00:14:56,363
You're lucky you met me.

152
00:14:57,657 --> 00:14:59,116
How's that?

153
00:15:01,327 --> 00:15:03,662
I think I can show you the ropes,
you know.

154
00:15:03,746 --> 00:15:09,459
There's a certain art to survival at Knox.
Really. Let me show you what I mean.

155
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:15,173
Waiter. Bring me the telephone,
would you? And two more martinis.

156
00:15:16,175 --> 00:15:17,217
Wow.

157
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,561
Klondike 5-55-66, please.

158
00:15:29,772 --> 00:15:32,816
Hello, Mrs Jorgensen?
Frank Wheeler here. Yes.

159
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,027
I just wanted to let you know
that I've had to send Maureen Grube

160
00:15:36,112 --> 00:15:38,321
down to Visual Aids for me.

161
00:15:38,406 --> 00:15:41,950
I'll probably need her
the rest of the afternoon. Yes.

162
00:15:43,077 --> 00:15:45,370
You, too. Take care now.

163
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:56,631
- I never even heard of Visual Aids.
- That's because it doesn't exist.

164
00:16:17,904 --> 00:16:20,530
Hi, Helen. Come on in.

165
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,490
I can't stay a minute.

166
00:16:22,575 --> 00:16:25,452
I just wanted to bring
these sedum plantings

167
00:16:25,536 --> 00:16:28,622
for that messy patch
down by the foot of the drive.

168
00:16:28,706 --> 00:16:30,498
It's like the European houseleek,

169
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:34,211
only these have the most marvellous
little yellow blossoms.

170
00:16:34,921 --> 00:16:36,421
Now, all it wants for the first few days

171
00:16:36,505 --> 00:16:40,175
is just a tiny dollop of water,
and then you'll find it absolutely thrives.

172
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:43,261
Well, thank you, Helen.
That's so kind of you.

173
00:16:44,096 --> 00:16:46,181
Would you like some coffee?

174
00:16:57,652 --> 00:17:00,195
Is there something
I can do for you, Helen?

175
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:02,656
I almost forgot.

176
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:06,368
There is one small favour
I would like to ask.

177
00:17:06,452 --> 00:17:13,416
It's about... It's about my son, John.
He's been in the hospital.

178
00:17:13,918 --> 00:17:15,877
I'm sorry. Is everything all right?

179
00:17:15,962 --> 00:17:21,967
Well, actually, just for the time being,
he's in Pleasant Brook. Psychiatric.

180
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,349
- Oh, I see.
- Well, it's nothing serious.

181
00:17:29,684 --> 00:17:35,021
He just got a little run down. Things can
just get the better of us sometimes.

182
00:17:35,106 --> 00:17:39,067
- Don't you agree?
- Yes. Of course.

183
00:17:39,694 --> 00:17:41,444
It's a marvellous facility

184
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:44,406
and the treatments
seem to be doing wonders for him.

185
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,117
Anyway, they said getting him out
for an afternoon

186
00:17:47,201 --> 00:17:49,703
might do him a little bit of good.

187
00:17:49,787 --> 00:17:53,748
I think he finds my friends
a little conventional, quite frankly.

188
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:59,087
I mean, he's travelled.
He has a Ph.D. In mathematics.

189
00:17:59,588 --> 00:18:03,049
I suppose you could say
he's an intellectual.

190
00:18:04,635 --> 00:18:07,971
It would do him a world of good
to meet a young couple like you.

191
00:18:08,055 --> 00:18:10,223
Well, we'd love to meet him.

192
00:18:12,643 --> 00:18:15,186
- Really?
- Yes.

193
00:18:15,771 --> 00:18:17,314
We'd love to.

194
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,734
Thank you, dear.

195
00:18:23,237 --> 00:18:24,612
Thank you.

196
00:18:28,117 --> 00:18:30,160
Well, I must be off.

197
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,215
I remember the first day
you came off the train.

198
00:18:44,342 --> 00:18:47,761
You weren't like my other clients.
You were different.

199
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:52,182
You just seemed special.

200
00:18:57,521 --> 00:18:58,938
Of course, you still are.

201
00:19:00,858 --> 00:19:05,403
Remember, just a dollop. I must scoot.
Toodle-oo.

202
00:19:10,534 --> 00:19:11,534
Bye.

203
00:19:28,803 --> 00:19:31,179
I think you got me a little drunk.

204
00:19:38,646 --> 00:19:41,022
You know what today is?

205
00:19:41,107 --> 00:19:42,357
Monday?

206
00:19:44,652 --> 00:19:49,614
It's my birthday. I'm 30 years old today.

207
00:19:50,616 --> 00:19:52,700
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

208
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:04,212
What was the name of that department
you made up again?

209
00:20:10,261 --> 00:20:12,429
Visual Aids.

210
00:20:14,181 --> 00:20:15,598
What a joke.

211
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:22,480
What a joke. Oh, my.

212
00:20:25,109 --> 00:20:28,194
- You want to hear a real joke?
- Yes.

213
00:20:31,031 --> 00:20:33,867
- My old man worked at Knox.
- Yeah?

214
00:20:35,453 --> 00:20:37,704
He was a salesman in Yonkers.

215
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:45,253
Once a year he used to take me
into the city for lunch.

216
00:20:45,379 --> 00:20:49,174
It was supposed to be a very special,
life-advice sort of occasion.

217
00:20:49,258 --> 00:20:52,260
- Nice.
- No. Not really.

218
00:20:54,472 --> 00:20:56,723
I used to sit there and think,

219
00:20:59,143 --> 00:21:02,061
"I hope to Christ I don't end up like you."

220
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:10,403
Now, here I am,
a 30-year-old Knox man.

221
00:21:12,907 --> 00:21:14,657
Can you beat that?

222
00:21:16,744 --> 00:21:18,953
I think I kind of lost you...

223
00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:24,417
Your father worked for Knox?

224
00:21:24,502 --> 00:21:30,924
I'm sorry, everything's just kind of
going out of focus.

225
00:21:37,306 --> 00:21:42,018
Why don't we get some air,
you and me?

226
00:22:21,267 --> 00:22:22,725
Is this you?

227
00:22:24,895 --> 00:22:26,062
Yeah.

228
00:22:26,146 --> 00:22:30,024
- You been to Paris?
- I've never really been anywhere.

229
00:22:30,442 --> 00:22:33,236
Maybe I'll take you with me then.

230
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,155
I'm going back the first chance I get,
I tell you.

231
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,866
People are alive there. Not like here.

232
00:22:47,001 --> 00:22:51,337
All I know, April, is I want to feel things.

233
00:22:53,132 --> 00:22:56,509
Really feel them, you know.

234
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:00,763
How's that for an ambition?

235
00:23:02,516 --> 00:23:09,355
Frank Wheeler? I think you're the most
interesting person I've ever met.

236
00:23:16,697 --> 00:23:21,367
I guess this wasn't what you had in mind
when you went to work this morning?

237
00:23:21,619 --> 00:23:23,661
No. It certainly wasn't.

238
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:45,224
Do you have a cigarette, Frank?

239
00:23:46,894 --> 00:23:48,227
Yeah, sure.

240
00:23:56,195 --> 00:23:57,695
There you go.

241
00:24:00,074 --> 00:24:02,492
Can I get you a drink or anything?

242
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:05,328
No thanks, Maureen. Actually, it's...

243
00:24:05,412 --> 00:24:09,415
It's getting kind of late.
I guess I'd better be cutting out.

244
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:15,630
Gee, that's right.
Did you miss your train?

245
00:24:15,714 --> 00:24:18,466
That's all right, I'll catch the next one.

246
00:24:19,843 --> 00:24:22,595
Listen, you were swell.

247
00:24:30,062 --> 00:24:31,604
Take care now.

248
00:25:05,806 --> 00:25:09,016
- Frank.
- Why are you all dressed up?

249
00:25:09,643 --> 00:25:13,521
First of all, I missed you all day
and I want to say I'm sorry.

250
00:25:14,231 --> 00:25:17,316
I'm sorry for the way I've been
since the play.

251
00:25:17,651 --> 00:25:21,070
I'm sorry for everything, and I love you.

252
00:25:23,657 --> 00:25:25,158
The rest can wait.

253
00:25:25,242 --> 00:25:31,080
Now, you just wait here
till I call you. Okay?

254
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,665
Okay.

255
00:25:42,301 --> 00:25:44,969
All right, Frank. You can come in now.

256
00:25:59,276 --> 00:26:05,865
Happy birthday to you

257
00:26:05,949 --> 00:26:10,328
Happy birthday, dear Daddy

258
00:26:10,412 --> 00:26:14,332
Happy birthday to you

259
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,711
Happy birthday, darling.

260
00:26:18,921 --> 00:26:21,756
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you, too.

261
00:26:38,482 --> 00:26:39,649
Frank.

262
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,535
Frank. I have had
the most wonderful idea.

263
00:26:51,912 --> 00:26:55,498
- I've been thinking about it all day.
- Baby, what's all this about?

264
00:26:55,582 --> 00:26:57,625
Do you know how much money
we have saved?

265
00:26:57,751 --> 00:27:00,920
Enough to live on for six months
without you earning another dime.

266
00:27:01,088 --> 00:27:04,173
And with the money we could get from
the house and the car, longer than that.

267
00:27:04,258 --> 00:27:06,133
"What we could get for the house"?

268
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,720
Sweetheart, what are you talking about?
Where are we going to live?

269
00:27:11,056 --> 00:27:12,223
Paris.

270
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,350
What?

271
00:27:14,434 --> 00:27:16,602
You always said it was the only place
you'd ever been

272
00:27:16,687 --> 00:27:20,356
that you wanted to go back to,
the only place that was worth living.

273
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,024
So why don't we go there?

274
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:26,404
- You're serious?
- Yes. What's stopping us?

275
00:27:26,947 --> 00:27:30,408
What's stopping us? Well, I can think
of a number of different things.

276
00:27:30,492 --> 00:27:34,245
For example, what kind of a job
could I possibly get?

277
00:27:34,329 --> 00:27:38,791
You won't be getting any
kind of a job, because I will.

278
00:27:39,126 --> 00:27:40,710
Oh, right, right.

279
00:27:40,794 --> 00:27:43,170
Don't laugh at me. Listen a minute.

280
00:27:43,338 --> 00:27:46,090
Do you know what they pay
for secretarial positions

281
00:27:46,174 --> 00:27:48,259
- in government agencies in Europe?
- No, I don't.

282
00:27:48,343 --> 00:27:51,429
Listen, Frank, I'm serious about this.
Do you think I'm kidding or something?

283
00:27:51,513 --> 00:27:54,056
Okay, okay.
I just have a couple of questions, is all.

284
00:27:54,141 --> 00:27:56,851
For one thing, what exactly
am I supposed to be doing

285
00:27:56,935 --> 00:27:59,228
while you're out earning all this money?

286
00:27:59,313 --> 00:28:03,190
Don't you see? That's the whole idea.

287
00:28:03,483 --> 00:28:06,944
You'll be doing what you should've
been allowed to do seven years ago.

288
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:08,779
You'll have time.

289
00:28:08,989 --> 00:28:11,073
For the first time in your life
you'll have time to find out

290
00:28:11,158 --> 00:28:13,409
what it is that you actually want to do.

291
00:28:13,493 --> 00:28:14,911
And when you figure it out,

292
00:28:14,995 --> 00:28:18,456
you'll have the time and the freedom
to start doing it.

293
00:28:21,627 --> 00:28:24,921
Sweetheart, it's just
not very realistic, is all.

294
00:28:29,217 --> 00:28:33,179
No, Frank. This is what's unrealistic.

295
00:28:34,181 --> 00:28:37,850
It's unrealistic for a man
with a fine mind to go on working

296
00:28:37,976 --> 00:28:40,603
year after year at a job he can't stand,

297
00:28:40,687 --> 00:28:42,480
coming home to a place he can't stand,

298
00:28:42,564 --> 00:28:46,651
to a wife who's equally unable to stand
the same things.

299
00:28:47,527 --> 00:28:50,029
Do you want to know the worst part?

300
00:28:51,031 --> 00:28:54,492
Our whole existence here
is based on this great premise

301
00:28:54,576 --> 00:28:58,829
that we're special and superior
to the whole thing.

302
00:28:59,164 --> 00:29:00,706
But we're not.

303
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:03,417
We're just like everyone else.

304
00:29:03,502 --> 00:29:07,380
Look at us. We've bought into
the same ridiculous delusion.

305
00:29:07,589 --> 00:29:09,674
This idea that
you have to resign from life

306
00:29:09,758 --> 00:29:12,718
and settle down the moment
you have children.

307
00:29:14,096 --> 00:29:16,639
And we've been
punishing each other for it.

308
00:29:16,723 --> 00:29:19,767
Listen, we decided to move out here.

309
00:29:19,893 --> 00:29:21,811
No one forced me
to take the job at Knox.

310
00:29:21,895 --> 00:29:24,689
I mean, whoever said I was meant
to be a big deal, anyway?

311
00:29:24,773 --> 00:29:28,943
When I first met you, there was nothing
in the world you couldn't do or be.

312
00:29:29,027 --> 00:29:30,861
When you first met me
I was a little wise guy

313
00:29:30,946 --> 00:29:31,988
with a big mouth, that's all.

314
00:29:32,072 --> 00:29:35,116
You were not.
How can you even say that?

315
00:29:37,369 --> 00:29:41,247
Okay. Okay, so I'll have time.

316
00:29:41,415 --> 00:29:44,959
And God knows that's appealing.
It's very appealing.

317
00:29:45,085 --> 00:29:47,336
And everything you're saying
makes sense

318
00:29:47,421 --> 00:29:50,506
if I had a definite talent,
if I were a writer or an artist.

319
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:53,217
No. But, Frank, listen. Listen to me.

320
00:29:53,593 --> 00:29:56,137
It's what you are that's being stifled.

321
00:29:56,221 --> 00:30:00,641
It's what you are that's being denied
and denied in this kind of life.

322
00:30:03,103 --> 00:30:04,770
And what's that?

323
00:30:07,607 --> 00:30:09,233
Don't you know?

324
00:30:11,653 --> 00:30:15,448
You're the most beautiful
and wonderful thing in the world.

325
00:30:19,494 --> 00:30:21,078
You're a man.

326
00:30:39,931 --> 00:30:45,728
This is our chance, Frank.
This is our one chance.

327
00:30:51,568 --> 00:30:52,693
Okay.

328
00:30:56,615 --> 00:30:57,823
Okay?

329
00:31:00,202 --> 00:31:03,621
Why not? Why the hell not?

330
00:31:27,229 --> 00:31:29,897
- Good morning, all.
- Morning, Frank.

331
00:31:29,981 --> 00:31:32,191
Franklin. Good to see your shining face.

332
00:31:32,275 --> 00:31:37,196
- What's the news?
- Fellas, I'm moving to Paris.

333
00:31:39,282 --> 00:31:41,826
Indeed. And I'm moving to Tangiers.

334
00:31:59,803 --> 00:32:02,138
Intra-company letter to Toledo.

335
00:32:02,222 --> 00:32:06,892
Attention B.F. Chalmers,
Branch Manager.

336
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,689
With regard to recent and repeated
correspondence,

337
00:32:11,773 --> 00:32:14,483
this is to advise
that the matter has been

338
00:32:14,568 --> 00:32:17,736
very satisfactorily taken in hand, period.

339
00:32:17,821 --> 00:32:23,117
Paragraph. We wholly agree that
the existing brochure is unsuitable.

340
00:32:23,994 --> 00:32:26,745
To this end, we have developed, quote,

341
00:32:32,586 --> 00:32:35,421
"Speaking of Production Control."

342
00:32:44,764 --> 00:32:49,435
Here you go, Mrs Wheeler. These are
the traveller's cheques you requested.

343
00:32:49,603 --> 00:32:52,062
- Yes.
- Your steamer reservations.

344
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,066
These I'll pass on
to the embassy for you.

345
00:32:56,151 --> 00:32:58,027
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

346
00:33:02,574 --> 00:33:05,242
September. October at the outside.

347
00:33:07,162 --> 00:33:08,871
I just happen to think
people are better off

348
00:33:08,955 --> 00:33:11,498
doing some kind of work
they actually like.

349
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:14,585
- Right. Right, yes.
- Absolutely, absolutely.

350
00:33:14,669 --> 00:33:20,174
But, I mean, assuming there is
this true vocation waiting for you,

351
00:33:20,508 --> 00:33:24,386
wouldn't you be just as likely
to discover it here as there?

352
00:33:26,264 --> 00:33:28,724
I don't think it's possible
to discover anything

353
00:33:28,808 --> 00:33:32,186
on the 15th floor of the Knox building,

354
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,939
and I don't think any of you do either.

355
00:34:34,332 --> 00:34:36,125
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

356
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:40,546
- Michael.
- Daddy, will you read us...

357
00:34:41,089 --> 00:34:46,176
...all the way to here.

358
00:34:46,803 --> 00:34:50,222
We have to take a big boat ride
across the sea to get there.

359
00:34:50,307 --> 00:34:54,768
- But I won't know anybody there.
- I know. I know. Neither will I.

360
00:34:55,603 --> 00:34:57,813
But remember how you felt
when you started school?

361
00:34:57,897 --> 00:35:00,524
And now look
how many friends you have.

362
00:35:00,608 --> 00:35:04,278
You'll never guess
what they eat in Paris.

363
00:35:04,404 --> 00:35:06,655
- You'll never guess.
- What?

364
00:35:07,324 --> 00:35:09,825
- Slimy snails.
- Snails?

365
00:35:09,909 --> 00:35:12,911
Slimy snails and icky frog's legs.

366
00:35:25,467 --> 00:35:28,260
Milly, where are you, doll?

367
00:35:29,179 --> 00:35:32,139
You better get changed,
they'll be here soon.

368
00:35:33,141 --> 00:35:36,310
- Is that what you're wearing?
- Don't you like it?

369
00:35:36,895 --> 00:35:40,189
Yeah, yeah. You look great, doll.

370
00:35:41,691 --> 00:35:43,650
Guess I better haul ass.

371
00:36:00,335 --> 00:36:01,710
Hiya, gang.

372
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,717
What you watching?

373
00:36:48,258 --> 00:36:49,341
Shep?

374
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:54,179
I was calling you and calling you.

375
00:36:57,183 --> 00:36:58,183
Hi.

376
00:37:04,649 --> 00:37:08,026
Here we go. Just a little something.

377
00:37:09,571 --> 00:37:15,409
- Those look great. I'm starving.
- April, I can't get over it,

378
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:19,079
you look like the cat that ate the canary.

379
00:37:19,205 --> 00:37:23,542
Do you have something to tell us?
Just a little bit of news?

380
00:37:23,751 --> 00:37:27,880
Well, actually, Milly, we... Well, we do
have some important news, yes.

381
00:37:28,006 --> 00:37:29,339
I knew it.

382
00:37:29,966 --> 00:37:32,801
Honey, why don't you tell them?
Go ahead.

383
00:37:34,804 --> 00:37:38,056
We're going to Europe. To Paris.

384
00:37:42,979 --> 00:37:44,229
To live.

385
00:37:48,026 --> 00:37:50,194
- What?
- When?

386
00:37:50,278 --> 00:37:53,739
- In September.
- But what for?

387
00:37:55,283 --> 00:37:59,870
What for?
Well, because we've always wanted to.

388
00:37:59,954 --> 00:38:02,831
Because the kids are young enough.
Because it's beautiful.

389
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:06,210
I mean, really.
Shep, you've been there, you tell her.

390
00:38:06,294 --> 00:38:08,587
- Yeah, it's a great city.
- Yeah.

391
00:38:15,929 --> 00:38:18,305
When did you make this decision?

392
00:38:20,058 --> 00:38:22,559
About a week ago?
It's hard to remember.

393
00:38:22,644 --> 00:38:24,686
We just suddenly decided to go,
that's all.

394
00:38:24,771 --> 00:38:28,941
- About a week ago, you tell us now.
- We had to get used to the idea.

395
00:38:29,025 --> 00:38:32,027
So, what's the deal, Frank?
You get a job over there, or what?

396
00:38:32,111 --> 00:38:36,240
- No, no. Not exactly.
- What do you mean, "Not exactly"?

397
00:38:38,535 --> 00:38:42,287
Frank won't be getting
any kind of a job, because I will.

398
00:38:46,084 --> 00:38:47,834
So what are you going to do, Frank?

399
00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:51,171
I'm going to study.
And I'm going to read.

400
00:38:51,923 --> 00:38:56,218
I suppose I'm going to finally figure out
what I want to do with my life, Shep.

401
00:38:56,302 --> 00:38:58,220
While she supports you?

402
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:01,598
Yes. While she supports me.

403
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:04,476
In the beginning.

404
00:39:04,769 --> 00:39:07,563
You wouldn't believe what they pay
for secretarial work

405
00:39:07,647 --> 00:39:09,565
in those government agencies
over there.

406
00:39:09,649 --> 00:39:12,317
NATO and ECA and those places.

407
00:39:13,444 --> 00:39:15,112
And the cost of living
is dirt cheap, right?

408
00:39:15,196 --> 00:39:16,738
It's so cheap.

409
00:39:18,783 --> 00:39:21,618
The truth is we just need
something different.

410
00:39:21,703 --> 00:39:25,414
We're not getting any younger and
we don't want life to just pass us by.

411
00:39:25,498 --> 00:39:26,999
That's right.

412
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:30,711
Gee, it sounds wonderful, kids.

413
00:39:31,421 --> 00:39:34,840
I mean it. It really sounds wonderful.

414
00:39:34,924 --> 00:39:37,092
- Thank you, Milly.
- Oh, Milly.

415
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:40,721
We'll certainly miss you both.
Won't we, sweetie? Golly.

416
00:39:40,805 --> 00:39:42,514
- Sure.
- We'll miss you, too.

417
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:43,640
- Of course.
- Truly.

418
00:39:43,725 --> 00:39:45,809
We should have a toast or something.
To Paris.

419
00:39:45,893 --> 00:39:47,144
- To Paris.
- To Paris.

420
00:39:47,228 --> 00:39:48,478
To Paris.

421
00:39:49,981 --> 00:39:51,648
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

422
00:40:05,038 --> 00:40:06,997
You know what I think?

423
00:40:07,749 --> 00:40:08,874
What?

424
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:12,502
I think this whole plan
sounds a little immature.

425
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:15,297
Oh, God, I am so relieved.

426
00:40:17,634 --> 00:40:20,302
Me, too.
I was thinking that the whole time.

427
00:40:20,386 --> 00:40:21,928
I mean, what kind of man
is going to sit around

428
00:40:22,013 --> 00:40:23,805
in his bathrobe all day picking his nose

429
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:26,350
- while his wife goes out and works?
- I don't know, Shep.

430
00:40:26,434 --> 00:40:28,143
I just don't know.

431
00:40:34,734 --> 00:40:36,443
Why are you crying?

432
00:40:38,821 --> 00:40:40,530
What's the matter?

433
00:40:44,869 --> 00:40:48,372
It's nothing. I'm just so relieved.

434
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,500
Shep.

435
00:40:51,584 --> 00:40:58,006
Don't cry. Please. It's all right.
Everything's going to be all right.

436
00:41:00,426 --> 00:41:05,514
My God, their faces! Oh, God.

437
00:41:07,016 --> 00:41:08,183
Oh, God!

438
00:41:09,018 --> 00:41:11,895
You know what this is like,
April, honestly?

439
00:41:12,855 --> 00:41:13,939
Just talking like this?

440
00:41:14,023 --> 00:41:17,776
The whole idea of going off
to Europe this way?

441
00:41:17,944 --> 00:41:21,905
This is the way I felt going up to the line
the first time, in the war.

442
00:41:21,989 --> 00:41:24,866
I mean, I was probably
just as scared as everyone else,

443
00:41:24,951 --> 00:41:28,370
but inside I never felt better.

444
00:41:28,454 --> 00:41:32,457
I felt alive. I felt full of blood. I felt...

445
00:41:33,668 --> 00:41:36,002
Everything just...
Everything seemed more real.

446
00:41:36,087 --> 00:41:37,796
The guys in their uniforms.

447
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:42,592
The snow on the fields, the trees.
And all of us just walking.

448
00:41:43,636 --> 00:41:46,388
I mean, I was scared, of course.

449
00:41:46,472 --> 00:41:51,435
But I just kept thinking,
"This is it, you know. This is the truth."

450
00:41:55,523 --> 00:41:57,566
I felt that way once, too.

451
00:41:58,985 --> 00:42:00,152
When?

452
00:42:08,411 --> 00:42:10,954
The first time you made love to me.

453
00:42:14,834 --> 00:42:16,001
April.

454
00:42:54,749 --> 00:42:55,916
Frank.

455
00:43:22,902 --> 00:43:25,403
- What's up?
- Bart Pollock's here.

456
00:43:25,613 --> 00:43:27,572
He's in Bandy's office.

457
00:43:29,575 --> 00:43:31,076
Big deal, huh?

458
00:43:36,457 --> 00:43:38,959
Looks like he wants to talk to you.

459
00:43:41,587 --> 00:43:44,506
Hey, keep my name out of it.

460
00:43:51,013 --> 00:43:54,724
Frank. Good to see you.
You know Bart Pollock?

461
00:43:54,809 --> 00:43:58,937
- Well, we've never met, but of course...
- Good to know you, Frank.

462
00:43:59,021 --> 00:44:01,690
"Speaking of Production Control"?

463
00:44:04,777 --> 00:44:09,656
Frank, this is a crackerfack.

464
00:44:11,492 --> 00:44:14,619
They are tickled to death in Toledo.

465
00:44:22,295 --> 00:44:23,295
Really?

466
00:44:25,214 --> 00:44:29,551
So, this guy Pollock was perfect
presidential material in the worst sense.

467
00:44:29,635 --> 00:44:34,014
A million dollar smile and about three
pounds of muscle between the ears.

468
00:44:34,098 --> 00:44:36,224
April, you should have heard this guy.

469
00:44:36,309 --> 00:44:40,896
"Frank, this is a crackerfack."
What a horse's ass.

470
00:44:41,147 --> 00:44:44,733
Wish I'd seen his face
when you told him you were leaving.

471
00:44:45,735 --> 00:44:46,860
Yeah.

472
00:44:53,743 --> 00:44:55,243
Here they come.

473
00:44:58,372 --> 00:45:00,624
- Sorry to be late.
- You're not late.

474
00:45:00,708 --> 00:45:03,335
- The traffic was terrible.
- Thank you. You didn't have to do that.

475
00:45:03,419 --> 00:45:05,712
- Good to see you.
- Wasn't it terrible, Howard?

476
00:45:05,796 --> 00:45:06,922
Well, Route 12.

477
00:45:07,006 --> 00:45:08,840
By the time they finish
that stretch of road,

478
00:45:08,925 --> 00:45:11,885
they'll have to start all over again, right?

479
00:45:12,678 --> 00:45:16,389
- And you must be John?
- Say hello, John.

480
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:20,018
Nice to meet you. Heard a lot about you.

481
00:45:21,854 --> 00:45:24,773
- Where are your darling children?
- They're at a birthday party?

482
00:45:24,857 --> 00:45:27,108
- Sorry they couldn't be here.
- Don't worry.

483
00:45:27,193 --> 00:45:29,527
If I had a certified lunatic
coming around my house,

484
00:45:29,612 --> 00:45:32,113
I'd probably get the kids
out of the way, too.

485
00:45:32,198 --> 00:45:36,534
Look at all this food. You didn't
have to go to any trouble for us.

486
00:45:36,619 --> 00:45:38,119
It's just some sandwiches.

487
00:45:38,204 --> 00:45:40,622
John, would you like a sandwich?

488
00:45:41,123 --> 00:45:44,501
Helen's been talking it up
about you people for months.

489
00:45:44,585 --> 00:45:47,337
The nice young Wheelers
on Revolutionary Road,

490
00:45:47,421 --> 00:45:51,049
the nice young Revolutionaries
on Wheeler Road.

491
00:45:52,176 --> 00:45:55,762
- Would anyone like some sherry?
- Please don't bother, Frank.

492
00:45:55,846 --> 00:45:57,138
I'd like some sherry.

493
00:45:57,223 --> 00:46:00,850
And I'll drink Helen's, too,
if she doesn't beat me to it.

494
00:46:02,353 --> 00:46:05,271
But, hey, you got a highball glass?

495
00:46:05,398 --> 00:46:09,401
Put a couple-three ice cubes in it,
pour it up to the brim.

496
00:46:09,902 --> 00:46:13,446
- That's the way I like it.
- I think I can handle that.

497
00:46:19,036 --> 00:46:22,872
This egg salad is delicious, April.
You must tell me how you fix it.

498
00:46:22,957 --> 00:46:26,001
- You a lawyer, Frank?
- No. No, I'm not.

499
00:46:26,085 --> 00:46:27,419
I could use a lawyer.

500
00:46:27,545 --> 00:46:30,213
John, let's not get started again
about the lawyer.

501
00:46:30,297 --> 00:46:31,339
Pop, couldn't you just sit there

502
00:46:31,424 --> 00:46:34,801
and eat your wonderful egg salad
and quit horning in?

503
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:38,263
See, I've got a good
many questions to ask

504
00:46:38,389 --> 00:46:40,473
and I'm willing to pay for the answers.

505
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:43,810
Now, I don't need to be told that a man
who goes after his mother

506
00:46:43,936 --> 00:46:48,773
with a coffee table is putting himself in
a weak position legally, that's obvious.

507
00:46:48,899 --> 00:46:51,526
John, come and have a look
out this fabulous picture window.

508
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:54,029
If he hits her with it and kills her,
that's a criminal case.

509
00:46:54,113 --> 00:46:57,323
- Oh, look, the sun's coming out!
- Lf all he does is break the coffee table

510
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:59,284
and give her
a certain amount of aggravation

511
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:02,370
and she decides to
go to court over it, that's a civil case.

512
00:47:02,455 --> 00:47:05,040
Maybe we'll have a rainbow.
John, come have a look.

513
00:47:05,124 --> 00:47:08,209
Ma, how about doing everybody
a favour? How about shutting up!

514
00:47:08,627 --> 00:47:10,420
Settle down, now.

515
00:47:11,297 --> 00:47:15,258
Maybe I can look into it, recommend
someone. What do you say?

516
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:25,977
So, what do you do, Frank?

517
00:47:27,146 --> 00:47:30,273
I work at Knox Business Machines,
actually.

518
00:47:30,357 --> 00:47:32,067
You design the machines?

519
00:47:32,151 --> 00:47:35,320
- Nope.
- Make them, sell them, repair them?

520
00:47:35,404 --> 00:47:38,364
- All these questions.
- I help sell them, I guess.

521
00:47:38,908 --> 00:47:43,369
I work in the office. Actually, it's...

522
00:47:43,454 --> 00:47:44,996
Well, it's sort of a stupid job, really.

523
00:47:45,081 --> 00:47:47,999
There's nothing interesting
about it at all.

524
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:51,628
What do you do it for then?

525
00:47:51,712 --> 00:47:53,546
Maybe Frank doesn't like
being questioned like this.

526
00:47:53,631 --> 00:47:56,716
Okay, okay, okay.
I know it's none of my business.

527
00:47:56,801 --> 00:47:59,177
And besides, I know the answer.

528
00:48:00,012 --> 00:48:02,430
You want to play house,
you got to have a job.

529
00:48:02,515 --> 00:48:06,017
You want to play very nice house,
very sweet house,

530
00:48:06,102 --> 00:48:08,478
then you've got to have
a job you don't like.

531
00:48:08,562 --> 00:48:10,939
Anyone comes along and says,
"What do you do it for?"

532
00:48:11,023 --> 00:48:16,027
He's probably on a four-hour pass
from the state funny farm.

533
00:48:17,363 --> 00:48:20,907
- All agreed? Ma?
- Sorry, Frank.

534
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:26,371
Don't be. Don't be. Actually, John,
I agree with everything you just said.

535
00:48:26,539 --> 00:48:31,126
We both do. That's why I'm quitting
the job in the fall. We're taking off.

536
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:33,044
We're moving to Paris.

537
00:48:36,382 --> 00:48:38,883
Did you know about this, Ma?

538
00:48:40,553 --> 00:48:45,223
How do you feel about that, Ma?
The nice young Wheelers...

539
00:48:48,727 --> 00:48:53,898
The nice young Wheelers are taking off.

540
00:48:59,905 --> 00:49:03,366
- John, please.
- Steady down, Son.

541
00:49:08,372 --> 00:49:12,750
John. John. How about some fresh air?
What do you say?

542
00:49:12,835 --> 00:49:14,627
If that's all right with you?

543
00:49:14,712 --> 00:49:18,298
- I don't know if it's such a good idea...
- lf John wants to, I don't see the harm.

544
00:49:18,424 --> 00:49:20,800
- Good.
- After you.

545
00:49:25,097 --> 00:49:30,977
- I hear you're a mathematician.
- You hear wrong. It's all gone now.

546
00:49:31,896 --> 00:49:33,021
All gone?

547
00:49:33,105 --> 00:49:36,024
You know what
electrical shock treatments are?

548
00:49:36,108 --> 00:49:37,817
Yes. Yes, I do.

549
00:49:37,943 --> 00:49:39,569
I've had 37.

550
00:49:43,282 --> 00:49:46,159
Supposed to jolt out
the emotional problems.

551
00:49:46,285 --> 00:49:50,747
- Just jolted out the mathematics.
- How awful.

552
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:56,502
"How awful"? Why,
because mathematics is so interesting?

553
00:49:57,296 --> 00:50:00,298
No. Because the shocks
must be awful and,

554
00:50:00,633 --> 00:50:04,719
well, because it's awful not to be able
to do what it is that you want to do.

555
00:50:04,803 --> 00:50:07,347
I think mathematics must be dull.

556
00:50:08,933 --> 00:50:11,017
I like your girl, Frank.

557
00:50:11,185 --> 00:50:12,435
Me, too.

558
00:50:12,853 --> 00:50:16,105
So, what do a couple of people like you
have to run away from?

559
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:18,608
- We're not running.
- So what's in Paris?

560
00:50:18,692 --> 00:50:21,819
- A different way of life.
- Maybe we are running.

561
00:50:22,571 --> 00:50:26,741
We're running from the hopeless
emptiness of the whole life here, right?

562
00:50:26,825 --> 00:50:28,743
The hopeless emptiness?

563
00:50:32,873 --> 00:50:37,293
Now you've said it. Plenty of people
are on to the emptiness,

564
00:50:39,338 --> 00:50:42,382
but it takes real guts
to see the hopelessness.

565
00:50:47,805 --> 00:50:48,805
Wow.

566
00:51:03,445 --> 00:51:06,030
You know, he's the first person

567
00:51:06,156 --> 00:51:09,033
who seemed to know
what we were talking about.

568
00:51:09,118 --> 00:51:15,039
Yeah. That's true, isn't it?
Maybe we are just as crazy as he is.

569
00:51:17,042 --> 00:51:20,628
If being crazy means
living life as if it matters,

570
00:51:20,713 --> 00:51:23,715
then I don't care
if we are completely insane.

571
00:51:26,385 --> 00:51:27,635
Do you?

572
00:51:30,597 --> 00:51:31,597
No.

573
00:51:34,018 --> 00:51:35,768
I love you so much.

574
00:51:47,072 --> 00:51:50,408
Tell you something, Frank.
That Ted Bandy, nice guy.

575
00:51:50,617 --> 00:51:51,993
Real sport.

576
00:51:52,077 --> 00:51:53,828
Good enough department head and all.

577
00:51:53,912 --> 00:51:55,997
But I'm a little sore at him
for the way he's kept you

578
00:51:56,081 --> 00:51:58,166
under a bushel all these years.

579
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:01,836
- This place okay for you?
- It's just fine, sir. Just fine.

580
00:52:02,629 --> 00:52:05,256
One thing interests me, Frank,
and one thing only.

581
00:52:05,341 --> 00:52:09,093
Selling the electronic computer
to the American businessman.

582
00:52:09,595 --> 00:52:13,765
That's why I'm assembling a team.
Men like you.

583
00:52:14,391 --> 00:52:16,142
Not your average salesmen.

584
00:52:16,226 --> 00:52:17,518
It'll mean more money,

585
00:52:17,603 --> 00:52:21,230
and, I got to be honest,
maybe more of a time commitment.

586
00:52:21,357 --> 00:52:24,776
But you'll be a part of
something exciting, Wheeler.

587
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,194
Computers.

588
00:52:29,406 --> 00:52:32,617
Well, sir, it sounds exciting.

589
00:52:32,701 --> 00:52:34,452
- Bart.
- Bart.

590
00:52:39,541 --> 00:52:41,959
Bart, let me ask you a question.

591
00:52:42,628 --> 00:52:46,297
Do you happen to remember
an Earl Wheeler? Out of Yonkers?

592
00:52:47,633 --> 00:52:51,969
- Can't say that I do. Relation of yours?
- My father.

593
00:52:52,054 --> 00:52:55,473
He worked as a salesman for Knox
for almost 20 years.

594
00:52:57,101 --> 00:53:01,562
Earl Wheeler.

595
00:53:03,941 --> 00:53:06,526
There's no reason you'd remember him.

596
00:53:07,986 --> 00:53:10,446
Well, I'm sure he was a good man.

597
00:53:17,246 --> 00:53:22,625
Listen, Bart, there's something
I should have mentioned earlier.

598
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:27,630
I'm going to be leaving the firm
in the fall.

599
00:53:29,425 --> 00:53:32,593
- Another outfit?
- No, no, it's not another outfit.

600
00:53:32,678 --> 00:53:35,513
Now, look, Frank.
Is it a question of money?

601
00:53:36,181 --> 00:53:37,598
Because if it is, there's no reason

602
00:53:37,683 --> 00:53:38,766
we can't get together on a satisfactory...

603
00:53:38,851 --> 00:53:42,103
Well, I sure appreciate that,
but no, it's not the money.

604
00:53:42,187 --> 00:53:47,191
It's... Well, it's more of a personal thing.

605
00:53:47,693 --> 00:53:49,527
I hope you understand.

606
00:53:49,862 --> 00:53:51,529
A personal thing?

607
00:53:52,406 --> 00:53:53,614
I see.

608
00:53:54,867 --> 00:53:58,161
Frank, let me tell you something
my father told me.

609
00:53:58,454 --> 00:54:01,456
A man only gets
a couple of chances in life.

610
00:54:01,707 --> 00:54:03,791
If he doesn't grab them by the balls,

611
00:54:03,876 --> 00:54:05,668
it won't be long before
he's sitting around wondering

612
00:54:05,752 --> 00:54:08,087
how he got to be second rate.

613
00:54:14,052 --> 00:54:15,553
I guess so.

614
00:54:16,638 --> 00:54:19,390
So, do me a favour. Sleep on it.

615
00:54:21,185 --> 00:54:23,227
Discuss it with your wife.

616
00:54:24,521 --> 00:54:26,147
Because let's be honest,
where the hell would any of us be

617
00:54:26,231 --> 00:54:28,274
without our wives, anyway?

618
00:54:31,737 --> 00:54:35,490
And, Frank, in all sincerity,
if you do decide to join us,

619
00:54:35,574 --> 00:54:38,743
I believe it'll be a thing
you'll never regret.

620
00:54:39,745 --> 00:54:42,371
And I believe something else, too.

621
00:54:42,706 --> 00:54:45,833
I believe it'd be a fine memorial
to your dad.

622
00:54:48,253 --> 00:54:51,339
Think about it, Frank.
Really think about it.

623
00:54:58,222 --> 00:55:00,598
Knowing what you've got, comma,

624
00:55:02,684 --> 00:55:05,436
knowing what you need, comma,

625
00:55:07,105 --> 00:55:11,025
knowing what you can do without, dash.

626
00:55:12,903 --> 00:55:14,946
That's inventory control.

627
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:35,633
Knowing what you've got, comma,

628
00:55:37,469 --> 00:55:40,096
knowing what you need, comma,

629
00:55:42,015 --> 00:55:45,810
knowing what you can do without, dash.

630
00:55:47,688 --> 00:55:49,647
That's inventory control.

631
00:55:51,608 --> 00:55:52,984
Hi, Frank.

632
00:55:54,861 --> 00:55:56,320
Working late?

633
00:55:57,155 --> 00:56:00,658
Yeah. I got to dig myself out here.

634
00:56:02,869 --> 00:56:05,413
I heard you were getting promoted.

635
00:56:06,748 --> 00:56:08,124
Big shot.

636
00:56:11,795 --> 00:56:14,964
I guess your dad would have been
real proud, huh?

637
00:56:23,015 --> 00:56:24,890
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

638
00:56:34,401 --> 00:56:37,778
So maybe I should take you
for a drink or something?

639
00:56:39,072 --> 00:56:41,866
You know, celebrate.

640
00:56:46,538 --> 00:56:47,997
Yeah, maybe.

641
00:56:52,544 --> 00:56:54,545
I'll just get my things.

642
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:04,138
I'm going to bring my doll carriage

643
00:57:04,222 --> 00:57:07,141
and my three Easter rabbits
and my giraffe

644
00:57:07,225 --> 00:57:10,311
and all my dolls and my doll house
and my crayons...

645
00:57:10,395 --> 00:57:12,146
I thought maybe
we'd give the doll house to Madeline.

646
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:14,273
I don't want to give the doll house
to Madeline.

647
00:57:14,358 --> 00:57:15,566
But I already explained to you,

648
00:57:15,651 --> 00:57:17,276
the big things
are going to be hard to pack.

649
00:57:17,361 --> 00:57:18,778
But she can have my bear,

650
00:57:18,862 --> 00:57:22,323
- and my three Easter rabbits.
- No! Just the big things.

651
00:57:22,407 --> 00:57:24,492
Look. Wouldn't you rather go outside
and play with Michael?

652
00:57:24,576 --> 00:57:27,078
- I don't feel like it.
- You've been inside all day.

653
00:57:27,162 --> 00:57:28,371
I don't feel like it.

654
00:57:28,455 --> 00:57:31,624
Well, I don't feel like
explaining everything 15 times

655
00:57:31,708 --> 00:57:34,835
to somebody who's too bored and silly
to listen!

656
00:57:41,677 --> 00:57:44,428
- All right, April. What's the matter?
- Nothing.

657
00:57:44,513 --> 00:57:47,264
I don't believe you.
Did something happen this morning?

658
00:57:47,349 --> 00:57:50,768
Nothing happened today that I haven't
known about for days and days.

659
00:57:50,852 --> 00:57:51,936
What?

660
00:57:52,604 --> 00:57:55,523
Oh, God, Frank,
please don't look so dense.

661
00:57:55,607 --> 00:57:57,358
You mean you haven't guessed
or anything?

662
00:57:57,442 --> 00:57:59,860
April, what are you talking about?

663
00:58:03,031 --> 00:58:05,116
I'm pregnant, that's all.

664
00:58:07,911 --> 00:58:08,953
What?

665
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:11,372
Frank, I meant to wait
till the kids were in bed to tell you,

666
00:58:11,456 --> 00:58:14,375
but I just...
Well, I've been pretty sure all week

667
00:58:14,459 --> 00:58:15,793
and today I went to the doctor,

668
00:58:15,877 --> 00:58:18,713
and now I can't even pretend
it's not true.

669
00:58:20,173 --> 00:58:22,216
- How long?
- Ten weeks.

670
00:58:24,636 --> 00:58:29,056
Ten weeks. Ten weeks?
And you wait until now to tell me?

671
00:58:29,141 --> 00:58:34,979
No, well, I thought... I don't know what
I thought. I'm sorry, Frank. I'm so sorry.

672
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:37,898
I know. I know you are. All right?

673
00:58:39,025 --> 00:58:41,152
But there are things we can do.

674
00:58:41,236 --> 00:58:44,238
We don't have to let this stop us
from going, do we?

675
00:58:44,322 --> 00:58:46,574
Remember that girl at school
I told you about?

676
00:58:46,658 --> 00:58:50,327
As long as we take care of it
before 12 weeks, it's fine.

677
00:58:51,496 --> 00:58:54,248
We've got to be together in this, Frank.

678
00:58:56,543 --> 00:59:01,255
Well, we'll figure it out. All right?

679
00:59:03,675 --> 00:59:05,009
Come here.

680
00:59:07,846 --> 00:59:11,348
Twelve weeks.
So we have time to decide, right?

681
00:59:11,808 --> 00:59:13,017
Right.

682
00:59:15,353 --> 00:59:16,771
I love you.

683
00:59:20,942 --> 00:59:22,610
I love you, too.

684
01:00:06,822 --> 01:00:10,866
So, Frank, how's work?
They gonna survive without you?

685
01:00:13,036 --> 01:00:16,163
Actually, something kind of funny
happened the other day.

686
01:00:17,332 --> 01:00:20,835
I did some dumb little piece of work
to get myself off the hook with Bandy,

687
01:00:20,919 --> 01:00:23,754
and suddenly,
I'm the bright young man.

688
01:00:24,923 --> 01:00:27,508
- That's always the way, ain't it?
- It's incredible.

689
01:00:27,592 --> 01:00:29,593
I mean, I knocked this thing off
in a couple of minutes

690
01:00:29,678 --> 01:00:33,597
and now they want me to join
their team of "specialist" salesmen.

691
01:00:33,932 --> 01:00:35,266
Morons.

692
01:00:37,352 --> 01:00:39,228
Well, it would be funny
if they weren't offering

693
01:00:39,312 --> 01:00:41,105
so much damn money.

694
01:00:45,735 --> 01:00:47,528
So, are you tempted?

695
01:00:48,113 --> 01:00:51,282
Well, it's just kind of ironic,
don't you think?

696
01:01:14,973 --> 01:01:17,474
I thought you turned the job down.

697
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:20,019
Not yet.

698
01:01:21,187 --> 01:01:23,522
It's just an option, that's all.

699
01:01:24,566 --> 01:01:27,610
With the kind of money they're talking,
things could be different for us here.

700
01:01:27,694 --> 01:01:30,362
We could get a better place. Travel.

701
01:01:31,281 --> 01:01:34,575
The point is, we could be happy here,
at least for a little while.

702
01:01:34,659 --> 01:01:36,911
It is possible that Parisians
aren't the only ones

703
01:01:36,995 --> 01:01:39,914
capable of leading
interesting lives, April.

704
01:01:39,998 --> 01:01:41,957
So you've made up your mind?

705
01:01:42,042 --> 01:01:46,086
No. No. Like I said, it's just an option.
That's all.

706
01:01:49,925 --> 01:01:52,092
And supposing you're right.

707
01:01:52,302 --> 01:01:56,263
You make all this money
and we have this interesting life here.

708
01:01:56,723 --> 01:02:01,518
Won't you still be wasting your life
toiling away at a job you find ridiculous?

709
01:02:02,437 --> 01:02:04,647
Maybe we let that be my business,
all right?

710
01:02:04,731 --> 01:02:06,148
Your business?

711
01:02:06,232 --> 01:02:10,152
You know what? It's too hot for this.
I'm going to go get wet.

712
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:25,626
- You don't want to go, do you?
- Come on, April. Of course, I do.

713
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:28,671
No, you don't.
Because you've never tried at anything.

714
01:02:28,755 --> 01:02:31,548
And if you don't try at anything,
you can't fail.

715
01:02:31,633 --> 01:02:33,968
What the hell do you mean I don't try?

716
01:02:34,052 --> 01:02:36,512
I support you, don't I?
I pay for this house.

717
01:02:36,596 --> 01:02:39,139
I work 10 hours a day
at a job I can't stand.

718
01:02:39,224 --> 01:02:41,475
- You don't have to.
- Bullshit!

719
01:02:41,726 --> 01:02:42,935
Look, I'm not happy about it.

720
01:02:43,019 --> 01:02:45,980
But I have the backbone not to run away
from my responsibilities.

721
01:02:46,064 --> 01:02:49,316
It takes backbone
to lead the life you want, Frank.

722
01:02:53,947 --> 01:02:54,989
Where are you going?

723
01:02:55,073 --> 01:02:59,410
If it's all right with you, April,
I'm gonna go use the bathroom. Okay?

724
01:03:27,605 --> 01:03:30,524
What the hell are you going to do
with this?

725
01:03:30,608 --> 01:03:32,109
And what do you think
you're going to do?

726
01:03:32,193 --> 01:03:33,861
- You're going to stop me?
- You're damn right I am!

727
01:03:33,945 --> 01:03:35,112
Go ahead and try.

728
01:03:35,196 --> 01:03:38,907
Listen to me. You do this, April,
you do this and I swear to God I'll...

729
01:03:38,992 --> 01:03:41,326
You'll what? You'll leave me?
Is that a threat or a promise?

730
01:03:41,411 --> 01:03:42,536
When did you buy this, April?

731
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:44,204
How long have you had this?
I want to know!

732
01:03:44,289 --> 01:03:45,247
Jesus Christ.

733
01:03:45,331 --> 01:03:48,333
You really are being melodramatic
about this whole thing.

734
01:03:48,418 --> 01:03:52,046
As long as it's done
in the first 12 weeks, it's perfectly safe.

735
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:55,257
- That's now, April! Don't I get a say?
- Of course you do!

736
01:03:55,341 --> 01:03:57,593
It would be for you, Frank.
Don't you see?

737
01:03:57,677 --> 01:03:59,636
So you can have time,
just like we talked about.

738
01:03:59,721 --> 01:04:01,096
How can it be for me
when the thought of it

739
01:04:01,181 --> 01:04:03,182
makes my stomach turn over,
for God's sake?

740
01:04:03,266 --> 01:04:04,683
Then it's for me.

741
01:04:04,768 --> 01:04:06,643
Tell me we can have the baby
in Paris, Frank.

742
01:04:06,728 --> 01:04:10,939
Tell me we can have a different life.
But don't make me stay here. Please.

743
01:04:11,024 --> 01:04:14,318
- We can't have the baby in Paris.
- Why not?

744
01:04:14,402 --> 01:04:17,446
I don't need everything we have here.
I don't care where we live.

745
01:04:17,530 --> 01:04:20,157
I mean, who made these rules, anyway?

746
01:04:21,159 --> 01:04:26,205
Look, the only reason we moved
out here was because I got pregnant.

747
01:04:26,289 --> 01:04:28,832
Then we had another child to prove
the first one wasn't a mistake.

748
01:04:28,917 --> 01:04:31,251
I mean, how long does it go on?

749
01:04:32,545 --> 01:04:36,173
Frank.
Do you actually want another child?

750
01:04:38,134 --> 01:04:41,637
Well, do you? Come on, tell me.

751
01:04:42,597 --> 01:04:45,557
Tell me the truth, Frank.
Remember that?

752
01:04:46,226 --> 01:04:47,976
We used to live by it.

753
01:04:48,061 --> 01:04:50,479
And you know what's so good
about the truth?

754
01:04:50,563 --> 01:04:54,483
Everyone knows what it is,
however long they've lived without it.

755
01:04:54,567 --> 01:04:58,695
No one forgets the truth, Frank.
They just get better at lying.

756
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:05,410
So tell me,
do you really want another child?

757
01:05:07,288 --> 01:05:09,414
All I know is what I feel.

758
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:16,255
And anyone else in their right mind
would feel the same way, April.

759
01:05:16,339 --> 01:05:20,634
But I've had two children.
Doesn't that count in my favour?

760
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:23,679
Christ, April!
The fact that you even put it that way!

761
01:05:23,763 --> 01:05:27,766
You make it seem as if having children
is some sort of a goddamn punishment.

762
01:05:27,892 --> 01:05:29,935
I love my children, Frank.

763
01:05:31,938 --> 01:05:34,273
And you're sure about that, huh?

764
01:05:34,774 --> 01:05:36,984
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

765
01:05:37,068 --> 01:05:40,737
April, you just said our daughter
was a mistake.

766
01:05:41,239 --> 01:05:43,157
How do I know you didn't try
to get rid of her,

767
01:05:43,241 --> 01:05:44,867
- or Michael for that matter?
- No.

768
01:05:44,951 --> 01:05:47,828
How do I know you didn't try to flush
our entire fucking family

769
01:05:47,912 --> 01:05:50,914
- down the toilet?
- No, that's not true. Of course I didn't.

770
01:05:50,999 --> 01:05:53,000
But how do I know, April?

771
01:05:53,126 --> 01:05:56,211
Stop. Please just stop, Frank.

772
01:05:56,713 --> 01:06:01,091
April, a normal woman,
a normal sane mother

773
01:06:01,176 --> 01:06:04,511
doesn't buy a piece of rubber tubing
to give herself an abortion

774
01:06:04,596 --> 01:06:07,890
so she can live out
some kind of a goddamn fantasy.

775
01:06:18,443 --> 01:06:23,572
Look, all I'm saying is you don't seem
entirely rational about this thing.

776
01:06:25,241 --> 01:06:27,201
And I think it's about time
we found somebody

777
01:06:27,285 --> 01:06:29,620
to help make some sense of your life.

778
01:06:30,872 --> 01:06:33,874
And the newjob's going to
pay for that, too?

779
01:06:36,127 --> 01:06:40,881
April, if you need a shrink,
it will be paid for.

780
01:06:41,966 --> 01:06:43,342
Obviously.

781
01:06:47,513 --> 01:06:51,850
Okay. I guess there isn't much more
to say then, is there?

782
01:07:01,361 --> 01:07:04,529
So I guess Paris
was a pretty childish idea, huh?

783
01:07:10,578 --> 01:07:12,412
I guess maybe it was.

784
01:07:25,677 --> 01:07:29,763
April, we can be happy here.

785
01:07:31,057 --> 01:07:33,100
I can make you happy here.

786
01:07:33,851 --> 01:07:37,604
We've had a great couple of months.
It doesn't need to end.

787
01:07:40,191 --> 01:07:44,236
We're going to be okay. I promise.

788
01:07:48,491 --> 01:07:50,158
I hope so, Frank.

789
01:07:51,953 --> 01:07:53,620
I really hope so.

790
01:08:34,287 --> 01:08:37,539
Thank you for waiting.
Mr Pollock will see you now.

791
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,084
Thanks so much.

792
01:08:51,846 --> 01:08:54,222
Foiled by faulty contraception.

793
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:57,601
I can't say that I'm sorry.

794
01:08:57,685 --> 01:09:01,396
You'd have been sorely missed
in the old cubicle, I can tell you that.

795
01:09:01,481 --> 01:09:04,232
Wouldn't have been the same
without you.

796
01:09:04,317 --> 01:09:07,444
Besides... Well...

797
01:09:10,114 --> 01:09:11,156
What?

798
01:09:12,533 --> 01:09:17,621
The plan always seemed
a touch unrealistic, don't you think?

799
01:09:22,335 --> 01:09:23,710
I suppose
it's none of my business, really.

800
01:09:23,795 --> 01:09:27,130
No. No. I suppose it isn't.

801
01:09:30,802 --> 01:09:31,968
Well...

802
01:09:34,931 --> 01:09:38,350
They'll be celebrating
in the secretarial pool.

803
01:10:07,630 --> 01:10:10,590
Hey! Do you remember the first time
you brought us here?

804
01:10:10,675 --> 01:10:11,842
Absolutely.

805
01:10:11,926 --> 01:10:16,096
You said it takes a special kind of taste
to enjoy Vito's Log Cabin.

806
01:10:16,222 --> 01:10:18,974
It's so awful, it's kind of nice.

807
01:10:22,603 --> 01:10:28,692
Look at me. I'm just so happy.
Our little gang's back together again.

808
01:10:32,905 --> 01:10:34,990
How do you like the boys in the band?
Aren't they swinging tonight?

809
01:10:41,789 --> 01:10:45,167
- Hey, Europe's not going anywhere.
- That's right.

810
01:11:07,982 --> 01:11:10,692
April, honey, how about a dance?

811
01:11:13,154 --> 01:11:15,739
Not right now. Maybe later.

812
01:11:15,823 --> 01:11:18,408
- I'll dance.
- Okay.

813
01:11:33,257 --> 01:11:36,384
Guess she's still pretty blue
about Paris, huh?

814
01:11:37,094 --> 01:11:38,345
Think she'll be okay?

815
01:11:38,429 --> 01:11:42,224
Sure. Give us girls a couple of days
and we can get over anything.

816
01:11:42,308 --> 01:11:43,517
Right.

817
01:11:45,269 --> 01:11:56,196
Frank.

818
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:59,115
Are you okay? Are you okay? Milly?

819
01:11:59,825 --> 01:12:01,284
I'm so sorry.

820
01:12:02,370 --> 01:12:03,745
Excuse me.

821
01:12:08,668 --> 01:12:10,335
That's just great.

822
01:12:11,087 --> 01:12:14,047
How the hell
are we supposed to get out now?

823
01:12:14,423 --> 01:12:15,674
Oh, boy.

824
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:20,095
Don't worry about it, Shep.
We can wait. Really.

825
01:12:20,263 --> 01:12:21,763
What about the sitter?

826
01:12:21,847 --> 01:12:24,933
Listen, why don't you drive Milly home,
then go home yourself.

827
01:12:25,017 --> 01:12:27,978
That takes care of both sitters.
Then Shep can take me home later.

828
01:12:28,062 --> 01:12:30,730
- Yeah, it's fine by me.
- Okay, then.

829
01:12:32,066 --> 01:12:35,652
- You... You'll be all right?
- Sure.

830
01:12:36,445 --> 01:12:37,571
Okay.

831
01:12:39,115 --> 01:12:41,032
- Good night.
- Good night.

832
01:12:41,659 --> 01:12:43,034
Feel better.

833
01:13:03,014 --> 01:13:05,765
I'm sorry you're not
going away any more.

834
01:13:06,892 --> 01:13:09,269
I know it was important to you.

835
01:13:10,521 --> 01:13:14,983
Don't take this wrong,
but I've been there.

836
01:13:15,818 --> 01:13:18,695
They don't have so much
we don't have here.

837
01:13:19,322 --> 01:13:21,448
It didn't have to be Paris.

838
01:13:22,867 --> 01:13:26,536
You just wanted out, huh?

839
01:13:27,079 --> 01:13:28,538
I wanted in.

840
01:13:31,959 --> 01:13:35,629
I just wanted us to live again.

841
01:13:41,344 --> 01:13:44,304
For years,
I thought we shared this secret.

842
01:13:47,391 --> 01:13:50,185
That we would be
wonderful in the world.

843
01:13:53,814 --> 01:13:56,399
I didn't exactly know how, but just...

844
01:13:57,985 --> 01:14:00,528
Just the possibility kept me hoping.

845
01:14:07,703 --> 01:14:09,579
How pathetic is that?

846
01:14:11,499 --> 01:14:12,957
So stupid.

847
01:14:15,336 --> 01:14:20,465
To put all your hopes in a promise
that was never made?

848
01:14:24,470 --> 01:14:27,430
See, Frank knows.
He knows what he wants.

849
01:14:27,723 --> 01:14:30,350
He's found his place. He's just fine.

850
01:14:31,769 --> 01:14:33,478
Married, two kids.

851
01:14:38,609 --> 01:14:40,402
It should be enough.

852
01:14:45,741 --> 01:14:47,242
It is for him.

853
01:14:51,956 --> 01:14:53,456
And he's right.

854
01:14:56,085 --> 01:14:59,713
We were never special or destined
or anything at all.

855
01:15:00,256 --> 01:15:01,965
Yes, you are.

856
01:15:03,467 --> 01:15:04,801
You're...

857
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:08,263
You're the Wheelers.

858
01:15:08,389 --> 01:15:11,349
You're a terrific couple.
Everybody says so.

859
01:15:12,685 --> 01:15:14,936
I saw a whole other future.

860
01:15:18,482 --> 01:15:20,400
I can't stop seeing it.

861
01:15:25,656 --> 01:15:27,031
Can't leave,

862
01:15:29,285 --> 01:15:30,702
can't stay.

863
01:15:33,038 --> 01:15:34,914
No damn use to anyone.

864
01:15:43,007 --> 01:15:44,257
Come on.

865
01:15:45,843 --> 01:15:47,218
Let's do it.

866
01:16:56,956 --> 01:16:58,164
Let me take you somewhere.

867
01:16:58,249 --> 01:17:01,626
No. Just do it here. Now.

868
01:17:48,591 --> 01:17:49,757
April.

869
01:17:52,469 --> 01:17:54,804
This is what I've always wanted.

870
01:17:56,223 --> 01:17:57,599
I love you.

871
01:17:58,601 --> 01:18:00,143
Don't say that.

872
01:18:01,770 --> 01:18:05,356
No. I mean it, I love you.

873
01:18:05,482 --> 01:18:09,319
Please, just be quiet for a minute.

874
01:18:13,782 --> 01:18:15,909
Then you can take me home.

875
01:19:06,877 --> 01:19:08,586
It's beautiful out.

876
01:19:09,838 --> 01:19:11,255
Yes, it is.

877
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:18,137
You know what today is?

878
01:19:18,681 --> 01:19:21,182
- It's 12 weeks.
- That's right.

879
01:19:25,145 --> 01:19:28,690
Look, this has been
kind of a crazy summer.

880
01:19:28,774 --> 01:19:30,817
We've both been under a strain.

881
01:19:30,901 --> 01:19:33,653
I mean, I understand why you're upset.

882
01:19:34,363 --> 01:19:38,157
You know I'm not sleeping with you,
and you want to know why.

883
01:19:39,576 --> 01:19:44,414
Well, I'm sorry, Frank,
but I really don't feel like talking about it.

884
01:19:45,082 --> 01:19:48,084
All right.
Then what should we talk about, April?

885
01:19:48,168 --> 01:19:51,587
Would it be all right
if we didn't talk about anything?

886
01:19:51,672 --> 01:19:55,299
I mean, can't we just take each day
as it comes, and do the best we can,

887
01:19:55,384 --> 01:19:59,012
and not feel like we have to talk
about everything all the time?

888
01:19:59,096 --> 01:20:02,473
I don't think I'm suggesting that
we talk about everything all the time.

889
01:20:02,558 --> 01:20:06,769
Look, my point is we've both been
under a strain

890
01:20:06,854 --> 01:20:11,107
and we ought to be helping each other
out as much as we can right now.

891
01:20:11,191 --> 01:20:15,153
I mean, God knows my own behaviour
has been pretty weird lately.

892
01:20:17,781 --> 01:20:21,868
As a matter of fact, there is something
I'd like to tell you about.

893
01:20:23,704 --> 01:20:27,165
I've been with a girl a few times,
in the city.

894
01:20:28,959 --> 01:20:31,252
A girl I hardly even know.

895
01:20:31,754 --> 01:20:34,380
It was nothing to me,

896
01:20:34,465 --> 01:20:38,468
but it's over now, really over.

897
01:20:39,303 --> 01:20:43,097
And if I weren't sure of that, I guess
I could never have told you about it.

898
01:20:48,437 --> 01:20:49,896
Why did you?

899
01:20:50,647 --> 01:20:52,482
Baby, I don't know.

900
01:20:53,025 --> 01:20:55,568
I think it's a simple case
of wanting to be a man again

901
01:20:55,652 --> 01:20:57,361
after all that abortion business.

902
01:20:57,446 --> 01:21:01,157
Some kind of neurotic,
irrational need to prove something.

903
01:21:01,241 --> 01:21:04,535
No. I don't mean
why did you have the girl.

904
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:07,413
I mean, why did you tell me about it?

905
01:21:09,875 --> 01:21:13,002
- What do you mean?
- I mean, what's the point?

906
01:21:15,172 --> 01:21:18,424
Is it supposed to make me jealous
or something?

907
01:21:18,509 --> 01:21:20,343
Is it supposed to make me
fall in love with you,

908
01:21:20,427 --> 01:21:23,221
or back into bed with you, or what?

909
01:21:23,305 --> 01:21:26,974
I mean,
what would you like me to say, Frank?

910
01:21:28,644 --> 01:21:31,354
Why don't you say what you feel, April?

911
01:21:32,439 --> 01:21:34,357
I don't feel anything.

912
01:21:35,025 --> 01:21:39,112
In other words, you don't care what I do
or who I fuck or anything?

913
01:21:42,783 --> 01:21:46,077
No, I guess that's right. I don't.

914
01:21:48,497 --> 01:21:50,206
Fuck who you like.

915
01:21:50,541 --> 01:21:53,751
April, don't you understand
that I want you to care?

916
01:21:53,836 --> 01:21:56,045
I know. I know you do.

917
01:21:57,214 --> 01:21:59,423
And I suppose I would if I loved you.

918
01:21:59,508 --> 01:22:02,635
But I don't think I do any more.
And I only just figured that out.

919
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:06,180
And that's why I'd just as soon
not do any talking right now.

920
01:22:06,265 --> 01:22:08,724
Don't give me that shit, April.
Don't give me that.

921
01:22:08,809 --> 01:22:11,435
- You know goddamn well you love me.
- You think so?

922
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,396
You know goddamn well!

923
01:22:15,399 --> 01:22:16,899
Anyone home?

924
01:22:21,405 --> 01:22:24,448
I'm sorry dinner's late.
Would anyone like another drink?

925
01:22:24,533 --> 01:22:28,286
Don't worry.
It's nice to just sit a bit and socialise.

926
01:22:28,579 --> 01:22:30,204
You shouldn't have gone to
all this trouble.

927
01:22:30,289 --> 01:22:31,998
With all your packing and whatnot.

928
01:22:32,082 --> 01:22:35,877
I imagine you have a lot on your plate.
No pun intended.

929
01:22:37,337 --> 01:22:39,589
Actually, there's been
a change of plans.

930
01:22:40,507 --> 01:22:42,842
I thought maybe it was obvious.

931
01:22:42,926 --> 01:22:44,218
April here is pregnant.

932
01:22:44,303 --> 01:22:47,430
- Congratulations.
- Oh, April!

933
01:22:47,514 --> 01:22:50,683
I can't tell you how pleased I am!

934
01:22:50,767 --> 01:22:53,394
But I expect you'll be needing
a bigger house now, won't you?

935
01:22:53,478 --> 01:22:56,314
Hold it a second, Ma.
Hold on a second, Ma.

936
01:22:56,398 --> 01:23:00,359
I don't get this.
I mean, what's so obvious about it?

937
01:23:00,444 --> 01:23:05,281
I mean, okay, she's pregnant, so what?
Don't people have babies in Europe?

938
01:23:05,365 --> 01:23:07,033
- John...
- Suppose we just say

939
01:23:07,117 --> 01:23:10,036
that people anywhere
aren't very well advised to have babies

940
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:12,246
unless they can afford them.

941
01:23:12,915 --> 01:23:17,585
Okay. Okay, it's a question of money.
Money's a good reason.

942
01:23:17,669 --> 01:23:22,048
But it's hardly ever the real reason.

943
01:23:22,132 --> 01:23:27,345
What's the real reason?
Wife talk you out of it or what?

944
01:23:27,888 --> 01:23:31,849
Little woman decide she isn't
quite ready to quit playing house?

945
01:23:32,935 --> 01:23:35,311
No, no, that's not it. I can tell.

946
01:23:35,395 --> 01:23:38,522
She looks too tough
and adequate as hell.

947
01:23:40,442 --> 01:23:45,112
Okay, then. It must've been you.
What happened?

948
01:23:45,197 --> 01:23:49,825
- John, please. You're being very rude.
- No, no. What happened, Frank?

949
01:23:55,207 --> 01:23:56,540
You get cold feet?

950
01:23:56,625 --> 01:23:59,877
You decide
you're better off here after all?

951
01:24:00,629 --> 01:24:04,799
You figure it's more comfy

952
01:24:04,883 --> 01:24:09,387
here in the old hopeless emptiness
after all, huh?

953
01:24:10,472 --> 01:24:14,308
Oh, wow, that did it. Look at his face.

954
01:24:14,393 --> 01:24:16,686
What's the matter, Wheeler?
Am I getting warm?

955
01:24:16,770 --> 01:24:20,189
- All right, Son. I think we'd better be...
- You know something?

956
01:24:20,274 --> 01:24:23,192
I wouldn't be surprised
if he knocked her up on purpose

957
01:24:23,277 --> 01:24:26,946
just so he could spend the rest of his
life hiding behind a maternity dress.

958
01:24:27,030 --> 01:24:30,283
That way he'd never have to find out
what he's really made of.

959
01:24:30,367 --> 01:24:34,036
Now look, I think that's just about
enough out of you.

960
01:24:34,621 --> 01:24:36,914
I mean, who the hell
do you think you are?

961
01:24:36,999 --> 01:24:38,416
You come in here and say

962
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:41,544
whatever crazy goddamn thing
comes into your head,

963
01:24:41,628 --> 01:24:44,922
and I think it's about time somebody told
you to keep your goddamn mouth shut.

964
01:24:45,007 --> 01:24:48,050
- He's not well, Frank.
- Not well, my ass!

965
01:24:48,260 --> 01:24:52,013
I don't give a damn
if he's sick or well or dead or alive,

966
01:24:52,097 --> 01:24:53,764
he should keep his fucking opinions

967
01:24:53,849 --> 01:24:57,393
in the fucking insane asylum
where they belong!

968
01:25:00,355 --> 01:25:02,773
- Let's go, Son.
- Come on, John.

969
01:25:07,195 --> 01:25:09,947
Big man you got there, April.

970
01:25:10,574 --> 01:25:12,533
Big family man.

971
01:25:16,246 --> 01:25:18,247
I feel sorry for you.

972
01:25:20,917 --> 01:25:24,378
Still, maybe you deserve each other.

973
01:25:24,463 --> 01:25:29,133
I mean, the way you look right now,
I'm beginning to feel sorry for him, too.

974
01:25:30,677 --> 01:25:33,054
You must give him a pretty bad time

975
01:25:33,138 --> 01:25:37,058
if making babies is the only way
he can prove he's got a pair of balls.

976
01:25:37,309 --> 01:25:41,896
- You fucking...
- No! He's not well, Frank!

977
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:57,203
All right, John.
Let's get on out to the car now.

978
01:26:03,001 --> 01:26:05,961
April, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

979
01:26:06,046 --> 01:26:10,674
Oh, right. Sorry. Sorry! Sorry!

980
01:26:10,759 --> 01:26:13,719
Ma, have I said
"I'm sorry" enough times?

981
01:26:13,804 --> 01:26:16,097
Damn! I am sorry, too.

982
01:26:16,181 --> 01:26:19,141
I bet I'm just about
the sorriest bastard I know.

983
01:26:19,226 --> 01:26:23,354
But get right down to it, I don't have
a whole hell of a lot to be glad about.

984
01:26:23,438 --> 01:26:24,563
Do I?

985
01:26:27,275 --> 01:26:29,235
But, hey, you know what?

986
01:26:30,570 --> 01:26:32,655
I am glad about one thing.

987
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:35,533
You want to know what I'm glad about?

988
01:26:37,953 --> 01:26:40,579
I'm glad I'm not gonna be that kid.

989
01:26:58,181 --> 01:27:01,642
Okay, okay, don't tell me.

990
01:27:02,227 --> 01:27:04,353
Don't tell me, let me guess.

991
01:27:04,938 --> 01:27:08,482
I made a disgusting spectacle
of myself, right?

992
01:27:10,235 --> 01:27:11,318
Right.

993
01:27:11,403 --> 01:27:13,028
And everything that man said
is true, right?

994
01:27:13,113 --> 01:27:14,905
Is that what you're going to say?

995
01:27:14,990 --> 01:27:17,116
Apparently I don't have to.

996
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:20,202
- You're saying it for me.
- Well, you're wrong, April.

997
01:27:20,287 --> 01:27:23,998
- Really? Why am I wrong?
- Because the man is insane.

998
01:27:24,082 --> 01:27:27,334
He's fucking insane! Do you know what
the definition of insanity is?

999
01:27:27,419 --> 01:27:28,586
No. Do you?

1000
01:27:28,670 --> 01:27:32,173
Yes, it's the inability
to relate to another human being.

1001
01:27:32,257 --> 01:27:34,341
It's the inability to love.

1002
01:27:39,347 --> 01:27:42,057
April. April.

1003
01:27:42,642 --> 01:27:45,394
April! April!

1004
01:27:45,479 --> 01:27:49,732
The inability... The inability to love.

1005
01:27:51,568 --> 01:27:54,528
Frank. You really are a wonderful talker.

1006
01:27:54,613 --> 01:27:57,948
If black could be made into white
by talking,

1007
01:27:58,033 --> 01:28:00,075
you'd be the man for the job.

1008
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:02,661
So now I'm crazy
because I don't love you. Right?

1009
01:28:02,746 --> 01:28:04,830
- Is that the point?
- No. Wrong.

1010
01:28:04,915 --> 01:28:08,876
You're not crazy and you do love me.
That's the point, April.

1011
01:28:09,336 --> 01:28:12,588
But I don't. I hate you.

1012
01:28:13,131 --> 01:28:15,925
You were just some boy
who made me laugh at a party? Once

1013
01:28:16,009 --> 01:28:18,511
and now I loathe the sight of you.

1014
01:28:19,054 --> 01:28:22,640
In fact, if you come any closer,
if you touch me or anything,

1015
01:28:22,724 --> 01:28:24,600
I think I'll scream.

1016
01:28:25,852 --> 01:28:27,895
Come on. Stop this, April.

1017
01:28:33,443 --> 01:28:35,402
Fuck you, April!

1018
01:28:35,487 --> 01:28:38,906
Fuck you and all your hateful,
stuck-up, little goddamn...

1019
01:28:38,990 --> 01:28:41,700
What're you going to do now?
Are you going to hit me?

1020
01:28:41,785 --> 01:28:44,828
- To show me how much you love me?
- Don't worry, I can't be bothered!

1021
01:28:44,996 --> 01:28:47,665
You're not worth the trouble
it would take to hit you.

1022
01:28:47,749 --> 01:28:50,459
You're not worth the powder
it would take to blow you up.

1023
01:28:50,544 --> 01:28:54,838
You're an empty, empty,
hollow shell of a woman!

1024
01:28:55,966 --> 01:28:59,969
What the hell are you doing in my house
if you hate me so much?

1025
01:29:00,512 --> 01:29:02,763
Why the hell are you married to me?

1026
01:29:02,847 --> 01:29:05,724
What the hell are you doing
carrying my child?

1027
01:29:05,809 --> 01:29:08,519
I mean, why didn't you just get
rid of it when you had the chance?

1028
01:29:08,603 --> 01:29:11,647
Because listen to me.
Listen to me, I got news for you.

1029
01:29:11,731 --> 01:29:13,899
I wish to God that you had.

1030
01:29:47,976 --> 01:30:15,044
April!

1031
01:30:23,178 --> 01:30:25,095
- April!
- Stay away from me.

1032
01:30:25,221 --> 01:30:27,264
- April, listen.
- Stay away from me.

1033
01:30:27,349 --> 01:30:29,266
Can't I even get away from you
in the fucking woods?

1034
01:30:29,351 --> 01:30:31,352
April, listen, I didn't mean that.

1035
01:30:31,436 --> 01:30:33,812
- Honestly, I didn't mean what I said.
- Are you still talking?

1036
01:30:33,897 --> 01:30:36,732
Isn't there any way to stop your talking?

1037
01:30:37,359 --> 01:30:40,944
I need to think. Can't you see that?
I need to think.

1038
01:30:43,365 --> 01:30:45,157
Please come back to the house.
What're you doing out here, April?

1039
01:30:45,241 --> 01:30:46,825
Do you want me to scream again,
Frank?

1040
01:30:46,910 --> 01:30:49,119
Because I will! I mean it!

1041
01:30:57,796 --> 01:31:00,255
Okay. Okay.

1042
01:34:33,511 --> 01:34:38,599
Good morning.

1043
01:34:40,351 --> 01:34:43,020
Would you like
scrambled eggs or fried?

1044
01:34:47,942 --> 01:34:49,526
I don't know.

1045
01:34:50,278 --> 01:34:55,365
It doesn't really matter.
Scrambled, I guess, if it's easy.

1046
01:34:56,117 --> 01:34:59,119
Fine. I'll have scrambled, too.

1047
01:35:57,053 --> 01:36:01,431
It's kind of nice having breakfast
without the kids for a change, huh?

1048
01:36:01,516 --> 01:36:02,683
Yes.

1049
01:36:03,601 --> 01:36:06,520
I thought you'd probably want
a good breakfast today.

1050
01:36:06,604 --> 01:36:09,856
I mean, it's kind of an important day
for you, isn't it?

1051
01:36:10,692 --> 01:36:14,236
Isn't this the day you have
your conference with Pollock?

1052
01:36:16,364 --> 01:36:18,657
Yes. Yes, that's right.

1053
01:36:20,702 --> 01:36:24,621
- Big deal.
- I imagine it is a pretty big deal.

1054
01:36:25,289 --> 01:36:27,040
For them, anyway.

1055
01:36:28,292 --> 01:36:31,962
What exactly do you think
you'll be doing in your newjob?

1056
01:36:32,338 --> 01:36:35,132
You haven't really
told me much about it.

1057
01:36:35,967 --> 01:36:37,384
Haven't I?

1058
01:36:39,554 --> 01:36:41,763
Well, I think this whole thing
is about Knox getting ready

1059
01:36:41,848 --> 01:36:45,142
to buy up one of those
really big computers,

1060
01:36:45,226 --> 01:36:47,352
even bigger than the 500.

1061
01:36:48,354 --> 01:36:51,732
- Didn't I tell you about that?
- No.

1062
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,443
Why don't you tell me now?

1063
01:36:58,740 --> 01:36:59,823
Well,

1064
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:05,662
you know, basically it's just a big,
fast adding machine.

1065
01:37:07,331 --> 01:37:11,043
Only, instead of mechanical parts,
you see,

1066
01:37:11,753 --> 01:37:17,090
you've got thousands
of individual vacuum tubes.

1067
01:37:27,935 --> 01:37:29,186
I see.

1068
01:37:37,028 --> 01:37:39,071
At least I think I see.

1069
01:37:42,909 --> 01:37:45,994
Yes, it's really kind of interesting,
isn't it?

1070
01:37:48,581 --> 01:37:50,415
Well, I don't know.

1071
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:55,670
Yeah, I guess it is kind of interesting,
in a way.

1072
01:38:00,426 --> 01:38:03,011
You should value what you do, Frank.

1073
01:38:04,263 --> 01:38:06,431
You're obviously good at it.

1074
01:38:21,864 --> 01:38:25,075
Well, I guess
I'd better be getting started, huh?

1075
01:38:31,958 --> 01:38:34,292
Listen, though, April, the...

1076
01:38:36,379 --> 01:38:38,213
This was really nice.

1077
01:38:39,799 --> 01:38:42,884
I mean, it was a swell breakfast.
Really, I...

1078
01:38:43,761 --> 01:38:47,097
I don't know when I've ever had
a nicer breakfast.

1079
01:38:49,350 --> 01:38:53,270
Thank you. I enjoyed it, too.

1080
01:39:15,042 --> 01:39:19,171
Then you don't...
You don't hate me or anything?

1081
01:39:21,799 --> 01:39:25,510
No. No, of course I don't.

1082
01:39:36,272 --> 01:39:37,898
Have a good day.

1083
01:39:44,655 --> 01:39:48,408
Okay, then. So long.

1084
01:41:30,636 --> 01:41:35,181
Hello. Milly? Everything all right?

1085
01:41:37,476 --> 01:41:42,105
Well, no, I'm afraid I'm not feeling
any better. That's really why I called.

1086
01:41:43,649 --> 01:41:47,736
If it's not an inconvenience for you,
this evening would be great.

1087
01:41:48,738 --> 01:41:49,779
What?

1088
01:41:52,491 --> 01:41:57,495
Oh, no. No.
Not if they're outdoors playing.

1089
01:42:01,792 --> 01:42:03,835
Don't call them in.

1090
01:42:03,919 --> 01:42:08,340
Just give them each a kiss for me,

1091
01:42:09,925 --> 01:42:11,843
and tell them I...

1092
01:42:13,512 --> 01:42:15,013
Tell them...

1093
01:42:16,307 --> 01:42:22,187
You know. All right. All right.
Thank you, Milly. Bye.

1094
01:45:54,024 --> 01:45:56,776
I think I need help.

1095
01:45:58,279 --> 01:46:02,240
115 Revolutionary Road.

1096
01:46:29,101 --> 01:46:31,894
- Frank. They tell you what happened?
- Jesus Christ.

1097
01:46:31,979 --> 01:46:34,522
Shep, I didn't understand
half the things he told me.

1098
01:46:34,607 --> 01:46:37,400
He said the foetus was out
before they got her here.

1099
01:46:37,484 --> 01:46:42,196
And they had to operate to take out
the, what do you call it, the placenta?

1100
01:46:42,281 --> 01:46:44,616
And now she's still bleeding.

1101
01:46:44,700 --> 01:46:47,410
He said that she'd lost a lot of blood
before the ambulance came,

1102
01:46:47,494 --> 01:46:49,912
and now they're trying to stop it.

1103
01:46:50,122 --> 01:46:54,500
He said a whole lot of things
I didn't understand about capillaries...

1104
01:46:55,210 --> 01:46:59,589
He said that she's unconscious. Jesus.

1105
01:46:59,673 --> 01:47:01,549
Okay, Frank,
why don't you just take a seat?

1106
01:47:01,634 --> 01:47:04,010
What the hell do I want to sit down for,
for God's sake?

1107
01:47:04,094 --> 01:47:08,264
Okay, Frank. Just take it easy.
Take it easy.

1108
01:47:10,684 --> 01:47:14,145
- Frank, have a cigarette.
- She did it to herself, Shep.

1109
01:47:16,106 --> 01:47:18,066
She did it to herself.

1110
01:47:25,658 --> 01:47:27,909
I'm gonna get you some coffee.

1111
01:48:38,230 --> 01:48:42,358
They were such wonderful people.
Weren't they, Shep?

1112
01:48:43,193 --> 01:48:47,905
It's just devastating. Poor April.

1113
01:48:47,990 --> 01:48:49,323
Thank you.

1114
01:48:50,534 --> 01:48:53,995
Frank lives in the city now.
Where is it that he works?

1115
01:48:55,038 --> 01:48:57,540
- Bart Pollock Associates.
- Computers?

1116
01:48:58,834 --> 01:49:00,752
Interesting firm.

1117
01:49:00,836 --> 01:49:04,130
- Have you seen him since?
- No. Not back here.

1118
01:49:04,214 --> 01:49:08,509
There are too many memories, I think.
Shep has seen him in the city.

1119
01:49:08,594 --> 01:49:10,511
Haven't you, sweetie?

1120
01:49:11,054 --> 01:49:14,182
Frank is just devoted to those kids.

1121
01:49:15,058 --> 01:49:18,144
Every spare moment he has,
he spends with them.

1122
01:49:33,327 --> 01:49:34,660
Excuse me.

1123
01:49:45,923 --> 01:49:47,465
You all right?

1124
01:49:52,846 --> 01:49:56,098
I don't want to talk
about the Wheelers any more.

1125
01:49:57,643 --> 01:49:58,726
Okay.

1126
01:50:01,021 --> 01:50:06,400
We don't have to.

1127
01:50:48,527 --> 01:50:51,279
Daddy, Daddy, watch. Watch, Daddy.

1128
01:50:57,286 --> 01:50:58,995
I can't tell you how pleased I am

1129
01:50:59,079 --> 01:51:02,290
about the little Revolutionary Road
place, Howard.

1130
01:51:02,708 --> 01:51:05,668
And now whenever I drive past,
it gives me such a lift

1131
01:51:05,752 --> 01:51:09,380
to see it all perked up
and spanking clean again.

1132
01:51:09,965 --> 01:51:12,383
All the lights in all the windows.

1133
01:51:13,468 --> 01:51:17,680
And do you know? I was just thinking,
I've loved that little house for years.

1134
01:51:17,764 --> 01:51:22,268
And the Braces are the only really
suitable people I've ever found for it.

1135
01:51:22,853 --> 01:51:25,688
Really nice, congenial people, I mean.

1136
01:51:25,772 --> 01:51:28,482
Well, except for the Wheelers,
you mean.

1137
01:51:30,485 --> 01:51:32,904
I was very fond of the Wheelers.

1138
01:51:33,739 --> 01:51:37,199
They were a bit whimsical for my taste.
A bit neurotic.

1139
01:51:38,327 --> 01:51:39,660
I never stressed it, but they were often

1140
01:51:39,745 --> 01:51:42,914
very trying people
to deal with, in many ways.

1141
01:51:44,207 --> 01:51:49,003
And actually, the main reason
that the little house was so hard to sell

1142
01:51:49,129 --> 01:51:52,256
was because they let it depreciate
so dreadfully.

1143
01:51:52,341 --> 01:51:57,970
Warped window frames, wet cellar,
crayon marks all over the walls,

1144
01:51:58,055 --> 01:52:00,555
filthy smudges around the door knobs
and the fixtures...
