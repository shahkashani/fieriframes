The framework of the world is black and white
The infrastructure builders flex their might
Turning true emotion into digital expression
One by one, we all fall down

The Gray Race shrivels, trapped inside
The world it creates is black and white
The Gray Race shrivels, trapped inside
The world it creates is black and white

The perpetual destructive motion machine
Began to chart a course never before seen
Turning raw compassion into fields of plus and minus
One by one we all give in

The Gray Race shrivels, trapped inside
The world it creates is black and white
The Gray Race shrivels, trapped inside
The world it creates is black and white

I'd swear there were times when I was someone else
A person with determination and knowledge of the self
But you flattened me to rubble and now I can see
That I'm just faded negative of the image I used to be

Just a shadow
And that's our dilemma
Despite that he saw blatant similarity
He struggled to find a distinctive moiety
All he found was vulgar superficiality
But he focused it to sharpness
And shared it with the others
It signified his anger and misery

Them and us
Lobbying determined through a mire of disbelievers
Them and us
Dire perpetuation and incongruous insistence
That there really is a difference between them and us

Hate is a simple manifestation
Of the deep-seated self-directed frustration
All it does is promote fear and consternation
It's the inability to justify the enemy
And it fills us all with trepidation

Them and us
Bending the significance to match a whimsied fable
Them and us
Tumult for the ignorant and purpose for the violence
A confused loose alliance, forming them and us

And I heard him say
We can take them all
We can take them all
We can take them all (That's what he said)
We can take them all
But he didn't know who we were
And he didn't know who they were
And there wasn't any reason or motive or value to his story
Just allegory, imitation glory
And a desperate, feeble search for a friend
Go!
Them and us
Lobbying determined through a mire of disbelievers
Them and us
Dire perpetuation and incongruous insistence
Tumult for the ignorant and purpose for the violence
A confused loose alliance, forming them and us
We can take them all
We can take them all
I'm going for a walk
Not the after dinner kind
I'm gonna use my hands
And I'm gonna use my mind

And who the hell are you to tell me what to do?
You can't even tie your own haggard shoes
Your closet is a mess, your backyard's falling down
And I have no grand ideas or intention of sticking around

So I'm going for a walk
Not the after dinner kind
I'm gonna use my hands
And I'm gonna use my mind

I'm gonna build a world
Independent and exempt
All alone, I'll be an empire
With no mortgage and no rent

And I don't need to live in your stinking zoo
You can't even feed the animals donated to you
Your storage sheds are ramshackled, flies decorate the walls
And you expect me to die here in this shit-filled tiny stall?

I'm going for a walk!
And I know you're watching everything I do
Call me "threat to your children", call me "socially unglued"
Call me "master of insanity", "unable to relate"
Call me "lazy", "bane", and "filthy"
Call me "monstrous reprobate"

I'm going for a walk and there's nothing you can do
Cause I don't have to live like you
I'm going for a walk

Going for a walk
Going for a walk
I'm going for a walk
I'm going for a walk
I'm going for a walk
I'm going for a walk
I'm going for a walk
I'm going for a walk

I'm going for a walk!
Sleeping on a time bomb, staring into space
There's an ocean of unpleasantries we are not prepared to face
Sitting on the fence post to watch the storm roll in
And terrified of the damage it will bring when it begins
It will begin

Splintered dreams of unity (our lives are parallel)
So far from reality (our lives are parallel)
Independent trajectories (our lives are parallel)
Separate terms of equality (our lives are parallel)
Our lives are parallel

Is there no redemption? No common good?
Is there nothing we can do for ourselves or only what we should?
Comes the hard admission of what we don't provide
Goes the insistence on the ways and means that so divide
They so divide

Side by side, suffering loneliness (our lives are parallel)
Phony collective progress (our lives are parallel)
Accepting that it's all such a mess (our lives are parallel)
Gesturing without hope of redress (our lives are parallel)
Our lives are parallel

Forging little plays of deception and pain
As we watch our foundations crumble away
Staggering like birds against a hurricane
And trying all the while to stay out of each other's way

Broken dreams of unity (our lives are parallel)
Independent trajectories (our lives are parallel)
Screaming out for understanding (our lives are parallel)
Turning inward and suffering (our lives are parallel)
Have you been to the desert?
Have you walked with the dead?
There's a hundred thousand children being killed for their bread
And the figures don't lie, they speak of human disease
But we do what we want and we think what we please

Have you lived the experience?
Have you witnessed the plague?
People making babies, sometimes just to escape
In this land of competition, the compassion is gone
Yet, we ignore the needy and we keep pushing on
Keep pushing on...

This is just a punk rock song
Written for the people who can see something's wrong
Like ants in a colony we do our share
But there's so many other fuckin' insects out there
And this is just a punk rock song

Have you visited the quagmire?
Have you swam in the shit?
The party convention and the real politik
The faces always different, the rhetoric the same
But we swallow it all and we see nothing change
Nothing has changed...

This is just a punk rock song
Written for the people who can see something's wrong
Like workers in a factory we do our share
But there's so many other fuckin' robots out there
This is just a punk rock song

10 million dollars on a losing campaign
20 million starving and writhing in pain
Big, strong people, unwilling to give
Small in vision and perspective

One in five kids below the poverty line
One population runnin' out of time
Runnin' out of time

This is just a punk rock song
Written for the people who can see something's wrong
Like ants in a colony we do our share
But there's so many other fuckin' insects out there
This is just a punk rock song

The figures don't lie, they speak of human disease
But we do what we want and we think what we please
One in five kids below the poverty line
One population runnin' out of time
Everywhere you looked
There was confusion violence, drama and drugs
So many righteous revolutionaries spouting utopian love
Everyone shrouded in purple haze
Then one day, they woke up from their dream state
They found themselves no more at peace than before
Older, meek and conformed

Empty causes
A bluster for the soul, a fix for the mind
Empty causes
Cling to everything you find

Well, the shots rang out like popcorn
And the Chief was hit and rushed out of sight
The mohawk-chain, leather brigade
Rejoiced maliciously on that night
Someone cried out, "fuck the government"
His mates couldn't define what he meant
So no one gave him the time of day and the scene died away

Empty causes
A war for the body, an army in the mind
Empty causes
Losing steam as time goes by

Could it be that everybody selfishly desires
Their own personal retinue
And that causes are just manifestations of too much time
And far to little to do?

Empty causes
Direction for the soul, conviction for the mind
Empty causes
Cling to it all, everything you find
Empty causes
A war for the body and an army in the mind
Empty causes
You've got yours and I've got mine
Hey mister, don't point at me
You shout rhetoric nonsense
Like a Pavlovian model responding to questions
Hey teacher, arrogance is bliss
You spend your time turning water into life
As if you were God's foreman

Is it any wonder things seem so awry?
We swim in sea of confusion and don't have to think to survive
So nobody listens

Hey recluse, don't shout at me
You proclaim yourself expert
By extension of the methods detailed in your magazines
Hey downer, don't prey on me
We've all got bum raps that torment us day to day
That we hoist on our own shoulders

Is it any wonder people pass you by?
Your plea for understanding is heard as desperate lies
So nobody listens

I can't help you
I can't help you
I can't help you
I can't help you now

Is it any wonder things are so inane?
So many quests for compassion
Are just for someone's personal gain
So nobody listens
Nobody listens to you
There's a boy in crimson rags with a grimace and a spoon
And a little sullen girl face-up staring at the moon
And there's no one around to hear their lonesome cries
Then they pass away alone into the night

Why do we pity the dead?
Are you churned by emotion from voices in your head?
Look at all the living and you'll ask yourself why
Oh why do we pity the dead?

Well, you've seen the disease, suffering and decay
And you whisper to yourself, blissfully, "it's okay"
And you still refuse the possibility
That the dead are better off than we

Why do we pity the dead?
Are you scared of the logic that swirls within your head?
Look at all the living and you'll ask yourself why
Oh, why do we pity the dead?

Tell me what you see
Tell me what you know
Is there anyone who lives a painless life?
If there is, show me so
The destitute and famished
Demonic and the banished
Dejected and the ostracized
The brainwashed and the paralyzed
The conquered and objectified
The few who see the other side
Tell me what you see
It's a mortal, wretched cacophony

In the end, you may find there's no guiding, subtle light
No ancestors, no friends, no judge of wrong or right
Just eternal silence and dormancy
And a final, everlasting peace

Why do we pity the dead?
Are you churned by emotion from voices in your head?
Look at all the living and you'll ask yourself why
Oh why do we pity the dead?
Shed a tear for the criminal, give him something to believe
Light a fire for the miserable, give the darkness some meaning
Closed wounds harbor pestilence when you lick them from within
Charity has a redolence chastity cannot rescind

Spirit shine, it's a sign
Of a tortured mind
Spirit shine all the time
Can render you blind

You can take it all to heart or throw it all away
You can call it just a lark or live your life that way
You can give until you're dry and sucked of all your gleam
You can fake another cry and compromise your dream

Cling tight to the parable, let it dominate your life
Create a God who's infallible, give your leader some respite
Closed wounds harbor pestilence when you lick them from within
Rosy smiles lose their radiance when you take it on the chin

Spirit shine, it's a sign
Of a troubled mind
Spirit shine all the time
Can render you blind
Desolate and without purpose
Radiating from so many septic sources
Forming the fabric of a wayward people
Disappearing as the vestiges of our past
Scratched like tartan into virgin soil
A substrate for progress and disarray
A spreading network of broken dreams
Searching for a thoroughfare to take us away

Just a little tale from the streets of America
Sparkled promises, paved with pathos and hysteria
Trenchant, weary native sons
Step back and see the damage done
Meander to the horizon
The streets of America

Black, tarred concrete, pine for me
Lying dormant for you and country
Hardened surface, cracked within
Catch the sweat from off of the chin
Of men and women, senior and child
Who look to you and your sterile miles
And in their stares is bald dismay
For what you fucking promised when you led them astray
Hard-cracked, daunting, lifeless veins
False hope corridors to greener pastures is all that remains

Say a little prayer for the streets of America
Sparkled promises, paved with pathos and hysteria
Trenchant, weary native sons
Step back and see the damage done
Shoot straight into the horizon
The streets of America
Parched, cracked mouths, empty swollen guts
Sun-baked pavement encroaches on us
Haves and have-nots together at last
Brutally engaged in mortal combat

What kind of God orchestrates such a thing?
(Ten In 2010, ten In 2010)
Ten billion people all suffering
(Ten In 2010, ten In 2010)
Truth is not an issue, just a hungry mouths to feed
(Ten In 2010, ten In 2010)
Forget what you want, scrounge the things you need
(Ten In 2010, ten In 2010)

Ten In 2010

Ahhhh!

Happy and content, it can't happen to you
(Ten In 2010, ten In 2010)
Fifteen years? We'll think of a solution!
(Ten In 2010, ten In 2010)
It won't just appear one day
(Ten In 2010, ten In 2010)
For ten in 2010, we're well on our way

Like piercing ear darts, I heard the news today
Ten billion people coming your way
Ten In 20-

The velveteen and oaken fixtures soothed the lonely child
The parents watched the escort take him while they stood outside
The priest was kind and gentle as he positioned his head
The pain was like brimstone, but the kid hardly bled

Victory
Instinct over intellect
Victory
It erupts from deep inside
History
History is laughing at us plotting its discovery
Victory, victory
Blame it on the victory

Among the parade crowd there stands a decorated man
Remembering how he helped to save this sacred land
His helpless enemy was wounded, both hands raised with hope
He killed him without second thought with brute force and a rope
So many times, so many lives test the other side
Waiting to see what the maker has in mind

The unsuspecting commoners hum diligent each day
They wallow in their father's sins as time passes away
The crimes are without motive but they ignore all restraint
The evil sits inside them torpid, timing its escape
Blame it on the victory
Blame it on the victory
Plotting its discovery
Victory, victory
Blame it on the victory
The smell of virgin pages wafted through the swinging doors
And the croaking speech he'd heard from countless counselors before
They said "We all care for you, we know how you suffer
But I know you can succeed, I used to have it so much rougher"

There's hope in the words and emotion in the eyes
It's so easy to be misled by the savvy, gentle guise
And like fools, we trust the delivery
But it's all just drunk sincerity
It's all just drunk sincerity

In maternal family assembly, poised, regarding the blue tube
The numbers crept up higher and the hawks stayed out of view
Then the generals said, "We don't want our boys dead
Your sons and your husbands will be coming back heroes soon"

There's hope in the words and emotion in the eyes
It's so easy to be misled by the savvy, gentle guise
And like fools, we trust the delivery
But it's all just drunk sincerity
It's all just drunk sincerity

With steam, heat, and rhythm in the back seat of the car
And adolescent perspective, projecting life's forecast to the stars
You heard love from the lips and you were rapt by the hips
And the promise was eternal, but you couldn't see that far

There's hope in the words and emotion in the eyes
It's so easy to be misled by the savvy, gentle guise
And like fools, we trust the delivery
But it's all just drunk sincerity
It's all just drunk sincerity
It's all just drunk sincerity
It is all just drunk sincerity
So you say you gotta know why the world goes around
And you can't find the truth in the things you've found
And you're scared shitless 'cause evil abounds
Come join us
Well I heard you were looking for a place to fit in
Full of adherent people with the same objective
A family to cling to and call brethren
Come join us

All we want to do is change your mind
All you need to do is close your eyes
Come join us
Come join us
Come join us

Don't you see the trouble that most people are in?
And that they just want you for their own advantage?
But I swear to you, we're different from all of them
Come join us
I can tell you are looking for a way to live
Where truth is determined by consensus
Full of codified, arbitrary directives
Come join us

All we want to have is your small mind
Turn it into one of our own kind
You can go through life adrift and alone
Desperate, desolate, on your own
But we're looking for a few more stalwart clones
Come join us
Come join us
Come join us

We've got spite and dedication as a vehement brew
The world hates us, well we hate them, too
But you're exempted, of course, if you
Come join us
Independent, self-contented, revolutionary
Intellectual, brave, strong and scholarly
If you're not one of them, you're us already so
Come join us
Come join us
Come join us
Come join us
Blacktop pavement cover me
Like a chemical reaction or a steam roller spreading randomly
There's a distant buzz at low frequency
It tickles my ear, it rumbles under my feet
And it shakes the leaves off of every tree violently

What pretension! Everlasting peace
Everything must cease

Institution on the Hill
Like a beacon in the mind of an ancestor to ignite a people's will
There's a shadowed stain on the west facade
It has spread like decay to enshroud the fraud
And the descendants find it oh, so odd
Grave memorial, hewn white stone
Like the comforting caress of a mother
Or a friend you've always known
It evokes such pain and significance
What was once is reduced to remembrance
And the generations pass without recompense
