1
00:01:44,385 --> 00:01:47,429
Audrey, you're a high school girl.

2
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:49,566
I'm an agent of the FBI.

3
00:01:50,487 --> 00:01:53,615
So do you want me to leave or what?

4
00:01:55,713 --> 00:02:00,683
What I want and what I need
are two different things, Audrey.

5
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:07,073
When a man joins the Bureau he takes
an oath to uphold certain values.

6
00:02:07,073 --> 00:02:10,425
Values that he's sworn to live by.

7
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:14,476
This is wrong, Audrey.
We both know it.

8
00:02:17,868 --> 00:02:22,541
But don't you like me?
- I like you very much.

9
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:25,976
You're beautiful, intelligent, desirable.

10
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,517
Everything a man wants in his life.

11
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:32,958
But what you need right now,
more than anything, is a friend.

12
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:35,296
Someone who will listen.

13
00:02:51,311 --> 00:02:53,188
Friends, huh?

14
00:02:57,581 --> 00:03:01,040
I'm gonna go and get us two malts
and some fries.

15
00:03:01,302 --> 00:03:05,140
Then tell me all your troubles.
- That could take all night.

16
00:03:06,778 --> 00:03:08,904
The night is young.

17
00:03:10,037 --> 00:03:14,376
Now, I'm gonna get the food,
and you're gonna get dressed.

18
00:03:15,345 --> 00:03:20,103
I can't tell you all my secrets.
- Secrets are dangerous things.

19
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:23,830
Do you have any?
- No.

20
00:03:24,124 --> 00:03:26,037
Laura had a lot of secrets.

21
00:03:27,596 --> 00:03:30,804
Finding those out is my job.

22
00:03:57,794 --> 00:04:00,041
Good morning, Officer Brennan.

23
00:04:00,929 --> 00:04:04,771
I sure wish you would stop calling me
Officer Brennan.

24
00:04:05,193 --> 00:04:08,319
Officer Andy, this is peak activity time

25
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,034
at the station switchboard.

26
00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:15,559
So it's really not convenient
for me to talk right now.

27
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:20,148
Twin Peaks Sheriff's Station,
may I help you?

28
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:22,990
One moment, please.

29
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:36,335
Doctor Stanicek? Yes, it's me.

30
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:40,263
Oh.

31
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:44,696
Uh-huh.

32
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,287
Well...

33
00:04:49,837 --> 00:04:52,680
thank you, Doctor.

34
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,355
No, I'm fine.

35
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,483
Bye.

36
00:05:06,684 --> 00:05:09,228
Morning, Lucy.
I heard you were out sick.

37
00:05:09,228 --> 00:05:12,194
I'm much better today, thanks.

38
00:05:13,498 --> 00:05:14,746
Good.

39
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:20,075
I found it: "Gracula religiosa.

40
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:22,988
"Commonly known as the hill mynah.

41
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:26,865
"Native to Southeast Asia,
Indonesia.

42
00:05:27,085 --> 00:05:31,389
"Feeds on fruit mainly,
some invertebrates.

43
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,858
"Its ability to mimic the human voice
is amazing."

44
00:05:34,858 --> 00:05:40,035
Yeah, well, so far we haven't heard
a peep. Hey, Waldo, what's up?

45
00:05:40,254 --> 00:05:45,343
It says here that mimicry
is a kind of play with the mynah.

46
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,362
But this one's in a weakened condition.
Starved, dehydrated.

47
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:55,258
I'd say he's feeling anything
but playful.

48
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:57,758
Here you go, little fella.

49
00:05:58,937 --> 00:06:02,648
You want to feed him, Agent Cooper?
- I don't like birds.

50
00:06:02,869 --> 00:06:05,413
When do you think
he'll start talking?

51
00:06:05,413 --> 00:06:11,638
According to the book, his urge to
mimic should return with his health.

52
00:06:11,857 --> 00:06:17,622
If it does, then we got a witness.
- Well, we better keep feeding him.

53
00:06:18,376 --> 00:06:22,134
You got any apples?
- Yeah. There's some in the fridge.

54
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:27,437
These grapes are on the edge.
- These came in from your office.

55
00:06:29,704 --> 00:06:33,296
Forensics confirms Jacques
had three guests to his cabin:

56
00:06:33,551 --> 00:06:37,428
Laura Palmer, Ronnette Pulaski
and Leo Johnson.

57
00:06:39,194 --> 00:06:44,081
That was the only exposed negative
on the roll of film. Look familiar?

58
00:06:44,081 --> 00:06:47,885
That's our Waldo.
- No, Harry, the girl.

59
00:06:48,098 --> 00:06:50,012
That's Laura.

60
00:06:51,818 --> 00:06:57,169
Well, now we know who and when.
We don't know why.

61
00:06:59,217 --> 00:07:01,594
Voice activated, Harry.

62
00:07:01,934 --> 00:07:06,653
When the bird talks,
maybe we'll get some answers.

63
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:11,963
This matches the fragment
found in Laura's stomach.

64
00:07:12,635 --> 00:07:17,688
A chip from One-Eyed Jacks.
- Renault deals in the casino.

65
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:22,866
A little fieldwork is in order.
- Jacks is over the border.

66
00:07:23,085 --> 00:07:24,918
Well, I know that, Harry.

67
00:07:25,135 --> 00:07:29,223
That's why I was thinking this would
be a job for the Bookhouse Boys.

68
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:49,329
Better call Hawk on that one.

69
00:07:52,557 --> 00:07:54,470
Shelly!

70
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,440
Bobby Briggs.

71
00:08:08,226 --> 00:08:11,401
Come on, lover-boy. Leo's waiting.

72
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:19,258
I called, but your dad answered.
- Bobby's here, baby. Bobby's here.

73
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:28,029
I shot him, Bobby.

74
00:08:28,292 --> 00:08:30,752
I know I did.

75
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:37,024
He just screamed and screamed.
He sounded like an animal.

76
00:08:37,237 --> 00:08:39,152
You what?

77
00:08:39,411 --> 00:08:42,371
Slow down, Shelly. Talk to me.

78
00:08:42,587 --> 00:08:46,381
He's out there, I know he is.
He's gonna kill me.

79
00:08:46,381 --> 00:08:50,436
Bobby, he's gonna kill me.
- Shelly!

80
00:08:51,325 --> 00:08:55,284
Start over. Go real slow.

81
00:08:59,268 --> 00:09:02,060
Leo came home late last night.

82
00:09:02,277 --> 00:09:05,239
He was all beat up.
He had blood all over him.

83
00:09:05,747 --> 00:09:11,264
I told him I was never ever
gonna let him hurt me again.

84
00:09:11,473 --> 00:09:16,610
But he came at me.
So I pulled the trigger.

85
00:09:19,122 --> 00:09:21,751
I shot him, Bobby.

86
00:09:22,174 --> 00:09:25,932
What am I gonna do?
Where am I gonna hide?

87
00:09:26,147 --> 00:09:31,532
Shelly, Leo Johnson is history.
Understand?

88
00:09:31,748 --> 00:09:35,005
I'm taking care of you from now on.

89
00:09:35,258 --> 00:09:38,635
I'm gonna deal with Leo.
I'm gonna deal with James.

90
00:09:38,853 --> 00:09:41,399
Bobby's gonna deal with everything.

91
00:09:53,234 --> 00:09:58,751
Birdseed? No, this bird eats fruit.
The sheriff says it's a witness.

92
00:09:58,961 --> 00:10:04,346
No, not just because it saw something,
because it talks. It needs to eat...

93
00:10:28,317 --> 00:10:30,992
What's up, Doc?

94
00:10:31,702 --> 00:10:35,495
Just a few words before I go to sleep.

95
00:10:36,204 --> 00:10:39,831
I feel like I'm gonna dream tonight.

96
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:43,057
Big bad ones, you know?

97
00:10:44,022 --> 00:10:46,815
The kind you like.

98
00:10:50,877 --> 00:10:54,133
It's easier talking into the recorder.

99
00:10:54,891 --> 00:10:58,432
I guess I feel I can say anything.

100
00:10:58,651 --> 00:11:01,577
All my secrets.

101
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:07,085
The naked ones.
I know you like those, Doc.

102
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:10,521
I know you like me, too.

103
00:11:10,776 --> 00:11:13,901
That'll be my little secret, OK?

104
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:17,542
Just like your coconut.

105
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:23,516
Why is it so easy to make men like me?

106
00:11:23,732 --> 00:11:27,407
And I don't even have to try
very hard.

107
00:11:27,407 --> 00:11:29,909
Or maybe...

108
00:11:30,713 --> 00:11:32,795
...if it was harder...

109
00:11:36,273 --> 00:11:38,652
This one's empty.

110
00:11:40,997 --> 00:11:44,208
February 23rd.
The night Laura died.

111
00:11:48,731 --> 00:11:52,320
The tape's not in there.
- He must still have it.

112
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:57,582
She died, he never returned it.
- Do you think Dr Jacoby killed her?

113
00:11:58,972 --> 00:12:01,980
We're gonna find that tape. Tonight.

114
00:12:02,651 --> 00:12:06,407
Where?
- Jacoby's office.

115
00:12:06,622 --> 00:12:11,045
What if he's there?
- We'll get him out.

116
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:13,561
How?

117
00:12:14,941 --> 00:12:19,198
Maybe he gets a phone call.
From Laura.

118
00:12:24,932 --> 00:12:27,643
What's up, Doc?

119
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:33,786
Just a few words before I go to sleep.
I feel like I'm gonna dream tonight.

120
00:12:41,452 --> 00:12:45,673
Here, try this.
It smells like a florist.

121
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:50,182
This won't do.
I want something more fruity.

122
00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:53,448
Fruity?
- As in fruit.

123
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,254
Jenny, could I see you in my office
in five minutes?

124
00:12:58,254 --> 00:13:02,346
I'm not making myself clear.
I want to make a statement.

125
00:13:02,563 --> 00:13:05,773
Maybe you should try hanging it
around your neck.

126
00:13:05,989 --> 00:13:08,617
It's a perfume,
it's a fashion accessory.

127
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:11,163
Two statements for the price of one.

128
00:13:11,163 --> 00:13:14,633
I don't appreciate your attitude.

129
00:13:16,147 --> 00:13:19,775
Well, thank you for shopping
at Horne's Department Store.

130
00:13:28,436 --> 00:13:31,896
I'm going to the girls' room.
- OK.

131
00:13:41,814 --> 00:13:46,784
There's a real bad accident outside.
It sounded like a bus or something.

132
00:14:05,515 --> 00:14:08,440
Come right this way, Jenny.

133
00:14:11,075 --> 00:14:15,628
I have something really special
to talk about today.

134
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,932
Come right in.
My, my, you look lovely.

135
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:23,028
Sit, sit.
- Thank you, Mr Battis.

136
00:14:23,241 --> 00:14:29,256
This is for you, Jenny.
A reward for a job well done.

137
00:14:43,473 --> 00:14:45,053
It's a unicorn.

138
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:50,656
Ancient symbol of purity.
Tamed only by the young at heart.

139
00:14:50,871 --> 00:14:53,713
Wow, a unicorn.

140
00:14:54,383 --> 00:15:00,399
Have a good time at the club?
- I had a great time, Mr Battis.

141
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,952
They were pleased with you
as well, I must say.

142
00:15:04,164 --> 00:15:08,550
They'd like you to continue.
Believe me, not many girls qualify.

143
00:15:08,762 --> 00:15:11,342
Really?
- Yes.

144
00:15:11,564 --> 00:15:17,829
Now the variety of work is completely
up to you. Hostess, cocktail waitress.

145
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:23,095
Or, if you are chosen,
hospitality girl.

146
00:15:24,062 --> 00:15:25,644
What's that?

147
00:15:27,782 --> 00:15:34,084
Hospitality girls escort
important guests, VIPs.

148
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:37,864
It's a lucrative opportunity, Jenny.

149
00:15:37,864 --> 00:15:42,299
Attending to wealthy men
in need of a little company.

150
00:15:42,557 --> 00:15:45,516
That sounds cool.
As long as they're wealthy.

151
00:15:46,027 --> 00:15:51,626
Jenny, your attitude will take you
far in this life.

152
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:55,635
Call this number, ask for Black Rose.

153
00:15:55,891 --> 00:15:59,600
Why don't we go to Eveningwear
and find you something elegant?

154
00:15:59,862 --> 00:16:03,536
Elegant sounds great, Mr Battis.
Elegant.

155
00:16:03,751 --> 00:16:06,591
How do you feel about rose?

156
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:26,612
Ronnette Pulaski.

157
00:16:41,838 --> 00:16:44,762
In prison, you remember faces
from home.

158
00:16:45,042 --> 00:16:47,966
Even people you barely knew
seem like friends.

159
00:16:47,986 --> 00:16:52,542
It's something to hang on to.
- Must've been hard on you.

160
00:16:52,859 --> 00:16:57,864
I paid my debt, that's what counts.
You were a really big help around here.

161
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,544
I wanna thank you
for getting Norma through.

162
00:17:01,544 --> 00:17:04,174
You're welcome, Hank.
It's no problem.

163
00:17:04,174 --> 00:17:09,157
She told me in her letters how much
it meant, how much Pete helped.

164
00:17:09,157 --> 00:17:12,872
Pete?
- Yeah. No, not Pete...

165
00:17:13,091 --> 00:17:15,386
No, you mean Ed.
- Yeah, Big Ed.

166
00:17:16,687 --> 00:17:20,645
Yeah, I'm a little better at faces
than names, I guess.

167
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:27,304
Yeah, Big Ed.

168
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,804
Shelly, can we get another cup
over here?

169
00:17:44,527 --> 00:17:49,698
Hello, Hank.
- Hi, Harry. Glad to see me?

170
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,770
You looking for a free lunch?

171
00:17:54,476 --> 00:17:58,435
I recommend the meatloaf.
- Well, save it. I'm looking for you.

172
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:01,883
Harry, I'm innocent.
- What you are is on parole.

173
00:18:02,591 --> 00:18:06,298
You pay your case officer
a visit once a week, Fridays.

174
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,355
You miss a visit, you go to jail.
Got it?

175
00:18:09,386 --> 00:18:12,102
Thanks for the reminder, Sheriff.

176
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:14,704
Stop in any time.

177
00:18:16,505 --> 00:18:19,182
You think people
really change, Cooper?

178
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:20,978
I don't.

179
00:18:21,188 --> 00:18:25,112
Oh, afternoon, guys.
Would you like some coffee?

180
00:18:25,268 --> 00:18:28,274
Afternoon, Shelly. Yes.
- We should be on our way.

181
00:18:29,574 --> 00:18:31,071
Harry...

182
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:34,620
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

183
00:18:34,841 --> 00:18:39,763
Every day, once a day,
give yourself a present.

184
00:18:39,763 --> 00:18:45,244
Don't plan it, don't wait for it,
just let it happen.

185
00:18:45,794 --> 00:18:50,549
Could be a new shirt,
a catnap in your office chair...

186
00:18:50,851 --> 00:18:54,441
or two cups of good,
hot, black coffee.

187
00:18:54,653 --> 00:18:57,448
Like this.
- A present.

188
00:18:57,664 --> 00:19:00,792
Like Christmas?
- Yeah.

189
00:19:08,699 --> 00:19:11,542
Man, that hits the spot.

190
00:19:14,761 --> 00:19:16,641
Nothing like a great cup
of black coffee.

191
00:19:20,822 --> 00:19:22,071
Bye, Audrey.

192
00:19:22,071 --> 00:19:25,666
So did Battis get you a dress?
- Yeah, he did.

193
00:19:25,922 --> 00:19:30,094
Me, too. I'm gonna be hostess.
- Oh, really. Cool.

194
00:19:30,311 --> 00:19:34,568
Get one of these, too?
- What will I do with a horned horse?

195
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:38,648
Ditto. I bet he's cartons of them.
- He probably does.

196
00:19:38,863 --> 00:19:41,074
God, I did a really dumb thing.

197
00:19:41,287 --> 00:19:45,675
I lost that number he gave me
for Black Rose, do you have it?

198
00:19:46,596 --> 00:19:48,594
Yeah. I got it.
- Great.

199
00:19:53,453 --> 00:19:54,867
Here.

200
00:19:58,383 --> 00:19:59,717
Thanks.

201
00:20:00,016 --> 00:20:03,640
OK, I'll talk to you later.
- OK, see you tomorrow.

202
00:20:16,945 --> 00:20:19,155
I wasn't fooling, Montana.

203
00:20:19,369 --> 00:20:25,053
You show them, Chet.
You show all of them.

204
00:20:30,991 --> 00:20:35,913
Tune in tomorrow for
"Invitation to Love".

205
00:20:40,562 --> 00:20:41,312
Ed.

206
00:20:43,572 --> 00:20:46,332
I'm eating bonbons.

207
00:20:52,226 --> 00:20:57,529
Come on, honey. It's not that bad.
- You don't know how bad it is.

208
00:20:58,162 --> 00:21:02,549
You don't know all the things
I was gonna do for us.

209
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,341
I know.

210
00:21:05,017 --> 00:21:08,524
A new TV. I was gonna do that.

211
00:21:08,905 --> 00:21:12,864
I already looked at a motorboat.
- Sweetheart...

212
00:21:14,256 --> 00:21:20,224
It wasn't just things I was gonna buy.
It was the new life we were gonna lead.

213
00:21:20,484 --> 00:21:23,326
Nadine, there's plenty
of patent attorneys.

214
00:21:23,326 --> 00:21:27,250
We just gotta find one
who understands drape runners.

215
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:32,767
Rejected.
Rejected, that's what he said.

216
00:21:33,024 --> 00:21:39,292
Nobody will say anything different.
- Don't give up. Don't you dare.

217
00:21:46,067 --> 00:21:51,536
I just got that baby back
from Tim and Tom's Taxidermy.

218
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,508
When I caught him,
he was this big.

219
00:21:57,729 --> 00:22:02,866
I guess by the time they take the
innards out and put the stuffing in...

220
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:06,167
it loses something
in the translation.

221
00:22:06,424 --> 00:22:11,644
Well, Pete, it's still a fine looking
trophy, no matter what the size.

222
00:22:11,901 --> 00:22:16,907
Yeah, well,
size isn't everything, I guess.

223
00:22:17,168 --> 00:22:21,674
Harry, I didn't expect you
to be here.

224
00:22:22,728 --> 00:22:27,150
I'm late for the mill,
but I'll make time for us.

225
00:22:27,994 --> 00:22:29,195
What's wrong?

226
00:22:29,212 --> 00:22:33,135
What were you doing
at the Timber Falls Motel Tuesday?

227
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,946
Tuesday, I was at the mill.
- Hawk saw you.

228
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,826
I know you were there.

229
00:22:43,509 --> 00:22:45,006
Harry...

230
00:22:46,726 --> 00:22:51,732
You can tell me anything.
Josie, you can tell me anything.

231
00:22:52,244 --> 00:22:58,345
I was there because Ben and Catherine
were there together.

232
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:03,862
I followed them, and I took pictures.

233
00:23:16,031 --> 00:23:18,157
What's this all about?

234
00:23:18,413 --> 00:23:21,956
You asked me for proof last time...

235
00:23:22,176 --> 00:23:26,813
and I followed them
and I took pictures.

236
00:23:28,278 --> 00:23:32,451
The other night I heard Catherine
talking on the phone.

237
00:23:32,668 --> 00:23:37,804
Something about an accident.
A fire.

238
00:23:38,018 --> 00:23:40,432
A fire at the mill.

239
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:47,209
A fire at Andrew's mill. My mill.

240
00:23:49,055 --> 00:23:53,727
I'm not gonna let this happen. No.

241
00:23:56,747 --> 00:24:01,419
Neither will I. I won't let it happen.

242
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:23,011
Well, now.
- Evening, Harry. Ed, you all set?

243
00:24:23,649 --> 00:24:26,611
Is that what you're wearing?
- It's pretty spiffy.

244
00:24:26,611 --> 00:24:28,573
Like to gamble, Ed?

245
00:24:29,587 --> 00:24:32,796
I went to Reno once.
But I never felt too lucky.

246
00:24:32,796 --> 00:24:35,219
Well, you're gonna be lucky tonight.

247
00:24:37,152 --> 00:24:40,862
It's $10,000 of the Bureau's money.

248
00:24:42,044 --> 00:24:47,976
Whenever I gamble, I bring back 10 to 15%.
How much you wanna start with?

249
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:51,192
How about 300?

250
00:24:51,784 --> 00:24:54,279
And, Ed, the suit is perfect.

251
00:24:56,006 --> 00:24:58,585
Well, Harry'd like to talk with you.

252
00:24:58,847 --> 00:25:01,976
So why don't I see you outside?

253
00:25:03,757 --> 00:25:06,089
Yeah, Harry, what's on your mind?

254
00:25:07,353 --> 00:25:10,728
I'm worried about Josie.
She's been real afraid.

255
00:25:10,949 --> 00:25:14,323
About what?
- Ben Horne and Catherine Martell.

256
00:25:14,835 --> 00:25:20,268
They've seen each other on the side
for years, Josie just found out.

257
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:26,746
She thinks they're planning to burn
down the mill and get rid of her.

258
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,123
Well, do you believe her?

259
00:25:29,123 --> 00:25:32,842
Ben Horne wants that land
for Ghostwood development,

260
00:25:32,842 --> 00:25:34,605
and Josie won't sell.

261
00:25:34,605 --> 00:25:38,276
Yeah, I believe her.
- How much do you know about her?

262
00:25:38,276 --> 00:25:41,246
Where she's from?
Who she was before?

263
00:25:41,504 --> 00:25:44,881
What are you getting at?
- The truth. That's my job.

264
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:49,190
I know all I need to know.
I love her, and she's in trouble.

265
00:25:49,573 --> 00:25:52,782
That's good enough for me.
Let's look into it.

266
00:25:53,795 --> 00:25:55,673
Thanks.

267
00:25:55,885 --> 00:25:59,429
Is Hawk ready?
- Yeah, he's outside in the van.

268
00:25:59,689 --> 00:26:05,241
I got that new Cadillac you wanted.
- Good. It's perfect for our cover.

269
00:26:05,457 --> 00:26:09,715
High rollers from the Tri-Cities?
- Oral surgeons, Harry.

270
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:13,519
Big spenders vacationing
among the firs.

271
00:26:28,824 --> 00:26:31,917
Yeah, has Agent Cooper returned yet?

272
00:26:32,169 --> 00:26:36,675
I need to leave another message.
Tell him that Audrey called again.

273
00:26:36,935 --> 00:26:39,477
Yes, it's still urgent.

274
00:26:43,121 --> 00:26:46,380
Thanks for seeing me, Mrs Martell.
- It's all right.

275
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:51,222
Normally I never impose this late.
- That's fine. What's this about?

276
00:26:51,222 --> 00:26:54,856
Every agent is instructed,
five signatures...

277
00:26:55,117 --> 00:26:58,044
and, somehow, we missed one.

278
00:26:58,253 --> 00:27:03,058
Refresh my memory. What policy?
- Your new life insurance.

279
00:27:03,058 --> 00:27:09,488
Since the binder takes effect tonight,
I had no choice. It couldn't wait.

280
00:27:10,251 --> 00:27:12,628
Right here, please.

281
00:27:17,482 --> 00:27:20,490
Is everything in order, Mrs Martell?

282
00:27:21,662 --> 00:27:23,209
Yes, it's just...

283
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:33,909
This was handled without our meeting
each other, and I'd almost forgotten.

284
00:27:34,162 --> 00:27:38,669
To be honest with you, Mrs Martell,
I withheld that last page.

285
00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:42,979
Did you?
- I admit, I thought it unusual.

286
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:47,066
Life insurance, and the client
is too busy to be involved?

287
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:50,837
I mean, you did know
about this policy, didn't you?

288
00:27:51,385 --> 00:27:55,972
Are you suggesting that there's
something irregular at work here?

289
00:27:55,972 --> 00:28:00,828
I never got that idea from
Mrs Packard. Or from Mr Horne.

290
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:05,630
When he offered to collect signatures,
I thought it was fine. Just with...

291
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:10,443
a new account, I like to be
certain to cross every "t".

292
00:28:10,443 --> 00:28:12,777
Right here, please.

293
00:28:12,995 --> 00:28:18,429
You know, I'm noticing there
are some minor changes

294
00:28:18,638 --> 00:28:23,395
that I asked my attorney to make
that are not included in this draft.

295
00:28:23,614 --> 00:28:27,205
I'd like to go over this
with him in the morning

296
00:28:27,459 --> 00:28:33,177
and initial the changes and get
the documents to you at that time.

297
00:28:33,395 --> 00:28:38,114
If there's anything that I can do
to help you...

298
00:28:38,745 --> 00:28:42,372
with the policy,
or anything at all...

299
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:48,945
Are you an ambitious man, Mr Neff?
- One likes to think so.

300
00:28:49,489 --> 00:28:54,958
One never knows. There may be
a few "t's" left to cross.

301
00:28:56,094 --> 00:28:59,969
Goodnight.
- Mrs Martell.

302
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,400
I'll see myself out.

303
00:29:15,156 --> 00:29:16,736
Think.

304
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:20,088
Think.

305
00:29:57,534 --> 00:29:59,827
Ed, why don't you open that up?

306
00:30:01,004 --> 00:30:04,177
Wow. Look at all this.

307
00:30:05,769 --> 00:30:07,813
Well, I'm sorry.

308
00:30:08,486 --> 00:30:13,373
There's a curly-haired wig in there.
Ed, it's gonna work like gangbusters.

309
00:30:13,587 --> 00:30:16,511
I'll help you on
with one of those moustaches.

310
00:30:16,722 --> 00:30:21,645
Will it fit? I've got a big head.
- OK, give it a try.

311
00:30:22,615 --> 00:30:25,408
Testing: one, two.

312
00:30:38,877 --> 00:30:39,597
Laura.

313
00:30:41,801 --> 00:30:42,521
Laura.

314
00:31:24,571 --> 00:31:28,326
What happened?
- Somebody shot Waldo.

315
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,929
Ah, Jesus.

316
00:31:32,671 --> 00:31:34,217
Poor Waldo.

317
00:31:40,195 --> 00:31:43,988
What happened?
- Somebody shot Waldo.

318
00:31:47,554 --> 00:31:49,051
Birdie, birdie, birdie.

319
00:31:49,051 --> 00:31:53,362
Want some orange?
Come on, let's share.

320
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:58,253
Hello, Waldo.

321
00:32:04,064 --> 00:32:05,860
Laura.

322
00:32:06,071 --> 00:32:07,819
Laura.

323
00:32:08,413 --> 00:32:10,409
Don't go there.

324
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:18,937
Hurting me. Hurting me.

325
00:32:19,908 --> 00:32:23,250
Stop it! Stop it!

326
00:32:25,761 --> 00:32:27,804
Stop it!

327
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:32,484
Leo, no! Leo, no!

328
00:32:54,766 --> 00:32:56,681
Casino's probably in the back.

329
00:32:56,681 --> 00:32:59,146
If Jacques is dealing,
he'll be there.

330
00:32:59,365 --> 00:33:02,623
Well, I'll give you the high sign
and clear out.

331
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:08,058
Here comes something.
- Evening, fellas.

332
00:33:08,269 --> 00:33:11,395
They call me Blackie.
- Glad to know you.

333
00:33:11,611 --> 00:33:15,203
I like your style.
- Most do. First time here?

334
00:33:15,584 --> 00:33:19,840
Yeah, it's our rookie season.
- Tonight is spring training.

335
00:33:20,057 --> 00:33:23,516
With a little luck,
you just might make the team.

336
00:33:24,111 --> 00:33:26,192
You look like a cop.

337
00:33:26,192 --> 00:33:28,414
I'm the cop.

338
00:33:29,673 --> 00:33:33,216
You look like Cary Grant.
Got a name?

339
00:33:33,435 --> 00:33:36,976
Barney and Fred.
Just in from the Tri-Cities.

340
00:33:37,196 --> 00:33:42,118
Well, Fred, what's your line?
- Own a gas station.

341
00:33:43,007 --> 00:33:45,338
I'm an oral surgeon.

342
00:33:45,641 --> 00:33:49,863
I've got a Chevy parked out back
with a serious root canal problem.

343
00:33:50,407 --> 00:33:52,034
Wanna take a look?

344
00:33:52,034 --> 00:33:57,334
I was hoping you needed gum work.
I'd sure like a look under your hood.

345
00:33:57,334 --> 00:34:00,937
Fred's OK.
- Fred's a prince.

346
00:34:00,937 --> 00:34:04,700
So, boys, what's your pleasure?
- Cards. Dice.

347
00:34:04,913 --> 00:34:06,575
For starters.

348
00:34:06,575 --> 00:34:10,669
Casino's that way.
This might just be your lucky night.

349
00:34:10,669 --> 00:34:13,385
Luck has nothing to do with it.

350
00:34:14,693 --> 00:34:18,069
Not bad, Ed. Not bad at all.

351
00:34:28,237 --> 00:34:32,577
Hawk, we have a small casino room
with the usual games of chance.

352
00:34:32,577 --> 00:34:36,594
Bar's at the far end,
and there's stairs to who knows where.

353
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:38,804
Everybody's having a good time.

354
00:34:39,148 --> 00:34:41,645
No sign of Jacques Renault.

355
00:34:41,645 --> 00:34:46,410
Ed's gonna head to the craps table.
I'm gonna play some blackjack.

356
00:34:46,629 --> 00:34:50,137
Ed, let's gamble.

357
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:34,548
You simply have got to teach me
some of these incredible songs.

358
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:36,756
Incredible!
- Incredible.

359
00:36:36,756 --> 00:36:42,103
Jerry? Maybe you'd like to take some
of our guests down to the dining room.

360
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:48,045
I'll be with you in a half a tick!

361
00:36:50,929 --> 00:36:54,723
You should've seen them
at this tour of the site. The trees!

362
00:36:54,723 --> 00:36:56,897
Jerry.
- They worship them.

363
00:36:57,115 --> 00:36:59,959
I caught a couple of them
hugging pine.

364
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:02,746
When are they signing
the contracts?

365
00:37:02,968 --> 00:37:05,299
This needs more pecan.
They're ready.

366
00:37:05,299 --> 00:37:08,652
They're poised with their pen
in their hand.

367
00:37:10,284 --> 00:37:13,244
So, what's the catch?
- More fun.

368
00:37:13,244 --> 00:37:18,305
Signing party. They want to finalise
the deal at One-Eyed Jacks.

369
00:37:19,774 --> 00:37:22,484
How'd they find out about Jacks?

370
00:37:24,748 --> 00:37:26,661
I take full responsibility.

371
00:37:27,799 --> 00:37:32,638
Jerry, Jerry.
Get them back on the van.

372
00:37:36,453 --> 00:37:39,911
OK, everybody back in the van.

373
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:46,269
Road trip! Road trip!
- Going on a road trip! Road trip!

374
00:37:56,894 --> 00:37:59,270
Hello.
- Is she there?

375
00:38:00,739 --> 00:38:02,702
I just came back. She's gone.

376
00:38:03,457 --> 00:38:06,964
We need her at the mill.
- I'll get her there.

377
00:38:06,964 --> 00:38:10,392
Is it set for tonight?
- Yes.

378
00:38:10,604 --> 00:38:15,776
You shouldn't call for a while.
- I know the drill.

379
00:38:43,796 --> 00:38:48,383
You're not a shy one, are you?
- I'm not shy.

380
00:39:02,268 --> 00:39:04,229
Hester Prynne.

381
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:08,912
Pretty name.
Maple House in Vancouver...

382
00:39:08,912 --> 00:39:11,543
Roy's in Chicago...

383
00:39:11,758 --> 00:39:15,384
Calgary Stampede '87 through '89.

384
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:19,354
Where'd you work in Calgary?
- Around.

385
00:39:19,354 --> 00:39:21,120
Can you give me a name?

386
00:39:22,207 --> 00:39:24,169
The Lost Dude Ranch.

387
00:39:27,015 --> 00:39:29,641
Big Amos still running things
out there?

388
00:39:29,857 --> 00:39:31,902
Bigger and better.

389
00:39:35,626 --> 00:39:38,550
Big Amos is the name of my dog.

390
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:41,764
I read "The Scarlet Letter"
in high school, too.

391
00:39:41,764 --> 00:39:47,110
Give me one reason why I shouldn't
airmail you back to civilisation.

392
00:40:37,075 --> 00:40:38,988
Sign here.

393
00:40:39,459 --> 00:40:42,501
Welcome to One-Eyed Jacks, Hester.

394
00:40:47,871 --> 00:40:50,583
21 again. Another winner.

395
00:40:51,969 --> 00:40:53,429
How did you do?

396
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,694
Do I have to pay you back?
- We'll take it out of my winnings.

397
00:40:57,694 --> 00:41:00,574
Care to sit in?
- Blackjack is not my game.

398
00:41:00,574 --> 00:41:03,159
Can you count to 10?
- On a good night.

399
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,675
Then you can win at blackjack.

400
00:41:10,151 --> 00:41:12,530
Gentlemen, place your bets.

401
00:41:14,874 --> 00:41:17,918
Jacques, is it?
- That's me.

402
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:23,898
Jade, here's to old times.

403
00:41:24,573 --> 00:41:27,036
"Should old acquaintance be forgot?"

404
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:38,859
Come on, baby. Bottoms up.
One for the road. For old times' sake.

405
00:41:38,907 --> 00:41:39,627
Aloha.

406
00:41:43,809 --> 00:41:47,267
Hey, what's up, Doc?

407
00:41:47,267 --> 00:41:50,702
Feel like I'm gonna dream tonight.

408
00:41:50,702 --> 00:41:53,750
Big bad ones. You know?

409
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,214
The kind you like.

410
00:41:55,890 --> 00:42:00,361
Who is this?
- Who do you think it is, silly?

411
00:42:01,282 --> 00:42:02,743
I want to see you.

412
00:42:03,413 --> 00:42:06,421
You're not Laura.
- OK, Doc.

413
00:42:07,844 --> 00:42:11,804
First thing you have to do is
go to the door.

414
00:42:13,612 --> 00:42:15,195
Go on.

415
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:18,740
There's something waiting for you.

416
00:43:08,465 --> 00:43:10,757
That's today's paper, Doc.

417
00:43:10,757 --> 00:43:12,643
Now do you believe me?

418
00:43:13,148 --> 00:43:19,495
Meet me at Sparkwood and 21
in 10 minutes.

419
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:23,261
But wait...

420
00:43:29,491 --> 00:43:31,571
You think he bought it?

421
00:43:32,878 --> 00:43:34,708
I think so.

422
00:43:35,385 --> 00:43:37,465
I think he did.

423
00:43:38,479 --> 00:43:41,355
OK, wait here for us.

424
00:44:40,804 --> 00:44:42,137
Gazebo.

425
00:45:41,878 --> 00:45:44,840
Say goodbye, James.
