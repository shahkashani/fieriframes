1
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,774
It's clear, come on.

2
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:08,485
...six and seven...

3
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:09,778
and eight...

4
00:01:09,862 --> 00:01:12,155
and nine and ten.

5
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,241
Oly oly oxen free.

6
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,618
Caleb.

7
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,873
I'm not laughing.

8
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:24,168
Come on, y'all, where are you?

9
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,461
Sutpen's gonna get you.

10
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,715
Sutpen's gonna get you.

11
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:33,093
Sutpen's gonna get you, Boone.

12
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,974
Mama. How long
is dinner gonna be?

13
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,060
I'm thawing
the chops right now.

14
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:45,147
There's corn to think about.
Maybe a fresh garden salad.

15
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,398
How would that strike y'all?

16
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:50,152
Honey, we don't know
about all that. We just
wanna know when we'll eat.

17
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:53,447
If you'd fix the electric
so I could do more
than one thing at a time.

18
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,662
Damn those
juvenile delinquents.

19
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,251
What's going on out there?

20
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,340
Come on, kids,
I'm not gonna scold you.

21
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,800
I can hear you.
Sked!

22
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,180
We just don't want to see
anybody getting hurt.

23
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:22,351
One of these days,
I gotta take all the doors
off these old things.

24
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:26,396
Good idea, Carter. That is
about the worst thing that
could happen in this world.

25
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,315
A child trapped in an icebox.

26
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,901
Hello, Sheriff.
Yes, sir.

27
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,737
Every parent's nightmare,
losing a child.

28
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,532
What is it, Lucas?

29
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:41,537
No, it's just that
you remember when there was
that unpleasantness...

30
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,831
with Wash Sutpen's
little girl,
don't you, Carter?

31
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:49,127
Yeah, sure. How could
I forget what you done for me?

32
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,630
Glad your memory
serves you, my friend.

33
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,633
Then you haven't
forgotten about
your part of the bargain.

34
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:58,220
I guess I knew
a payback was coming.
What do I owe you, Sheriff?

35
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,347
I'm not sure.

36
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,104
Know what? I know.
I could use another
girl around the office.

37
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,941
You know, making the coffee,
doing the filing,
being my little gofer.

38
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,235
How old is your Poppy now?

39
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,821
She just turned 15 last month.

40
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,991
Darn. Child has to be
16 to be legal.

41
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,120
Then there's
Jimmy Lee Branson's daughter.
She just turned...

42
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,832
I brought a parental consent
form. And don't you worry.

43
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,837
I'll personally take her
under my wing. Now,
you take your time, Carter.

44
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,590
I won't need it till Friday.
Tomorrow?

45
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,467
I tell you what.

46
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,971
I'll give you till midnight.

47
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,185
You made a deal.
Now you gotta live by it.

48
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:41,198
How much is the rent?
$550 a month.

49
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,326
And it's got AC?
That it does.

50
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,412
Although all utilities
are not included.

51
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,540
I'll be leaving town
for a spell, so you'll be...

52
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,750
No, that's fine.
You got a deal.

53
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,530
Hello?
Hello, Gail.

54
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:24,324
Hi, Barton.
You got my message?

55
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:27,411
Yeah, and I'm not
too thrilled. I need you
back here on the city desk.

56
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,330
I know. I modemed you
that welfare piece
that I owed you...

57
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:32,499
and I'm down here.
I'm working on something.

58
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,210
You gotta cut me
some slack, okay, Barton?

59
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:37,880
Something's going on
down here.

60
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,556
No, I gotta call you back.

61
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:52,519
And what will your project be
for the science fair, Boone?

62
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,649
Me and my daddy are
gonna show how come
venison tastes best...

63
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:00,986
if you get a good clean
head shot and don't ruin it.

64
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:04,489
Caleb, would you like to
tell us about your project?

65
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:07,993
Mine's about weather.

66
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:11,163
That's a little bit vague.
What kind of weather?

67
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:15,125
Violent weather that changes
quick and destroys things.

68
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:18,212
Good. Caleb Temple: weather.

69
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,256
And remember
the rules, people.

70
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:25,135
All materials for
your project must be
common household items.

71
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,971
No buying stuff at
the hobby store.

72
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:36,563
Caleb, honey?
Ma'am?

73
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:41,485
Everyone else will be bringing
their parents with them
to the science fair...

74
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:46,156
so if you'd like to bring
someone with you, say,
Sheriff Buck, that'd be fine.

75
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:49,785
I'm sure he'd be
more than happy to help you
with your weather project.

76
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:53,205
If my daddy was still alive,
I wouldn't have any help...

77
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:56,166
and I don't need none,
now he's dead.

78
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:30,951
Hello?

79
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,372
Anybody here?
Hold on. I'm coming.

80
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:42,588
289. Nice little engine.

81
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,800
It's a bit underpowered,
to my way of thinking,
but it's nice.

82
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:50,846
My pony's fine. It's
my air conditioner
that needs work.

83
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,932
Like the sign says,
we fix anything.

84
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:57,936
It's probably the compressor
or the relay.

85
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:01,565
We'll get it so
you're freezing to death
in no time at all.

86
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,400
How much is that gonna be?

87
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,361
You're gonna have to
talk to Mr. Bowen.
He takes all the money.

88
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,780
I just do the work,
you know how it is.

89
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,329
You must be Gail Emory.

90
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:01,291
How do you know?

91
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,003
Some people match
names to faces.
I match them to the cars.

92
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,966
My Mustang?
No, this wagon.

93
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,677
I remember when it came in.

94
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,012
The boss tried to sell it
to Stevie Broadbent...

95
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:15,931
but Stevie thought
it was jinxed...

96
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,559
on account of the way
your parents passed on.

97
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:25,858
Can I talk to your boss?
I'm the boss.

98
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,279
No, no. I mean, when my
parents' car came in.

99
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:33,782
That was Wash Sutpen.
He's long gone.

100
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,159
He's dead?

101
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:37,953
He is...

102
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:40,581
He's unavailable.

103
00:09:42,1000 --> 00:09:46,253
Hey, if you're looking
for a car, I got
a really nice '78 Monaco.

104
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,337
No.

105
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:54,052
Did you deposit
the day's receipts?

106
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:55,387
What there was of it.

107
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,805
What about TJ?

108
00:09:57,723 --> 00:10:00,184
Remember to pay him?
Course I did.

109
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:02,477
"Mr. Fixit"...

110
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:05,063
will you please take
a look at this wiring?

111
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,940
Yes, sir, every
parent's nightmare.

112
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:08,108
Your part of the bargain.

113
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:10,694
How old is your Poppy?
I brought
a parental consent form.

114
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,572
I'll personally take
her under my wing.
That's midnight tomorrow.

115
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,657
Bye, Daddy. Bye, Mama.

116
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:19,411
Where do you think
you're off to?
The library, Daddy.

117
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,330
Not tonight. Not a chance.

118
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:24,666
But it's Friday night.
It's not like I'm
going out to drink beers.

119
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,210
She's got a point there,
Daddy.

120
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,504
I wouldn't say it if
there wasn't a reason.

121
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,759
We'll make it
up to you, sweetie pie.

122
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:36,386
All right.

123
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:42,476
What has gotten into you,
Carter, tonight?

124
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,645
You're as jumpy
as a toy poodle.

125
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,231
Nothing.

126
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,110
It's nothing to worry about.

127
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,743
What is that, Carter?
What?

128
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:01,745
This? Oh, it's nothing.

129
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,206
It's something
the Sheriff wants, that's all.

130
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:07,251
Sheriff Buck?
What does he want?

131
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:11,922
He offered Poppy
a job after school.

132
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:15,133
That's a news item. How come
you kept it all to yourself?

133
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:18,887
I've got my reasons.

134
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:33,861
Later, Carter.
You made a deal.

135
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:35,445
Now you gotta live by it.

136
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,364
I'll give you till midnight.

137
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:48,375
Etta?

138
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:17,863
Etta?

139
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:56,652
Etta.

140
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:57,694
Etta.

141
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,281
What are you doing down here
in the middle of the night?

142
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:04,409
Just trying to stay
ahead of things. You know how
the laundry piles up.

143
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,829
Laundry's like
death and taxes, Etta.

144
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:11,041
We sure could
use a brighter light
down here, Daddy.

145
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,759
Etta!

146
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:30,477
Hold on, Etta. I'm coming.

147
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:33,814
Need some help there, Carter?

148
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:36,191
Lucas, what are
you doing here?

149
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,904
What are friends for, Carter,
if not a bit of illumination
in times of darkness?

150
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,283
Plus, we had a deadline.
Midnight, remember?

151
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:51,707
Etta's hurt bad.

152
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,709
Not that bad, Carter.

153
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:57,629
Two hairline fractures
in her ankle, dislocated hip,
shock to the heart.

154
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,965
But Etta's got a strong heart.

155
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:01,133
We hope.

156
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:11,476
There are two hairline
fractures in the ankle here.

157
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,980
And you've dislocated
your right hip joint.

158
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:17,983
Plus a shock to the heart.
That right?

159
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:21,778
That's right.
You have a strong heart,
though, Mrs. Bowen.

160
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,906
You should be out of here
in the morning.

161
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:26,992
Damn that Buck.
I should have known.

162
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:28,911
Should have known what?

163
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,166
Nothing. Forget it.

164
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,129
You're saying
the Sheriff did this?

165
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:44,259
I don't know. But he's always
there when trouble starts.

166
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,970
Sounds like a mutiny.

167
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:50,766
You won't find no
mutiny here, Sheriff.

168
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,352
Not after all you've
done for Carter.

169
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,978
What do you want?

170
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:57,856
Just paying
a courtesy call, Harvard.

171
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,150
I don't suppose they
taught you that up north.

172
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:03,487
Then do Mrs. Bowen a courtesy.
Make it brief.

173
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:06,240
Carter.

174
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:25,384
I just want to say I'm sorry
about all this, Lucas.

175
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:29,221
Me, too, Carter. I was
kind of surprised when
you didn't make that deadline.

176
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:32,641
Look, let's forget
about Poppy.

177
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,727
I understand.

178
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,563
I've got something else
for you now.

179
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:39,731
Anything, Lucas.
Just tell me.

180
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:41,900
I got this friend of mine
coming in tomorrow...

181
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:43,944
on the 5:42 out of Columbia...

182
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:46,405
and I was hoping
you could pick him up for me.

183
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:49,449
I got this Chamber
of Commerce meeting...
That's it?

184
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:52,786
Why didn't you say so?
Heck, I'd be glad to
do it for you, Lucas.

185
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:56,373
And I knew I could
count on you, Carter. You just
tote him back to your place...

186
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,750
and I'll swing by and get him
when I get a chance, okay?

187
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:01,628
You bet you, Lucas.
It's a done deal.

188
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,810
Hi, Caleb.

189
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:26,278
What are you trying to do?

190
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,406
Make a tornado, but this
dang thing ain't worth a dang.

191
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,075
I got a book on tornadoes and
freak storms you can borrow.

192
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,120
I don't want a book.
I want a project that works.

193
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:38,498
Boy's right. Any sissy
can do a book report.

194
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:40,751
You spying on me?

195
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,921
Heck, no, that ain't my style.

196
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:46,131
What's the trouble, bub?

197
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:51,845
I'm trying to make a tornado
chamber, but it looks like
I ain't getting very far.

198
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:55,307
It's a sorry tornado
that comes out of a blender...

199
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:58,644
unless you're making good old
Doc Crower a frozen daiquiri.

200
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:00,771
A what?
Never mind.

201
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:05,776
Tell you what, get
a sheet of plexiglas,
big bunch of dry ice...

202
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:10,113
and one of them
one-horse motors. Then you
got yourself a tornado.

203
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:14,284
That's fine, Caleb, but you
need to know why things are...

204
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:16,370
what makes them work.

205
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,458
It's not as much fun,
but it's what separates
the men from the boys.

206
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:26,588
You need that book,
you just holler.

207
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,340
All right.

208
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:38,517
Here, son. You go out and
buy yourself what you need.

209
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:42,479
I can't.
It's against the rules.

210
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:46,316
Against the rules for
a fellow to help a boy
with his homework?

211
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:51,530
I'm gonna have to have
a little talk with Ms. Coombs.

212
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:54,867
Look out.

213
00:18:58,472 --> 00:18:59,848
Mommy.

214
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:05,437
Honey, take this.
Quick, hide it.

215
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:12,152
Mommy, is everything okay?

216
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:16,615
Where's the fire, Ms. Emory?

217
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:20,661
Ms. Emory?

218
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:49,565
Ms. Emory?

219
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,402
Are you following
me around, ma'am?
Yeah, right.

220
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:56,196
No, really, I come out here
on a 6-13 and here you are.

221
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,949
Now, maybe I'm paranoid,
but I think that
you're watching me.

222
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:01,451
I think you're
flattering yourself.

223
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:05,330
So, what's a 6-13?
Report of an intruder,
stealing stuff.

224
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:07,708
I didn't steal anything.
Did I say you did?

225
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:12,504
Although the junkyard
is closed, so technically,
you are intruding.

226
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:19,011
Look at that. They match your
fair complexion perfectly.

227
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:21,763
Thanks. They make me sneeze.

228
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:23,390
They're not for you, anyhow.

229
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:25,976
Poor Carter Bowen's wife
got quite a shock.

230
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,312
I'm sure
she'll appreciate them.

231
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:31,023
Are you hiding something?
No.

232
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:35,694
Come on, now, Ms. Emory.
There's no perjury out here.

233
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:41,033
What could I possibly
be hiding from you?
Your true feelings, perhaps?

234
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:11,647
Who is that, Daddy?

235
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:24,117
Wash Sutpen. A man I knew
a long time ago.

236
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:28,997
You mean, "Sutpen
the junkman, something
in his head"? That one?

237
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:31,959
I'll be damned.

238
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:54,940
Wash, we weren't
expecting seeing you
until 1999 or so.

239
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:58,151
Sheriff Buck pulled
a few strings. Here I am.

240
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:02,364
Damn, you look the same.
You truly do.

241
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,449
How'd you do it?

242
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:07,286
Prison food, Carter.
And a clear conscience.

243
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:12,124
Now you, on the other hand...
The cares of family life,
you know how it is.

244
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:13,542
Yeah, I remember.

245
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:19,173
Is that little Poppy?

246
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:26,930
This is Wash Sutpen,
my old boss.

247
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:30,434
Something I made for you
on the inside.

248
00:22:31,143 --> 00:22:35,105
My, I had no idea
so much time had passed.

249
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:37,357
Really? It's for me?

250
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:50,454
Say thank you, Poppy.
Thank you.

251
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:53,832
It's a little young for you,
but like I said...

252
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,668
time goes by
a lot faster out here.

253
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,545
We gotta get going.

254
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:01,673
Remember, your
mama's laid up at home.

255
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:04,176
Good to see you out, Wash.

256
00:23:04,218 --> 00:23:08,222
Good, Carter? It's a good
deal better than that.
It's called living.

257
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:32,996
Why won't you tell me
who's coming for supper?

258
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:37,042
Now, Etta, the point of
a surprise is surprise.

259
00:23:37,543 --> 00:23:40,087
I don't want you to think
I'm not grateful.

260
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:43,966
Those flowers are
so beautiful they just
brighten up the whole house.

261
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:45,634
You hear that, TJ?

262
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:48,470
Maybe someday
you'll have a house like this.

263
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:51,348
Maybe Carter will give it
to you as a wedding present.

264
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,683
Yeah, when pigs fly.

265
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,063
Hi, Mama.

266
00:24:01,233 --> 00:24:04,111
Lucas Buck,
is that Wash Sutpen?

267
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:07,823
Hasn't aged a day, has he?
Don't know how he does it.

268
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,537
I don't want that man
in my house.

269
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:17,291
Now, that's hardly
taking an enlightened
view of rehabilitation.

270
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:21,670
I promised Lucas.
It's just for supper.

271
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:24,464
Carter, I am not
happy about this.

272
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:30,512
If you say he's okay,
then he's okay.

273
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:32,890
He won't be with you
more than a couple of days...

274
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:34,933
until I get him settled
over in Goat Town.

275
00:24:35,017 --> 00:24:37,603
You didn't say nothing
about him staying.

276
00:24:37,728 --> 00:24:41,106
I'm sorry, Carter. Is someone
using your extra room?

277
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:42,649
Well, no.

278
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:44,610
All right, then.
Another problem solved.

279
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:47,446
With Etta laid up,
you can probably use
the extra help anyway.

280
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:49,781
Wash Sutpen
ain't no freeloader.

281
00:24:49,907 --> 00:24:52,701
You know, it's my job to keep
an eye on parolees in Trinity.

282
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:55,245
So let's enjoy ourselves
while we're at it.

283
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:59,625
There's baby backs with
all the fixings and a bucket
of frosties in the kitchen.

284
00:25:04,755 --> 00:25:07,424
You just set right there
and let me get it for you.

285
00:25:07,466 --> 00:25:10,177
I can get it myself,
or my husband can.

286
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:12,638
Let me earn my keep.

287
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:16,934
It's been 17 years since
I've had the privilege
of waiting on a lady.

288
00:25:20,229 --> 00:25:22,940
For me, I would like
a little something.

289
00:25:23,315 --> 00:25:26,985
A plate with
all the fixings and
an icy cold beer coming up.

290
00:25:27,361 --> 00:25:28,987
Thank you kindly.

291
00:25:29,238 --> 00:25:32,282
But hold the beer.
I'm on Darvon.

292
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:47,548
Can I ask a question?

293
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:50,926
Go right ahead.

294
00:25:52,261 --> 00:25:53,804
What's it like to kill a man?

295
00:25:57,683 --> 00:26:00,435
Poppy, he don't
wanna talk about that.

296
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:08,235
Voilá.

297
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:12,489
It's the pig picking cake
old Mrs. Eanes used to make.
She's dead, you know.

298
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:14,533
Sure ain't nothing like
pig picking cake.

299
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:17,870
I don't mind talking about it,
ma'am. It's a fair question.

300
00:26:18,787 --> 00:26:22,457
Didn't feel good or bad. I was
merely protecting my family.

301
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:24,042
Against who?

302
00:26:26,128 --> 00:26:28,589
Fellow who was taking
liberties with my daughter.

303
00:26:30,174 --> 00:26:32,551
Turned out it was
the wrong man, though.

304
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:36,263
She was smart and pretty,
just like you.

305
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:38,932
Carter sure thought so.

306
00:26:40,726 --> 00:26:42,186
No, I didn't.

307
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:46,732
Your daddy used to work for
Mr. Sutpen right about the
time all this was happening.

308
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:51,278
Before he met your mama
he had something
of a crush on that...

309
00:26:52,905 --> 00:26:56,158
Anyway, everybody
deserves a second chance.

310
00:26:58,202 --> 00:27:01,079
That's right. Everybody
deserves a second chance.

311
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:03,540
So what happened next?

312
00:27:05,584 --> 00:27:09,254
I lost everything.
My wife, my business...

313
00:27:10,506 --> 00:27:12,090
and my daughter.

314
00:27:16,345 --> 00:27:18,305
Who'd like some whipped cream?

315
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:27,814
Hey!

316
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:31,902
You're just in time.

317
00:27:31,944 --> 00:27:35,113
Am I? Maybe I'm too late.

318
00:27:35,781 --> 00:27:39,201
What are you talking about?
I'm just getting it going.

319
00:27:39,368 --> 00:27:41,495
You're going the wrong way.

320
00:27:42,955 --> 00:27:45,082
It's just a science project.

321
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:50,087
Five, four, three...

322
00:27:50,921 --> 00:27:54,174
two, one. Stand back.

323
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,260
Caleb.

324
00:27:56,844 --> 00:27:58,387
Tornado time.

325
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:01,598
Dang! Would you
look at that, Merly?

326
00:28:31,795 --> 00:28:33,922
That little toy
is growing on you.

327
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:43,432
I was just thinking.
About what?

328
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:47,477
About you, protecting
your family like that.

329
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:49,605
That was heroic.

330
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:54,318
Too bad I shot
the wrong man, but well...

331
00:28:55,444 --> 00:28:58,488
Did you find the secret yet?
There's a secret?

332
00:28:59,198 --> 00:29:00,324
Yeah.

333
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:05,621
Come, sit here.

334
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:17,549
Where's the secret?

335
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:20,469
I'll show you.

336
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,655
You smell nice.

337
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,414
You didn't tell me
what it's for...

338
00:29:49,915 --> 00:29:51,750
the little compartment.

339
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:54,753
You already know
what it's for.

340
00:29:56,964 --> 00:29:58,924
I'm gonna go to bed now.

341
00:30:17,276 --> 00:30:20,279
The secret to crabbing
is to be real gentle.

342
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:24,157
That's what my granddaddy used
to say. He was a professional.

343
00:30:24,408 --> 00:30:26,910
Professional what?
Crabber.

344
00:30:27,286 --> 00:30:29,955
What about your daddy?
Was he a crabber?

345
00:30:30,247 --> 00:30:33,458
No. He was a newspaperman.

346
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:37,379
I'd rather go crabbing
than deliver the papers.

347
00:30:38,922 --> 00:30:42,801
He was an editor, and my mom
was his editor-in-chief.

348
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,764
They worked hand in hand
until the day they died.

349
00:30:48,348 --> 00:30:49,892
How'd they die?

350
00:30:51,143 --> 00:30:53,562
There was a fire
in the printing room.

351
00:30:53,812 --> 00:30:55,564
Was it an accident?

352
00:30:56,565 --> 00:30:59,568
I don't know. I'm not sure.

353
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,907
You know, maybe someday
you could help me find out.

354
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:06,742
Why me?

355
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,120
Because you're my cousin.

356
00:31:12,831 --> 00:31:15,918
Because you know how to
ask all those tough questions.

357
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:19,213
Maybe someday I'll be
a newspaper reporter.

358
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:22,090
Maybe you will.

359
00:31:23,008 --> 00:31:24,468
Hey. Hey.

360
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:26,136
You got one.

361
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,309
Oh, he's a nice one. Good job.
Well, thank you.

362
00:31:50,202 --> 00:31:51,870
Hello, Mr. Sutpen.

363
00:31:52,955 --> 00:31:55,791
Brought you something,
being as it's so hot.

364
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:57,125
Thank you.

365
00:32:04,842 --> 00:32:08,428
I've always liked these
better than those ones
that you gotta push up...

366
00:32:08,512 --> 00:32:10,639
and the paper gets all sticky.

367
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:13,392
My friend Lois,
she likes the ice...

368
00:32:14,977 --> 00:32:18,397
You'll feel the breeze on your
skin better if you're still.

369
00:32:20,232 --> 00:32:21,441
Really?

370
00:32:24,528 --> 00:32:27,155
That way you feel
the completeness of it all.

371
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:32,786
The cool wind
blowing over your body.

372
00:32:34,705 --> 00:32:36,915
The sound of a wind chime...

373
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:41,128
tinkling from far away.

374
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:45,090
Close your eyes.

375
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:53,891
Now open your mouth
just a little bit.

376
00:32:58,103 --> 00:33:02,524
Keep your eyes closed, because
this is the best of all.

377
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:21,043
That's nice.

378
00:33:30,969 --> 00:33:32,346
Hey, Carter.

379
00:33:33,805 --> 00:33:36,225
I'm gonna go see
if Mama needs anything.

380
00:34:07,631 --> 00:34:10,509
You want some lunch?
No.

381
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,804
Where'd that come from?

382
00:34:15,514 --> 00:34:18,350
Sheriff helped me.
I see.

383
00:34:20,352 --> 00:34:23,480
It's very impressive.
Yeah, it is.

384
00:34:24,356 --> 00:34:26,775
Did you get that book
that I left you?

385
00:34:28,944 --> 00:34:30,863
"Bernoulli's Principle. "

386
00:34:33,156 --> 00:34:36,535
Even if I did read
this thing to the
beginning to the end...

387
00:34:36,618 --> 00:34:39,830
I still couldn't have
made that thing.
Maybe not.

388
00:34:40,205 --> 00:34:42,666
But at least you'd understand
why it works.

389
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:45,419
That man spent his entire life
trying to explain things...

390
00:34:45,502 --> 00:34:47,838
that couldn't be
explained, Caleb.

391
00:34:47,963 --> 00:34:52,009
I'm sure it wasn't easy. But
nothing worthwhile ever is.

392
00:34:54,261 --> 00:34:56,305
Maybe I'll take a look at it.

393
00:34:57,055 --> 00:34:58,515
Couldn't hurt.

394
00:35:01,894 --> 00:35:04,855
And then maybe you could
explain some of that to me.

395
00:36:10,546 --> 00:36:13,423
Got you now, girl.
Oh, you scared me to death.

396
00:36:13,632 --> 00:36:15,092
I'm sorry.

397
00:36:21,974 --> 00:36:24,309
What are you two
doing down there?

398
00:36:25,978 --> 00:36:27,437
Nothing, Daddy.

399
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:36,530
You go on in the house.
You get on back to the house.

400
00:36:39,408 --> 00:36:40,701
Go on!

401
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:44,288
We were just swimming.
Yeah, you was just swimming.

402
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:49,501
We were just swimming.

403
00:37:05,017 --> 00:37:07,686
Damn. This is a fish stick.

404
00:37:08,562 --> 00:37:10,272
How you been, Carter?

405
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:11,982
Not very well, Lucas.

406
00:37:12,858 --> 00:37:16,486
It's Sutpen. He's been
worrying little Poppy.

407
00:37:17,321 --> 00:37:21,241
Well, she is a healthy-looking
girl. Probably got a lot
of time on her hands, too.

408
00:37:21,325 --> 00:37:24,828
She's only 15.
Sit down, Carter.
Order the fish sticks.

409
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,458
Excuse me.

410
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:32,836
Sheriff...

411
00:37:33,212 --> 00:37:36,340
the thing is, I come upon
them swimming.

412
00:37:37,132 --> 00:37:38,634
I want him gone.

413
00:37:39,092 --> 00:37:42,429
You can't arrest a man for
swimming, not even in Trinity.

414
00:37:42,513 --> 00:37:44,473
But, Lucas...
But nothing.

415
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:47,726
I offered my help,
you rejected it.

416
00:37:47,768 --> 00:37:51,188
I wanted to take Poppy under
my wing, you wouldn't have it.

417
00:37:52,022 --> 00:37:55,150
I guess it's time for a father
to do what he's gotta do.

418
00:37:56,568 --> 00:37:58,070
Wouldn't you say?

419
00:38:01,573 --> 00:38:03,784
That was very
informative, Boone.

420
00:38:05,577 --> 00:38:07,204
Caleb, you ready?

421
00:38:10,374 --> 00:38:12,626
This here is
a tornado chamber.

422
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:15,337
It's gonna show you
how a funnel cloud forms.

423
00:38:22,386 --> 00:38:23,387
See?

424
00:38:29,393 --> 00:38:32,646
He's a real corker,
isn't he? Put that
together all by himself.

425
00:38:41,613 --> 00:38:43,198
This ain't right.

426
00:38:43,574 --> 00:38:46,869
Sure it is, boy.
You're doing fine.
No, sir.

427
00:38:48,203 --> 00:38:51,957
Ms. Coombs? I bought this
here tornado chamber.

428
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:56,128
And I'm disqualifying myself
from the science fair.

429
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,630
She said
you couldn't do that.

430
00:38:58,714 --> 00:39:01,633
Well, I'm surprised at you,
Caleb Temple.

431
00:39:02,342 --> 00:39:04,678
Whatever possessed you
to cheat?

432
00:39:07,806 --> 00:39:09,433
Caleb, forget about
the equipment.

433
00:39:09,474 --> 00:39:10,809
That's not important.

434
00:39:10,851 --> 00:39:13,312
Tell them about
Bernoulli's principle.

435
00:39:13,478 --> 00:39:15,439
Who the heck is Bernoulli?

436
00:39:15,772 --> 00:39:20,652
Bernoulli's principle says
the inside of a tornado
has very low air pressure.

437
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,865
The pressure is
differential is what
causes all the damage.

438
00:39:25,532 --> 00:39:29,077
Weather can be determined
by analyzing
the barometric change...

439
00:39:29,161 --> 00:39:30,913
as the temperature drops.

440
00:39:30,996 --> 00:39:33,916
So open your windows when
there's a tornado warning...

441
00:39:33,999 --> 00:39:37,085
or your house could explode
from inside and out.

442
00:40:38,897 --> 00:40:40,649
What the hell
are you doing up?

443
00:40:40,732 --> 00:40:42,693
Can't sleep. You?

444
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:47,447
I'd sleep fine if you'd
just get the hell back
where you came from.

445
00:40:47,906 --> 00:40:51,118
I ain't going back there,
Carter. I done my time.

446
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:56,456
You touch that little
girl again, you gonna wish
you was back in solitary.

447
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:00,878
You better get
some rest, friend.

448
00:41:01,086 --> 00:41:02,963
You're coming unglued.

449
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:08,760
Are you ever coming to bed?

450
00:41:10,429 --> 00:41:11,972
Not tonight, I ain't.

451
00:41:18,353 --> 00:41:19,521
Caleb.

452
00:41:22,191 --> 00:41:25,861
You did real good.
I'm proud of you.

453
00:41:27,738 --> 00:41:29,573
We're all proud of you.

454
00:41:29,615 --> 00:41:32,117
You was there? And Mama?

455
00:41:32,576 --> 00:41:34,536
We were all there, Caleb.

456
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:37,748
I knew it.
I could feel it, Merlyn.

457
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:40,375
I was happy.

458
00:42:32,344 --> 00:42:33,804
Poppy?

459
00:42:33,846 --> 00:42:35,430
Poppy!

460
00:42:35,514 --> 00:42:37,140
Poppy, open up in there!

461
00:42:37,182 --> 00:42:38,475
Poppy!

462
00:43:08,672 --> 00:43:09,923
Etta?

463
00:43:15,721 --> 00:43:17,306
Etta.

464
00:43:19,224 --> 00:43:20,642
Etta!

465
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,783
I just can't get my head
around what's happened.

466
00:44:17,866 --> 00:44:20,536
Poor old Mr. Bowen.
I know, son.

467
00:44:21,537 --> 00:44:25,082
It's probably time
you started thinking about
moving up in the world.

468
00:44:25,165 --> 00:44:26,667
I can't stay here.

469
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:29,378
That's where you're wrong.
Trinity needs things repaired.

470
00:44:29,461 --> 00:44:32,923
Hell, we need a "Mr. Fixit."
You could start
your own business.

471
00:44:33,257 --> 00:44:34,925
I ain't got
that kind of money.

472
00:44:35,008 --> 00:44:37,511
Now, a low interest loan
could be arranged...

473
00:44:37,594 --> 00:44:41,181
particularly if something came
on the market at a good price.

474
00:45:01,743 --> 00:45:04,454
I always wanted to own
my own business.

475
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:07,999
That's the spirit.

476
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:12,713
Down the road,
maybe I'll ask you
for a small favor.
