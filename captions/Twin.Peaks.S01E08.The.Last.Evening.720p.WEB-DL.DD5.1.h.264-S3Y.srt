1
00:02:22,923 --> 00:02:27,146
Where do we look?
- I don't know. Everywhere.

2
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:29,436
Where shall we start?

3
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:39,436
Maybe this is something.

4
00:02:43,623 --> 00:02:45,502
Umbrellas?

5
00:02:48,432 --> 00:02:52,772
"The Kahala Hilton, July 1969,
men on the moon..."

6
00:02:54,076 --> 00:02:57,334
"August 9th, 197 4,"

7
00:02:57,334 --> 00:03:00,217
"I first lay eyes on Mimsy."

8
00:03:00,217 --> 00:03:02,888
Weird!
- Yeah.

9
00:03:23,097 --> 00:03:25,774
James!
- What d'you do?

10
00:03:25,774 --> 00:03:29,616
I just hit a button.
- Hit it again.

11
00:03:33,928 --> 00:03:37,140
There's gotta be
a way to turn it off.

12
00:03:41,414 --> 00:03:44,090
My little coconut.

13
00:03:45,344 --> 00:03:46,546
James!

14
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:54,250
Laura said something
on her tape about a coconut.

15
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,875
Oh, my God, the necklace!

16
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,544
OK, Laura...

17
00:04:20,544 --> 00:04:23,398
this is where you shot that video.

18
00:04:25,405 --> 00:04:27,117
Now just tell me...

19
00:04:27,117 --> 00:04:30,706
Tell me why you sent me
to Sparkwood and 21?

20
00:04:37,825 --> 00:04:39,621
Oh, my God!

21
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:15,458
No!

22
00:05:46,544 --> 00:05:50,087
Red, 36.
- Sorry, I guess our date's off.

23
00:05:50,087 --> 00:05:53,267
77.
- Pay red.

24
00:05:53,267 --> 00:05:55,357
No, let it ride.

25
00:05:55,357 --> 00:05:57,412
Excuse me, can I get...?

26
00:05:59,966 --> 00:06:03,225
Sir, are you absolutely sure
you want another card?

27
00:06:03,225 --> 00:06:05,186
Yes, please.

28
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,767
Twenty-one! Can you beat that?

29
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:22,460
Mother always said I was born lucky.

30
00:06:33,838 --> 00:06:35,467
Maybe later.

31
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:38,351
Thanks for asking.

32
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:46,592
This is for you.

33
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,198
I'm a friend of Leo's.

34
00:06:56,127 --> 00:06:58,041
Who's Leo?

35
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:01,346
Buy you a cocktail, Jacques?

36
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:18,871
Come in.

37
00:07:26,492 --> 00:07:27,775
Turn around.

38
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:32,465
Yes...

39
00:07:32,465 --> 00:07:35,981
Very nice.
Come over here.

40
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:49,525
Something wrong?
- Uh-uh.

41
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,963
This is a good night
for you to break in.

42
00:07:53,963 --> 00:07:57,926
The owner's coming by, he likes
to spend time with the new girls.

43
00:07:58,606 --> 00:08:01,532
Who's that?
- No names, child.

44
00:08:01,532 --> 00:08:04,669
You don't offer, and you don't ask.

45
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:06,210
Yes, ma'am.

46
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:13,112
Pick a card.

47
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:33,890
How long you been dealing Blackjack?
- Long enough to spot a card counter.

48
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,025
You let card counters
buy you a drink?

49
00:08:36,025 --> 00:08:38,699
I don't see tips like that everyday.

50
00:08:38,699 --> 00:08:43,967
Leo ever mention me to you?
- I don't know, Mr. Who are you?

51
00:08:43,967 --> 00:08:47,155
I can't believe
Leo never told you about me.

52
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:52,883
Maybe he did, I don't know.
- Leo played you like a violin.

53
00:08:52,883 --> 00:08:57,858
He had you taking all the risk and
never cut you a piece of the action.

54
00:08:57,858 --> 00:09:00,526
I don't know
what you're talking about.

55
00:09:00,526 --> 00:09:04,845
Take that chip out of your pocket
and take a look. Go ahead.

56
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:07,384
That chip has a special significance.

57
00:09:07,384 --> 00:09:10,692
A very special night
you spent up at your cabin.

58
00:09:10,692 --> 00:09:12,787
Here's a clue.

59
00:09:12,787 --> 00:09:15,502
"Laura! Laura!"

60
00:09:15,502 --> 00:09:18,893
Come on, take it easy.
Take it easy!

61
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:22,863
How do you think a low-rent hump
like Leo has been financing this?

62
00:09:23,915 --> 00:09:25,544
You...

63
00:09:25,544 --> 00:09:27,920
I'm the bank.

64
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,350
He never mentioned your name.
- Course not.

65
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,820
Leo buys with my cash,
and you mule it across the border.

66
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,500
He tell you who's distributing Stateside?
- No.

67
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,260
Some high school kid...
- That's right.

68
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,732
We're in sync now, Jacques,
can you feel it? Can you?

69
00:09:44,732 --> 00:09:48,120
Yeah, yeah, sure.
- Good.

70
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,256
'Cause I've got a job for you tonight.

71
00:09:51,256 --> 00:09:54,606
No Leo. No middleman.

72
00:09:56,616 --> 00:10:00,327
It's ten grand.
Half now, half on completion.

73
00:10:00,327 --> 00:10:03,218
How's that sound?

74
00:10:03,892 --> 00:10:06,057
Sounds good.

75
00:10:06,945 --> 00:10:08,527
What are we doing?

76
00:10:08,994 --> 00:10:12,123
Meet me at the plant
on Black Lake in two hours.

77
00:10:12,123 --> 00:10:15,634
Is that going to be a problem?
- No. No problem.

78
00:10:15,634 --> 00:10:17,773
Good.

79
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:24,924
One more question, Jacques.

80
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:30,065
Leo told me all about that night
at the cabin with the girls.

81
00:10:30,065 --> 00:10:33,408
I'm curious about the chip.
How'd that happen?

82
00:10:35,256 --> 00:10:39,263
It was that crazy bird.
- Bird?

83
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:42,898
It had a thing for Laura,
saying her name all the time,

84
00:10:42,898 --> 00:10:45,537
like he's in love or something.

85
00:10:45,537 --> 00:10:47,630
So we're all partying.

86
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,380
The girls are getting high,
everybody's crazy...

87
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:54,360
You, Laura and Ronnette.
- Leo lets Waldo out of the cage...

88
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,951
The birdie lands on her shoulder.

89
00:10:57,951 --> 00:11:01,923
Laura's all tied up.
Oh, she liked that.

90
00:11:01,923 --> 00:11:06,020
The birdy starts pecking
on her shoulder, like love pecks.

91
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,702
Know what I mean? So Leo...

92
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:14,347
he's doing a number on her, and
she's screaming about that damn bird.

93
00:11:14,347 --> 00:11:17,733
So Leo takes out a chip,

94
00:11:17,733 --> 00:11:21,327
puts it in her mouth and says,

95
00:11:22,342 --> 00:11:25,304
"Bite the bullet, baby."

96
00:11:25,304 --> 00:11:27,767
"Bite the bullet."

97
00:11:32,043 --> 00:11:35,218
Thanks for clearing that up.

98
00:11:35,218 --> 00:11:36,804
Yeah, no problem.

99
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:41,988
See you on the other side.
- Can do, Cappy.

100
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,522
Got a trout on the line, Hawk.

101
00:11:52,366 --> 00:11:54,698
This one's a keeper.

102
00:11:59,191 --> 00:12:03,366
I'm just gonna sit here, OK?
- Come here, sweetie.

103
00:12:03,366 --> 00:12:05,912
Look, we got all night, baby!

104
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:10,517
Aren't you...?

105
00:12:10,517 --> 00:12:13,403
Yeah. I'm just gonna put this...

106
00:12:21,898 --> 00:12:23,230
Yes...

107
00:13:01,968 --> 00:13:04,347
You made me do this, Shelly.

108
00:13:04,347 --> 00:13:05,934
You made me!

109
00:13:14,347 --> 00:13:16,808
Is Lucy talking to you yet?

110
00:13:16,808 --> 00:13:21,869
As we say in the law enforcement
game, "It's a cold trail."

111
00:13:23,672 --> 00:13:25,920
Ah, women!

112
00:13:28,647 --> 00:13:33,120
Harry? Hawk here. The trout's
heading upstream towards the net.

113
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,881
Hawk, hold the line.
We'll set the hook.

114
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:40,561
You got a 20 on Agent Cooper?
- He's downstream ten minutes.

115
00:13:40,561 --> 00:13:44,782
He'll probably miss the catch,
but he'll be there when we grill him.

116
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:49,965
Copy that. We'll make our move as
soon as the big fish shows his fins.

117
00:13:51,271 --> 00:13:52,519
Ready, Andy?

118
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:54,571
Ready, Harry.

119
00:14:07,538 --> 00:14:10,035
Keep your hands
where I can see them!

120
00:14:10,035 --> 00:14:13,508
Put them on the roof of the car!
- You heard him!

121
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,609
Get in there and cuff him.

122
00:14:16,609 --> 00:14:18,028
Don't move!

123
00:14:18,028 --> 00:14:22,215
You're under arrest for the attempted
murder of Ronnette Pulaski

124
00:14:22,884 --> 00:14:25,263
and the murder of Laura Palmer.

125
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,895
Give me your other hand.

126
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,711
He's got my gun!
- Harry, look out!

127
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,224
Andy...?

128
00:14:38,224 --> 00:14:41,408
Are you OK, Harry?
- Yeah.

129
00:14:41,944 --> 00:14:46,333
Better call that ambulance.
- Yeah.

130
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:50,135
...held against you in a court of law,
you have a right to an attorney...

131
00:14:54,364 --> 00:14:55,611
Hello?

132
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,081
All clear.

133
00:14:59,081 --> 00:15:01,884
I'll be there as soon as I can.

134
00:15:07,201 --> 00:15:09,663
Hey, what's up, Doc?

135
00:15:09,663 --> 00:15:12,416
It's Laura,
in case you haven't guessed.

136
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:17,317
It's Thursday 23rd, and I'm so bored.

137
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:22,085
Actually, I'm in kind of a weird mood.

138
00:15:22,085 --> 00:15:25,472
God, James is sweet,
but he's so dumb.

139
00:15:25,472 --> 00:15:30,151
And right now I can only take
so much of sweet!

140
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:37,637
Hey, remember that
mystery man I told you about?

141
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:43,947
Well, if I tell you his name,
then you're going to be in trouble.

142
00:15:43,947 --> 00:15:50,013
He wouldn't be a mystery man anymore,
but you might be history, man!

143
00:15:50,013 --> 00:15:54,487
I think a couple of times
he's tried to kill me.

144
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:56,751
But guess what?

145
00:15:56,751 --> 00:16:00,882
As you know, I sure got off on it.

146
00:16:03,194 --> 00:16:05,525
Isn't sex weird?

147
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:12,174
This guy can really light
my F-l-R-E.

148
00:16:13,062 --> 00:16:15,906
As in red Corvette.

149
00:16:17,747 --> 00:16:19,375
Uh-oh!

150
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,677
Here comes Mom
with milk and cookies.

151
00:16:22,677 --> 00:16:24,929
Donna?
- Dad!

152
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,734
Bye-bye.

153
00:16:28,619 --> 00:16:31,462
I've got an emergency
at the hospital.

154
00:16:31,462 --> 00:16:35,257
See if your mother needs anything.
I'll call later.

155
00:16:38,196 --> 00:16:39,943
James...

156
00:16:39,943 --> 00:16:43,628
It's OK, I'm glad I heard her say it.
I'm glad.

157
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:46,379
I might have gone my whole life...

158
00:16:47,603 --> 00:16:50,815
I'm sorry you had to hear that.
- I'm OK.

159
00:16:50,815 --> 00:16:54,786
Jacoby didn't kill her.
He was trying to help her.

160
00:16:54,786 --> 00:16:57,176
Then how did he get the necklace?

161
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,163
Do you hear that?

162
00:17:54,184 --> 00:17:58,323
You've got one hour to think
about what you've done to me.

163
00:17:58,323 --> 00:18:01,286
And think about it!

164
00:18:01,286 --> 00:18:05,469
'Cause by then
Bobby Briggs is gonna be dead!

165
00:18:10,032 --> 00:18:12,613
You broke my heart!

166
00:19:13,554 --> 00:19:15,847
Goodbye.

167
00:19:22,481 --> 00:19:24,728
It's all here.

168
00:19:24,728 --> 00:19:26,869
Very generous, Josie.

169
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:30,922
Sitting in that concrete box
all that time,

170
00:19:30,922 --> 00:19:35,228
90 grand seemed like
all the money in creation.

171
00:19:35,228 --> 00:19:37,365
It kept me going.

172
00:19:38,957 --> 00:19:41,799
It's a funny thing.

173
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:44,929
Back in the world...I don't know...

174
00:19:46,358 --> 00:19:49,070
...it seems kind of light.

175
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:53,752
We had an agreement.

176
00:19:56,729 --> 00:20:00,522
I've been going over this
in my mind and...

177
00:20:00,522 --> 00:20:03,413
If you could follow my thinking...

178
00:20:03,413 --> 00:20:05,631
We're all born into life,

179
00:20:05,631 --> 00:20:11,191
we have a certain number of years
to breathe and have our being.

180
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:16,591
That's from a book on Oriental
philosophy I read in the joint.

181
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:21,599
Maybe somebody, somewhere,
knows how much time we have.

182
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:24,322
I don't. Do you?

183
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:31,221
So, when a man gives up a portion
of his life, 18 months for instance,

184
00:20:31,221 --> 00:20:34,730
how does he place a value on that time?

185
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:38,452
18 months...90,000...

186
00:20:38,452 --> 00:20:41,762
What's that? 5,000 a month?

187
00:20:41,762 --> 00:20:46,690
Not bad if you live another 50 years,
but what if you've only another 20?

188
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:48,830
Or ten?

189
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:52,675
Or some unforeseen event
kills you tomorrow?

190
00:20:52,675 --> 00:20:58,104
Like the boating accident
that killed your late husband, Andrew.

191
00:21:02,214 --> 00:21:05,426
Or say you just got out of prison,

192
00:21:05,426 --> 00:21:10,614
where you went in
for vehicular manslaughter,

193
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:16,591
as part of an agreement to avoid
being implicated in a greater crime,

194
00:21:16,591 --> 00:21:18,514
murder,

195
00:21:18,514 --> 00:21:21,775
for which, in fact,
you were responsible.

196
00:21:21,775 --> 00:21:25,169
But nowthere's this threat,
this possible threat,

197
00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:28,847
that this fact could be discovered.

198
00:21:28,847 --> 00:21:32,189
And in one stroke,
10, 15 or 20 more years of your life

199
00:21:32,189 --> 00:21:34,862
could be cut right out
from underneath you.

200
00:21:34,862 --> 00:21:37,966
So I've been asking myself,

201
00:21:37,966 --> 00:21:43,225
what does that do to the market
value of 18 months?

202
00:21:46,122 --> 00:21:48,454
We had an agreement.

203
00:21:50,095 --> 00:21:52,807
And we still do, sweetheart.

204
00:21:52,807 --> 00:21:55,400
Signed, sealed, delivered.

205
00:21:56,158 --> 00:21:59,702
And I want to take care
of everything we agreed to.

206
00:21:59,702 --> 00:22:05,019
You want a lot for your money,
and I want a lot for my time.

207
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:09,452
There's a saying in the joint.

208
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:12,337
It's not oriental philosophy,

209
00:22:12,337 --> 00:22:18,437
but it has a similar logic that
appeals to my... spiritual nature.

210
00:22:19,617 --> 00:22:23,673
"Once you're in business with
somebody, you're in business for life."

211
00:22:23,673 --> 00:22:26,094
Like a marriage.

212
00:22:43,537 --> 00:22:45,083
Partner.

213
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:13,000
Damn!

214
00:23:13,472 --> 00:23:15,220
Where is it?

215
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,608
Where is it?

216
00:23:17,608 --> 00:23:20,116
Catherine...?

217
00:23:20,116 --> 00:23:22,625
The account ledger, have you seen it?

218
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:25,889
Don't you keep it
in that little safe at home?

219
00:23:25,889 --> 00:23:28,860
It's not in the safe at home,
it's not anywhere!

220
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:32,446
Tell me you didn't take it.
- I didn't take it.

221
00:23:33,837 --> 00:23:36,382
Pete, tell me the truth.

222
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:39,308
You're not helping her
to pull something here.

223
00:23:39,308 --> 00:23:41,272
Who?
- Josie.

224
00:23:42,284 --> 00:23:43,034
No!

225
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:49,469
Pull what here?
- Oh, Peter.

226
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:52,819
Forget everything we've ever done
to hurt each other.

227
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:57,077
Just like that!
- Temporarily.

228
00:23:57,077 --> 00:24:00,138
Our marriage is
a living train wreck, but...

229
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:04,018
there used to be something
caring between us.

230
00:24:04,018 --> 00:24:06,110
The fella who caught my eye.

231
00:24:06,914 --> 00:24:11,090
The lumberjack who could
scamper up a tree like a cat.

232
00:24:12,057 --> 00:24:16,113
The boss's sister
from that big house on the hill.

233
00:24:16,908 --> 00:24:20,869
A summer's indiscretion
and here we are.

234
00:24:20,869 --> 00:24:23,011
Catherine!

235
00:24:24,518 --> 00:24:26,482
Oh, Pete!

236
00:24:27,488 --> 00:24:31,198
I never should have taken you
to that house on the hill.

237
00:24:31,198 --> 00:24:35,516
Well, I have no complaints
about the house.

238
00:24:36,814 --> 00:24:38,276
As for me,

239
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:41,911
taking my pleasure
in lashing out at the one person

240
00:24:41,911 --> 00:24:45,626
who was decent enough to stand
by me through all my foolishness.

241
00:24:45,626 --> 00:24:48,979
I know things haven't been
easy for you.

242
00:24:52,034 --> 00:24:53,830
Peter...

243
00:24:55,547 --> 00:24:58,509
Somewhere under all that scar tissue,

244
00:24:58,509 --> 00:25:01,484
there's the faintest flicker
of what we once felt.

245
00:25:01,484 --> 00:25:04,905
I'm asking you to feel that now.

246
00:25:04,905 --> 00:25:08,876
Why... exactly?

247
00:25:09,933 --> 00:25:12,431
Because I'm in trouble.

248
00:25:12,431 --> 00:25:15,820
Given what I've become
and how I've treated people,

249
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:20,254
there's no one else I can turn to.
I need your help.

250
00:25:24,944 --> 00:25:26,323
Catherine!

251
00:25:26,323 --> 00:25:28,329
Catherine!

252
00:25:37,347 --> 00:25:39,926
So Fred starts to cuff him,

253
00:25:39,926 --> 00:25:42,062
and Harry turns to go.

254
00:25:42,062 --> 00:25:45,533
Suddenly, Jacques throws
an elbow at Fred... WHAM!

255
00:25:45,533 --> 00:25:50,425
In one move, he takes Fred's gun...
and he's got the drop on Harry.

256
00:25:50,425 --> 00:25:53,689
Harry is deader
than a pound of roadside stew!

257
00:25:53,689 --> 00:25:58,294
Then, all of a sudden,
a single shot rings out.

258
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:05,697
Andy, my man!
- All right, Andy!

259
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,764
Go ahead, Andy,
give it your best shot! Go on!

260
00:26:55,418 --> 00:26:57,130
Oh, Andy!

261
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:59,303
Oh, Punky...

262
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:02,314
I'm pregnant.

263
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:22,383
Uh-oh!

264
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,986
Fresh coffee.

265
00:27:39,995 --> 00:27:42,207
What?
- Let me talk to the sheriff.

266
00:27:42,207 --> 00:27:47,184
The sheriff isn't in at the moment.
Would you care to leave a message?

267
00:27:48,025 --> 00:27:52,532
You tell him Leo Johnson said
to check out James Hurley.

268
00:27:52,532 --> 00:27:56,300
He's an easy rider.
- An easy rider?

269
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:01,562
You got that?
- Yes, but Leo, wait! Leo!

270
00:28:09,726 --> 00:28:13,318
Did you take Laura and Ronnette
up to your cabin that night?

271
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:17,416
They'd both been up there before.
They was no nuns!

272
00:28:17,416 --> 00:28:20,389
That's where you took the pictures
for "Flesh World"?

273
00:28:20,389 --> 00:28:22,430
That was Laura's idea.

274
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:25,443
She talked Ronnette
into making them ads.

275
00:28:25,443 --> 00:28:29,334
What did you and Leo
fight about that night?

276
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:31,885
Bastard hit me with a whiskey bottle!

277
00:28:31,885 --> 00:28:35,649
Why?
- I don't know, that's why we fought!

278
00:28:35,649 --> 00:28:39,281
I'm bleeding like a stuck pig,
and he's laughing.

279
00:28:39,281 --> 00:28:42,842
So you used Leo's shirt to stop
the bleeding. What then?

280
00:28:42,842 --> 00:28:44,803
I got sick.

281
00:28:44,803 --> 00:28:50,829
I go outside, pass out.
I wake up, I'm laying on the ground.

282
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:55,945
Where was Leo?
- Leo and the girls, they're gone.

283
00:28:55,945 --> 00:29:00,137
What about the train car?
- I don't know nothing about that.

284
00:29:00,137 --> 00:29:04,265
I come down the hill,
Leo's car is gone.

285
00:29:05,239 --> 00:29:09,544
Had to walk 15 miles
back to my own house.

286
00:29:14,104 --> 00:29:17,316
When they brought him in,
he was rambling incoherently.

287
00:29:17,316 --> 00:29:20,542
These things he said to you,
they're pretty incredible.

288
00:29:20,542 --> 00:29:23,674
I know. Let's hope he pulls through.

289
00:29:23,674 --> 00:29:26,179
Well, he's stabilised anyway.

290
00:29:26,179 --> 00:29:30,829
So Leo had to take the girls
to the train car by himself?

291
00:29:30,829 --> 00:29:34,673
You believe him?
- He's too stupid to lie.

292
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:36,849
He'll testify against Leo,
we got him.

293
00:29:36,849 --> 00:29:39,148
We got to find Leo first.

294
00:29:39,148 --> 00:29:42,698
Doc, how's Jacoby?
- He's out of the woods.

295
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:47,632
Listen... he says he got a phone call
from Laura Palmer.

296
00:29:47,632 --> 00:29:51,026
He was on his way to see her
when he was jumped.

297
00:29:51,026 --> 00:29:54,329
Any description of the assailant?
- He didn't see him.

298
00:29:54,329 --> 00:29:59,507
But he says he saw Laura Palmer
by the gazebo in Easter Park.

299
00:30:03,574 --> 00:30:05,072
It's not here!

300
00:30:05,072 --> 00:30:06,744
It's not here!

301
00:30:06,744 --> 00:30:10,546
It's not here, either. Damn!

302
00:30:11,937 --> 00:30:13,769
Oh...

303
00:30:15,283 --> 00:30:16,566
...Midge!

304
00:30:17,499 --> 00:30:19,628
Midge Jones.

305
00:30:19,628 --> 00:30:22,170
What are you doing?

306
00:30:23,396 --> 00:30:26,821
It's...my old high school yearbook.

307
00:30:27,661 --> 00:30:30,289
I thought it was gone forever.

308
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:31,834
Oh, Pete.

309
00:30:33,055 --> 00:30:34,469
Sorry.

310
00:30:41,543 --> 00:30:43,126
What?

311
00:30:43,126 --> 00:30:45,471
It's at the mill.

312
00:30:45,471 --> 00:30:48,901
What is?
- What you're looking for.

313
00:30:48,901 --> 00:30:52,496
Drying shed three,
near the north gate.

314
00:30:52,496 --> 00:30:54,547
Pete...

315
00:30:58,228 --> 00:31:01,440
Yes, I'll look in the other room.

316
00:31:04,502 --> 00:31:07,546
What do you want? Talk terms.

317
00:31:08,432 --> 00:31:10,394
We'll let you know.

318
00:31:29,717 --> 00:31:33,178
Norma, you still have that
down comforter on your bed?

319
00:31:33,178 --> 00:31:35,068
Yes, Hank.

320
00:31:35,068 --> 00:31:38,287
The mattresses
they give you on your bunk,

321
00:31:38,287 --> 00:31:42,382
they're probably...
this thick, you know.

322
00:31:43,182 --> 00:31:46,810
And you lie there at night... thinking,

323
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:52,035
"If this mattress is so skinny, how
did they get all those rocks inside?"

324
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:58,004
So... you'll forgive me
if I tell you that night after night,

325
00:31:58,004 --> 00:32:02,853
I dreamed of you
lying on that big feather bed.

326
00:32:07,417 --> 00:32:13,971
I guess the hired help shouldn't be so
familiar with the boss lady, eh?

327
00:32:13,971 --> 00:32:16,862
I can't blame you for dreaming.

328
00:32:16,862 --> 00:32:20,496
I wasn't just dreaming
about being with you, Norma.

329
00:32:20,496 --> 00:32:23,005
What I was trying to...

330
00:32:24,102 --> 00:32:28,490
I shouldn't be saying this much.
- I think you should.

331
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:31,503
No... I haven't earned the right,
Norma.

332
00:32:31,503 --> 00:32:33,674
I've been back what? Two days.

333
00:32:33,674 --> 00:32:36,848
Say what you want to say.

334
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:44,747
I've been trying to picture a whole
life with you... with the diner.

335
00:32:44,747 --> 00:32:48,227
Making it soar. Making it blue sky.

336
00:32:51,534 --> 00:32:54,829
I always talk too big,
that's my biggest fault.

337
00:32:54,829 --> 00:32:57,883
I learned that talking
to my counsellor inside.

338
00:32:57,883 --> 00:33:00,941
This is new territory for me.

339
00:33:02,031 --> 00:33:03,909
But I'm gonna try.

340
00:33:04,915 --> 00:33:08,507
You know... it's 20 years
we've been together next month.

341
00:33:08,507 --> 00:33:10,426
Can you believe it?

342
00:33:10,426 --> 00:33:12,600
Maybe we're doing this all backwards.

343
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,488
Maybe it's the next 20 that counts.

344
00:33:17,712 --> 00:33:22,219
Give me time, Norma.
I'll make you proud of me yet.

345
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:44,507
Nadine?

346
00:33:49,869 --> 00:33:51,283
Nadine?

347
00:33:52,046 --> 00:33:52,766
Honey?

348
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,618
Oh, God! Nadine, don't you do this.

349
00:34:01,618 --> 00:34:02,995
Nadine!

350
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:12,271
I need an ambulance.
My wife has just taken some pills.

351
00:34:12,271 --> 00:34:14,324
422, Riverside.

352
00:34:14,324 --> 00:34:16,832
For the love of God, hurry!

353
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,428
Stay with me, Nadine.

354
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,117
Please, don't go.

355
00:34:28,844 --> 00:34:30,841
Stay with me.

356
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:41,614
Leo Johnson's gone to ground.
I bet he's holed up near his home.

357
00:34:41,614 --> 00:34:45,336
Sheriff, Leo Johnson called.
- When?

358
00:34:45,336 --> 00:34:48,088
Ten minutes ago.
He left this message.

359
00:34:48,088 --> 00:34:53,822
And Sheriff, in the background
I could hear a clock striking.

360
00:34:53,822 --> 00:34:58,136
What kind of clock, Lucy?
- Like the clock at Easter Park.

361
00:34:58,136 --> 00:35:01,639
Harry!
- Hawk. Good work, Lucy.

362
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:03,689
Pull surveillance off Leo's house.

363
00:35:03,689 --> 00:35:05,868
Set up a perimeter
around Easter Park.

364
00:35:05,868 --> 00:35:09,125
Got it.
- You get some cars over there.

365
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:11,596
Harry, I gotta talk to you...

366
00:35:11,596 --> 00:35:16,693
Harry, let me talk to James.
You want to investigate this?

367
00:35:16,693 --> 00:35:18,790
Come on, James.

368
00:35:21,178 --> 00:35:22,509
Harry...

369
00:35:23,268 --> 00:35:25,897
Harry, is it true?

370
00:35:25,897 --> 00:35:30,079
You've found the killer?
- We've arrested a suspect.

371
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,385
But is it him, Harry?
- I can't release any details now.

372
00:35:34,385 --> 00:35:36,558
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

373
00:35:36,558 --> 00:35:41,996
Leland, there's nothing you can do here.
You should be home with Sarah now.

374
00:35:41,996 --> 00:35:44,840
Yes, you're right.
Of course, you're right.

375
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:48,849
You're going back to the hospital?
- No, I'm heading home.

376
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:53,160
Thank you, Will.
- Don't give it a thought.

377
00:36:01,949 --> 00:36:03,911
Hospital...

378
00:36:05,169 --> 00:36:07,464
I think you ought to listen
to this tape.

379
00:36:07,464 --> 00:36:09,051
Why's that?

380
00:36:09,051 --> 00:36:11,723
It was Laura's. We found it.

381
00:36:11,723 --> 00:36:15,619
I think it'll help you find
who you're looking for.

382
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:19,799
Who might that be?
- Somebody with a red Corvette.

383
00:36:21,645 --> 00:36:24,488
Doctor Jacoby's in hospital
with a heart attack.

384
00:36:24,488 --> 00:36:27,868
Heart attack?
- He said he saw Laura tonight.

385
00:36:28,045 --> 00:36:32,302
What kind of dangerous game
have you been playing?

386
00:36:33,355 --> 00:36:36,948
Is Jacoby gonna be all right?

387
00:36:41,928 --> 00:36:44,890
I've been very patient
with you, James.

388
00:36:45,775 --> 00:36:50,664
From here on out, I'm gonna need
a better set of answers.

389
00:36:55,310 --> 00:37:00,198
Let's start with why this was
in the gas tank of your bike?

390
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,305
Fine, fine, fine. OK.

391
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,322
OK. Ghostwood, fantastic!

392
00:37:15,322 --> 00:37:17,489
I love it!

393
00:37:17,489 --> 00:37:20,121
All your revisions are included.

394
00:37:20,121 --> 00:37:25,057
Ben, I am so happy,
I can't even say how much.

395
00:37:27,701 --> 00:37:30,163
After you.
- No, no, no!

396
00:37:30,163 --> 00:37:32,168
After you.

397
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:34,388
After me!

398
00:37:37,737 --> 00:37:39,117
Excuse me.

399
00:37:40,832 --> 00:37:42,246
Benjamin Horne here.

400
00:37:42,797 --> 00:37:45,129
Time to black flag that little firebug.

401
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:48,101
Leo Johnson's gonna get
a house call.

402
00:37:48,101 --> 00:37:50,107
Proceed.

403
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:05,116
Shelly?

404
00:38:08,138 --> 00:38:10,135
Shelly, are you here?

405
00:38:13,115 --> 00:38:15,909
Shelly's not here, Bobby.
- Leo!

406
00:38:15,909 --> 00:38:19,176
Am I glad to see you...
- Something I can help you with?

407
00:38:19,176 --> 00:38:22,854
It's you I was looking for.
The cops are after you.

408
00:38:22,854 --> 00:38:24,654
Liar!

409
00:38:27,583 --> 00:38:30,426
Shelly's dead! You killed her!

410
00:38:34,316 --> 00:38:35,316
Leo!

411
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,264
Later, Leo.

412
00:39:35,494 --> 00:39:39,503
I can't understand a word,
you have a thing in your mouth.

413
00:39:51,868 --> 00:39:54,079
Who are you?
- Shelly Johnson.

414
00:39:54,711 --> 00:39:59,136
You know who called me here?
- No. Please help me.

415
00:39:59,136 --> 00:40:02,153
Be quiet... I'm thinking.

416
00:40:05,124 --> 00:40:06,372
Oh, God.

417
00:40:06,372 --> 00:40:08,632
Oh, God!

418
00:41:53,072 --> 00:41:55,568
Any of the boys still inside?
- Not sure.

419
00:41:55,568 --> 00:41:59,084
Shift was over, but we're
still trying to get a count.

420
00:41:59,084 --> 00:42:01,342
Seen Catherine?
- No, Pete.

421
00:42:01,342 --> 00:42:03,148
That's her car.

422
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:04,946
Jesus God!

423
00:42:04,946 --> 00:42:07,577
You think she's still inside?

424
00:42:07,577 --> 00:42:10,711
I guess I'm gonna have to find out.

425
00:42:12,893 --> 00:42:15,937
Pete, that ain't such a good idea.

426
00:42:19,416 --> 00:42:22,092
She's still my wife.

427
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,345
Catherine!

428
00:42:36,874 --> 00:42:39,087
And that is that!

429
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:43,764
Ben, is this a great moment?

430
00:42:43,764 --> 00:42:46,992
Ghostwood!
- Incredible!

431
00:42:46,992 --> 00:42:49,373
Ghostwood, eh?

432
00:42:51,887 --> 00:42:56,110
Einar, tonight
you play on the house.

433
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,501
This is... marvellous.

434
00:43:00,501 --> 00:43:03,921
Enjoy, my friend, enjoy!

435
00:43:05,603 --> 00:43:06,852
To Ghostwood.

436
00:43:06,852 --> 00:43:10,949
To Ghostwood Estates
and Country Club!

437
00:43:15,765 --> 00:43:18,441
Congratulations, Boss.

438
00:43:21,912 --> 00:43:24,326
Blackie, old pal...

439
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:27,504
this calls for a celebration.

440
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:31,357
Let's have a look... at the new girl.

441
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,945
Good luck, honey.

442
00:43:47,295 --> 00:43:48,709
Close your eyes.

443
00:43:49,436 --> 00:43:53,826
This is such stuff
as dreams are made of.

444
00:44:01,856 --> 00:44:05,698
Diane, 4:37 am.

445
00:44:05,698 --> 00:44:09,456
After a long investigative night,
returning to the Great Northern.

446
00:44:09,456 --> 00:44:14,356
One suspect in custody. Leo Johnson,
who I believe killed Laura Palmer,

447
00:44:14,356 --> 00:44:18,540
won't be able to escape
the dragnet much longer.

448
00:44:21,176 --> 00:44:24,803
As you can hear
from the ambient sound around me,

449
00:44:24,803 --> 00:44:29,198
and I notice, with some relief,
the Icelandic group on my floor

450
00:44:29,198 --> 00:44:32,338
have either checked or passed out,

451
00:44:34,348 --> 00:44:38,190
I may not need the earplugs
which I received today, Diane,

452
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:42,994
although I may put them to use
as a precautionary measure.

453
00:44:42,994 --> 00:44:45,092
I ordered hot milk from room service.

454
00:44:45,092 --> 00:44:50,317
Here's hoping that does the job, and
I can catch some quality sack time.

455
00:44:51,075 --> 00:44:56,165
24-hour room service, the premier
achievement of modern civilisation.

456
00:45:05,753 --> 00:45:07,835
"My Special Agent".

457
00:45:20,933 --> 00:45:22,728
Cooper here.

458
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:27,448
Who is this?

459
00:45:28,919 --> 00:45:31,463
Could this wait
till tomorrow morning?

460
00:45:32,056 --> 00:45:34,469
Please excuse me,
I've got room service.

461
00:45:34,469 --> 00:45:36,777
We found him...

462
00:45:38,328 --> 00:45:42,752
We found Leo Johnson.
He's been shot. Agent Cooper?
