1
00:02:31,745 --> 00:02:35,836
No, no, no, not in my room.
In here, in here!

2
00:02:35,836 --> 00:02:39,348
Jerry, back from Paris?
- Ben, what a nightmare!

3
00:02:39,348 --> 00:02:43,491
Right there! No, right there.
What is with you guys?

4
00:02:43,491 --> 00:02:46,589
I've got a sandwich in there,
I want all those bags open.

5
00:02:46,589 --> 00:02:48,887
We're looking till we find it...

6
00:02:48,887 --> 00:02:53,198
Hey, Audrey, Uncle Jerry's back.

7
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,908
Sylvia...
- Benjamin!

8
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,353
OK, OK... Gone! Goodbye!

9
00:03:03,696 --> 00:03:08,667
Brother Ben, this is the best
damn sandwich I ever ate.

10
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:11,718
It's a baguette with brie and butter.

11
00:03:11,718 --> 00:03:14,390
I had four of these every day I was there.

12
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,328
You've got to try this thing.

13
00:03:17,328 --> 00:03:20,376
Here, go ahead, eat it. Go ahead.

14
00:03:20,376 --> 00:03:22,631
Go ahead!

15
00:03:22,631 --> 00:03:24,313
Oh, yeah.

16
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:41,960
This is incredible, Jer!

17
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:49,948
You know what this reminds us of?
You know who likes this?

18
00:03:49,948 --> 00:03:53,417
It reminds us of Ginny and Jenny
down by the river.

19
00:03:55,762 --> 00:04:01,317
My God, you're right!
- Am I right? Am I right?

20
00:04:01,317 --> 00:04:03,079
Oh, no wonder!

21
00:04:11,572 --> 00:04:15,081
Jer, outside, outside.

22
00:04:20,687 --> 00:04:22,685
Always a pleasure.

23
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,242
Jerry...

24
00:04:39,927 --> 00:04:45,064
Leland's daughter was murdered,
and the Norwegians left.

25
00:04:45,064 --> 00:04:48,199
Did they sign?
- Deal's off.

26
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:59,706
We had those Vikings by the horns!
What happened?

27
00:04:59,706 --> 00:05:05,012
We're not a hundred percent sure,
they took their translator with them.

28
00:05:06,858 --> 00:05:10,913
Did you say Leland's daughter
was murdered?

29
00:05:10,913 --> 00:05:11,914
Yes.

30
00:05:15,975 --> 00:05:18,270
I'm depressed.

31
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:22,613
I can fix that.

32
00:05:23,418 --> 00:05:26,263
There's a new girl
at One-Eyed Jacks,

33
00:05:26,263 --> 00:05:29,973
freshly scented
from the perfume counter.

34
00:05:29,973 --> 00:05:36,212
And you, brother Jer, have
a 50-50 chance of being first in line.

35
00:05:39,101 --> 00:05:41,433
I like those odds.

36
00:05:42,573 --> 00:05:47,498
All work and no play
make Ben and Jerry dull boys.

37
00:05:47,498 --> 00:05:51,850
That's right.
- Let's jump in the boat.

38
00:06:10,802 --> 00:06:12,884
That's great huckleberry pie,
Mrs Hayward.

39
00:06:12,884 --> 00:06:14,267
Thank you, James.

40
00:06:15,444 --> 00:06:20,618
Well... Mrs Hayward and I are going
to say good night, James.

41
00:06:20,618 --> 00:06:24,222
Good night, James.
- Good night.

42
00:06:24,222 --> 00:06:26,557
Good night, dear.
- Good night, Mom.

43
00:06:26,557 --> 00:06:30,115
Don't worry about the dishes,
I'll clean up.

44
00:06:32,549 --> 00:06:35,678
Are you coming to church with us
in the morning, Donna?

45
00:06:35,678 --> 00:06:36,678
Yes.

46
00:06:39,241 --> 00:06:41,786
Nine o'clock sharp.
- OK.

47
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,681
Good night, James.
- Good night, sir.

48
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:06,920
Hi, sailor!

49
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,972
Good evening, Mr Horne.

50
00:07:12,696 --> 00:07:16,039
Ben, we're not gonna go
in the casino first?

51
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:21,473
Jer, I didn't come here to lose my shirt,
I just came to take it off.

52
00:07:21,473 --> 00:07:25,785
Kim, the Horne brothers are here.
- I'll tell Blackie.

53
00:07:36,828 --> 00:07:39,670
I'd like to order two drinks.

54
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,717
One double scotch on the rocks.

55
00:07:42,717 --> 00:07:46,692
And my brother would like
a double scotch on the rocks.

56
00:07:47,617 --> 00:07:50,245
That's two double scotch on the rocks.

57
00:07:50,245 --> 00:07:53,386
Next stop, rocket science.

58
00:07:53,386 --> 00:07:54,346
Jerry...

59
00:08:08,652 --> 00:08:10,817
Blackie!
- Benjamin.

60
00:08:13,922 --> 00:08:16,717
"Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?

61
00:08:16,717 --> 00:08:19,104
"Thou art more lovely
and more temperate

62
00:08:19,104 --> 00:08:22,368
"Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May

63
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:25,915
"And every fair from fair
sometimes declines

64
00:08:25,915 --> 00:08:29,219
"By chance or nature's
changing course untrimm'd

65
00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:32,239
"But thy eternal summer
shall not fade

66
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:35,667
"Nor lose possession
of that fair thouowest

67
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:39,379
"Nor shall death brag..."
- Where's the new girl?

68
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:46,448
When you really want love,
you'll find it waiting for you.

69
00:08:54,154 --> 00:08:54,874
Heads.

70
00:09:50,821 --> 00:09:54,246
Come on. We'll take care of you, Jerry.

71
00:09:57,011 --> 00:09:58,258
Well...

72
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:09,547
Donna, I don't think that
what we're feeling or doing is wrong.

73
00:10:11,147 --> 00:10:13,144
Why not?

74
00:10:14,157 --> 00:10:16,451
Because it's the truth.

75
00:10:16,451 --> 00:10:20,043
Because I think it would have
turned out this way anyway.

76
00:10:20,043 --> 00:10:20,883
You do?

77
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:28,789
Yes. I remember
a time in school, in the hall.

78
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:32,797
We were suddenly alone,
and we looked at each other.

79
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:38,576
I almost told you I loved you then.

80
00:10:40,963 --> 00:10:43,044
It's true.

81
00:10:43,044 --> 00:10:45,266
It is true, isn't it?

82
00:10:48,283 --> 00:10:52,873
Oh, James. I guess because of Laura
I couldn't say anything.

83
00:10:52,873 --> 00:10:57,599
I couldn't even let myself think it.
- Me, too.

84
00:11:01,121 --> 00:11:04,546
Are we gonna be together, James?

85
00:11:05,554 --> 00:11:07,517
Are we?

86
00:11:14,253 --> 00:11:16,668
Are we, James?

87
00:11:44,482 --> 00:11:46,859
Special Agent Dale Cooper.
- Hello, it's Hawk.

88
00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:49,786
Deputy Hawk,
how is Ronnette Pulaski?

89
00:11:49,786 --> 00:11:54,218
Body and spirit are still far apart.
- What did you find out?

90
00:11:54,218 --> 00:11:58,152
Ronnette recently quit at the
perfume counter of Horne's store.

91
00:11:58,152 --> 00:12:00,869
Everything else is quiet,
except there was...

92
00:12:00,869 --> 00:12:04,176
a one-armed man snooping
around intensive care.

93
00:12:04,176 --> 00:12:07,604
A one-armed man?
- Left.

94
00:12:07,604 --> 00:12:12,700
Did you question him?
- No. I pursued, but he got away.

95
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:18,849
Maintain an around-the-clock watch on
Ronnette. We'll speak in the morning.

96
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:07,530
Got it?

97
00:13:53,277 --> 00:13:56,655
Supposed to leave it
in this stupid football.

98
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,210
Is it in there?

99
00:14:00,846 --> 00:14:02,844
Not all of it.

100
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:07,031
Cash on delivery, Bobby.

101
00:14:15,191 --> 00:14:16,606
He's got a gun.

102
00:14:20,837 --> 00:14:23,762
Hey, Leo.
- Hey.

103
00:14:27,235 --> 00:14:29,114
Who's that?

104
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,794
Is someone with you?
- Never mind.

105
00:14:34,262 --> 00:14:36,093
Toss it over here, quarterback.

106
00:14:40,828 --> 00:14:42,076
It's empty.

107
00:14:42,076 --> 00:14:45,342
Weren't you supposed to
leave something for me?

108
00:14:45,804 --> 00:14:50,027
This barely covers what we paid for.
Where's the rest?

109
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:53,537
Where's the rest of the money?
- There's a...

110
00:14:53,537 --> 00:14:56,420
There's a problem.
- Problem?

111
00:14:57,012 --> 00:15:01,770
Laura had the other half.
- You think you got problems?

112
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:05,116
We can get it.
Wait until everything settles down.

113
00:15:05,116 --> 00:15:07,671
You punks owe me ten grand.

114
00:15:09,183 --> 00:15:11,727
Leo needs a new pair of shoes.

115
00:15:12,736 --> 00:15:17,577
OK. We won't take delivery
on the drugs until you get the cash.

116
00:15:17,577 --> 00:15:21,597
Do I look like a bank?
- I appreciate your position.

117
00:15:21,597 --> 00:15:24,863
This thing with Laura,
how could I anticipate it?

118
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:27,560
Laura was a wild girl.

119
00:15:27,775 --> 00:15:29,608
Tell me about it.

120
00:15:29,608 --> 00:15:32,411
Maybe. Someday.

121
00:15:32,877 --> 00:15:36,837
Take your hand
out of your pocket, Mike.

122
00:15:36,837 --> 00:15:40,562
What is your problem, Leo?
- Problem?

123
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:44,121
You want to know about problems?

124
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:44,871
OK.

125
00:15:45,967 --> 00:15:51,105
You're on the road,
driving back and forth, gone for days.

126
00:15:51,105 --> 00:15:54,953
You get back, and guess what?
- What?

127
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:59,086
You find out your old lady's
been giving it away.

128
00:15:59,086 --> 00:16:01,310
Yeah?
- Yeah.

129
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:05,700
Stepping out in your own
damn bedroom. That's a problem.

130
00:16:06,668 --> 00:16:09,928
I guess so. I guess it is.

131
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:15,148
Do you know who?
- A man needs a clean house.

132
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:17,829
Sure. So do you know who?

133
00:16:20,763 --> 00:16:23,557
I'll take care of it.
- Sure.

134
00:16:23,557 --> 00:16:26,860
And this other thing,
we'll take care of it, don't worry.

135
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,788
We'll get the cash,
and everything will be square.

136
00:16:38,118 --> 00:16:42,042
Go out for a pass.
- What?

137
00:16:43,346 --> 00:16:46,390
Go out for a pass.
- OK, just...

138
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,229
Run.
- Take it easy.

139
00:16:48,229 --> 00:16:49,310
Run! Run!

140
00:17:08,103 --> 00:17:10,732
Damn it, I'm done, Bobby.

141
00:17:10,732 --> 00:17:13,950
Let's get the hell out of here.

142
00:17:44,739 --> 00:17:47,665
Ed!
- Sorry, I didn't see it.

143
00:17:47,665 --> 00:17:49,832
You stepped on my drape runner!

144
00:17:49,832 --> 00:17:54,064
It was in the middle of the floor.
- Think that's an accident?

145
00:17:54,064 --> 00:17:59,287
I laid those out there myself. I was up
all night working on that invention.

146
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:02,912
I'm going to have world's first
100% quiet runner.

147
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:09,779
I'm real sorry, Nadine.
- Ed, you make me sick!

148
00:18:09,804 --> 00:18:11,004
I'm going to have world's first
100% quiet runner.

149
00:18:40,654 --> 00:18:45,411
That's it! Exactly sixty feet, six inches.

150
00:18:45,411 --> 00:18:48,002
It's perfect.

151
00:18:48,516 --> 00:18:51,478
What do you think he's up to?

152
00:18:52,907 --> 00:18:54,239
It beats me.

153
00:18:58,051 --> 00:18:59,716
Invitation to love.

154
00:19:00,267 --> 00:19:02,848
Each day brings a new beginning,

155
00:19:02,848 --> 00:19:08,964
and every hour holds the promise
of an invitation to love.

156
00:19:10,889 --> 00:19:11,609
Right.

157
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:20,254
Who is it?
- The big, bad bobcat.

158
00:19:20,254 --> 00:19:22,512
Are you crazy?
What are you doing here?

159
00:19:22,512 --> 00:19:25,395
I just passed Leo out in North Bend.

160
00:19:25,395 --> 00:19:28,994
We've got at least twenty minutes.
- Where's your car?

161
00:19:28,994 --> 00:19:31,248
Parked in the woods. Open Sesame!

162
00:19:31,248 --> 00:19:35,683
Somebody might see me out here,
and that'd be worse.

163
00:19:37,572 --> 00:19:41,199
Bobby, you cannot
come by here like this.

164
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,212
We can't meet, for a while.

165
00:19:51,665 --> 00:19:54,246
What the hell happened to you?

166
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,189
Leo Johnson happened to me.

167
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:04,080
That bastard. Come here.

168
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,475
Bobby! If he finds out about us,
he's gonna kill you.

169
00:20:08,936 --> 00:20:11,018
He'll kill us both.

170
00:20:17,218 --> 00:20:23,188
If he ever does this to you again,
I'll kill him.

171
00:20:25,707 --> 00:20:28,002
I mean it.

172
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,828
Cup of coffee.

173
00:21:05,605 --> 00:21:09,659
It's not the first time,
it won't be the last,

174
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:12,462
but I'm in that doghouse again.

175
00:21:12,462 --> 00:21:14,926
What happened this time?

176
00:21:14,926 --> 00:21:20,236
I popped a grease gun, stepped on a
drape runner, and all hell broke loose.

177
00:21:20,236 --> 00:21:25,964
I ran into Nadine in the hardware store.
All she talked about is the drape runners.

178
00:21:25,964 --> 00:21:29,521
She's got one big bee in her bonnet.

179
00:21:33,205 --> 00:21:36,417
Bobby sure gave me a good one?

180
00:21:36,803 --> 00:21:40,597
Where do you want these rocks?
- There by the doughnuts, Deputy.

181
00:21:40,597 --> 00:21:43,535
Anyone for a warm-up?
- Oh, yeah!

182
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:46,420
You bet!
- Thanks, Lucy.

183
00:21:51,439 --> 00:21:52,937
Damn good coffee!

184
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,777
And hot!

185
00:21:55,211 --> 00:21:57,755
Would everyone please take a seat?

186
00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:13,648
By way of explaining
what we're about to do,

187
00:22:13,648 --> 00:22:19,542
I am first gonna tell you a little bit
about the country called...

188
00:22:19,432 --> 00:22:20,152
Tibet.

189
00:22:25,421 --> 00:22:27,216
An extremely spiritual country,

190
00:22:27,216 --> 00:22:30,644
the leader of Tibet is known
as the Dalai Lama.

191
00:22:30,644 --> 00:22:35,032
In 1950,
communist China invaded Tibet.

192
00:22:35,032 --> 00:22:37,413
While leaving the Dalai Lama
in charge,

193
00:22:37,413 --> 00:22:39,886
they seized control of the country.

194
00:22:39,886 --> 00:22:43,067
In 1959, after a Tibetan uprising
against the Chinese,

195
00:22:43,067 --> 00:22:45,906
the Dalai Lama fled to India

196
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,839
and has lived in exile ever since.

197
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:51,260
Following a dream three years ago,

198
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,276
I have become moved
by the plight of the Tibetans

199
00:22:54,276 --> 00:22:56,864
and filled with a desire to help them.

200
00:22:56,864 --> 00:22:58,749
I also awoke from the same dream

201
00:22:58,749 --> 00:23:03,142
realising I had subconsciously gained
knowledge of a deductive technique

202
00:23:03,142 --> 00:23:06,236
involving mind-body coordination
operating hand in hand

203
00:23:06,236 --> 00:23:09,330
with the deepest level of intuition.

204
00:23:09,185 --> 00:23:14,324
Sheriff, Deputy Hawk, if you will please
assist me, I will now demonstrate.

205
00:23:21,551 --> 00:23:23,298
On the day of her death

206
00:23:23,298 --> 00:23:25,977
Laura Palmer wrote
the following in her diary,

207
00:23:25,977 --> 00:23:32,461
"Nervous about meeting 'J' tonight."
Today we'll concentrate on the 'J's".

208
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,725
Harry, when I give the word,

209
00:23:37,725 --> 00:23:41,821
would you read aloud each name
I've written on the blackboard?

210
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:46,676
Deputy Hawk, stand here and hold this
bucket of rocks where I can get to them.

211
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:49,016
Would you please put on
the kitchen mittens.

212
00:23:49,016 --> 00:23:52,781
Deputy Andy, move down,
stand by the bottle.

213
00:23:54,588 --> 00:23:57,931
Lucy, take this piece of chalk.

214
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,394
Not too near, Andy!

215
00:24:00,988 --> 00:24:03,450
I'm getting excited.

216
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:08,505
If I hit the bottle after a particular name,
make a check on the name.

217
00:24:08,505 --> 00:24:14,279
Sheriff, when you say the name, state
that person's relationship to Laura Palmer.

218
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:16,582
Ready?
- Ready.

219
00:24:25,202 --> 00:24:28,460
James Hurley... secret boyfriend.

220
00:24:29,132 --> 00:24:31,130
James Hurley.

221
00:24:36,201 --> 00:24:39,995
Josie Packard... was instructed
in English by Laura.

222
00:24:39,995 --> 00:24:42,802
Josie Packard.

223
00:24:47,115 --> 00:24:49,745
So there's no check
next to either of these names?

224
00:24:49,745 --> 00:24:52,172
That's correct. Please continue.

225
00:24:52,636 --> 00:24:56,311
Dr Lawrence Jacoby...
Laura's psychiatrist.

226
00:24:56,861 --> 00:24:59,738
Dr Lawrence Jacoby.

227
00:25:02,339 --> 00:25:04,336
You did it! You hit it!

228
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:08,391
Lucy, make a note that the bottle
was struck, but did not break.

229
00:25:08,391 --> 00:25:10,152
Very important.

230
00:25:10,152 --> 00:25:13,745
Andy, put that bottle back
exactly where it was!

231
00:25:15,219 --> 00:25:19,692
Johnny Horne. Laura was
his special education tutor.

232
00:25:19,692 --> 00:25:22,156
Johnny Horne.

233
00:25:28,852 --> 00:25:33,409
Norma Jennings... helped Laura with
the meals-on-wheels programme.

234
00:25:33,409 --> 00:25:35,708
Norma Jennings.

235
00:25:38,429 --> 00:25:41,890
Shelly Johnson...
waitress at diner, friend.

236
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:44,031
Shelly Johnson.

237
00:25:49,573 --> 00:25:51,618
Sorry, Andy.
- Sweetie?

238
00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:56,297
It didn't hurt.
It didn't hurt a bit.

239
00:25:56,297 --> 00:26:00,191
Where there's no sense,
there's no feeling, Andy.

240
00:26:06,468 --> 00:26:08,300
Coop...

241
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,015
Tell me...

242
00:26:11,015 --> 00:26:16,547
The idea for all this
really came from a dream?

243
00:26:16,547 --> 00:26:18,796
Yes. It did.

244
00:26:26,542 --> 00:26:30,504
Jack with One Eye...

245
00:26:30,504 --> 00:26:35,155
Maybe it's the letter 'i',
but there's no 'i' in Jack.

246
00:26:35,155 --> 00:26:37,698
I think it means he only had one eye.

247
00:26:37,698 --> 00:26:40,545
Sounds like Nadine,
Big Ed Hurley's wife.

248
00:26:40,545 --> 00:26:43,478
No, there's a casino up north
called One-Eyed Jacks,

249
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:45,275
across the border in Canada.

250
00:26:45,275 --> 00:26:48,324
We're gonna have to check that place out.

251
00:26:48,324 --> 00:26:52,548
I'm going to erase this,
because it's a place, not a person.

252
00:26:52,548 --> 00:26:55,053
Maybe the person
could be in the place.

253
00:26:55,053 --> 00:26:57,526
So should I erase it?
- Yes.

254
00:26:58,244 --> 00:27:01,786
Yes, a person could be in a place,
or yes, I should erase it?

255
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,759
Erase it, Lucy. Next name, Harry.

256
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:09,658
Leo Johnson...
husband of Shelly, drives a truck,

257
00:27:09,658 --> 00:27:14,085
connection with Laura... unknown.

258
00:27:14,085 --> 00:27:15,764
Leo Johnson.

259
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,225
Little Audrey Horne just walked in.

260
00:27:55,528 --> 00:28:00,667
Yeah, I saw her at church.
Wonder what she's doing down here.

261
00:28:17,317 --> 00:28:21,456
Hi, Audrey.
- Hi, Norma. A cup of coffee, please.

262
00:28:24,802 --> 00:28:28,062
Remind me to get those 60 watt bulbs.

263
00:28:35,593 --> 00:28:37,591
Thanks.

264
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,649
I'm gonna go say hi.

265
00:29:02,567 --> 00:29:03,317
Hi.

266
00:29:04,197 --> 00:29:06,196
Hi, Donna.

267
00:29:10,262 --> 00:29:15,566
So my parents said they saw you
at church today. I didn't see you.

268
00:29:16,744 --> 00:29:18,706
I came by because of Laura.

269
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:23,849
What do you mean?
I didn't think you liked her.

270
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:26,904
There were things about Laura
I didn't like,

271
00:29:26,904 --> 00:29:29,956
but she did take care
of my brother Johnny.

272
00:29:29,956 --> 00:29:32,256
I loved her for that.

273
00:29:46,897 --> 00:29:48,978
Do you like coffee?

274
00:29:50,033 --> 00:29:52,995
Yeah, with cream and sugar.

275
00:29:56,557 --> 00:29:59,317
Agent Cooper loves coffee.

276
00:30:00,195 --> 00:30:02,277
Audrey!

277
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:12,061
But Agent Cooper
likes his coffee black.

278
00:30:18,597 --> 00:30:21,975
Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

279
00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:28,501
Did Laura ever talk about my father?

280
00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:33,021
What do you mean?

281
00:30:34,781 --> 00:30:36,613
Nothing.

282
00:30:36,613 --> 00:30:39,036
No, what do you mean?

283
00:30:42,561 --> 00:30:45,236
He used to sing to her.

284
00:30:50,506 --> 00:30:52,551
I love this music.

285
00:30:55,273 --> 00:30:57,903
Isn't it too dreamy?

286
00:31:44,776 --> 00:31:50,795
Hawk found this half a mile
down the tracks from the crime site.

287
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:56,689
It's a nasty piece of work.

288
00:32:00,826 --> 00:32:03,871
Tell Agent Cooper
that Albert and his team are here.

289
00:32:03,871 --> 00:32:05,711
Albert?
- A-l-b-e-r-t.

290
00:32:05,711 --> 00:32:09,182
Do we have to stand here all day?
- No.

291
00:32:09,182 --> 00:32:13,865
Albert Rosenfield.
R-o-s-e-n-f-i-e-l-d.

292
00:32:15,672 --> 00:32:17,671
Sheriff, this is Lucy.

293
00:32:17,671 --> 00:32:20,810
Is Agent Cooper with you?
- Yes, he is.

294
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:23,405
Are Albert and his team here, Lucy?

295
00:32:23,405 --> 00:32:27,087
Yes, he is... they are.
- We're on our way.

296
00:32:27,087 --> 00:32:30,968
Agent Cooper will be right with you.
- I can hear perfectly well, Curly.

297
00:32:32,904 --> 00:32:37,245
Albert and his team are cream
of the crop. Albert's a forensics genius.

298
00:32:37,245 --> 00:32:39,668
I wouldn't expect anything less.

299
00:32:39,668 --> 00:32:44,108
But I got to warn you, Albert's lacking
in some of the social niceties.

300
00:32:44,108 --> 00:32:47,491
Nobody's perfect.
- Isn't that the truth?

301
00:32:55,109 --> 00:32:58,488
What kind of a two-bit operation
are they running here?

302
00:32:58,488 --> 00:33:00,912
Albert, this is Sheriff Truman.

303
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:05,522
I've seen some slipshod backwater
burgs, but this place takes the cake.

304
00:33:05,522 --> 00:33:08,146
What are you waiting for? Christmas?

305
00:33:08,146 --> 00:33:12,630
They're putting this girl in ground tomorrow,
and we've wasted half the day getting here.

306
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:15,476
I suggest you and your team
should get started.

307
00:33:15,476 --> 00:33:18,938
I'll have one of my men
escort you over to the morgue.

308
00:33:18,938 --> 00:33:21,659
Results from the local
pathologist's report.

309
00:33:25,263 --> 00:33:28,356
Welcome to Amateur Hour.

310
00:33:30,157 --> 00:33:32,867
Looks like an all-nighter, boys.

311
00:33:32,867 --> 00:33:36,051
Albert, got a minute?

312
00:33:39,732 --> 00:33:42,527
I hear that you're real good
at what you do.

313
00:33:42,527 --> 00:33:44,658
That's correct.
- That's good.

314
00:33:44,658 --> 00:33:48,794
'Cause normally if a stranger walked
into my station talking this crap,

315
00:33:48,794 --> 00:33:54,023
he'd be looking for his teeth
two blocks up on Queer Street.

316
00:34:12,771 --> 00:34:15,233
Good night, Ed!

317
00:34:19,797 --> 00:34:23,306
Ed, is that you?
- Yeah, honey, it's me.

318
00:34:25,819 --> 00:34:29,696
Ed!
- Oh, my God.

319
00:34:33,348 --> 00:34:37,570
Oh, Ed, I'm so happy, sweetheart,
I have to thank you.

320
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:38,986
Why's that?

321
00:34:38,986 --> 00:34:41,581
You don't know
what you've done for me.

322
00:34:41,581 --> 00:34:46,094
No, I don't.
- Oh, Ed, you big lug!

323
00:34:46,094 --> 00:34:49,188
When you tracked that grease
into the house today,

324
00:34:49,188 --> 00:34:52,992
you spilled some on my cotton balls.

325
00:34:52,992 --> 00:34:58,303
But instead of tossing them out,
I put the greased ones on the runners.

326
00:34:58,303 --> 00:35:02,954
And Ed...just listen to this.

327
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:14,704
Completely silent.

328
00:35:15,627 --> 00:35:19,254
How about that?
- Oh, Ed...

329
00:35:19,254 --> 00:35:23,228
We're gonna be so rich!

330
00:35:32,522 --> 00:35:35,448
Everything smells like fish
around here.

331
00:35:36,371 --> 00:35:39,664
Well, you could wash
your socks separately.

332
00:35:40,929 --> 00:35:44,223
What did that FBI man want
up here today?

333
00:35:44,223 --> 00:35:49,331
Very nice fellow.
Asked a few questions.

334
00:35:49,331 --> 00:35:51,250
About what?

335
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:54,471
Well, he talked to Josie mostly.

336
00:35:54,471 --> 00:35:58,065
I had a problem with a fish.

337
00:35:58,065 --> 00:36:01,995
Took a liking to my percolator.

338
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:05,391
What did he want
to talk to Josie about?

339
00:36:05,391 --> 00:36:07,643
Why don't you ask her?

340
00:36:14,177 --> 00:36:17,270
Here's the key, the ledger's inside.

341
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:19,976
Thank you.
- You betcha.

342
00:36:27,015 --> 00:36:28,679
Didn't he ask for me?

343
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:31,490
Yeah, but we said
you were on a world tour

344
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,864
he should contact your press agent.

345
00:36:35,128 --> 00:36:38,720
Get your boots off my bed
and go to your room!

346
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:51,145
I didn't want to get mink oil
on my bedspread.

347
00:36:57,168 --> 00:36:59,845
You got mink oil in your head.

348
00:37:24,268 --> 00:37:26,266
Two books.

349
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:53,884
Leland...

350
00:38:53,884 --> 00:38:57,269
Leland, stop it!
- We have to dance, Sarah.

351
00:38:57,269 --> 00:38:59,908
We have to dance for Laura.

352
00:38:59,908 --> 00:39:03,588
Leland, stop it! Give it to me.
- We have to dance!

353
00:39:03,588 --> 00:39:06,091
Leland! Leland, give it to me!

354
00:39:19,108 --> 00:39:21,106
What is going on?

355
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:33,942
Leland! What is going on
in this house?

356
00:39:36,338 --> 00:39:38,670
Oh, God!

357
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:38,645
Laura, Laura!

358
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,322
Laura!

359
00:40:51,113 --> 00:40:55,336
"Through the darkness of future past,

360
00:40:55,336 --> 00:40:59,132
"the magician longs to see,

361
00:40:59,132 --> 00:41:05,489
"one chance out
between two worlds...

362
00:41:05,489 --> 00:41:09,341
"fire, walk with me."

363
00:41:10,225 --> 00:41:13,685
We lived among the people.

364
00:41:13,685 --> 00:41:18,168
I think you say, convenience store.

365
00:41:19,969 --> 00:41:22,383
We lived above it.

366
00:41:23,524 --> 00:41:27,199
I mean it like it is,
like it sounds.

367
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:33,428
l, too, have been touched
by the devilish one.

368
00:41:33,428 --> 00:41:36,481
Tattoo on the left shoulder.

369
00:41:37,743 --> 00:41:42,215
Oh, but when I saw the face of God,

370
00:41:42,215 --> 00:41:44,508
I was changed.

371
00:41:45,647 --> 00:41:48,227
I took the entire arm off.

372
00:41:49,704 --> 00:41:55,223
My name is Mike. His name is Bob.

373
00:41:55,223 --> 00:41:56,473
Mike?

374
00:41:58,403 --> 00:42:01,662
Mike, can you hear me?

375
00:42:04,843 --> 00:42:09,101
"Catch you with my Death Bag."

376
00:42:09,101 --> 00:42:13,415
You may think I've gone insane.

377
00:42:13,415 --> 00:42:16,046
But I promise...

378
00:42:17,055 --> 00:42:20,814
I will kill again!

379
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,505
But it... it is Laura Palmer.

380
00:44:37,405 --> 00:44:39,069
Are you Laura Palmer?

381
00:46:55,581 --> 00:46:58,042
Harry, it's Cooper.

382
00:46:58,042 --> 00:47:00,928
Meet me for breakfast,
7:00 am the hotel lobby.

383
00:47:00,928 --> 00:47:04,062
I know who killed Laura Palmer.

384
00:47:05,116 --> 00:47:08,827
No, it can wait till morning.
