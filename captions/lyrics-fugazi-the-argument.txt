On the morning of the first eviction
They carried out the wishes of the landlord and his son
Furniture's out on the sidewalk next to the family
That little piggie went to market
So they're kicking out everyone

Talking about process and dismissal
Forced removal of the people on the corner
Shelter and location
Everybody wants somewhere

The elected are such willing partners
Look who's buying all their tickets to the game
Development wants, development gets
It's official
Development wants this neighborhood gone
So the city just wants the same

Talking about process and dismissal
Forced removal of the people on the corner
Shelter and location
Everybody wants somewhere

Everybody wants somewhere, somewhere
Everybody wants somewhere, somewhere
Everybody wants somewhere, somewhere
Everybody wants somewhere, somewhere

Process and dismissal
Process and dismissal
Shelter and location
Everybody wants somewhere

Everybody wants somewhere, somewhere
Everybody wants somewhere, somewhere
Everybody wants somewhere, somewhere
Everybody wants

Moving silent like radar
Take me over
And blow out my mind now

Take me over

Wish I could be there
Stop
Tell me something that I don't know
Is there anything left to know?
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop

Accessory, accessory, accessory

I've got this epic problem
This epic problem's not a problem for me
And inside, I know I'm broken
But I'm working as far as you can see
I've got this epic problem
This epic problem's not a problem for me
And inside, I know I'm broken
But I'm working as far as you can see
And outside, it's all production
It's all illusion, set scenery
I've got this epic problem
This epic problem's not a problem for me
When the bit pulls tight, the grip is sewn into the reins
Can't breathe it out, you'll just breathe it back again
Come mental-pack, your chambers full for no reason you can name
A boil-in-bag blood supply, you know it's murder on the veins
Oh don't you feel it now?

Viva, viva, viva, life and limb
Viva, viva, viva, threatening
Viva, viva, viva, life and limb
Viva, viva, viva, threatening

Hey, we want our violence doubled
(No, but really in a loving way)
Hey, we want our violence doubled
(No, but really want it right away)

The national temper, you know it's written on your face
Etched and scratched and mirrored back, don't you know it's all the rage?
Oh, don't you feel it now?

Viva, viva, viva, life and limb, I said
Viva, viva, viva, threatening, said

Hey, we want our violence doubled
(No, but really in a loving way)
Hey, we want our violence doubled
(No, but really want it right away)
Right away

Hey, we want our violence doubled
(No, but really in a loving way)
Hey, we want our violence doubled
(No, but really want it right away)
Hey, we want our violence doubled
(No, but really in a loving way)
Hey, we want our violence doubled
(No, but really want it right away)
Born into race and nation
Accept family and obligation
I'm not a citizen, I'm not a citizen

Embrace tradition and occupation
Cull memory for assimilation
Secure for future generations
Secure for future generations
I'm not a citizen, I'm not a citizen
I'm not a citizen, I'm not a citizen

Laying in this cold field
Waiting for the call
Feeling right here in this uniform
I think I got them all

Academic or street education
Obtain degree in annihilation
I'm not a citizen, I'm not a citizen
I'm not a citizen, I'm not a citizen

Laying down in chambers
Waiting for the call
Seen your kind so many times
You got no chance at all

Laid out immobile
Hoping for that call
It's in my mouth, under my skin
Sodium pentathol
Sodium pentathol
Sodium pentathol
Sodium pentathol
The sun's a strange light
Nothing grows right anymore
Scars on every stalk
Whose mouth should I use to talk?

The force that marks the routine
Temperature whatever degrees
Create the bad thing
And lay our heads in it

Now it's hard to punch the clock
On the site where production stopped
I'm a warehouse filled with junk
Some somethings for some someones

Tacking time with tracking eye
Tectonic shifts one nerve at a time
I lay my head in it

A hundred plans to fortify
Beige concrete goes on for miles
Hiding cities under it
Fill my mouth with with non-mouth spit
There was a light at the window
A light under the door
But it's not there anymore

Come on over
Come on over
Get your shoes on
Put your feet on, baby
Come on over
Get your shoes on
Put your feet on, baby
Get your shoes on
Put your feet on, baby
Come on over
Get your shoes on
Put your feet on, baby
Come on over
Number one in acquisitions
There is no foreign soil
Go global like a round thing
Go global like a hole
Every money matchmaker
Splicing green as fast as you can
Let's break it down and start again

Memo to the partners
I'm changing all the locks
I'm pissing on your modems
I'm shredding all the stocks
Choose a color for your ceiling
I'm waiting for the bottom to drop
In a room so brightly lit
I can't see in, no, no, no

You would never say you were out of time
Your secret is out
Coming with the fiction all the time
Your secret is out
But there's a call coming on the other line
Your secret is out
It's out now, oh yeah

La-la lapse of luxury
La-la-lapping waste
Cruising towards a bruising crash
Thread held anvil's gonna break
When the letter returns to the sender
I can't hardly wait
God, this room's so brightly lit
I can't see shit, no, no, no

You would never say you were out of time
Your secret is out
Coming with the fiction all the time
Your secret is out
But there's a call coming on the other line
Your secret is out
It's out now, it's out yeah

Thank you, may I have another?
I would be your eager driver
Your service provider, your maitre d'
Thank you, may I have another?
I would be your eager driver
Your service provider, your maitre d'
Like a wind up, shaking, shaking partner

Thank you, sir, may I have another?
Thank you, sir, may I have another?
Thank you, sir, may I have another?
Please
Looking out for cars and mortality
Trying to find some sort of geometry
Avoiding mistakes
Keep an eye on every step I take

Everything is building and it appears
That you're all architects and engineers
That's how it looks
That's how it looks from here

I'm an ex-spectator
Can't you see?
I'm an ex-spectator
Never let my
Never let my
Never let my
Never let my vision
Get in the way of...

Here's some questions that the writer sent
Can an observer be a participant?
Have I seen too much?
Does it count if it doesn't touch?

If the view is all I can ascertain
Pure understanding is out of range
If I make that call
Why can't I make that change?

I'm an ex-spectator
Can't you see?
I'm an ex-spectator
Never let my
Never let my
Never let my
Never let my vision
Get in the way of me
Fuck your fucked directives
God I want a new invective
Custom built to form
Form fit you
Say it to your face
If I get to choose

I'll take something real
The fight to feel
While your next meal is calling
Loosely trademarked as the best
Fucking thing you've ever had

Inside your mouth
All comet cleaned and scrubbed down
Landscaping for a ghost town
While that deficient platform for your head
Causing you to mistake yourself for dead

All that you would issue
Is capital's incontinence
Is it causing you embarrassment?
The wet spot on the carpet that you leave
As the reminder that you need

Of all that it did to you
Adjusting your reception
A welcome self correction
Oh, make it quick, make it soon
Make it something I can do
All by myself

'Cause there's a brain inside it
And there's a brain deciding
And there's a brain inside the brain
There's a brain inside the brain
Deciding

Find something else [?]

It's time to make or break
Find me somewhere else

Time to make or break
How 'bout it?

I've got no patience
I'm nowhere stationed
I'm hanging at the nightshop eating shit

Said I've got no patience
I'm nowhere stationed
I'm hanging at the nightshop eating shit

"Who works for who?", every asshole says
Side saluting emptiness instead
But if I get to choose I'll take something real

Who works for who, who you working for?
Who works for who, who you working for?
When they start falling
Executions will commence
Sides will not matter now
Matter makes no sense
How did a difference
Become a disease?
I'm sure you have reasons
A rational defence
Weapons and motives
Bloody fingerprints
But I can't help thinking
It's still all disease

Here comes the argument
Here comes the argument
Here comes the argument
Folderol

It's all about strikes now
So here's what's striking me
That some punk could argue
Some moral ABC's
When people are catching
What bombers release
I'm on a mission
To never agree

Here comes the argument
Here comes the argument
Here comes the argument
Here comes the argument
Here it comes
