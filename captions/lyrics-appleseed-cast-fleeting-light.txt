Tear down the gates.
Any where the [?] come.
Who is defied.
Ocean, wave or mountain.
That takes it's final toll.

In time, wind conquers down to us.
Waves, who've spoken our names disappear.
We're first inside there.
Or else the sea will hold.

Take back your names.
Break the spell of dreaming.
And put your feet to the path.
Be filled with awe.
Remember all the love you'll bring.
Carry it with you through the storm.

In time, wind conquers down to us.
Waves, who've spoken our names disappear.
We're first inside there.
Or else the sea will hold.

Now we come out chaotic waves.
Now we come out chaotic waves.
Now we come out chaotic waves.
Now we come out chaotic waves.
Ice to fire of your brethren.
You're all I see.
Ice to fire of your brethren.
You're all I see.

No one can say where the [?].
Next to the ground.

We're blasting out through the atmosphere.
We aren't staying here, [?].

Ice to fire of your brethren.
You're all I see.
Ice to fire of your brethren.
You're all I-
Wake up, you'll see.
The sun is rising over us.
And it's time to leave.

We've got one day to give.
One day to work and live.
And hold the world as it changes.

The destroyer.
The destroyer.

Wake up, you'll see.
A million years ago.
Waking up the darkness.

And as the stars are fleeting.
We are pulled to greeting.
Finding love beneath it in it's time.

The destroyer.
The destroyer.

Wake up, you'll see.
The sun is rising over us.
It's time to leave.

We've got one day to give.
One day to work and live.
And hold the world as it changes.

The destroyer.
The destroyer.
We were waiting.
Circles in the air.
We were holding a line.
And you're rushing home.

All the doors are closed.
If I said I can.
There will be no silence.
No redemption.

We’re crawling along what I thought was traction.
We're crawling along what I thought was traction.
We're crawling along.

All those [?].
But the [?].
But the [?].
I’m hitting a wall, yeah.
I'm hitting a wall, [?].

We were waiting.
Circles in the air.
We were holding a line.
And you're rushing home.

All the doors are closed.
If I said I can.
There will be no silence.
No redemption.

We're crawling along what I thought was traction.
We're crawling along what I thought was traction.
Now I get the lesson.
Of the words that my father said.
Life ain't easy.
But if you do it right, it’s worth it.

You've got to watch your back.
And take care of those with less than you.
No one goes alone.
The carnivores are bigger than all of us.

Do not worry.
Where would you carry extra [baggage?].
Never lose the fire.
You're gonna need it on this journey.
I'm hoping I feel a way on a stage.
In a home that’s feeling the [?].
I know I'm not perfect, it's clear, I failed.
It could feel like a Red December.

I’m hoping I feel a way on a stage.
In a home that's feeling the [?].

Cold friend.
You seem to know again.
The four hearts.
All the cards in your deck.

The sun is gray.
Hoping for your soon return.
The sun will raise.
You will know the girls dancing.

You started making yourself up.
We stand there waiting for sunlight.
You and I will save the fire.

You and I.
You and I will save the fire.
Break, roll down inside.
Break, welcome to try.

You're not old.
You will shake your skin undone.
You will take your old eyes and wake.
Roll down inside.

Calm in the night.
You are young.
You will take your walls along.
You will take your words and turn to rain.

Go on inside.
Roll up the sky.
You are young.
No matter where your heart moves on.
You will know your worlds are ok.

Go on outside.
All fun aside.
Since you are one.
And I love you’re just the sun.
And I love you're just the sun.

Reaching the forest.
We are the edge of everything.
Reaching the forest.
We are the edge of everything.
Reaching the forest.
We are the edge of everything.
Reaching the forest.
We are the edge of everything.
Reaching the forest.
We are the edge of everything.
Reaching the forest.
We are the edge of everything.
