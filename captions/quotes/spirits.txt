There are no second chances at life.
Is that all?""That's all there is
There is love and everyone can love.
A thousand faces I saw in you.
You make my heart beat faster than the speed of light.
Time stopped in the last time I saw you.
My love is infinite.
I fell in love with you and I saw the light.
My love for you will always exist.
We are in love; I saw my face in yours.
Our love is a wonder.
She's a miracle.
It's obvious, I have a crush on you.
Ghosts are the manifestation of the longing of loss.
Keep your spirits high and voice low.
It's your spirit I love.
The signs tell me you’re the one.
The butterfly fetched butterflies in our chest.
The butterfly doesn’t lie.
Our eyes met and the cloudy sky filled with light.
I loved you and the next day I saw a rainbow.
Love burnt us and the world got on fire.
The love we feel is not meant for days like this.
I'm in a strange circle of love.
I passed by your place, but I didn't get in.
I love you like I have never loved before.
You and me and the butterfly.
I hear you whispering, "Will she come?
Maybe you have something to say to me.
She will tell you how I feel for you.
I loved you, because we are the same.
Whether you're angel or demon I'm in love.
I tried to tell you our love is cursed.
Some things were just meant to be drunk,
He would gaze at her with intrigued longan seed eyes.
An altar is like an airport where spirits take off and land
we are all strangers / bound by the same spirits
Not all heroes die in armor.
Believe that you are someone worth saving.
There is no place so dark that light cannot lead the way.
The spirits of children are remote and wise...
An intelligent woman with allies can accomplish anything
