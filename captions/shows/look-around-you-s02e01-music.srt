And now on BBC2, a look at
the world of science and technology

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,638
with a new series
of Look Around You.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,790
(DJ) And now let's take a look
at this week's Top 10.

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,470
At No.10, it's Jonathan Silverstein
with Punky Bar Mitzvah.

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,638
The Emerald Sisters are at 9
with Botched Operation.

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,832
At 8, it's The Nuts
with Black Thatcher.

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,671
The outrageous Marigold's at No.7
this week with Romeo And Julian.

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,394
At No.6, everyone's favourite
pensioner, Grandad,

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,591
with The Good Old Days. Aw.

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,839
At No.5, it's Imhotep
with Hurts Like Crazy.

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,793
And Corville Bedford
spends his 60th week at No.4

13
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,240
with Nuclear Winter.

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,636
No.3 this week is cancelled.

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,354
And his second entry
in the Top 10 at No.2,

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,392
Grandad with Freudian Slip.

17
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,434
Which means that this week's No.1
is, yes, you've guessed it,

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,120
Jack Morgan with Little Mouse.

No, you haven't gone mad.

20

This is Look Around You and that was
Top Of The Pops from two years ago,

21
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,753
when our very own Jack Morgan
had a No.1 single with Little Mouse.

26

Jack took a year off from presenting
to concentrate on his music

27
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,880
and scored a worldwide hit
with this song,

28
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,072
which was inspired
by a vermin infestation.

We've got a very special show
for you tonight,

32
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,519
because Jack will be performing his
follow-up single here in the studio.

33
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,155
That's because tonight's programme

34
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,113
is about the world
and the future of music.

35
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,594

What music will be listening to
in the year 2000?

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,909
Will we still be enjoying
pop music like Jack Morgan,

00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,397
or classical, like the operas
of Bach or Mozhoven?

Well, that's the question we asked
you in the Radio Times recently.

44
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,953
And we set you a challenge,
to come up with what you think

but unfortunately we only
had time to listen to a few of them

51
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,032
and we've chosen the three acts
that we feel come closest

52
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,232
to predicting the musical styles
of the year 2000.

53

And they're here with us tonight.

And they are...

55
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,309

of winning the music 2000 prize

Judging their performances tonight

58
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,392
is somebody who knows
a lot about music.

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,559
In fact, he's even been
described as a musical genius.

pleasure to be on the BBC tonight

70
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,477
and great privilege
to be judging music 2000 contest.

but also a timelessness.

Well, Tchaikovsky,
you've certainly got star quality.

83
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,472
And we hope you enjoy
our three musical guests,

84
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,720
starting with Tony Rudd,
who is a music teacher from Bristol.

85
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,120
Hello, Tony.
Welcome to Look Around You.

86
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,836
Tony, tell us a little bit about
the piece you're going to perform.

87
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,352
I got quite a lot of help
from some of my pupils

88
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,519
and incidentally, I'd like to give
a big wave to everybody in class 4/4

89
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,756
at St Cerberus Comprehensive.

90
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,396
Erm...we thought long and hard

91
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,957
and we decided to look
at current trends in music

92
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,993
and extrapolate from that

93
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:24,115
what we imagined would be
the most futuristic music possible.

94
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,756
Erm...so hopefully
that's what we've come up with.

95
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,194
So...Tony Rudd,
you now have 30 seconds

96
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,234
to give us your music 2000.

Ooh, thank you.

117
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,432
You might be forgiven for thinking
we have a real-live orchestra here

118
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,915
but in actual fact
the symphony you just heard

119
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,191
was performed not by an orchestra

120
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,232
but by a simple synthesizer.

121
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,910
And the man who programmed it
is someone who loves

122
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,080
synthesisers so much he even changed
his name to Synthesizer Patel.

123

124

- Hello, Synthesizer Patel.
- Hi, Pealy.

126
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,715
Synthesizer Patel, synthesizers
are really taking off, aren't they?

127
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,356
Oh, yes, Pealy. Every pop group
wants a synthesizer these days

128
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,553
because a synthesizer can reproduce
the sound of any instrument,

129
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,957
except perhaps for the bassoon
but they're working on that one.

130
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,356
But they can do more
than that, can't they?

131
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,632
Oh, certainly. This is something
that might interest you.

132
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,074
OK, so what I did earlier was
I made recording of my own voice

133
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,476
- using this microphone.
- Mm-hm.

134
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,070
And I stored that data into
the synthesizer's memory banks.

135
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,191
And now here is the fun bit.

136
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,232
I can play back to you.

(Piercing alarm)

143
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,358
In fact, they all come
with burglar alarms these days,

144
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,153
because crime's so bloody bad

145
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,352
and these bastards, they steal
your synthesizers and er...

146
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,960
- Yes, it's a shame.
- Yes, it is a shame.

147
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,639
Now, Synthesizer Patel,

148
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,832
synthesizers come in all sorts
of shapes and sizes.

149
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,679
This one here, for instance,
looks like a calculator.

150
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,871
Ah. That is quite right, Pealy.

151
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,072
That is because it is
a calculating synthesizer.

152
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,670
It is similar to the one used by
the Chancellor of the Exchequer

153
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,473
in his recent musical budget.

154
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,552
So it's ideal for anyone
who loves music and maths?

155
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,480
Exactly and there is security lock
here for extra security,

156
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,399
because synthesizers
are so expensive and...

157
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,559
Now, Synthesizer Patel, I've never
seen an instrument like this before.

158
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,037
- That looks like water.
- It is indeed water, Pealy.

159
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,279
The water makes it easier for the
hands to move around over the keys.

160
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,960
It also makes the music sound
smoother.

161
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,434
Listen.

162
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,870

Gosh, that's lovely.

164
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,158
If anyone tries to steal it,
the water becomes electrified

165
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,998
and they receive a nasty surprise.

166
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,680
Well, Synthesizer Patel,
thank you very much

167
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,997
for enlightening us on
the wonderful world of synthesizers.

168
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,953
They really are amazing devices,
aren't they?

169
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,993
Synthesizer Patel, you mentioned
earlier the bassoon.

170
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,192
When do you think a synthesizer
will be able to imitate one?

171
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,197
Realistically? Never.

172
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,836
The bassoon is such a particular
instrument with such a unique sound,

173
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,031
I don't think they'll ever
approximate it.

174
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,878
Certainly not in my lifetime.

175
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,072
I suppose that's good news
for all you bassoonists out there.

176
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,794
Don't go throwing away
your bassoons just yet.

178
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,913
Synthesizer Patel, you're going to
play something we should recognise.

179
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,758
That's right.

Toni, as a physicist,
what do you think life will be like

191
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,680
in the year 2000?

so do stick around

220

and thank you once again
for your performance, Toni Baxter.

221
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,552
Have you ever wondered
how the pop charts are compiled?

222
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,876
Well, every time you buy a record,

223
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,435
the record shop owner
immediately notifies

224
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,676
the people who put
the charts together,

225
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,951
the Royal Pop and Rock Association,

226
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,310
using a system of pneumatic tubes.

227
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,750
Once it arrives at ROPRA,
the sale is logged

228
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,680
and that information
is used to calculate the positions

229
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,552
of the songs in the charts.

230
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,150
However, the pneumatic tubes
themselves are pretty old

231
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,157
and often get clogged up.

232
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,672
Worse still, because so many other
businesses use this tube system,

233
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,360
the information
sometimes gets mixed up,

234
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,552
which can lead to
discrepancies in the charts.

235
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,557
We all remember last year's fiasco

236
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,072
when the Post Office tower spent
six consecutive weeks at No.1.

237
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,634
So in the words of Elvis Presley,
"Something had to be done."

238
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,071
And here at ROPRA's headquarters,
in London's West End,

239
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,112
something is being done.

240
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,151
Sir Alan Rees
is the chairman of ROPRA.

241
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,192
- (Knocking)
- Go out.

242
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,680
Sir Alan, what is being done?

243
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,713
Well, we're phasing out
the whole pneumatic tube system

244
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,752
because it's clearly not working.

245
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,156
As well as
the Post Office tower business,

246
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,795
we've had everything from a coat
hangar in the Top 10

247
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:11,039
to a motor insurance policy
popping in and out of the charts

248
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,753
and driving everybody mad.

249
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,191
Erm, so now,
when you buy a single, um...

250
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,557
- it will look like that.
- What's that little box?

251
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,072
That is actually a transmitting
device that's built into the record.

252
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,796
So as soon as you place the needle
on to the groove of the record,

253
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,277
it sends out an electronic signal
to our central computer,

254
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,439
which registers the details of the
record, the name of the pop act,

255
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,472
the song, umcetera, umcetera

256
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,992
and from that we can completely
accurately produce the um...charts.

257
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,157
So, Sir Alan,
what's to stop an artist

258
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,874
from playing their record
again and again,

259
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,480
sending out multiple signals
to your computer

260
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,796
in a bid to drive
their record up the charts?

261
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,036
Well, we've um,
thought of that, Pam.

262
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,879
From now on, when you buy a record,

263
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,912
you will only be able
to listen to it once.

264
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,950
I see.

265
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,993
After that,
if you do try to play it again...

266
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,351
um...it will sound like this.

267
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:16,796
This record has been erased.
(Bleep) This record has been erased.

268

(Bleep)
This record has been erased. (Bleep)

269
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,032
And um...

270
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,120
Now the record is totally useless.

271
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,753
That's amazing.

272
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,679
Well, Sir Alan is not only
an expert on records,

273
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,871
he's also a record holder.

274
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:38,796
Um...that's right, Pam. I currently
hold the record for French kissing.

275
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,231
- So, could I have a demonstration?
- Certainly.

276
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,272
Um...

277
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,438
Well, that certainly
topped my charts.

278
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,472

the secret to a good profiterole?

284
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,112

289
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,354
Well, there's a new type of music

290
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,040
that's emerged
from the streets of America,

291
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,640
where people talk over the music.

292
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,878
- They talk over the music?
- Yes and the rhythm.

293
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,709
- And it's known as rap music.
- Rap music?

294
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,276
Yes and I definitely think
we'll be listening to rap music

in the year 2000.

296
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,958
Well, this is a first for me

- ♪ I'm rapping to the beat... ♪

312
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,797
Well done. That was fantastic.

313
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,392
And thank you for introducing
us all to the world of rap music.

314
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,433
Well, we've seen
all three contestants tonight

315
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,917
but which one will be walking away
with a recording contract?

316
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,952
Find out after this.

317
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,152
(Upbeat disco music)

318
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,356
We've all heard of disco damage,

319
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,872
the harm caused to our ears
through excessively loud music.

320
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,116
That's enough now, thank you.

321
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,356
I said that's enough now, thank you.

322
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,960
- (Music stops)
- Phew, that's better.

323
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,516
If we think of our ears
as this crystal glass...

324
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,472
(High-pitched note)

325
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,712
..we can being to understand
the immense power of sound

326
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,151
and realise just how fragile
our ears actually are.

327
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,793
Thanks, Pam.

328
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,196
(Deep bass note)

329
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,878
You're good at that.

330
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,718
So what can be done about it?

331
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,320
Short of writing to
your MP about noise levels

332
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,397
or picketing your local discotheque,

333
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,477
there's nothing much
we really can do.

334
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,512
But now there may be an answer

335
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,359
and it comes, surprisingly,
in a can.

336
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,711
Psilence, so its maker claims,

337
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,039
can reduce all external sounds
by up to 100 per cent.

338
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,832
So let's meet its maker,
inventor Leonard Hatred.

339
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,672
(Shoes squeak)

340
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,920
Hello, Leonard,
and welcome to Look Around You.

341
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,591
Leonard, you've been rather followed
around by noise all your life.

342
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,236
That's right.
When I lived with my parents,

343
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,069
erm...they were both great snorers

344
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,239
and er...I've always been
a light sleeper.

345
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,990
Erm...so they caused me
a lot of annoyments.

346
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,190
I see.

347
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:33,237
And also we lived in Heathrow,
erm...which wasn't marvellous.

348
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,078
We moved to another house

349
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,591
and that was unfortunately
Gatwick... (Laughs nervously)

350
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,677
..which wasn't an improvement.

351
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,154
No, I suppose not, no.

352
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,160
When I got married, we moved
to the countryside and er...

353
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,832
they proceeded to build an abattoir
directly opposite the house.

354
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,840
So it was the constant noise
of dying cows,

355
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,271
which was the er...the final straw.

356
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,075
And I understand that your wife
suffers from a condition

357
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,476
that causes her
to scream incessantly.

358
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,992
That's right and her sister
has moved in with us also.

359
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,431
- And she...
- She has the same condition. Yes.

360
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,269
So I suppose
that's a noisy household.

361
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,392
So I suppose it was the culmination
of all these things

362
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,559
that led you to create your noise
reduction spray Psilence.

363
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,752
And you're going
to demonstrate it for us now.

364
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,476
Now, Leonard, can you tell me
what does your spray contain?

365
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,796
It's obviously a secret formula

366
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,912
but I can reveal
that it contains liquid skin.

367
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,553
- Mm-hm.
- Hold still.

368
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,239
OK.

369
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,036
Oh. Ah. That's very cold.

370
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,753
It'Il dry off in a minute.

371
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,352
Now, er, I can't hear
anything out of this ear.

372
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,392
No. Can you see that?

373
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,073
Nothing at all.

374
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,112
Let's do the other ear.

375
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,072
It's cold.

376
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,512
Now, ah... Ah... Ah...

377
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,873
(Loudly) Well, erm, both of my ears
are now completely sealed.

378
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,912
And erm...

379
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,193
Er, this is odd. I can't even...
I can't hear anything.

380
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,039
I can't even hear
the sound of my own voice.

381
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,640
Psilence will be going
through to the final

382
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,718
of our Look Around You Invention
of the Year Competition

383
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,879
and Leonard Hatred could be walking
away with this magnificent trophy,

384
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,718
presented at the end of the series

385
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,878
by His Royal Highness,
Sir Prince Charles.

386
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,912
And here's your rosette.

387
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,431
(Electronic voice) Music 2000.

388
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,955
Well, it's decision time
for music 2000.

389
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,596
I've just picked the last bit
of Psilence out of my ears.

390
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,919
So before our judge, the ghost of
Tchaikovsky, gives us the result,

391
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,556
let's first remind ourselves
of our three acts.

392
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,234
First of all we had Tony Rudd
with Machadaynu.

393
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,555
Then we saw Toni Baxter
with her entry, Sexual Interface.

394
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:41,755
And finally, Antony Carmichael
with The Rapping Song.

395
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,916
I think you'll agree
we could be listening

396
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,316
to any one of those songs
in the year 2000.

397
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,512
- Absolutely.
- Terrific. Very impressive, chaps.

398
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,712
However, there can be
only one winner.

399
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,752
- So, Tchaikovsky...
- Tchaikovsky.

400
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,440
..could you now please
tell us who that is?

401
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,632
(Speak Russian)

402
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,036
I talk. I talk.

403
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,912
Here... (Clears throat)

404
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,400
(Strong Russian accent)
Thank you very much.

405
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:16,999
Ten years ago...
I judge similar contestizion...

406
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,999
called music 1990.

407
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,200
Same standard was good.

408
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:33,233
But today standard much bigger.

409
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,272
And so...

410
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,439
It give me great...

411
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,278
- (Speaks Russian)
- (Whispers)

412
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:48,318
..bosoms to present music 2000 prize

413
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,352
to...

414
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,998
Toni...

415
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,593
Baxter.

416
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,632
(Cymbal crashes)

417
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,672
Well done.

418
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,712
Congratulations, Toni.

419
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,311
Congratulations. So, Toni, how does
it feel to have won music 2000?

420
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,358
I don't know.

421
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,237
I really don't know.

422
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,399
Well, here's your prize,
a professional recording contract,

423
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:27,232
which comes into effect on
January the 1st, 2000. Well done.

424
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,960
Yes, congratulations, indeed, Toni,

425
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,993
and we look forward to hearing
your music in the future.

426
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,636
And, of course, commiserations
to our other contestants.

427
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,273
(Muted applause)

428
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:47,317
And thank you once again to our
judge, the ghost of Tchaikovsky.

429
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,352
Thanks, Tchaikovsky.

430
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,473
Thankovsky.

431
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,873
Well, next week one of us
will be having plastic surgery

432
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,718
here on the programme,

433
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:04,231
as we take a look at the world
and the future of health.

434
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,040
But now it's the moment
we've all been waiting for.

435
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,676
Look Around You's Jack Morgan
performing his latest single.

436
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,713
So, from all of us here at
Shepherd's Bush, good night

437
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,116
and take it away, Jack!
