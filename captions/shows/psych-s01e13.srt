1
00:00:03,035 --> 00:00:04,127
<i>B4.</i>

2
00:00:04,837 --> 00:00:06,805
Miss. A7.

3
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:08,531
Hit.

4
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:10,333
D9.

5
00:00:10,876 --> 00:00:12,002
Miss.

6
00:00:12,378 --> 00:00:13,402
B6.

7
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:15,705
Hit.

8
00:00:16,749 --> 00:00:18,717
Shawn!
What?

9
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:24,747
Hey!

10
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,352
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

11
00:00:27,353 --> 00:00:28,483
Knock it off.
Knock it off!

12
00:00:28,484 --> 00:00:30,186
What the heck
is going on here?

13
00:00:30,187 --> 00:00:31,956
Mr. Spencer, your
son's been cheating.

14
00:00:31,957 --> 00:00:34,965
Have not! Are, too! You
hit my ships every time.

15
00:00:34,966 --> 00:00:36,763
Both of you,
on your feet, now.

16
00:00:38,137 --> 00:00:40,331
Best friends do not accuse
each other of cheating.

17
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:44,171
Best friends do not resort to fighting
every time they have an argument.

18
00:00:44,172 --> 00:00:46,608
You both know that I have a
partner on the force, right?

19
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:47,770
Yes, sir.

20
00:00:47,771 --> 00:00:51,247
Well, we couldn't do our job if we
didn't trust each other completely.

21
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:53,174
There are rules
to a partnership,

22
00:00:53,175 --> 00:00:55,014
and they are the same rules
for a friendship.

23
00:00:55,015 --> 00:00:56,485
Even Battleship.

24
00:00:56,486 --> 00:00:59,318
But those rules don't work
without what?

25
00:00:59,319 --> 00:01:00,722
Trust, sir.

26
00:01:01,026 --> 00:01:02,516
That's right.

27
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:08,496
Shawn! Over here now.

28
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:12,959
Why aren't there any of
your ships on the board?

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,368
I knew it!

30
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:16,269
Cheating? You're grounded.

31
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,330
But, Dad!

32
00:01:17,331 --> 00:01:22,210
And for the next two months, you
are gonna play with one less piece.

33
00:01:22,414 --> 00:01:23,675
But that's not fair.

34
00:01:23,676 --> 00:01:26,274
Exactly, Shawn. Now you
know what it feels like.

35
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,482
Shawn, I can't just
give you a case

36
00:01:33,483 --> 00:01:35,958
because Gus is out of town
this weekend and you're lonely.

37
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:40,124
Fine, maybe together we can figure
out how I can be less lonely.

38
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:42,593
Wait, I'm getting
something.

39
00:01:43,669 --> 00:01:44,931
Baby oil.

40
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:49,429
This is a photo
from about a year ago.

41
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,339
Oh, thank you.

42
00:01:52,144 --> 00:01:54,169
And this is
from last week.

43
00:01:55,481 --> 00:01:58,938
Thank you. We'll call you if we
turn anything up on her, Mr. Sirtis.

44
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:01,885
I appreciate your help,
Chief. Our pleasure.

45
00:02:02,454 --> 00:02:04,580
I'm telling you, I can
make the time, Chief.

46
00:02:04,581 --> 00:02:06,020
Your plate is full,
Detective.

47
00:02:06,021 --> 00:02:07,819
I already pulled
the old file.

48
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,655
If any of your
other cases suffer,

49
00:02:09,656 --> 00:02:12,253
then I will yank you
right off of this...

50
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:16,830
Spencer, what the hell
are you doing?

51
00:02:16,831 --> 00:02:18,459
Trying something.

52
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:22,097
I feel conventional vision
is weakening my skills.

53
00:02:22,098 --> 00:02:23,195
Is that my scarf?

54
00:02:23,196 --> 00:02:24,367
I...

55
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,734
I'm getting serviced.

56
00:02:27,713 --> 00:02:31,171
Return service.
No, a net.

57
00:02:32,985 --> 00:02:34,646
Fishnet? No!

58
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:38,149
I love somebody.

59
00:02:39,858 --> 00:02:41,758
Now I'm getting Grecian
Formula. That's weird.

60
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,658
It's not about what's there,
it's about what's missing.

61
00:02:46,965 --> 00:02:48,626
Tennis equipment.

62
00:02:50,657 --> 00:02:54,569
No, a tennis player
is missing.

63
00:02:57,142 --> 00:02:59,007
Björn Borg is missing!

64
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:01,169
No.

65
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,207
Who's missing?

66
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:06,148
Congratulations, Mr. Spencer.
You've just joined the case.

67
00:03:06,149 --> 00:03:08,310
What?
We can all pitch in.

68
00:03:08,311 --> 00:03:12,379
Deanna Sirtis was supposed to meet her
father Leonard at the airport last night.

69
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,153
They were flying to Tokyo for a
tournament but she never showed up.

70
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:17,991
The last time anyone saw her was
at tennis practice that morning.

71
00:03:22,935 --> 00:03:24,663
Has anyone checked out
her stalker?

72
00:03:24,664 --> 00:03:25,997
Felix Alvarez?

73
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:29,164
We're looking into him, since we know
he broke into her house a few months ago.

74
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:30,867
But what we need
from you now

75
00:03:30,868 --> 00:03:32,967
is to psychically locate
Deanna

76
00:03:32,968 --> 00:03:35,274
while we follow leads
using conventional methods.

77
00:03:35,275 --> 00:03:37,314
You mean, Lassy and I
can work together?

78
00:03:37,315 --> 00:03:38,507
Yeah, but separate.

79
00:03:38,508 --> 00:03:39,982
Should we synchronize
our watches?

80
00:03:39,983 --> 00:03:41,780
You're not wearing a
watch. That's a good point.

81
00:03:41,781 --> 00:03:44,481
Chief, I'd like to put in a
requisition order for a new watch.

82
00:03:44,482 --> 00:03:45,817
Lassy, can you
sign for that?

83
00:03:45,818 --> 00:03:47,016
All right, that's enough.

84
00:03:47,017 --> 00:03:50,220
Just... Now, let's go
do your jobs. All of you.

85
00:03:55,231 --> 00:03:56,289
Hey!

86
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:03,035
Thank you.

87
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:12,247
<i>I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth</i>

88
00:04:12,248 --> 00:04:15,308
<i>I know, you know
They just don't have any proof</i>

89
00:04:15,309 --> 00:04:18,617
<i>Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend</i>

90
00:04:18,618 --> 00:04:23,218
<i>Your worst inhibitions tend
to psych you out in the end</i>

91
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:31,535
Gus! Gus! Gus! Gus!

92
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:48,110
Hello?

93
00:04:48,111 --> 00:04:49,414
<i>Dude, how long
until you come back?</i>

94
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:50,476
We just got here.

95
00:04:50,477 --> 00:04:52,022
Yeah, but you can come home
during the weekend, right?

96
00:04:52,023 --> 00:04:53,181
<i>This is a weekend, Shawn.</i>

97
00:04:53,182 --> 00:04:54,918
It's a retreat,
with trust exercise

98
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,687
to build up a sense of
teamwork around the camp.

99
00:04:56,688 --> 00:04:58,422
Camp? You didn't say
you were camping.

100
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,225
Are you making S'mores?
Can I have some?

101
00:05:00,226 --> 00:05:02,732
Have you done "Who's Got My
Golden Arm" yet? Let me come do it?

102
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:03,926
Shawn, what do you need?

103
00:05:03,927 --> 00:05:05,798
Have you ever heard
of Deanna Sirtis?

104
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:08,771
She's a tennis player. Local.
Ranked in the low 100s.

105
00:05:08,772 --> 00:05:11,569
<i>She's a missing tennis player.
Ranked 147th.</i>

106
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,768
And she's our new case.

107
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:14,572
I can't, Shawn.
Reingold just retired.

108
00:05:14,573 --> 00:05:16,580
Ah, yes. Reingold.

109
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:18,739
What the hell
does that mean?

110
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,681
It means they're reassigning
his clients, Shawn.

111
00:05:20,682 --> 00:05:22,719
He has this one doctor
with a huge practice.

112
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,776
Dr. Magnotti.

113
00:05:23,777 --> 00:05:26,482
He prescribes in bulk, Shawn.
I'm talking Costco bulk.

114
00:05:26,483 --> 00:05:28,491
<i>I could make my monthly quota
in like a day.</i>

115
00:05:28,492 --> 00:05:30,823
But to get him, I gotta
schmooze my supervisor.

116
00:05:30,824 --> 00:05:32,192
So you're on our own
this time.

117
00:05:32,193 --> 00:05:34,390
Gus! Guess what, Gus?
Hold on.

118
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:38,299
We just elected you to be the first
one to hold the "sharing stick"...

119
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,428
What? ...in the
"sensitivity circle" tonight.

120
00:05:40,429 --> 00:05:41,971
All right, this is great.
Okay.

121
00:05:41,972 --> 00:05:43,506
All right. Oh, gosh!

122
00:05:43,507 --> 00:05:46,475
That's funny. It sounded like
someone just said "sharing stick".

123
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:47,602
Dude, get out of there!

124
00:05:47,603 --> 00:05:49,737
I have no choice. I hate
the stupid "sharing stick".

125
00:05:49,738 --> 00:05:51,372
But I couldn't get out of
this even if I wanted to.

126
00:05:51,373 --> 00:05:53,680
I've taken care of
that already. Burton!

127
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:55,349
Why haven't you
painted yourself green?

128
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,477
Excuse me?

129
00:05:56,478 --> 00:05:59,250
We're all painting ourselves
green. It's an envy-retention thing.

130
00:05:59,251 --> 00:06:01,154
Oh, it doesn't matter now.

131
00:06:01,155 --> 00:06:03,716
I just heard about your
grandmother. My grandmother?

132
00:06:03,717 --> 00:06:06,092
Slipped in the tub?
Broken hip.

133
00:06:06,093 --> 00:06:09,666
Oh! Go square her away and
get back as soon as you can.

134
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:23,870
Well, at least we won't forget
what she looks like.

135
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:26,781
My daughter definitely
liked having her photo taken.

136
00:06:26,782 --> 00:06:29,615
I think it's what she
liked most about winning.

137
00:06:29,616 --> 00:06:31,746
Photography was
her hobby, too.

138
00:06:31,747 --> 00:06:34,189
But we don't have
a lot of time for hobbies.

139
00:06:37,095 --> 00:06:38,925
You keep a security camera
in her room?

140
00:06:38,926 --> 00:06:40,657
That guy, Felix Alvarez,

141
00:06:40,658 --> 00:06:42,665
the one the cops
are looking for now.

142
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:45,258
After he broke in,
we beefed up security.

143
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:46,997
I remember reading
about that break-in here.

144
00:06:46,998 --> 00:06:48,629
It must have been
traumatic for her.

145
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:52,437
Yeah. It felt like she never got
back to her former self as a player.

146
00:06:52,438 --> 00:06:56,139
Mr. Sirtis,
the spirits can be bashful.

147
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,237
Yeah.

148
00:06:57,238 --> 00:07:00,910
Sometimes grumpy,
sleepy, dopey, sneezy...

149
00:07:00,911 --> 00:07:02,009
Shawn. Shawn!

150
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,883
What I'm saying is,

151
00:07:03,884 --> 00:07:05,979
they won't talk to me
unless no one is in the room

152
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,820
except myself
and my compatriot.

153
00:07:07,821 --> 00:07:08,916
That's me.

154
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:11,224
That includes
security cameras.

155
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,563
I'll get it turned off.

156
00:07:13,564 --> 00:07:14,995
Thank you, sir.

157
00:07:14,996 --> 00:07:16,432
Thank you.

158
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,435
Cameras in her room?
Can you say control freak?

159
00:07:20,436 --> 00:07:22,769
Can you say
typical sports dad?

160
00:07:31,516 --> 00:07:32,573
What?

161
00:07:32,574 --> 00:07:35,346
These diamonds pretty
much nail the four C's.

162
00:07:35,347 --> 00:07:37,854
I bet they're from daddy.
Yeah?

163
00:07:42,928 --> 00:07:44,691
Except for this one.

164
00:07:46,898 --> 00:07:47,990
Look.

165
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:51,864
This is way too cheap.

166
00:07:51,865 --> 00:07:55,270
See how the gold chips off
when you slide it around?

167
00:07:56,274 --> 00:07:59,368
This is from somebody else.
Somebody who's not loaded.

168
00:07:59,678 --> 00:08:02,339
This is an eternity ring. You're
supposed to wear this all the time.

169
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,348
And it's usually given to you
by someone, you know, intimate.

170
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:07,077
Why do you know that?

171
00:08:07,078 --> 00:08:08,982
I gave one to Jessica Chan.

172
00:08:08,983 --> 00:08:11,783
Ah, yes, Jessica Chan.

173
00:08:11,784 --> 00:08:13,824
And how long was eternity
for the two of you?

174
00:08:13,825 --> 00:08:15,791
Three months.
But they were awesome months.

175
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:17,157
Except for the end part.

176
00:08:17,158 --> 00:08:18,752
Right. I've never
seen a girl lie

177
00:08:18,753 --> 00:08:20,524
about entering the Witness
Protection Program.

178
00:08:20,525 --> 00:08:22,463
She wasn't lying, Shawn!
Gus, I saw her at Starbucks!

179
00:08:22,464 --> 00:08:23,557
You can't be sure of that.

180
00:08:23,558 --> 00:08:26,967
She was wearing a nametag.
She had a plaque on the wall.

181
00:08:26,968 --> 00:08:30,439
"Employee of the Month." Her hobbies
were hiding and lying about hiding.

182
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:32,675
Fine. Whatever. Drop it.

183
00:08:32,676 --> 00:08:35,803
My point is, why isn't Deanna
wearing hers all the time?

184
00:08:35,804 --> 00:08:38,849
She clearly has someone
daddy doesn't approve of.

185
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,977
We find the mystery lover,
we find her.

186
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:47,586
Dude, why don't I ever
get to say stuff like that?

187
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:51,725
All right. Get her down to
the station and take her statement.

188
00:08:51,726 --> 00:08:53,593
Nail down the last time
she saw Deanna.

189
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:55,393
I'm on my way in now.

190
00:08:55,394 --> 00:08:59,698
I am sensing you're
drinking a nonfat vanilla,

191
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:04,070
half caf with lots of whipped cream
but without your usual pink straw.

192
00:09:04,071 --> 00:09:05,870
What, are you two
stalking me now?

193
00:09:05,871 --> 00:09:07,843
Or did you come to tell me
where the missing girl is?

194
00:09:07,844 --> 00:09:08,971
No.

195
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:12,740
But I did divine that Deanna
has a secret boyfriend,

196
00:09:12,741 --> 00:09:14,478
which sounds
like a lead to me.

197
00:09:14,479 --> 00:09:16,577
Yeah, we're looking into
all her relationships.

198
00:09:16,578 --> 00:09:18,713
But, you see, it's my job
to investigate people

199
00:09:18,714 --> 00:09:22,226
with things like, you know,
motive, means and opportunity.

200
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,122
Stop following me.

201
00:09:24,496 --> 00:09:26,156
What did I say?

202
00:09:26,157 --> 00:09:30,167
Look, man, I've been meaning to have the
same conversation with you about leading me.

203
00:09:30,402 --> 00:09:31,732
To be honest,
I'm sick of it.

204
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:33,566
We either walk side
by side, or not at all.

205
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:41,906
Shawn, six months ago
I called you up

206
00:09:41,907 --> 00:09:44,004
to ask you whether or not
you wanted any of this junk.

207
00:09:44,005 --> 00:09:45,742
How come you only call me
to come pick up stuff?

208
00:09:45,743 --> 00:09:48,046
You didn't listen, now I'm
donating all of it to Goodwill.

209
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:49,312
I'm on my way there
right now,

210
00:09:49,313 --> 00:09:51,718
so you got about 30 seconds,
last looks.

211
00:09:51,719 --> 00:09:54,485
No, no, no.

212
00:09:54,486 --> 00:09:57,391
You cannot throw out
my Whitesnake T-shirt.

213
00:09:57,392 --> 00:09:59,486
You can't get this
in stores anymore.

214
00:09:59,487 --> 00:10:00,928
That is...

215
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:02,656
<i>This is my
Airwolf windbreaker.</i>

216
00:10:02,657 --> 00:10:04,701
I've been looking for this
for like five years now.

217
00:10:04,702 --> 00:10:06,793
Why did you take this? I
never even saw you wear it.

218
00:10:06,794 --> 00:10:09,272
Of course I didn't wear it.
I took it, so you wouldn't.

219
00:10:09,741 --> 00:10:11,264
Don't put it on.

220
00:10:11,265 --> 00:10:14,938
<i>Gus, nobody had an Airwolfjacket
except Jan-Michael Vincent.</i>

221
00:10:16,715 --> 00:10:19,182
This looks like a custom
Sak-Hart graphite rod and reel.

222
00:10:19,183 --> 00:10:21,013
That's right. Good eye.

223
00:10:21,014 --> 00:10:22,450
You can't throw
something like this away.

224
00:10:22,451 --> 00:10:23,748
It's 15 years old.

225
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:24,981
Fifteen? Looks brand-new.

226
00:10:24,982 --> 00:10:27,421
Oh, that's because
it's never been used.

227
00:10:27,422 --> 00:10:29,186
Bought it for him.

228
00:10:29,187 --> 00:10:31,888
Man, I have been itching to get out
on the blue and hook some snapper,

229
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:33,953
but you know what a chore
it is to get the boat and...

230
00:10:33,954 --> 00:10:35,999
You're welcome to come
with me tomorrow morning.

231
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,330
Boat leaves
at 5:00 a.m. Sharp.

232
00:10:38,331 --> 00:10:41,735
Princess here,
never could get him up.

233
00:10:41,736 --> 00:10:45,866
Look, the American Medical Association
clearly states the proper amount of sleep...

234
00:10:45,867 --> 00:10:48,707
Well, if you're sure you
don't mind a little company?

235
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,713
If you're sure
you can be there at 5:00 a.m.

236
00:10:50,714 --> 00:10:52,976
<i>I'll be on the docks
at 4:15 a.m.</i>

237
00:10:52,977 --> 00:10:54,279
Spencer.

238
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,651
What just
happened here?

239
00:10:59,652 --> 00:11:01,589
I think your dad just
made his first play-date.

240
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,690
It's not funny.
It is.

241
00:11:04,691 --> 00:11:09,757
He gave away my custom something
something pole. I loved that thing.

242
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:11,598
You gonna get it back?

243
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:15,298
No. We are going to the Vista
Rico Health and Racquet club.

244
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,237
Now's not the time
for a steam, Shawn.

245
00:11:17,238 --> 00:11:19,173
Gus, Deanna was seen
practicing there

246
00:11:19,174 --> 00:11:20,437
the morning she disappeared.

247
00:11:20,438 --> 00:11:23,275
If she's some sort of tennis star,
she probably goes there a lot.

248
00:11:23,276 --> 00:11:26,283
Maybe someone saw her
with her mystery lover!

249
00:11:26,751 --> 00:11:27,808
How did that sound?

250
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:29,945
It feels like you're
pushing. You're pressing.

251
00:11:35,093 --> 00:11:36,559
Deanna's coach
is in Tokyo,

252
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,494
but the manager said this girl was here
practicing the last time Deanna was.

253
00:11:39,495 --> 00:11:40,825
Sweet.

254
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:43,366
Excuse me, can we talk
to you for a second?

255
00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:46,062
I only have 11 minutes
left to practice.

256
00:11:46,063 --> 00:11:49,128
Yeah, but isn't it better if someone's
over there to return your serve?

257
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:52,643
You play? No, but this is
Vernest Lambert Watkins.

258
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:55,807
He was a junior champion
of some junior league.

259
00:11:55,808 --> 00:11:58,939
What did you guys call yourselves?
The Little Green Fuzzymen?

260
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,712
The Yellow Hornets. But
that was like 10 years ago.

261
00:12:01,713 --> 00:12:04,413
He'll give you a workout.
We're just gonna have a chat.

262
00:12:04,414 --> 00:12:05,854
Racket's over here?

263
00:12:07,325 --> 00:12:11,693
Now, I can sense that you were
here the day Deanna disappeared.

264
00:12:11,694 --> 00:12:15,494
Duh. Everybody knows we hit
together. What are you, a genius?

265
00:12:17,802 --> 00:12:18,995
Actually,
I'm a psychic.

266
00:12:18,996 --> 00:12:21,538
And I don't think
I like your tone.

267
00:12:30,181 --> 00:12:33,513
Let me rephrase that, and don't
read anything into my tone,

268
00:12:33,514 --> 00:12:36,816
why do you think she didn't show
up to that tournament in Tokyo?

269
00:12:39,124 --> 00:12:40,249
Out.

270
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,951
Out? Out my ass!

271
00:12:41,952 --> 00:12:44,051
You can't be serious. That
ball was clearly on the line!

272
00:12:44,052 --> 00:12:45,721
Long. Long by
a hair, buddy.

273
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:49,524
Any ideas?

274
00:12:49,525 --> 00:12:51,591
You know what
her weakness was?

275
00:12:51,592 --> 00:12:52,795
Kittens?

276
00:12:52,796 --> 00:12:55,601
Focus. All she thought
about was boys.

277
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:02,773
Cowboy up there, buddy.

278
00:13:02,774 --> 00:13:04,212
Shut up.

279
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:06,279
Any boys in particular?

280
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,749
She was not particular
at all.

281
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,082
But I heard she started hanging
out with that Doug Lenmar.

282
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:13,180
Doug Lenmar? He's one of the
top-ranked players on the men's tour.

283
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:14,952
He stinks. No net game.

284
00:13:14,953 --> 00:13:18,017
Her father totally freaked when he
found out and told her to end it.

285
00:13:18,018 --> 00:13:20,962
Then she tried to be all rebellious
and stormed off the court.

286
00:13:20,963 --> 00:13:23,023
How grody of her.

287
00:13:24,736 --> 00:13:26,897
Grody?
Grody to the max?

288
00:13:27,305 --> 00:13:29,034
Grody with a spoon.

289
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:33,073
Come on, work with me. I don't know
what the kids are saying these days.

290
00:13:33,745 --> 00:13:36,270
I don't remember anything
else. That's all I heard.

291
00:13:36,981 --> 00:13:38,072
Well, you hear a lot.

292
00:13:38,073 --> 00:13:40,810
Coaches are more gossipy
than housewives.

293
00:13:40,811 --> 00:13:42,852
Just watch. In five years,

294
00:13:42,853 --> 00:13:45,980
she'll be knocked up and living
in government assisted housing.

295
00:13:45,981 --> 00:13:49,049
It's good to see
the game hasn't hardened you.

296
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,487
Out!

297
00:13:50,488 --> 00:13:53,758
Okay, so we know she had a
secret boyfriend, Doug Lenmar.

298
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:56,322
But if he was in Tokyo,
why would she go to see him?

299
00:13:56,323 --> 00:13:58,368
Let's find out
if he really is in Tokyo.

300
00:13:58,369 --> 00:14:01,165
If so, plan B.
She was boy-crazy.

301
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,001
There's got to be more
than one dude in the mix.

302
00:14:03,002 --> 00:14:05,507
Maybe she's not missing.
Maybe she's hiding.

303
00:14:05,508 --> 00:14:08,773
To keep her dad off her case.
But where would she hide?

304
00:14:08,774 --> 00:14:10,144
Ooh.
What?

305
00:14:11,883 --> 00:14:14,977
I have the urge to suddenly
get my bunions buffed.

306
00:14:19,357 --> 00:14:21,153
Shawn, this is
completely unnecessary.

307
00:14:21,154 --> 00:14:23,250
Deanna was here.
We have to retrace her steps.

308
00:14:23,251 --> 00:14:24,692
In a paraffin wax dip?

309
00:14:24,693 --> 00:14:26,229
You know how flaky
my knuckles get.

310
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,992
Two birds, one stone.
I've never felt so productive.

311
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,966
And exactly how much information
do you plan on getting

312
00:14:30,967 --> 00:14:33,002
from a manicurist
that can't speak English?

313
00:14:33,003 --> 00:14:34,537
None so far.

314
00:14:34,538 --> 00:14:35,834
Hold on.

315
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:40,842
Dude.

316
00:14:47,385 --> 00:14:48,647
Hurry up!

317
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:51,985
She was here yesterday.

318
00:14:51,986 --> 00:14:53,215
Check that out.

319
00:14:53,216 --> 00:14:55,350
Gus, you're gonna
smudge my gloss.

320
00:14:57,362 --> 00:14:58,953
She ordered
nail protein solution.

321
00:14:58,954 --> 00:15:00,394
So she has weak,
peeling nails.

322
00:15:00,395 --> 00:15:02,898
No, genius. The billing
address is her father's place,

323
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:05,993
but the delivery address
is someplace else.

324
00:15:07,105 --> 00:15:08,969
Nice focus, Gus.
Thank you.

325
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:11,668
Maybe you're ready to take
on that little girl again.

326
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:15,871
Gus, I feel good
about this.

327
00:15:15,872 --> 00:15:19,347
She's gonna be here.
Safe and sound.

328
00:15:24,455 --> 00:15:25,683
Or not.

329
00:15:31,896 --> 00:15:35,263
All right, I want to talk to
her the minute she wakes up.

330
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:37,093
If she wakes up.

331
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:39,760
What happened here?

332
00:15:39,761 --> 00:15:42,465
This isn't a missing
person case any more.

333
00:15:42,466 --> 00:15:43,837
It's attempted murder.

334
00:15:45,643 --> 00:15:48,510
Man, even she gets
to say stuff like that.

335
00:16:06,297 --> 00:16:07,854
That's more crappy jewelry.

336
00:16:07,855 --> 00:16:10,559
That means the working-class
boyfriend has been here.

337
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,261
Hey, aren't you
Henry Spencer's kid?

338
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,564
That I am.

339
00:16:13,565 --> 00:16:16,231
I took a six-week course
he taught at the academy.

340
00:16:16,232 --> 00:16:18,172
Lucky you. How was he?

341
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:23,146
Yeah, that just
about sums it up.

342
00:16:23,147 --> 00:16:24,976
Do you mind if we
poke around a little?

343
00:16:24,977 --> 00:16:26,107
No.

344
00:16:26,918 --> 00:16:29,351
We do. We mind
quite a bit actually.

345
00:16:29,352 --> 00:16:31,751
You know what,
scratch that.

346
00:16:31,752 --> 00:16:34,256
I'm gonna let you guys stick around
to see what real detectives do.

347
00:16:34,257 --> 00:16:37,055
Sweet! Just let us know
when they arrive.

348
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:40,128
Deanna shared this place with
another player on the tour,

349
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:41,960
so her name wasn't
on the lease.

350
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:44,557
But Lassiter found
one of her close friends.

351
00:16:44,558 --> 00:16:47,229
Apparently, they met frequently
at that Indian restaurant.

352
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,999
We canvassed the area
with her photo

353
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,835
and the owner of this building
recognized her.

354
00:16:50,836 --> 00:16:53,570
<i>So we opened the
door and voilà. Voilà.</i>

355
00:16:53,571 --> 00:16:55,977
O'Hara, come
take a look at this.

356
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,781
Check this out.

357
00:17:07,325 --> 00:17:09,690
I think these were all
taken inside this apartment.

358
00:17:09,691 --> 00:17:11,422
I think you're right.

359
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,699
Wait a second.
What?

360
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:26,635
I see something!

361
00:17:27,812 --> 00:17:30,042
I see a trophy.

362
00:17:31,115 --> 00:17:32,946
But I'm out of place.

363
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:35,846
I've been kidnapped.

364
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:39,117
There is a trophy
missing from here.

365
00:17:39,118 --> 00:17:41,180
And we know she suffered
a blunt force trauma.

366
00:17:41,181 --> 00:17:43,522
Possibly the weapon.
Good work, O'Hara.

367
00:17:43,523 --> 00:17:45,288
O'Hara? That was all us!

368
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:48,230
I think your tutorial in police
work is done now. Goodbye.

369
00:17:58,409 --> 00:18:01,037
It's cool. I've got
everything we need.

370
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:08,282
Deanna is listed as critical
but stable for now.

371
00:18:08,283 --> 00:18:10,252
<i>She's touch and go
for the next 48 hours.</i>

372
00:18:10,253 --> 00:18:12,618
<i>...50 pounds and is
considered to be armed and dangerous.</i>

373
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:14,953
<i>Anyone with information as
to the whereabouts of this man...</i>

374
00:18:14,954 --> 00:18:16,151
Gosh!

375
00:18:16,152 --> 00:18:18,091
Finding Deanna lit a fire
under the department.

376
00:18:18,092 --> 00:18:20,789
<i>Lassiter's been having
these advisory alerts run 24/7.</i>

377
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,331
So let me
get this straight.

378
00:18:22,332 --> 00:18:25,459
Their theory is that Felix
followed her to her hideaway,

379
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,162
and showed his love
by trying to kill her?

380
00:18:27,163 --> 00:18:28,704
Not a terrible theory.

381
00:18:28,705 --> 00:18:30,841
Let's review, shall we?

382
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:32,841
No forced entry.

383
00:18:32,842 --> 00:18:35,343
That means she either let the
attacker in or he had a key.

384
00:18:35,344 --> 00:18:37,312
Sounds like someone
she was intimate with.

385
00:18:37,313 --> 00:18:40,043
Now, the toilet seat
in her apartment was up.

386
00:18:40,044 --> 00:18:41,948
So we know there was
a guy there recently.

387
00:18:41,949 --> 00:18:44,283
I doubt the killer stopped
to use the little boy's room,

388
00:18:44,284 --> 00:18:47,654
so let's assume the phantom
boyfriend stopped by for a matinee.

389
00:18:49,093 --> 00:18:51,560
And there were two wine
glasses missing from her set.

390
00:18:51,561 --> 00:18:54,289
So she probably shared a drink
with him, and he grabbed the glasses

391
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:58,768
which had his fingerprints on
them as he beat a discreet retreat.

392
00:19:01,606 --> 00:19:03,369
None of that points to Felix.

393
00:19:04,442 --> 00:19:05,738
I gotta get back to work.

394
00:19:05,739 --> 00:19:07,242
Now?
You're gonna leave now?

395
00:19:07,243 --> 00:19:08,709
When we're up to our necks
in intrigue?

396
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,111
The case is almost closed. We
have the girl, she's still alive.

397
00:19:11,112 --> 00:19:12,648
The cops beat us.
Let them have this one.

398
00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:13,842
How can you be so negative?

399
00:19:13,843 --> 00:19:15,748
Easy. I need face time
with my boss.

400
00:19:15,749 --> 00:19:17,684
I already missed the
pamper pole trust exercise.

401
00:19:17,685 --> 00:19:20,052
I'm uncomfortable with you even
saying the words "pamper pole".

402
00:19:20,053 --> 00:19:22,455
Look, every minute the cops
spend looking for Felix,

403
00:19:22,456 --> 00:19:24,221
the real attacker
breathes easier.

404
00:19:24,222 --> 00:19:27,127
Now we have got to convince them
to start looking for other suspects.

405
00:19:27,128 --> 00:19:28,323
No.

406
00:19:28,324 --> 00:19:30,764
Unless you can give us something
more substantial, Mr. Spencer,

407
00:19:30,765 --> 00:19:33,303
we're gonna continue the
manhunt for Felix Alvarez.

408
00:19:33,638 --> 00:19:35,229
Manhunt?
Mmm-hmm.

409
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,671
<i>Hey, I can project Tommy
Lee Jones from The Fugitive</i>

410
00:19:37,672 --> 00:19:38,765
if you'd like.

411
00:19:38,766 --> 00:19:42,801
I want a hard-target search for
every outhouse, henhouse, cathouse,

412
00:19:42,802 --> 00:19:44,973
<i>waffle house,
House M.D.</i>

413
00:19:45,783 --> 00:19:47,477
<i>House of the
Long Shadows? What?</i>

414
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:48,916
Crime scene photos,
Detective.

415
00:19:48,917 --> 00:19:50,646
It's about time.
Were you on a break?

416
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,687
Hey!

417
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,048
Dad?

418
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:55,916
Now what?

419
00:19:55,917 --> 00:19:58,460
I just stopped by to drop off
this hat for Mr. Lassiter,

420
00:19:58,461 --> 00:20:01,554
so he can look the part next time
we go out and catch us some snapper.

421
00:20:01,555 --> 00:20:02,655
Thanks.

422
00:20:02,656 --> 00:20:04,997
The next time
you go out and...

423
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:06,997
Isn't that my hat?

424
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:08,298
What are you doing here?

425
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:10,236
Oh, you know, just interrupting
an official briefing,

426
00:20:10,237 --> 00:20:11,797
and being in general,
pain in my ass.

427
00:20:11,798 --> 00:20:14,140
Oh, well, try living
with him for 17 years.

428
00:20:15,577 --> 00:20:18,410
Excuse me. I have
a killer to catch.

429
00:20:20,418 --> 00:20:22,181
Good luck with that.

430
00:20:25,377 --> 00:20:27,185
And time!

431
00:20:27,758 --> 00:20:28,952
Nicely done.

432
00:20:31,696 --> 00:20:32,685
Excuse me a second.

433
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:34,154
What're you doing here?

434
00:20:34,155 --> 00:20:35,664
Dude, you turned off
your cell phone.

435
00:20:35,665 --> 00:20:37,666
Some might take that as a
hint. As in, "Leave me alone."

436
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:40,134
Burton, you're not
having visitors, are you?

437
00:20:40,135 --> 00:20:41,670
You know my policy
on visitors.

438
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:43,672
He's not a visitor...
Jerry Hathaway.

439
00:20:43,673 --> 00:20:46,107
I too work at Central Coast.
In the lab.

440
00:20:47,979 --> 00:20:50,742
Yes, I worked on the
mono-thio-Huxtable drug.

441
00:20:50,743 --> 00:20:52,748
It's for pancake-
reactic function.

442
00:20:52,749 --> 00:20:53,874
Pancreatic.

443
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,748
Actually, no, Burton.
It was pancake. Really?

444
00:20:56,749 --> 00:20:59,288
Yes, there are properties in the
batter that help to stabilize

445
00:20:59,289 --> 00:21:00,914
the ions
we were working with.

446
00:21:00,915 --> 00:21:02,288
I never heard
of that project.

447
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:03,986
It was a great drug.

448
00:21:03,987 --> 00:21:06,893
But it caused headaches,
stomach aches, tooth aches,

449
00:21:06,894 --> 00:21:11,127
weight gain, weight loss, balding,
sever oily bowel discharge,

450
00:21:11,128 --> 00:21:14,602
and in very rare cases
it made you pee fire.

451
00:21:14,603 --> 00:21:15,865
Wow!

452
00:21:15,866 --> 00:21:18,601
Yeah. So the higher-ups
shelved the project,

453
00:21:18,602 --> 00:21:20,268
much to my chagrin.

454
00:21:20,478 --> 00:21:22,069
I thought I knew
all the lab guys.

455
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,806
I'm surprised
we've never met before.

456
00:21:23,807 --> 00:21:26,713
I don't make much of an
impact on other human beings.

457
00:21:26,714 --> 00:21:28,944
It's terrible
for my self esteem.

458
00:21:28,945 --> 00:21:31,510
In fact, I've been here
all weekend,

459
00:21:31,511 --> 00:21:33,557
and this is the first
conversation I've had.

460
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:37,686
And, Tom, you should know
that nobody made me a nametag.

461
00:21:38,462 --> 00:21:41,363
You know what we say
about that here. Hello.

462
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,261
Hi, Tom.

463
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:48,337
No, I mean the motto
of the weekend. H-E-L-L-O.

464
00:21:48,338 --> 00:21:51,169
Lop off the last letter and you've
got what this weekend really is.

465
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:54,575
Stands for Health, Esteem,
Life, Love and Openness.

466
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:56,770
Well, that's
pretty keen, Tom.

467
00:21:56,771 --> 00:22:00,009
You know, in the spirit of openness,
I've always looked up to Gus.

468
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,778
He's everything
I wish I was.

469
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:04,251
Do you think maybe we could work
on the next exercise together?

470
00:22:04,252 --> 00:22:05,811
No, we can't do that.
Burton!

471
00:22:05,812 --> 00:22:07,982
I believe your friend
is reaching out right now.

472
00:22:07,983 --> 00:22:10,652
I think you two would be perfect
candidates for the Minefield.

473
00:22:10,653 --> 00:22:12,752
Burton, you have to
keep your eyes closed

474
00:22:12,753 --> 00:22:14,820
while your friend leads you
through a series of obstacles.

475
00:22:14,821 --> 00:22:17,424
Oh, Tom! That sounds
really bitching!

476
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,164
Can I talk to him alone
for a second? Sure!

477
00:22:21,165 --> 00:22:23,229
Oh, great, thanks!
Oh, gosh.

478
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,603
Dude, I've got bad news.
What?

479
00:22:24,604 --> 00:22:27,074
Deanna's doctors say she
showing signs of improvement.

480
00:22:27,075 --> 00:22:29,577
Shawn, in the health care
community, we call that good news.

481
00:22:29,578 --> 00:22:31,307
Given what we already know?

482
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,939
Did she know her attacker?
Yes.

483
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,849
Does that mean when she
wakes up she can ID him?

484
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:38,149
She ID's him and the case is
closed. Where's the downside?

485
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,381
Because if you're
the bad guy

486
00:22:39,382 --> 00:22:41,924
and you know that your victim could
wake up and point the finger at you...

487
00:22:41,925 --> 00:22:44,518
He'll find
her and finish her off!

488
00:22:45,296 --> 00:22:46,922
You're just not landing it.

489
00:22:46,923 --> 00:22:48,087
The point is,

490
00:22:48,088 --> 00:22:50,132
Deanna's life is in
danger now more then ever,

491
00:22:50,133 --> 00:22:51,667
and she needs us.

492
00:22:51,668 --> 00:22:53,829
Burton, is there a problem?

493
00:22:54,405 --> 00:22:56,235
Yes, Tom,
I'm afraid there is.

494
00:22:56,236 --> 00:22:59,742
Burton's grandmother just
called. She's broken her hip.

495
00:22:59,743 --> 00:23:01,810
I thought you dealt
with that issue already.

496
00:23:01,811 --> 00:23:03,675
The other side.
Tore the M.C.L.

497
00:23:03,676 --> 00:23:05,874
She did it while trying to
do her line dancing classes.

498
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:09,407
Why was an 87-year-old woman with a
broken hip attending a line dancing class?

499
00:23:09,408 --> 00:23:11,785
Attending?
She was teaching it.

500
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:15,219
You leave my grandson
alone. He's a good boy.

501
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,624
Oh, yeah. Then why did he
run when he saw us coming?

502
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:19,753
Because you guys got my face
plastered all over the TV

503
00:23:19,754 --> 00:23:21,763
for something I didn't
do, man. I'm innocent!

504
00:23:21,764 --> 00:23:23,355
I don't even think
about her anymore.

505
00:23:23,356 --> 00:23:25,230
Yeah, see, that's what
all the crazy stalkers say.

506
00:23:25,231 --> 00:23:26,429
Stop!

507
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:29,838
Just... stop.

508
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:30,964
Hey, what the hell?

509
00:23:30,965 --> 00:23:32,531
What are you doing?
Get your hand off him.

510
00:23:32,532 --> 00:23:34,076
He's reading his guilt.
Give him a second.

511
00:23:34,077 --> 00:23:37,443
Hamana, Hamana,
Hamana, Hamana,

512
00:23:37,444 --> 00:23:42,316
Ricky, Enrique, Heraldo,
Menudo, Richie!

513
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,052
This man is
true to his word.

514
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,129
He's pure of heart.

515
00:23:55,566 --> 00:23:59,968
He made many mistakes
in his past.

516
00:23:59,969 --> 00:24:03,437
Dirty, filthy mistake.

517
00:24:03,438 --> 00:24:06,476
See, I'm not telling you anything
you don't already know here.

518
00:24:07,945 --> 00:24:09,412
But he didn't attack Deanna.

519
00:24:11,248 --> 00:24:12,442
Really?

520
00:24:13,584 --> 00:24:15,141
If he's so pure of heart,

521
00:24:15,142 --> 00:24:19,053
why did we find the trophy that she was
nearly bludgeoned to death with in his car?

522
00:24:41,946 --> 00:24:44,243
The raven crows
only at midnight,

523
00:24:44,244 --> 00:24:46,681
dusk is for
the rooster's cackle.

524
00:24:47,218 --> 00:24:48,309
What?

525
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,977
Jules, that's your cue
to cackle.

526
00:24:49,978 --> 00:24:51,816
Shawn, I don't have a
cackle in my repertoire.

527
00:24:51,817 --> 00:24:53,185
What, you called for
this secret meeting.

528
00:24:53,186 --> 00:24:55,121
We should use code-speak
in case people are listening?

529
00:24:55,122 --> 00:24:58,524
It's not secret.
Just away from prying eyes.

530
00:24:58,525 --> 00:24:59,926
So what do you propose?

531
00:24:59,927 --> 00:25:02,089
Should we rent one of those pedal
boats that looks like a swan?

532
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:05,533
We could, or you
could just take these.

533
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,561
What is this?

534
00:25:07,562 --> 00:25:09,502
Copies of the files
on Felix Alvarez.

535
00:25:09,503 --> 00:25:10,971
Why are you giving
this to me?

536
00:25:10,972 --> 00:25:12,769
I've talked to the kid,
his grandmother

537
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,366
and the court-ordered
psychiatrist he had to see

538
00:25:14,367 --> 00:25:15,775
after breaking
into Deanna's house.

539
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:19,042
They all say the months of counseling
paid off. He was rehabilitated.

540
00:25:19,043 --> 00:25:22,210
And he had a medical condition
that required dialysis.

541
00:25:22,453 --> 00:25:24,579
My great-aunt
needed dialysis,

542
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:28,421
and she was always knockdown-dragout,
winter-bear tired afterward.

543
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,418
And his last appointment
probably left him

544
00:25:31,419 --> 00:25:35,055
way too winter-bear tired
to stalk and attack Deanna.

545
00:25:35,056 --> 00:25:36,120
Exactly.

546
00:25:36,121 --> 00:25:38,064
And just what did the
police do when you fed them

547
00:25:38,065 --> 00:25:39,624
this peculiar piece
of info-gristle?

548
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:40,726
They spit it out.

549
00:25:40,727 --> 00:25:42,704
In fact, they're so
certain that he's the guy,

550
00:25:42,705 --> 00:25:45,833
<i>they've taken the 2
4- hour guard off of Deanna's hospital room.</i>

551
00:25:53,584 --> 00:25:56,313
Jules, that's no good. You gotta
get security back on that door.

552
00:25:56,314 --> 00:25:57,717
The killer will come
back. He'll try again.

553
00:25:57,718 --> 00:26:00,312
At the very least, her dad
is always by her bedside.

554
00:26:00,313 --> 00:26:01,652
Have you seen that dude?

555
00:26:01,653 --> 00:26:04,284
She needs more security than
a 60-year-old in a track suit.

556
00:26:04,285 --> 00:26:07,193
Look, without protection, you might as
well just send the killer an invitation,

557
00:26:07,194 --> 00:26:09,697
saying, "Hey, come on
back, finish the job."

558
00:26:09,698 --> 00:26:11,529
I wonder if they make
invitations for that.

559
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,899
I don't see why not. You can
send an evite for anything.

560
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,164
This is true.

561
00:26:15,165 --> 00:26:18,002
Lassiter thinks it's an
inefficient use of manpower.

562
00:26:18,003 --> 00:26:20,304
I'll see what I can divine.
What's this?

563
00:26:20,305 --> 00:26:22,844
It's rest of the paperwork
on Felix's first break-in.

564
00:26:22,845 --> 00:26:25,848
I figure you need all this
information to do your psychic stuff.

565
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,185
I can feel these two crimes were
not committed by the same person.

566
00:26:39,186 --> 00:26:42,163
But in order for your
brothers in blue to be wrong,

567
00:26:42,164 --> 00:26:44,166
we're saying
Felix was framed.

568
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:46,794
We're saying it was somebody who knew
he would be targeted by the police.

569
00:26:46,795 --> 00:26:49,430
You're saying it. I'm
stealthily lending an ear,

570
00:26:49,431 --> 00:26:52,202
I'm saying it was an
excellent, slam-dunk frame-up.

571
00:26:52,203 --> 00:26:54,243
This somebody was a
pretty bad guy. Yes.

572
00:26:54,244 --> 00:26:55,572
Ugly on the inside.

573
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:59,411
Thought of every detail. A
virtual hunchback mastermind...

574
00:26:59,412 --> 00:27:01,814
Shawn! Just let me know
what you find.

575
00:27:01,815 --> 00:27:04,217
And remember, psychic intuition's
not gonna help this guy.

576
00:27:04,218 --> 00:27:05,481
Evidence will.

577
00:27:05,482 --> 00:27:07,352
Oh, one more thing.

578
00:27:07,353 --> 00:27:08,720
Roosters don't cackle.

579
00:27:08,721 --> 00:27:10,452
I beg your pardon.

580
00:27:10,453 --> 00:27:12,428
They cock-a-doodle-doo.

581
00:27:26,243 --> 00:27:27,709
You've got
to be kidding me.

582
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,438
Shawn, what are
you doing here?

583
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,672
I don't know.

584
00:27:30,673 --> 00:27:33,477
<i>I guess I took a wrong turn and
ended it up in The Twilight Zone.</i>

585
00:27:33,478 --> 00:27:34,574
What the hell's
going on here?

586
00:27:34,575 --> 00:27:36,642
What? We caught us
some lunch this morning.

587
00:27:36,643 --> 00:27:38,448
Hooked them, cooked
them and ate them.

588
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:39,886
How tribal of you.

589
00:27:39,887 --> 00:27:42,253
Shawn never really was
one for roughing it.

590
00:27:42,254 --> 00:27:46,056
We went camping once, found him
curled up inside his sleeping bag

591
00:27:46,057 --> 00:27:48,029
because a raccoon
was hunting him.

592
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,760
Stalking me. The raccoon
was stalking me, Dad.

593
00:27:52,336 --> 00:27:55,202
And I came to
talk to you. Alone.

594
00:27:55,203 --> 00:27:57,433
All righty.
So, what's wrong?

595
00:27:58,642 --> 00:28:00,610
All right,
here's the thing.

596
00:28:03,547 --> 00:28:06,277
Why is there a picture of
Lassiter on your refrigerator?

597
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,273
That's a picture
of the fish.

598
00:28:08,274 --> 00:28:10,820
I didn't even know
he was in there.

599
00:28:11,188 --> 00:28:13,678
What could you guys possibly
talk about out there?

600
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,054
Shawn, that is the
beauty part. Nothing.

601
00:28:16,055 --> 00:28:18,593
He knows to sit there,
shut up and fish.

602
00:28:18,594 --> 00:28:21,357
What? You think we sit out there,
we yap about you all day long?

603
00:28:21,358 --> 00:28:23,490
I can't really wrap
my brain around any of it.

604
00:28:23,491 --> 00:28:26,035
All right,
so what's so important?

605
00:28:27,137 --> 00:28:28,798
I'm working on a case.

606
00:28:31,308 --> 00:28:33,400
And I know that they've
arrested the wrong guy.

607
00:28:33,401 --> 00:28:34,670
What makes you so sure?

608
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:35,870
The M.O.

609
00:28:35,871 --> 00:28:39,437
Right? This guy in custody, he
trashes a girl's house, trashes it,

610
00:28:39,438 --> 00:28:43,042
but then, at the apartment when they
find her, it's practically sterile.

611
00:28:43,043 --> 00:28:44,882
I'm talking about
a perfect crime scene.

612
00:28:44,883 --> 00:28:47,718
But I cannot find anything in
these police reports to back me up.

613
00:28:47,719 --> 00:28:50,452
Right there. You see, right
there. That's your first problem.

614
00:28:50,453 --> 00:28:52,517
What?
The police reports.

615
00:28:52,518 --> 00:28:55,496
Shawn, a police report is always
from somebody else's point of view.

616
00:28:55,497 --> 00:28:57,089
I've written
a ton of them myself,

617
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:59,727
and one thing you cannot do
is take them as gospel.

618
00:29:00,938 --> 00:29:03,371
All right? So let's
run this again.

619
00:29:03,372 --> 00:29:05,202
Now you've been to
both crime scenes, right?

620
00:29:05,203 --> 00:29:07,299
Right. Well, the first one
was after the fact,

621
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,867
but I've been
to both places, yeah.

622
00:29:08,868 --> 00:29:10,379
Okay. So...

623
00:29:10,848 --> 00:29:12,440
close your eyes.

624
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:16,107
Dad, I didn't come here to take a
stupid test. Can't we just talk as men?

625
00:29:16,108 --> 00:29:19,815
Shawn, would you trust your
old man for once, just once?

626
00:29:20,591 --> 00:29:21,990
Close your eyes.

627
00:29:25,763 --> 00:29:27,059
Here we go.

628
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,758
All right, now I want you to go
back to the first crime scene.

629
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:31,994
This poor girl's house.
What do you see?

630
00:29:32,236 --> 00:29:33,863
What do I see?

631
00:29:34,805 --> 00:29:36,067
Her bed.

632
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,466
<i>Tennis trophies.</i>

633
00:29:38,467 --> 00:29:40,940
<i>Jewelry box.
Mostly nice jewelry.</i>

634
00:29:40,941 --> 00:29:43,707
<i>A wall of photos
featuring her.</i>

635
00:29:46,717 --> 00:29:48,047
Come on, keep going.

636
00:29:48,048 --> 00:29:49,516
Keep going, Shawn,
what else?

637
00:29:49,517 --> 00:29:50,950
No, there is nothing else.

638
00:29:50,951 --> 00:29:52,282
The guy was there
way before me.

639
00:29:52,283 --> 00:29:53,379
Everything looks
different now.

640
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:56,448
Okay. Okay. Now let's go
to the second crime scene.

641
00:29:56,449 --> 00:29:58,994
To this apartment
where she was found.

642
00:29:58,995 --> 00:30:00,825
Can we stop on the way
and get donuts?

643
00:30:00,826 --> 00:30:02,388
Shawn, focus.

644
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,858
Keep your eyes closed.

645
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,696
What do you see?

646
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:23,212
Wait a minute.

647
00:30:34,865 --> 00:30:38,631
Thank you, Dad. I have a
crime scene to break into.

648
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:52,041
I can't believe you pulled
me out of my retreat.

649
00:30:52,042 --> 00:30:55,279
I can kiss my chances of getting
Dr. Feelgood on my route goodbye.

650
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:02,314
Gus, what time
do you have?

651
00:31:02,315 --> 00:31:03,415
Where's your watch at?

652
00:31:03,416 --> 00:31:05,519
It's a key tanning month.

653
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,189
2:15 p.m.

654
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:10,459
2:15 p.m. Right.

655
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,866
It's around the same time
we were here before.

656
00:31:14,638 --> 00:31:17,072
So, why are
all these clocks wrong?

657
00:31:17,808 --> 00:31:18,967
Dude,

658
00:31:18,968 --> 00:31:21,908
I need you to lay the ground,
pretend like you're Deanna.

659
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:24,776
I am not pretending to be a woman
half beaten to death, Shawn.

660
00:31:24,777 --> 00:31:25,905
You know what?

661
00:31:25,906 --> 00:31:28,314
I am starting to wonder if
you have trust issues with me.

662
00:31:28,315 --> 00:31:29,612
Really?
Yes.

663
00:31:29,613 --> 00:31:31,118
First, you wouldn't do
the Minefield,

664
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:34,281
now you won't lay on the floor and
pretend to be an unconscious woman for me.

665
00:31:34,282 --> 00:31:35,483
What's going on with you?

666
00:31:35,484 --> 00:31:38,357
<i>Two words.
Airwolf windbreaker.</i>

667
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,019
Okay, two more.

668
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,828
<i>Airwolf windbreaker.</i>

669
00:31:44,201 --> 00:31:46,498
Battleship. Dude, that was
like a million years ago.

670
00:31:46,499 --> 00:31:47,558
I'm just saying.

671
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:50,401
I never cheated again. Now
can we please just do this?

672
00:31:50,402 --> 00:31:52,407
What is the point in me
pretending to be Deanna?

673
00:31:52,408 --> 00:31:53,806
Something here's weird,
okay?

674
00:31:53,807 --> 00:31:57,107
When I was with my dad, I realized
the shadows coming off those two lamps

675
00:31:57,108 --> 00:31:59,239
were in the wrong spots.

676
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,715
I think someone tampered
with this crime scene.

677
00:32:01,716 --> 00:32:02,944
Who could do that?

678
00:32:02,945 --> 00:32:05,112
Someone smart.
Someone experienced.

679
00:32:05,113 --> 00:32:07,156
Which is why we need
to recreate the scene

680
00:32:07,157 --> 00:32:09,282
so that it is exactly the way
it was when the cops got here.

681
00:32:09,283 --> 00:32:10,416
All right. Fine.

682
00:32:10,417 --> 00:32:12,154
Fine. Now,
in the landlord's statement,

683
00:32:12,155 --> 00:32:13,661
he said the body was found

684
00:32:13,662 --> 00:32:18,099
here in the supine position.
So, please, if you will...

685
00:32:18,635 --> 00:32:21,798
Sure. Just tell me
what supine means.

686
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:23,763
Gus, supine.

687
00:32:25,309 --> 00:32:26,799
Su...
Mmm-hmm.

688
00:32:28,712 --> 00:32:29,940
...pine.

689
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:32,280
You don't know what
the word means, do you?

690
00:32:32,281 --> 00:32:35,079
Okay, fine. You win.
Mr. Vocabulary wins.

691
00:32:35,652 --> 00:32:38,415
Mr. Vocab is the big winner
tonight, everybody.

692
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:40,319
Thank you.
No, please, please.

693
00:32:40,691 --> 00:32:42,488
It means on your back.

694
00:32:45,963 --> 00:32:47,122
I knew that.

695
00:32:47,123 --> 00:32:48,789
No, you didn't.

696
00:32:50,701 --> 00:32:51,827
Okay.

697
00:32:57,307 --> 00:32:58,831
This is off.

698
00:33:00,811 --> 00:33:03,541
The lamp is in the same spot,
but the shadows aren't.

699
00:33:05,182 --> 00:33:06,911
And something else
is wrong.

700
00:33:08,952 --> 00:33:11,476
There are six pictures
on this bookshelf,

701
00:33:11,477 --> 00:33:13,886
there are six pictures
in this photo.

702
00:33:13,887 --> 00:33:15,082
What do you expect?

703
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:16,249
Seven.

704
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,156
I clearly remember
seven photos, Gus.

705
00:33:18,157 --> 00:33:21,629
<i>There were two pictures on
each shelf and one shelf with one.</i>

706
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:23,489
<i>That's seven.</i>

707
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:27,493
It was right here.
Where this box is.

708
00:33:27,938 --> 00:33:30,031
Can you remember
what's in the missing photo?

709
00:33:35,045 --> 00:33:36,376
I'm not...

710
00:33:36,813 --> 00:33:37,939
sure.

711
00:33:43,954 --> 00:33:46,148
What the hell is going on?
Nothing, man.

712
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,417
Nothing?

713
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:49,551
Is that guy dead?

714
00:33:49,552 --> 00:33:51,923
Damn it.
Now you've seen too much.

715
00:33:51,924 --> 00:33:53,461
I didn't see anything.

716
00:33:53,462 --> 00:33:56,623
Yeah, you did. You're in
this just as deep as I am now.

717
00:33:56,624 --> 00:33:58,166
We're gonna have
to work together.

718
00:33:58,167 --> 00:33:59,258
Okay?

719
00:33:59,259 --> 00:34:01,633
I assume this building
has an incinerator? Yeah?

720
00:34:01,634 --> 00:34:03,137
Yeah.
Okay.

721
00:34:03,138 --> 00:34:05,230
So we just have to
chop up the body

722
00:34:05,231 --> 00:34:07,367
and then we put the limbs
in little plastic baggies.

723
00:34:07,368 --> 00:34:09,104
The torso, we're gonna have
to melt down with a blow torch.

724
00:34:09,105 --> 00:34:10,237
Okay, I've heard enough.

725
00:34:12,916 --> 00:34:14,075
Chop up his body?

726
00:34:14,076 --> 00:34:16,016
And then you wonder
why I don't trust you?

727
00:34:16,887 --> 00:34:18,046
Are we done yet?

728
00:34:18,047 --> 00:34:19,645
One last thing.

729
00:34:24,895 --> 00:34:26,157
Hurry up, Shawn.

730
00:34:41,378 --> 00:34:44,141
Shawn, I left my retreat to solve
a crime, not to order takeout.

731
00:34:44,142 --> 00:34:45,646
That's exactly
what we're doing.

732
00:34:45,647 --> 00:34:48,240
Hi, there. What time do
you turn those lights on?

733
00:34:48,241 --> 00:34:50,512
At 5:00, for the beginning
of the dinner crowd.

734
00:34:50,513 --> 00:34:53,078
Never any earlier for
any reason whatsoever?

735
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:54,846
It's on a timer.

736
00:34:54,847 --> 00:34:56,084
What the hell is the point?

737
00:34:56,085 --> 00:34:57,591
I think I know
who the killer is.

738
00:34:57,592 --> 00:35:00,425
Just one more question. And
this is absolutely critical.

739
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:08,165
Do your samosas come
with that red onion chutney?

740
00:35:10,841 --> 00:35:12,102
I arraigned
Felix today.

741
00:35:12,103 --> 00:35:13,573
If he's smart
he'll just plead out.

742
00:35:13,574 --> 00:35:15,543
Next is the...

743
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:17,773
Jimminy Crickets. What?

744
00:35:17,774 --> 00:35:19,712
He's sensing an anomaly
in the space-time continuum.

745
00:35:19,713 --> 00:35:20,908
Oh, it's very serious.

746
00:35:20,909 --> 00:35:22,780
They can unravel
the fabric of reality itself.

747
00:35:22,781 --> 00:35:26,084
We've been trailing it from across
town. The distortion is near.

748
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:29,122
Bless you.

749
00:35:29,123 --> 00:35:30,453
Thank you.

750
00:35:30,454 --> 00:35:32,722
It's in the photos
in the file!

751
00:35:35,565 --> 00:35:39,934
Yes. The photos are lying.
That is the anomaly.

752
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:43,998
It was the distortion that prevented me
from divining dirty Deanna's attacker.

753
00:35:43,999 --> 00:35:45,302
But now,

754
00:35:46,076 --> 00:35:47,474
now I have a clear image.

755
00:35:47,475 --> 00:35:48,908
We already know
who attacked her.

756
00:35:48,909 --> 00:35:50,377
He's right, Mr. Spencer.

757
00:35:50,378 --> 00:35:51,812
He's wrong.

758
00:35:53,917 --> 00:35:55,646
The bludgeoner is close.

759
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:57,416
Follow me.

760
00:36:07,497 --> 00:36:09,328
Yes! No! No.

761
00:36:16,573 --> 00:36:17,630
Bludgeoner.

762
00:36:17,631 --> 00:36:19,698
What, are you nuts?
He works for us!

763
00:36:21,278 --> 00:36:22,369
The photos.

764
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:24,436
Look at the
photos. Jules, Jules, Jules,

765
00:36:24,437 --> 00:36:27,004
what's going on with the lights
in the background, in the window?

766
00:36:27,005 --> 00:36:29,950
Oh, he's right. The lights in the
restaurant are on in these photos.

767
00:36:29,951 --> 00:36:31,611
They were off
when we found Deanna.

768
00:36:31,612 --> 00:36:32,915
What?
This is crazy.

769
00:36:32,916 --> 00:36:34,922
Why would I attack some
woman I've never met before?

770
00:36:34,923 --> 00:36:37,891
Never met? Didn't you photograph her
house when that Felix guy broke in?

771
00:36:37,892 --> 00:36:40,326
Yes, that's when
you met her then. Dude!

772
00:36:40,327 --> 00:36:42,387
She liked meeting new people.
And she liked to party.

773
00:36:42,388 --> 00:36:43,830
And she liked to have
her photo taken.

774
00:36:43,831 --> 00:36:46,561
And guess who takes
photos for a living. You!

775
00:36:46,562 --> 00:36:48,159
And it was nice,
and it was on,

776
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,932
and you were giving it
to her, and she liked it.

777
00:36:49,933 --> 00:36:54,442
Until she met somebody who could afford
to buy her nicer jewelry than you.

778
00:36:54,443 --> 00:36:56,272
She was on her way
to see him in Tokyo.

779
00:36:56,273 --> 00:36:58,370
You decided to confront her
at her apartment.

780
00:36:58,371 --> 00:37:00,211
<i>Hey, trophy!</i>

781
00:37:08,558 --> 00:37:10,355
And then
you cleaned it all up,

782
00:37:12,896 --> 00:37:16,422
and you made it nice, and you
left a perfect crime scene.

783
00:37:16,423 --> 00:37:20,025
Then you came back here, and assumed
your capacity as police photographer.

784
00:37:21,371 --> 00:37:22,997
You scrutinized the photos,

785
00:37:22,998 --> 00:37:26,839
<i>making sure there was no trace
of your presence in that apartment.</i>

786
00:37:28,844 --> 00:37:30,242
Oversight.

787
00:37:30,243 --> 00:37:34,339
This bag. Sure enough,
in a photo on her bookshelf.

788
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,451
Your bag with your initials,

789
00:37:36,452 --> 00:37:38,384
that the police have seen
a million times.

790
00:37:38,385 --> 00:37:40,081
They'd have known it was you.
So what did you do?

791
00:37:40,082 --> 00:37:43,092
You waited for the forensics guys
to split, and you snuck back inside.

792
00:37:43,293 --> 00:37:45,158
<i>You were meticulous.</i>

793
00:37:45,362 --> 00:37:48,489
<i>You took the time to turn the
clocks back to the right time,</i>

794
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:52,466
<i>and you re-photographed the whole
scene without the incriminating photo.</i>

795
00:37:52,467 --> 00:37:55,232
<i>And you re-submitted those
as the originals.</i>

796
00:37:57,107 --> 00:37:58,664
But I can feel
that you forgot

797
00:37:58,665 --> 00:38:02,178
to reset the clocks to the
correct time before leaving.

798
00:38:06,249 --> 00:38:07,614
Oh, Gus.

799
00:38:14,324 --> 00:38:17,885
Take him into custody until
we figure this whole thing out.

800
00:38:26,303 --> 00:38:28,931
So the
prophecy has been fulfilled.

801
00:38:32,042 --> 00:38:34,441
What? What are you talking
about? What prophecy?

802
00:38:34,442 --> 00:38:38,140
Nothing. I just figured it was finally
my chance to say something dramatic.

803
00:38:46,389 --> 00:38:48,084
Father!

804
00:38:48,725 --> 00:38:49,884
Hey, Pop.

805
00:38:49,885 --> 00:38:51,427
Shawn, God...

806
00:38:52,529 --> 00:38:54,120
What are you,
sleeping one off?

807
00:38:54,121 --> 00:38:55,185
No.

808
00:38:55,186 --> 00:38:57,790
I couldn't sleep last night,
my back's all out of whack.

809
00:38:58,435 --> 00:39:00,198
Oh. God.

810
00:39:00,904 --> 00:39:05,170
Hey, I hear they arrested
one of the forensics guys.

811
00:39:05,408 --> 00:39:07,637
Yup. They grilled him
like panini.

812
00:39:07,638 --> 00:39:09,439
He confessed
to the whole thing.

813
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,241
And the police found a fake
hospital badge at his apartment.

814
00:39:12,242 --> 00:39:14,340
They think he was gonna
try to kill her last night.

815
00:39:14,718 --> 00:39:15,843
How's the girl?

816
00:39:15,844 --> 00:39:18,012
The doctors say
she's gonna pull through.

817
00:39:19,089 --> 00:39:20,350
There he is!

818
00:39:20,351 --> 00:39:22,481
Well, you're here, but you're not
gonna go out like that, are you?

819
00:39:22,482 --> 00:39:26,188
Yeah, I can't make it tonight.
I gotta work a double.

820
00:39:26,496 --> 00:39:28,759
Hey, I know. Why don't
you take Junior here?

821
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,991
I'll catch you next week.

822
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:33,502
What are
you talking about?

823
00:39:34,104 --> 00:39:37,004
Didn't you just work back-to-back
shifts on that tennis thing?

824
00:39:37,005 --> 00:39:38,664
Okay, fine. You got me.

825
00:39:38,665 --> 00:39:42,108
All right. He's actually capable of
taking all the fun out of fishing.

826
00:39:42,109 --> 00:39:44,407
He criticized my pole
technique for like three hours.

827
00:39:44,408 --> 00:39:46,675
It's holding a pole in the
water. What is there to criticize?

828
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:49,809
Hey, ease up. That's my pop
you're talking about.

829
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:52,480
I'm beginning to understand
you a little better, Spencer.

830
00:39:56,259 --> 00:39:58,158
Burton, you're back.

831
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:00,024
Sorry I missed
today's program, sir.

832
00:40:00,025 --> 00:40:01,654
Well, it's okay.

833
00:40:02,399 --> 00:40:04,161
I tried out
a new trust exercise

834
00:40:04,162 --> 00:40:06,064
where I pull a rubber
band back as far as I can

835
00:40:06,065 --> 00:40:08,194
and hold it up to my trust
partner's eye, and I say,

836
00:40:08,195 --> 00:40:10,067
"Do you trust me?
Do you trust me?"

837
00:40:10,068 --> 00:40:11,971
Wow. How did that go?

838
00:40:13,743 --> 00:40:15,301
I wish my grip was better.

839
00:40:15,812 --> 00:40:17,870
But the cornea
is resilient.

840
00:40:17,871 --> 00:40:19,880
That's true, Tom,
I've heard that.

841
00:40:19,881 --> 00:40:23,475
Now, Burton here hates to drag his
personal life into work matters,

842
00:40:23,476 --> 00:40:25,315
but I feel like
you should know,

843
00:40:25,316 --> 00:40:29,721
his dear grandmother somehow managed
to dislocate both of her shoulders, too.

844
00:40:29,722 --> 00:40:33,228
I think it was the chin-ups she was
trying to do on the traction bar.

845
00:40:33,229 --> 00:40:34,589
Burton,

846
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:37,632
you have missed almost every exercise
we had arranged for this weekend.

847
00:40:37,633 --> 00:40:40,328
You left a work function to
tend to your ailing grandmother,

848
00:40:40,329 --> 00:40:42,529
even if it was detrimental
to your career.

849
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:43,662
You know
what that tells me?

850
00:40:43,663 --> 00:40:45,901
Tells me you really care
about people.

851
00:40:46,276 --> 00:40:47,401
I do.
He does.

852
00:40:47,402 --> 00:40:49,501
And after getting in touch
with my feelings this weekend,

853
00:40:49,502 --> 00:40:52,069
I think that's exactly what the
Central Coast Pharmaceutical Company

854
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:53,205
is all about.

855
00:40:53,206 --> 00:40:54,511
Yes.
Okay.

856
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:59,714
Burton's grandmother is gonna
need a little extra caring after.

857
00:40:59,715 --> 00:41:01,949
He would never complain because
I know he loves his job,

858
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:04,288
but if there was any way that his
route could be a little less time...

859
00:41:04,289 --> 00:41:05,952
Save your breath.

860
00:41:05,953 --> 00:41:09,293
Burton, I know that everybody
here wants to get Dr. Magnotti,

861
00:41:09,294 --> 00:41:13,131
why don't you swap him out for a
couple of your less-productive clients?

862
00:41:13,132 --> 00:41:16,000
Oh, wow. Wow.
Thank you, Tom.

863
00:41:16,001 --> 00:41:17,971
And my grandmother thanks
you, as a matter of fact.

864
00:41:17,972 --> 00:41:20,372
Well, I'll tell you what.
Once she's feeling better,

865
00:41:20,373 --> 00:41:23,969
I want you two to come on over to my
house and have dinner with my wife and I.

866
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:26,640
Oh, no, we
couldn't. We couldn't.

867
00:41:26,641 --> 00:41:28,774
Lizzie makes a fondue
that'll knock your socks off.

868
00:41:28,775 --> 00:41:30,614
Block of cheese about
the size of a house cat.

869
00:41:30,615 --> 00:41:32,313
We're gonna melt it down
and gobble it up.

870
00:41:32,314 --> 00:41:34,413
Okay.
All right.

871
00:41:34,414 --> 00:41:36,720
Sure. We'd be honored. And
don't be such a stranger.

872
00:41:36,721 --> 00:41:39,091
Hello, Tom. Hello!

873
00:41:40,797 --> 00:41:42,161
I am so screwed.
Why?

874
00:41:42,162 --> 00:41:43,698
He wants to meet
my grandmother. So?

875
00:41:43,699 --> 00:41:46,326
So? You know that one of them is dead
and the other one lives in Jamaica.

876
00:41:46,327 --> 00:41:49,030
Dude, relax. I know like five people
that could easily play your grandmother.

877
00:41:49,031 --> 00:41:51,004
Okay, so you know
a line-dancing octogenarian

878
00:41:51,005 --> 00:41:52,904
who can do chin-ups
and has two broken hips?

879
00:41:52,905 --> 00:41:54,704
Yeah, as long as
she can be Chinese.

880
00:41:54,705 --> 00:41:56,802
Just trust me.
Never mind.

881
00:41:56,803 --> 00:41:58,642
Oh, you do trust me,
right?

882
00:41:58,643 --> 00:42:00,909
I mean, I know it's a silly thing
to say after all these years,

883
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:04,283
but we don't have to do these
kinds of exercises, do we?

884
00:42:05,588 --> 00:42:07,385
Battleship rematch?
No, that's all right.

885
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:19,529
<i>In between the lines
there's a lot of obscurity</i>

886
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:22,969
<i>I'm not inclined
to resign to maturity</i>

887
00:42:23,273 --> 00:42:26,537
<i>If it's all right
then you're all wrong</i>

888
00:42:26,538 --> 00:42:29,635
<i>But why bounce around
to the same damn song?</i>

889
00:42:31,214 --> 00:42:34,843
<i>You'd rather run
when you can't crawl</i>

890
00:42:37,387 --> 00:42:40,913
<i>I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth</i>

891
00:42:40,914 --> 00:42:44,220
<i>I know, you know
They just don't have any proof</i>

892
00:42:44,221 --> 00:42:47,228
<i>Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend</i>

893
00:42:47,229 --> 00:42:51,460
<i>Your worst inhibitions tend
to psych you out in the end</i>

894
00:42:51,461 --> 00:42:53,263
<i>I know, you know</i>

895
00:42:55,104 --> 00:42:56,799
<i>I know, you know</i>
