1
00:01:48,263 --> 00:01:49,364
Who is it?

2
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,796
You're not intimidated?

3
00:02:16,596 --> 00:02:19,097
Come on, Ken.
Are you forgetting that...

4
00:02:19,197 --> 00:02:22,030
...I'm one half of the world's
greatest mystery writing team.

5
00:02:22,563 --> 00:02:24,896
You don't have gloves on.

6
00:02:24,997 --> 00:02:29,030
Your finger's not on the trigger
and there are no bullets in the cylinder.

7
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:33,930
You're right.
I'm a lousy practical joker.

8
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,896
What are you doing here
with that thing anyway?

9
00:02:35,997 --> 00:02:37,429
I was on my way down to the cabin,

10
00:02:37,529 --> 00:02:39,730
I thought I could use it
for protection down there.

11
00:02:40,162 --> 00:02:41,763
I also came by to apologize.

12
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:44,663
For what?

13
00:02:44,962 --> 00:02:47,463
For blowing my cork the other day.
I got out of line.

14
00:02:48,696 --> 00:02:50,363
Forget it. That happens.

15
00:02:50,663 --> 00:02:53,529
No, it shouldn't happen.
Not between you and me.

16
00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:59,196
So, believe it or not, sir...
this is a peace pipe.

17
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:01,496
Bottoms up, Jim.

18
00:03:02,029 --> 00:03:03,628
In the middle of the morning?

19
00:03:03,895 --> 00:03:06,062
Oh, come on, relax. It's Saturday.

20
00:03:06,795 --> 00:03:10,862
In the mystery writer's soul,
it is always the middle of the night.

21
00:03:13,428 --> 00:03:16,862
A toast! Dear sir.

22
00:03:18,762 --> 00:03:19,895
I give you...

23
00:03:21,895 --> 00:03:23,096
...our divorce.

24
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,195
Well...it's not really a divorce.

25
00:03:34,295 --> 00:03:36,928
Oh, sure it is. Come on, let's be honest.
I mean, it...

26
00:03:37,028 --> 00:03:40,495
it's no alimony but it's a termination.

27
00:03:41,628 --> 00:03:45,295
Oh yes, and our dear little children.

28
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:47,595
All fifteen of them.

29
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:50,128
Fifty million copies.

30
00:03:50,928 --> 00:03:53,195
To the lady who made it all possible,

31
00:03:53,295 --> 00:03:56,295
the greatest sleuth in the world
Mrs.Melville.

32
00:03:56,794 --> 00:03:59,794
Whom we brought to life
and now we're about to bury.

33
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:03,128
Come on, Ken. You're making me feel
guilty.

34
00:04:03,694 --> 00:04:05,427
All I want to do is write on my own.

35
00:04:07,794 --> 00:04:09,694
You're right. I am being selfish.

36
00:04:10,294 --> 00:04:13,961
OK, my boy, my blessings.
On your solo flight.

37
00:04:14,794 --> 00:04:15,661
Thanks.

38
00:04:16,828 --> 00:04:17,894
I appreciate it.

39
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:24,461
After all, friendship is more
important than partnership, right?

40
00:04:26,761 --> 00:04:28,160
Here's to our friendship.

41
00:04:30,527 --> 00:04:31,427
Right.

42
00:04:35,361 --> 00:04:39,361
And now sir, I'm going to kidnap you.

43
00:04:39,693 --> 00:04:40,361
What?

44
00:04:40,461 --> 00:04:42,394
The aforementioned cabin, which has
been...

45
00:04:42,461 --> 00:04:44,260
...finished for over six months now.
You haven't seen it.

46
00:04:44,361 --> 00:04:45,660
You're going to be my first male
guest.

47
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,260
I can't, Ken. Not now.

48
00:04:47,361 --> 00:04:48,461
Why can't you?

49
00:04:49,361 --> 00:04:50,461
It's all the way down to San Diego.

50
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,793
Oh. It's a couple of hours' drive.
I'll have you home before midnight.

51
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,960
Yeah... I promised Joanna I'd
take her to dinner and a show.

52
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,260
Oh, that's easy. You pick up that
phone and you say,

53
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,660
"Honey, I'm going to be working late
at the office tonight." Come on.

54
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,460
As soon as we get down there, we'll uncork
another bottle and we'll go fishing.

55
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,027
Well, I can't...

56
00:05:05,127 --> 00:05:06,693
You know your trouble old buddy is?

57
00:05:06,793 --> 00:05:08,626
I mean, you're afraid to
unwind even for a day.

58
00:05:08,727 --> 00:05:09,560
Oh no, I'm not...

59
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,927
Then prove it.

60
00:05:11,426 --> 00:05:13,059
Come on, if you want some justification,

61
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:15,059
you're doing it as a favor for me.

62
00:05:15,159 --> 00:05:18,593
At least give me a chance to bury
the hatchet with some style.

63
00:05:18,727 --> 00:05:20,226
You just don't drop your partner...

64
00:05:20,326 --> 00:05:23,326
...and then turn down his invitation
all in one week now, do you?

65
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:26,226
Actually, the timing isn't bad.

66
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,993
I was just finishing the final
chapter.

67
00:05:28,093 --> 00:05:30,026
Ah, Mrs.Melville's last case.

68
00:05:30,326 --> 00:05:32,659
You know we ought to send that broad
some flowers.

69
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,526
I made a list of the things I'd like
to take from the office.

70
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:37,826
Do you want to take look at it?

71
00:05:40,059 --> 00:05:41,592
I don't get it. It's a list of names.

72
00:05:41,692 --> 00:05:43,826
I'm losing my mind. It's the wrong
one.

73
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,559
I must've left the other one
at the house.

74
00:05:48,093 --> 00:05:51,392
Ah...I am losing my mind.

75
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,592
What's the matter?

76
00:05:52,692 --> 00:05:53,926
I left my lighter in the office.

77
00:05:54,325 --> 00:05:54,993
Do you need it?

78
00:05:55,093 --> 00:05:57,592
That's my security blanket.
I'll only be a minute.

79
00:07:34,991 --> 00:07:39,623
And to think I had to talk you into
this trip. Jim, smell that air.

80
00:07:39,724 --> 00:07:40,724
How far is the cabin?

81
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:44,423
It's not far, about an hour.
We have to skirt San Diego.

82
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:04,290
I'll only be a minute. I just have to
get some supplies.

83
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,689
Do you want to hand me that book
in that glove compartment?

84
00:08:07,256 --> 00:08:08,557
Yeah, it's one of ours.

85
00:08:09,357 --> 00:08:11,256
The boss-lady here is a big fan of ours.

86
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,923
I've been promising this
for months. The price of fame.

87
00:08:14,023 --> 00:08:15,090
You want me to come with you?

88
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,489
No. I'll only be a minute.

89
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:30,656
Miss La Sanka?

90
00:08:33,823 --> 00:08:34,723
Anybody home?

91
00:08:34,823 --> 00:08:36,189
In a minute.

92
00:08:38,322 --> 00:08:39,889
Mr.Franklin.

93
00:08:40,622 --> 00:08:44,289
My planets must be in the right house.

94
00:08:44,955 --> 00:08:48,689
Not only that, but they're working
overtime. I have a surprise for you.

95
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:49,922
Pour moi?

96
00:08:50,022 --> 00:08:50,922
Pour moi.

97
00:08:51,755 --> 00:08:53,522
"Prescription: Murder"

98
00:08:53,955 --> 00:08:59,122
A Mrs.Melville thriller...
by James Ferris and Ken Franklin.

99
00:08:59,822 --> 00:09:01,456
Oh...take a look at the first page.

100
00:09:01,555 --> 00:09:06,255
You signed it, you dear man...
Well, Mr.Franklin.

101
00:09:07,855 --> 00:09:09,955
I'd rather have the storyteller
than the story.

102
00:09:10,688 --> 00:09:12,521
Well I tell you what.
If you play your cards right...

103
00:09:12,621 --> 00:09:15,321
...and give me my grocery list,
someday you may have both.

104
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:16,388
Empty promises.

105
00:09:16,488 --> 00:09:17,855
Miss La Sanka.

106
00:09:17,955 --> 00:09:19,155
What do you need?

107
00:09:19,254 --> 00:09:21,455
Just a few things for overnight.
Thanks.

108
00:09:26,955 --> 00:09:28,588
Who is it this week?
The blonde or the redhead?

109
00:09:28,688 --> 00:09:32,288
Miss La Sanka.
I'm all alone this weekend.

110
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,621
Except for some contemplation,

111
00:09:35,722 --> 00:09:37,321
some fishing, and the refreshment
of my spirit.

112
00:09:37,455 --> 00:09:38,921
Could you break this for me?

113
00:09:39,021 --> 00:09:41,321
I need some change for the phone.
Thanks very much.

114
00:09:43,521 --> 00:09:45,655
That'll do fine. Thank you.

115
00:09:59,121 --> 00:10:02,054
Operator? I'd like to place
a station to station call...

116
00:10:02,154 --> 00:10:04,854
...to Los Angeles, the area code is 213.

117
00:10:08,088 --> 00:10:08,921
Hello?

118
00:10:09,054 --> 00:10:11,088
<i>Joanna? It's Ken.</i>

119
00:10:11,187 --> 00:10:12,121
Oh, Ken.

120
00:10:13,153 --> 00:10:14,554
I thought you weren't talking to us.

121
00:10:14,787 --> 00:10:16,554
Oh, that's all patched up.

122
00:10:16,954 --> 00:10:19,821
As a matter of fact, I left Jim
at the office a few hours ago.

123
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:21,320
We signed an armistice.

124
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,454
Oh, that's a relief.

125
00:10:23,754 --> 00:10:26,087
Joanna, I wouldn't mention it to him.

126
00:10:26,187 --> 00:10:28,487
I'm sure he'd like to surprise you
himself.

127
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:31,053
<i>Why don't you join us for dinner
and we'll celebrate?</i>

128
00:10:31,153 --> 00:10:32,487
I'd really love to, but I'm...

129
00:10:32,587 --> 00:10:35,420
...spending the weekend down here
in San Diego at the cabin.

130
00:10:35,786 --> 00:10:37,720
<i>As a matter of fact, that's where
I'm calling from.</i>

131
00:10:38,587 --> 00:10:39,853
All right, then we'll do it
another time.

132
00:10:39,953 --> 00:10:41,220
<i>Absolutely.</i>

133
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:44,454
Joanna, I thought maybe if you...
for some reason,

134
00:10:44,553 --> 00:10:46,653
...needed to get in touch with me,
you do know the number of the cabin.

135
00:10:47,287 --> 00:10:48,020
Right.

136
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,987
<i>I'll see you in a few days.</i>

137
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,820
Fine. Goodbye.

138
00:11:05,453 --> 00:11:07,086
Do you ever get the feeling of
deja vu?

139
00:11:08,086 --> 00:11:08,920
What?

140
00:11:09,386 --> 00:11:13,453
Like you've done something before,
but you know you haven't?

141
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:15,553
Why? What do you mean?

142
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:18,820
I'm getting it right now.
It's strange.

143
00:11:20,219 --> 00:11:22,086
You know, I've never been here
before.

144
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:26,252
Maybe in a previous incarnation,
huh?

145
00:11:52,352 --> 00:11:53,785
Ken, it's fantastic.

146
00:11:53,885 --> 00:11:58,085
The house that Mrs.Melville built.
Wait'll you see the inside.

147
00:12:24,218 --> 00:12:25,085
It's no wonder...

148
00:12:26,352 --> 00:12:27,385
No wonder what?

149
00:12:28,318 --> 00:12:30,517
What woman could resist this
setting?

150
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:34,784
Not very many. I promise you that.
How about a drink, Jim?

151
00:12:34,884 --> 00:12:37,884
More alcohol? No, thanks. You'll
corrupt me.

152
00:12:42,085 --> 00:12:44,051
You're thinking about Joanna,
aren't you?

153
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:49,351
Yeah, you know... I mean just taking
off like that...

154
00:12:50,384 --> 00:12:51,651
She still expects me for dinner.

155
00:12:51,751 --> 00:12:54,517
We can fix that. We'll put plan A into
effect.

156
00:12:54,617 --> 00:12:56,017
Pick up the phone and call her.

157
00:12:56,851 --> 00:12:58,150
What am I going to tell her?

158
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,317
The man is too square for words.

159
00:13:00,451 --> 00:13:03,484
Now look. You simply say that you're
working at the office.

160
00:13:03,584 --> 00:13:04,850
You're calling from the office.

161
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,451
She knows you have a deadline to meet
with the book, you're working late.

162
00:13:07,551 --> 00:13:09,551
How many times
have you had to do that?

163
00:13:09,717 --> 00:13:10,617
A couple of hundred, I guess.

164
00:13:10,717 --> 00:13:12,584
Exactly. That's why she'll believe
you.

165
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,517
Yeah... I just hate lying to her.

166
00:13:15,616 --> 00:13:18,184
You're not lying to her. You're saving
her a little anguish.

167
00:13:18,284 --> 00:13:21,616
Now will you pick up the phone and call
her so we can start enjoying ourselves.

168
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:22,550
OK...

169
00:13:29,117 --> 00:13:30,250
Operator, I'd like to make a...

170
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,483
Hold it.

171
00:13:33,883 --> 00:13:36,383
It's a cinch you have never cheated on
Joanna before.

172
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,950
If you want your wife to believe
you're calling from the office...

173
00:13:39,116 --> 00:13:40,883
you don't have the operator place
the call.

174
00:13:40,984 --> 00:13:44,049
You dial her direct, the area code
is 213.

175
00:14:01,183 --> 00:14:02,249
Hi, honey?

176
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,049
How are you...

177
00:14:07,016 --> 00:14:11,083
Yeah, well, that's why I'm calling
about it...I'm at the office.

178
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,816
I'm pretty well into this last chapter
and I'd like to work straight through.

179
00:14:15,482 --> 00:14:18,415
I know, I know.

180
00:14:19,682 --> 00:14:21,916
This will be the last time. That I
can...

181
00:14:23,816 --> 00:14:24,716
Jimmy?

182
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,248
Jimmy!

183
00:14:38,315 --> 00:14:41,749
Operator, get me the police!

184
00:15:23,815 --> 00:15:28,681
Hello Joanna?...What?

185
00:15:30,881 --> 00:15:31,848
Joanna.

186
00:15:33,247 --> 00:15:36,047
Will you take it easy.
Now say it again once more.

187
00:15:37,847 --> 00:15:39,147
Are you sure?

188
00:15:41,214 --> 00:15:42,448
Did you call the police?

189
00:15:44,348 --> 00:15:47,047
Yes, of course.
I'll leave right away.

190
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:52,214
Joanna, please take it easy.

191
00:15:53,081 --> 00:15:54,447
And don't worry.

192
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,547
I'm sure it's nothing but a
practical joke. Goodbye.

193
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:34,280
I know it's insane... I just I...
I...I keep thinking of cliches.

194
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:40,779
And Jim and Ken wrote this scene
in their books a hundred times.

195
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,746
Look at it this way, Mrs.Ferris.

196
00:16:42,846 --> 00:16:45,380
Maybe he isn't dead. There is no
body, no blood...

197
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:50,412
No, he was shot! I know it!
I heard it on the phone.

198
00:16:50,913 --> 00:16:52,913
This place was searched, Mrs.
Ferris.

199
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,980
Papers on the floor.
Any idea why?

200
00:16:55,312 --> 00:16:56,879
No, I have no idea.

201
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,412
Did you notice anything special,
missing something?

202
00:17:01,112 --> 00:17:02,346
You're sure it was his voice?

203
00:17:02,446 --> 00:17:06,646
Yes. I know it was his voice.
And maybe somebody...

204
00:17:06,746 --> 00:17:09,012
Was he under any kind of extra
pressure or anything?

205
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,346
No, maybe somebody was...

206
00:17:11,746 --> 00:17:12,945
Did he say where he called from?

207
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:16,079
Yes, he said he was calling
from the office.

208
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:18,878
He said "I'm calling from the
office."

209
00:17:18,979 --> 00:17:21,679
I really don't care if
anything was missing.

210
00:17:21,778 --> 00:17:24,945
I just really want to find out
what happened to my husband.

211
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:26,678
Are you sure it was his voice?

212
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:28,279
I know it was his voice.

213
00:17:28,379 --> 00:17:29,379
Are you sure it was a gun shot?

214
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:30,179
Yes, that's right.

215
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:31,645
Would you like to sit down and
get a glass of water?

216
00:17:31,745 --> 00:17:37,478
Yes, I would like. Really, please
'cause I'm not really sure what to do.

217
00:17:37,578 --> 00:17:39,346
I just really want to clear my head.

218
00:17:58,278 --> 00:18:00,044
I think that's out of order,
ma'am.

219
00:18:00,144 --> 00:18:03,611
You see, that's the trouble with these
buildings. The fountains never work.

220
00:18:03,712 --> 00:18:06,311
Then you have to use the coffee
machine.

221
00:18:06,812 --> 00:18:09,712
And then you lose your dime and the
coffee's lousy.

222
00:18:09,811 --> 00:18:10,645
Who are you?

223
00:18:10,744 --> 00:18:14,478
I'm just another cop. My name is
Columbo. I'm a lieutenant.

224
00:18:15,911 --> 00:18:17,345
I've got the proof right here.

225
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:20,577
You didn't see me in there.

226
00:18:20,677 --> 00:18:23,777
Because I left before you got in
there.

227
00:18:23,877 --> 00:18:28,677
You know why? Because it's so smoky
in there. And so noisy in there.

228
00:18:28,777 --> 00:18:30,644
That I just had to come outside and
get a breath.

229
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:31,911
Oh...I think I'd better get back.

230
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:34,477
No, wait a minute. Let me tell you
something.

231
00:18:34,744 --> 00:18:36,277
You look very tired to me.

232
00:18:36,377 --> 00:18:38,978
I think you had a terrible
experience in there.

233
00:18:39,677 --> 00:18:43,078
And I think I ought to drive you
home. Let's call it a night.

234
00:18:43,444 --> 00:18:45,610
Don't you think they want to ask
me questions?

235
00:18:46,077 --> 00:18:47,677
I don't think they'll mind.

236
00:18:47,777 --> 00:18:49,711
I think you've answered enough
questions.

237
00:18:49,811 --> 00:18:51,911
And I'll call them and
I'll tell them you're with me.

238
00:18:52,444 --> 00:18:55,444
What about Ken?
Why isn't Ken here?

239
00:18:56,777 --> 00:18:58,377
I don't know why he isn't here.

240
00:18:58,477 --> 00:19:00,876
Is that Mr.Franklin, the other
half of the writing team?

241
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:06,077
Yeah, the other half of the team.

242
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:10,243
You know that's what I like about
these buttons.

243
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:13,876
You don't have to push them. They
go off with the heat of your hand.

244
00:19:15,177 --> 00:19:17,177
I'll bet you haven't had anything to
eat...

245
00:19:25,276 --> 00:19:28,810
You're a very nice man, Lieutenant.
But I'm not really hungry.

246
00:19:29,443 --> 00:19:32,743
I'll tell you, Mrs.Ferris, I'm the
worst cook in the world.

247
00:19:33,343 --> 00:19:36,343
But there's one thing I do terrific,
and that's an omelette.

248
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:37,576
Even my wife admits it.

249
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:40,142
Uh...I need something for the egg shells.

250
00:19:40,242 --> 00:19:41,443
Over there in that cabinet.

251
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:45,343
I'm really not hungry.

252
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:49,842
Listen, you take a taste. If you
don't like it, you throw it away.

253
00:19:50,609 --> 00:19:54,909
I tell you what the secret is to a
good omelette. No eggs, just milk.

254
00:19:55,976 --> 00:19:57,775
A skillet.

255
00:19:58,409 --> 00:19:59,343
Over there.

256
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:04,176
You're a very persuasive man,
Lieutenant.

257
00:20:04,508 --> 00:20:06,575
Maybe I should hold up my end
and make the coffee.

258
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,009
Cheese and onions.

259
00:20:18,109 --> 00:20:19,642
And butter.

260
00:20:22,142 --> 00:20:24,275
I need something to grate the cheese.

261
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,642
Over there in the cupboard.

262
00:20:26,608 --> 00:20:27,408
Right.

263
00:20:36,874 --> 00:20:39,108
What did they do with him,
Lieutenant?

264
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,408
I don't know, ma'am.

265
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,508
Well...there was no body in the
office.

266
00:20:44,608 --> 00:20:46,108
Couldn't that mean he isn't dead?

267
00:20:46,442 --> 00:20:49,542
Now, that's hard to say.
It's been botherin' me, too.

268
00:20:49,641 --> 00:20:52,108
I tell you the whole thing doesn't
make sense unless it's a kidnapping.

269
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,508
And you don't shoot your victim
first, do you?

270
00:20:55,975 --> 00:20:57,141
Why'd you laugh before?

271
00:20:57,241 --> 00:20:58,041
When?

272
00:20:58,474 --> 00:21:01,574
When I asked you if Mr.Franklin was
the other half of the writing team.

273
00:21:02,275 --> 00:21:03,507
Uh... Did I laugh?

274
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:08,208
Maybe it was the way you put it.
"Writing team".

275
00:21:09,341 --> 00:21:10,874
Maybe I shouldn't say it.

276
00:21:11,374 --> 00:21:15,008
But Ken hasn't written a word of
a Mrs.Melville novel in years.

277
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,307
Mrs.Melville? Who is Mrs.Melville?

278
00:21:17,841 --> 00:21:20,341
The character that
Jim and Ken created.

279
00:21:20,607 --> 00:21:23,040
The one who solves all the crimes
brilliantly.

280
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,574
Well... Why did your husband put up
with it?

281
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:29,541
What I mean is him doing
all the work?

282
00:21:29,641 --> 00:21:31,374
Well, there were compensations.

283
00:21:32,407 --> 00:21:35,873
Ken did the publicity. He went
on all the talk shows.

284
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,307
He did interviews, and cultivated
the film people...

285
00:21:40,707 --> 00:21:42,040
He contributed.

286
00:21:43,573 --> 00:21:45,107
He just didn't do any of writing.

287
00:21:45,207 --> 00:21:48,940
Boy, I tell you, I'd love to be a
writer. That's a terrific talent.

288
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:50,873
Where'd he get all the ideas?

289
00:21:51,673 --> 00:21:53,240
From almost anything.

290
00:21:53,873 --> 00:21:58,107
People, magazines, conversations.

291
00:21:59,573 --> 00:22:02,773
I'm constantly finding scraps of
paper and old matchbook covers...

292
00:22:02,907 --> 00:22:06,239
...just all over the house
with notes and ideas.

293
00:22:06,673 --> 00:22:08,907
And those were mysteries too,
weren't they, huh?

294
00:22:09,807 --> 00:22:13,540
They're tricky. I'll tell you that
I could never figure those things out.

295
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,440
It got harder.

296
00:22:16,306 --> 00:22:18,740
Maybe that's why he decided to go
out on his own.

297
00:22:18,872 --> 00:22:20,540
Oh, really? I didn't know that.

298
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:22,440
I guess he wanted to do some serious
work.

299
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,939
No kidding.

300
00:22:24,806 --> 00:22:26,772
How did Mr.Franklin take that?

301
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:29,872
Not very well.

302
00:22:31,606 --> 00:22:32,839
But he'll get over it.

303
00:22:34,106 --> 00:22:35,639
Gee, I'd hate to be in his shoes.

304
00:22:35,739 --> 00:22:36,506
Why?

305
00:22:37,073 --> 00:22:39,073
Well, you got a writing team, and
they're very famous.

306
00:22:39,173 --> 00:22:41,073
Now they break up.
And what happens?

307
00:22:41,173 --> 00:22:44,106
One fellow continues writing books
and the other fellow just stops.

308
00:22:45,206 --> 00:22:46,739
That's what I keep telling Jim.

309
00:22:47,872 --> 00:22:50,305
That sooner or later, people were
bound to find out.

310
00:22:51,272 --> 00:22:52,906
What? That your husband did all the
writing?

311
00:22:53,006 --> 00:22:53,706
Yeah.

312
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:54,572
Yeah.

313
00:22:56,706 --> 00:22:59,039
Kinda tough on Mr.Franklin's ego.

314
00:23:28,504 --> 00:23:29,571
Ken...

315
00:23:30,771 --> 00:23:33,404
I know, I know. Just take it easy.

316
00:23:34,105 --> 00:23:37,338
I drove up here as fast as I could.
Is there anything new?

317
00:23:37,438 --> 00:23:38,604
No. Not yet.

318
00:23:39,805 --> 00:23:43,771
Jo, it's incredible. I just saw him
this morning at the office...

319
00:23:44,972 --> 00:23:49,438
Oh...I'm sorry, Ken. Lieutenant Columbo.
Mr.Franklin.

320
00:23:50,204 --> 00:23:51,038
How you doing?

321
00:23:51,137 --> 00:23:53,237
The question is, how are you doing,
Lieutenant?

322
00:23:53,571 --> 00:23:55,604
Well, I'm afraid we just got
started.

323
00:23:56,905 --> 00:23:58,304
Has Jim been found yet?

324
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,538
Has he been found yet?

325
00:24:02,204 --> 00:24:03,738
Why? Did somebody tell you
he was gone?

326
00:24:04,071 --> 00:24:07,438
Lieutenant, I just spent several
hours driving up here from San Diego.

327
00:24:07,538 --> 00:24:09,638
You must know the story is
on every news station.

328
00:24:10,037 --> 00:24:12,704
Oh, right, yeah, gee.
I shoulda thought of that.

329
00:24:13,304 --> 00:24:14,571
Well, has he been found?

330
00:24:14,837 --> 00:24:16,004
I'm afraid not.

331
00:24:16,237 --> 00:24:18,704
What were you, visiting friends
in San Diego?

332
00:24:18,804 --> 00:24:20,670
He has a place there.
A cabin.

333
00:24:20,804 --> 00:24:23,104
Away for the weekend, gee.
That's nice.

334
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,171
Could we get back to my
question?

335
00:24:25,271 --> 00:24:27,104
Have you come up with any
leads, any clues?

336
00:24:27,204 --> 00:24:29,737
Uh... It's a little early for that.

337
00:24:29,837 --> 00:24:33,270
Early? Seems to me your men are
standing around just marking time.

338
00:24:34,104 --> 00:24:34,837
Could I have a drink, love?

339
00:24:35,737 --> 00:24:37,337
I could use one myself.

340
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,437
I'll tell you something, Lieutenant.

341
00:24:43,737 --> 00:24:45,804
See if Mrs.Melville were on this
case,

342
00:24:45,904 --> 00:24:48,770
she would be leaps and bounds
ahead of you by now.

343
00:24:49,236 --> 00:24:50,603
Is that the lady in the books?

344
00:24:50,704 --> 00:24:51,570
That's right.

345
00:24:53,437 --> 00:24:56,803
You see she would have figured it out
that this is not just someone missing.

346
00:24:57,337 --> 00:24:59,103
This is a professional killing.

347
00:25:10,569 --> 00:25:13,469
Aha! Here it is.

348
00:25:16,003 --> 00:25:16,903
Take a look at that.

349
00:25:17,003 --> 00:25:20,469
Uh... Put it on the desk. Just drop
it 'cause of the fingerprints, you know.

350
00:25:20,803 --> 00:25:23,336
Jim's fingerprints are all over
that. So are mine.

351
00:25:26,602 --> 00:25:27,402
What is it?

352
00:25:27,936 --> 00:25:29,070
What does it look like?

353
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:31,636
It's a list of names. Look at that.

354
00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:34,736
Musto, Delgado, Hathaway, Westlake...

355
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:36,169
Sound familiar?

356
00:25:36,736 --> 00:25:38,102
Yeah...Kind of.

357
00:25:38,202 --> 00:25:39,302
They should.

358
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:42,769
That's a list of some of the top men
in organized crime on the west coast.

359
00:25:42,868 --> 00:25:44,302
L.A., Vegas, Frisco...

360
00:25:44,402 --> 00:25:45,469
I don't understand.

361
00:25:46,269 --> 00:25:50,602
It's painfully obvious.
One of these men had Jim killed.

362
00:25:50,935 --> 00:25:52,636
Really? Why?

363
00:25:53,768 --> 00:25:57,202
Tell me something. How long have you
been a lieutenant, Lieutenant?

364
00:25:57,302 --> 00:25:59,668
Mrs.Melville would have put that
together like that.

365
00:25:59,868 --> 00:26:03,336
Well look, I'm gonna take all the help
I can get.

366
00:26:03,802 --> 00:26:05,735
All right. Let me see if I can
explain it to you.

367
00:26:06,868 --> 00:26:10,102
See my partner and I decided to
split, go our separate ways.

368
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:12,102
I'm sure Joanna must've mentioned
that to you.

369
00:26:12,202 --> 00:26:13,902
Yeah, she said something about that.

370
00:26:14,002 --> 00:26:15,501
Did she also mention the fact...

371
00:26:15,601 --> 00:26:18,002
...that Jim wanted to do some
serious writing?

372
00:26:19,301 --> 00:26:21,802
Hey, wait a minute...

373
00:26:21,902 --> 00:26:23,068
Dawning on you now?

374
00:26:23,268 --> 00:26:26,368
Knew you'd get it. But that's only
the tip of the iceberg.

375
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:29,968
You see, Jim was researching a complete
and factual expose...

376
00:26:30,068 --> 00:26:31,802
...of all west coast
organized crime.

377
00:26:31,901 --> 00:26:34,901
I mean he was going around asking
some pretty embarrassing questions.

378
00:26:35,134 --> 00:26:37,568
Probing, compiling dossiers.

379
00:26:37,702 --> 00:26:39,401
That's why they searched this office.

380
00:26:39,801 --> 00:26:42,368
Apparently they got everything but
that list.

381
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,435
And you think one of these fellas
put out a contract on him?

382
00:26:45,767 --> 00:26:49,034
Of course. Word must've gotten around that
Jim was compiling all this information.

383
00:26:49,134 --> 00:26:51,734
They knew they couldn't buy him off,
so what did they do?

384
00:26:51,834 --> 00:26:54,001
They chose the usual alternative.

385
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:56,234
A professional killing, huh?

386
00:26:56,834 --> 00:26:59,734
But if that's true, why did they get
rid of the body?

387
00:27:00,301 --> 00:27:04,334
Who knows? But remember one thing
without a corpus delicti...

388
00:27:04,701 --> 00:27:06,901
you can't prove a murder was
committed in the first place.

389
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:09,200
But why would a professional killer
care?

390
00:27:09,334 --> 00:27:11,901
I mean, he's already on a plane
back from where he came.

391
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:14,300
Lieutenant, I can't answer all of
your questions.

392
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,934
I've given you a list of the most
likely suspects, a clear motive.

393
00:27:18,133 --> 00:27:19,634
Isn't that enough to start with?

394
00:27:19,834 --> 00:27:20,834
Oh, that's plenty.

395
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:24,267
Believe me I'm very grateful for
all the help you've given me.

396
00:27:27,334 --> 00:27:28,701
Gee, that's funny...

397
00:27:29,067 --> 00:27:29,766
What?

398
00:27:30,367 --> 00:27:32,267
This thing is folded lengthwise.

399
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:34,933
Like someone was carrying it
in their pocket.

400
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:35,933
So?

401
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,933
Well, if he typed that on that
typewriter,

402
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,500
and I'll run a check on that,

403
00:27:42,233 --> 00:27:44,866
why would he fold it up before he
put it in that drawer?

404
00:27:46,533 --> 00:27:48,967
I'm beginning to like you.

405
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:49,933
Why is that?

406
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:53,133
Because you're finally beginning to
think like Mrs.Melville.

407
00:27:54,167 --> 00:27:56,499
Unfortunately, Jim used to fold up
a piece of paper,

408
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:59,232
and he'd use it as a bookmark,
you know.

409
00:27:59,633 --> 00:28:01,900
Now however interesting your
observation is,

410
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,933
it only leads us far astray.

411
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:08,800
However, since you are beginning to
learn how to emulate our dear lady,

412
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:11,833
I'm going to give you
something that you richly deserve.

413
00:28:11,932 --> 00:28:14,199
A chance to read some of our books.

414
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,633
Well, that's very nice of you.

415
00:28:16,733 --> 00:28:17,966
Didn't expect gifts tonight, huh?

416
00:28:18,066 --> 00:28:20,899
Thank you. Maybe I can pick up
a few pointers.

417
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,533
I'm sure you can.

418
00:28:22,966 --> 00:28:24,132
Could you handle some more?

419
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:25,266
All right.

420
00:28:25,366 --> 00:28:26,166
Here you go.

421
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:27,699
Oh, and an extra.

422
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:28,665
That's very nice.

423
00:28:28,765 --> 00:28:30,665
That ought to keep you busy
for a while, huh?

424
00:28:31,433 --> 00:28:33,166
Anything else, Lieutenant?

425
00:28:33,765 --> 00:28:35,999
No, I don't think so. I think
I'd better let you get some sleep.

426
00:28:36,099 --> 00:28:39,066
That's very nice of you. I just
only hope I was of some help.

427
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:40,232
Oh, you certainly were.

428
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:41,966
Well, good night Lieutenant.

429
00:28:42,066 --> 00:28:42,765
Good night, sir.

430
00:28:43,699 --> 00:28:45,265
Oh Mr.Franklin. Uh...

431
00:28:46,365 --> 00:28:51,032
Actually, there is one thing.
Not that it makes that much difference.

432
00:28:51,265 --> 00:28:52,066
What is it?

433
00:28:53,032 --> 00:28:56,032
When Mrs.Ferris called you and told
you her husband got shot,

434
00:28:56,131 --> 00:28:59,131
you jumped in a car and drove
right back to L.A., is that right?

435
00:28:59,699 --> 00:29:00,632
That's right.

436
00:29:01,131 --> 00:29:03,098
You know, me, I woulda taken a plane.

437
00:29:03,398 --> 00:29:06,065
I mean, it's a big airport and they
run every half hour.

438
00:29:06,165 --> 00:29:07,632
It would have been a lot faster.

439
00:29:08,465 --> 00:29:09,998
Well, I, that's true.

440
00:29:10,098 --> 00:29:13,098
But...in a situation like that,
who thinks clearly?

441
00:29:13,398 --> 00:29:14,864
And look at it this way.

442
00:29:15,098 --> 00:29:18,565
You add up all the time it takes
to drive to and from an airport.

443
00:29:18,664 --> 00:29:20,432
How much time do you really save?

444
00:30:13,596 --> 00:30:17,197
Operator? Get me the police, please.
Thank you.

445
00:30:22,264 --> 00:30:23,763
Lieutenant Columbo, please.

446
00:30:26,296 --> 00:30:27,663
Yes, thank you. I'll wait.

447
00:30:33,797 --> 00:30:34,630
Columbo?

448
00:30:35,396 --> 00:30:36,463
This is Franklin.

449
00:30:37,296 --> 00:30:39,196
I think you'd better get over here
right away.

450
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,897
937 Sky View Drive.

451
00:30:44,029 --> 00:30:45,330
It's an emergency.

452
00:31:16,529 --> 00:31:18,096
When I got home, there he...

453
00:31:18,896 --> 00:31:20,996
There it was right in the middle of
the lawn.

454
00:31:23,762 --> 00:31:25,595
Terrible thing to come home to.

455
00:31:27,829 --> 00:31:34,228
The funny thing is, I kept hoping,
I was sure that Jim was still alive.

456
00:31:35,529 --> 00:31:36,629
Poor Joanna...

457
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,762
Every time I think of feeling sorry
for myself,

458
00:31:40,861 --> 00:31:42,696
I think of how much she had
to lose.

459
00:31:46,828 --> 00:31:47,761
Look at them.

460
00:31:49,761 --> 00:31:50,928
Vultures.

461
00:31:52,028 --> 00:31:57,429
Lieutenant, you mind if I go inside.
I can't stand to watch them...gape.

462
00:31:57,594 --> 00:31:59,262
Mind if I come with you because...

463
00:31:59,362 --> 00:32:01,561
...there's no lining on this coat
and it's a bit chilly.

464
00:32:01,661 --> 00:32:02,661
I don't mind.

465
00:32:15,194 --> 00:32:19,161
Hello, yes, this is Mr.Franklin.

466
00:32:20,194 --> 00:32:22,594
What? No comment.

467
00:32:24,094 --> 00:32:26,461
You got to be kidding.
What, an interview now?

468
00:32:30,528 --> 00:32:32,094
The gentlemen of the press.

469
00:32:32,328 --> 00:32:33,927
Afraid you're gonna get a lot of
that.

470
00:32:36,361 --> 00:32:39,660
I'm sorry, Lieutenant. I'm forgetting
my manners. Would you like a drink?

471
00:32:40,061 --> 00:32:42,660
Yeah...well...maybe a drop of bourbon.

472
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:43,860
Bourbon.

473
00:32:46,494 --> 00:32:47,927
Boy, this is quite a place.

474
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,894
This a copy?

475
00:32:51,961 --> 00:32:53,560
Hardly. It's an original.

476
00:32:55,261 --> 00:32:57,427
Gee, I thought they only hung this
stuff in the museums.

477
00:32:58,227 --> 00:32:59,227
You own this?

478
00:33:00,161 --> 00:33:01,894
Mrs.Melville has been very kind.

479
00:33:03,593 --> 00:33:06,994
Boy, quite a place.

480
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,660
And you got that other place
in San Diego.

481
00:33:10,694 --> 00:33:12,961
Gee, the upkeep alone must be...

482
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,460
I manage to scrape by.

483
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,226
Your drink.

484
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,093
Thank you.

485
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,660
You know, there's one thing about
writers I don't understand.

486
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,260
Maybe you can help me clear it up.

487
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,260
If a fella's partner dies,

488
00:33:23,593 --> 00:33:27,160
does he own the other fella's
half of the books? Half of the uh...

489
00:33:28,093 --> 00:33:28,759
The Royalties?

490
00:33:28,859 --> 00:33:29,593
Yeah.

491
00:33:29,793 --> 00:33:30,527
No.

492
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,593
They go into the deceased's estate.

493
00:33:34,493 --> 00:33:36,960
That leaves you out in the cold,
doesn't it?

494
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,460
Unless you insured each other?

495
00:33:39,626 --> 00:33:42,459
Lieutenant, aren't we going a bit
far astray?

496
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,360
You're right. We shouldn't be
talking about this now.

497
00:33:45,492 --> 00:33:46,826
It's not the time.

498
00:33:49,859 --> 00:33:51,926
So Mr.Franklin, tell me.

499
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,526
Why do you think that they left your
partner's body...

500
00:33:55,626 --> 00:33:57,592
...out there on the lawn like that?

501
00:33:57,759 --> 00:33:59,693
Do you mean to tell me you haven't
figured that out?

502
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,526
Lieutenant, you disappoint me.

503
00:34:03,793 --> 00:34:05,292
It was left as a warning.

504
00:34:05,526 --> 00:34:06,359
A warning?

505
00:34:06,459 --> 00:34:07,326
Of course.

506
00:34:09,025 --> 00:34:12,392
It also proves my theory about
it being a professional killing.

507
00:34:13,059 --> 00:34:16,459
See, the moment they dropped Jim's
body in the middle of that lawn...

508
00:34:17,459 --> 00:34:18,725
Please sit down.

509
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:22,059
You know what they were saying?

510
00:34:23,192 --> 00:34:27,492
This could happen to you unless
you stop in your partner's research.

511
00:34:27,925 --> 00:34:29,159
They were trying to scare you.

512
00:34:29,492 --> 00:34:30,558
Exactly.

513
00:34:31,591 --> 00:34:33,825
Right. So what are you going to do?

514
00:34:34,292 --> 00:34:36,391
Are you going to continue writing
the book anyway?

515
00:34:36,558 --> 00:34:40,491
No. That's the irony of it. You see,
that was Jim's pet project, not mine.

516
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,525
I wouldn't even know where to begin.

517
00:34:44,224 --> 00:34:46,125
Say I guess they didn't have any way
of knowing...

518
00:34:46,224 --> 00:34:47,625
...you two were going to split up.

519
00:34:47,792 --> 00:34:48,625
No...

520
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:52,158
Even if they did, it wouldn't have
done Jim any good.

521
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:55,358
I must say, Lieutenant, you're up
against a dead end.

522
00:34:55,658 --> 00:34:59,258
Look at this. You've got a body,
you've got a motive.

523
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:01,991
But you're never going to find that
killer.

524
00:35:03,024 --> 00:35:04,325
It's not going to be easy.

525
00:35:05,558 --> 00:35:08,658
I'll lay you five to one it was
someone in Las Vegas or Miami,

526
00:35:08,757 --> 00:35:11,558
picked up a phone and put out
a contract.

527
00:35:11,658 --> 00:35:12,791
Right.

528
00:35:13,558 --> 00:35:17,491
How you're going to make a case,
much less solve one, is beyond me.

529
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,657
I guess the only thing I can do is...

530
00:35:19,757 --> 00:35:21,924
...just check out every name
on that list.

531
00:35:22,124 --> 00:35:23,724
Sure. You know what's going to
happen?

532
00:35:23,824 --> 00:35:26,424
Every one of those guys is
going to deny that Jim even existed?

533
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:27,358
Right.

534
00:35:28,091 --> 00:35:29,258
I must say I don't envy you.

535
00:35:29,357 --> 00:35:30,557
I don't envy myself.

536
00:35:31,357 --> 00:35:34,290
Now look, I got a lot of phone calls
to make. I'd better get on it.

537
00:35:34,524 --> 00:35:35,424
All the luck.

538
00:35:36,058 --> 00:35:38,357
Thanks. Thanks a lot, Mr.Franklin.

539
00:35:38,891 --> 00:35:41,223
And listen, I'm very sorry about
what happened tonight.

540
00:35:41,324 --> 00:35:42,223
Thank you.

541
00:35:46,457 --> 00:35:47,457
You...uh...

542
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:51,357
You will keep me posted, Lieutenant.

543
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:52,724
Oh, yes. I will. Yeah.

544
00:35:53,157 --> 00:35:55,757
You know, there is only one thing
that I'm not clear about.

545
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,923
But that can wait. You want to go to
bed.

546
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:02,023
Lieutenant, I'm not going to get any
sleep anyway. What is it?

547
00:36:03,023 --> 00:36:05,723
Would you go over for me once again?
I know you did it.

548
00:36:05,823 --> 00:36:08,490
Exactly what happened
when you came home tonight?

549
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:09,490
Sure. I've...

550
00:36:09,589 --> 00:36:10,923
I've already told you, but...

551
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:14,623
The moment I saw Jim's body
in the middle of the lawn...

552
00:36:14,723 --> 00:36:18,223
I came running in here and I picked
up the phone and I called you.

553
00:36:18,623 --> 00:36:20,823
I mean it's a purely reflexive
action.

554
00:36:21,556 --> 00:36:22,257
Uh-huh.

555
00:36:22,356 --> 00:36:25,157
Right. Uh-huh. Yeah, that's fine.

556
00:36:25,256 --> 00:36:26,057
Wait a minute,

557
00:36:26,157 --> 00:36:29,090
you look like you're troubled. Is there
some reason for your question?

558
00:36:29,523 --> 00:36:31,756
Ah, it's your mail.

559
00:36:32,556 --> 00:36:33,389
My mail?

560
00:36:33,623 --> 00:36:36,122
Isn't it funny how people are
different? Now me,

561
00:36:36,222 --> 00:36:39,589
if I found my partner dead, I'd
never think of opening my letters.

562
00:36:40,989 --> 00:36:44,289
But I just did it to distract myself.

563
00:36:44,389 --> 00:36:48,723
I mean you gotta remember one
thing, that's a great shock.

564
00:36:50,122 --> 00:36:53,623
Oh, that's understandable.
And bills are distracting.

565
00:36:53,889 --> 00:36:56,889
Listen, if anything comes up,
I'll call you right away.

566
00:36:57,556 --> 00:36:58,289
Good night.

567
00:36:59,222 --> 00:37:00,022
Good night.

568
00:37:15,122 --> 00:37:16,322
I'm going to have a hot-dog.

569
00:37:16,422 --> 00:37:17,956
Oh, I guess I will, too.

570
00:37:24,056 --> 00:37:27,221
Oh, no, Mr.Tucker. You put that
away. This one is on me.

571
00:37:30,555 --> 00:37:32,055
May I have a receipt, please?

572
00:37:33,988 --> 00:37:37,088
All right, Lieutenant, you're
bribing me with a handsome lunch.

573
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:38,322
What can I do for you?

574
00:37:38,455 --> 00:37:40,722
This is about an insurance
policy.

575
00:37:40,821 --> 00:37:43,388
Excellent! It's about time you came
to me.

576
00:37:43,488 --> 00:37:44,655
I can give you a...

577
00:37:44,788 --> 00:37:48,055
This is an insurance policy
that was already written.

578
00:37:49,788 --> 00:37:51,488
Oh. This is official business.

579
00:37:51,587 --> 00:37:56,422
Yeah. There are two mystery writers,
Ken Franklin and James Ferris.

580
00:37:57,121 --> 00:37:58,521
Your company wrote a policy on them?

581
00:37:58,688 --> 00:37:59,854
Now wait a minute, Lieutenant.

582
00:37:59,955 --> 00:38:01,921
We like to cooperate with
the police, but,

583
00:38:02,454 --> 00:38:04,321
if you want confidential information,
I'm afraid that you...

584
00:38:04,421 --> 00:38:07,587
Hold on, look. I don't want to cause
you any trouble.

585
00:38:07,721 --> 00:38:10,187
Maybe it would be more helpful
if I got a court order?

586
00:38:30,521 --> 00:38:34,220
Oh, Ken, it was simply marvelous.
I was terrified!

587
00:38:34,554 --> 00:38:35,454
Oh, really?

588
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,220
I had the whole thing figured out
by the end of the first act.

589
00:38:39,487 --> 00:38:43,586
You did? I was completely fooled.
You must have a devious mind.

590
00:38:43,687 --> 00:38:45,687
No dear, it's because you're young.

591
00:38:46,087 --> 00:38:47,687
Always remember one thing, my love.

592
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,553
The moment a man mentions a
long-lost twin,

593
00:38:51,653 --> 00:38:55,420
you can inevitably know that
it's going to be some impersonation.

594
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,087
It's an old plot trick.

595
00:38:58,087 --> 00:38:59,420
Mr.Franklin!

596
00:39:00,586 --> 00:39:04,020
Yoo-hoo! Over here.

597
00:39:04,887 --> 00:39:05,853
Who's that?

598
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,586
Someone who should be
somewhere else.

599
00:39:11,386 --> 00:39:12,486
Excuse me a moment.

600
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,720
Miss La Sanka!
What a pleasant surprise...

601
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,453
What brings you to the big city?

602
00:39:20,553 --> 00:39:24,186
Oh... I came in to do a little
shopping. You like my dress?

603
00:39:24,286 --> 00:39:25,320
Oh, it's lovely.

604
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,453
See a play.

605
00:39:28,386 --> 00:39:30,619
She's a beauty, Mr.Franklin.

606
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:32,619
Yes, she is. Thank you.

607
00:39:33,019 --> 00:39:34,953
I haven't seen her before, have I?

608
00:39:35,619 --> 00:39:38,919
No, I don't believe you have.
Well, it's lovely to see you.

609
00:39:39,019 --> 00:39:42,485
I, ah...hope you won't think
I'm being forward,

610
00:39:43,019 --> 00:39:46,786
but is there any chance of our
having a drink together?

611
00:39:46,886 --> 00:39:49,285
Oh, I'd love to, really, but...ah...

612
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:51,385
See, the young lady and I are going
to have late supper.

613
00:39:51,485 --> 00:39:53,619
I think you might want to cancel it.

614
00:39:57,452 --> 00:39:59,052
Just why would I want to do that?

615
00:39:59,352 --> 00:40:03,552
Because we really should have
a discussion.

616
00:40:06,552 --> 00:40:07,352
Perhaps some other time.

617
00:40:07,652 --> 00:40:08,585
All right.

618
00:40:08,686 --> 00:40:12,918
I suppose I'll have to find
someone else to tell my story to.

619
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:17,718
It's a mystery story.
Very interesting, really.

620
00:40:18,252 --> 00:40:20,718
It's all about this...witness...

621
00:40:26,052 --> 00:40:27,484
Just wait here. I'll be right back.

622
00:40:27,885 --> 00:40:30,018
Anything you say, Mr.Franklin.

623
00:40:39,018 --> 00:40:43,217
Oh wow, I just can't resist
strawberries.

624
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:44,685
Glad you like them.

625
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:55,351
You're making me nervous.

626
00:40:57,251 --> 00:40:58,785
That's quite a stare.

627
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:00,618
I'm sorry. I can't help it.

628
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:03,351
Do you know I've never seen you
outside that store before?

629
00:41:04,217 --> 00:41:07,251
You're very lovely.
May I call you Lilly?

630
00:41:07,651 --> 00:41:09,151
Yes, please do.

631
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,617
How did you enjoy the play, tonight?

632
00:41:16,084 --> 00:41:18,617
I thought it was predictable. You?

633
00:41:19,151 --> 00:41:21,550
I like your books much more.

634
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:22,717
That's very flattering.

635
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:26,117
But you said something before about
your story.

636
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:27,884
Something about a...witness.

637
00:41:28,617 --> 00:41:31,617
Oh, yes. Well, actually,

638
00:41:32,117 --> 00:41:35,450
it's a true-to-life story.

639
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,750
The best kind.

640
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:39,650
It concerns your partner.

641
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:41,483
Jim?

642
00:41:42,717 --> 00:41:43,583
What about him?

643
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:48,550
Well, I read in the papers about
his death and I felt just terrible.

644
00:41:49,817 --> 00:41:50,517
Thank you.

645
00:41:50,617 --> 00:41:54,617
I felt just terrible because they
said he was killed in his office.

646
00:41:56,116 --> 00:41:56,883
So they did.

647
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:00,317
Well in my story,

648
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:04,250
you see, he couldn't have actually
been killed in an office.

649
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:06,283
Because he was...

650
00:42:07,616 --> 00:42:08,516
...somewhere else.

651
00:42:10,616 --> 00:42:13,083
Just for the moment. Let's forget
about your story.

652
00:42:13,183 --> 00:42:15,449
Let's talk about real life.

653
00:42:18,382 --> 00:42:19,916
It is simpler, isn't it?

654
00:42:20,016 --> 00:42:20,716
Much.

655
00:42:21,316 --> 00:42:22,883
I'll tell you honestly. Ken.

656
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:27,582
I was very confused when I saw
the papers. Because...

657
00:42:28,182 --> 00:42:31,449
...when you were in my store making
a phone call the other day,

658
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,316
I wandered over to the side window
to see...

659
00:42:35,416 --> 00:42:37,915
...if you had brought a lady
with you.

660
00:42:38,749 --> 00:42:40,783
You didn't believe me when I said
that I was alone?

661
00:42:40,882 --> 00:42:42,683
Oh, I believed you.
It's just that...

662
00:42:44,749 --> 00:42:46,949
I'm very interested in you, Ken.

663
00:42:50,482 --> 00:42:55,516
Well, anyway, you can imagine my
surprise when I saw your partner.

664
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,282
There he was, big as life...

665
00:42:58,316 --> 00:43:00,548
sitting there in the front seat
of your car.

666
00:43:01,715 --> 00:43:03,515
And that disturbed you?

667
00:43:03,615 --> 00:43:05,548
Oh, not at the time.

668
00:43:06,882 --> 00:43:07,982
Only later.

669
00:43:08,748 --> 00:43:11,381
And then I debated with myself
for days...

670
00:43:11,481 --> 00:43:13,815
...whether to come and see you
or not.

671
00:43:16,082 --> 00:43:17,214
Why didn't you go to the police?

672
00:43:17,415 --> 00:43:18,782
Oh, Ken...

673
00:43:20,049 --> 00:43:22,181
I wouldn't want to get you into
trouble.

674
00:43:22,515 --> 00:43:23,949
Of course not.

675
00:43:24,448 --> 00:43:26,548
All right, Lilly. How much?

676
00:43:26,782 --> 00:43:30,148
Oh, I hope you don't think that's
the only...

677
00:43:30,248 --> 00:43:31,948
No, no...I don't think anything.

678
00:43:32,081 --> 00:43:33,248
I'll tell you something.

679
00:43:33,715 --> 00:43:36,148
I'm most grateful you came to me
first.

680
00:43:36,581 --> 00:43:40,481
You know why? 'Cause I think we can
reach an equitable agreement.

681
00:43:42,248 --> 00:43:45,048
I do so admire your candor.

682
00:43:46,148 --> 00:43:47,580
This isn't easy for me.

683
00:43:48,348 --> 00:43:52,514
A widow, running a small country
store, trying to make ends meet...

684
00:43:52,614 --> 00:43:56,447
Oh, I can understand that. And I
also recognize in you a woman of...

685
00:43:56,614 --> 00:43:59,447
...some breeding, I mean,
you're not just a common...

686
00:44:00,714 --> 00:44:01,714
...blackmailer.

687
00:44:02,247 --> 00:44:04,547
I'm so glad you're understanding.

688
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,580
Very well, Lilly.

689
00:44:07,814 --> 00:44:09,614
How much for your silence?

690
00:44:14,213 --> 00:44:15,881
Fifteen thousand dollars?

691
00:44:17,514 --> 00:44:19,881
I know it's a lot, but that's all
I'll ever ask for.

692
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,147
Honestly. And I'm a woman
of my word.

693
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,813
I know you are, and I respect you
for that. You know what?

694
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:29,347
In that spirit, I accept your terms.
Agreed?

695
00:44:31,147 --> 00:44:32,280
Agreed.

696
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:36,947
And I know you won't take offense
when I say...

697
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,713
...it's a pleasure doing business
with you.

698
00:44:39,947 --> 00:44:43,047
No, no. My pleasure.

699
00:44:57,313 --> 00:44:58,146
Yes?

700
00:44:58,346 --> 00:44:59,513
Is Mr.Franklin home?

701
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:02,246
He's occupied at the moment.
Who shall I say is calling?

702
00:45:02,346 --> 00:45:03,546
Lieutenant Columbo.

703
00:45:03,646 --> 00:45:06,179
Oh. Well won't you come in
and wait?

704
00:45:07,279 --> 00:45:08,579
He'll be with you shortly.

705
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:16,112
Only a few more.

706
00:45:23,546 --> 00:45:26,446
Thanks muchly, Mr.Franklin, I think
we're about finished.

707
00:45:26,546 --> 00:45:28,645
If you can bear one or two more
photographs.

708
00:45:28,745 --> 00:45:29,712
Fire away.

709
00:45:30,179 --> 00:45:32,246
After all, your magazine was
very kind...

710
00:45:32,346 --> 00:45:34,845
...to Franklin and Ferris
during our lean years.

711
00:45:35,179 --> 00:45:38,378
That's the second reason I granted
the interview.

712
00:45:38,612 --> 00:45:39,979
Oh, what was the first?

713
00:45:40,578 --> 00:45:42,745
Why, the charm of the interviewer,
of course.

714
00:45:50,745 --> 00:45:53,111
Yes, Lieutenant. Is there
something I can do for you?

715
00:45:53,211 --> 00:45:55,745
Oh, yeah...if...if you have a moment.

716
00:45:55,912 --> 00:45:57,312
That's about all I do have.

717
00:45:58,078 --> 00:46:00,045
As soon as I finish here, I'll be
right with you.

718
00:46:00,911 --> 00:46:02,545
Is there anything else? Miss...

719
00:46:03,178 --> 00:46:04,278
May I call you Gloria?

720
00:46:04,578 --> 00:46:05,478
Please do.

721
00:46:06,412 --> 00:46:08,645
Ah...just one last question.

722
00:46:09,445 --> 00:46:10,844
I think our readers will want to
know...

723
00:46:10,945 --> 00:46:13,945
...how the death of your partner will
affect the Mrs.Melville books.

724
00:46:14,512 --> 00:46:17,678
I'm afraid when I buried Jim,
I buried Mrs.Melville with him.

725
00:46:18,445 --> 00:46:19,678
I understand.

726
00:46:20,178 --> 00:46:23,345
But everyone will miss her so.
Can't you write another one?

727
00:46:23,577 --> 00:46:25,711
Oh, I could, naturally, but what's
the point?

728
00:46:26,378 --> 00:46:29,245
With Jim gone, there wouldn't be
much reason.

729
00:46:29,911 --> 00:46:33,477
No, I'm afraid Mrs.Melville has
solved her last case.

730
00:46:34,678 --> 00:46:35,778
Actually, I've been...

731
00:46:36,411 --> 00:46:39,511
...seriously debating as to
whether I'll ever want to write again.

732
00:46:39,744 --> 00:46:41,210
Oh well, I hope you do.

733
00:46:41,544 --> 00:46:43,077
Thank you, that's very kind of you.

734
00:46:43,377 --> 00:46:44,277
Now, if you don't mind...

735
00:46:44,377 --> 00:46:46,177
Of course. Let's go, Harvey.

736
00:46:48,711 --> 00:46:53,844
Perhaps under better circumstances,
less harassed circumstances,

737
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:56,611
I could give you a more detailed
interview.

738
00:46:57,644 --> 00:46:58,944
Even in more depth...

739
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:01,611
That will be nice. Shall I call you?

740
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:04,577
Yes, please do. Next week, huh?

741
00:47:06,344 --> 00:47:07,244
Goodbye.

742
00:47:11,244 --> 00:47:11,910
Oh, sorry Harvey.

743
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:12,643
Thank you.

744
00:47:12,743 --> 00:47:13,677
Thanks very much.

745
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:26,677
All right, Lieutenant, what can I do
for you?

746
00:47:27,276 --> 00:47:29,077
Well, I brought back your books.

747
00:47:30,077 --> 00:47:32,576
That's fine. Just put them over
there on the table.

748
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:36,576
Yeah...ah...sure. I wanted to tell you
how much I enjoyed 'em.

749
00:47:36,677 --> 00:47:38,376
I think they're the most
terrific...

750
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:39,276
Boy, I want to...

751
00:47:39,376 --> 00:47:42,476
And oh listen, I'll come back,
I'll make two trips on this.

752
00:47:42,576 --> 00:47:46,743
But the lady detective. What a
character! What a brain!

753
00:47:46,842 --> 00:47:49,143
And what logic, the way she
figures it out!

754
00:47:49,243 --> 00:47:52,809
Lieutenant, I'd love to sit down and
discuss literature with you,

755
00:47:52,909 --> 00:47:54,310
But I was on my way out.

756
00:47:56,009 --> 00:47:58,043
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
bother you.

757
00:47:58,143 --> 00:47:59,510
You're going some place special?

758
00:47:59,609 --> 00:48:02,709
Yes, as a matter of fact, I'm on my way
down to my cabin for a rest.

759
00:48:02,943 --> 00:48:04,343
Would you like an itinerary?

760
00:48:04,542 --> 00:48:05,943
Hey, I'm sorry.

761
00:48:06,909 --> 00:48:08,343
I'm making a pest of myself.

762
00:48:08,442 --> 00:48:09,043
No...

763
00:48:09,143 --> 00:48:10,375
Yes, yes, I am.

764
00:48:10,475 --> 00:48:13,009
I know it's because
I keep asking these questions.

765
00:48:13,109 --> 00:48:17,109
But I'll tell you. I can't help myself.
It's a habit.

766
00:48:17,609 --> 00:48:18,976
I take it you're not going alone.

767
00:48:20,375 --> 00:48:21,609
Whatever gave you that idea?

768
00:48:21,909 --> 00:48:23,609
I noticed the two bottles of
champagne...

769
00:48:24,976 --> 00:48:28,876
Oh, those. I'm quite capable of
drinking those two bottles,

770
00:48:28,976 --> 00:48:30,575
and a good deal more
without any help.

771
00:48:30,876 --> 00:48:33,108
Now if you'll excuse me, Lieutenant.

772
00:48:34,042 --> 00:48:35,575
Yeah, listen.
Unless you just want to...

773
00:48:35,676 --> 00:48:39,642
...take a second to know how we're
progressing on your partner's list.

774
00:48:41,142 --> 00:48:43,775
Oh? Anything concrete?

775
00:48:43,875 --> 00:48:47,309
No, not a thing. Just like you
predicted.

776
00:48:47,409 --> 00:48:50,108
Everyone said they never even heard
of James Ferris.

777
00:48:50,475 --> 00:48:52,242
That's just as I expected.

778
00:48:52,442 --> 00:48:55,442
Well it was lovely to chat with you,
Lieutenant.

779
00:49:04,175 --> 00:49:04,908
Mr.Franklin...

780
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:05,608
Yeah?

781
00:49:05,708 --> 00:49:06,508
Do you have a minute?

782
00:49:06,841 --> 00:49:07,942
Is it important?

783
00:49:08,042 --> 00:49:08,841
Well, it could be.

784
00:49:08,942 --> 00:49:12,708
You see, I was checking the phone
company records in San Diego.

785
00:49:15,474 --> 00:49:17,308
Why would you want to do that,
Lieutenant?

786
00:49:18,041 --> 00:49:20,574
I have to do that. You know, that's
part of my job.

787
00:49:20,675 --> 00:49:22,241
I gotta tie up all those loose ends.

788
00:49:22,775 --> 00:49:24,641
Anyway, on the day of murder,

789
00:49:24,741 --> 00:49:26,974
there was a record of a call
from the cabin.

790
00:49:27,241 --> 00:49:30,608
It was a call to the Ferris house
in Los Angeles.

791
00:49:31,007 --> 00:49:34,941
I see. And now you're wondering whether
I can explain that. Is that right?

792
00:49:35,107 --> 00:49:36,107
Oh, I'm sure you can.

793
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:37,574
Oh, you're right, I can.

794
00:49:38,007 --> 00:49:40,607
But you see you would have saved both you
and me a great deal of trouble...

795
00:49:40,707 --> 00:49:42,774
...if you had checked with
Joanna Ferris first.

796
00:49:42,874 --> 00:49:44,007
She would have explained to you...

797
00:49:44,107 --> 00:49:45,774
...that I had spoken to her
from my cabin, telling her that...

798
00:49:45,874 --> 00:49:48,507
...Jim and I had patched up our
differences.

799
00:49:48,874 --> 00:49:50,840
What do you mean by differences?

800
00:49:50,941 --> 00:49:55,307
Well, you see, ironing out any difficulties
in a separation is never easy.

801
00:49:55,407 --> 00:49:59,507
I knew Joanna would be concerned.
I wanted to put her mind at ease.

802
00:50:00,007 --> 00:50:01,107
Can you understand that?

803
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:02,840
Oh yes, yeah. That's understandable.

804
00:50:03,874 --> 00:50:04,974
Fine. Is that all?

805
00:50:05,106 --> 00:50:06,240
Yes. That's all.

806
00:50:09,941 --> 00:50:12,607
Listen...uh... Enjoy your trip.

807
00:50:12,707 --> 00:50:13,840
Thanks very much.

808
00:50:22,473 --> 00:50:23,607
And drive carefully.

809
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:27,006
Don't worry, Lieutenant. You can
count on it.

810
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:08,606
And here you are.

811
00:51:10,172 --> 00:51:11,339
Bearing gifts.

812
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:14,272
And more gifts.

813
00:51:14,372 --> 00:51:17,539
Why, Mr.Franklin, how lovely.

814
00:51:18,406 --> 00:51:19,139
Ken.

815
00:51:19,838 --> 00:51:21,439
Yes, of course. Ken.

816
00:51:22,005 --> 00:51:24,972
Now Lilly, let me ask you a simple
question.

817
00:51:25,506 --> 00:51:28,471
Are you up to making a nice quiet
dinner for two tonight?

818
00:51:31,571 --> 00:51:34,605
Here's to prosperity.

819
00:51:38,271 --> 00:51:40,405
And romance.

820
00:51:44,471 --> 00:51:45,805
The daily double.

821
00:51:52,204 --> 00:51:56,171
I must say, Lilly, that was a
magnificent meal.

822
00:51:56,271 --> 00:51:57,838
Where did you learn to cook so
well?

823
00:51:58,738 --> 00:52:04,171
My late husband, may he rest in
peace, was a professional chef.

824
00:52:05,271 --> 00:52:06,638
Wonderful man.

825
00:52:08,038 --> 00:52:09,471
He taught me all I know.

826
00:52:09,938 --> 00:52:11,371
Well, he taught you well.

827
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,338
Thank you, sir.

828
00:52:16,305 --> 00:52:17,071
Refill?

829
00:52:17,171 --> 00:52:18,171
Oh, sorry.

830
00:52:19,171 --> 00:52:21,338
Oh! We're all out.

831
00:52:22,637 --> 00:52:23,871
Let's open another one.

832
00:52:24,338 --> 00:52:25,271
Dare we?

833
00:52:25,537 --> 00:52:26,804
Dare we not?

834
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:33,138
Here we go...happy new year.

835
00:52:34,938 --> 00:52:36,071
Quick, your glass!

836
00:52:42,804 --> 00:52:44,370
Delicious.

837
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:47,237
But I'm afraid I'm getting a little
tipsy.

838
00:52:47,337 --> 00:52:48,737
What's wrong with that?

839
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:53,270
I don't know if I can trust you.

840
00:52:54,037 --> 00:52:56,003
Now is there any reason not to?

841
00:52:57,903 --> 00:53:00,404
Lilly, if I make you uncomfortable,
I can always leave.

842
00:53:00,504 --> 00:53:01,836
No, please...

843
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:04,836
I do enjoy your company.

844
00:53:13,569 --> 00:53:14,870
You know what we should do...?

845
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:15,770
What?

846
00:53:16,403 --> 00:53:17,536
It's such a beautiful night...

847
00:53:17,636 --> 00:53:23,336
we should row out to the center
of the lake and go for swim.

848
00:53:23,436 --> 00:53:26,070
Mmmm...sounds nice.

849
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:28,603
It is nice. Shall we?

850
00:53:29,336 --> 00:53:30,303
Better not.

851
00:53:30,569 --> 00:53:31,536
Why not?

852
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:35,503
I trust you, Ken. Really.

853
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:39,336
But we all have our dark sides,
don't we?

854
00:53:39,902 --> 00:53:41,670
It just wouldn't be very intelligent
of me...

855
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:43,969
...to be alone with you
in a small boat.

856
00:53:44,835 --> 00:53:47,769
After all, you might start having
second thoughts about the money.

857
00:53:50,503 --> 00:53:52,136
I wish you hadn't said that, Lilly.

858
00:53:54,036 --> 00:53:55,936
That kind of talk hurts me deeply.

859
00:53:58,002 --> 00:54:00,136
I'm going to tell you something and
I shouldn't.

860
00:54:02,069 --> 00:54:04,936
But I'll tell you why because I
trust you.

861
00:54:06,635 --> 00:54:10,069
I was prepared to give you
considerably more than you asked for.

862
00:54:11,402 --> 00:54:15,036
Fifteen thousand, I mean I've lost
that much gambling in one night.

863
00:54:18,002 --> 00:54:20,602
Well, it certainly is a great deal
of money to me.

864
00:54:28,368 --> 00:54:31,502
What do you think
you'll do with all of it?

865
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:35,368
I don't know...put it in the bank,
I guess.

866
00:54:36,101 --> 00:54:37,935
But not right away.

867
00:54:38,201 --> 00:54:41,135
I just want to look at it
for a while.

868
00:54:47,801 --> 00:54:52,268
Better be careful.
Someone might rob you.

869
00:54:52,734 --> 00:54:54,968
I'll just keep it for a day or two.

870
00:54:56,235 --> 00:54:59,101
I've never seen so much money
in my life.

871
00:55:02,834 --> 00:55:10,134
Uh maybe...Maybe you could take a
trip somewhere?

872
00:55:11,068 --> 00:55:14,801
I may. I've always wanted to go on
a cruise.

873
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:18,534
Oh cruises. So romantic.

874
00:55:19,601 --> 00:55:23,267
Did I tell you that my late husband
was in the merchant marines?

875
00:55:23,934 --> 00:55:24,900
Is that a fact?

876
00:55:26,367 --> 00:55:28,501
They're the ones who taught him how
to cook.

877
00:55:29,134 --> 00:55:31,234
I almost wish he were here now.

878
00:55:32,367 --> 00:55:34,301
He could share this with me.

879
00:55:35,667 --> 00:55:38,000
Well...maybe we can do the next best
thing.

880
00:57:06,098 --> 00:57:07,299
Who did you say it is?

881
00:57:07,399 --> 00:57:10,098
One of the cops said it was a local
woman. Some kinda drowning.

882
00:57:51,164 --> 00:57:51,964
Morning.

883
00:58:00,797 --> 00:58:02,331
Well, Lieutenant Columbo!

884
00:58:02,464 --> 00:58:04,730
I must say you turn up at the oddest
times, don't you?

885
00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:07,864
Listen, I hope you don't mind my
coming in that way, you know.

886
00:58:07,964 --> 00:58:10,398
But the door was open and I
just let myself in.

887
00:58:10,498 --> 00:58:12,464
No, no, no. How did you get here,
by magic carpet?

888
00:58:12,563 --> 00:58:13,864
I didn't see your car outside.

889
00:58:13,964 --> 00:58:16,463
Oh no, I pulled around back and I
put it in the shade.

890
00:58:16,563 --> 00:58:18,097
The sun raises hell
with the paint.

891
00:58:18,197 --> 00:58:19,331
Oh, sensible.

892
00:58:19,664 --> 00:58:21,830
What brings you up here to the
wilds?

893
00:58:21,997 --> 00:58:22,864
Well, I'll tell you.

894
00:58:22,964 --> 00:58:25,997
I heard you and Mrs.Ferris
talk so much about this place.

895
00:58:26,097 --> 00:58:29,031
And you made it sound so terrific,
and believe me,

896
00:58:29,697 --> 00:58:33,263
you weren't exaggerating,
because this is magnificent.

897
00:58:33,964 --> 00:58:38,363
And since I got a two-week
vacation coming up,

898
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:42,363
I said to myself go on down there,
check out the area,

899
00:58:42,664 --> 00:58:44,930
look to see maybe you can rent a
cabin.

900
00:58:45,664 --> 00:58:48,297
Lieutenant, you're not going to tell
me you drove down here...

901
00:58:48,397 --> 00:58:50,430
...just to look for a vacation spot,
are you?

902
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:52,563
Why else would I come?

903
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:54,763
You're wasting your time.

904
00:58:56,263 --> 00:58:58,597
I have a feeling the cabins in
this neck of the woods...

905
00:58:58,696 --> 00:59:00,363
...are pretty much out of your
price range, anyway.

906
00:59:00,463 --> 00:59:02,729
Most of them are rented
for the season.

907
00:59:03,397 --> 00:59:08,230
Oh, gee, whiz that...That's too bad.

908
00:59:08,629 --> 00:59:11,163
Gosh my wife is going to be
disappointed.

909
00:59:11,263 --> 00:59:13,663
Well, it was a nice ride anyhow.

910
00:59:13,763 --> 00:59:15,030
Yes, a lovely drive.

911
00:59:15,296 --> 00:59:18,663
Except for that bottleneck down the
road. What was that all about?

912
00:59:18,863 --> 00:59:20,396
Oh there was a drowning.

913
00:59:20,863 --> 00:59:22,496
Oh, what was it, a fisherman?

914
00:59:22,696 --> 00:59:25,063
Well, I heard someone say it was a
local woman.

915
00:59:25,296 --> 00:59:27,095
Ah Miss La Sanka, or something?

916
00:59:27,195 --> 00:59:28,729
Something like that, yeah.

917
00:59:29,829 --> 00:59:30,763
Did you know her?

918
00:59:30,863 --> 00:59:31,696
Not really. No.

919
00:59:32,062 --> 00:59:34,763
I was just wondering because
when I was in the kitchen before,

920
00:59:34,863 --> 00:59:36,663
I noticed a grocery box with her
name on it.

921
00:59:36,763 --> 00:59:38,396
I occasionally buy supplies there.

922
00:59:38,496 --> 00:59:40,396
Sure, like anyone else who lives
around here.

923
00:59:41,362 --> 00:59:43,329
I think she was the one that drowned.

924
00:59:43,596 --> 00:59:47,728
Yeah, because I stopped by the
grocery store on the way here...

925
00:59:47,828 --> 00:59:50,429
...to pick up some cigars and
I noticed it was closed and...

926
00:59:51,362 --> 00:59:53,262
cops' cars around.

927
00:59:54,462 --> 00:59:55,962
Well, if it was her,

928
00:59:56,995 --> 00:59:59,162
I'd be very sorry.
She was always very friendly.

929
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:01,162
Yeah, that's a shame.

930
01:00:02,495 --> 01:00:03,428
Oh? You did know her.

931
01:00:04,962 --> 01:00:07,695
Lieutenant, I know a lot of people
without really knowing them.

932
01:00:07,795 --> 01:00:09,062
You know, like...

933
01:00:09,595 --> 01:00:12,295
...barbers, waitresses, parking lot
attendants.

934
01:00:12,929 --> 01:00:16,295
Even the cop on the beat, don't you?

935
01:00:17,161 --> 01:00:20,895
Yeah, I do, as a matter of fact.

936
01:00:21,628 --> 01:00:24,328
I tell you people are strange,
you though know.

937
01:00:24,428 --> 01:00:27,662
I can't figure 'em out.
Why a woman goes out on a lake...

938
01:00:27,762 --> 01:00:29,528
...all by herself
before the light comes up.

939
01:00:29,961 --> 01:00:31,994
Oh, there's nothing unusual about
that.

940
01:00:32,628 --> 01:00:34,228
A lot of us go out early.

941
01:00:34,961 --> 01:00:38,194
It's peaceful and it kind of makes
you feel like you're...

942
01:00:39,661 --> 01:00:41,528
...plugged into nature.
You know what I mean?

943
01:00:41,627 --> 01:00:42,994
Yeah, yeah.

944
01:00:45,361 --> 01:00:47,961
Well, say, listen, look, you came
down here to get away from things,

945
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:50,594
and I'm just taking up your time.
I didn't mean to bother you.

946
01:00:50,994 --> 01:00:53,061
No, no, no. It's no bother at all.

947
01:00:53,394 --> 01:00:55,727
Say I'd be more than glad to let you
have a bathing suit,

948
01:00:55,827 --> 01:00:57,894
but you don't look like
you're the athletic type to me.

949
01:00:57,994 --> 01:01:01,028
Well, it's...uh...my wife that's the
athlete.

950
01:01:02,794 --> 01:01:06,294
So you don't think I'm going to be
able to find a cabin to rent, huh?

951
01:01:06,961 --> 01:01:09,060
Best bet is to go down and check
with some of the local...

952
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:10,060
...real estate people.

953
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:14,127
Because I think it would be fun to be
neighbors for a couple of weeks, huh?

954
01:01:14,227 --> 01:01:14,993
Yeah.

955
01:01:15,093 --> 01:01:16,861
Say, what kind of night life do you
have around here?

956
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,560
Night life? None.

957
01:01:19,527 --> 01:01:20,527
No partying?

958
01:01:20,627 --> 01:01:22,427
Just sleep and crickets.

959
01:01:22,761 --> 01:01:24,427
I was just wondering because,

960
01:01:24,627 --> 01:01:27,560
you know, I didn't want to barge in
on you today unannounced.

961
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:28,893
I don't follow you.

962
01:01:29,093 --> 01:01:32,160
Well, last night I called to
tell you that I was coming...

963
01:01:32,626 --> 01:01:34,060
but there was no one at home.

964
01:02:14,792 --> 01:02:16,059
You a reporter?

965
01:02:16,992 --> 01:02:18,192
No...uh.

966
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:21,459
Lieutenant Columbo.

967
01:02:22,426 --> 01:02:23,393
Police.

968
01:02:24,359 --> 01:02:25,459
L.A.

969
01:02:27,393 --> 01:02:28,492
LAPD?

970
01:02:29,293 --> 01:02:30,825
What brings you down here,
Lieutenant?

971
01:02:31,192 --> 01:02:32,792
Well, I'm working on a case.

972
01:02:32,892 --> 01:02:35,026
Listen, this is not really my
jurisdiction, but...

973
01:02:35,625 --> 01:02:37,192
...you mind if I browse around?

974
01:02:37,293 --> 01:02:40,126
Help yourself, Lieutenant.
Always glad to cooperate.

975
01:02:45,892 --> 01:02:47,425
...didn't she have a bruise on her
head?

976
01:02:47,525 --> 01:02:48,659
How'd you know that, Ben?

977
01:02:48,759 --> 01:02:50,926
Come on, Sergeant, Doc Webster
told us.

978
01:02:51,026 --> 01:02:52,892
All right, so there was a bruise.

979
01:02:53,058 --> 01:02:55,125
Probably a result of the boat
capsizing and...

980
01:02:55,225 --> 01:02:56,125
...rendering her unconscious.

981
01:02:56,325 --> 01:02:58,191
Any indication the lady was under
the influence?

982
01:02:58,292 --> 01:03:00,991
I can't ascertain that until we see
an autopsy report.

983
01:03:01,091 --> 01:03:02,625
The doctor's working on that
right now.

984
01:03:02,725 --> 01:03:03,858
Sounds like drinking to me.

985
01:03:03,958 --> 01:03:04,692
Could she swim?

986
01:03:04,791 --> 01:03:06,891
How in the world would I know a
thing like that?

987
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:08,091
Any living relatives?

988
01:03:08,191 --> 01:03:10,525
I don't think so. Somebody said she
was a widow.

989
01:03:10,658 --> 01:03:11,691
What about the row boat?

990
01:03:11,958 --> 01:03:13,158
Row boat? What about it?

991
01:03:13,425 --> 01:03:15,058
Who did it belong to? Where'd it
come from?

992
01:03:15,325 --> 01:03:17,724
It belonged to the deceased. I've got
witnesses...

993
01:04:18,823 --> 01:04:20,423
Think she wanted some fresh air last
night?

994
01:04:20,757 --> 01:04:22,456
This is all conjecture, gentlemen.

995
01:04:22,556 --> 01:04:25,323
I mean there's no way of telling.
Maybe she did. Who knows?

996
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:29,857
It's also possible that she had a
heart seizure, or she got dizzy.

997
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:31,256
Then you think it was an
accident?

998
01:04:31,356 --> 01:04:33,556
I certainly don't think it was
foul play.

999
01:04:33,857 --> 01:04:35,323
You're going to be in your office
this afternoon?

1000
01:04:35,423 --> 01:04:36,223
Absolutely.

1001
01:04:36,323 --> 01:04:37,590
How long was she in the water,
Sergeant?

1002
01:04:37,690 --> 01:04:39,890
Oh, I don't know. We'll wait till
we get the report.

1003
01:04:39,989 --> 01:04:42,123
We're starting to cover the same
old ground here, gentlemen.

1004
01:04:42,223 --> 01:04:44,089
Now why don't you meet me
in my office an hour from now.

1005
01:04:44,189 --> 01:04:45,723
But we got some more questions.
I'd like to...

1006
01:04:45,822 --> 01:04:47,956
I'll answer 'em all then, I'll have
the reports.

1007
01:04:48,056 --> 01:04:49,956
And I'll be able to give you
a lot more information.

1008
01:04:50,056 --> 01:04:51,089
OK, Sarge. Thank you.

1009
01:04:51,523 --> 01:04:53,789
To my Lilly... Love always, Ken...

1010
01:04:53,889 --> 01:04:55,290
I still don't know what this means.

1011
01:04:55,856 --> 01:04:57,390
It means that he knew her.

1012
01:04:57,856 --> 01:05:00,689
It means that he knew her
not casually, the way he said.

1013
01:05:01,456 --> 01:05:04,123
It means that he knew her
reasonably well.

1014
01:05:04,889 --> 01:05:05,722
All right.

1015
01:05:05,822 --> 01:05:09,389
You've got a romantic inscription
in a book and a champagne cork.

1016
01:05:09,555 --> 01:05:10,956
Now what does that prove?

1017
01:05:11,056 --> 01:05:13,289
By itself, it doesn't prove anything.

1018
01:05:13,856 --> 01:05:17,056
But once you assume that Franklin
committed these crimes,

1019
01:05:17,156 --> 01:05:18,789
everything fits together.

1020
01:05:19,089 --> 01:05:20,589
I just can't believe it.

1021
01:05:20,856 --> 01:05:22,923
I've known Ken too long.
He's not a murderer.

1022
01:05:23,023 --> 01:05:24,956
Mrs.Ferris, it wouldn't make any
difference,

1023
01:05:25,055 --> 01:05:27,955
if you knew him for a hundred years,
that wouldn't change anything.

1024
01:05:28,289 --> 01:05:31,188
This man, Franklin, took your
husband's life.

1025
01:05:36,289 --> 01:05:37,289
Do you have a match?

1026
01:05:41,188 --> 01:05:43,922
Help yourself. I don't smoke.

1027
01:05:50,588 --> 01:05:52,389
It doesn't make sense, Lieutenant.

1028
01:05:52,755 --> 01:05:54,389
Ken has an alibi.

1029
01:05:55,488 --> 01:05:56,655
What's his motive?

1030
01:05:58,155 --> 01:06:00,088
I told you how he coulda worked the
phone.

1031
01:06:01,188 --> 01:06:04,755
Now his motive is the insurance
money. He needed cash.

1032
01:06:05,521 --> 01:06:08,187
He spent money like a drunken sailor,
he had two houses,

1033
01:06:08,588 --> 01:06:09,821
he's got paintings,

1034
01:06:10,588 --> 01:06:12,454
he's got women, he's got...

1035
01:06:14,488 --> 01:06:15,254
What?

1036
01:06:17,955 --> 01:06:19,721
"Jack and Jill went up the hill."

1037
01:06:20,187 --> 01:06:21,655
"Did Jack kill Jill?"

1038
01:06:23,087 --> 01:06:24,788
"If so, find out why."

1039
01:06:28,321 --> 01:06:31,954
Jim. One of his story ideas.

1040
01:06:43,454 --> 01:06:44,121
Lieutenant.

1041
01:06:44,987 --> 01:06:48,687
If Ken killed my husband, then why
did he murder Miss La Sanka?

1042
01:06:49,954 --> 01:06:51,787
Well it's my hunch that she knew
something.

1043
01:06:51,887 --> 01:06:54,553
Maybe she saw them together and
she tried to blackmail him.

1044
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:56,287
That's pure guesswork, isn't it?

1045
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:59,954
No, ma'am, it's not. Not quite.
I checked the bank.

1046
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:02,687
Yesterday he took out fifteen
thousand dollars.

1047
01:07:02,787 --> 01:07:05,353
Today he put it back in again.

1048
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:07,620
Now why in the world
would he do that?

1049
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:13,886
All right. I'm still not convinced,
but...

1050
01:07:14,287 --> 01:07:15,886
...let's say I'll go along.

1051
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:19,353
What happens now?

1052
01:07:19,453 --> 01:07:20,353
I don't know.

1053
01:07:21,487 --> 01:07:24,153
But I've got a pretty strong
circumstantial case,

1054
01:07:24,253 --> 01:07:24,986
it's just not enough.

1055
01:07:25,086 --> 01:07:28,819
If I had one piece of hard evidence,
I could nail this fella.

1056
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:31,453
But you don't.

1057
01:07:31,552 --> 01:07:34,220
That's right, ma'am. I don't.
That's why I'm here.

1058
01:07:34,986 --> 01:07:36,320
Maybe you can give it to me.

1059
01:07:36,819 --> 01:07:37,686
Me?

1060
01:07:38,053 --> 01:07:41,352
You knew both of these fellas very
well. I want you to tell me about them.

1061
01:07:41,452 --> 01:07:43,287
Anything... Just talk.

1062
01:07:43,686 --> 01:07:45,352
Whatever comes into your mind.

1063
01:07:45,753 --> 01:07:48,886
Kind of like analysis without the
couch.

1064
01:07:49,786 --> 01:07:51,586
Would you like a little coffee
first?

1065
01:07:51,953 --> 01:07:53,053
That would be fine.

1066
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,519
I don't know what you're looking
for, but here goes.

1067
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:04,152
They met in a typewriter shop of
all places.

1068
01:08:04,853 --> 01:08:08,119
Jim had broken a key and Ken needed
a ribbon.

1069
01:08:08,452 --> 01:08:09,085
Does that help?

1070
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:10,619
Keep going.

1071
01:08:11,719 --> 01:08:14,386
Well, I've told you a lot about
Jim.

1072
01:08:15,352 --> 01:08:16,885
He was brilliant, really.

1073
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:19,152
He'd wake up in the middle of the
night with ideas.

1074
01:08:19,252 --> 01:08:20,652
Always throwing off sparks.

1075
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:23,518
I remember he even did it
on our honeymoon.

1076
01:08:24,585 --> 01:08:25,952
Funny thing is,

1077
01:08:26,052 --> 01:08:29,785
Ken didn't even talk about the
books, unless he was on television.

1078
01:09:07,151 --> 01:09:09,617
This the truck, that's gonna move
my stuff out of suite 803?

1079
01:09:09,717 --> 01:09:10,318
Yeah.

1080
01:09:10,418 --> 01:09:11,318
Almost finished?

1081
01:09:11,418 --> 01:09:12,451
Haven't started.

1082
01:09:12,651 --> 01:09:13,951
What do you mean you haven't
started?

1083
01:09:14,051 --> 01:09:15,484
I'm only the driver, mister.

1084
01:09:15,584 --> 01:09:18,450
Ask the other two guys. They've been
in there a half an hour already.

1085
01:09:19,184 --> 01:09:20,151
A half hour?

1086
01:09:36,317 --> 01:09:36,984
Columbo!

1087
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:43,450
Hi, Mr.Franklin. Just finishing
up this last Melville mystery.

1088
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:44,917
I didn't get a chance the other day.

1089
01:09:45,017 --> 01:09:46,617
All right, now what are you doing
here?

1090
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:49,183
Waiting for you. I happened to be in
the neighborhood and...

1091
01:09:49,284 --> 01:09:50,950
You're always in the neighborhood.

1092
01:09:51,350 --> 01:09:54,017
You tell me what right you've got to
kick those movers out of this office?

1093
01:09:54,117 --> 01:09:56,584
Oh, listen. I'm sorry about that.
It's just...

1094
01:09:56,683 --> 01:10:00,017
You know what I thought, I thought
you and I should talk alone.

1095
01:10:00,284 --> 01:10:01,716
You and I have nothing to talk about.

1096
01:10:01,816 --> 01:10:04,917
Yes, we do, Mr.Franklin. We have
something to talk about.

1097
01:10:05,583 --> 01:10:07,917
I'm here to arrest you for the
murder of your partner.

1098
01:10:08,783 --> 01:10:09,483
What?

1099
01:10:09,583 --> 01:10:12,250
Now it's my duty to inform you of
your constitutional rights...

1100
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:13,616
Oh will you cut that drivel.

1101
01:10:13,716 --> 01:10:16,117
I've written that stuff so many
times I know it by heart.

1102
01:10:16,217 --> 01:10:19,050
What is this nonsense? Your
going to arrest me?

1103
01:10:19,249 --> 01:10:20,416
Come on, Mr.Franklin.

1104
01:10:20,516 --> 01:10:23,283
Why don't you make a statement
and save us both a lot of trouble?

1105
01:10:23,483 --> 01:10:25,182
You know, I've really got you.

1106
01:10:26,516 --> 01:10:29,082
All right, Lieutenant, you got me.
I'm your prisoner.

1107
01:10:29,182 --> 01:10:31,249
Here, clamp the irons on me.

1108
01:10:32,449 --> 01:10:35,016
Do you wanna give me a dime first, so
I can phone my attorney because...

1109
01:10:35,116 --> 01:10:37,783
I promise you I'm going to sue you
and your department...

1110
01:10:37,882 --> 01:10:39,916
...for false arrest, and
defamation of character.

1111
01:10:40,016 --> 01:10:42,149
I kinda knew it right from the start.

1112
01:10:42,815 --> 01:10:46,049
It was nothing definite, it
was a lotta little things.

1113
01:10:46,483 --> 01:10:50,016
Little things. Driving back from San
Diego,

1114
01:10:50,116 --> 01:10:52,649
on the day of the murder
instead of taking a plane.

1115
01:10:52,815 --> 01:10:54,116
The open mail.

1116
01:10:54,383 --> 01:10:56,216
Never showing any genuine emotion...

1117
01:10:56,316 --> 01:10:58,749
...for a man that you worked with
for ten years.

1118
01:10:58,882 --> 01:11:00,582
With that? You know what they're
going to do?

1119
01:11:00,682 --> 01:11:02,316
They're going to laugh you
right out of court.

1120
01:11:02,415 --> 01:11:04,949
They're not going to laugh at the
insurance policy, are they?

1121
01:11:05,049 --> 01:11:07,815
I've got a photostatic copy of it
here in my pocket.

1122
01:11:08,049 --> 01:11:10,016
They're going to laugh at the fact
that you withdrew...

1123
01:11:10,116 --> 01:11:12,515
...fifteen thousand dollars and
put it back the next day?

1124
01:11:12,615 --> 01:11:16,282
I've got the book that you gave to Miss
La Sanka, with your signature in it.

1125
01:11:16,982 --> 01:11:19,916
You expect to get a true bill
of indictment on that trivia?

1126
01:11:20,649 --> 01:11:24,382
Come on, Lieutenant, I was down in
San Diego.

1127
01:11:25,482 --> 01:11:26,248
So was your partner.

1128
01:11:27,482 --> 01:11:29,215
That's a provocative statement.

1129
01:11:29,548 --> 01:11:30,248
Can you prove that?

1130
01:11:30,582 --> 01:11:35,215
Yes. Not with the witness, because
you killed the witness.

1131
01:11:35,615 --> 01:11:37,015
But I've got another way
to prove it.

1132
01:11:37,915 --> 01:11:39,415
Will you enlighten me? I must say,

1133
01:11:39,515 --> 01:11:42,448
I enjoy watching a man raise
without any cards in his hand.

1134
01:11:42,648 --> 01:11:45,348
You know what, Ken. I'm going to
tell you the truth.

1135
01:11:45,681 --> 01:11:49,282
For a while there I never thought I
was going to get you, believe me.

1136
01:11:49,382 --> 01:11:53,081
You had me going in such circles.
I couldn't figure it out.

1137
01:11:53,514 --> 01:11:55,248
Suddenly, I thought of something.

1138
01:11:55,447 --> 01:11:57,514
How clever that first murder was.

1139
01:11:57,848 --> 01:12:01,514
The phone gimmick, working late in
the office. Brilliant.

1140
01:12:01,614 --> 01:12:03,414
Are you awarding gold medals today?

1141
01:12:03,814 --> 01:12:08,114
Yes. For the first one. Not for the
second one, that was sloppy.

1142
01:12:08,514 --> 01:12:10,915
Mrs.Melville, she would've been
very disappointed.

1143
01:12:11,015 --> 01:12:12,948
Oh, come on, get to the climax,
Lieutenant.

1144
01:12:13,047 --> 01:12:14,347
You're talking to a writer.

1145
01:12:14,447 --> 01:12:16,648
Am I? That's not what I heard.

1146
01:12:16,881 --> 01:12:19,980
And that's the key, that you're not
a writer.

1147
01:12:20,447 --> 01:12:23,947
When Mrs.Ferris told me that you
didn't contribute to the writing,

1148
01:12:24,047 --> 01:12:25,648
that her husband did all the work...

1149
01:12:26,447 --> 01:12:27,281
That's a lie.

1150
01:12:27,381 --> 01:12:29,347
I had to say to myself,

1151
01:12:29,581 --> 01:12:32,147
how could a man with no talent
for mysteries...

1152
01:12:32,247 --> 01:12:33,647
...make up such a clever murder?

1153
01:12:33,747 --> 01:12:36,713
If you were that ingenious, you'd be
able to write your own books.

1154
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:42,147
Go ahead, I'm fascinated, as boring
as it may be.

1155
01:12:42,446 --> 01:12:43,480
Then I got it.

1156
01:12:44,347 --> 01:12:48,546
The first one, the clever one,
that wasn't yours.

1157
01:12:48,647 --> 01:12:52,280
The second one, the sloppy one,
that was yours.

1158
01:12:52,747 --> 01:12:54,080
But not the first.

1159
01:12:56,246 --> 01:12:57,713
And whose idea was that then?

1160
01:12:59,713 --> 01:13:01,813
Your partner's. Hadda be.

1161
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:04,647
And his wife told me how
conscientious he was.

1162
01:13:04,747 --> 01:13:06,513
You know, the way he used to write
down his ideas...

1163
01:13:06,613 --> 01:13:09,480
...on every odd scrap of paper,
backs of matches.

1164
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:12,413
Aah, so that's why you wouldn't let
the movers in.

1165
01:13:13,013 --> 01:13:16,246
Well, I had to rummage around here
before they emptied everything out.

1166
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:19,246
Is this your partner's handwriting?

1167
01:13:20,546 --> 01:13:23,946
Well, I think I can prove it is.
Maybe I ought to read this to you.

1168
01:13:24,946 --> 01:13:28,013
"Idea for a Melville book. Perfect
alibi."

1169
01:13:28,413 --> 01:13:30,246
"A wants to kill B."

1170
01:13:30,512 --> 01:13:34,380
"Drives B to a remote house and has
him call his wife in city..."

1171
01:13:34,712 --> 01:13:36,913
"tells her he's working late at the
office."

1172
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:38,879
"Bang, bang."

1173
01:13:41,046 --> 01:13:44,279
Sound familiar? That's the part you
used,

1174
01:13:44,913 --> 01:13:46,812
practically word for word.

1175
01:13:47,479 --> 01:13:48,712
Should I read some more?

1176
01:13:49,746 --> 01:13:50,579
No...

1177
01:13:52,946 --> 01:13:53,646
Officer.

1178
01:13:54,178 --> 01:13:56,579
With this I think I got a
conviction. Don't you?

1179
01:14:01,712 --> 01:14:04,512
You gotta admit I had you going for
a while though, didn't I?

1180
01:14:04,779 --> 01:14:05,778
Yes you did.

1181
01:14:08,679 --> 01:14:10,745
You want to know the irony of all
this?

1182
01:14:12,012 --> 01:14:13,745
That is my idea.

1183
01:14:14,778 --> 01:14:16,811
The only really good one I ever had.

1184
01:14:17,445 --> 01:14:20,078
I must've told it to Jim over
five years ago.

1185
01:14:23,345 --> 01:14:26,145
Who ever thought that idiot would
write it down...?
