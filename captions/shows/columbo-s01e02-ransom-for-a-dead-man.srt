1
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:54,780
<i>Les, I'll tape a memo for you on the
Bronson matter tomorrow.</i>

2
00:00:55,482 --> 00:00:59,315
<i>As far as the Delfor Incorporation suit
is concerned... they've got me.</i>

3
00:00:59,921 --> 00:01:01,615
<i>As far as I can see
they're holding firm,</i>

4
00:01:01,773 --> 00:01:04,265
<i>They want 300,000 dollars, and
they want delivery tomorrow night...</i>

5
00:01:11,323 --> 00:01:12,281
<i>They've got me.</i>

6
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:02,740
Leslie, I thought...

7
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,746
Hello, Pat. Leslie.

8
00:06:06,864 --> 00:06:09,227
Listen. About our tennis date...

9
00:06:11,111 --> 00:06:12,996
I know. I've been very forgetful
lately.

10
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:17,722
Please call me at the office
tomorrow at 12:15 sharp.

11
00:06:18,425 --> 00:06:22,321
Just say "tennis" and I'll remember
to put it on my office calendar.

12
00:06:24,014 --> 00:06:25,291
All right Pat. Goodbye.

13
00:06:46,592 --> 00:06:48,860
When did you sustain
these injuries, Mr. Crowell?

14
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,725
This September 16, Friday,
8:30 in the evening.

15
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:55,791
You were admitted to a hospital
for emergency care on that night?

16
00:06:55,886 --> 00:06:58,952
Yes, I was. St. John's Hospital,
Santa Monica.

17
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:02,433
Your Honor, I would like to introduce
these hospital records as Exhibit A.

18
00:07:02,753 --> 00:07:06,138
Mr. Crowell, what was the extent
of your injuries due to your fall?

19
00:07:06,585 --> 00:07:08,182
My back was hurt real bad.

20
00:07:08,277 --> 00:07:09,140
Objection, Your Honor.

21
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:12,301
The plaintiff is not competent
to give expert medical testimony.

22
00:07:12,653 --> 00:07:13,612
Sustained.

23
00:07:16,326 --> 00:07:18,370
I would like to introduce Exhibit B.

24
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:20,957
A full doctor's report on the
plaintiff's condition,

25
00:07:21,372 --> 00:07:23,927
showing damage to the lumbar region
of the spine...

26
00:07:24,022 --> 00:07:25,779
...with concomitant nerve
damage...

27
00:07:25,874 --> 00:07:28,877
...resulting in partial paralysis
to the left side of his body.

28
00:07:29,451 --> 00:07:30,697
Did you find out anything?

29
00:07:30,793 --> 00:07:33,061
No one's seen or heard from him
since he left Phoenix.

30
00:07:33,443 --> 00:07:34,626
Did you check the hospitals?

31
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:36,606
I've had Nancy calling all morning.
Not a thing.

32
00:07:36,702 --> 00:07:37,723
What about the police?

33
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:39,192
Zero. Shall we...

34
00:07:39,288 --> 00:07:40,693
Let me think about it for a while.

35
00:07:40,853 --> 00:07:43,057
Objection. Irrelevant and immaterial.

36
00:07:43,184 --> 00:07:45,580
Sustained. The answer may go out.

37
00:07:45,963 --> 00:07:47,751
Shall we put out
a missing person's report?

38
00:07:47,847 --> 00:07:49,635
I'll do it myself, after lunch.

39
00:07:50,211 --> 00:07:51,392
How goes it here?

40
00:07:51,487 --> 00:07:54,394
We have a nice middle class jury. Their
dislike of the insurance companies...

41
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,587
...is second only to their distaste
for working class people.

42
00:08:01,068 --> 00:08:05,061
Mr. Crowell, you are a punch press
operator, is that correct?

43
00:08:05,859 --> 00:08:07,424
Have you ever been on welfare before?

44
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,255
Objection.

45
00:08:09,244 --> 00:08:10,267
Sustained.

46
00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:14,642
That night that you fell down the stairs
in the defendant's apartment house,

47
00:08:15,153 --> 00:08:17,197
where had you been prior to your
accident?

48
00:08:17,325 --> 00:08:18,921
At a cafe across the street.

49
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:21,955
In point of fact, Mr. Crowell,
according to the bartender there,

50
00:08:22,051 --> 00:08:25,469
you had at least three drinks,
and no dinner,

51
00:08:25,565 --> 00:08:28,023
before you left the cafe,
and returned to your apartment.

52
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,856
And not being able to see the stairwell
steps properly, you fell.

53
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:33,357
Objection, Your Honor.

54
00:08:33,452 --> 00:08:36,327
Councel is testifying and assuming
facts not in evidence.

55
00:08:36,678 --> 00:08:39,425
The plaintiff alleges the stairs
were improperly lit.

56
00:08:39,616 --> 00:08:41,117
Although the plaintiff may well
have been.

57
00:08:41,213 --> 00:08:42,459
Objection.

58
00:08:42,873 --> 00:08:43,864
Sustained.

59
00:08:50,411 --> 00:08:52,647
Court will be recessed until
one o'clock.

60
00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:59,385
I've convinced my client to discuss
a possible settlement.

61
00:08:59,481 --> 00:09:00,822
I'm sure you have.

62
00:09:00,918 --> 00:09:02,164
My office, in 10 minutes?

63
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:03,473
Mine at 12:30.

64
00:09:05,198 --> 00:09:07,401
It looks good. Very good.

65
00:09:07,593 --> 00:09:10,435
I'll get your insurance company off
the hook cheaply this time.

66
00:09:11,712 --> 00:09:14,363
I've been all over that building of yours
and you'd better start maintaining...

67
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:17,365
in minimum safety standards or the next
time somebody may get killed.

68
00:09:30,427 --> 00:09:32,152
Hi, Mrs.Williams, Michael.

69
00:09:32,247 --> 00:09:33,397
Have you heard anything?

70
00:09:33,494 --> 00:09:36,623
There's still no word from
Mr. Williams. I've tried everywhere.

71
00:09:38,347 --> 00:09:40,040
Thank you Nancy. Bring in your pad.

72
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:45,374
We'd better outline a settlement,
he'll be here soon.

73
00:09:49,462 --> 00:09:51,091
What time do you have Michael?

74
00:09:51,314 --> 00:09:52,400
12:15.

75
00:09:54,891 --> 00:09:57,222
At last they're asking $150,000.

76
00:09:57,637 --> 00:10:00,416
My guess is that he'll say that his
client is ill and needs cash,

77
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,172
and offer to settle for half.

78
00:10:02,428 --> 00:10:04,983
And we'll tell him that his client is
losing and he'll take what he can get...

79
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:07,474
...which is nuisance value
at $10,000.

80
00:10:07,665 --> 00:10:08,911
That's hitting him pretty hard.

81
00:10:12,423 --> 00:10:15,139
Les? One word, tennis.

82
00:10:16,544 --> 00:10:17,662
Don't forget.

83
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:21,239
What? Who is this?

84
00:10:21,877 --> 00:10:22,644
Hello?

85
00:10:29,031 --> 00:10:29,702
What is it?

86
00:10:30,883 --> 00:10:32,256
You'd better call the police.

87
00:10:33,694 --> 00:10:36,089
That man on the phone said he's
got my husband.

88
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:43,242
I want men posted here and here.
But keep them out sight.

89
00:10:43,338 --> 00:10:45,829
I don't want a lot of worried neighbors
calling the police every 5 minutes.

90
00:10:45,925 --> 00:10:46,883
Mr. Carlson.

91
00:10:48,704 --> 00:10:51,642
Hoffman, this is Carlson.
We don't want any press leaks on this.

92
00:10:51,993 --> 00:10:54,261
Now listen, I don't want to have to
add up all the favors you owe me.

93
00:10:54,357 --> 00:10:55,922
And I'm sure you don't want me
to either.

94
00:10:58,253 --> 00:11:00,552
We'll stay out of the papers for
the time being Mrs. Williams.

95
00:11:00,648 --> 00:11:01,286
Thank you.

96
00:11:01,606 --> 00:11:02,884
Is that tap in ready?

97
00:11:02,979 --> 00:11:04,161
Not quite yet, sir.

98
00:11:04,544 --> 00:11:07,419
We'll be able to monitor any phone calls
that come in through this Mrs. Williams.

99
00:11:08,951 --> 00:11:10,580
Will you be able to trace the calls?

100
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:12,880
Maybe. Unfortunately the kidnapper
is...

101
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:15,626
...usually smart enough to keep the
calls short so we won't have the time.

102
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,149
But with this tape we can make
voice prints at the lab.

103
00:11:18,341 --> 00:11:20,800
That sometimes gives us a lead
on making identifications.

104
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:22,237
There's something I have to ask you,

105
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,313
I want you to be completely honest
with me.

106
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:25,335
Of course.

107
00:11:25,846 --> 00:11:27,570
After I pay the ransom,

108
00:11:28,113 --> 00:11:29,998
what are the chances of my getting
my husband back?

109
00:11:30,349 --> 00:11:32,265
All right, I'll be honest with you
Mrs. Williams.

110
00:11:32,585 --> 00:11:35,108
There's no way of knowing.
All we can do is hope for the best.

111
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:37,056
We'll do everything we possibly
can.

112
00:11:37,151 --> 00:11:38,716
Oh, of course you will. I know that.

113
00:11:38,812 --> 00:11:42,037
Look Mrs.Williams. Let's try to take
an optimistic point of view on this?

114
00:11:42,261 --> 00:11:43,347
He's probably just fine.

115
00:11:43,443 --> 00:11:45,296
You'll have him with you in
another 24 hours.

116
00:11:46,669 --> 00:11:47,659
That's all I want.

117
00:11:48,872 --> 00:11:49,575
Excuse me.

118
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:56,217
Carlson.

119
00:11:56,984 --> 00:11:58,038
Yes, I'll hold.

120
00:12:08,034 --> 00:12:09,088
Mrs.Williams?

121
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:11,931
Lieutenant Columbo. Local police.

122
00:12:12,027 --> 00:12:15,252
I seem to have dropped my pen out
here somewhere.

123
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:16,402
Just a minute.

124
00:12:20,554 --> 00:12:21,671
Would you like some help?

125
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:23,683
Oh, no, that won't be necessary,
thank you very much.

126
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:25,918
I'll just take another quick
look...

127
00:12:26,494 --> 00:12:27,899
I can get a flashlight.

128
00:12:27,995 --> 00:12:30,900
Oh really, don't bother. It's all
right. I've got some matches.

129
00:12:31,093 --> 00:12:32,210
It's no trouble.

130
00:12:32,305 --> 00:12:34,414
Oh really, it's not that important,
it's just a pen.

131
00:12:34,861 --> 00:12:36,905
You see, it was engraved,
that was the only reason.

132
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,428
But I'll buy another one
and I'll have that one engraved.

133
00:12:39,523 --> 00:12:41,504
You see the pen itself was
worthless...

134
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:42,845
Is that it?

135
00:12:42,973 --> 00:12:43,644
Where?

136
00:12:43,835 --> 00:12:44,602
There.

137
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,328
Is everything all right
Mrs.Williams?

138
00:12:49,424 --> 00:12:51,149
Lieutenant Columbo's lost his pen.

139
00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:52,873
Oh listen, don't bother him
about it.

140
00:12:53,543 --> 00:12:54,566
Lieutenant Columbo?

141
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:56,482
Oh yes. How do you do?
How are you?

142
00:12:56,993 --> 00:13:00,410
Uh, Mrs. Williams, I think that
we can forget about the pen now.

143
00:13:00,506 --> 00:13:01,879
Would you like me to get you
a flashlight?

144
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:03,413
No really, it's not that important.

145
00:13:03,508 --> 00:13:05,616
That last call was from the police.
They found your husband's car.

146
00:13:11,684 --> 00:13:12,929
Was there any sign of violence?

147
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:13,887
None whatsoever.

148
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:22,830
How do you suppose they
stopped it?

149
00:13:22,926 --> 00:13:24,618
The car was found near a stop sign.

150
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:27,684
So we assume that when your husband
pulled up to the intersection,

151
00:13:27,972 --> 00:13:29,217
the kidnappers found the
opportunity...

152
00:13:29,313 --> 00:13:31,867
Uh, Mr.Carlson, there's a
gentleman here to see you.

153
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:33,305
Oh, Lieutenant.

154
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,626
Yes, gentlemen this is Lieutenant
Columbo, our local police liaison.

155
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:37,840
How do you do?

156
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:40,714
As I was saying, the stop sign
suggests that you...

157
00:13:43,141 --> 00:13:44,547
Is there something we can do
for you Lieutenant?

158
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:47,581
Uh, well I dropped by to tell you
that they found the car.

159
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,146
We already have that information.

160
00:13:49,273 --> 00:13:50,359
I can see that.

161
00:13:51,062 --> 00:13:52,211
How's the tap in coming?

162
00:13:52,307 --> 00:13:53,521
Not yet.

163
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,491
Feel perfectly free to stay
if you like Lieutenant.

164
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:57,800
Oh, thank you very much.

165
00:13:59,301 --> 00:14:00,770
Jerry, I'd like you to get a man...

166
00:14:00,994 --> 00:14:03,261
Check out the houses in the area
where the car was found.

167
00:14:03,357 --> 00:14:05,496
Somebody may have seen something
or heard something last night.

168
00:14:06,072 --> 00:14:07,892
Start from Sunset and work your
way up.

169
00:14:07,988 --> 00:14:10,000
Oh, and Hammond, be sure to get
the lab report...

170
00:14:10,095 --> 00:14:11,852
...on the briefcase and the
luggage found in the car.

171
00:14:11,948 --> 00:14:14,056
Mr. Carlson, do you suppose that
the kidnappers...

172
00:14:14,152 --> 00:14:15,621
...followed him all the way
from Phoenix?

173
00:14:15,717 --> 00:14:17,153
Well, I doubt that Mrs.Williams.

174
00:14:17,729 --> 00:14:19,485
But they must have known when he
left Phoenix.

175
00:14:19,836 --> 00:14:22,391
That's what makes us think that
they may have had someone there...

176
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:24,371
...checking out the time of
departure.

177
00:14:24,722 --> 00:14:25,713
You see if that's true,

178
00:14:25,809 --> 00:14:28,044
they could notify their
confederates here and they could...

179
00:14:28,332 --> 00:14:30,439
The Lieutenant would like to see
the ransom note.

180
00:14:30,535 --> 00:14:31,557
Mmm? Oh, oh certainly.

181
00:14:32,196 --> 00:14:34,591
Do you know exactly what time
your husband would've left Phoenix?

182
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,880
Excuse me.
May I see the envelope please.

183
00:14:39,062 --> 00:14:42,319
No, no, I didn't.
Neither did anyone in my office.

184
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,811
Hammond, which police garage would
they have taken the car to?

185
00:14:44,907 --> 00:14:45,769
Downtown.

186
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:47,717
I'll arrange for our people to run
a set of fingerprints.

187
00:14:48,036 --> 00:14:50,048
You know, strange thing
Mrs.Williams.

188
00:14:50,176 --> 00:14:52,029
When you look at the route
your husband must have taken...

189
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,552
What is that? An aerial map?

190
00:14:55,637 --> 00:14:56,819
Oh, I see.

191
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,629
What's it for?

192
00:15:00,587 --> 00:15:02,504
It came with the instructions from
the kidnappers.

193
00:15:03,175 --> 00:15:04,356
Oh, they sent instructions?

194
00:15:04,995 --> 00:15:05,698
What were they?

195
00:15:05,793 --> 00:15:08,923
Well, Mrs. Williams is to fly alone
north along this highway.

196
00:15:09,466 --> 00:15:10,647
When she reaches this point on
the map,

197
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,532
she takes a heading out across
the desert.

198
00:15:12,947 --> 00:15:14,895
Now, there'll be a flashing light
signal right about there,

199
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,460
and the money is to be dropped in
a bag.

200
00:15:16,555 --> 00:15:17,705
The usual warnings. No cops.

201
00:15:20,739 --> 00:15:21,730
When is the drop?

202
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,818
That we don't know. Like it says,
they'll call us tonight.

203
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,704
Now listen Miller, the victim's car
has been picked up by the LAPD.

204
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:34,248
They've got it in the downtown garage.

205
00:15:36,804 --> 00:15:39,358
What I want you do to is run a
fingerprint check on it for us, will you?

206
00:15:39,454 --> 00:15:40,572
You fly a plane?

207
00:15:41,594 --> 00:15:42,457
By yourself?

208
00:15:43,766 --> 00:15:44,691
No kidding.

209
00:15:44,787 --> 00:15:45,714
No kidding.

210
00:15:47,087 --> 00:15:48,908
Yeah, they'll probably give you
a little static but...

211
00:15:51,143 --> 00:15:53,666
We're going on the basis that
the victim crossed the state line...

212
00:15:53,761 --> 00:15:56,221
Excuse me. How's it going?

213
00:15:56,604 --> 00:15:58,489
Fine, fine. Be through in a few
minutes.

214
00:16:00,117 --> 00:16:02,704
We'll have to wait till he gets off
the phone before we can check it out.

215
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:03,918
Fascinating.

216
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:07,463
Right. Well you let me know
if you have any problems. Right.

217
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,299
Can I help you Lieutenant?

218
00:16:35,822 --> 00:16:36,972
No. Just browsing.

219
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,633
For anything in particular?

220
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:43,135
Because if there's anything you'd
like, I'd be only too happy to help.

221
00:16:43,615 --> 00:16:45,371
Oh. Thank you very much.

222
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:48,788
Mrs.Williams?

223
00:16:49,715 --> 00:16:51,503
Uh... men's room?

224
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:54,377
Oh the powder room is up those
steps,

225
00:16:54,473 --> 00:16:56,996
down the hall and first door
on your right.

226
00:16:59,743 --> 00:17:00,861
Have you got that?

227
00:17:02,808 --> 00:17:04,246
First door on your right.

228
00:17:10,377 --> 00:17:11,942
It'll be ready in a minute
Mr.Carlson.

229
00:17:13,827 --> 00:17:15,392
One, two, three, four...

230
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:20,661
House is cold.

231
00:17:23,822 --> 00:17:27,145
I must say Mrs. Williams, you're
bearing up through this very well indeed.

232
00:17:28,997 --> 00:17:31,009
It may seem like it,
but if it weren't for you.

233
00:17:31,232 --> 00:17:32,893
Well, that's very kind of you
Mrs.Williams.

234
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,064
But we just do what we can,
that's all.

235
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:36,757
You're very modest.

236
00:17:38,002 --> 00:17:42,282
Tell me, do you think you'll find
any trace of fingerprints in the car?

237
00:17:43,591 --> 00:17:48,765
Frankly, I doubt it. It's a very
professional, well planned operation.

238
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,895
See they knew what time your husband
was coming from out of town,

239
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,907
They know about you flying a plane.

240
00:17:54,929 --> 00:17:58,506
Now, I think the only fingerprints
we'll find will be your husband's.

241
00:17:59,336 --> 00:18:01,221
And yours of course.

242
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,175
Did you find it Lieutenant?

243
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:14,698
Oh yes, very well ma'am.
Thank you.

244
00:18:15,113 --> 00:18:17,189
Listen I have to tell you
Mrs. Williams that...

245
00:18:17,284 --> 00:18:19,073
you've got some beautiful place
here.

246
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:20,574
You just make yourself at home.

247
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:23,417
Say you know the soap you have
in the bathroom?

248
00:18:23,672 --> 00:18:25,205
The ones shaped like little
lemons?

249
00:18:25,812 --> 00:18:27,664
Well I was almost afraid to use
them.

250
00:18:28,175 --> 00:18:30,570
But that's what they're there for
Lieutenant, to be used.

251
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,103
Well if you don't mind my asking...

252
00:18:32,198 --> 00:18:34,881
when you use one and you put it
back in the plate,

253
00:18:34,977 --> 00:18:36,702
how do you keep it from sticking
to the others?

254
00:18:38,427 --> 00:18:39,512
It's a problem.

255
00:18:39,736 --> 00:18:40,950
That's what I figured.

256
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:43,951
Do you know what I think?

257
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:46,507
I think, since we're all going
to be waiting here,

258
00:18:46,602 --> 00:18:48,199
that I'm going to fix us all dinner.

259
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:51,042
Oh, that won't be necessary Mrs.Williams.
We can have something sent in.

260
00:18:51,137 --> 00:18:54,043
Oh please, let me do it,
it will keep me busy.

261
00:18:54,235 --> 00:18:55,512
All right, thank you.

262
00:18:58,067 --> 00:18:58,994
Mrs.Williams?

263
00:19:01,261 --> 00:19:02,954
Don't you have any live in
servants?

264
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:06,371
Oh, must be the same problem
everywhere.

265
00:19:06,594 --> 00:19:08,639
If you want something done,
you gotta do it yourself.

266
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,012
How is that, Lieutenant?

267
00:19:10,459 --> 00:19:13,014
Oh, I was just saying, you pay
a lot of money for help...

268
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,898
...and you end up doing the
cooking.

269
00:19:14,962 --> 00:19:18,443
Well you see, my housekeeper's been
on vacation for the last week, so...

270
00:19:18,538 --> 00:19:22,308
Oh I see. So you've been here alone.

271
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:26,619
Well listen, if there's anything
I can do to help peel potatoes,

272
00:19:26,714 --> 00:19:28,312
whatever, you just feel free.

273
00:19:28,503 --> 00:19:30,419
Oh you'll be the first to know.

274
00:20:06,507 --> 00:20:07,306
<i>Les?</i>

275
00:20:07,817 --> 00:20:08,871
Mrs.Williams?

276
00:20:13,661 --> 00:20:14,396
Paul?

277
00:20:14,492 --> 00:20:16,568
<i>They've got me. They want
300,000 dollars.</i>

278
00:20:16,728 --> 00:20:17,270
When?

279
00:20:17,366 --> 00:20:18,931
<i>Tomorrow night.
Just follow instructions.</i>

280
00:20:19,474 --> 00:20:21,741
Paul! Paul!

281
00:20:22,028 --> 00:20:23,498
Play it back. Make sure we
got all of it.

282
00:20:25,127 --> 00:20:26,180
That's this way.

283
00:20:26,436 --> 00:20:28,128
From this point on the highway to
here...

284
00:20:28,288 --> 00:20:30,173
...over a 150 miles of desert.

285
00:20:30,588 --> 00:20:31,738
No way we can cover all of it.

286
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:34,932
<i>- Les.
- Paul?</i>

287
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:37,742
<i>They've got me. They want 300,000
dollars.</i>

288
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:39,371
<i>Tomorrow night.
Just follow instructions.</i>

289
00:20:39,466 --> 00:20:41,957
I'm not going to take any chances
with my husband's life.

290
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:43,458
There's nothing to worry about
Mrs.Williams.

291
00:20:43,554 --> 00:20:45,438
We'll arrange to have you followed
by helicopter.

292
00:20:45,758 --> 00:20:46,876
Give you plenty of room.

293
00:20:48,057 --> 00:20:52,209
I know you will. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to sound like that.

294
00:20:52,496 --> 00:20:54,859
It's quite all right Mrs.Williams,
we understand how you feel.

295
00:20:57,286 --> 00:21:00,896
I think I'll go upstairs.
I'll be in my room if you want me.

296
00:21:00,992 --> 00:21:01,821
That's a good idea.

297
00:21:01,917 --> 00:21:03,897
We'll be covering the place all
night so you rest easy.

298
00:21:08,177 --> 00:21:09,710
All right, that's it for tonight
fellas.

299
00:21:10,444 --> 00:21:12,105
Let's wrap it up and go home.

300
00:21:12,489 --> 00:21:13,958
I'll get this tape to the lab
right away.

301
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,227
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

302
00:21:25,263 --> 00:21:26,540
Check with you in the morning.

303
00:21:29,032 --> 00:21:30,980
Well Lieutenant, I guess that's
it for tonight.

304
00:21:33,311 --> 00:21:34,205
Lieutenant?

305
00:21:36,601 --> 00:21:37,974
Let's call it a night huh?

306
00:21:38,102 --> 00:21:40,401
Oh I'm sorry.

307
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,479
Thinking there. Unique woman.

308
00:21:46,118 --> 00:21:46,725
What's that?

309
00:21:47,012 --> 00:21:49,599
I say she's an exceptional woman.

310
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,260
What do you mean?

311
00:21:52,696 --> 00:21:54,677
Well when the phone rang
she ran to the phone,

312
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,465
she picked up the receiver and...

313
00:21:58,413 --> 00:22:01,288
She never asked her husband
if he was all right.

314
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:03,140
I don't see anything strange
about that.

315
00:22:03,235 --> 00:22:05,344
The woman was frightened
under stress.

316
00:22:06,781 --> 00:22:09,528
That's right. She was.
She was under stress.

317
00:22:10,357 --> 00:22:12,465
See I just can't help thinking
that...

318
00:22:13,009 --> 00:22:14,669
If I was in the hands of
kidnappers and...

319
00:22:14,765 --> 00:22:19,267
...my wife didn't ask me if I was
okay, I'd think about that.

320
00:22:20,354 --> 00:22:21,631
What's your point, Lieutenant?

321
00:22:21,855 --> 00:22:23,324
Point? No point.

322
00:22:23,419 --> 00:22:27,380
Just that she's a unique person.

323
00:22:28,401 --> 00:22:29,455
Good night, Lieutenant.

324
00:22:48,362 --> 00:22:51,588
Now if you'll just initial here
and sign here.

325
00:22:51,811 --> 00:22:55,196
On all three copies.
300,000 dollars. All yours.

326
00:22:55,931 --> 00:22:57,208
We got all the serial numbers?

327
00:22:57,304 --> 00:23:00,019
Yes, sir. The bank was very cooperative
in helping us mark the money.

328
00:23:00,243 --> 00:23:02,127
We certainly appreciate your help.

329
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:03,372
You're welcome.

330
00:23:03,755 --> 00:23:07,236
Apart from your savings, trust accounts
and municipal bonds,

331
00:23:07,716 --> 00:23:10,079
we naturally were forced to sell
all of your stocks...

332
00:23:10,398 --> 00:23:11,804
...at a considerable loss.

333
00:23:12,538 --> 00:23:14,454
I'm sorry, but there was no other
alternative.

334
00:23:14,646 --> 00:23:17,648
I know that, Mr.Perkins, but this is
no time to worry about money.

335
00:23:17,871 --> 00:23:19,213
Of course, Mrs.Williams.

336
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:20,522
I brought a bag, Mrs.Williams.

337
00:23:20,841 --> 00:23:23,333
Oh thank you. That won't be
necessary. I have a bag.

338
00:23:23,844 --> 00:23:24,866
This should do it.

339
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,133
If you don't need me any longer,
gentlemen.

340
00:23:27,229 --> 00:23:28,219
Thanks again.

341
00:23:41,952 --> 00:23:43,101
Mrs.Williams?

342
00:23:43,197 --> 00:23:45,976
We've got a priority clearance on
that air corridor marked on the map.

343
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:47,029
You'll be all by yourself.

344
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,083
What about you?

345
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:50,351
We'll be holding a position
about 2 miles behind you.

346
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,938
You promise to keep your people
clear of the area.

347
00:23:53,193 --> 00:23:55,301
The Highway Patrol Units all have
their instructions.

348
00:23:55,588 --> 00:23:57,344
If they spot a car picking up the
money,

349
00:23:57,441 --> 00:23:59,867
they just make an identification
and then let it pass.

350
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,391
Chances are they'll get the money
and clear out...

351
00:24:02,487 --> 00:24:03,924
...before anyone gets a chance
to get near them.

352
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,361
So I wouldn't worry too much
about that Mrs.Williams.

353
00:24:05,457 --> 00:24:07,245
I'm concerned about my husband's
life.

354
00:24:07,373 --> 00:24:08,331
Of course.

355
00:24:08,459 --> 00:24:10,311
If you gentlemen will excuse me,
I'll change.

356
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:26,918
All set, Mrs.Williams?

357
00:24:27,238 --> 00:24:28,163
I'm ready.

358
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:29,281
All right. Let's go.

359
00:24:40,427 --> 00:24:41,896
You ride in the rear.

360
00:24:42,535 --> 00:24:43,813
Certainly, certainly.

361
00:25:05,913 --> 00:25:07,286
When you want to talk,
press this button.

362
00:25:07,382 --> 00:25:08,915
When you want to listen,
just release it.

363
00:25:10,001 --> 00:25:11,597
835 Romeo, take off.

364
00:25:12,332 --> 00:25:14,152
You're clear 835 Romeo.

365
00:25:53,945 --> 00:25:54,807
What was that?

366
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:56,245
What was what?

367
00:25:57,075 --> 00:25:58,448
I think there's something wrong
with the motor.

368
00:25:59,023 --> 00:26:01,450
Take it easy Lieutenant.
Everything's just fine.

369
00:26:19,462 --> 00:26:20,963
This is 835 Romeo.

370
00:26:22,721 --> 00:26:24,253
We read you 835 Romeo.

371
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,191
I'm approaching north bound
freeway and descending...

372
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:30,513
<i>... to 1000 feet. Air speed 150.</i>

373
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,302
We're holding a position
on your heading.

374
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,866
Air speed 150.

375
00:26:49,355 --> 00:26:50,601
How much further is it?

376
00:26:52,517 --> 00:26:53,571
<i>How much further is it?</i>

377
00:26:56,668 --> 00:26:57,819
How much further is it?

378
00:26:57,915 --> 00:27:00,278
She'll notify us as she approaches
the Palmdale turnoff.

379
00:27:00,373 --> 00:27:01,140
<i>Is that near?</i>

380
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,695
Do you see that highway down there
to your right?

381
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,156
Yes I do.

382
00:27:09,316 --> 00:27:11,647
She'll be heading off across the
desert from the next coordinates.

383
00:27:26,976 --> 00:27:28,541
This is 835 Romeo.

384
00:27:28,988 --> 00:27:32,118
Approaching coordinates. Begin
new heading 20 degrees northwest.

385
00:27:32,502 --> 00:27:33,300
We read you.

386
00:27:33,683 --> 00:27:35,280
Air speed at 150.

387
00:27:35,663 --> 00:27:37,962
<i>This is 33 Foxtrot to all ground
units.</i>

388
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:40,167
We're approaching the Palmdale turnoff.

389
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,510
Maintain radio silence until visual
contact is established.

390
00:27:44,733 --> 00:27:45,404
Right.

391
00:28:19,736 --> 00:28:21,173
This is 835 Romeo.

392
00:28:21,428 --> 00:28:24,622
<i>835 Romeo. I've established
visual contact...</i>

393
00:28:24,718 --> 00:28:27,432
<i>... with a light at spot access
road by coordinates 28.</i>

394
00:28:27,688 --> 00:28:28,518
We read you.

395
00:28:28,805 --> 00:28:30,530
Circling now to make drop.

396
00:28:30,658 --> 00:28:33,085
This is 33 Foxtrot to special
highway patrol...

397
00:28:33,181 --> 00:28:38,004
<i>units 12 and 22. Move toward access
road near map coordinates 28.</i>

398
00:28:58,794 --> 00:29:01,061
Drop completed. Over and out.

399
00:29:35,905 --> 00:29:36,863
They got it.

400
00:29:37,853 --> 00:29:38,715
Any sign of them?

401
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:42,132
No, sir. There's a highway
only half a mile that way...

402
00:29:42,483 --> 00:29:43,633
...with a lot of heavy traffic.

403
00:29:43,728 --> 00:29:45,837
They must have gotten lost in that
before we even got here.

404
00:29:45,964 --> 00:29:47,210
We knew that going in, didn't we?

405
00:29:47,305 --> 00:29:49,605
Mr.Carlson. Want to look at this?

406
00:29:57,653 --> 00:29:59,122
All right, let's go home.

407
00:30:00,463 --> 00:30:02,827
Lieutenant. Lieutenant Columbo.

408
00:30:04,104 --> 00:30:04,999
Let's go.

409
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:11,737
Hey Lieutenant.
Lieutenant, I'll take that.

410
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:26,947
Are you coming, Lieutenant?

411
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:31,068
No, why don't you go ahead.
I'm going to take a little walk...

412
00:31:31,163 --> 00:31:33,271
...clear my head, you know what
I mean.

413
00:32:59,724 --> 00:33:00,937
How is my father?

414
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:06,558
What are you doing here?

415
00:33:06,782 --> 00:33:07,963
How is he?

416
00:33:08,985 --> 00:33:10,230
Have you heard from him?

417
00:33:10,806 --> 00:33:11,955
No, not yet.

418
00:33:12,402 --> 00:33:14,702
But you paid the kidnappers
the ransom money.

419
00:33:15,405 --> 00:33:16,905
When will they bring him back?

420
00:33:19,588 --> 00:33:20,546
We don't know.

421
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,304
I uh...

422
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:30,159
I wasn't expecting you.

423
00:33:33,002 --> 00:33:36,099
After I got your cable, I caught
the first plane out of Zurich.

424
00:33:37,185 --> 00:33:39,165
There was only a 30 minute layover.

425
00:33:39,964 --> 00:33:41,273
You didn't have to come.

426
00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:43,381
What you mean is you didn't
want me to.

427
00:33:44,403 --> 00:33:46,958
What I mean is that there's
nothing for you to do here.

428
00:33:47,149 --> 00:33:49,352
Let's drop the polite charade Leslie.

429
00:33:49,448 --> 00:33:52,291
I hate you as much as you hate me.
Maybe more.

430
00:33:52,834 --> 00:33:55,325
And you don't have to play the
martyred stepmother to me anymore.

431
00:33:55,421 --> 00:33:56,698
I've outgrown that.

432
00:33:56,954 --> 00:33:59,540
So you see, all the expensive
education in Switzerland...

433
00:33:59,636 --> 00:34:01,169
...isn't a total loss.

434
00:34:01,744 --> 00:34:05,130
Margaret, we're both tired,
we're both upset.

435
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:08,227
I'm sure neither of us wants to say
anything they don't mean...

436
00:34:09,665 --> 00:34:11,740
that we may be sorry for later.

437
00:34:15,509 --> 00:34:19,565
Why don't we get some sleep?
Tomorrow may be a long day.

438
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:33,617
Margaret, I'm worried.
I love him too.

439
00:34:34,894 --> 00:34:39,110
I haven't been able to sleep.
I'm terribly nervous.

440
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,443
Margaret, I'm afraid.

441
00:34:51,597 --> 00:34:53,609
I don't want anything to happen
to him.

442
00:34:53,769 --> 00:34:55,909
I know, I know.

443
00:34:56,005 --> 00:34:58,783
Don't worry. Don't worry.

444
00:35:36,787 --> 00:35:38,257
A little early for the late show.

445
00:35:49,754 --> 00:35:50,775
No calls?

446
00:35:53,107 --> 00:35:54,767
Except to say they haven't heard anything.

447
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,344
They've got fuzz of some kind out
on the street watching the house.

448
00:35:58,855 --> 00:35:59,909
Federal agents.

449
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:03,294
There's nothing in the paper
about Daddy or the kidnappers.

450
00:36:03,646 --> 00:36:07,255
We've kept it out of the press
and off the radio and the television.

451
00:36:09,299 --> 00:36:11,055
I was waiting for the news.

452
00:36:12,269 --> 00:36:13,259
Where are you going?

453
00:36:13,611 --> 00:36:14,728
I have a date in court.

454
00:36:14,824 --> 00:36:18,050
How can you do that?
I mean, how can you function?

455
00:36:18,433 --> 00:36:21,211
It seems like a strange time
to play lady lawyer.

456
00:36:25,746 --> 00:36:27,662
Someday when you take on
responsibilities,

457
00:36:27,758 --> 00:36:29,355
you'll find out that you don't
always have a choice...

458
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:31,079
...that you have to function,
no matter what.

459
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:33,571
I guess I'm lucky
I'm still irresponsible.

460
00:36:34,049 --> 00:36:36,764
Because all I can think about
is my father.

461
00:36:37,722 --> 00:36:38,935
No more than I.

462
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:49,123
Why don't you try to occupy yourself
with something Margaret,

463
00:36:49,219 --> 00:36:53,180
I mean something besides television and
running up overseas telephone bills.

464
00:36:53,755 --> 00:36:55,926
You might find it'll pass the time
more quickly.

465
00:36:56,629 --> 00:36:58,417
I'll call you the moment
I hear anything.

466
00:36:58,897 --> 00:37:00,078
Leslie.

467
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,834
Good luck.

468
00:37:03,463 --> 00:37:04,741
With your case.

469
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,497
Thank you Margaret.

470
00:37:32,557 --> 00:37:36,805
Now when their attorney cross
examines you about the accident, cry.

471
00:37:36,901 --> 00:37:37,859
About what?

472
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:38,913
Everything.

473
00:37:39,008 --> 00:37:41,914
Especially when he asks you how fast
you were going when you hit their car.

474
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,192
Excuse me.

475
00:37:43,735 --> 00:37:45,811
Just sit down there.
Give me the brief. Mike.

476
00:37:49,005 --> 00:37:50,027
Leslie.

477
00:37:51,081 --> 00:37:52,453
Have you found my husband?

478
00:37:52,582 --> 00:37:53,763
Can we talk to you privately
for a moment?

479
00:37:53,859 --> 00:37:54,594
You can tell me here.

480
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:55,807
I think we'd better speak privately.

481
00:37:55,903 --> 00:37:57,692
Just tell me. Did you find my
husband?

482
00:37:57,819 --> 00:37:58,841
Please Mrs.Williams.

483
00:37:58,937 --> 00:38:00,566
Will you tell me. Is he all right?

484
00:38:01,939 --> 00:38:03,408
Your husband is dead, Mrs.Williams.

485
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:13,531
Are you all right Mrs.Williams?

486
00:38:15,225 --> 00:38:16,438
Give me a moment.

487
00:38:17,237 --> 00:38:18,322
Can we get you a doctor?

488
00:38:19,377 --> 00:38:20,973
I'll arrange to have you driven
home.

489
00:38:21,707 --> 00:38:23,112
Get my bag and things.

490
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:28,000
I'm very sorry.

491
00:38:34,706 --> 00:38:35,664
Lieutenant.

492
00:38:37,612 --> 00:38:39,592
Did she ask where the body was?

493
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:40,455
No.

494
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:43,456
I didn't think so.
Oh listen, one more thing Mr.Carlson.

495
00:38:43,808 --> 00:38:46,682
She didn't ask how her husband was
killed, did she?

496
00:38:46,778 --> 00:38:47,353
No.

497
00:38:47,449 --> 00:38:48,438
That's what I thought.

498
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,290
All right Lieutenant,
what's bothering you now?

499
00:38:50,483 --> 00:38:51,472
No, nothing.

500
00:38:51,601 --> 00:38:52,750
Something's bothering you.

501
00:38:52,846 --> 00:38:54,347
It's just that up until now,

502
00:38:54,442 --> 00:38:57,189
you know she was very cool and
she was very composed.

503
00:38:57,477 --> 00:38:59,904
And she suddenly fell apart
in front of other people.

504
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:01,565
I don't see anything so strange
about that.

505
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,257
No? Convenient maybe?

506
00:39:03,353 --> 00:39:05,972
Conve... look Columbo,
if you think she had something...

507
00:39:06,068 --> 00:39:07,952
...to do with the kidnapping just
come out and say so.

508
00:39:08,047 --> 00:39:10,092
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

509
00:39:10,826 --> 00:39:13,157
You asked me what was bothering
me and I told you.

510
00:39:13,253 --> 00:39:14,658
Let's understand this one thing.

511
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:17,117
If you start harassing this woman,
I'm going to take it upstairs.

512
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:21,238
Just one minute Mr.Carlson.
You see it's like this.

513
00:39:21,556 --> 00:39:25,261
This is not just a kidnapping.
This is a murder now.

514
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:29,572
And I kind of figure that's my
department. I'll see you around.

515
00:39:45,957 --> 00:39:48,798
I gave Margaret an injection
and put her to bed.

516
00:39:48,894 --> 00:39:49,981
She'll be asleep soon.

517
00:39:50,076 --> 00:39:51,003
Oh good.

518
00:39:52,215 --> 00:39:53,813
Take two of those before
you go to bed.

519
00:39:53,909 --> 00:39:55,218
They put you out
all night long.

520
00:39:55,314 --> 00:39:58,603
Thank you. I can't thank you enough.
Really, all of you. I...

521
00:39:58,955 --> 00:40:00,360
We'll let you get some rest now.

522
00:40:02,372 --> 00:40:03,394
You're so brave.

523
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:08,025
Call me if you need me.

524
00:40:09,014 --> 00:40:12,495
Good night darling.
Take care of yourself.

525
00:40:14,731 --> 00:40:17,446
Mrs.Williams, we'll be keeping a man
on the house for the next few days.

526
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,298
Is there anything else we can do?

527
00:40:19,393 --> 00:40:20,320
No thank you.

528
00:40:20,575 --> 00:40:21,725
- Good night.
- Good night.

529
00:41:12,377 --> 00:41:13,526
Let us pray.

530
00:41:13,718 --> 00:41:16,720
O Lord, we implore you to grant
your dead mercy to this servant,

531
00:41:17,423 --> 00:41:19,977
That he who held fast to your will
by his intentions,

532
00:41:20,424 --> 00:41:23,235
May not receive punishment in return
for his deeds,

533
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:26,908
So does the true faith united him with
the throng of the faithful on earth,

534
00:41:27,004 --> 00:41:29,111
Your mercy may unite him with
the company of the choirs...

535
00:41:29,207 --> 00:41:31,699
...of Angels in Heaven,
through Christ our Lord.

536
00:41:31,794 --> 00:41:34,029
Eternal rest grant upon him, O Lord,

537
00:41:34,796 --> 00:41:36,808
And let perpetual light shine on him.

538
00:41:37,574 --> 00:41:39,108
May he rest in peace.

539
00:41:39,842 --> 00:41:42,078
May his soul and the souls of
all the faithful departed,

540
00:41:42,174 --> 00:41:43,419
Through the mercy of God,

541
00:41:44,026 --> 00:41:45,431
Rest in peace.

542
00:41:52,361 --> 00:41:56,098
My deepest sympathy to you
Mrs.Williams. I pray you be comforted.

543
00:41:56,545 --> 00:41:58,046
God's peace be with you.

544
00:42:07,244 --> 00:42:08,329
Leslie?

545
00:42:08,681 --> 00:42:09,830
Yes, Margaret?

546
00:42:11,587 --> 00:42:13,535
This is what you wanted, isn't it?

547
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:16,250
Are you all right?

548
00:42:18,645 --> 00:42:19,603
I'm all right.

549
00:42:19,795 --> 00:42:21,136
I'm all right. It's nothing.

550
00:42:25,608 --> 00:42:26,597
I'm all right.

551
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:00,354
Are you all right?

552
00:43:00,706 --> 00:43:02,270
Yes. Thank you.

553
00:43:02,685 --> 00:43:03,643
Who are you?

554
00:43:03,772 --> 00:43:05,975
I'm Lieutenant Columbo.
I'm from the local police.

555
00:43:11,436 --> 00:43:15,683
If there's ever anything you want,
you're not alone.

556
00:43:16,801 --> 00:43:18,781
Remember, I'm always available.

557
00:43:20,922 --> 00:43:22,774
You'd better come.
They're waiting for you.

558
00:43:28,842 --> 00:43:30,598
I see now what you mean about
her, Les.

559
00:43:30,694 --> 00:43:32,833
She's spoiled and completely selfish.

560
00:43:32,929 --> 00:43:34,686
No Pat, you can't blame her.

561
00:43:34,782 --> 00:43:38,710
Paul and I both indulged her
too much I guess. It was our fault.

562
00:43:38,837 --> 00:43:40,371
If she were mine,

563
00:43:40,466 --> 00:43:43,245
stepdaughter or not, I would kick
her out right now, without a dime.

564
00:43:43,341 --> 00:43:46,151
Pat, I think Les should get some rest.

565
00:43:46,247 --> 00:43:47,556
Yes, I think so too.

566
00:43:56,179 --> 00:43:58,351
You've got to make her grow up Les.

567
00:43:58,446 --> 00:43:59,150
Are you all right?

568
00:43:59,245 --> 00:44:01,225
Yes I am now. Thank you very much.

569
00:44:01,321 --> 00:44:02,375
Goodbye Leslie.

570
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:06,910
I have to tell you how much
I appreciate everything.

571
00:44:07,006 --> 00:44:08,890
You have been such good friends.

572
00:44:09,976 --> 00:44:12,722
Paul loved you. He loved you all.
So do I.

573
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,427
We love you. I'll call tomorrow.

574
00:44:31,277 --> 00:44:32,235
Margaret!

575
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,109
Margaret. Come down here, please.

576
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:37,281
I know you're up there listening
so you might as well come down.

577
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:38,974
You called, mother dear?

578
00:44:39,485 --> 00:44:40,954
I think we'd better have a talk.

579
00:44:41,114 --> 00:44:42,360
Of course, mother dear.

580
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:46,895
Margaret, I'm willing to overlook
the incident at the cemetery.

581
00:44:47,437 --> 00:44:49,194
I'll write it off to adolescent
hysteria.

582
00:44:49,289 --> 00:44:53,889
But I am in no mood to tolerate any
further outbursts, sarcasm, anything.

583
00:44:54,751 --> 00:44:55,836
Of course.

584
00:45:01,138 --> 00:45:03,789
You're making it very difficult for us
to live together.

585
00:45:04,396 --> 00:45:06,631
I think you should go back to school
this weekend.

586
00:45:07,429 --> 00:45:11,198
The school doesn't open for another
month. There's nobody there.

587
00:45:11,294 --> 00:45:13,849
You have friends in Paris.
Visit them.

588
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:16,659
Leslie, I'm not going anywhere.
I'm staying right here.

589
00:45:16,756 --> 00:45:17,426
Why?

590
00:45:17,521 --> 00:45:18,959
It's my home too.

591
00:45:25,186 --> 00:45:27,358
Margaret, while we're on the
subject of school,

592
00:45:28,253 --> 00:45:30,488
I think we'd better talk about
something else.

593
00:45:30,712 --> 00:45:31,925
Like what?

594
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:33,202
Finances.

595
00:45:37,194 --> 00:45:39,079
Your father, well, your father and I...

596
00:45:39,175 --> 00:45:41,506
have kept you very sheltered from
our financial affairs but...

597
00:45:41,602 --> 00:45:44,540
...now I think that you are ready
to face certain realities.

598
00:45:44,732 --> 00:45:46,520
I have my own trust account.

599
00:45:46,615 --> 00:45:47,351
You did.

600
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:51,119
I won't bore you with the details,
but since you're a minor,

601
00:45:51,279 --> 00:45:53,833
your father and I had joint control
of that account.

602
00:45:54,121 --> 00:45:55,590
What happened to it?

603
00:45:55,845 --> 00:45:58,528
In order to pay the ransom I was
forced to close that account out,

604
00:45:58,624 --> 00:46:00,093
along with everything else
that we had.

605
00:46:00,189 --> 00:46:02,392
You're trying to tell me that
we're broke. Is that it?

606
00:46:02,489 --> 00:46:04,436
No, it's not as bad as all that.

607
00:46:04,532 --> 00:46:07,726
My law practice and the firm will
provide us...

608
00:46:07,822 --> 00:46:10,472
...with enough to keep us off the
streets of Beverly Hills.

609
00:46:12,165 --> 00:46:14,369
But there will have to be
certain readjustments.

610
00:46:14,784 --> 00:46:16,221
You mean my allowance.

611
00:46:16,828 --> 00:46:18,074
That's a very good example.

612
00:46:19,734 --> 00:46:22,609
How much of a readjustment?

613
00:46:23,279 --> 00:46:25,674
I don't know, I'll have to see
what I can come up with.

614
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:26,760
I'll let you know.

615
00:46:28,165 --> 00:46:30,848
In the meantime, while you're here
for the next couple of weeks,

616
00:46:30,943 --> 00:46:32,764
why don't you try to find
yourself a job?

617
00:46:33,658 --> 00:46:36,883
Pick up some extra cash.
Might come in handy.

618
00:46:52,341 --> 00:46:53,555
May I help you?

619
00:46:54,417 --> 00:46:56,716
Lieutenant Columbo, I had an
appointment.

620
00:46:56,845 --> 00:46:59,208
Oh, of course. Goodness,
you're early.

621
00:46:59,303 --> 00:47:00,453
I know.

622
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:01,698
How did you get in?

623
00:47:01,794 --> 00:47:03,807
Oh, the janitor was nice enough
to let me in.

624
00:47:04,509 --> 00:47:05,882
Mrs.Williams should be here
in a moment.

625
00:47:05,979 --> 00:47:07,351
She's never late for an appointment.

626
00:47:07,447 --> 00:47:10,449
Oh really? Me, I got this terrible
habit. I'm always early.

627
00:47:10,896 --> 00:47:13,132
Whenever I have to be anywhere
I get there ahead of time.

628
00:47:13,771 --> 00:47:15,144
What, are you a legal secretary?

629
00:47:15,878 --> 00:47:17,316
Believe it or not, I'm an attorney.

630
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:19,264
I'm called an associate,

631
00:47:19,392 --> 00:47:22,393
which means that since the secretary
phoned in sick, I have to fill in.

632
00:47:22,745 --> 00:47:23,894
I don't know how you do it.

633
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:24,917
Do what?

634
00:47:25,204 --> 00:47:26,226
Work for a woman.

635
00:47:26,322 --> 00:47:27,759
Well, it doesn't bother me.

636
00:47:28,238 --> 00:47:29,803
It just so happens that she's one
of the best...

637
00:47:29,898 --> 00:47:31,623
...trial attorneys in this state.

638
00:47:32,294 --> 00:47:33,380
Good morning.

639
00:47:33,763 --> 00:47:36,222
Good morning.
Have I kept you waiting?

640
00:47:36,925 --> 00:47:37,883
No, I was early.

641
00:47:37,979 --> 00:47:38,873
Oh good.

642
00:47:39,863 --> 00:47:41,140
Well, won't you come in?

643
00:47:41,236 --> 00:47:42,545
Shall I hold the calls?

644
00:47:50,114 --> 00:47:52,957
I'm sorry to bother you,
the first day back and all.

645
00:47:54,298 --> 00:47:55,671
That's all right Lieutenant.

646
00:47:56,405 --> 00:47:58,674
I understand the federal people
haven't come up with anything

647
00:47:58,961 --> 00:48:01,835
Nothing. Not a word. Not a clue.

648
00:48:03,368 --> 00:48:06,657
Say, that's some telephone.

649
00:48:09,723 --> 00:48:12,374
What are you... You big on
gadgets are you?

650
00:48:13,013 --> 00:48:16,238
No. I just happen to find
that one a great help.

651
00:48:16,909 --> 00:48:20,582
You see, say that I want to
get in touch with a client to be...

652
00:48:20,678 --> 00:48:24,446
...in court, say, Monday for example.
I just tape a message.

653
00:48:25,564 --> 00:48:31,345
And this machine calls my client
and does it for me.

654
00:48:31,568 --> 00:48:34,187
Boy, that's really something.

655
00:48:34,858 --> 00:48:36,965
You know, today they can do everything
electronically.

656
00:48:37,061 --> 00:48:39,265
I mean, if they wanted to.
I'd bet on that.

657
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:42,107
You don't mind if I take down
the name of this, do you?

658
00:48:42,267 --> 00:48:43,480
I mean, maybe I could...

659
00:48:43,576 --> 00:48:46,163
...con the department into
getting one for my office.

660
00:48:47,153 --> 00:48:49,516
You have a pen? Thank you.

661
00:48:49,612 --> 00:48:50,762
These things, they really fascinate me.

662
00:48:50,858 --> 00:48:52,486
You know they got a new thing today.

663
00:48:53,508 --> 00:48:55,776
Like if I want to take my wife
to the ballgame,

664
00:48:57,054 --> 00:49:00,406
I just dial this service.
For the tickets.

665
00:49:00,918 --> 00:49:05,101
And it's all done by computer.
It's really... it's unbelievable.

666
00:49:07,113 --> 00:49:09,892
What did you want to see me about
Lieutenant exactly?

667
00:49:10,499 --> 00:49:12,543
Uh... you see Mrs.Williams,

668
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:15,193
now that a murder has been
committed,

669
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:20,175
it's my job to look at this case
from all possible angles.

670
00:49:20,495 --> 00:49:22,986
I would think it would be your job
to catch the kidnapper.

671
00:49:23,082 --> 00:49:24,391
Oh, the federal agents are on that.

672
00:49:24,487 --> 00:49:26,148
And of course we have our men
on it too.

673
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:27,936
Very reassuring.

674
00:49:28,064 --> 00:49:30,203
Yes it is. Because they do a
fine job.

675
00:49:30,299 --> 00:49:32,695
But you see, the thing is with me...
uh...

676
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:35,377
I'm a strange guy.

677
00:49:35,537 --> 00:49:36,336
Really?

678
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:38,763
I worry. I mean little things
bother me.

679
00:49:39,177 --> 00:49:41,222
I'm a worrier. I mean...

680
00:49:41,317 --> 00:49:44,416
Little insignificant details,
I lose my appetite, I can't eat.

681
00:49:45,118 --> 00:49:48,407
My wife she says to me, you know,
you can really be a pain.

682
00:49:48,758 --> 00:49:49,557
You know what I mean.

683
00:49:49,876 --> 00:49:51,761
Yeah, I get the general picture.

684
00:49:53,262 --> 00:49:55,082
Why don't you get on with it.

685
00:49:55,369 --> 00:49:56,934
Oh yeah, sure. Right.

686
00:49:57,765 --> 00:49:59,457
Well you see there are certain
things here...

687
00:49:59,553 --> 00:50:03,641
about your husband's kidnapping that...
certain details that...

688
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:05,717
Does this lighter work?

689
00:50:14,851 --> 00:50:16,480
Well, they really nag me.

690
00:50:16,767 --> 00:50:17,694
Such as...?

691
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,833
The bag, for instance.

692
00:50:20,887 --> 00:50:21,717
Which bag?

693
00:50:22,643 --> 00:50:24,081
The one you dropped from the plane.

694
00:50:24,176 --> 00:50:25,805
The one with the ransom money in it.

695
00:50:27,115 --> 00:50:28,647
Didn't I say which bag it was?

696
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:29,798
No,you didn't.

697
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:33,502
I'm sorry. I thought I did.

698
00:50:33,597 --> 00:50:34,588
What about the bag?

699
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,334
I just thought it's funny...

700
00:50:37,749 --> 00:50:39,537
...that whoever took the money
out of the bag,

701
00:50:39,697 --> 00:50:41,039
they didn't take the bag with them.

702
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:42,667
What's so funny about that?

703
00:50:42,763 --> 00:50:43,913
You figure a kidnapper,

704
00:50:44,009 --> 00:50:46,468
he's afraid to get caught
so he's not likely to stop,

705
00:50:46,755 --> 00:50:48,767
open a bag, take the money out,

706
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:51,610
then run away and leave
the bag behind.

707
00:50:52,888 --> 00:50:55,569
Well of course you know more than
I do Lieutenant.

708
00:50:55,666 --> 00:50:57,231
But don't people under stress...

709
00:50:57,454 --> 00:51:01,702
...act more out of immediate
emotion than logic?

710
00:51:01,829 --> 00:51:03,171
That's absolutely true.

711
00:51:03,714 --> 00:51:05,981
In fact, I'll go even further.

712
00:51:06,461 --> 00:51:09,015
That's what does most criminals in
eventually.

713
00:51:10,038 --> 00:51:12,464
Well then isn't it safe to assume
that...

714
00:51:12,943 --> 00:51:15,531
...they would open the bag to see
if the money was there.

715
00:51:15,913 --> 00:51:19,043
And then after they saw it,
out of fear or panic,

716
00:51:19,139 --> 00:51:21,342
take the money out of the bag
and run.

717
00:51:21,438 --> 00:51:22,652
Yeah, that's probably right.

718
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:25,335
That's probably right.
I'm sure that is right.

719
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:28,880
I mean, I don't mean to defend my
point about the bag...

720
00:51:29,135 --> 00:51:32,999
I was just using that as an example
to show you the kind of person I am.

721
00:51:33,479 --> 00:51:35,458
You understand how details bother me.

722
00:51:35,969 --> 00:51:40,026
In other words, I'm trying to show you
a whatyoumacallit of mine, a...

723
00:51:40,217 --> 00:51:41,431
An idiosyncrasy.

724
00:51:41,655 --> 00:51:43,571
Right. Idiosyncrasy.

725
00:51:45,136 --> 00:51:47,595
Gee, that's a good word.

726
00:51:47,786 --> 00:51:48,968
Oh, one of the best.

727
00:51:52,577 --> 00:51:53,311
Anything else?

728
00:51:53,886 --> 00:51:55,036
Uh, no.

729
00:51:56,601 --> 00:51:58,325
No. I guess that's it.

730
00:52:01,998 --> 00:52:05,352
Listen, I want to thank you for
taking the time to talk to me,

731
00:52:05,447 --> 00:52:07,140
I really appreciate that.

732
00:52:07,555 --> 00:52:09,440
It certainly helped straighten things out
in my mind.

733
00:52:09,982 --> 00:52:11,323
Any time, Lieutenant.

734
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:12,410
Thank you again.

735
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:15,091
What? Something else?

736
00:52:15,444 --> 00:52:17,200
I don't know what's the matter with me.

737
00:52:17,296 --> 00:52:19,148
One other thing. The angle of
the bullet.

738
00:52:19,819 --> 00:52:20,649
What about it?

739
00:52:20,968 --> 00:52:24,098
Well, the bullet entered your husband's
body at a 45 degree angle.

740
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:26,844
What's the significance in that?

741
00:52:27,037 --> 00:52:30,038
Well, that means your husband was
standing, and...

742
00:52:30,932 --> 00:52:32,050
See the way you're standing?

743
00:52:33,871 --> 00:52:35,020
<i>Leslie, I thought...</i>

744
00:52:35,371 --> 00:52:38,118
Just the way you're standing.
You see just the way you're standing.

745
00:52:38,214 --> 00:52:41,344
The killer was sitting just the
way I am.

746
00:52:42,046 --> 00:52:43,324
And from this position,

747
00:52:45,847 --> 00:52:47,092
the killer shot him.

748
00:52:51,436 --> 00:52:52,457
I'm sorry.

749
00:52:55,524 --> 00:53:00,026
Could you... a little water
on the table.

750
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:07,500
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
upset you.

751
00:53:07,595 --> 00:53:08,873
That's all right. That's all right.

752
00:53:08,969 --> 00:53:10,502
Please go on with what you
were saying.

753
00:53:11,141 --> 00:53:12,897
Listen, I can come back another
time.

754
00:53:13,535 --> 00:53:16,058
No, really. I'm all right.
I want to hear.

755
00:53:16,538 --> 00:53:17,783
Are you sure you're all right?

756
00:53:19,157 --> 00:53:21,616
There's not much else to say about it,
it's just...

757
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:24,969
...it's just another one of those
things that bothers me.

758
00:53:25,832 --> 00:53:28,355
I mean, what was your husband doing?

759
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:33,113
Was he just standing there while
some guy sitting down shot him?

760
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,061
Well at this point,

761
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:37,807
there's no way of really knowing
what happened is there?

762
00:53:37,936 --> 00:53:40,426
Right. You're right about that.
Right.

763
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:43,907
But the other thing that was
peculiar...

764
00:53:44,003 --> 00:53:45,025
There's something else?

765
00:53:45,312 --> 00:53:47,676
Your husband, he was shot with
a.22 caliber revolver.

766
00:53:48,922 --> 00:53:51,956
Well most criminals, they use
a.32 or maybe a.38.

767
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:53,904
But this one was different.

768
00:53:53,999 --> 00:53:54,798
It sure was.

769
00:53:54,989 --> 00:53:57,863
And I tried to figure it.
Why a.22?

770
00:53:58,343 --> 00:53:59,684
That's interesting.

771
00:54:00,068 --> 00:54:01,951
Yes, you see, that is interesting.

772
00:54:02,462 --> 00:54:04,667
What if he wanted to fire into
someone,

773
00:54:04,826 --> 00:54:06,103
and be reasonably certain...

774
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:08,882
...that the bullet didn't have
the velocity to go through the body.

775
00:54:08,978 --> 00:54:09,904
But why?

776
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,309
Because he didn't want any trace...

777
00:54:11,405 --> 00:54:13,448
...of the crime in the room
where he shot him.

778
00:54:14,726 --> 00:54:18,303
Well, you've given these details
of yours a lot of thought Lieutenant.

779
00:54:18,399 --> 00:54:20,826
Listen, I know all these things
don't seem like much.

780
00:54:20,986 --> 00:54:23,189
Put them all together one on top
of the other,

781
00:54:23,445 --> 00:54:27,405
and I'm telling you, that
kidnapping just doesn't add up.

782
00:54:27,788 --> 00:54:29,129
Let me understand you correctly.

783
00:54:29,225 --> 00:54:32,994
Are you implying that this was
perhaps not an ordinary kidnapping?

784
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:35,613
That's right. That's interesting,
isn't it?

785
00:54:35,932 --> 00:54:38,168
Now what if someone set out
to murder your husband,

786
00:54:38,296 --> 00:54:40,244
and he only made it look like
a kidnapping?

787
00:54:40,339 --> 00:54:42,191
And so the ransom money,
all that was a set up.

788
00:54:42,287 --> 00:54:43,885
Yes, that's possible.

789
00:54:44,267 --> 00:54:45,801
Look how that throws us off.

790
00:54:46,312 --> 00:54:48,515
We're looking for kidnappers
that don't exist.

791
00:54:48,642 --> 00:54:52,412
And in the meantime the real killer is
so close by we can't even see him.

792
00:54:52,507 --> 00:54:54,551
And all these little details of yours
fall into place.

793
00:54:54,647 --> 00:54:55,637
The angle of the gun.

794
00:54:55,733 --> 00:54:56,755
Exactly.

795
00:54:56,851 --> 00:55:00,683
Shot by someone he knew
while the murderer was sitting down.

796
00:55:01,162 --> 00:55:02,407
The caliber of the bullet.

797
00:55:02,504 --> 00:55:05,537
Right. Killed in a room where
he didn't want to leave any traces.

798
00:55:05,633 --> 00:55:07,677
No bullet holes in the wall,
for example.

799
00:55:07,773 --> 00:55:08,986
The empty bag?

800
00:55:09,753 --> 00:55:12,052
That's a puzzler.
I can't figure that one out yet.

801
00:55:12,148 --> 00:55:15,214
Lieutenant, in all honesty,
I must tell you you have collected...

802
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:18,120
...one of the most absurd
hypotheses I have ever heard.

803
00:55:18,216 --> 00:55:21,537
Nothing that you've said proves
anything, one way or another.

804
00:55:21,761 --> 00:55:23,645
I know that. I'm not a lawyer.

805
00:55:23,741 --> 00:55:25,721
And maybe my theories are not
as good as they should be.

806
00:55:25,817 --> 00:55:29,234
But Mrs. Williams, I've been a cop
for a long, long time.

807
00:55:29,394 --> 00:55:31,150
And after a few years, believe me,

808
00:55:31,406 --> 00:55:32,939
the old nose gets to be pretty good.

809
00:55:33,035 --> 00:55:34,088
What do you want from me?

810
00:55:34,184 --> 00:55:35,142
You know how you could help me?

811
00:55:35,238 --> 00:55:37,825
If you would just talk to me
about your husband, yourself,

812
00:55:38,081 --> 00:55:41,115
and maybe I can come up with somebody,
a business associate, a friend...

813
00:55:41,211 --> 00:55:44,563
Who knows? But somebody who might
have a motive to kill him.

814
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:45,586
And if you can't?

815
00:55:45,714 --> 00:55:48,333
Federal men are working on
the kidnapping. There's no harm done.

816
00:55:50,409 --> 00:55:52,548
Lieutenant, I don't hold with
this murder theory of yours.

817
00:55:52,644 --> 00:55:55,102
Mrs.Williams, you're perfectly
within your rights.

818
00:55:55,199 --> 00:55:58,201
Lieutenant, let me finish. But I will
do whatever I can to help you.

819
00:55:58,328 --> 00:56:00,500
Whoever it was killed my husband,
for whatever reason,

820
00:56:00,596 --> 00:56:02,001
I want him found.

821
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,077
I was hoping you'd say that.

822
00:56:06,951 --> 00:56:10,081
Michael, Lieutenant Columbo and I will
be at the airport if you need us.

823
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:12,285
Why will we be there?

824
00:56:12,381 --> 00:56:14,775
I try to get in a few hours flying at
least 2 days a week,

825
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:16,213
and this is one of those days.

826
00:56:16,532 --> 00:56:18,097
Besides, I feel as if I want to
get away from here.

827
00:56:18,193 --> 00:56:19,375
Come with me, we'll talk.

828
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:20,588
Where? In the plane?

829
00:56:21,833 --> 00:56:23,942
Lieutenant, are you afraid of flying?

830
00:56:25,283 --> 00:56:28,349
Well, it's not one of my favorite
pastimes.

831
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:19,447
It's a great release for me
being up here Lieutenant.

832
00:57:20,022 --> 00:57:22,673
All alone. Totally free.

833
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:25,899
I do some of my best thinking up
here.

834
00:57:26,441 --> 00:57:27,335
No kidding.

835
00:57:27,591 --> 00:57:28,581
No kidding.

836
00:57:43,496 --> 00:57:45,987
Mrs.Williams, would you not do that?

837
00:57:46,593 --> 00:57:47,648
You're nervous.

838
00:57:47,999 --> 00:57:49,467
No offense. I'm like this in a car.

839
00:57:49,564 --> 00:57:51,160
I'm always nervous when I'm not
driving.

840
00:57:51,416 --> 00:57:52,853
Would you like to take over?

841
00:57:53,843 --> 00:57:54,513
I beg your pardon?

842
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:56,973
I could teach you how to handle
the plane in an hour.

843
00:57:57,069 --> 00:57:59,528
Oh yes, well, really that would
be wasted on me.

844
00:57:59,623 --> 00:58:01,284
I don't intend to fly again.

845
00:58:01,764 --> 00:58:04,734
You make me feel terrible.
Flying is a wonderful experience.

846
00:58:04,829 --> 00:58:05,723
I've ruined it for you.

847
00:58:05,819 --> 00:58:08,151
No, you haven't. I've never been
crazy about flying actually.

848
00:58:08,246 --> 00:58:10,961
That's because you've never done it.
What we don't know, we fear.

849
00:58:11,216 --> 00:58:12,366
Take the controls.

850
00:58:12,814 --> 00:58:14,826
No, I'd rather not, thank you.

851
00:58:14,921 --> 00:58:16,678
Try it. I want you to feel
what happens.

852
00:58:16,838 --> 00:58:19,168
Really, that's very, very kind of you,
and I appreciate that.

853
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:21,244
Why don't you just describe
it to me?

854
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:24,407
I want to show you how easy
it is Lieutenant. Are you ready?

855
00:58:24,725 --> 00:58:25,843
Ready for what?

856
00:58:26,227 --> 00:58:27,153
Here we go.

857
00:58:27,855 --> 00:58:29,963
Here. You take the controls.

858
00:58:39,161 --> 00:58:40,566
That's a mountain up ahead.

859
00:58:41,237 --> 00:58:42,004
What do I do?

860
00:58:42,099 --> 00:58:43,440
Turn the wheel to the left.

861
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,539
Keep your feet off the rudder pedal,
pull back on the wheel Lieutenant.

862
00:58:46,634 --> 00:58:48,518
No, no, not too much. Not too much.

863
00:58:48,615 --> 00:58:50,690
You've overcorrected.
Keep the plane's nose up.

864
00:58:50,785 --> 00:58:52,574
You see you have to treat the plane
like a woman.

865
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:53,948
You have to treat it gently.

866
00:58:54,235 --> 00:58:57,269
You have to treat her very
gently. See?

867
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:58,961
Watch out for that peak.

868
00:58:59,057 --> 00:59:01,166
Pull it up. Pull it up.
Come on, Lieutenant.

869
00:59:01,261 --> 00:59:03,209
Up... Up... Up.

870
00:59:03,305 --> 00:59:04,263
Pull it up.

871
00:59:07,553 --> 00:59:11,545
That was brilliant, Lieutenant.
You're going to make an ace pilot.

872
00:59:15,824 --> 00:59:16,687
Like it?

873
00:59:18,379 --> 00:59:20,519
I'd appreciate it if we didn't
talk for a while.

874
00:59:22,595 --> 00:59:23,520
Sure.

875
00:59:38,052 --> 00:59:39,138
Can you talk yet?

876
00:59:39,553 --> 00:59:40,479
Not yet.

877
01:00:04,527 --> 01:00:05,485
Ready?

878
01:00:07,274 --> 01:00:10,404
Ask me anything, I'll try to help
you any way I can.

879
01:00:10,978 --> 01:00:12,607
Did you ever teach your husband
how to fly?

880
01:00:13,885 --> 01:00:15,482
No, he wouldn't learn.

881
01:00:17,972 --> 01:00:19,123
Any other questions?

882
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:24,009
Well Mrs.Williams, did your husband
have any personal enemies?

883
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:28,735
He didn't have any personal enemies.
Everyone admired my husband.

884
01:00:29,469 --> 01:00:31,833
And he was respected by his
fellow attorneys.

885
01:00:32,376 --> 01:00:33,845
They elected him president...

886
01:00:33,941 --> 01:00:37,422
...of the local bar association
for five consecutive years.

887
01:00:37,518 --> 01:00:39,754
But you know sometimes behind
the applause,

888
01:00:40,201 --> 01:00:41,989
there might be somebody who's
envious, somebody...

889
01:00:42,084 --> 01:00:43,937
...who resents all that success.

890
01:00:44,065 --> 01:00:46,172
If there was such a person
I never met him.

891
01:00:46,971 --> 01:00:47,801
What else?

892
01:00:49,877 --> 01:00:53,518
Uh... this is not an easy question.
You understand that?

893
01:00:53,774 --> 01:00:54,635
Go on.

894
01:00:54,732 --> 01:00:55,658
Did your husband ever have...

895
01:00:55,753 --> 01:00:58,245
...any other relationships
with any other women?

896
01:00:59,363 --> 01:01:01,502
My husband was never unfaithful
to me.

897
01:01:02,493 --> 01:01:04,121
How do you know that?
How can you be sure?

898
01:01:04,951 --> 01:01:08,751
Because he had a rigid code of
ethics from which he never deviated.

899
01:01:09,231 --> 01:01:10,667
He must have been quite a man.

900
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:12,425
There was nobody like him.

901
01:01:15,395 --> 01:01:17,567
I'm sorry I can't be of more help
to you.

902
01:01:17,694 --> 01:01:19,227
No, it's all right. You've
been of help.

903
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:21,910
This is a process of elimination,
you understand that?

904
01:01:24,177 --> 01:01:25,231
No other questions?

905
01:01:25,327 --> 01:01:27,530
No, I guess not.

906
01:01:29,224 --> 01:01:30,213
Then we'll head back.

907
01:02:17,192 --> 01:02:18,214
You all right?

908
01:02:21,408 --> 01:02:23,579
Yeah. I'm fine.

909
01:02:23,867 --> 01:02:25,016
Did you enjoy yourself?

910
01:02:26,038 --> 01:02:28,721
Well, it was quite an experience.

911
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,691
I mean, I know what you mean now about
relaxing up there.

912
01:02:31,787 --> 01:02:34,470
Because when I first started out
I was very tense, but now...

913
01:02:34,948 --> 01:02:37,280
Anytime. Anytime Lieutenant.

914
01:02:39,739 --> 01:02:44,945
Say, you know I have this cousin Ralph,
his name is Ralph.

915
01:02:45,743 --> 01:02:49,033
Anyway, Ralph was the greatest
at everything, you know, I mean, he...

916
01:02:49,128 --> 01:02:51,620
...thought better, he talked
better, he made out better.

917
01:02:52,258 --> 01:02:55,292
Ralph was the greatest.
I mean Ralph, boy.

918
01:02:55,995 --> 01:02:58,007
that Ralph was something.
I'll tell you that.

919
01:02:58,262 --> 01:02:59,572
I'll never forget him.

920
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:02,190
Is there a point to this story
Lieutenant?

921
01:03:03,596 --> 01:03:04,873
- A point?
- A point.

922
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:08,322
No I don't think there's a point,
except, maybe,

923
01:03:08,769 --> 01:03:11,516
you know, maybe what it was is that
when you were talking about your husband...

924
01:03:11,612 --> 01:03:14,070
...in the plane I guess that
reminded me of Ralph.

925
01:03:14,486 --> 01:03:16,882
You see, because Ralph, he was
a bore.

926
01:03:17,647 --> 01:03:21,224
I mean, he was so perfect there
were times I felt like killing him.

927
01:03:27,548 --> 01:03:29,081
Yes, well...

928
01:03:30,805 --> 01:03:32,562
I have to change now Lieutenant.

929
01:04:11,301 --> 01:04:14,367
That's all fellas. My mind
is some place else.

930
01:04:25,928 --> 01:04:27,270
Hey Lieutenant.

931
01:04:27,365 --> 01:04:28,388
What do you say, Bert.

932
01:04:28,483 --> 01:04:29,664
What's the use of kicking.

933
01:04:32,475 --> 01:04:36,467
You know what's your trouble?
You don't have much imagination.

934
01:04:36,658 --> 01:04:37,649
What do you mean by that?

935
01:04:37,745 --> 01:04:40,203
You always look at the menu
and you always order chili.

936
01:04:40,555 --> 01:04:41,897
My god, you know, that's true.

937
01:04:44,707 --> 01:04:45,601
What'll it be?

938
01:04:45,696 --> 01:04:47,038
I'll have the chili, Bert.

939
01:04:47,134 --> 01:04:48,219
See what I mean?

940
01:04:49,146 --> 01:04:52,307
Well, look at it this way.
You'll never be disappointed.

941
01:04:52,595 --> 01:04:54,096
Hey, you got something there.

942
01:04:55,980 --> 01:05:00,419
All right Bullet, chili, for
the Lieutenant and make it special.

943
01:05:14,568 --> 01:05:16,004
Lieutenant Columbo?

944
01:05:18,144 --> 01:05:20,412
I'm Margaret Williams.
You remember me?

945
01:05:21,817 --> 01:05:26,320
Oh yes, of course.
I just didn't expect to see you here.

946
01:05:26,895 --> 01:05:28,779
Listen, try the chili,
you won't be sorry.

947
01:05:29,386 --> 01:05:30,918
Lieutenant, I came to see you.

948
01:05:31,174 --> 01:05:32,324
What? What about?

949
01:05:32,452 --> 01:05:33,889
My father's murder.

950
01:05:34,112 --> 01:05:36,604
Listen, I'm terribly sorry about that.

951
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:39,223
We just haven't been able to come up
with anything on that.

952
01:05:44,971 --> 01:05:46,696
Well I may have something.

953
01:05:47,430 --> 01:05:48,771
Are you sure you won't have
something to eat?

954
01:05:49,346 --> 01:05:51,486
Lieutenant this is very important.

955
01:05:52,221 --> 01:05:55,319
Oh. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
I'm listening.

956
01:05:58,161 --> 01:06:00,077
Could we move to that booth
over there?

957
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:02,728
Certainly.

958
01:06:17,258 --> 01:06:20,037
You see, it's the crackers that make
the dish.

959
01:06:24,987 --> 01:06:27,606
I think my stepmother may have had
something to do with it.

960
01:06:28,724 --> 01:06:30,162
You realize what you're saying?

961
01:06:31,534 --> 01:06:32,333
Then tell me.

962
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:34,313
She never loved him.

963
01:06:34,792 --> 01:06:38,305
She used him to get what she wanted
for herself, a career.

964
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:41,307
She used his name, his influence,

965
01:06:41,499 --> 01:06:43,894
so that she could become the famous
lady lawyer.

966
01:06:44,629 --> 01:06:47,822
And to be a partner with my father
was instant stature.

967
01:06:48,077 --> 01:06:49,387
Instant success.

968
01:06:50,249 --> 01:06:52,229
When did all this start?

969
01:06:52,325 --> 01:06:54,114
Did this start while your mother
was still alive?

970
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:57,244
Yes. But he didn't have an affair
with her.

971
01:06:57,786 --> 01:06:59,032
How can you be sure of that?

972
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:01,779
I knew him. He was faithful...

973
01:07:01,874 --> 01:07:05,004
...to my mother all through
those last years while she was dying.

974
01:07:05,132 --> 01:07:07,623
When did they get together
romantically?

975
01:07:07,879 --> 01:07:09,443
After my mother died.

976
01:07:09,635 --> 01:07:11,998
She talked him into leaving
the State Supreme Court.

977
01:07:12,413 --> 01:07:15,288
Something he'd worked for
all his life but he left it.

978
01:07:15,830 --> 01:07:17,523
Because he wanted to be with her.

979
01:07:20,430 --> 01:07:21,962
Is that when they became partners?

980
01:07:22,953 --> 01:07:24,134
That was the bait.

981
01:07:25,443 --> 01:07:27,423
He did that for her,
so she married him.

982
01:07:28,317 --> 01:07:29,915
Why would she want to see
him dead?

983
01:07:30,170 --> 01:07:33,332
My father came to visit me
in Switzerland during last vacation.

984
01:07:33,427 --> 01:07:35,663
Then he told me what a fool
he'd been.

985
01:07:36,653 --> 01:07:40,294
How she finally told him
that she thought he was a bore,

986
01:07:40,677 --> 01:07:44,445
a dull, tiresome old man, and
she wanted a new arrangement.

987
01:07:45,723 --> 01:07:50,035
He started to cry.
I'd never seen him cry before.

988
01:07:52,174 --> 01:07:55,048
He was to quit the firm,
turn it over to her.

989
01:07:55,847 --> 01:07:58,018
Then they were to live
their separate lives.

990
01:07:58,658 --> 01:08:00,190
She didn't ask for a divorce.

991
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:03,097
Just that they share the house
and nothing more.

992
01:08:03,511 --> 01:08:06,705
He could never stomach living a lie
like that and he told her so.

993
01:08:07,728 --> 01:08:09,197
She just laughed at him.

994
01:08:13,092 --> 01:08:16,255
I put my arm around him.
I didn't know what else to do.

995
01:08:19,289 --> 01:08:20,247
So what did he do?

996
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:23,760
He threatened to throw her out
and close down the office.

997
01:08:24,175 --> 01:08:28,071
He dared to stand up to her.
I think that's why he was killed.

998
01:08:28,997 --> 01:08:30,242
Well, now look Margaret.

999
01:08:30,977 --> 01:08:32,254
You've told me some reasons...

1000
01:08:32,447 --> 01:08:34,906
...why maybe your stepmother
might have a motive.

1001
01:08:35,001 --> 01:08:36,375
But they're all true.

1002
01:08:36,535 --> 01:08:38,035
I didn't say they weren't.

1003
01:08:38,546 --> 01:08:40,654
But you don't have any proof
of anything.

1004
01:08:41,357 --> 01:08:44,742
And you don't have any evidence.
All you have is your assumptions.

1005
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:48,095
You understand?
Besides, how could she do it?

1006
01:08:49,277 --> 01:08:52,183
What would she do?
Involve some other people?

1007
01:08:54,259 --> 01:08:55,951
That would be very risky
wouldn't it?

1008
01:08:57,357 --> 01:08:59,976
Now you see, the only possible
way would be...

1009
01:09:01,381 --> 01:09:03,616
No. No that's crazy.

1010
01:09:03,936 --> 01:09:04,734
What is it?

1011
01:09:05,405 --> 01:09:06,427
It just occurred to me that...

1012
01:09:07,001 --> 01:09:09,876
...the only possible way would
be if somehow,

1013
01:09:10,770 --> 01:09:12,080
there never was a kidnapping.

1014
01:09:12,335 --> 01:09:14,826
She killed him. Then set it
up to look that way.

1015
01:09:14,922 --> 01:09:18,850
I never said that. I mean, that's a
crazy idea. Forget that idea.

1016
01:09:19,105 --> 01:09:21,597
Lieutenant how do you go about
proving something like that?

1017
01:09:21,692 --> 01:09:23,544
Oh goodness. I don't know
how to do that.

1018
01:09:23,673 --> 01:09:25,205
Listen, I think you got a crazy
idea there.

1019
01:09:25,301 --> 01:09:26,674
I think you ought to forget about it.

1020
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:30,762
Well, I'll be in touch with you
Lieutenant.

1021
01:09:31,082 --> 01:09:32,710
All right. All right.

1022
01:09:33,637 --> 01:09:36,032
You know, there might be something
in the position of the car seat.

1023
01:09:36,128 --> 01:09:37,469
Did you say something?

1024
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:41,014
I said there might be something
in the position of the car seat.

1025
01:09:41,397 --> 01:09:42,451
What car seat?

1026
01:09:42,547 --> 01:09:43,793
Your father's car.

1027
01:09:44,271 --> 01:09:47,337
You know the night they picked up
your father's car, somebody noticed...

1028
01:09:47,561 --> 01:09:49,669
...that the car seat had been
moved forward.

1029
01:09:53,118 --> 01:09:54,332
I don't understand.

1030
01:09:54,939 --> 01:09:56,408
Well, your father is
a very tall man isn't he?

1031
01:09:56,504 --> 01:09:57,909
I mean he's six foot or better.

1032
01:09:58,643 --> 01:10:02,731
Whoever drove that car last,
they had moved the seat forward.

1033
01:10:03,115 --> 01:10:04,264
Like a woman?

1034
01:10:04,455 --> 01:10:05,414
Could be.

1035
01:10:06,116 --> 01:10:07,841
And of course there's your
father's keys.

1036
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:09,342
What about them?

1037
01:10:09,693 --> 01:10:10,524
We never found them.

1038
01:10:11,354 --> 01:10:12,631
The keys weren't in the car.

1039
01:10:13,142 --> 01:10:14,835
And later on, when we found
your father's body,

1040
01:10:14,930 --> 01:10:16,687
the keys weren't on the body
either.

1041
01:10:16,911 --> 01:10:17,613
So?

1042
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:19,753
Did you ever notice how just out
of habit,

1043
01:10:19,849 --> 01:10:23,393
when you get out of a car, you
automatically reach for the keys?

1044
01:10:25,565 --> 01:10:28,728
You see, the last person out of
that car instinctively...

1045
01:10:29,430 --> 01:10:30,292
...took the keys with them.

1046
01:10:30,484 --> 01:10:32,240
And may still have them.

1047
01:11:05,901 --> 01:11:06,892
Police department?

1048
01:11:07,274 --> 01:11:09,702
I'd like to speak to Lieutenant
Columbo, please.

1049
01:11:29,151 --> 01:11:30,205
Mrs.Williams.

1050
01:11:32,217 --> 01:11:33,430
Mrs.Williams.

1051
01:11:34,293 --> 01:11:35,187
What is it?

1052
01:11:35,283 --> 01:11:36,944
I got the telephone call,
I came right over.

1053
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,093
I didn't call you.

1054
01:11:38,604 --> 01:11:40,872
I know that. It was your
stepdaughter Margaret.

1055
01:11:40,968 --> 01:11:42,150
How did you get in here?

1056
01:11:42,245 --> 01:11:43,969
She said she was going to
leave the door open.

1057
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:47,706
I don't understand.
Why? Why did she call you?

1058
01:11:47,802 --> 01:11:49,271
She said she had something
to show me.

1059
01:11:55,212 --> 01:11:57,447
Margaret. Margaret!

1060
01:11:57,735 --> 01:11:58,884
You want me?

1061
01:11:59,203 --> 01:12:02,270
Yes. Lieutenant Columbo is here
to see you.

1062
01:12:02,525 --> 01:12:04,600
No. I think he's here
to see both of us.

1063
01:12:04,824 --> 01:12:05,591
Are you?

1064
01:12:05,782 --> 01:12:08,528
I thought he might like to
know that I found these keys.

1065
01:12:08,817 --> 01:12:11,754
My father's keyring.
And in your bedroom.

1066
01:12:13,319 --> 01:12:15,555
Margaret, you say these are
your father's keys?

1067
01:12:15,651 --> 01:12:18,365
Lieutenant could you explain
the importance of these keys?

1068
01:12:18,461 --> 01:12:19,930
It isn't at all clear to me.

1069
01:12:20,154 --> 01:12:22,421
Well, you see Mrs.Williams,
it goes like this.

1070
01:12:22,804 --> 01:12:25,615
The keys were not in the car and
were not on your husband's body,

1071
01:12:25,711 --> 01:12:27,595
So we were wondering what
happened to them.

1072
01:12:27,723 --> 01:12:29,448
My father was never kidnapped.

1073
01:12:29,862 --> 01:12:31,842
He came home that night
and you killed him.

1074
01:12:31,938 --> 01:12:33,248
Oh, Margaret.

1075
01:12:33,343 --> 01:12:35,803
You really don't know
what you're talking about.

1076
01:12:35,899 --> 01:12:36,984
Yes I do!

1077
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:38,677
Oh, Lieutenant, I can't do
anything with her...

1078
01:12:38,773 --> 01:12:41,423
It's true. You killed him.
It's true.

1079
01:12:41,519 --> 01:12:43,308
Lieutenant you know it's true.

1080
01:12:43,499 --> 01:12:45,033
Now, wait a minute.
Just one moment.

1081
01:12:45,129 --> 01:12:47,236
Go sit down.
Sit down in that chair.

1082
01:12:50,206 --> 01:12:51,547
Listen to me Margaret.

1083
01:12:52,058 --> 01:12:54,614
What you're saying might mean
something except for one point.

1084
01:12:55,316 --> 01:12:56,881
These are not your father's keys.

1085
01:12:57,711 --> 01:12:58,893
Margaret I've had the house watched,

1086
01:12:58,989 --> 01:13:00,745
And you had a locksmith up
here yesterday.

1087
01:13:01,512 --> 01:13:04,322
And I've got an invoice of every
duplicate key you had made.

1088
01:13:05,216 --> 01:13:07,388
Now I'm going to overlook
what you did this time,

1089
01:13:07,483 --> 01:13:08,857
But I want you to remember something.

1090
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:10,677
Forging evidence is a crime.

1091
01:13:10,773 --> 01:13:12,083
But she killed him.

1092
01:13:12,178 --> 01:13:13,169
There is no proof of that.

1093
01:13:13,265 --> 01:13:15,148
She did it. I know it.
And you know it.

1094
01:13:15,244 --> 01:13:17,767
No, I don't know it.
Yes, you do!

1095
01:13:20,067 --> 01:13:23,069
Young lady, don't you ever do
that again.

1096
01:13:33,927 --> 01:13:36,482
How could she think a thing like
that Lieutenant?

1097
01:13:36,770 --> 01:13:38,367
I always knew that she resented
me.

1098
01:13:38,462 --> 01:13:41,145
But I never thought that
she would go this far.

1099
01:13:43,317 --> 01:13:45,393
I'm going to have to tell you
the truth Mrs.Williams.

1100
01:13:47,117 --> 01:13:48,203
I knew how she felt.

1101
01:13:48,299 --> 01:13:52,610
You see the fact is she came to me
the other day and she told me...

1102
01:13:52,706 --> 01:13:54,303
...that she thought you were
involved.

1103
01:13:55,899 --> 01:13:57,784
I told her it was a far fetched idea.

1104
01:13:58,646 --> 01:14:01,681
Yes, but you did manage to tell her
about the missing keys.

1105
01:14:01,776 --> 01:14:03,086
You never mentioned them to me.

1106
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:05,321
That wasn't among those...

1107
01:14:05,416 --> 01:14:08,003
...little details that was bothering
you so much.

1108
01:14:08,546 --> 01:14:10,303
Well, now, Mrs.Williams,

1109
01:14:10,622 --> 01:14:13,465
if by some remote chance your
stepdaughter had been right,

1110
01:14:13,816 --> 01:14:16,818
it wouldn't have been very smart for
me to have told you now would it?

1111
01:14:17,361 --> 01:14:18,447
I understand.

1112
01:14:19,501 --> 01:14:21,034
Good afternoon Mrs.Williams.

1113
01:14:25,665 --> 01:14:27,070
Lieutenant Columbo.

1114
01:14:30,327 --> 01:14:32,754
Thank you for straightening Margaret
out. I appreciate it.

1115
01:14:32,946 --> 01:14:34,352
Oh, it was the only thing I could do.

1116
01:14:35,150 --> 01:14:38,056
I mean I just can't have you accused
of murder on the wrong evidence.

1117
01:14:52,970 --> 01:14:56,195
I know you did it. I know it.

1118
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,676
I think you ought to see
a doctor Margaret.

1119
01:15:00,890 --> 01:15:01,881
Do you?

1120
01:15:02,551 --> 01:15:04,915
Yes I do. I think you're
a very sick girl.

1121
01:15:08,459 --> 01:15:09,769
Are you listening?

1122
01:15:10,248 --> 01:15:13,633
Yes, but it's very difficult
because I'm so sick.

1123
01:15:13,761 --> 01:15:18,711
Margaret why don't you go back
to Switzerland?

1124
01:15:19,989 --> 01:15:22,224
I'll put you up at a hotel
until school opens.

1125
01:15:23,597 --> 01:15:27,143
I'm staying right here.

1126
01:15:39,278 --> 01:15:40,619
You listen to me.

1127
01:15:40,971 --> 01:15:44,004
You stay here only as long as
you behave.

1128
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:47,581
One more little drama and I will not
only cut off your allowance,

1129
01:15:47,678 --> 01:15:49,370
I will tie up your estate.

1130
01:15:49,594 --> 01:15:52,851
You will be on social security
before you see a nickel of it.

1131
01:16:04,061 --> 01:16:06,201
Where will all your friends be then
Margaret?

1132
01:16:06,903 --> 01:16:09,043
When you haven't the money to buy
them anymore?

1133
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:31,814
<i>Mrs. Williams.</i>

1134
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:33,667
<i>This is Lieutenant Columbo.</i>

1135
01:16:33,762 --> 01:16:36,221
<i>Mrs. Williams, I was wondering
if I might drop by to see you.</i>

1136
01:16:36,317 --> 01:16:37,307
I've got something to show you,

1137
01:16:37,402 --> 01:16:39,255
I think you'll really appreciate it.

1138
01:16:40,852 --> 01:16:42,097
It's for you.

1139
01:16:42,736 --> 01:16:43,982
Some stunt huh?

1140
01:16:44,237 --> 01:16:45,611
You know, I remembered
how you liked gadgets,

1141
01:16:45,706 --> 01:16:47,335
I thought you'd get a kick out of it.

1142
01:16:47,654 --> 01:16:49,251
You know, something you could show
at parties.

1143
01:16:49,347 --> 01:16:51,774
Something to amuse your
friend with. Like that.

1144
01:16:51,998 --> 01:16:53,403
Would you like to tell me
how you did it.

1145
01:16:53,499 --> 01:16:54,681
Oh, there was nothing to it.

1146
01:16:54,776 --> 01:16:56,948
I got one of these special phones
of yours,

1147
01:16:57,044 --> 01:16:59,790
I got a tape machine and
I got a timer and I rigged it up...

1148
01:17:00,174 --> 01:17:01,643
And that was it.

1149
01:17:02,057 --> 01:17:04,038
I'm very busy Lieutenant.

1150
01:17:04,453 --> 01:17:07,040
Would you like to tell me what this has
to do with my husband's murder?

1151
01:17:07,296 --> 01:17:11,543
You see, I can't get anything past you.
You really got me pegged.

1152
01:17:11,926 --> 01:17:14,130
Well I'll tell you what it is.
It just shows that...

1153
01:17:14,641 --> 01:17:17,195
...your husband could have been
dead at the time of the phone call.

1154
01:17:17,355 --> 01:17:18,633
That his voice could've come from...

1155
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,900
...carefully edited tapes from
your office.

1156
01:17:22,465 --> 01:17:27,287
You know Columbo, you're almost
likeable in a shabby sort of way.

1157
01:17:27,863 --> 01:17:30,353
Maybe it's the way you
come slouching in here...

1158
01:17:30,449 --> 01:17:32,398
...with your shopworn bag of
tricks.

1159
01:17:33,483 --> 01:17:35,016
Me? Tricks?

1160
01:17:35,527 --> 01:17:39,711
The humility, the seeming
absentmindedness,

1161
01:17:39,807 --> 01:17:43,831
the homey anecdotes about the family,
the wife, you know?

1162
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:46,449
Really?

1163
01:17:46,545 --> 01:17:50,026
Yeah, Lieutenant Columbo,
fumbling and stumbling along.

1164
01:17:50,537 --> 01:17:53,124
But it's always the jugular
that he's after.

1165
01:17:53,763 --> 01:17:56,957
And I imagine that more often
than not he's successful.

1166
01:17:57,053 --> 01:17:59,160
I appreciate that compliment
Mrs.Williams.

1167
01:17:59,256 --> 01:18:01,396
And I particularly appreciate it
coming from you.

1168
01:18:01,492 --> 01:18:04,781
I must tell you, I'm disappointed
in you Lieutenant,

1169
01:18:04,877 --> 01:18:06,793
I'm really very disappointed.

1170
01:18:06,889 --> 01:18:07,528
How's that?

1171
01:18:07,623 --> 01:18:09,157
You've reduced yourself...

1172
01:18:09,252 --> 01:18:12,765
...from veiled threats and
insinuations to vaudeville.

1173
01:18:13,563 --> 01:18:16,597
Now what did you really expect
to achieve by this tasteless stunt?

1174
01:18:16,693 --> 01:18:19,855
Did you expect me to throw myself
at your feet confessing?

1175
01:18:20,047 --> 01:18:21,612
No. No, I didn't think you'd do that.

1176
01:18:21,708 --> 01:18:23,017
Well then what good did it do?

1177
01:18:23,337 --> 01:18:25,476
I just add it up with
all the other details.

1178
01:18:26,178 --> 01:18:28,925
And after a while you're able to see
what really might have happened.

1179
01:18:29,021 --> 01:18:32,087
Might have, could have, those aren't
phrases that hold up in court.

1180
01:18:32,342 --> 01:18:34,099
You'd be thrown out for lack
of evidence.

1181
01:18:34,641 --> 01:18:37,293
Yeah, but you know justice is
strange Counselor.

1182
01:18:37,867 --> 01:18:40,614
With some people it's not enough
just to be acquitted.

1183
01:18:40,934 --> 01:18:42,562
With some people it's also
necessary...

1184
01:18:42,657 --> 01:18:46,107
...to convince the public by
producing the guilty party as well.

1185
01:18:46,203 --> 01:18:48,854
I'm familiar with the Perry Mason
school of justice,

1186
01:18:48,950 --> 01:18:50,993
Lieutenant. It's not a bad tactic.

1187
01:18:51,313 --> 01:18:54,187
Threaten to ruin my reputation
by accusation.

1188
01:18:54,283 --> 01:18:55,912
Create a doubt about me.

1189
01:18:56,008 --> 01:18:57,157
But then, there's always the other side.

1190
01:18:57,253 --> 01:18:59,201
I could always show that
you were hounding me,

1191
01:18:59,393 --> 01:19:01,085
maliciously persecuting me.

1192
01:19:01,468 --> 01:19:03,800
You're playing a weak hand
Lieutenant.

1193
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:06,514
Either arrest me or get out of here.

1194
01:19:09,230 --> 01:19:10,922
I'm going to have to tell you
the truth.

1195
01:19:12,263 --> 01:19:13,892
The department took me off
the case.

1196
01:19:14,881 --> 01:19:17,948
There's just nothing concrete,
nothing to give to a DA.

1197
01:19:18,651 --> 01:19:21,014
There's a murder out in Malibu
they want me to look into.

1198
01:19:21,908 --> 01:19:24,367
And you couldn't bear to leave
without saying goodbye huh?

1199
01:19:24,974 --> 01:19:27,082
That's right. That's right.

1200
01:19:35,385 --> 01:19:37,461
After all that, I almost
forgot to say it.

1201
01:19:38,387 --> 01:19:39,537
Goodbye Mrs.Williams.

1202
01:19:41,230 --> 01:19:42,635
Goodbye Lieutenant.

1203
01:20:28,975 --> 01:20:29,741
Hello.

1204
01:20:31,913 --> 01:20:33,478
How do you like it Leslie?

1205
01:20:34,116 --> 01:20:37,502
Just giving you the same kind of
welcome home you gave my father.

1206
01:20:50,724 --> 01:20:52,160
Stop Leslie.

1207
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:06,500
The first one was a blank.
But who knows.

1208
01:21:07,682 --> 01:21:09,790
The next one may be the real
thing.

1209
01:21:14,867 --> 01:21:17,039
Margaret, just let me go by. Just...

1210
01:21:24,001 --> 01:21:26,429
There's nothing in that gun.

1211
01:21:28,888 --> 01:21:29,814
There's nothing.

1212
01:21:31,635 --> 01:21:33,647
- Nothing in that gun!
- Margaret!

1213
01:21:49,997 --> 01:21:51,818
<i>My father was never kidnapped.</i>

1214
01:21:52,042 --> 01:21:53,925
<i>He came home that night
and you killed him!</i>

1215
01:21:54,118 --> 01:21:57,439
<i>I know you did it.
I know it. I know it.</i>

1216
01:22:06,477 --> 01:22:07,882
Margaret!

1217
01:22:30,844 --> 01:22:32,186
Is that what you want?

1218
01:22:32,282 --> 01:22:34,869
Out! Out! I want you out of
this house tonight!

1219
01:22:37,711 --> 01:22:40,489
Even if you throw me out Leslie,
I won't stop.

1220
01:22:40,618 --> 01:22:43,108
I'll hound you, humiliate you,
embarrass you.

1221
01:22:43,204 --> 01:22:44,353
Get packed!

1222
01:22:51,508 --> 01:22:55,148
You used all of my trust account
to pay the ransom.

1223
01:22:55,499 --> 01:22:58,246
And now you think you can get away
with my share of the estate too?

1224
01:22:59,013 --> 01:23:02,813
You're not going to get away with it.
I want what's mine.

1225
01:23:08,721 --> 01:23:10,733
You want to negotiate, don't you?

1226
01:23:11,084 --> 01:23:12,905
I just want what's coming to me.

1227
01:23:24,690 --> 01:23:26,798
I'll give you 20,000 a year for
5 years.

1228
01:23:26,893 --> 01:23:28,394
That will take you into
your trust.

1229
01:23:32,258 --> 01:23:34,558
My trust account was for 25 a year.

1230
01:23:35,132 --> 01:23:37,081
Plus a bonus of 5,000.

1231
01:23:37,592 --> 01:23:38,773
All in cash.

1232
01:23:41,872 --> 01:23:43,852
You are some little girl.

1233
01:23:47,236 --> 01:23:50,559
All right. If you're on the
plane tomorrow.

1234
01:23:51,964 --> 01:23:55,317
Excuse me. I have a lot of
packing to do.

1235
01:24:23,165 --> 01:24:26,135
When you arrive at Zurich,
Mr. Steiner will meet you at the airport.

1236
01:24:26,231 --> 01:24:28,212
He'll take you to the bank
and open an account for you.

1237
01:24:33,258 --> 01:24:34,343
Goodbye Margaret.

1238
01:24:35,844 --> 01:24:37,026
Goodbye Leslie.

1239
01:25:02,416 --> 01:25:03,788
Lieutenant Columbo.

1240
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:07,174
Mrs.Williams.

1241
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:09,123
Pursuing or extraditing?

1242
01:25:09,921 --> 01:25:12,699
No. Just waiting.

1243
01:25:13,051 --> 01:25:15,381
You seem depressed.
Did a criminal get away?

1244
01:25:17,266 --> 01:25:20,109
Come on, I'll buy you a drink
for consolation.

1245
01:25:20,204 --> 01:25:22,152
I hate to see you unhappy.

1246
01:25:23,590 --> 01:25:24,995
You know, that's very nice of you.

1247
01:25:25,186 --> 01:25:27,007
I have a heart. I do.

1248
01:25:46,584 --> 01:25:48,596
- Yes.
- What will you have Lieutenant?

1249
01:25:49,490 --> 01:25:50,224
After you.

1250
01:25:50,544 --> 01:25:51,310
Sherry.

1251
01:25:51,853 --> 01:25:53,131
I'll have a root beer.

1252
01:25:53,514 --> 01:25:54,759
A root beer?

1253
01:25:56,803 --> 01:25:59,454
Lieutenant you always manage
to make me feel decadent.

1254
01:25:59,549 --> 01:26:01,658
I do? Gee, I never knew that.

1255
01:26:01,754 --> 01:26:04,213
I'm sorry... It's nothing personal,
you understand that.

1256
01:26:04,308 --> 01:26:05,682
I understand.

1257
01:26:06,767 --> 01:26:08,652
I'm going to miss you Lieutenant.

1258
01:26:09,195 --> 01:26:12,069
You and all your fascinating
little details.

1259
01:26:12,516 --> 01:26:13,729
You know, you're something.

1260
01:26:15,614 --> 01:26:17,530
You really are something.

1261
01:26:18,105 --> 01:26:19,734
I'm going to try and take that
as a compliment.

1262
01:26:19,989 --> 01:26:20,916
Oh, it is.

1263
01:26:21,075 --> 01:26:21,969
Is it?

1264
01:26:22,065 --> 01:26:23,055
Believe me.

1265
01:26:28,645 --> 01:26:29,506
To you.

1266
01:26:33,338 --> 01:26:35,096
Here's looking at you, Mrs.Williams.

1267
01:26:40,493 --> 01:26:44,133
You know, for a while there
I thought I'll never get her.

1268
01:26:45,187 --> 01:26:47,263
All those little details,
they just didn't make it.

1269
01:26:47,359 --> 01:26:49,116
There was nothing conclusive.

1270
01:26:49,563 --> 01:26:52,405
And then I thought,
it's gotta be the money.

1271
01:26:52,852 --> 01:26:53,714
What money?

1272
01:26:53,810 --> 01:26:55,152
The ransom money.

1273
01:26:55,343 --> 01:26:57,834
When a person engineers
a false kidnapping,

1274
01:26:57,930 --> 01:27:00,038
they have to have the money
hidden somewhere.

1275
01:27:00,485 --> 01:27:03,870
Now it cleaned you out to raise
the ransom. So I thought...

1276
01:27:04,733 --> 01:27:08,661
...I gotta find a way to force
her to use the ransom money.

1277
01:27:09,395 --> 01:27:10,737
Thank you very much.

1278
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,717
You know and it seemed like
a nutty idea to everybody,

1279
01:27:12,813 --> 01:27:13,962
I know it did to my wife.

1280
01:27:14,058 --> 01:27:16,197
But I believed in it because...

1281
01:27:17,795 --> 01:27:21,371
...Mrs.Williams, you have no
conscience.

1282
01:27:21,818 --> 01:27:23,543
And that's your weakness.

1283
01:27:23,862 --> 01:27:27,950
Did it ever occur to you that there are
very few people that would take money...

1284
01:27:28,110 --> 01:27:29,515
...to forget about a murder?

1285
01:27:30,154 --> 01:27:32,293
It didn't, did it. I knew it wouldn't.

1286
01:27:33,188 --> 01:27:36,158
No conscience.
Limits your imagination.

1287
01:27:37,084 --> 01:27:40,756
You can't conceive of anybody being
any different than what you are.

1288
01:27:41,587 --> 01:27:42,673
And you're greedy.

1289
01:27:44,174 --> 01:27:46,697
And that's why, as bright as you are,

1290
01:27:47,016 --> 01:27:51,455
and you're bright... you believed
that Margaret could be bought.

1291
01:27:55,065 --> 01:27:57,012
Get to the point. Come on.
Get to the point.

1292
01:27:57,108 --> 01:28:00,015
Well, here's the point Mrs.Williams.
You see.

1293
01:28:04,135 --> 01:28:07,616
You were set up.
I arranged it all with Margaret.

1294
01:28:09,563 --> 01:28:11,927
I told Margaret that
if she really wanted to nail you,

1295
01:28:12,470 --> 01:28:14,769
she had to force you
to use the ransom money.

1296
01:28:23,967 --> 01:28:25,947
You're very lucky Lieutenant.

1297
01:28:33,516 --> 01:28:34,347
No.

1298
01:28:35,912 --> 01:28:37,988
Congratulations. You're very smart.

1299
01:28:39,137 --> 01:28:40,255
So are you.

1300
01:28:40,669 --> 01:28:41,692
Thank you.

1301
01:28:44,310 --> 01:28:46,067
Forgive the charade
about the briefcase.

1302
01:28:46,163 --> 01:28:47,823
But we had to make sure
that the money was in there...

1303
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:50,379
...before we arrested you.
I had no alternative.

1304
01:28:51,624 --> 01:28:53,125
Would you like to finish your sherry?

1305
01:28:53,220 --> 01:28:54,658
I don't think I want it any more.

1306
01:28:56,990 --> 01:28:59,736
Would you advise Mrs. Williams of her
rights and drive her downtown?

1307
01:29:25,286 --> 01:29:27,074
That'll be a dollar 10 please.

1308
01:29:27,616 --> 01:29:28,574
Oh yeah...

1309
01:29:31,034 --> 01:29:32,662
Be with you in one minute.

1310
01:29:38,795 --> 01:29:40,966
Would you mind if I signed for this?

1311
01:29:41,765 --> 01:29:44,128
I'm from the police
Lieutenant Columbo.

1312
01:29:44,255 --> 01:29:45,660
I guess that'll be all right.

1313
01:29:54,827 --> 01:29:56,487
Oh, thank you very much.
