1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,593
Look around you.

2
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,752
Look around you.

3
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,989
Just look around you.

4
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,831
Have you worked out
what we're looking for?

5
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,150
Correct. The answer is...

6
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,552
This programme, "Germs",

7
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,315
is discussed in chapter 622
of your textbook,

8
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,040
which accompanies this series.

9
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,758
Please ensure that you have
your copybook at hand,

10
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,230
as you'll be asked to take down
notes from the screen

11
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,279
at various points
throughout the programme.

12
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,714
Germs.

13
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,914
Germs, germs, germs.

14
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,831
Everywhere, germs.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,593
Dirty...

16
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,877
filthy...

17
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,713
germs.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,992
But where do they come from?

19
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,510
Germs originated in Germany,

20
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,957
before rapidly spreading
throughout the rest of the world.

21
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,555
They're basically a form
of malevolent bacteria,

22
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,633
with one purpose, to spread germs.

23
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,712
An experiment was carried out

24
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,430
to illustrate just how fast
germs can multiply.

25
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,795
First, a solution rich in germs is
collected in a Bakerloo bell jar.

26
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,034
We're using some filthy drain water
from an overflowing sewer.

27
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,512
Next, several drops
of the germ-ridden solution

28
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,991
are removed
from the Bakerloo via a pipette.

29
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,832
This pipette is then
taken over to our subject.

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,037
This is Ashley Swain,

31
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,830
a first-year chemistry student
at the University of St Christmas.

32
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,472
Ashley's tongue is cupped,

33
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,474
and the scientist releases
a few drops of liquid sewage

34
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,472
into his mouth.

35
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,915
We're going to see how fast
the germs can spread

36
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,993
from inside Ashley's mouth
to this man,

37
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,435
Ashley's tutor at the faculty,
Professor Clifford Miles.

38
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,079
Now we take
the professor's temperature.

39
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,711
It's normal. 98.4 degrees.

40
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,520
Note that down in your copybook.

41
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,556
The scientist now instructs Ashley

42
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,514
to cough in the direction
of Professor Miles.

43
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,960
The germs have hit their target.
The Professor.

44
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,474
Let's see how fast
the germs get to work.

45
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,997
Get ready to take down
readings from the screen.

46
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,192
Let's see
if there's been any change

47
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,511
in the Professor's temperature.

48
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,555
It's gone up a little: 101 degrees.

49
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,759
Two hours have passed,

50
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,311
and the Professor's showing
signs of deterioration.

51
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,870
Let's check his temperature again.

52
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,515
It's now 103.8 degrees.

53
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,550
After three hours the Professor
is clearly highly feverish.

54
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,034
He's rambling and is obviously
in a great deal of discomfort.

55
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,395
And it's hardly surprising, as his
temperature is 107.2 degrees.

56
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,632
107.2. Write that down.

57
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,079
As we can see, in just a few hours,
Professor Clifford Miles' body

58
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,120
has become completely riddled
with the germs from inside Ashley.

59
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,232
Do get well soon, Professor.

60
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,838
You can pick up germs
from a variety of sources,

61
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,880
and because they're invisible,
they're almost impossible to see.

62
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,077
You can get them from nasty places.

63
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,880
For example, if you haven't
washed your hands properly

64
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,470
after wiping your bottom.

65
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,392
Sharing a friend's recorder.

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,151
Kissing a dog.

67
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,596
Or a tramp.

68
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,354
In the laboratory,
we can cultivate germs

69
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,712
in order to study
their behaviour in detail.

70
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,832
An experiment was carried out

71
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,475
to cultivate
the Milenius mytoteme germ.

72
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,674
The Milenius mytoteme germ

73
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,912
is unique
to one specific branch of moth,

74
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,596
the Brown Maiden,
seen here in our gribbin.

75
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,677
The Brown Maiden is normally found
in shrubland and thickets,

76
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,231
and feasts on tiny grubs
and leaves.

77
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,717
It's a different sort of moth
to one you'd enjoy in a sandwich.

78
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,954
They have a rather bitter taste,
but are ideal for our experiment.

79
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,311
A lamp is turned on, and the Brown
Maiden begins its futile flight.

80
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,597
As it flaps its tiny wings,

81
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,998
they brush up against
the inner walls of the gribbin.

82
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,038
The wings are rich in mytoteme,

83
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,960
and soon the walls
are coated in the germ.

84
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,070
The moth is now free to stay...

85
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,630
or go.

86
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,632
Next, a cotton bud is used

87
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,470
to scrape off germ samples
from inside the gribbin.

88
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,358
These are then wiped
in a petri dish containing agar.

89
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,317
The germs are now left
to grow overnight.

90
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,393
The next morning,
we can examine the results.

91
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,836
Have your pen and paper ready.

92
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,592
A strange reaction has occurred
in the middle of the petri

93
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,156
in the middle of the night.

94
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,193
The mytoteme germs
have multiplied so fast

95
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,876
that they have bonded
to form a plant-like organism.

96
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,754
Note the little leaves at the peak.

97
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,554
And underneath, tiny apples.

98
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,035
This is a fruit-bearing bush.

99
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,274
It's called Lepidopterus arboratus,
or moth-apple tree.

100
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,036
Moth apples are smaller
than crab apples. Sweeter, too.

101
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,359
But don' t be tempted to eat them
because they're highly explosive.

102
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,597
Now hand in your copybook
to your teacher or head of class.

103
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,949
In the next programme,
we will look at hitchhiking.

104
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,872
