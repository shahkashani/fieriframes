1
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:49,341
400 years after the last king
was driven from the city,

2
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,208
the republic of Rome
rules many nations,

3
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,440
but cannot rule itself.

4
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:58,008
The city is constantly
roiled by conflict

5
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:01,452
between the common people
and the nobility.

6
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:05,015
Power is shared
and order maintained

7
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:07,322
by two soldiers...
old friends...

8
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,729
Gnaeus Pompey Magnus
and Gaius Julius Caesar.

9
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:15,860
Once, Pompey was acknowledged
by all to be the greater man,

10
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:20,100
but for the last eight years, while Pompey
has kept the peace in Rome,

11
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,268
Caesar has waged a war
of conquest in Gaul

12
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:26,244
that has made him
ever more rich and popular.

13
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:28,543
The balance
of power is shifting,

14
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:31,141
and the nobility
have grown fearful.

15
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,152
Though of noble blood
himself,

16
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,882
Caesar stands
with the common people.

17
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:40,154
A man like that... an aristocrat
with soldiers, money

18
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:43,993
and the love of the people...
might make himself king.

19
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,992
Pullo, formation!

20
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:50,655
Pullo!

21
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,756
Single formation!

22
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:57,635
Shields on me!

23
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,982
Get back in formation,
you drunken fool.

24
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,164
Reform!

25
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:31,159
Legionary Titus Pullo
is a hero of the 13th legion,

26
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,502
but look at him now.

27
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,736
Justice knows
every man's number.

28
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,711
He has committed
a terrible sacrilege,

29
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:42,715
and he will pay for it
with his life!

30
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:47,277
As will any man here
who breaks the law.

31
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,687
Brawlers and drunkards
will be flogged.

32
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:53,886
Thieves will be strangled.

33
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:58,386
Deserters
will be crucified.

34
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,734
Is that it?

35
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:10,140
I was just beginning
to enjoy myself.

36
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,548
Before you...

37
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:28,992
Vercingetorix,
son of Celtil,

38
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,861
chieftain of the tribe
of the Arverni,

39
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:35,493
commander of the rebel
stronghold of Elysia,

40
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:37,730
king of all the Gauls.

41
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,897
What would you
have of him?

42
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:02,258
Caesar!

43
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,092
Caesar!

44
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,620
Caesar!

45
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:09,931
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

46
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,410
Hey!

47
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:32,253
Hey, what's going on?

48
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,851
Hey... here!

49
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:39,590
You piss-drinking
sons of circus whores!

50
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:42,567
The chief of the Gauls
has surrendered to Caesar.

51
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,399
The war is over.

52
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:48,330
Don't say that.

53
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,274
The boys have been given
two days liberty

54
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,971
to sack the town
and take personal spoils.

55
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:55,537
They'll all be rich.

56
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,640
And me in here!

57
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,310
Hey!

58
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,984
Come on, get in there!

59
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:09,492
400 denarii?
Are you insane?

60
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,156
That's a floor price.

61
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:15,190
We'll pay the usual premium for
tradesmen and fertile women, et cetera.

62
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:17,892
From Pompey Magnus, sir.

63
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:21,100
Set the floor
closer to eight.

64
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:28,506
"My dear friend
and partner, Gaius,

65
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,277
I have terrible news".

66
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:33,149
Forgive me.

67
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,154
Forgive me.

68
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:38,487
I forgive you.
I forgive you.

69
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,860
- Be good to my eggs.
- I will.

70
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,795
And to my father.

71
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,458
I will.

72
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,797
Kiss me.

73
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,509
Your hair.

74
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,049
Funny.

75
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:29,307
This isn't miserable
Eastern peasantry.

76
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,469
This is the creme
of the Gallic nations.

77
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,002
A glut on the market.
You won't be able to give them away.

78
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:36,514
- Seven, and be done with it.
- On delivery to Masilia?

79
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:39,643
- Oh, please!
- Agreed. See to the details.

80
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,986
I hope you got a decent
price off those parasites.

81
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,728
Good enough.

82
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,530
News from Rome?

83
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,337
Pompey writes.

84
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,569
My daughter Julia
has died in childbirth.

85
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,049
I grieve with you.

86
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,087
The child?

87
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,564
A girl... stillborn.

88
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,536
Pompey will be needing
a new wife.

89
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:45,747
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

90
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:54,253
More of Caesar's spoils
from Gaul.

91
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,761
Caesar! Caesar!

92
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,520
What a dreadful noise
plebs make when they're happy.

93
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,861
This is music.

94
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:36,857
Wait until Caesar starts them
howling for our blood.

95
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:39,234
Then you'll hear
something dreadful.

96
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,819
A fine reward is offered

97
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,880
for the return
of an egg,

98
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,484
stolen or absconded

99
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,463
from the house
of Marius Dolabella.

100
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:41,762
Under the protection
of Pompey Magnus

101
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:45,703
and Julius Caesar,
Senate sits tomorrow.

102
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:47,569
Be aware!

103
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:50,370
No disorder
will be tolerated.

104
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:35,109
That was lovely, Timon.

105
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,315
Two stallions
have come to Rome today.

106
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,788
Of course,

107
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,920
how childish of me.

108
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:47,091
- You want the horse.
- I do.

109
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,930
But don't
be sullen now.

110
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,697
This was not
a hardship for me.

111
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:53,398
I've always found something
perversely erotic

112
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,634
about goaty little men.

113
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,977
Do please don't lurk,
Octavian. Come in.

114
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,419
Don't be a goose.
Come in.

115
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,198
I've bought a horse.

116
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,106
Have you?

117
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,806
The best horse in Rome
by all accounts.

118
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,712
I'm very happy
for you.

119
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,512
It's a gift
for your great-uncle.

120
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:41,019
I want you to take
the animal to Gaul

121
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,146
and give it
to him in person.

122
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:46,650
- Why?
- Well, when he's back in Rome,

123
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:49,923
everyone will be giving him gifts.
We must be first.

124
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:52,123
I doubt he will return
to Rome anytime soon.

125
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,927
The Senate's hostility
will prevent him.

126
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:57,197
- Legally speaking, it is not...
- Please don't start speaking legally.

127
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,932
- You know how it bores me.
- It's a long way to Gaul.

128
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:02,440
Exactly.
While yet a mere boy,

129
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:05,443
you would risk your life to honor
your beloved great-uncle.

130
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:09,345
You ride into Caesar's camp
alone, on a noble white stallion.

131
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,281
That's a gift
he won't soon forget.

132
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,615
- Alone?
- Well, you'll have plenty of eggs.

133
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:15,381
You'll be perfectly safe.

134
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,513
And you'll make your mamma
very proud and happy.

135
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:31,227
Cato,
the Senate hears you.

136
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,864
Pompey Magnus...

137
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:37,307
I have a question concerning
your friend and co-consul...

138
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:41,245
the darling of Venus,
Gaius Julius Caesar.

139
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,510
Why does his chair
remain empty?

140
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,814
Why does he not come home?
His illegal war is over.

141
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,612
Gaul is long since
on it's knees.

142
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,454
Why does Caesar
keep his brave soldiers

143
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:57,894
from their families
and friends?

144
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,098
For eight long years,

145
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:05,262
he has gorged himself
like a wolf

146
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:07,238
on the blood of Gaul,

147
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:10,401
and thereby made himself
monstrously rich.

148
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,501
- Why?
- Sit down!

149
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:16,844
Why does he ply the mob with races
and fights and gaudy feasts?

150
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:19,316
Why has he paid the debts

151
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:23,947
of every reprobate fool
in this Senate house?

152
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,752
Why?!

153
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:31,423
I'll tell you why
he does these things.

154
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,397
He wants to buy himself
a crown.

155
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,465
He wants to destroy
the Republic

156
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:39,767
and rule Rome
as a bloody tyrant!

157
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:41,932
That's why!

158
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:49,303
Therefore, I move...

159
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:53,512
that Caesar's governorship
in Gaul be terminated immediately,

160
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,679
that his armies
be disbanded

161
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,621
and that he be recalled
to Rome to answer charges

162
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,647
of illegal warfare,

163
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:02,923
theft, bribery
and treason!

164
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,733
Very good, Cato.

165
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:19,437
Full of vim and verve,
as usual.

166
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,969
Caesar...

167
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:24,244
has been generous
to the people

168
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:27,775
because he loves
the people as I do.

169
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:33,916
It is the people that rule,
not you fine nobleman.

170
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,291
It is Pompey's soldiers
that rule,

171
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,262
not we fine nobleman.

172
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:42,427
I'm going to save us all
hours of useless clamor

173
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:45,631
and use my consular veto
on your motion.

174
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,231
- Yes!
- I do not...

175
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:51,367
- I do not...
- Silence!

176
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:56,808
Are we children?
Let the consul speak.

177
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,407
Thank you, Cicero.

178
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,350
- I do not...
- However...

179
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:03,048
if I might say a few words
before you continue.

180
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,989
When confronted
by a hungry wolf,

181
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,462
it is unwise
to goad the beast,

182
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,658
as Cato would have us do.

183
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,294
But it is equally unwise

184
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,566
to imagine
the snarling animal

185
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:22,199
a friend
and offer your hand

186
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,765
as Pompey does.

187
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:26,209
Perhaps you would
have us climb a tree.

188
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,711
Caesar is my brother
by sacred oath.

189
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:38,280
I know his heart.
He is my friend

190
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,951
and a faithful
son of the Republic.

191
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,587
And until anyone proves
that he is not,

192
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,221
I will never betray him.

193
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:14,049
Pompey Magnus, my dear fellow,
you're well met.

194
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,061
Scipio, Cato.

195
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,757
I would not take you
for lovers of the mime.

196
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:21,925
You know my daughter,
Cornelia.

197
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:25,403
Widow of noble Publius
who died at Carrhae.

198
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:29,271
Cornelia, your husband
was a fine Roman.

199
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,798
I thank you.

200
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,979
Father, my presence
is not appropriate.

201
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:37,641
There's a lewd woman
on the stage.

202
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,344
I had no notion.

203
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:41,943
We will not
linger then.

204
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:45,047
Pompey,
a pleasant good night.

205
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,226
If it please you,
might we speak alone?

206
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,831
Neither
we aristocrats alone

207
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,304
nor you and your soldiers
alone can crush Caesar.

208
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,966
Stop there.

209
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,168
I do not say that
you wish to crush Caesar,

210
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,973
I only say that if you did wish
it, you could not do it alone.

211
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:10,504
I have no need
of you noble gentleman.

212
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,517
I have only
to stamp my feet

213
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,179
and legions will spring up
all over Italy!

214
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,155
I can squash Caesar
like an insect

215
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,181
if I wished it so.

216
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,056
I do not wish it.

217
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25,029
Renounce him, Pompey!

218
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:26,758
Renounce Caesar!

219
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,393
Ally yourself with us and his strength
will wither away.

220
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:32,733
It is you who is
the real power.

221
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:35,569
It is you
the people truly love.

222
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:38,098
Think you they will
still shout Caesar's name

223
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:40,634
when he runs out of Gallic
trinkets to throw to them?

224
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,012
Think you I care what names
are shouted in the streets?

225
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:47,280
Nothing is
more important.

226
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:53,150
You ask me
to openly betray a friend.

227
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,092
I cannot do it.

228
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,719
Good night.

229
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:27,719
Oh, silly
baby brother.

230
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,425
Everything
will be all right.

231
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:42,635
Is he not perfect?
Proper little soldier.

232
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:44,642
- He's scared.
- Nonsense.

233
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:46,371
Roman men
are never scared.

234
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,901
He's just sad
to be leaving his mamma.

235
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:50,176
You're not scared,
are you, Octavian?

236
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:52,410
Of course you're not.
Time flies.

237
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,919
Give me a kiss,
my love.

238
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:00,283
Andros...

239
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,452
bring him back safe
or I'll use the eyes

240
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:04,758
of your children
for beads.

241
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:33,990
Lyco, the horse...
not too expensive I hope.

242
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:37,120
I'm sorry, sir,
the horse was sold already.

243
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,596
- To Atia of the Julii.
- Atia?

244
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,656
She's sending it to Gaul...

245
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,634
a gift for Caesar.

246
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,706
Damn him!

247
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:53,836
Must he have everything?

248
00:21:57,015 --> 00:22:00,007
As you were going
to be in Gaul anyway,

249
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:03,920
I might kill
two birds with one stone.

250
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,579
Let me look at you.

251
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,383
As ugly as ever,
I'm afraid.

252
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,652
Not at all.
Age suits you, Brutus.

253
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,419
How long has it been?

254
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:50,223
- Five years?
- No, six.

255
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,423
Oh, how clever.

256
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:54,591
It's almost like
a proper house.

257
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,860
Oh...

258
00:23:57,903 --> 00:24:00,428
I deeply regret
your loss.

259
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:04,567
Julia and so forth.
Horrible business.

260
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,474
Condolences, really.

261
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,939
Now tell me,
how's your mother?

262
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,917
The same as ever.

263
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,920
She sends her love,
demands to know

264
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,945
why you haven't
written to her in months.

265
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:20,549
I can remedy that
if you'll be my courier.

266
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:23,425
I have several letters
to send.

267
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,124
If I can ever bring myself
to get on another horse.

268
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:28,462
I had no conception
that Gaul was so far away.

269
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,525
Brutus,
me old cock...

270
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,503
what on earth
are you doing here?

271
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:34,402
Mark Antony,
how nice.

272
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:36,600
I've been visiting
my cousin in Narbo.

273
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,768
Oh? How is that idiot
cousin of yours?

274
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,711
- He was...
- Actually, I'm in a bit of a rush.

275
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:44,374
I need, say,
a half talent of gold.

276
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:47,749
- Do you?
- See how he trusts me.

277
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:50,812
- For the eagle.
- Of course. Strabo!

278
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,082
Give his honor Mark Antony
a half talent of gold.

279
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:58,391
- A half talent of gold.
- And not a penny more.

280
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,364
Dominus.

281
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,797
I don't know how
you tolerate that man.

282
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,863
He likes to fight.

283
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:11,876
The way he carries on, one might think
he came from no family at all.

284
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,674
He does have a vulgarian streak.
I don't mind it.

285
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:17,939
What is this about
the eagle?

286
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:25,853
My personal standard
was stolen by brigands.

287
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:27,518
A bad business.

288
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:30,585
The legions were already homesick
and surly when the eagle was taken,

289
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:32,597
now they're
positively mutinous.

290
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,963
The men think it's
a sure sign of my doom,

291
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,026
and they're clamoring
like geese for disbandment.

292
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:40,970
They did not seem
so unhappy.

293
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:44,373
Well, they never flaunt their discontent.
Gets them whipped.

294
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:46,673
I tell you, Brutus,

295
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,372
I'm at my wits end.

296
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:08,123
Master Octavian...

297
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:11,428
Vasio is only
a few more miles.

298
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:13,767
Do not touch me
without permission.

299
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:16,736
Water.

300
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,178
Lucius Vorenus.

301
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:02,983
You have a brain.

302
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:07,689
So the tribunes say.

303
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:11,355
So tell me, if it were you
who had to retrieve Caesar's eagle,

304
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:13,091
how would you go about it?

305
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:17,932
Uh, I'd take captives
from every tribe in Gaul

306
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,596
and crucify them
one by one

307
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,936
until someone tells me
where the eagle is.

308
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,908
Then, I would go in quick
and quiet with one or two men

309
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:27,138
and... steal it back.

310
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:29,976
Good.
We are of one mind.

311
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,006
- Do it.
- Do it, sir?

312
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,177
Well, I believe there's a torture
detachment with the third,

313
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:37,211
but you may choose
your own men if you wish.

314
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:47,661
There's a quarter talent
there, for bribes and such.

315
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:50,827
- Spend it wisely.
- Sir.

316
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:06,848
No! Please let me down!

317
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:09,718
Let me down!

318
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:16,252
Let me down! I know...
I know where the eagle is.

319
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:18,694
- Speak.
- The Blue Spaniards,

320
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:21,494
they came to stay
for one night...

321
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,229
and then rode
to the Cadurci lands.

322
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:27,261
Please! Please please.
Let me down.

323
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:30,035
Cadurci.

324
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:32,805
Fortune pisses on me.

325
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:35,438
- Please let me down!
- Take them down.

326
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,013
Forculus,

327
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,680
if you be the right god
for the business here,

328
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,349
I call on you
to help me.

329
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,449
If you will open
this door,

330
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:49,426
then I will kill for you
a fine white lamb,

331
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:52,953
or, failing that, if I couldn't get
a good one at a decent price,

332
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:54,760
then six pigeons.

333
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,824
This, Forculus,
I vow to you.

334
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:59,132
Legionary Titus Pullo,
stand up.

335
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,637
- What's he doing here?
- You are to be released

336
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:12,582
to the command of Second Spear
Centurion Lucius Vorenus.

337
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:15,780
Do your duty to his satisfaction, and
you'll be spared damnation in the arena.

338
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,311
I won't even stand next to
this short-assed shit,

339
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:20,688
leave alone serve under him.
I'll stay here, thanks very much.

340
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:23,421
These orders come direct from
his Excellency Mark Antony himself.

341
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:25,691
You are to retrieve
Caesar's eagle.

342
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:30,156
Me, retrieve
Caesar's eagle?

343
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:41,739
- Brutus?
- Mamma!

344
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:48,953
You can't imagine
how good it is to be home.

345
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,579
You're as brown
as a bean.

346
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,352
It makes me look
quite soldierly though.

347
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:55,951
It does, it does.

348
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:59,259
- How is cousin Marcellus?
- Tedious but healthy.

349
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,992
- And Caesar?
- Who?

350
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:02,863
Don't be cruel.

351
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,926
Is he well?
Did he ask of me?

352
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,904
Did he?
I can't recall.

353
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:09,566
I think not.

354
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:11,700
He did write you
a letter though.

355
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,973
Oh, you beast.

356
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:17,379
"Dearest Servilia,
forgive my long silence.

357
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:20,851
These last long months were
all blood and iron and mud,

358
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:23,115
and no time
for letters to friends.

359
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:26,487
Be sure that I have been thinking
of you with great affection.

360
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:29,789
I long to be together
and alone with you".

361
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:36,390
"Great affection".

362
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:38,459
Longs to be alone
with you.

363
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:41,734
You think he says
such things to his wife?

364
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,367
"Affection"?
What's that?

365
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:47,003
He could not say "love".

366
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:50,105
Would you have him
pluck a harp?

367
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:51,775
He's a soldier,
not a poet.

368
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:53,647
The day dwindles.

369
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,710
Our guests
will be arriving.

370
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:13,602
You ride well,
almost as well as me.

371
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,503
Pullo, you will
address me correctly.

372
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,770
Almost as well
as me, sir.

373
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,642
Me, I'm a natural.
My father was a Ubian probably.

374
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:22,703
Where did you learn
to ride so nice?

375
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:27,946
Please yourself.
Only trying to be pleasant.

376
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:30,784
My mother's people
raised horses in Mutina.

377
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:33,017
Mutina, near Reggium?
Up round there?

378
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,958
- Up there.
- Good country.

379
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:40,295
Listen, sir, thank you,
for taking me on this job.

380
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:43,357
- A noble way to make amends.
- Amends?

381
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,369
For getting me into
this cac by calling me names.

382
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:48,167
- Think nothing of it.
- Never. I won't forget.

383
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:50,766
Titus Pullo
never forgets a favor.

384
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:52,503
- Hah!
- What you mean, "Hah"?

385
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:55,637
What do you think our
chances are of finding the eagle?

386
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,477
13th never fails, eh?

387
00:31:57,515 --> 00:32:00,279
Little or no chance.
The eagle might be anywhere.

388
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:03,219
Buried, melted down,
sunk to bottom of the sea.

389
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,415
We are hunting a black dog
in the night.

390
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:07,822
And not finding the eagle
is much the same as losing it.

391
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,793
We will be disgraced.
Now, I chose you

392
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:12,660
because you are disgraced
already and condemned to die.

393
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,221
So you weren't making amends
at all, then?

394
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,860
Pullo, in effect,
you're dead already.

395
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:21,565
The loss of one drunken fool does
little damage to the legion.

396
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,369
If I'm dead
already then, sir,

397
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,433
you should take care
how you speak to me.

398
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:27,239
If I've got
nothing to lose,

399
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,872
what's to stop me
cutting you into little gobs

400
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:32,212
and riding off, eh?

401
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,979
What's to stop me, sir?

402
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:36,987
Well, if your honor as a soldier
of the 13th isn't enough,

403
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:39,581
then I'll have to rely on
my superior fighting skills.

404
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,320
- Superior fighting skills?
- Mmm.

405
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,850
Very good.

406
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,593
And of course, you have to
imagine long hair down to here,

407
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,329
huge moustaches,
the most horrific stench.

408
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,337
They eat only raw meat
and never wash.

409
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:55,965
Oh, they do have
one admirable custom.

410
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:57,838
They settle
their political disputes

411
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:00,673
by single combat
to the death.

412
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,476
- Excellent idea.
- Isn't it?

413
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:06,483
Mother is always nagging me
to attend politics.

414
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:08,883
Well, it's been
our family's tradition

415
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,751
and duty for...

416
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:12,278
500 years.

417
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,223
It is such
dreadfully dull stuff.

418
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:17,091
Now you see, if our Senate conducted
business in the German style,

419
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:18,755
I should
certainly go and watch.

420
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,889
Yeah, no tedious lawsuits
and endless debates,

421
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:23,162
just swords, daggers...

422
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:25,431
- much more entertaining.
- Brutus, a word.

423
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:32,038
Tell me,
you are a good judge.

424
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:35,876
How is my dear friend
Caesar?

425
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:38,279
Well, he is...

426
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:39,977
he's been better,
I think.

427
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,508
- Mmm?
- Mmm.

428
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:44,612
Very... very weary,
to be honest.

429
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:47,021
- A little demoralized.
- Caesar demoralized?

430
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:49,049
- Never.
- His standard was stolen.

431
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:51,084
How did he let a foolish thing
like that happen?

432
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:54,257
I don't know, but his manner
and uproar about it...

433
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:57,233
you know how plebeians
can be about such things...

434
00:33:57,268 --> 00:33:59,634
desperate to come home,
mutinous.

435
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:03,003
I have heard
there was some discontent,

436
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,441
but mutinous?
Hard to believe.

437
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:07,410
Can you imagine?

438
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:09,913
After all he has done
for them,

439
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:12,040
he is not sure whether
they will...

440
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:13,983
will fight
for him anymore.

441
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:18,045
And the lower classes have a very
very crude sense of loyalty.

442
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:21,352
- No offense.
- Eh?

443
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,656
I don't mean you.
You are lower class,

444
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:26,561
but that is to say, the lower class
in general, however.

445
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:29,964
A very crude sense
of loyalty.

446
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,559
Excuse me.

447
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:35,062
"My dear niece,

448
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,074
I hope you
and the children are well.

449
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:38,666
I have a task for you.

450
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:41,576
Policy dictates I give
a new wife to Pompey,

451
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:44,410
but I have been gone too long
to know who among the females

452
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,076
of our family
would be suitable.

453
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:48,608
I would ask Calpurnia,
but though an excellent wife,

454
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:51,486
she has no eye
for this kind of business.

455
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:53,820
Do me the favor
of selecting whichever girl

456
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:55,655
you think
most likely to please

457
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:58,321
and offer her
to him in my name".

458
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:03,826
Excuse me,
I was far away.

459
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:05,859
Caesar has no bad news
for you, I hope.

460
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:08,098
No, not at all.
Not at all.

461
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:10,403
- What a lovely party.
- Thank you.

462
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,239
Not as lovely
as you look in that dress.

463
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,507
Shh.

464
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:19,676
And Octavia...
beautiful.

465
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:21,912
Well, I try.

466
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:25,116
She will insist
on slouching.

467
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:27,181
Where's Octavian?

468
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:30,023
- He's in Gaul.
- Oh.

469
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:50,736
Great Mother says
no harm shall come to your boy.

470
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:52,265
Good.

471
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:59,649
Tell me now,
how goes your marriage?

472
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:01,413
Glabius is a good man.

473
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:04,944
You surprise me. I always thought
there were difficulties between you.

474
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,219
Must you always have
a needle in hand?

475
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:09,692
I was only asking.
Excuse my curiosity.

476
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,627
There was some difficulties
in the past,

477
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:13,562
but we overcame them.

478
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:15,759
We love each other
very much.

479
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,495
Well, that's a shame.
Now I feel bad.

480
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:20,095
I thought
you'd be overjoyed.

481
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:22,162
What do you mean?

482
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:26,436
Uncle Julius
intends to marry you

483
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:28,968
to Pompey Magnus.

484
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,581
- Uncle Julius intends...
- Pompey is a touch low in manner,

485
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:35,779
but I'm told he's
a perfectly adequate lover.

486
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,482
And you shall be
the first woman in Rome.

487
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,290
We shall have to get you divorced
from Glabius, obviously.

488
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:44,385
Quick as poss.

489
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,295
I will not do it.
I love my husband.

490
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:49,856
If you do not
divorce Glabius willingly,

491
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,993
then Caesar will ask
Glabius to divorce you.

492
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:54,971
- And Glabius will refuse.
- Doubtless, and then he'll be killed.

493
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:56,871
And does anybody
want that to happen?

494
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:00,303
Caesar would not do that.

495
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:03,711
The man's been in Gaul
for eight years.

496
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:05,648
He's practically
a wild beast.

497
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,731
The man has tears
in his eyes.

498
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:24,166
Tears.

499
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:26,431
He loves me.

500
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,064
A womanish husband
is no use to anyone.

501
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:31,131
And your servants!
What a fuss!

502
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:33,439
I think
you feed them too much.

503
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:38,478
A little more arsenic,
I think, Gaia.

504
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:41,883
Try to look a little
more cheerful, Octavia.

505
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:44,319
- It's for the good of the family.
- I don't care.

506
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:47,188
You and I and your brother
are alone in the world.

507
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:49,249
- We have to be strong.
- We are not alone.

508
00:38:49,293 --> 00:38:51,659
- Caesar is...
- Caesar is in Gaul.

509
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:53,687
Pompey is here.

510
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:57,425
Courage, my love.

511
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:08,174
The Parthian were threatening
my left flank.

512
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:11,670
And so, rather than
shorten the line

513
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,684
as would be
conventional,

514
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:18,519
I sent in my cavalry reserve
and outflanked the flankers.

515
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,460
Bravo, Magnus.
Masterly.

516
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:27,430
Is he not,
Octavia, masterly?

517
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:30,693
Masterly.

518
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:32,896
Magnus, tell me something,
and be honest.

519
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:34,928
Does my daughter
please you?

520
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:36,940
Very pleasing,
no doubt.

521
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:39,807
Then I can tell you
that Caesar,

522
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:41,971
as a token
of his abiding friendship,

523
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:45,175
would like to offer her
to you in marriage.

524
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:53,021
She is not married
to young Glabius?

525
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,252
Divorced.

526
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,091
- Perhaps you need time to think.
- Excuse me,

527
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:03,225
I was taken unawares.

528
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:07,499
How could I refuse such
a worthy and dignified bride?

529
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:10,701
- Caesar is far too generous.
- Excellent.

530
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,005
We would have to wait
until next month

531
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:14,977
for an actual ceremony,
of course,

532
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:17,412
when Julia's
mourning days are over.

533
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:19,609
Of course, of course.
But you may take

534
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:22,312
your betrothal privileges
any time you wish.

535
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,815
Now, if you like.

536
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:30,884
- Really, that's not necessary.
- Don't be silly.

537
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,658
Octavia would love to.

538
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:35,995
There's no need
for shyness.

539
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:39,093
We're all family now,
after all.

540
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:08,930
British women...
now, that's savage cunny.

541
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,991
You have to hunt them down
like deer.

542
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:12,832
Mind, once you get them
under you,

543
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,701
slack as your best
Narbo scortum.

544
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:16,706
Do you care
for nothing but women?

545
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,106
What else is there?
Food, I suppose.

546
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,804
You don't like women?

547
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,909
Of course I do.

548
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:25,745
I'm married to one.

549
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:29,014
- I have a wife, Niobe.
- I see. Centurions can marry then?

550
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:30,714
I received
a special dispensation.

551
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:34,246
A special dispensation?
She must be some good...

552
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:38,824
woman.

553
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:42,666
She is.

554
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:46,499
Been awhile
since you've seen her then.

555
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:49,472
Seven years,
140 days.

556
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:53,204
That's hard.
May fortune smile on you.

557
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:54,973
Me, I have simpler tastes.

558
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,310
I like to kill my enemy,
take their gold

559
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,009
and enjoy their women.

560
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:01,950
That's it.
Why tie yourself to one?

561
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:04,011
Where's the flavor?
Where's the joy?

562
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:06,318
When was the last time
you had a woman

563
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,587
who wasn't crying
or wanting payment?

564
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:14,593
You're on first watch. Wake me
when the moon's at the zenith.

565
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:16,930
Right you are, sir.

566
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:27,069
Halt!

567
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,009
Halt!

568
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:37,249
Sons of Dis!

569
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:47,293
They weren't
such good horses anyway.

570
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:49,265
My people fought
at Zama and Magnesia,

571
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,700
my father rode with Sulla,
and I'm reduced to this...

572
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,896
unhorsed and robbed
by children.

573
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:05,777
Nice horse.

574
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:31,435
Look here, Mars.
Look here, Mars.

575
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:34,842
I am Titus Pullo.
These bloody men, my gift to you.

576
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:39,971
Thank the gods you came.
I am extremely grateful to you.

577
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:42,178
Aye!

578
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:47,215
Listen to me. I order you
to release me this instant.

579
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:50,317
Fine way for an egg to talk.
You won't get far with a mouth on you.

580
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:54,593
I'm no egg. I'm Gaius Octavian
of the Julii.

581
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,930
- Great-nephew of Julius Caesar.
- Gaius who?

582
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:59,162
I am a Roman citizen
of noble birth,

583
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:01,398
and I order you
to cut these ropes.

584
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:03,030
Say please.

585
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:05,132
Please.

586
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,770
Be assured you will be
amply rewarded

587
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:40,868
for your services to me.

588
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:42,742
See how good he talks?

589
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,771
He's convincing,
I'll give him that.

590
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:46,908
Caesar will prove who I am.
Take me to him.

591
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:48,440
We cannot do that as yet.

592
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:50,043
- We have orders.
- What orders?

593
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:52,021
We are to retrieve
Caesar's stolen eagle.

594
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:53,853
Caesar wouldn't pull
a hair for his eagle.

595
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:55,449
You're on a fool's errand.

596
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:58,723
If Caesar doesn't care about the eagle,
why did he send us to find it?

597
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:00,423
It would look strange
if he made no efforts.

598
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:03,331
Actually, losing the eagle
is useful to Caesar.

599
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,164
Why would that be
useful to Caesar?

600
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,762
Because Pompey is
no deep philosopher.

601
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:10,035
He will take a symbolic loss
for a real weakness.

602
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:12,941
Explain.

603
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:16,343
Caesar doesn't want to strike
the first blow against an old friend,

604
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,349
so he wishes to lure Pompey
into attacking him first.

605
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:22,045
Pompey will only do this
if he believes Caesar is weak.

606
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:24,646
No. They're as good
as brothers, those two.

607
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:27,885
When Julia died, the last true bond
between them was cut.

608
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:31,053
Caesar has taken the love
of the common people from Pompey,

609
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:34,531
and that was his most prized
possession. A battle is inevitable.

610
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:48,238
Pullo.

611
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,180
Blue Spaniards!

612
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,833
Good morning, Uncle!

613
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:56,106
Octavian?

614
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:05,782
One of Pompey's men.
I misjudged him.

615
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,291
I thought it would take strategy
to turn him against me,

616
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,850
but he must have turned
the moment Julia died.

617
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:13,294
And all the while he was
defending you in the Senate.

618
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:17,027
He has the cunning
of a sardine, poor fool.

619
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:20,268
The battle begins.

620
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:23,432
About time.

621
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:42,349
Porca Juno.

622
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:46,089
"Dearest Pompey,

623
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:48,996
I believe the enclosed
man belongs to you.

624
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:51,432
A quick note to tell you
I have decided to winter

625
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:54,596
the 13th Legion
closer to home, at Ravenna,

626
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:59,007
so I shall soon have the pleasure
of paying you homage in person".

627
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:33,567
All of you, this is
my new wife, Cornelia.

628
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:43,109
Maybe if you'd
summoned a little charm

629
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:46,145
instead of moping about
like some torpid old she-cow,

630
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:48,214
- this would never have happened.
- Oh, my dear!

631
00:48:57,901 --> 00:49:01,200
Please, I was
only speaking in anger.

632
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,401
Everyone knows it's a
political repudiation on account

633
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:07,933
Pompey and Caesar
are enemies now.

634
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:11,271
One only has to look
at Cornelia.

635
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:13,476
Poor sad chicken,
plucked and boiled.

636
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,981
Maybe Glabius
will take me back.

637
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:19,682
Oh...

638
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:22,283
we are well rid of him.

639
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:25,625
We're going to find you somebody
much more worthwhile than Glabius.

640
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:28,859
I've been dishonored and shamed
before the whole city!

641
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:30,799
Nonsense!

642
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:33,064
A girl from a good family
can never be dishonored

643
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:35,367
by a villainous
little pleb like Pompey!

644
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:37,270
No...

645
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:40,936
it is I who has been made
to look foolish.

646
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:45,347
- It is I who have lost face!
- I want him dead.

647
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:46,940
I want him dead.

648
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:52,951
And that you shall have.

649
00:49:57,461 --> 00:50:00,294
Pompey will
eat sand for this.
