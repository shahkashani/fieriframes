1
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,512
Look around you.

2
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,355
Look around you.

3
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,914
Just look around you.

4
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,313
Have you worked out
what we're looking for?

5
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,358
Correct. The answer is...

6
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,717
This programme, "Sulphur",

7
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,349
can be found in chapter 4
of your textbook,

8
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,432
which accompanies this series.

9
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,796
Please ensure you have
your copybook at hand,

10
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,794
as you'll be asked to take down
notes from the screen

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,072
at various points
throughout the programme.

12
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,195
What's the first thing you think of
when you hear the word sulphur?

13
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,680
The benediction
of Our Lady Margaret?

14
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,436
Hydro-sulphic chlorination
of tetrametazine?

15
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,434
Or perhaps you think
of other things.

16
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,476
But think again, because sulphur,

17
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,394
valency 16, atomic weight 32,

18
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,917
Citadel 5 1 5 7 000,

19
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,120
is one of the building blocks
of life itself.

20
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,351
Ulphur...

21
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,596
Sulphur.

22
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,877
Write that down
in your copybook now.

23
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,991
Sulphur, like iron,
nickel and steel, is a metal.

24
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,794
It may not look like it, but it is.

25
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,717
We all know that if we place
a magnet close to most metals,

26
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,554
this happens. They stick.

27
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,434
It's called magnetism.

28
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,069
But what about sulphur?

29
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,352
An experiment was carried out

30
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,513
to ascertain whether sulphur
is attracted to magnets.

31
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,314
A lump of sulphur is placed
carefully onto a Bestal Heim plate.

32
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,278
The Bestal Heim is transported
to the base of a tripod...

33
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,432
(REVERSE WARNING TONE)

34
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,233
..and then covered
with an ordinary tissue.

35
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,195
Now we fetch the magnet.

36
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,759
The magnet is washed,

37
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,679
dried...

38
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:26,512
..and then fixed to a movable clamp
at the top of the tripod.

39
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,839
Get ready to take down notes
from the screen.

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,789
The scientist now removes
the tissue from the Bestal Heim.

41
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,191
With the tissue removal complete,

42
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,795
the lump of sulphur
is now totally exposed

43
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,236
to the power of the magnet.

44
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,556
The magnet is brought down slowly
towards the sulphur.

45
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,679
Keep watching,

46
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,232
neither taking your eyes
off the magnet, nor the sulphur.

47
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,240
So, is sulphur attracted
to magnets?

48
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,474
No.

49
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,758
From the results of this
experiment, we can conclude that...

50
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,752
Write that down.

51
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,429
The equipment is now dismantled

52
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,990
and then destroyed.

53
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,397
(GUN CLICKS)

54
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,671
Now let's take a look at some of
the ways in which sulphur is used.

55
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,957
Have your copybooks ready.

56
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,237
Sulphur is the trusty companion

57
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,710
of sailors and mariners
the world over,

58
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,635
because it's used
in the production of butter.

59
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,752
(TOOTS)

60
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,711
It's also used
in the removal of stubbo.

61
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,638
But perhaps most importantly
of all,

62
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,840
sulphur is used to make this,
the humble match-head.

63
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,592
Peter Jackmond

64
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,992
is the Managing Director
of Lightning Decision Matches.

65
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,197
In an average year,

66
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,876
we get through roughly
40 tons of sulphur.

67
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,592
This translates into approximately
21 million individual matches.

68
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,434
Since the company was formed,

69
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,391
we've produced 156 million,
280 thousand matches.

70
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,632
If we continue
at the current rate of production,

71
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,076
by the year 3500,

72
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,952
we'll have made 900 thousand,
billion, billion, billion, billion,

73
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,874
billion, billion matches.

74
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,636
- (PHONE RINGS)
- That's a lot of matches.

75
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,352
An experiment was carried out

76
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,117
to observe the effects of sulphur
upon a solution rich in iron.

77
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,432
We're going to be using
one household item

78
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,671
famous for its iron content.

79
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,116
Can you work out what it is?

80
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,075
Correct.

81
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,955
A quantity of champagne is
poured into a large glass trough.

82
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,592
We're using about 17 bottlesworth.

83
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,992
There's a lot of cheap brands
on the market these days,

84
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,120
but we suggest using
one of the better ones.

85
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,000
Next, a small amount
of powdered sulphur

86
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,516
is dropped into the champagne

87
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,597
and the solution is agitated,
producing...

88
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,477
Write that down.

89
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:04,156
Now a big beaker of sulphagne
is brought to over to our subject.

90
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,111
This is Len Pounds, a lab assistant
working at the British University.

91
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,272
Because sulphagne
has a rather eggy smell,

92
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,358
nasal corks are applied.

93
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,232
Next, Len takes a few gulps
of our solution.

94
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,559
Observe the reaction and note down
the result in your copybooks.

95
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,311
The sulphagne appears to have taken
effect almost immediately.

96
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,598
Note Len's clammy brow
and cheeks.

97
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,950
The scientist instructs Len
to concentrate on the test tube.

98
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,077
The test tube has disappeared.

99
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,755
Now we try something larger.

100
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,432
Also gone.

101
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,151
You've probably seen this process
in action at your local dump,

102
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,552
as it's used in
the waste-disposal industry.

103
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,872
However, scientists
are as yet unsure

104
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,635
as to why this phenomenon
should occur,

105
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,032
but it's thought there must be
a simple scientific reason.

106
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,795
What that is, we just don' t know.

107
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,238
Write that down
in your copybook now.

108
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,517
(GUNSHOTS)

109
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,672
(GUN CLICKS)

110
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,519
Now hand in your copybooks
to your teacher or head of class.

111
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,680
In the next programme,
we will look at Italians.
