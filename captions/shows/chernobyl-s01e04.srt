00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,760
When I was 12,
the revolution came.

39

Then Bolsheviks.

42

Then there was Stalin
and his famine,

to leave.

00:02:47,553 --> 00:02:49,303

After all that I have seen...

Of gross incompetence,
violation of safety regulations,

582
00:56:28,094 --> 00:56:30,264
recklessness beyond belief.

583
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:32,925
But the explosion?
I'm not sure.

584
00:56:33,011 --> 00:56:35,351
What do you mean
you're not sure?

585
00:56:36,178 --> 00:56:38,258
I've analyzed the data.

586
00:56:38,345 --> 00:56:40,505
Toptunov was telling the truth.

587
00:56:40,595 --> 00:56:43,965
They shut the reactor down,
and then it exploded.

588
00:56:45,386 --> 00:56:48,756
I think this article
my have the answer,

589
00:56:48,845 --> 00:56:52,295
but two pages
have been removed.

590
00:56:57,845 --> 00:56:59,715
You've seen this before.

591
00:56:59,803 --> 00:57:02,553
Please, believe me
when I tell you that

592
00:57:02,637 --> 00:57:05,047
I had no idea it could
cause an explosion.

593
00:57:05,136 --> 00:57:08,136
-None of us knew.
-None of you knew what?

594
00:57:09,428 --> 00:57:12,428
In 1975, in an RBMK
reactor in Leningrad,

595
00:57:12,511 --> 00:57:14,851
a fuel channel ruptured.

596
00:57:14,928 --> 00:57:16,718
The operators pressed AZ-5,

597
00:57:16,803 --> 00:57:19,553
but instead of the power
going down immediately,

598
00:57:19,637 --> 00:57:22,507
for a brief moment
it went up.

599
00:57:22,595 --> 00:57:24,345
How is that possible?

600
00:57:24,428 --> 00:57:25,798
Well, this was
the very question posed

601
00:57:25,887 --> 00:57:27,797
by a colleague of mine
named Volkov.

602
00:57:27,887 --> 00:57:29,847
He's the one who
wrote this article.

603
00:57:29,928 --> 00:57:33,678
When an RBMK reactor
runs at low power,
it's notoriously unstable.

604
00:57:33,762 --> 00:57:37,092
Prone to swings
in reactivity.

605
00:57:37,178 --> 00:57:38,598
Under normal circumstances,

606
00:57:38,678 --> 00:57:40,508
the control rods can
compensate for that.

607
00:57:40,595 --> 00:57:41,965
Under normal circumstances.

608
00:57:42,053 --> 00:57:45,513
The Chernobyl staff stalled
the reactor during the test.

609
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:47,425
They pulled almost
all the control rods out

610
00:57:47,511 --> 00:57:51,351
-to bring the power back up.
-This is what Volkov learned
from Leningrad.

611
00:57:51,428 --> 00:57:52,848
If the boron control rods

612
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:55,638
are completely withdrawn
from the reactor,

613
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,010
when they're put back in,

614
00:57:57,094 --> 00:58:00,224
the first thing that enters
the core isn't boron.

615
00:58:00,303 --> 00:58:02,513
It's graphite.

616
00:58:05,678 --> 00:58:07,928
The control rods
have graphite tips

617
00:58:08,011 --> 00:58:10,431
that displace
water and steam.

618
00:58:10,511 --> 00:58:12,851
So the reactivity
doesn't go down.

619
00:58:12,928 --> 00:58:15,008
It goes up dramatically.

620
00:58:15,094 --> 00:58:18,474
(Scoffs)
Why on Earth would
they press that button?

621
00:58:18,553 --> 00:58:20,553
They didn't know.

622
00:58:22,386 --> 00:58:25,006
Legasov:
Volkov warned
the Kremlin,

623
00:58:25,094 --> 00:58:26,854
ten years ago.

624
00:58:27,595 --> 00:58:30,135
(Sighs)
But there could
be no doubt

625
00:58:30,219 --> 00:58:34,089
about the supremacy of
the Soviet nuclear industry.

626
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:36,008
Ah.

627
00:58:36,094 --> 00:58:39,764
The KGB classified it
as a state secret.

628
00:58:42,011 --> 00:58:43,511
Legasov:
When I saw the reactor
blown open,

629
00:58:43,595 --> 00:58:47,045
I still didn't think it could
be this flaw in AZ-5.

630
00:58:47,136 --> 00:58:50,176
Because the flaw will not
lead to an explosion

631
00:58:50,261 --> 00:58:55,431
unless the operators
have pushed the reactor
to the edge of disaster.

632
00:58:55,511 --> 00:58:58,351
-So it is their fault?
-Yes.

633
00:58:58,428 --> 00:59:00,468
But not only
their fault.

634
00:59:01,887 --> 00:59:03,387
No.

635
00:59:04,511 --> 00:59:07,091
Is that what you're
going to say in Vienna?

636
00:59:08,803 --> 00:59:09,933
(Sighs)

637
00:59:10,011 --> 00:59:13,011
You can't possibly
be that naive.

638
00:59:13,094 --> 00:59:16,514
There are 16 RBMK reactors

639
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:19,385
running in the Soviet Union
right now.

640
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:21,430
We have to fix them.

641
00:59:21,511 --> 00:59:24,221
The only way to do that
is to go public,

642
00:59:24,303 --> 00:59:26,303
force the Central Committee
to take action.

643
00:59:26,386 --> 00:59:29,386
What you're proposing is that
Legasov humiliate a nation

644
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:32,470
that is obsessed with
not being humiliated.

645
00:59:32,553 --> 00:59:35,013
We can make a deal
with the KGB.

646
00:59:35,094 --> 00:59:37,184
You'll leave this information
out in Vienna,

647
00:59:37,261 --> 00:59:40,391
and they quietly let us fix
the remaining reactors.

648
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:42,800
A deal with the KGB?

649
00:59:42,887 --> 00:59:44,597
And I'm "naive."

650
00:59:45,845 --> 00:59:49,295

They'll go after your family,
they'll go after your friends.

Khomyuk:
You have a chance to talk
to the world, Valery.

652
00:59:52,303 --> 00:59:54,183
If that chance was mine--

653
00:59:54,261 --> 00:59:55,931
But it isn't, is it?

654
00:59:57,178 --> 01:00:00,298

Because when it's your life and
the lives of everyone you love,

657
01:00:06,845 --> 01:00:09,465
your moral conviction
doesn't mean anything.

658
01:00:09,553 --> 01:00:11,683
It leaves you.

659
01:00:11,762 --> 01:00:16,302
And all you want at that moment
is not to be shot.

660
01:00:20,345 --> 01:00:22,715

Vasily Ignatenko?

661
01:00:22,803 --> 01:00:24,353

663
01:00:28,511 --> 01:00:31,601

after the accident.

664
01:00:31,678 --> 01:00:34,548
I've been looking in

665
01:00:34,637 --> 01:00:36,427
She gave birth.

666
