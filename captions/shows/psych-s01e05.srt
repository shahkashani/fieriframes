1
00:00:08,924 --> 00:00:10,356
This isn't happening to me!

2
00:00:10,357 --> 00:00:12,017
What is happening to you,
Shawn?

3
00:00:12,018 --> 00:00:13,958
Only the worst thing ever!

4
00:00:13,959 --> 00:00:16,826
A missing Captain Delicious
magic mood ring!

5
00:00:16,827 --> 00:00:19,833
Dad, this is a crime.
Can you have them arrested?

6
00:00:19,834 --> 00:00:21,926
First of all, Shawn, no,
this is not a crime.

7
00:00:21,927 --> 00:00:23,595
Can't you just haul them in
for questioning?

8
00:00:23,596 --> 00:00:25,696
Lay into them a little?
And who is "them"?

9
00:00:25,697 --> 00:00:27,831
You know, the cereal people?

10
00:00:27,832 --> 00:00:29,900
Oh, the cereal people, huh?

11
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:32,678
Well, I'll tell you what, Shawn,
you can spend a lot of time

12
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:35,772
<i>calling 411 to get the number
for your cereal people,</i>

13
00:00:35,773 --> 00:00:37,077
they're gonna stick you
on hold forever,

14
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,310
listening to bad music.

15
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:40,353
Finally, you're gonna get
some dimwitted secretary,

16
00:00:40,354 --> 00:00:41,786
who's gonna
take your message,

17
00:00:41,787 --> 00:00:44,347
and then she's gonna
throw it in a waste bucket.

18
00:00:44,348 --> 00:00:47,258
Or you can use the skills
I taught you

19
00:00:47,962 --> 00:00:49,759
and you can outsmart them.

20
00:00:53,434 --> 00:00:55,095
What am I missing?

21
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,468
Where is the ring?
Well, it'd be at the bottom.

22
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:01,905
Not in this box, you're right.

23
00:01:01,906 --> 00:01:04,135
The big old bad cereal company
messed up.

24
00:01:04,136 --> 00:01:06,043
So, you grab another box,
tough luck.

25
00:01:06,347 --> 00:01:08,109
Where's the ring now?

26
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,877
At the bottom. Now I got
to eat the whole box.

27
00:01:13,087 --> 00:01:14,644
And where's the ring now?

28
00:01:14,645 --> 00:01:15,983
At the top!

29
00:01:15,984 --> 00:01:19,286
That's right. You see, sometimes,
Shawn, you don't have to dig so deep.

30
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:22,054
All you gotta do is turn something
upside down to make it right side up.

31
00:01:22,055 --> 00:01:23,495
And then...

32
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:27,928
you get your prize.

33
00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:29,434
Thanks, Dad!

34
00:01:31,605 --> 00:01:33,663
Explain to me again why we
couldn't sit in a restaurant

35
00:01:33,664 --> 00:01:35,207
and eat
like civilized people.

36
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:37,242
Moving is good, Gus,
it helps the digestion.

37
00:01:37,243 --> 00:01:38,936
Plus, you and I
never do this anymore.

38
00:01:38,937 --> 00:01:40,240
What? Eat and jog?

39
00:01:40,241 --> 00:01:42,110
No, talk. Just talk.

40
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:44,175
Check in with each other,
as men.

41
00:01:44,176 --> 00:01:45,513
I wanna know
how you are.

42
00:01:45,514 --> 00:01:47,553
I wanna know
how Gus is.

43
00:01:47,989 --> 00:01:49,955
Really? Like you're
really asking me?

44
00:01:49,956 --> 00:01:52,217
Yes, I'm really asking,
because I care.

45
00:01:52,218 --> 00:01:53,623
Wow, okay.

46
00:01:54,127 --> 00:01:56,526
Well, we've been working
cases nonstop for a month.

47
00:01:56,527 --> 00:01:58,257
To be honest, I'm burnt.

48
00:01:58,498 --> 00:02:00,430
I just want to take a nap.

49
00:02:00,431 --> 00:02:01,864
I couldn't agree
with you more, buddy.

50
00:02:01,865 --> 00:02:03,401
I think we should
lay low for a bit.

51
00:02:03,402 --> 00:02:05,629
No more cases. Oh, I'm so
glad to hear you say that.

52
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,966
I was kind of worried
about telling you.

53
00:02:06,967 --> 00:02:08,940
Don't be a silly goose.

54
00:02:09,743 --> 00:02:12,642
Now, we've had a good talk,
I think we both felt it,

55
00:02:12,643 --> 00:02:14,680
and look at this.
Here we are.

56
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,648
What is this, Shawn?

57
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,980
Okay, here's the thing.

58
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:24,080
The police may have
found a body,

59
00:02:24,591 --> 00:02:26,353
which I may have picked up
on my police scanner,

60
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:29,655
which I may have
brought with me.

61
00:02:29,656 --> 00:02:30,853
No cases, Shawn.

62
00:02:30,854 --> 00:02:34,696
No cases. We go in, we see.
We say hello. And we leave.

63
00:02:35,034 --> 00:02:37,900
Say hello? This is a crime scene.
You can't just walk in there.

64
00:02:37,901 --> 00:02:40,837
McNab. Nabby!

65
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,199
Buzz.

66
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,365
Buzz? Seriously?

67
00:02:43,366 --> 00:02:45,102
That's his first name.
Don't you ever talk to him?

68
00:02:45,103 --> 00:02:47,041
Why would I talk
to anybody named Buzz?

69
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,772
Shawn! My man!

70
00:02:48,773 --> 00:02:49,905
Pow!

71
00:02:50,716 --> 00:02:54,709
Okay with... Yes.
You look trim.

72
00:02:55,654 --> 00:02:57,177
Somebody made
their wedding weight.

73
00:02:57,178 --> 00:03:00,019
Five more pounds. I'm close.
But I still have a month.

74
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,787
You'll get there.
You remember my partner?

75
00:03:02,788 --> 00:03:04,828
Sure, yeah. Matt, right?

76
00:03:05,431 --> 00:03:06,453
Gus.

77
00:03:06,454 --> 00:03:07,589
Right.

78
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,825
So, what do you got going on up
there? Don't hold out on me now.

79
00:03:09,826 --> 00:03:11,027
Looks like suicide.

80
00:03:11,028 --> 00:03:13,899
A guy from the phone company
found the victim in his apartment.

81
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,564
Been up there
for a few days already.

82
00:03:15,565 --> 00:03:16,867
Few days?

83
00:03:16,868 --> 00:03:19,670
You mind if we head up, take
a look, poke around a little?

84
00:03:19,671 --> 00:03:22,610
Oh, I don't know. Lassiter's
up there and he's in a mood.

85
00:03:22,611 --> 00:03:25,478
Yeah, we just, uh,
got his coffee.

86
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:27,141
Wanted to bring it by,
make it right.

87
00:03:27,142 --> 00:03:28,445
Oh, that's nice of you.

88
00:03:28,446 --> 00:03:31,113
He asked me to get it,
but this is perfect.

89
00:03:34,592 --> 00:03:36,685
Hey, did you just sip that?

90
00:03:37,128 --> 00:03:39,789
You don't taste Lassiter's
coffee before you give it to him?

91
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,228
That surprises me, Buzz.

92
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:43,493
He's so particular.
No cream, no sugar...

93
00:03:43,494 --> 00:03:45,035
It's three creams,
four sugars.

94
00:03:45,836 --> 00:03:47,236
Yeah, it is.

95
00:03:48,238 --> 00:03:50,297
Sharp as a tack.
You!

96
00:03:50,298 --> 00:03:51,364
And fit!

97
00:04:05,255 --> 00:04:06,552
We found a note.

98
00:04:06,553 --> 00:04:09,091
The body's been here at
least three days. Maybe more.

99
00:04:09,092 --> 00:04:11,319
<i>All signs point to a 11-44.</i>

100
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,658
<i>Three 11-44s
in four months?</i>

101
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:15,924
There must be something
in the water. Uh-huh.

102
00:04:15,925 --> 00:04:18,432
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
listen up. You know the procedure.

103
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:21,961
I want this done right.
I do not want any mistakes.

104
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,440
Hey, blowie,

105
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,899
I know you're new,
but next time if you want

106
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,568
to get your spit
all over the evidence,

107
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,204
why don't you
just lick it?

108
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:33,243
Clearly he doesn't need
any more coffee.

109
00:04:33,244 --> 00:04:35,511
Okay, there is the dead guy.
Can we go now?

110
00:04:35,512 --> 00:04:37,984
Relax. We just got here.
Have some mee krob.

111
00:04:37,985 --> 00:04:40,545
How do you just eat when
there's a dead guy laying there?

112
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:43,024
What, is that rude?
Am I supposed to share?

113
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,990
Forensics.

114
00:04:47,898 --> 00:04:49,091
Act natural.

115
00:04:51,435 --> 00:04:52,765
That's it!

116
00:04:52,766 --> 00:04:54,234
What? What do you see?

117
00:04:55,706 --> 00:04:57,035
Red pepper flakes.

118
00:04:57,036 --> 00:04:58,130
Is that a clue
or something?

119
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,730
No, it's a delicious spice,

120
00:04:59,731 --> 00:05:02,209
and it's exactly what my mee
krob needs. I told you this.

121
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:07,915
What are you doing? This is a
crime scene. You can't touch stuff.

122
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:13,047
What?

123
00:05:17,493 --> 00:05:19,518
Seriously, check this out.

124
00:05:22,398 --> 00:05:23,762
A marinating steak?

125
00:05:23,763 --> 00:05:25,265
What, you want
to eat that, too?

126
00:05:25,266 --> 00:05:27,096
No, but don't you find
that a little odd?

127
00:05:27,097 --> 00:05:28,760
That a man
would eat a steak?

128
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:30,464
No, that a man who was
ready to kill himself

129
00:05:30,465 --> 00:05:33,872
would take the time to marinate
a steak for a future meal?

130
00:05:36,512 --> 00:05:37,638
Dude,

131
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,146
this was not suicide.
This was murder.

132
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,060
The door latch
is still intact.

133
00:05:58,299 --> 00:06:01,062
Now I ask you. If you
were gonna kill yourself,

134
00:06:01,063 --> 00:06:02,762
wouldn't you want
the door to be locked

135
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:05,737
so that no one could barge
in on you right in the middle?

136
00:06:05,738 --> 00:06:08,640
What? I don't...
What is it? I don't...

137
00:06:09,444 --> 00:06:11,035
What in the name
of sweet justice

138
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:12,703
are you two doing
in my crime scene?

139
00:06:12,704 --> 00:06:14,179
Your crime scene?
That's funny.

140
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,681
I didn't see your name
on it anywhere.

141
00:06:15,682 --> 00:06:17,944
Get out.
We are.

142
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:21,920
Just thought you might wanna know
that this thing here, not a suicide.

143
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:23,047
Great.

144
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:26,787
Thanks for that. Really. And thanks also
for bringing a snack to the crime scene.

145
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:34,696
Oh, boy. Oh!

146
00:06:37,237 --> 00:06:38,670
I'm sensing a...

147
00:06:38,671 --> 00:06:40,433
I'm sensing
there was someone here.

148
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:43,671
Someone here in the room
with the victim when he died.

149
00:06:44,044 --> 00:06:46,137
Someone with
a sliver of grease

150
00:06:46,138 --> 00:06:48,010
on his or her shoe.

151
00:06:49,016 --> 00:06:51,917
No, I'm not sensing
a struggle. No struggle.

152
00:06:56,523 --> 00:06:57,785
The door.

153
00:06:58,058 --> 00:06:59,752
Did you have to break down
the door when you got here?

154
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:00,815
No, it was open. Why?

155
00:07:00,816 --> 00:07:02,622
No, no.
Don't encourage him.

156
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:03,957
Get up! McNab,

157
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,760
I want you to escort these
two men out of here now!

158
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:09,028
Come on, let me read the
witnesses. You know, due diligence.

159
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,728
Spencer, we did
the due diligence.

160
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:14,068
It was a suicide. There is no
crime. There are no witnesses.

161
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:16,735
You're wrong.
There is a witness.

162
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,969
There's a cat.

163
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,212
I wanna talk to that cat.

164
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:29,386
As soon as he's finished
licking himself.

165
00:07:34,193 --> 00:07:36,320
Wow, I'm jealous.

166
00:07:41,734 --> 00:07:45,499
<i>I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth</i>

167
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,539
<i>I know, you know
They just don't have any proof</i>

168
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,735
<i>Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend</i>

169
00:07:51,736 --> 00:07:56,339
<i>Your worst inhibitions tend
to psych you out in the end</i>

170
00:08:02,454 --> 00:08:03,944
I can't believe
you took that cat.

171
00:08:03,945 --> 00:08:05,956
Gus, they were gonna ship him
off to an animal shelter.

172
00:08:05,957 --> 00:08:07,048
What choice did I have?

173
00:08:07,049 --> 00:08:08,888
Plus, this cat
is the lead witness

174
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,689
in a major murder
investigation. Wanna hold him?

175
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,592
Oh, no, you don't.
I'm not touching that cat.

176
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:14,597
You took the cat,
you carry it.

177
00:08:14,598 --> 00:08:16,530
We are right on
this thing now.

178
00:08:16,531 --> 00:08:18,192
I didn't have
anything substantial.

179
00:08:18,193 --> 00:08:20,635
A steak, the chain on the
door, a stain on a carpet...

180
00:08:20,636 --> 00:08:23,435
I wouldn't have believed me. We
needed an in. Now we have one.

181
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,532
Plus, he clearly likes you.
Give him a snuggle.

182
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:27,440
You know what?
I'm actually gonna enjoy this.

183
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:28,843
You having to carry
this cat around,

184
00:08:28,844 --> 00:08:30,403
pretending you can
communicate with it.

185
00:08:30,404 --> 00:08:31,948
I'm buying
a disposable camera

186
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:33,848
for when you have to clean
out its dirty litter box.

187
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:36,820
Let me tell you something.
This cat here is a gift.

188
00:08:37,188 --> 00:08:39,417
A conduit for us
to save lives.

189
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,821
And he has more integrity
in his furry little hand...

190
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:42,916
Paw.
Paw.

191
00:08:42,917 --> 00:08:46,292
...than most people have
in their whole appendages.

192
00:08:47,732 --> 00:08:48,924
Appendages.

193
00:08:48,925 --> 00:08:50,057
What?

194
00:08:50,058 --> 00:08:51,361
All of them.

195
00:08:51,362 --> 00:08:54,405
Than most people have
in all of their appendages

196
00:08:54,673 --> 00:08:55,799
combined.

197
00:08:57,031 --> 00:08:59,871
Oh, yeah? I think he wants to
sleep on your chair. Isn't it cool?

198
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,376
How long are you
gonna keep this up for?

199
00:09:01,377 --> 00:09:03,538
Until we solve the crime.

200
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:05,776
Don't you or your cat
get mad at me,

201
00:09:05,777 --> 00:09:07,146
but I don't think
there was a crime.

202
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:08,410
Oh, really?
You don't think so?

203
00:09:08,411 --> 00:09:10,544
No. Try telling that
to this poor little guy

204
00:09:10,545 --> 00:09:13,590
who is traumatized seeing
his owner killed. Tell him.

205
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,618
I'm just saying

206
00:09:17,619 --> 00:09:19,662
I can kind of get
where Lassiter is coming from.

207
00:09:19,663 --> 00:09:21,526
A few suicides
is not uncommon.

208
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,793
Gus, did you look
at the sky today?

209
00:09:23,794 --> 00:09:25,232
Blue, clear.

210
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:27,963
And did you feel it
out there? Warm. Nice.

211
00:09:27,964 --> 00:09:29,800
Statistically,
people in mild climates

212
00:09:29,801 --> 00:09:31,863
are far less likely
to kill themselves.

213
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:34,910
Now, if we were in
Vladivostok, we could talk.

214
00:09:34,911 --> 00:09:36,343
Point is,
at the end of the day,

215
00:09:36,344 --> 00:09:39,109
this was a 50-year-old man
living alone with a cat.

216
00:09:40,945 --> 00:09:43,316
Do you want down?
You can get down.

217
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:51,390
You're probably right.

218
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:52,792
I know I'm right.

219
00:09:54,098 --> 00:09:56,123
It was probably a suicide.

220
00:09:56,634 --> 00:09:57,998
Thank you.

221
00:09:58,636 --> 00:10:00,499
That was big of you to admit.

222
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,197
I'm just... I'm unclear
on one little thing.

223
00:10:03,198 --> 00:10:04,636
What's that?

224
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:07,504
How do we explain the
second body they just found?

225
00:10:07,505 --> 00:10:09,807
<i>Deceased is in the car, over.</i>

226
00:10:14,784 --> 00:10:16,412
Detective O'Hara.

227
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,587
What, you're here
all by yourself?

228
00:10:20,781 --> 00:10:21,846
Ah!

229
00:10:23,986 --> 00:10:25,891
Damn it all.

230
00:10:28,698 --> 00:10:29,891
Could have happened
to anybody.

231
00:10:29,892 --> 00:10:31,057
Talk to me.

232
00:10:31,058 --> 00:10:34,796
Well, victim is a female in
her late 20s, Gloria Starks.

233
00:10:34,797 --> 00:10:37,236
We're waiting for forensics to
confirm, but appears to be a suicide.

234
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,431
Carbon monoxide poisoning.
Asphyxiation.

235
00:10:39,432 --> 00:10:41,771
Oh, I'm afraid
the cat doesn't think so.

236
00:10:41,772 --> 00:10:43,606
Turn around
and walk away.

237
00:10:43,607 --> 00:10:45,476
This cat can tell us
if the killer has been here.

238
00:10:45,477 --> 00:10:46,672
All I need is 30 seconds.

239
00:10:46,673 --> 00:10:49,045
Watch this. You ready boy?
Huh? You ready?

240
00:10:49,046 --> 00:10:51,950
What? What, over here?
Where? Wait.

241
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,920
That is... That is very
thoughtful. I'll tell him.

242
00:10:57,921 --> 00:10:59,992
He says the fact that
you take three creams

243
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,495
and four sugars
in your coffee, dangerous.

244
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:03,552
Is that true?

245
00:11:03,553 --> 00:11:05,792
Do you really take three
creams and four sugars?

246
00:11:05,793 --> 00:11:07,333
So what?
So what?

247
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,392
Carly, that is a heart attack
waiting to happen.

248
00:11:09,393 --> 00:11:10,495
You're still a young man.

249
00:11:10,496 --> 00:11:12,972
That was amazing. How did you
do that? It was a lucky guess.

250
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:14,906
Don't you get tired
of saying that?

251
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,269
Now, with your permission,

252
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,574
I'd like the little boy cat
to sniff out the car.

253
00:11:21,016 --> 00:11:22,573
Absolutely not.

254
00:11:22,574 --> 00:11:23,948
Oops!

255
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:25,711
What did I just say?

256
00:11:25,712 --> 00:11:27,583
Just relax and
let him do his job.

257
00:11:27,584 --> 00:11:29,647
He might find something.

258
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,426
He's peeing.

259
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:38,221
No.

260
00:11:38,222 --> 00:11:41,462
No, he's drawing your attention
to the evidence in the back seat.

261
00:11:41,463 --> 00:11:43,366
By peeing on it. Nice.

262
00:11:44,473 --> 00:11:46,566
Come here, kitty,
kitty, kitty.

263
00:11:48,109 --> 00:11:50,099
Yes, did you make
good pee-pee?

264
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,542
Did you make
good pee-pee?

265
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:53,136
Yes, you did. What?

266
00:11:56,585 --> 00:11:58,916
What. That's a...
That's a little inappropriate.

267
00:12:00,484 --> 00:12:02,521
I'm sorry, that's rude.

268
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:04,887
He was just saying that he
would have done the same thing,

269
00:12:04,888 --> 00:12:06,516
if he'd killed himself.

270
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:10,121
He would have swung by the dry
cleaners and grabbed the pantsuit first.

271
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:13,164
Maybe she picked up
the dry-cleaning days ago.

272
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:14,701
Did the cat
ever think of that?

273
00:12:15,136 --> 00:12:16,999
What is he doing
right here?

274
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,233
He is measuring the amount
of carbon monoxide emitted.

275
00:12:20,234 --> 00:12:23,571
Uh-huh. Okay. I knew that.

276
00:12:23,572 --> 00:12:24,941
Yeah, you did.

277
00:12:29,344 --> 00:12:30,474
Whoa!

278
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,084
Now, does she strike you as the
type that would go for heavy metal?

279
00:12:36,085 --> 00:12:38,522
Any number of people could
have changed her radio station.

280
00:12:38,523 --> 00:12:40,957
Now, Mr. Spencer, if you
and your new partner

281
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:44,190
are finished urinating on things,
I believe your work here is done.

282
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:47,799
Check out the dry-cleaning.
I'm on it.

283
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:53,201
Look, I don't care
what Lassiter says.

284
00:12:53,202 --> 00:12:55,968
The cat is not my new partner,
Gus. Don't be ridiculous.

285
00:12:55,969 --> 00:12:58,066
Then tell me again why the
cat gets to ride shotgun?

286
00:12:58,067 --> 00:12:59,940
He gets carsick,
and you know this.

287
00:12:59,941 --> 00:13:01,707
Do you want him to throw
up again back there?

288
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,111
Is that what you want?

289
00:13:03,112 --> 00:13:04,707
It's not funny, Shawn.

290
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,342
Here, lay these down.

291
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,380
He's doing fine, aren't you?

292
00:13:09,381 --> 00:13:10,750
This is a company car, Shawn.

293
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:12,949
That means I have to return it
in like-new condition.

294
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,550
Lay these down.

295
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,831
Whoa, whoa! Look at this!
What?

296
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,230
"Seventy percent off of storm
doors and window panes."

297
00:13:27,231 --> 00:13:29,332
"Everything must go."
Gus, flip it over.

298
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:31,839
It's her.

299
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,040
"Struggling actress lands big
break in Santa Barbara play."

300
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,910
And then kills herself?
I don't think so.

301
00:13:36,911 --> 00:13:39,712
Okay, you might be
onto something. Yeah.

302
00:13:39,713 --> 00:13:41,718
<i>The play is called
Dazzle and Stretch.</i>

303
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:43,550
<i>Dazzle and Stretch?</i>

304
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:51,491
I was wondering if
I could ask you a question.

305
00:13:51,492 --> 00:13:53,827
I could
really use some advice.

306
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:58,564
Yeah, all right.
Get on in here.

307
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,040
What can I do for you, McNab?

308
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:11,105
It's just that, well...
You're still married, right?

309
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,217
Are you trying to piss
me off? No, sir, no.

310
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,010
I just have a question.

311
00:14:17,956 --> 00:14:20,320
On your wedding night
did you feel any,

312
00:14:20,321 --> 00:14:23,792
well, any added pressure
to perform?

313
00:14:23,793 --> 00:14:25,886
Excuse me?
It's just that my Francie

314
00:14:25,887 --> 00:14:29,523
is going to be expecting a lot on
our first night as a married couple,

315
00:14:29,524 --> 00:14:32,432
and I was wondering
if you had any tips for me.

316
00:14:32,433 --> 00:14:35,665
What the hell kind
of sick bastard are you?

317
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,471
Thank you very much, sir.
I appreciate it.

318
00:14:39,176 --> 00:14:41,440
So, what you are
trying to tell me is

319
00:14:42,213 --> 00:14:45,774
now it's the cat that's
convinced these weren't suicides?

320
00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:47,073
Yes.

321
00:14:47,074 --> 00:14:50,017
Do you really think I'm going
to open a bunch of closed cases

322
00:14:50,018 --> 00:14:51,520
just because
a cat tells me to?

323
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,524
This is it.

324
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,700
Yes, this is it.

325
00:15:06,503 --> 00:15:08,436
The girl that was
found in her car,

326
00:15:08,437 --> 00:15:11,565
Gloria Starks, she's here.

327
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,375
She's here with us.

328
00:15:23,386 --> 00:15:25,014
Oh, despair!

329
00:15:25,956 --> 00:15:29,619
I fear that you will leave me.
What choice do I have?

330
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:33,789
<i>I dazzle</i>

331
00:15:35,031 --> 00:15:36,726
<i>And I stretch</i>

332
00:15:37,901 --> 00:15:39,425
<i>I dazzle</i>

333
00:15:39,969 --> 00:15:43,201
<i>And I stretch</i>

334
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,905
What the hell
is going on here?

335
00:15:44,906 --> 00:15:47,808
Mr. Spencer,
this is telling me nothing.

336
00:15:48,578 --> 00:15:51,569
He can't hear you right now 'cause,
see, he's channeling the cat

337
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,114
who's channeling Gloria.

338
00:15:53,115 --> 00:15:54,513
<i>I dazzle</i>

339
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,785
Well, then
what are we looking at?

340
00:15:58,588 --> 00:15:59,848
Bad acting.

341
00:15:59,849 --> 00:16:02,389
I think she wants you
to see something in the paper.

342
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,154
Gloria's trying to
tell you something.

343
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:07,522
<i>Dazzle and stretch</i>

344
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:11,495
"Seventy percent off on
storm doors and window panes.

345
00:16:11,496 --> 00:16:12,932
"Everything must go."

346
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:22,168
"Struggling actress lands big
break in Santa Barbara play."

347
00:16:22,169 --> 00:16:23,938
- So what.
- So what?

348
00:16:23,939 --> 00:16:25,673
Does that sound like a woman
who would kill herself?

349
00:16:25,674 --> 00:16:27,578
Please,
all actresses are crazies.

350
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:30,345
I know, I dated one in college
once. She had a nose ring.

351
00:16:31,647 --> 00:16:33,278
Good work, little buddy.

352
00:16:33,755 --> 00:16:35,656
Whoa!
I don't know.

353
00:16:35,957 --> 00:16:38,187
This is something. Something?
Oh, come on, you guys.

354
00:16:38,188 --> 00:16:40,625
That's the biggest thing that
ever happened for that girl.

355
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:43,095
Now you need to stop waiting
around for another suicide

356
00:16:43,096 --> 00:16:45,530
and start looking
for a serial killer.

357
00:16:45,531 --> 00:16:46,932
Spencer,

358
00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:49,229
get off my lap.

359
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:04,081
What does this mean?

360
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,087
<i>I have no idea, but I've
seen it on Numb3rs all the time</i>

361
00:17:08,088 --> 00:17:09,680
and it seems
to work for them.

362
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,216
You ready to give up?

363
00:17:12,217 --> 00:17:15,159
Four separate suicides, two of which
occurred before we came on the case,

364
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,492
and I don't see
a pattern of any kind.

365
00:17:17,493 --> 00:17:19,088
Different ages,
different sexes.

366
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:20,861
Different
socio-economic levels.

367
00:17:20,862 --> 00:17:21,923
Different methods of death.

368
00:17:21,924 --> 00:17:24,301
No duplicate weapons,
locations.

369
00:17:24,872 --> 00:17:26,236
Man, what have we got?

370
00:17:26,237 --> 00:17:30,140
First we have a jumper, second, an oven,
third, pills, fourth, carbon monoxide.

371
00:17:31,145 --> 00:17:33,306
They all have to be
connected somehow.

372
00:17:34,681 --> 00:17:36,239
And what I see is
whole lot of nothing.

373
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,943
Nothing.

374
00:17:39,187 --> 00:17:41,484
You see, sometimes, Shawn,
you don't have to dig so deep.

375
00:17:41,485 --> 00:17:44,286
You just need to turn
things upside down

376
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,316
to make them right side up.

377
00:17:49,063 --> 00:17:50,324
And there's your prize.

378
00:17:53,801 --> 00:17:55,290
Wait a minute.

379
00:17:58,906 --> 00:18:00,338
What are you doing?

380
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:04,502
Turning things upside down in
order to make them right side up.

381
00:18:09,216 --> 00:18:10,774
And there's the prize.

382
00:18:14,086 --> 00:18:15,576
This is the prize?

383
00:18:15,577 --> 00:18:17,484
Going to the first dead
guy's place and what?

384
00:18:17,485 --> 00:18:18,545
Talk to a dead guy?

385
00:18:18,546 --> 00:18:20,819
No, we talk to
the dead guy's brother.

386
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,157
The dead guy's brother
lives at the dead guy's place?

387
00:18:23,158 --> 00:18:25,390
They were roommates.
But that's the point.

388
00:18:25,391 --> 00:18:27,160
He's getting rid
of the apartment.

389
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,195
And we're here to rent it.

390
00:18:30,196 --> 00:18:31,668
We're what?

391
00:18:34,206 --> 00:18:36,298
Why can't we for once
just talk to somebody as us?

392
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:38,036
Because, Gus, I don't
want him to be on guard.

393
00:18:38,037 --> 00:18:40,671
If he thinks we're investigating
something, he'll clam up.

394
00:18:42,816 --> 00:18:44,578
Wes Hiltonbock?
Yeah?

395
00:18:44,884 --> 00:18:48,319
Hey, Shawn Spencer. I talked to you
on the phone about the apartment,

396
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,787
and this is Gus. It would
actually be for both of us.

397
00:18:51,724 --> 00:18:53,521
Yeah, okay, come on.

398
00:18:53,826 --> 00:18:55,226
Thanks, man.

399
00:18:59,665 --> 00:19:03,157
Just so you guys know,
the utilities are included,

400
00:19:03,636 --> 00:19:07,537
but I would require first and last
month and a sizable security deposit.

401
00:19:07,538 --> 00:19:10,165
Oh, that's not a problem.
You take cats?

402
00:19:10,843 --> 00:19:12,639
Yeah, I guess so.

403
00:19:13,245 --> 00:19:15,108
You two guys have a cat?

404
00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:18,149
We do, actually.
He's sort of like our child.

405
00:19:19,084 --> 00:19:22,143
I see. How do you guys
know each other?

406
00:19:22,144 --> 00:19:23,654
We're partners.

407
00:19:24,323 --> 00:19:25,481
Got you.

408
00:19:25,482 --> 00:19:29,049
Oh, no, no, no. No, it's fine.
Really, I'm totally fine.

409
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,824
No, we're partners in a
private... Relationship.

410
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,430
Believe it,
it's been a while.

411
00:19:34,431 --> 00:19:36,798
We finish
each other's sentences.

412
00:19:37,202 --> 00:19:38,794
So, tell me, Wes,

413
00:19:39,071 --> 00:19:41,698
why would you want to give
up such a handsome apartment?

414
00:19:41,699 --> 00:19:44,367
Do you...
Do you not like it anymore?

415
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,504
Ooh, Gus,

416
00:19:49,714 --> 00:19:52,205
good news, shower for two.

417
00:19:56,521 --> 00:19:59,887
Actually I just have some bad
memories here. I used to...

418
00:19:59,888 --> 00:20:02,323
I used to live here with my
brother, but he passed away.

419
00:20:02,324 --> 00:20:04,987
Oh, I'm sorry, man.
Was he sick, or...

420
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,562
He killed himself.
Oh, good Lord.

421
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:09,731
I'm so sorry.

422
00:20:09,732 --> 00:20:12,064
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Yeah, me, too.

423
00:20:12,971 --> 00:20:14,597
We were real close,
you know.

424
00:20:16,206 --> 00:20:19,767
God, was he depressed? I mean,
were there signs? Did you...

425
00:20:20,044 --> 00:20:23,274
What am I... I'm sorry, you don't
have to answer those questions.

426
00:20:23,275 --> 00:20:24,024
No.

427
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,174
Actually, I had no idea
anything was wrong, you know.

428
00:20:28,175 --> 00:20:30,687
I mean,
he had so much to live for.

429
00:20:31,054 --> 00:20:32,885
He was a great guy,
you know.

430
00:20:32,886 --> 00:20:35,186
Smarter than me,
more talented.

431
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,557
He was a great singer.

432
00:20:38,562 --> 00:20:40,325
He was really going places.

433
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,767
So look, are you guys... You
guys interested in the place or...

434
00:20:45,768 --> 00:20:47,463
What do you think, honey?

435
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,765
I think it's great.
I think it's perfect.

436
00:20:50,766 --> 00:20:54,470
All right, then. Well, I got another
couple coming by a little later so...

437
00:20:54,745 --> 00:20:56,371
But I'll let you guys know
either way.

438
00:20:56,372 --> 00:20:57,706
Shower for two?

439
00:20:57,707 --> 00:20:59,543
That was so I could see
your face when I said it.

440
00:20:59,544 --> 00:21:01,742
You know, you enjoy these
things more than you should.

441
00:21:01,743 --> 00:21:04,446
I suffered through that for
no reason. We learned nothing.

442
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:07,082
Yes, but I grabbed this
while we were up there.

443
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,486
You took his mail?

444
00:21:08,487 --> 00:21:11,184
<i>It's not like I took his Sports
Illustrated. Dude, it's a phone bill.</i>

445
00:21:11,185 --> 00:21:13,956
You can't open someone else's mail,
Shawn. It's a federal offense.

446
00:21:13,957 --> 00:21:15,725
Gus, he's dead.
So what?

447
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,867
Well, maybe I'll hold it to my
head and read it psychically.

448
00:21:19,868 --> 00:21:21,960
Hurry up, Shawn.
Gus, who's gonna see us?

449
00:21:21,961 --> 00:21:23,300
Hurry up.

450
00:21:25,207 --> 00:21:26,605
Wait, there's like...

451
00:21:26,606 --> 00:21:29,543
There's like 16 calls here
to some 1-800 stress line.

452
00:21:30,313 --> 00:21:31,677
Including the last call
he made.

453
00:21:31,678 --> 00:21:33,304
I've seen the ads for that.
So what?

454
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:35,246
A depressed guy
calls a stress line.

455
00:21:35,247 --> 00:21:37,148
And I bet you a hungry guy
calls a pizza place.

456
00:21:37,149 --> 00:21:38,446
That doesn't
tell us anything.

457
00:21:38,447 --> 00:21:40,317
Yeah, but it might
give us a link.

458
00:21:40,318 --> 00:21:42,185
I'm gonna run the other
victims' phone records.

459
00:21:42,186 --> 00:21:45,386
With what? Your do-it-yourself
phone record running kit?

460
00:21:45,795 --> 00:21:47,227
The next best thing.

461
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:53,066
The answer is in
the phone bills.

462
00:21:53,636 --> 00:21:55,500
I need you to run
the victims' phone records.

463
00:21:55,501 --> 00:21:56,831
What, no cat this time?

464
00:21:56,832 --> 00:21:58,304
Julie, I'm very serious
about this.

465
00:21:58,305 --> 00:22:00,603
I have a strong sense
about a stress line

466
00:22:00,604 --> 00:22:02,608
and I know the link
is in the phone records.

467
00:22:02,609 --> 00:22:06,135
I don't know why you would think I
would do something like this for you.

468
00:22:06,136 --> 00:22:07,841
Some have said it's the hair.

469
00:22:07,842 --> 00:22:09,816
Really? Who says that?

470
00:22:10,251 --> 00:22:12,514
Oh, guess what? We already
ran the phone records

471
00:22:12,515 --> 00:22:13,746
and checked out
the dry-cleaning.

472
00:22:13,747 --> 00:22:16,654
Turns out the pantsuits were
picked up over a week ago.

473
00:22:16,655 --> 00:22:18,692
What kind of dog and pony
show do you think we run here?

474
00:22:18,693 --> 00:22:20,729
Gus, you wanna
take this one? No.

475
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:23,820
Let me put an end to this
non-case right now, okay?

476
00:22:23,821 --> 00:22:26,092
Yes, all the victims
called the 1-800 stress line.

477
00:22:26,093 --> 00:22:27,997
Not just once,
many times over.

478
00:22:27,998 --> 00:22:30,263
Detective Lassiter and I
have combed everything.

479
00:22:30,264 --> 00:22:32,601
We've gone to the bone on
these. All the way to the bone?

480
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:34,732
I know this is hard
for you to grasp,

481
00:22:34,733 --> 00:22:37,641
but these people did have something
in common. They were troubled

482
00:22:37,642 --> 00:22:39,144
and they were depressed,

483
00:22:39,145 --> 00:22:43,081
and as sad as that is, they all
committed suicide. Case closed.

484
00:22:43,684 --> 00:22:45,652
We've clearly
wasted your time.

485
00:22:50,457 --> 00:22:52,118
It's not over, is it?
Of course not.

486
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:55,025
They all called the same help line and
they all killed themselves? Come on!

487
00:22:55,026 --> 00:22:57,563
Shawn, that's what
stressed people do.

488
00:22:59,267 --> 00:23:01,495
Strange how
he gave up so easily.

489
00:23:01,496 --> 00:23:03,092
Yeah, it is.

490
00:23:03,837 --> 00:23:06,271
Maybe we should take a closer
look at that stress line.

491
00:23:07,242 --> 00:23:09,003
Gloria Starks
only called that line

492
00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:10,804
'cause she was stressed
about an audition.

493
00:23:10,805 --> 00:23:14,040
You call a help line and they find
you dead? That's not very helpful.

494
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:17,605
What if someone there is killing the
callers and making it look like suicide?

495
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:21,051
Gus, we go to the stress line,
I think we solve the case.

496
00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:23,051
Come on.

497
00:23:29,329 --> 00:23:30,626
Ta-da!

498
00:23:31,298 --> 00:23:32,422
What is this?

499
00:23:32,423 --> 00:23:35,057
<i>You're looking at our
new business. Mazel tov.</i>

500
00:23:35,058 --> 00:23:38,001
Are you out of your mind? You
rented office space for this?

501
00:23:38,002 --> 00:23:41,165
Gus, don't be a crazy
hooligan. I rented a sign.

502
00:23:47,747 --> 00:23:50,147
Now, let's go say hello
to our new neighbors.

503
00:23:55,756 --> 00:23:57,347
Hello, everyone!

504
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:59,783
Who wants pineapple?
Be honest.

505
00:24:00,793 --> 00:24:02,987
Ah, you guys can slice it
up, fight over it later.

506
00:24:02,988 --> 00:24:05,029
I'm sorry, gentlemen,
may I help you?

507
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:07,462
I'm Terrance,
I run the line here.

508
00:24:07,463 --> 00:24:08,726
Terrance, hello.

509
00:24:08,727 --> 00:24:12,327
I'm Shawn Spencer, this is my
partner Gus "Silly Pants" Jackson.

510
00:24:12,328 --> 00:24:14,133
Just came by
to say hello.

511
00:24:14,134 --> 00:24:17,107
We've opened up our own little
1-800 thingy down the hall.

512
00:24:17,108 --> 00:24:19,872
Not as big as you guys.
More of a closet, really.

513
00:24:20,513 --> 00:24:22,309
Your own 1-800 thingy, huh?

514
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:25,178
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's called Dial-A-Psychic.

515
00:24:25,179 --> 00:24:26,409
Maybe you recognize us.

516
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:29,455
I am the lead psychic for the
Santa Barbara police department.

517
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:33,990
McCallum murders.

518
00:24:36,428 --> 00:24:37,690
Edmond robberies?

519
00:24:37,691 --> 00:24:40,287
Over there, you? Nothing?
Nothing? Wow, really.

520
00:24:40,288 --> 00:24:41,730
What, do you guys
live in this room?

521
00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:48,170
So, you can know stuff about
me just by looking at me?

522
00:24:48,171 --> 00:24:49,602
Yeah, pretty much.

523
00:24:49,603 --> 00:24:51,198
Do it.
Do it?

524
00:24:51,443 --> 00:24:53,206
Go ahead, show us.

525
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:55,443
Looking for a little demo.

526
00:24:55,444 --> 00:24:57,004
Well, for one,
they don't like pineapple.

527
00:24:58,674 --> 00:25:01,980
I don't know guys. I don't think Big
T wants us to take up any more...

528
00:25:01,981 --> 00:25:03,883
Oh, no, no, no.
Go right ahead.

529
00:25:03,884 --> 00:25:06,684
Half the lines are down, phones
are being worked on right now.

530
00:25:06,685 --> 00:25:08,783
We have time for your
little trick. Oh, yeah?

531
00:25:12,964 --> 00:25:14,794
Let's see what I
can come up with.

532
00:25:25,677 --> 00:25:29,271
Loose flowing stanzas,
Bobby Frost.

533
00:25:30,681 --> 00:25:32,272
Are you a poet, by chance?

534
00:25:32,273 --> 00:25:33,749
Yeah! Yeah, I am!

535
00:25:34,841 --> 00:25:36,511
Wow. How did you know that?

536
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:39,556
I guess you could say
I'm a bit of a psychic poet.

537
00:25:40,724 --> 00:25:42,282
Oh, please, stop.

538
00:25:44,094 --> 00:25:46,994
'Cause I'm like,
I'm freaking out here!

539
00:25:46,995 --> 00:25:48,257
Do you see his eyeliner?

540
00:25:48,258 --> 00:25:50,323
Guy could be the drummer
from The Cure.

541
00:25:55,906 --> 00:25:59,740
Wow, I can see why you come out
here to eat. It's beautiful.

542
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:03,840
Sound of the seagulls, the smell
of the ocean, the salt air...

543
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,378
Hmm. I never noticed.

544
00:26:07,384 --> 00:26:08,440
What do you got there?

545
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:09,712
What you asked for.

546
00:26:09,713 --> 00:26:12,654
I ran the sheets on all the
volunteers at the stress line.

547
00:26:13,057 --> 00:26:15,457
Do you mind?
It's police business.

548
00:26:17,227 --> 00:26:18,488
Scram.

549
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:22,097
Let's see what we got here.

550
00:26:22,533 --> 00:26:24,397
Well, lookie there.

551
00:26:25,336 --> 00:26:26,824
It's a picture
of an old friend.

552
00:26:26,825 --> 00:26:27,893
Hmm.

553
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:33,308
Hey, Rory.

554
00:26:43,586 --> 00:26:44,916
Where the hell
have you been?

555
00:26:44,917 --> 00:26:46,352
I've been sitting
on this mop bucket

556
00:26:46,353 --> 00:26:49,413
in this tiny closet for the last hour
and a half waiting for you to show up.

557
00:26:49,414 --> 00:26:50,924
I'm all cramped.
Well, get up, man.

558
00:26:50,925 --> 00:26:53,188
Do some pushups or something.
I need you light and limber.

559
00:26:53,189 --> 00:26:56,321
<i>Do some pushups? Sure, like Clint
Eastwood in Escape from Alcatraz.</i>

560
00:26:56,322 --> 00:26:59,265
Sure, he spends the whole movie
in a tiny little cell, right?

561
00:26:59,266 --> 00:27:01,769
But he's in the best shape
of his entire life.

562
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,834
Give me a little
piece of tape.

563
00:27:04,835 --> 00:27:06,635
What happened to
the big ticking time clock?

564
00:27:06,636 --> 00:27:09,109
Gus, what do you think
I've been doing all day?

565
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:17,484
My work happens here and here.

566
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,210
What are you doing?

567
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:23,318
I am trying to create a
pleasant work environment.

568
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:26,292
I can tell by looking at your
little area that you don't care.

569
00:27:26,293 --> 00:27:27,452
We don't work here, Shawn.

570
00:27:27,453 --> 00:27:28,825
We do until
we solve these murders.

571
00:27:28,826 --> 00:27:30,363
But don't worry,
I have a plan.

572
00:27:30,364 --> 00:27:32,956
You are gonna call the stress
line and pretend to be depressed.

573
00:27:32,957 --> 00:27:34,262
No, I'm not.
Yes.

574
00:27:34,263 --> 00:27:36,166
And I will go down the hall
when you make the call,

575
00:27:36,167 --> 00:27:38,262
ask for Rory, so that
I can see him in action.

576
00:27:38,263 --> 00:27:39,431
Why don't you call him?

577
00:27:39,432 --> 00:27:41,031
Gus, please be serious
for one second.

578
00:27:41,032 --> 00:27:42,769
No one's gonna believe
that I'm depressed. Come on.

579
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:45,038
I got an idea. Why don't you
have the cat make the call?

580
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,637
He's like your new partner,
right? Where is he, anyway?

581
00:27:47,638 --> 00:27:50,275
Gus, he's far more comfortable
in your car.

582
00:27:50,276 --> 00:27:53,649
Plus, I need him well rested for
when he identifies the killer.

583
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:57,488
Now, wait exactly two seconds
and then make the call.

584
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,692
Oh! I have no idea
what I'd even say.

585
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,462
Here's a good opener.
"Hello, my name's Gus.

586
00:28:03,463 --> 00:28:06,329
"I have a deep-seated jealousy
for a tiny little boy cat."

587
00:28:09,837 --> 00:28:11,565
Why would you put them
on speakerphone?

588
00:28:11,566 --> 00:28:13,469
See, because I think
that tends to undercut...

589
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:16,408
Big T! Look sharp!

590
00:28:18,979 --> 00:28:20,446
What is it now, Mr. Spencer?

591
00:28:20,447 --> 00:28:22,242
Just wanted to pick
your brain for a second.

592
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:23,907
How many lines
you got going here?

593
00:28:23,908 --> 00:28:26,918
I have 12 lines, but I'm
adding more all the time.

594
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:30,081
I get it, I get it, the more
lines, the more green, am I right?

595
00:28:30,624 --> 00:28:33,354
I'm a non-profit operation.
The calls are free.

596
00:28:33,961 --> 00:28:35,392
I'm not in this for the money.

597
00:28:35,393 --> 00:28:36,862
Really, that's weird.

598
00:28:37,264 --> 00:28:39,664
See, I'm thinking of
charging four bucks a minute.

599
00:28:43,704 --> 00:28:45,033
Rory.

600
00:28:45,034 --> 00:28:46,471
Rory!

601
00:28:50,009 --> 00:28:51,204
Hey, Ror.

602
00:28:52,012 --> 00:28:54,411
Hey. You really do
love your music, huh?

603
00:28:54,412 --> 00:28:56,449
You kidding?
Music inspires me.

604
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:59,452
Yeah, you know, you don't
really strike me as the...

605
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,949
Charitable type? I was gonna
say sensitive, but sure.

606
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,251
Actually, I'm here as
part of a community service

607
00:29:05,252 --> 00:29:07,224
on this assault beef,
you know.

608
00:29:07,225 --> 00:29:11,228
I got into it with this guy
who didn't like my poetry.

609
00:29:11,229 --> 00:29:13,662
So, 250 hours.

610
00:29:13,663 --> 00:29:15,894
Two-fifty,
wow, that's intense.

611
00:29:18,538 --> 00:29:21,268
Rory, that's Line 6!

612
00:29:22,475 --> 00:29:24,305
I'll let you get
back to work. Sorry.

613
00:29:28,348 --> 00:29:29,780
Hello, Stressline,

614
00:29:29,781 --> 00:29:32,545
the extra S is for
extra stress. This is Rory.

615
00:29:33,486 --> 00:29:34,679
Uh-huh.

616
00:29:36,455 --> 00:29:39,288
Right, so you're experiencing
some stress.

617
00:29:41,193 --> 00:29:42,786
Career and personal?

618
00:29:43,363 --> 00:29:45,160
Well, yeah, I suppose.

619
00:29:45,598 --> 00:29:48,465
I mean my career's not exactly
where I would like it to be.

620
00:29:49,034 --> 00:29:51,525
No. No, I don't have
a girlfriend right now.

621
00:29:52,538 --> 00:29:53,937
It's been awhile.

622
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,400
Right.

623
00:29:59,444 --> 00:30:01,071
Right, that's not good.

624
00:30:02,581 --> 00:30:05,175
Does it make you
have dark thoughts?

625
00:30:06,952 --> 00:30:09,182
Like how dark are you talking?

626
00:30:09,721 --> 00:30:10,982
Like, "wanna be dead" dark?

627
00:30:10,983 --> 00:30:13,147
Okay, easy,
I just wanna say this,

628
00:30:13,148 --> 00:30:17,354
like, right off the bat,
suicide is not the answer.

629
00:30:17,355 --> 00:30:19,191
Who said anything
about suicide?

630
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,993
I just said maybe I should find a
new hobby, like coin collecting.

631
00:30:21,994 --> 00:30:23,464
Or something
at the beach.

632
00:30:23,465 --> 00:30:25,024
I like water activities.

633
00:30:25,025 --> 00:30:26,297
Like drowning?

634
00:30:26,939 --> 00:30:28,667
What? Drowning?

635
00:30:28,907 --> 00:30:30,133
I don't want to drown!

636
00:30:30,134 --> 00:30:31,800
No, no, of course you don't.

637
00:30:31,801 --> 00:30:33,399
That's awful, okay?

638
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,910
But I don't care
what you say about

639
00:30:35,911 --> 00:30:38,244
suicide in a lake
being poetic,

640
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:41,142
you know, like,
your body floating to the top

641
00:30:41,143 --> 00:30:44,245
of the pristine, serene waters

642
00:30:44,246 --> 00:30:46,688
<i>and your final breaths
rippling out in</i>

643
00:30:46,689 --> 00:30:49,919
an ever-widening circle, you
know, like the circle of life.

644
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,359
But you have to stop
that kind of thinking.

645
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,363
You have so much to live for.

646
00:30:54,364 --> 00:30:56,797
You're damn straight,
I have a lot to live for!

647
00:30:56,798 --> 00:30:58,266
Of course you do.

648
00:30:58,267 --> 00:31:01,737
You see, I can tell, this phone
call is helping you already.

649
00:31:06,943 --> 00:31:08,137
Dude, what the hell was that?

650
00:31:08,138 --> 00:31:10,475
Was he trying to help me? Cause I
feel really creeped out right now.

651
00:31:10,476 --> 00:31:11,808
Dude, he put you
on the creepy train

652
00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:14,281
headed for Creep Island where
the natives drink creep nectar

653
00:31:14,282 --> 00:31:16,784
out of creepy coconut
shells... Shawn, it's horrible.

654
00:31:16,785 --> 00:31:18,684
Yeah, I'm sorry.
He's nuts, Shawn.

655
00:31:18,685 --> 00:31:19,880
Yes.
And worst of all,

656
00:31:19,881 --> 00:31:21,321
he actually made
some good points!

657
00:31:21,322 --> 00:31:23,655
I mean, pharmaceutical
sales, not sexy.

658
00:31:23,656 --> 00:31:25,193
You are my only
non-work friend.

659
00:31:25,194 --> 00:31:26,853
There's got to be
something wrong with that.

660
00:31:26,854 --> 00:31:28,420
Hey, hey, hey,
what is this?

661
00:31:28,421 --> 00:31:29,795
What?

662
00:31:30,768 --> 00:31:32,166
Hang in there.

663
00:31:32,369 --> 00:31:34,893
He's right, I need to start
taking some more risks.

664
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:36,995
Does that mean we can go
cliff diving in Zihuatanejo?

665
00:31:36,996 --> 00:31:38,335
No. I'm being serious, Shawn!

666
00:31:38,336 --> 00:31:40,842
Look, would it make you feel any
better if I told you Hiltonbock called?

667
00:31:40,843 --> 00:31:42,844
We got the apartment! What
would make me feel better

668
00:31:42,845 --> 00:31:45,506
is if we called the police!
This guy is dangerous, Shawn.

669
00:31:45,507 --> 00:31:47,208
Let's call Vick.
Maybe get him arrested.

670
00:31:47,209 --> 00:31:48,751
Gus, Gus!
What?

671
00:31:49,719 --> 00:31:53,051
The only thing this guy is guilty
of right now is being a bad poet.

672
00:31:53,052 --> 00:31:54,987
You know how this game works.

673
00:31:54,988 --> 00:31:58,084
We cannot just pick up a phone and
beg the police to come and save us.

674
00:31:59,996 --> 00:32:01,257
Look, just...

675
00:32:01,258 --> 00:32:03,730
Just stay away
from the water for now.

676
00:32:04,234 --> 00:32:06,395
Final decision, we wait.

677
00:32:15,577 --> 00:32:16,976
No, it's this way.

678
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:18,104
You sure?
Yes.

679
00:32:19,215 --> 00:32:20,681
Now, was that so hard?

680
00:32:26,655 --> 00:32:28,748
Maybe you'd care
to explain this.

681
00:32:31,026 --> 00:32:32,515
My eyeliner pencil?

682
00:32:32,516 --> 00:32:34,586
So, you admit it's yours.

683
00:32:36,165 --> 00:32:38,291
Funny how Gloria Starks'
suicide note

684
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:40,698
was scrawled across her
windshield in black eyeliner.

685
00:32:40,699 --> 00:32:43,236
Yet no eyeliner was found
at the crime scene.

686
00:32:43,237 --> 00:32:45,466
You, my friend,
are looking at exhibit A.

687
00:32:46,475 --> 00:32:47,874
Bag it, O'Hara.

688
00:32:48,978 --> 00:32:50,968
You like your music,
don't you, Rory?

689
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:54,345
Yeah, I do.
It's my inspiration.

690
00:32:55,016 --> 00:32:56,177
I bet.

691
00:32:57,753 --> 00:32:59,446
I bet it inspires you to kill.

692
00:32:59,447 --> 00:33:00,782
That's why you
couldn't resist

693
00:33:00,783 --> 00:33:04,381
playing your big-haired, drug-induced
death music on Mortimer Tilden's stereo

694
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:06,290
while you forced him
to swallow all those pills.

695
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:07,850
Or on Gloria Starks'
car radio

696
00:33:07,851 --> 00:33:09,725
while she slipped into
unconsciousness.

697
00:33:09,726 --> 00:33:11,628
And even now.

698
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,391
Let's have a little listen,
shall we?

699
00:33:22,877 --> 00:33:25,174
What, you think you can
pull a fast one on me

700
00:33:25,175 --> 00:33:28,215
switching out your head-thrashing
crap for this noise?

701
00:33:30,151 --> 00:33:33,177
This crap is
all I listen to.

702
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,248
I hate metal music.

703
00:33:35,823 --> 00:33:38,313
I use the details
that I get from callers

704
00:33:38,314 --> 00:33:40,189
to write better poems.

705
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:42,160
I am not a killer!

706
00:33:42,161 --> 00:33:44,390
Yeah, I know,
you're a poet,

707
00:33:44,391 --> 00:33:46,328
but you're also an assaulter,
aren't you?

708
00:33:46,329 --> 00:33:48,925
Who do you think arrested you
on that assault charge?

709
00:33:58,712 --> 00:34:00,805
Oh, a guy from the phone
company found the victim.

710
00:34:07,422 --> 00:34:09,411
I didn't kill anybody.

711
00:34:09,412 --> 00:34:11,684
Get him out of my sight.

712
00:34:17,664 --> 00:34:19,860
What?
You're not taking notes?

713
00:34:23,403 --> 00:34:24,892
How could you
let him do that?

714
00:34:24,893 --> 00:34:27,768
Now Lassiter gets credit for solving
the crime and we won't get paid.

715
00:34:27,769 --> 00:34:29,775
Oh, we're gonna get paid.
How do you figure?

716
00:34:29,975 --> 00:34:31,806
Lassiter didn't
solve the crime.

717
00:34:31,807 --> 00:34:33,276
Rory is innocent.
He didn't do it.

718
00:34:33,277 --> 00:34:34,743
He didn't?
No.

719
00:34:34,744 --> 00:34:36,214
Then who did?

720
00:34:37,746 --> 00:34:41,345
Just grip the spike with your
little foot and climb! Come on!

721
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:46,321
Why do I gotta go first?

722
00:34:46,322 --> 00:34:50,122
'Cause you're a climbing machine,
Gus. Just, you know, be careful.

723
00:34:50,123 --> 00:34:53,094
Grip the spike with your
foot! Okay, oh, okay, okay.

724
00:35:01,274 --> 00:35:02,467
Grease.

725
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:09,137
Dude, dude! Dude,
I know who the killer is!

726
00:35:09,138 --> 00:35:11,114
Can I come down then?
No, no, stay up there.

727
00:35:11,115 --> 00:35:13,173
I have to figure out where
he's headed. Who is it?

728
00:35:13,174 --> 00:35:14,741
Well, put it this way,

729
00:35:14,742 --> 00:35:16,878
I don't think taking the
apartment is such a good idea,

730
00:35:16,879 --> 00:35:18,854
unless you think it's cool
that our would-be landlord

731
00:35:18,855 --> 00:35:21,153
is a serial killer.
Hiltonbock?

732
00:35:21,154 --> 00:35:22,625
There was a pattern.

733
00:35:22,626 --> 00:35:24,958
See, all the murders
coincide with dates

734
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:27,020
that Hiltonbock was
servicing the phone lines.

735
00:35:27,021 --> 00:35:28,792
That's when he had access.
With this?

736
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,529
Yes. Yeah, yeah,
send that down.

737
00:35:34,874 --> 00:35:36,101
Perfect!

738
00:35:36,541 --> 00:35:39,065
See, this device stores all the
incoming and outgoing calls.

739
00:35:39,066 --> 00:35:41,077
My guess is that wherever
number he dialed last,

740
00:35:41,078 --> 00:35:42,545
that's where
Hiltonbock is headed.

741
00:35:42,546 --> 00:35:44,879
And whoever that is,
is probably his next victim.

742
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:48,410
<i>Hello, you've reached Buzz McNab.</i>

743
00:35:48,411 --> 00:35:50,680
<i>I'm not in right now, but
please do leave a message</i>

744
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:52,747
<i>and I will get back to you
when I get in.</i>

745
00:35:53,725 --> 00:35:54,988
Oh, no.

746
00:35:57,295 --> 00:35:58,660
Who are you calling?

747
00:36:02,668 --> 00:36:05,396
Hello, Chief?
Hey, Shawn Spencer here.

748
00:36:05,397 --> 00:36:08,633
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, I'm getting
a vibe right now as big as a Buick!

749
00:36:17,015 --> 00:36:18,607
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
no, you don't.

750
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:20,276
Stay, boy cat!

751
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:42,868
Hey, McNab,
so this is the place, huh?

752
00:36:43,942 --> 00:36:45,408
It's nice. It's really nice.

753
00:36:45,842 --> 00:36:47,433
Drop it!
Don't come any closer.

754
00:36:47,434 --> 00:36:48,534
Put it down
or I will drop you!

755
00:36:48,535 --> 00:36:50,078
I swear to God
I'm gonna shoot him.

756
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,943
Drop it! Everybody
breathe, just breathe!

757
00:36:51,944 --> 00:36:53,106
Get out of here.

758
00:36:53,107 --> 00:36:55,377
Well, the other ones must have
gone a lot smoother than this,

759
00:36:55,378 --> 00:36:56,817
huh, Hiltonbock?

760
00:36:57,154 --> 00:36:59,314
Though, comparatively,
it was probably pretty easy

761
00:36:59,315 --> 00:37:01,651
to get Mortimer Tilden
to swallow those pills.

762
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,818
You wanna die, old man, huh?
Eat them!

763
00:37:04,595 --> 00:37:08,155
Because you are not really
a cold-blooded serial killer.

764
00:37:08,156 --> 00:37:10,893
Are you? No, but he threw his
own brother off a building!

765
00:37:10,894 --> 00:37:12,195
I didn't push him
off the roof.

766
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:14,669
No, no, no. No, you didn't.
You didn't do that.

767
00:37:15,505 --> 00:37:17,233
<i>But you were there.
You saw it.</i>

768
00:37:17,234 --> 00:37:19,900
You saw the whole thing. You
saw him jump off the balcony

769
00:37:19,901 --> 00:37:22,274
of the apartment that
you shared. He was weak.

770
00:37:22,275 --> 00:37:24,778
There's a lot of weak people
out there, Hiltonbock.

771
00:37:24,779 --> 00:37:27,143
Are you gonna track them all
down, huh, one at a time?

772
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:29,376
Punish them
for their weakness?

773
00:37:29,377 --> 00:37:31,214
You wanna get back
at your brother so badly,

774
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:33,447
you don't even care
who these people were,

775
00:37:33,448 --> 00:37:34,818
just that
they called the line.

776
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:36,550
And look, you're gonna kill
McNab here just because

777
00:37:36,551 --> 00:37:37,991
he had a few
pre-wedding jitters.

778
00:37:37,992 --> 00:37:40,789
I was just
looking for a little advice.

779
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:42,558
Nobody else would talk to me.

780
00:37:45,801 --> 00:37:48,633
It's okay, Buzz.
We all have stress.

781
00:37:48,634 --> 00:37:50,738
All of us.
Right here in this room.

782
00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:53,741
I mean, take a good look,
Hiltonbock. We all have problems.

783
00:37:54,143 --> 00:37:56,475
Who else deserves
to get shot or hung?

784
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,012
Maybe it's Gus.

785
00:37:59,013 --> 00:38:01,345
That's enough, Spencer.
No. Shoot him.

786
00:38:01,584 --> 00:38:02,947
What are you doing?

787
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,645
Yeah, maybe I should.

788
00:38:04,646 --> 00:38:06,084
Don't listen to him.

789
00:38:06,085 --> 00:38:07,916
He's a crazy person,
he's crazy.

790
00:38:07,917 --> 00:38:09,981
That's right, I am crazy.

791
00:38:10,892 --> 00:38:12,586
So maybe
you should shoot me.

792
00:38:12,587 --> 00:38:13,959
Okay.

793
00:38:15,297 --> 00:38:18,288
Here's the best part. It
doesn't matter what I think,

794
00:38:18,289 --> 00:38:20,960
because you have a problem
that's a lot bigger than me.

795
00:38:22,337 --> 00:38:23,634
This guy.

796
00:38:24,507 --> 00:38:27,804
The man with his gun trained on
you is not only a fine human being,

797
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,740
with a strong Irish hairline,

798
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:32,278
he is an exemplary
public servant

799
00:38:32,279 --> 00:38:34,906
and arguably the finest
detective mind

800
00:38:34,907 --> 00:38:38,680
in the lower western
Santa Barbara County area

801
00:38:39,421 --> 00:38:41,048
over the age of 35.

802
00:38:41,756 --> 00:38:43,882
And right now,
while I'm speaking,

803
00:38:43,883 --> 00:38:46,255
he is devising a swift
and stealth-like tactic

804
00:38:46,256 --> 00:38:48,353
that is going to disarm you

805
00:38:49,263 --> 00:38:51,391
and blow your freaking mind!

806
00:38:59,406 --> 00:39:01,204
Anytime you're ready.

807
00:39:03,478 --> 00:39:05,275
All right,
we gotta make the move.

808
00:39:13,021 --> 00:39:14,715
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

809
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:23,253
That was adequate, Spencer.

810
00:39:23,254 --> 00:39:24,854
Don't thank me.

811
00:39:25,432 --> 00:39:26,899
Thank the little boy cat.

812
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,164
There you are.

813
00:39:36,043 --> 00:39:37,772
There's my big guy.

814
00:39:38,779 --> 00:39:41,008
There's my big guy.
You are a hero.

815
00:39:41,009 --> 00:39:43,310
You are a hero today. Yes.

816
00:39:44,818 --> 00:39:48,014
Speaking of heroes, McNab,
I was gonna get you

817
00:39:48,221 --> 00:39:50,121
something off
the registry online,

818
00:39:50,122 --> 00:39:52,816
but it turns out the Chief already
got you the asparagus steamer.

819
00:39:52,817 --> 00:39:56,556
So, instead I give you
this little guy.

820
00:39:58,798 --> 00:39:59,925
Yeah.

821
00:40:05,438 --> 00:40:09,932
If you take him in the car, he
likes to ride upfront, shotgun.

822
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,240
You know, there's
something beautiful

823
00:40:20,241 --> 00:40:22,411
about the color
Fruity Puffs turns the milk.

824
00:40:22,412 --> 00:40:25,320
I think it's the most beautiful
thing in the whole world.

825
00:40:25,321 --> 00:40:27,187
You know, I've been thinking.

826
00:40:27,188 --> 00:40:29,250
You're not the only one who
lives a charmed life, Shawn.

827
00:40:29,251 --> 00:40:30,453
I got it pretty good, too.

828
00:40:30,454 --> 00:40:33,396
Yes, you do, and it makes
me glad to hear you say so.

829
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:35,194
I mean,
the other day at work,

830
00:40:35,195 --> 00:40:37,565
this dermatologist,
Katie Finestatt,

831
00:40:37,566 --> 00:40:39,603
commented how I
looked handsome

832
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:41,536
carrying my sample case
into her office.

833
00:40:41,537 --> 00:40:43,301
Finestatt said that?
Yes, she did.

834
00:40:43,302 --> 00:40:44,967
And she is fine.

835
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,674
So, it got me thinking,

836
00:40:48,675 --> 00:40:51,977
maybe pharmaceutical sales
can be sort of sexy.

837
00:40:51,978 --> 00:40:53,983
There are times when I have
to stand a few feet away

838
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:55,576
because you're
literally sizzling.

839
00:40:55,577 --> 00:40:57,644
You see what I'm saying?
I mean,

840
00:40:57,645 --> 00:41:01,056
you may be my only non-work
friend, but you're my best friend.

841
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,421
And how many best friends
does one guy need, really?

842
00:41:04,422 --> 00:41:05,963
That's my point.

843
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:08,499
It's all in the
attitude, Gus. Exactly.

844
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,330
Not sweating the small stuff.

845
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:12,826
Life is too short.

846
00:41:12,827 --> 00:41:14,132
Too short.

847
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:16,566
Changing my attitude, Shawn.

848
00:41:24,516 --> 00:41:26,313
Where the hell is my prize?

849
00:41:26,685 --> 00:41:28,914
Where's my ring, Shawn?
Easy now.

850
00:41:28,915 --> 00:41:31,180
No, no, I've timed the
bowls out perfectly, Shawn.

851
00:41:31,181 --> 00:41:33,952
Me, then you, then me, then
you, then I get the prize!

852
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:36,824
What happened to "Not
sweating the small stuff?

853
00:41:36,825 --> 00:41:39,021
"Life's too short,"
all that?

854
00:41:40,198 --> 00:41:41,664
Did you open
the bottom of the box?

855
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,859
Now, why would I do
something like that?

856
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,200
That's my ring.

857
00:41:46,972 --> 00:41:48,699
You know I would kill
for that ring, don't you?

858
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,103
Oh, you're upsetting me.

859
00:41:50,104 --> 00:41:53,142
You just changed my mood from an
orangey yellow to a muddy brown.

860
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:55,371
You need to say
something sweet. Quick.

861
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:00,112
Gus!

862
00:42:00,113 --> 00:42:03,516
That's so childish.

863
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:09,422
I'm gonna eat yours!

864
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:22,062
<i>In between the lines
there's a lot of obscurity</i>

865
00:42:22,063 --> 00:42:25,574
<i>I'm not inclined
to resign to maturity</i>

866
00:42:25,575 --> 00:42:28,873
<i>If it's all right
then you're all wrong</i>

867
00:42:28,874 --> 00:42:32,403
<i>But why bounce around
to the same damn song?</i>

868
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:37,747
<i>You'd rather run
when you can't crawl</i>

869
00:42:39,889 --> 00:42:43,325
<i>I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth</i>

870
00:42:43,326 --> 00:42:46,452
<i>I know, you know
They just don't have any proof</i>

871
00:42:46,453 --> 00:42:49,691
<i>Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend</i>

872
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:53,792
<i>Your worst inhibitions tend
to psych you out in the end</i>

873
00:42:53,793 --> 00:42:55,633
<i>I know, you know</i>

874
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:59,272
<i>I know, you know</i>
