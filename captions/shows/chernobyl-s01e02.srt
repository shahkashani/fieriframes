175
00:12:33,873 --> 00:12:35,713
I will allow it.

176
00:12:44,748 --> 00:12:46,668
Legasov:
Um...

177
00:12:48,164 --> 00:12:50,964
An RBMK reactor

178
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:55,249
uses uranium 235 as fuel.

179
00:12:55,331 --> 00:13:00,121
Every atom of U-235
is like a bullet

180
00:13:00,206 --> 00:13:02,326
traveling at nearly
the speed of light,

181
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,924
penetrating everything
in its path:

182
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:08,117
woods, metal, concrete, flesh.

183
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:11,286
Every gram of U-235 holds

184
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:14,253
over a billion trillion
of these bullets.

185
00:13:14,331 --> 00:13:15,791
That's in one gram.

186
00:13:15,873 --> 00:13:19,163
Now, Chernobyl holds
over three million grams,

187
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:21,867
and right now, it is on fire.

188
00:13:21,956 --> 00:13:26,286
Winds will carry
radioactive particles
across the entire continent,

189
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:28,293
rain will bring them down on us.

190
00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:31,463
That's three million
billion trillion bullets

191
00:13:31,539 --> 00:13:35,499

192
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:38,831

the food we eat.

193
00:13:40,498 --> 00:13:44,828
Most of these bullets
will not stop firing
for 100 years.

194
00:13:44,915 --> 00:13:48,205
Some of them,
not for 50,000 years.

195
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:51,999
Yes, and, uh, this concern

196
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:56,251
stems entirely from
the description of a rock?

197
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:01,919
Yes.

-Shcherbina:
It's a simple question.

It's hardly
a simple answer.

217
00:15:46,414 --> 00:15:50,334
Of course, you presume
I'm too stupid to understand.

218
00:15:50,414 --> 00:15:53,714

how a nuclear reactor works,

00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,670
or I'll have one of these
soldiers throw you out
of the helicopter.

220
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:10,620
A nuclear reactor makes
electricity with steam.

221
00:16:10,706 --> 00:16:14,246
The steam turns a turbine
which generates electricity.

222
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:16,291
Where a typical power plant

223
00:16:16,373 --> 00:16:18,253
makes steam by burning coal,

224
00:16:18,331 --> 00:16:20,671
a nuclear plant...

225
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:30,411
In a nuclear plant, we use
something called fission.

226
00:16:30,498 --> 00:16:36,458
We take an unstable element
like uranium 235,

227
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:38,499
which has too many neutrons.

228
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:41,411
-A neutron is, uh--
-The bullet.

229
00:16:43,414 --> 00:16:45,214
Yes, the bullet.

230
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:48,869
So, bullets are flying
off of the uranium.

231
00:16:48,956 --> 00:16:50,286
Now...

232
00:16:50,373 --> 00:16:55,213
if we put enough
uranium atoms close together,

233
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:59,669
the bullets from one atom will
eventually strike another atom.

234
00:16:59,748 --> 00:17:02,828
The force of this impact
splits that atom apart,

235
00:17:02,915 --> 00:17:06,205
releasing a tremendous
amount of energy, fission.

236
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:09,039
-And the graphite?
-Ah, yes.

237
00:17:09,122 --> 00:17:13,002
The neutrons are
actually traveling so fast--
we call this "flux"--

238
00:17:13,081 --> 00:17:17,871
it's relatively unlikely
that the uranium atoms
will ever hit one another.

239
00:17:17,956 --> 00:17:22,916
In RBMK reactors, we surround
the fuel rods with graphite

240
00:17:22,997 --> 00:17:27,997
to moderate, slow down,
the neutron flux.

241

Professor Legasov,
I understand

347
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,369
you've been saying
dangerous things.

348
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:41,246
Fomin:
Very dangerous things.

349
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,671
Apparently,
our reactor core exploded.

350
00:25:44,331 --> 00:25:48,581
Please, tell me how an RBMK
reactor core explodes.

351
00:25:50,456 --> 00:25:52,786
I'm not prepared to explain it
at this time.

352
00:25:52,873 --> 00:25:55,753

353
00:25:55,831 --> 00:25:58,331

354

at a time like this.

355
00:26:07,956 --> 00:26:10,666
Why did I see graphite
on the roof?

356
00:26:10,748 --> 00:26:12,868
Graphite is only
found in the core,

357
00:26:12,956 --> 00:26:16,406
where it's used as
a neutron flux moderator.

358
00:26:16,498 --> 00:26:17,918

359
00:26:18,873 --> 00:26:22,333
Fomin, why did
the Deputy Chairman
see graphite on the roof?

360
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:25,371
Well, that... that can't be.

361
00:26:26,247 --> 00:26:28,917
Comrade Shcherbina,
my apologies, but graphite...

362
00:26:28,997 --> 00:26:30,207
that's not possible.

363
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:32,539
Perhaps you saw
burnt concrete.

364
00:26:32,623 --> 00:26:34,413
Now there you made a mistake,

365
00:26:34,498 --> 00:26:37,118
because I may not know much
about nuclear reactors,

366
00:26:37,206 --> 00:26:38,826
but I know a lot
about concrete.

367
00:26:39,665 --> 00:26:42,155
-Comrade, I assure you--
-I understand.

368
00:26:42,997 --> 00:26:45,617
You think Legasov is wrong.

369
00:26:45,706 --> 00:26:47,666
How shall we prove it?

370
00:26:48,956 --> 00:26:52,206
Our high-range dosimeter
just arrived.

371
00:26:52,289 --> 00:26:55,249
We could cover one of our
trucks with lead shielding,

372
00:26:55,331 --> 00:26:57,671
mount the dosimeter
on the front.

373
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:06,666
Have one of your men
get as close to the fire
as he can.

374
00:27:06,748 --> 00:27:08,408
Give him every bit
of protection you have.

375
00:27:08,498 --> 00:27:10,788
But understand that
even with lead shielding,

376
00:27:10,873 --> 00:27:12,873

377

There has been a nuclear

admitted that it happened.

557
00:41:52,414 --> 00:41:53,964
The Soviet version is this:

558
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:55,459
One of the atomic reactors

559
00:41:55,539 --> 00:41:58,119
at the Chernobyl Atomic Power
Plant near the city of Kiev

560
00:41:58,206 --> 00:42:00,786
was damaged, and there is
speculation in Moscow

561
00:42:00,873 --> 00:42:03,083
that people were injured
and may have died.

562
00:42:03,164 --> 00:42:06,294
The Soviets may have been
fairly quick to acknowledge
the accident

563
00:42:06,373 --> 00:42:09,673
because evidence in the form
of mild nuclear radiation

564
00:42:09,748 --> 00:42:13,788
had already reached
beyond the Soviet borders
to Scandinavia.

Smothering the core
will put the fire out,

608

but the temperature will
eventually increase--

609
00:47:37,122 --> 00:47:38,672
Legasov:
Believe me,
I'm perfectly aware.

610
00:47:38,748 --> 00:47:40,788
But I estimate
at least a month

611
00:47:40,873 --> 00:47:42,793
before it melts through
the lower concrete pad,

612
00:47:42,873 --> 00:47:44,793
-which gives us time--
-No, you don't have a month.

613
00:47:44,873 --> 00:47:46,583
You have approximately two days.

614
00:47:47,498 --> 00:47:50,708
Yes, the fuel would
take a month

615
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:52,830
to reach the concrete pad here.

616
00:47:52,915 --> 00:47:56,405
But first...
it's going to burn through

617
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:58,868
the biological shield here
by Tuesday.

618
00:47:58,956 --> 00:48:01,956
And when it does,
it's going to hit these tanks--

619
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:03,329
bubbler pools, reservoirs--

620
00:48:03,414 --> 00:48:06,584
Reservoirs for the ECS.
I understand your concern,

621
00:48:06,665 --> 00:48:08,575
but I confirmed it
with plant personnel.

622
00:48:08,665 --> 00:48:12,245
-The tanks are nearly empty.
-No, they were nearly empty.

623

Each of these points
here, here, and here

624
00:48:15,873 --> 00:48:17,873
all drain
to the bubbler pools.

625
00:48:17,956 --> 00:48:20,496
I'm guessing that every pipe
in the building ruptured.

626
00:48:20,581 --> 00:48:23,541

those fire engines
that I saw on the way in.

are still connected.

636

640
00:49:40,456 --> 00:49:44,866
Professor Legasov
will deliver our briefing.

641
00:49:46,539 --> 00:49:48,039
There is some good news.

642
00:49:48,122 --> 00:49:50,792
The air drops are working
to douse the fire.

643
00:49:50,873 --> 00:49:54,623
There's been a reduction
in radionuclide emissions,

644
00:49:54,706 --> 00:49:56,536
but the fire will not
be extinguished

645
00:49:56,623 --> 00:49:59,503
for at least
another two weeks.

646
00:50:01,414 --> 00:50:04,414
There is also
an additional problem.

647
00:50:05,956 --> 00:50:07,706
Nuclear fuel doesn't turn cold

648
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:10,460
simply because
it is not on fire.

649
00:50:10,539 --> 00:50:12,159
In fact, the temperature
will likely rise

650
00:50:12,247 --> 00:50:14,957
as a result of the blanket
of sand we've dropped.

651
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:17,829
The uranium will melt the sand,

652
00:50:17,915 --> 00:50:19,615
creating a kind of lava

653
00:50:19,706 --> 00:50:22,996
which will begin to melt down
through the shield below.

654
00:50:23,081 --> 00:50:24,621
You have made lava?

655
00:50:27,289 --> 00:50:29,409
I anticipated this.

656
00:50:30,915 --> 00:50:33,205
I believed there was
time to reinforce

657
00:50:33,289 --> 00:50:35,329
this lower concrete pad

658
00:50:35,414 --> 00:50:36,874
before the lava
reached the earth

659
00:50:36,956 --> 00:50:38,496
and contaminated
the groundwater.

660
00:50:38,581 --> 00:50:41,671
But as it turned out, I was
worried about the wrong thing.

661
00:50:41,748 --> 00:50:43,618
Uh, um...

662
00:50:43,706 --> 00:50:47,286
It was my understanding
that these large water tanks

663
00:50:47,373 --> 00:50:49,963
under the reactor were
essentially empty.

664
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:53,119
This is Ulana Khomyuk
of the Byelorussian Institute.

665
00:50:53,206 --> 00:50:55,496
Thanks to her insight,
we are now aware

666
00:50:55,581 --> 00:50:58,871
that the tanks are,
in fact, full.

667
00:50:58,956 --> 00:51:02,826
Of water. Why is that
a problem, professor?

668
00:51:04,039 --> 00:51:05,499
(Clears throat)

669
00:51:07,122 --> 00:51:08,792
When the lava
enters these tanks,

670
00:51:08,873 --> 00:51:11,213
it will instantly
superheat and vaporize

671
00:51:11,289 --> 00:51:14,959
approximately 7,000
cubic meters of water,

672
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:18,539
causing a significant
thermal explosion.

673
00:51:18,623 --> 00:51:20,583
How significant?

674
00:51:20,665 --> 00:51:24,535
We estimate between
two and four megatons.

675
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:27,923
Everything within
a 30-kilometer radius

676
00:51:27,997 --> 00:51:29,667
will be completely destroyed,

677
00:51:29,748 --> 00:51:33,078
including the three remaining
reactors at Chernobyl.

678
00:51:33,164 --> 00:51:36,674
The entirety of the radioactive
material in all of the cores

679
00:51:36,748 --> 00:51:39,828
will be ejected at force

680
00:51:39,915 --> 00:51:42,955
and dispersed by
a massive shock wave,

681
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:48,249
which will extend
approximately 200 kilometers

682
00:51:48,331 --> 00:51:51,621
and likely be fatal
to the entire population of Kiev

683
00:51:51,706 --> 00:51:53,746
as well as a portion of Minsk.

684
00:51:53,831 --> 00:51:56,751
The release of radiation
will be severe

685
00:51:56,831 --> 00:52:00,081
and will impact
all of Soviet Ukraine,

686
00:52:00,164 --> 00:52:03,794
Latvia, Lithuania,
Byelorussia,

687
00:52:03,873 --> 00:52:07,123
as well as Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary,

688
00:52:07,206 --> 00:52:09,866
Romania,
and most of East Germany.

689
00:52:13,539 --> 00:52:16,409
What do you mean "impact"?

690
00:52:17,206 --> 00:52:19,746
For much of the area,
a nearly permanent disruption

691
00:52:19,831 --> 00:52:22,371
of the food and water supply,

692

of cancer and birth defects.

I don't know how many deaths
there will be, but many.

694
00:52:29,081 --> 00:52:30,961
For Byelorussia and the Ukraine,

695
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:33,369
"impact" means
completely uninhabitable

696
00:52:33,456 --> 00:52:36,866
for a minimum of 100 years.

697
00:52:40,706 --> 00:52:44,116
There are more
than 50 million people

698
00:52:44,206 --> 00:52:46,956
living in Byelorussia
and Ukraine.

699
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:48,869
Sixty, yes.

700
00:52:53,247 --> 00:52:54,997
And how long
before this happens?

701
00:52:55,081 --> 00:52:58,961
Approximately 48 to 72 hours.

702
00:53:02,414 --> 00:53:04,834
But we may have a solution.

703
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:06,705
We can pump the water
from the tanks.

704
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:10,210
Unfortunately, the tanks are
sealed shut by a sluice gate,

705
00:53:10,289 --> 00:53:12,409
and the gate can only
be opened manually

706
00:53:12,498 --> 00:53:14,038
from within
the duct system itself.

707
00:53:14,122 --> 00:53:17,292
So we need to find
three plant workers

708
00:53:17,373 --> 00:53:18,963
who know the facility
well enough

709
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:20,669
to enter the basement here,

710
00:53:20,748 --> 00:53:24,998
find their way through
all these duct ways,

711
00:53:25,081 --> 00:53:27,161
get to the sluice gate
valve here,

712
00:53:27,247 --> 00:53:31,707
and give us the access we need
to pump out the tanks.

713
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:34,540
Of course, we will need
your permission.

714
00:53:34,623 --> 00:53:36,673
My permission for what?

715
00:53:36,748 --> 00:53:39,208

Legasov:
And open the sluice gate

The valve will be
difficult to operate,

727
00:55:37,289 --> 00:55:39,119
so we'll need three men

728

the basement layout.
