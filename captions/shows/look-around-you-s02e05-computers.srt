1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,152
This is BBC2.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,920
In a moment we'll be going over
to Shepherd's Bush

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,112
for tonight's edition of
Look Around You.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,554
But first, let's take a look at the
line-up for this coming Antmas Eve.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,797
Programmes for Antmas Eve on BBC2
start at 6.15

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,198
with action-packed drama
in The American Policeman.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,960
A faulty headlight
leads the American Policeman

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,799
to a case of semi-murder.

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,639
At 6.50 it's The Good News,

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,717
followed at 7.20 by For Sale,

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,232
which looks at a new housing
development in Lake Windermere.

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,876
Closedown is at the earlier time
of 7.45.

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,516
Then at 7.50
we pay another enchanting visit

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,029
to Tlentifini Maarhaysu.

15
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,031
At 8.40 it's The Bad News.

16
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,152
Then at 9.20 we join Dr Bukovsky

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,956
on his search
for Britain's Most Beautiful Bottom.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,992
Newsnight Special is at 10.30,

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,919
which takes a look
at a revolutionary new bird

20
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,237
which has the British chicken
industry running scared.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,595
Imagine That! is at 11.30

22
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,360
and this week the businessmen
are trying to imagine

23
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,156
a young Margaret Thatcher
tossing pancakes in the nuddy.

24
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,511
And with Football Highlights
at 12.25,

25
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,191
that rounds up programmes
for Antmas Eve on BBC2.

26
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,915
Well, that certainly sounds
like a very merry Antmas Eve.

27
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,794
And now, Look Around You.

28
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,476
Hello. Coming up
on tonight's programme...

29
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,911
We'll be taking a look at the
world's first computer for women.

30
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,273
We'll be demonstrating the very
latest in computer shaving systems.

31
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,712
Giving you a sneak preview of the
next generation of computer games.

32
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,879
And meeting Britain's
most powerful computer.

33
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,199
That's all on tonight's
computerised edition of...

34
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,598
(Computer beeps)

35
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,750
(Computer)'Look Around Yog.'

36
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,711
♪ Look Around You ♪

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,799
Hello and welcome to
Look Around You.

38
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,790
Tonight's programme is all about the
world and the future of computers.

39
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,675
Computers are increasingly
becoming part of our daily lives.

40
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,518
They're used for everything now,

41
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,837
from helping with the resurrection
of King Henry VIII

42
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,430
to the controlling
of Britain's second sun.

43
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,917
But computers, of course,
aren't 100 per cent reliable.

44
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,997
Recently a faulty computer program

45
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,238
was blamed for the disastrous
redecoration of the White House,

46
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,036
which led to computers being banned
in America for three years.

47
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,231
But one thing is certain.

48
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,840
Computers are here to stay.

49
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,669
In fact, experts predict
that by the year 1990,

50
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,599
the number of computers
in Great Britain alone

51
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,712
could be as many as 10,000.

52
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,558
Now, that sounds a lot,

53
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,877
but there's one computer
that's more powerful than them all.

54
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,879
It's Britain's most
technologically advanced computer

55
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,833
and it goes by the name
of Bournemouth.

56
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,712
There he is.

57
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,956
And here to tell us
all about Bournemouth

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,390
is the presenter
of BBC's computer programme

59
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,716
and a man who loves
computers so much,

60
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,276
he even changed his name
to Computer Jones.

61
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,236
- Welcome to Look Around You.
- Hello, Peter.

62
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,398
You were involved in the programming
of this computer.

63
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,671
I was its chief programmer,
actually.

64
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,952
Now, you've programmed hundreds
of computers in your career.

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,037
What makes Bournemouth so special?

66
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,393
Well, Bournemouth isn't like other
computers because he's so powerful.

67
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,432
In fact, he's so intelligent

68
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,075
he'd look on you and I
as a couple of morons.

69
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,554
- Really?
- Yes.

70
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,389
Which is why the government use him
to sort out their problems.

71
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,432
So what sort of things has he done?

72
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,315
Well, Bournemouth has been involved
in pretty much everything recently.

73
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,239
He helped in the introduction
of the negative currency

74
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,069
and he even assisted the police
in the recent margarine riots.

75
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,318
So he certainly knows how to handle
himself in the real world.

76
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,354
We're really going to put
Bournemouth to the test now

77
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,598
because we've devised
a special Look Around You challenge.

78
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,997
As you can see, we're locking
Bournemouth inside this cage here

79
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,033
and his task is to escape
by the end of the programme.

80
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,070
Thanks.

81
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,160
The cage is made from reinforced
steel so it's extremely secure.

82
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,117
You're gonna need some pretty big
brains to work your way out of this.

83
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,152
Well, best of luck, Bournemouth.

84
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,796
We'll see if he manages to escape
before the end of the show.

85
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,832
(Jack) Good luck, Bournemouth.

86
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,991
(Jack) What's in a name?

87
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,398
Well, letters, but for some of us
it's not that simple.

88
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,830
A recent survey
found that most Britons

89
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,678
had trouble remembering names,

90
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,111
with the name Philip
proving to be the most difficult.

91
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,470
Some things
seem to stay with us for ever.

92
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,080
For example
everyone remembers where they were

93
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,511
when they heard the news that
President Kennedy had been stabbed.

94
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,554
For years scientists have wondered
exactly which part of the brain

95
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,753
is responsible for storing these
so-called permanent remembrances.

96
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,440
And now, with the help of computers,

97
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,837
the part of the brain that labels
some memories as unforgettable

98
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,112
has been identified and utilised
in a new invention

99
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,119
which claims to make forgetfulness
a distant memory.

100
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,756
And it's our Invention of The Week.
It's called the Memory Helmet.

101
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,033
To demonstrate it I'll enlist the
help of our very own Pam Bachelor.

102
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,559
I'm not sure about this.

103
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,637
Don't worry,
it's not as scary as it looks.

104
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,354
- How's your Shakespeare?
- A bit rusty, I'm afraid.

105
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,234
Think you could remember
the titles of all his plays?

106
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,355
Goodness, I can only think of David
and the one about the farm.

107
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,359
In a moment you'll know them all,
guaranteed.

108
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,596
If you could just pop this on.

109
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,116
- Sorry, I won't knock you out.
- It's OK.

110
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,311
- Is that OK?
- Yes, thanks.

111
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,158
I'm going to show you a card

112
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,591
on which is written the titles
of all of Shakespeare's plays,

113
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,438
but just for one second,

114
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,154
and as soon as you see it
I want you to blink.

115
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,714
- OK?
- OK.

116
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,832
- Now, blink.
- Ooh.

117
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,714
Good. That information
is instantly stored

118
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,558
in the helmet's computer chip.

119
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,434
In a moment
it's going to transfer that data

120
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,315
via her optic nerve
into Pam's memory glands.

121
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,320
Now, because of the huge drain
of mental energy on the brain,

122
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,159
this will cause Pam's voice
to lower in pitch,

123
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,032
so don't be alarmed.

124
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,037
Now, let me just turn you on.

125
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,630
I must admit, it's a little bit
fiddly. It's round here somewhere.

126
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,717
- Ow.
- OK, let's just have a look.

127
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,270
- Are you OK, Pam?
- (Deep voice) Yes. Ooh!

128
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,074
Pam Bachelor,
will you please give us the titles

129
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,592
of all of Shakespeare's plays,
starting now?

130
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,356
- Summer In Paris.
- (Buzzer)

131
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,392
- Betty's Revenge.
- (Buzzer)

132
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,359
- Fantastic. Fantastic.
- Well done, Pam, that was great.

133
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,232
- Wasn't that great?
- Impressive.

134
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,840
- Did I get them all?
- 100 per cent.

135
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,360
Thank you very much.

136
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,995
The Memory Helmet
and its inventor Simon Teigh

137
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,910
win a place in the live final of our
Invention of the Year competition

138
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,758
at the end of the series,

139
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,111
where he could be walking away
with this magnificent trophy,

140
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,598
presented by His Royal Highness
Sir Prince Charles.

141
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,750
We've got
some rather disappointing news,

142
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,191
because we've had to stop
the Look Around You challenge.

143
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,314
If you remember, we'd set Britain's
most powerful computer, Bournemouth,

144
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,955
the task of escaping from this cage.

145
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,595
But unfortunately
Bournemouth has broken down

146
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,950
and needs to be repaired
immediately.

147
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,469
This is Eddie Yorque,
our chief technician.

148
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,512
Eddie, if I can stop you
for a moment,

149
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,358
can you tell us what happened?

150
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,839
Yeah, we received a telephone call
from Computer Jones

151
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,315
saying the circuit boards
had overheated...

152
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,192
(Computer) Hang on,
I didn't call you.

153
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,550
Wait a minute,
I know what's happened.

154
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,069
Leave him in his cage, will you?

155
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,713
What has happened?

156
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,276
He's tapped into your telephone
system and impersonated my voice.

157
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,199
- Wow.
- He does a good impression of me.

158
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,312
Listen. Bournemouth, say something.

159
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,194
- What would you like me to say?
- Oh, anything.

160
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,711
(Sighs) Hello,
this is Computer Jones speaking.

161
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,551
I'm 57, I live on my own and I
practise kissing on my Labrador.

162
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,876
- Thank you, Bournemouth.
- That is good.

163
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,039
He called poor Eddie and got him
to take him out of the cage.

164
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,073
- Well, you don't win that easily.
- Oh, really?

165
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,000
Well, it seems that the Look Around
You challenge is back on.

166
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,111
So let's see if Bournemouth
can escape

167
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,550
before the end of the programme.

168
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,791
(Pealy) Everyone loves a good game,

169
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,356
whether it's an exciting
round of Zero-X

170
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,960
or a 20-second bout
of quick-fire chess.

171
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,515
- Come on! Take it!
- Check him!

172
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,952
But today the gaming world has
really taken technology to heart,

173
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,836
with the robot John McEnroe being
this year's most sought-after toy.

174
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,076
'You cannot be serious!'

175
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,591
But if you don't have five and a
half million dollars to spare,

176
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,429
there's still one place you can go
for all your hi-tech thrills.

177
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,077
And that place is
Grithiffths Games Megamart.

178
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,151
Computers aren't just
for boring things

179
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,159
like writing poetry
or organising a funeral.

180
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,396
You can have
a lot of fun with them too

181
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,195
and when it comes to games,
Grithiffths have got the lot.

182
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,556
As Britain's leading game retailer,

183
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,796
Grithiffths gets
all the latest games,

184
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,516
from America,
Japan and, of course, Norway.

185
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,237
Lee Grithiffths is the managing
director of Grithiffths

186
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,796
and when he's not selling games,
he's playing games.

187
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,236
You look like you're enjoying
yourself.

188
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,717
Yes, I'm just playing this new game
called Window Cleaner.

189
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,357
- Ooh! It's very energetic.
- Yes, it is.

190
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,553
I'm just trying to work up a really
good thick head of foam.

191
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,717
(Squelching)

192
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,118
The graphics are very realistic.
It's like I'm watching a film.

193
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,076
Yes, the games are becoming
a lot more realistic these days.

194
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,555
It's what's known as
simulation games.

195
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,356
Simulation is where the computer
re-creates a real-world situation,

196
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,475
anything from taking a fully
accredited British driving test...

197
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,351
to a spot of horse-fighting.

198
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,676
(Computer)'Booma! Booma! Booma!'

199
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,949
This is a popular game.
It's called Holiday.

200
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,311
It re-creates the experience
of being on a summer holiday.

201
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,319
There are three settings:
Blackpool, camping

202
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,158
and a package holiday to Spain.

203
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,032
So where are you now?

204
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,311
I'm in Spain.
It's the best one, really.

205
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,670
Lee, I noticed
you've taken your top off.

206
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,712
That's the best way
to enjoy the game.

207
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,434
It's the total holiday experience,

208
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,552
so you can really immerse yourself
in the whole thing.

209
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,592
It even comes with its own beach.

210
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,760
It's a box of sand, really, but it
all adds to the reality of the thing

211
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,679
and it's Spanish sand, so...

212
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,554
- So they say.
- (Laughs)

213
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,752
The most popular computer game
at the moment is this one,

214
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,111
based on a recently discovered novel
by F Scott Fitzgerald.

215
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,594
(Computer)'Diarrhoea Dan.'

216
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,632
So why is it so popular?

217
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,036
Well, he's such a great character.

218
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,800
People always love
toilet-based games

219
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,878
and this is the best of the bunch,
it's great fun.

220
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,753
What does Lee think the future holds
for computer games?

221
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:54,956
Well, Pealy, I've always been
a big fan of romantic, sad films,

222
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,037
you know, the weepies,

223
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,278
so I think that a computer game
that could be

224
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,792
just as emotionally involving
as a sad film...

225
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:10,791
er, so sad that it can
actually make you physically cry...

226
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,432
I'd like to see that.

227
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,072
It would be fantastic.

228
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,518
It's official. Men love computers.

229
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,155
That's according to
the latest survey carried out

230
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:41,070
by popular men's leisure magazine
Popular Men's Leisure Magazine.

231
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,831
PMLM asked 2,000 men
to rank various leisure activities

232
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,872
in order of preference.

233
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,912
And, somewhat surprisingly,

234
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,919
using a home computer
comes top of the list,

235
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,239
beating some rather more traditional
male pursuits.

236
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:02,071
So clearly men have taken computers
to heart. But what about women?

237
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,433
Well, PMLM carried out
the same survey for them

238
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,278
and, rather interestingly,

239
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,030
using a home computer
didn't even make the top ten.

240
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,236
But all this may be about to change

241
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,717
because...step in the world's
first computer for women.

242
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,752
It's called the Petticoat 5

243
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,192
and here to tell us all about it
is its designer Patricia.

244
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,159
- Hello, Patricia. Welcome.
- Hello.

245
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,716
Now, the first thing to mention is
you only have one name, don't you?

246
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,958
Well, no, I do have a surname,
actually, but it's silent.

247
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,358
OK. Now, a computer for women.
How did the idea come about?

248
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,076
I had the idea in a dream originally

249
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,954
and then the next night
I dreamt about it again.

250
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,995
Then I probably had the same dream
for the next 40 or 50 nights

251
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,953
and I thought, "Yes, I'll do that."

252
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,119
- And that became the Petticoat 5?
- Yes, the Petticoat 5.

253
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,392
It's a computer
made by women for women.

254
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,511
So, let's take a look at it.

255
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,519
The first thing you notice
is the shape of the keys.

256
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,315
Yes. They're designed to make it
easier to type with long nails.

257
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,556
That is a good idea.
And what is this?

258
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,831
That's a place to put your rings.

259
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,430
And on the side here
we have a tissue dispenser...

260
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,914
(Coughs)

261
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,475
..and over here is a vanity mirror

262
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,876
which pops up
when you press this button.

263
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,196
And the space bar is an emery board.

264
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,392
So I suppose you could
fix your make-up while you work?

265
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,036
Yes, you could. Although
I don't wear make-up myself.

266
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,437
- OK. Now, may I have a go?
- Certainly.

267
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,630
Mm, the keys are nice and long,
aren't they?

268
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,911
- What's that smell?
- Peppermint.

269
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,838
Every time you press the letter S

270
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,874
it releases a small amount of
air freshener from this nozzle here.

271
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,071
Try it. Press S.

272
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,316
- Not F. S.
- Sorry.

273
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,750
- Not X. S.
- Sorry.

274
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,995
Ooh.

275
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,477
And we also do two other refill
cartridges in pine and tomato.

276
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,080
Well, it smells better
than my current computer.

277
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,079
The good news is the Petticoat 5

278
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,272
will soon be available from
your high street computer store.

279
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,119
At present there's only one program
available for it,

280
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,072
which is a lipstick colour chart,

281
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,998
but there are plans for many more.

282
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,270
(Pam) Thank you
and best of luck, Patricia...

283
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,711
We're back with
the computer challenge

284
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,036
and there's been
an exciting development.

285
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,471
Bournemouth has escaped
from the cage.

286
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,955
None of us can work out
how he's managed to do it

287
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,710
because, as you can see,
the cage is still locked.

288
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,276
I'm here with our special guest
Computer Jones.

289
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,800
What's your theory?

290
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,071
I think I've worked out
what he's done.

291
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,113
- Can someone open the cage for me?
- Certainly.

292
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,998
- Thanks, Eddie. OK.
- Thank you.

293
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,080
- Aha.
- What's going on?

294
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,396
Yes, it's just as I thought.

295
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,909
He's cheated.
He's made himself invisible.

296
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,954
I'm going to deactivate his
invisibility mode. Simple as that.

297
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,270
- There.
-'Oh, hello again.'

298
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,677
- Bournemouth's back.
- He won't be doing that again.

299
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,474
- Has he done that before?
- No.

300
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,594
Never. I knew he was capable of
invisibility but he's never done it.

301
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,836
Well, I wonder what he'll try next.

302
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,793
'Excuse me,
may I go to the toilet, please?'

303
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,230
(Computer) Nice try, Bournemouth.

304
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,319
Earlier on we showed you a computer
for women, the Petticoat 5.

305
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,512
But now it's time to have a look
at one for us blokes.

306
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,040
Hm.

307
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,800
If you've been
in a hotel or pub toilet recently,

308
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,991
you may well have seen one of these.

309
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,633
A Computashave.

310
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,071
These machines have revolutionised
the way men shave,

311
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,112
but they've been around for a while,

312
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,119
so you're probably wondering
why we're showing it to you.

313
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,480
Why are we?

314
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,594
Well, Jack, this latest model
has a rather remarkable new feature.

315
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,793
And to help us demonstrate it
is our technician Eddie Yorque.

316
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,235
- Busy night for you, isn't it?
- Yeah, a bit.

317
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,272
Now, Eddie, as you can see,

318
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,791
is blessed with
a rather magnificent beard.

319
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,116
Have you used a Computashave before?

320
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,631
Erm, no. I've seen one
but I've never used one.

321
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,273
Well, they're very simple.

322
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:44,236
I'll just stand you
into the head brace like so.

323
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,031
Now, keep very still.

324
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,232
We'll turn the unit on.

325
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,392
And the laser sets to work,

326
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,080
removing all the hair
from Eddie's face.

327
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,918
So let's have a look.

328
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,633
OK.

329
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,676
And, as you can see,
beard is completely gone.

330
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,111
- Good shave?
- Yeah. Very smooth.

331
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,914
The main thing is,
will your wife be pleased?

332
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,714
Er, yeah, probably.

333
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,558
(Laughs) Thanks, Eddie.

334
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,552
So, a very close shave,
but what's the big deal, Pete?

335
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,876
Ah. Well, let's try out
the new function.

336
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,833
If I can position you
in the head brace.

337
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,599
OK.

338
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,757
Tap away at the console.

339
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,832
Now, watch this.

340
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,151
- Gosh.
- So, what do you think?

341
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,476
Let me have a look.

342
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,991
Hm. I think it makes me look
ten years older.

343
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,838
How does it all work, Pete?

344
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,839
Well, when the laser removed
Eddie's facial hair,

345
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,793
it was stored in a special chamber.

346
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,230
When I set the machine
into reverse mode,

347
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,239
it literally fired the hairs back
at Jack's face

348
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,158
with such enormous speed

349
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,159
that the hairs became
so firmly embedded in the follicles

350
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,591
that they will continue to grow
as if they were his own.

351
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,874
But of course they're not his own,
they're Eddie's.

352
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,355
So effectively
Jack's wearing Eddie's beard.

353
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,835
And because the microchip remembers

354
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,918
the exact location
of every hair on Eddie's face,

355
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,555
the beards are completely identical,

356
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,592
as you can see.

357
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,632
I'm not so sure about this beard.

358
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,478
OK, so what do you fancy, sir?

359
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,273
I fancy something a bit more modern.

360
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,676
Coming right up.

361
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,550
The beauty of this system is that if
you're not happy with the results,

362
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:49,152
you're just a button away from any
one of a thousand different styles.

363
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,070
Hm. That's a bit more like it.

364
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,352
(Jack) Next week
is our live special,

365
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,154
featuring our
Invention of the Year final,

366
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,398
our search for the finest inventor
in Britain.

367
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,320
And His Royal Highness
Sir Prince Charles

368
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,795
will be here live
at Television Centre

369
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,400
to present the award
to one lucky winner.

370
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,998
And who will it be?

371
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,679
The nominations are...

372
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,995
Designed and made by Championess,
her computer recently predicted

373
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,999
the winner
of this year's horse Oscars,

374
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,396
Georgy Girl.

375
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,430
His cream reverses
the damaging effects of cobbles,

376
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,632
a disease that turns
healthy human skin into rock.

377
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:58,471
Dr Lavender made the headlines
recently after treating Rod Stewart.

378
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,272
Psilence is a spray
containing liquid skin

379
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,438
which eliminates all sound
when applied to the ears.

380
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,713
Hatred has recently brought out
a new product in the range,

381
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,752
Psightless.

382
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,995
This invention
harnesses and amplifies

383
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:26,159
the natural harmonics of vegetables
to produce music.

384
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,272
Teddy's orchestra have just returned
from a sell-out tour

385
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,119
of North Korea, Libya and Iran.

386
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,354
(Pam) As seen earlier...

387
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,717
(Jack) If you're watching, Mr Teigh,

388
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,355
please remember to give us
your full details

389
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,074
so we can send you your invitation.

390
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,715
And with one final invention
next week,

391
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,150
this promises to be
an unmissable occasion.

392
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,032
We do hope you'll be joining us

393
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,040
for the Look Around You
Invention of the Year final.

394
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,471
Well, that's about it for tonight.

395
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,160
It looks like Bournemouth
has lost the challenge.

396
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,431
He has failed to escape
from his cage.

397
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,711
The programme's not over yet, Peter.

398
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,752
Well, that may be, Computer Jones.

399
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,759
Pealy, you saw something
unusual-looking moments ago.

400
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,110
Yes. When we were filming
the last item

401
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,550
I'm sure I saw Bournemouth
behind Jack.

402
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,000
- Really?
- I did too.

403
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,156
Eddie.

404
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,872
Well, we're just
opening the cage again.

405
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,360
Thank you.

406
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:35,074
Ah! Very clever.

407
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,992
Ah! Well, it seems
that I owe you an apology

408
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,192
because Bournemouth has escaped

409
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,553
and he's made this papier-mache
replica of himself as a decoy.

410
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,398
- It's uncanny.
- Wow!

411
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,512
Well, it seems that Bournemouth
has outwitted us all

412
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,632
and successfully completed
tonight's challenge.

413
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,115
So, well done, Bournemouth.

414
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,674
Well done indeed!

415
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,796
Goodness me!

416
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,038
The big question is, where is he?

417
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,991
Well, on that rather mysterious note

418
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,477
I'm afraid that really is
all the time we've got for tonight.

419
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,512
So many thanks to all our guests,

420
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,519
to Patricia,
designer of the Petticoat 5,

421
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,358
and of course to Computer Jones.

422
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,950
And a special thanks, of course,
to our very patient

423
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,118
and now beardless chief technician,
Eddie Yorque.

424
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,393
Thanks, Eddie.

425
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,920
Theddie.

426
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,960
(Whispering)

427
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,114
Erm...

428
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,393
Well, I've just been told that
we have received a telephone call

429
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,717
from Bournemouth...from Bournemouth.

430
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,436
And I understand
he's on the line now.

431
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,911
Hello.

432
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,997
(Line crackling)

433
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,111
Hello?

434
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,959
(Electronic chime)'Hello there.'

435
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,469
Ah. Bournemouth, where are you?

436
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,036
-'I'm in Bournemouth.'
- Yes, we know. What are you doing?

437
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,197
'Well, none of your business,
actually,

438
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,039
'but I'm having a bit of a break
from everything.'

439
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,275
- Are you?
-'Yes.

440
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,473
'I didn't want to be lonely so I've
taken the Petticoat 5 with me.'

441
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,035
Oh, God. I hope she's OK.

442
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,472
'Yes, she's fine. You can talk to
her if you like. Hang on.

443
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,194
'Petticoat, it's for you.'

444
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,394
(Patricia) Hello?
(Petticoat 5)'Hello.'

445
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,432
- Hello?
-'Hello.'

446
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,676
- Is that the Petticoat 5?
-'Yes.'

447
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,952
- I didn't know you could talk.
-'Bournemouth taught me.

448
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,196
'He taught me lots of things.'

449
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,038
- Did he?
-'Yes.'

450
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,151
Bournemouth,
when are you coming back?

451
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,955
'When you stop interfering
with Goldie. Goodbye.'

452
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,878
- (Dialling tone)
- Ah.

453
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,877
Well...oh, he's gone.

454
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,560
He's gone. So, well...er...

455
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,632
Best of luck to both of them.

456
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,677
So, from all of us at Shepherd's
Bush, take care of yourself

457
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,758
and remember,
wherever you are, whatever you do...

458
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,031
(All) Look Around You!

459
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,992
(Indistinct dialogue)

460
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,112
If you live in the Bournemouth area

461
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,152
and think you may have seen
Bournemouth,

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,510
please do not approach him

463
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,394
as he is fitted
with a powerful computer program

464
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,591
that can make you piss yourself.
