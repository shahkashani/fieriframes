00:13:52,702 --> 00:13:54,622
I think you and I
should take a walk.

179
00:13:54,702 --> 00:13:56,742
It's late. I'm tired.

180
00:13:57,743 --> 00:14:00,293

-(Legasov sighs)

185

What will happen
to our boys?

186
00:14:17,577 --> 00:14:19,867
Which boys?
The divers?

187
00:14:19,951 --> 00:14:23,291
The divers, the firefighters,
the men in the control room.

188
00:14:23,368 --> 00:14:26,948
What does the radiation
do to them precisely?

189
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:31,287
At the levels some
of them were exposed?

190
00:14:31,368 --> 00:14:35,198
Ionizing radiation tears
the cellular structure apart.

191
00:14:35,285 --> 00:14:38,865
The skin blisters,
turns red, then black.

192
00:14:39,993 --> 00:14:42,703
This is followed
by a latency period.

193
00:14:43,785 --> 00:14:45,575
The immediate
effects subside.

194

to be recovering.

195
00:14:48,785 --> 00:14:51,195

But they aren't.

196
00:14:52,785 --> 00:14:56,325
This usually only lasts
for a day or two.

197
00:14:58,702 --> 00:14:59,992
Continue.

198
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:04,869
Then the cellular damage
begins to manifest.

199
00:15:04,951 --> 00:15:10,291
The bone marrow dies,
the immune system fails,

200
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:14,158
the organs and soft tissue
begin to decompose.

201
00:15:14,243 --> 00:15:18,243
The arteries and veins
spill open like sieves,

202
00:15:18,326 --> 00:15:20,786
to the point where you can't
even administer morphine

203
00:15:20,868 --> 00:15:25,118
for the pain,
which is... unimaginable.

204
00:15:25,201 --> 00:15:28,701
And then three days
to three weeks, you are dead.

205
00:15:30,951 --> 00:15:33,371
That is what will happen
to those boys.

206
00:15:35,493 --> 00:15:36,993
And what about us?

207
00:15:40,243 --> 00:15:41,913
Well, we've...

208
00:15:41,993 --> 00:15:46,163
We've gotten a steady dose,
but not as much of it.

209
00:15:46,243 --> 00:15:48,243
Not strong enough
to kill the cells,

210
00:15:48,326 --> 00:15:51,366
but consistent enough
to damage our DNA.

211
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:56,118
So, in time... cancer.

212
00:15:56,201 --> 00:15:59,411
Or aplastic anemia.
Either way, fatal.

213
00:16:02,368 --> 00:16:03,738
Well...

214
00:16:05,326 --> 00:16:11,236
in a sense, it would seem we've
gotten off easy then, Valery.

215
00:16:23,785 --> 00:16:25,785
I've seen them before.

216
00:16:31,535 --> 00:16:34,785
Now you know why
I wanted to take a walk.

217
00:16:34,909 --> 00:16:37,409
We can presume
the work site is bugged.

218
00:16:38,076 --> 00:16:41,986
And our rooms,
even our bathrooms.

219
00:16:42,076 --> 00:16:44,486
They've been here
the whole time.

220
00:16:44,577 --> 00:16:46,657
Of course they've been
here the whole time.

221
00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:51,489
But if we're seeing them
out in the open now,

222
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:54,407
it's because
they want us to know.

Yes.

230
00:17:52,368 --> 00:17:54,368
There's something I've wanted
to ask you, comrade,

231
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:57,871
but I see you're already asking
yourself the same question.

232
00:18:01,868 --> 00:18:04,238
Why did it explode?

233
00:18:05,743 --> 00:18:07,953

over and over,

conditions in an RBMK reactor.

235

And I always get
the same answer.

236
00:18:16,326 --> 00:18:17,826
Which is?

237

356
00:28:35,368 --> 00:28:37,288
Do these work?

357
00:28:38,201 --> 00:28:39,991
To an extent.

358
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,660
Of course.

359
00:28:56,285 --> 00:28:58,615
So what's the job?

360
00:28:59,827 --> 00:29:03,407
We need to install a liquid
nitrogen heat exchanger

361
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:06,623
underneath this concrete pad.

362
00:29:06,702 --> 00:29:10,622
There's no way to approach
from the interior
of the building,

363
00:29:10,702 --> 00:29:12,742
so you have to get at it
from underground.

364
00:29:12,827 --> 00:29:16,617
-And what's above the pad?
-The core of
the nuclear reactor,

365
00:29:16,702 --> 00:29:19,662
which is melting down.

366
00:29:19,743 --> 00:29:22,333
What? Like...

367
00:29:23,868 --> 00:29:25,078
Essentially.

368
00:29:26,909 --> 00:29:28,239
Is it gonna fall
on top of us?

369
00:29:28,326 --> 00:29:30,326
Not if you're done
within six weeks.

370
00:29:32,285 --> 00:29:34,155

371
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:39,079
Break ground here,

372
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:41,449
dig a tunnel
150 meters to here,

373
00:29:41,535 --> 00:29:44,655
excavate a space
30 by 30 meters

374
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:46,373
for the heat exchanger.

375
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,621
And because we need to keep
disruption of the ground above
to a minimum,

376
00:29:49,702 --> 00:29:51,582
you can't use
any heavy machinery.

377
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,030
It has to be done by hand.

378
00:29:53,118 --> 00:29:55,408
Then I need more men.

379
00:29:56,951 --> 00:29:58,291
Four hundred at least.

380
00:29:58,368 --> 00:30:00,868
We'll have to work
around the clock.

381
00:30:00,951 --> 00:30:02,791
How deep do you want
this tunnel? Six meters?

382
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:05,788
-Twelve.
-Twelve? Why?

383
00:30:05,868 --> 00:30:08,368
For your protection.

384
00:30:08,451 --> 00:30:12,291
At that depth,
you'll be shielded from
much of the radiation.

385
00:30:12,368 --> 00:30:16,618
The entrance to the tunnel
won't be 12 meters below ground.

386
00:30:17,909 --> 00:30:19,739
No.

387
00:30:19,827 --> 00:30:22,867

below ground now.

388
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:30,453

00:44:25,535 --> 00:44:27,075
Get out. Get out of here.

534
00:44:27,159 --> 00:44:29,489
Let me go! Let me go!

535
00:44:29,577 --> 00:44:32,117
Stop it! Stop it!

536
00:44:34,743 --> 00:44:37,373
You let her in that room?
Inside the plastic,
touching him?

537
00:44:37,451 --> 00:44:39,991
-Did you know she's pregnant?
-It's not true!

538
00:44:40,076 --> 00:44:43,786
-What have you done?
-What kind of place is this?
Where is her protection?

539
00:44:43,868 --> 00:44:46,828
-Do you have any idea
what you're dealing with?
-Of course I do.

540
00:44:46,909 --> 00:44:48,369
-Please, I do not--
-No.

541
00:44:48,451 --> 00:44:50,661
-People are going
to hear about this.
-Wait.

542
00:44:50,743 --> 00:44:52,493
People are going to hear.
Do you understand?

543
00:44:52,577 --> 00:44:54,487
Everyone is going to hear.

544
00:44:54,577 --> 00:44:56,617
Man:
What is everyone
gonna hear?

545
00:45:02,785 --> 00:45:04,655
I am with the official
Chernobyl Commission,

546
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:06,873
and I've been authorized
by Valery Legasov.

547
00:45:06,951 --> 00:45:10,201
-You can check this.
My name is Ulana--
-We know who you are.

548
00:45:13,618 --> 00:45:16,538
What is everyone gonna hear?

549
00:45:36,493 --> 00:45:38,453
Shcherbina;
You have your notes?

550
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:40,115
Yes.

551
00:45:42,368 --> 00:45:44,078
Khomyuk was arrested
last night.

552
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:46,869
What? Why?

553
00:45:46,951 --> 00:45:48,411
I don't know.

554
00:45:49,577 --> 00:45:52,907
-Was it--?
-Of course it was.

555
00:45:54,326 --> 00:45:55,446
I'm working on it.

556
00:45:55,535 --> 00:45:58,365
-Boris--
-I'm working on it.

557
00:45:59,618 --> 00:46:01,738
What more do you
want from me?

558
00:46:01,827 --> 00:46:03,327
Fix your tie.

559
00:46:07,326 --> 00:46:08,696
(Door opens)

560
00:46:09,827 --> 00:46:11,237
They'll see you now.

561
00:46:21,326 --> 00:46:24,906
After thousands of sorties,
our brave helicopter crews

562
00:46:24,993 --> 00:46:26,413
successfully
extinguished the fire.

563
00:46:26,493 --> 00:46:29,123
The miners are working
heroically to ensure

564
00:46:29,201 --> 00:46:31,331
that the fuel does not
reach the groundwater.

565
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:33,580
And furthermore,
there is no longer

566
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,200
a threat of
additional explosion.

567
00:46:35,285 --> 00:46:40,115
The Soviet people
have faced the challenge
and risen to the task,

568
00:46:40,201 --> 00:46:42,791
and they and everyone
in this room are to be
commended.

569
00:46:47,993 --> 00:46:50,623
Lastly, Professor Legasov
and I have been vigilant

570
00:46:50,702 --> 00:46:53,082
to protect the security
interests of the State.

571
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:55,739
And since the unfortunate
release of information

572
00:46:55,827 --> 00:46:57,117
directly following
the accident,

573
00:46:57,201 --> 00:47:00,161
we believe that there
has been no further lapse.

574
00:47:00,243 --> 00:47:02,663
Comrade Charkov,

575
00:47:02,743 --> 00:47:06,703
we hope we have lived up
to the highest standards
of the KGB.

576
00:47:06,785 --> 00:47:07,825
You have.

577
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:09,579
Shcherbina:
Thank you.

578
00:47:10,743 --> 00:47:14,123
Professor Legasov
will now speak about

579
00:47:14,201 --> 00:47:15,661
the work that remains.

580
00:47:17,785 --> 00:47:19,445
Thank you.

581
00:47:22,909 --> 00:47:25,829
Deputy Chairman Shcherbina
has given you the good news,

582
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:27,829
and it is good.

583
00:47:27,909 --> 00:47:30,449
The immediate danger is over.

584
00:47:30,535 --> 00:47:33,655
Now, I'm afraid,
a long war must begin.

585
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:37,535
There is an enormous amount
of radioactive debris

586
00:47:37,618 --> 00:47:39,738
and contamination
spread out across a zone

587
00:47:39,827 --> 00:47:42,287
of approximately
2600 square kilometers.

588
00:47:42,368 --> 00:47:47,738
This entire region must be
completely evacuated.

589
00:47:47,827 --> 00:47:51,947
We must go to every town,
every village to ensure this.

590
00:47:52,034 --> 00:47:57,874
And all animals still
surviving within the zone,

591
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:00,581
whether domesticated or wild,

592
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:04,910
must be presumed contaminated
and will have to be destroyed

593
00:48:04,993 --> 00:48:08,373
to prevent the spread
of radiation and disease.

594
00:48:08,451 --> 00:48:11,871
In the immediate area
surrounding Chernobyl,

595
00:48:11,951 --> 00:48:17,411
uh, every rock, every tree,
the very ground itself,

596
00:48:17,493 --> 00:48:21,373
has absorbed a dangerous
amount of radionuclides,

597
00:48:21,451 --> 00:48:24,451
which will be carried
by the wind and the rain
if left exposed.

598
00:48:24,535 --> 00:48:26,865
So we will have to raze
entire forests.

599
00:48:26,951 --> 00:48:29,031
We will have to rip up
the top layer of earth

600
00:48:29,118 --> 00:48:30,408
and bury it under itself,

601
00:48:30,493 --> 00:48:34,033
approximately,
100 square kilometers.

602
00:48:35,743 --> 00:48:39,083
Um, and finally,
we will need to construct

603
00:48:39,159 --> 00:48:44,119
a containment structure
around the power plant itself,

604
00:48:44,201 --> 00:48:47,741
which will, of course,
still be extremely...

605
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:52,330
There will be deaths.

606
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,450
What amount of time,

607
00:48:57,535 --> 00:48:59,155
and how many men
do you require?

608
00:48:59,243 --> 00:49:02,993
We expect this liquidation
effort to take three years

609
00:49:03,076 --> 00:49:05,406
and approximately 750,000 men,

610
00:49:05,493 --> 00:49:10,873
including a number of doctors
and structural engineers.

611
00:49:10,951 --> 00:49:13,411
How many deaths?

612
00:49:13,493 --> 00:49:15,453
Thousands.

613
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:18,075
Perhaps tens of thousands.

614
00:49:25,493 --> 00:49:27,203
Gorbachev:
Begin at once.

615
00:49:29,451 --> 00:49:31,541
(Men murmuring)

616
00:49:32,618 --> 00:49:35,198
-Legasov: Comrade Charkov.
-Shcherbina: Valery!

617
00:49:36,868 --> 00:49:38,198
Yes, Professor?

618
00:49:39,243 --> 00:49:42,123
My associate was
arrested last night.

619
00:49:42,201 --> 00:49:43,541
Oh?

620
00:49:44,535 --> 00:49:47,735
I mean no disrespect,
but I was wondering
if you could tell me why.

621
00:49:47,827 --> 00:49:50,117
I assure you, I don't know
who you're talking about.

622
00:49:50,201 --> 00:49:52,991
She was arrested
by the KGB.

623
00:49:53,076 --> 00:49:56,116
You are the first deputy
chairman of the KGB.

624
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,661
I am.

625
00:49:57,743 --> 00:50:00,663
That's why I don't have
to bother with arresting
people anymore.

626
00:50:00,743 --> 00:50:03,163
But you are bothering
with having us followed.

627
00:50:04,493 --> 00:50:06,953
I think the deputy
chairman is busy.

628
00:50:07,034 --> 00:50:09,164
No, no. It's perfectly
understandable.

629
00:50:09,243 --> 00:50:13,163
Comrade, I know you've heard
the stories about us.

630
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:15,583
When I hear them,
even I am shocked.

631
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,580
But we are not
what people say.

632
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:20,410
Yes, people are
following you.

633
00:50:20,493 --> 00:50:22,913
People are following
those people.

634
00:50:22,993 --> 00:50:24,243
You see them?

635
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:28,370
They follow me.

636
00:50:28,451 --> 00:50:32,541
The KGB is a circle
of accountability.

637
00:50:32,618 --> 00:50:33,828
Nothing more.

638
00:50:33,909 --> 00:50:36,329
You know the work
we're doing here.

639
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:40,452
-You really don't trust us?
-Of course I do.

640
00:50:40,535 --> 00:50:43,735
But you know
the old Russian proverb:

641
00:50:43,827 --> 00:50:45,867
"Trust but verify."

642
00:50:47,785 --> 00:50:51,365
And the Americans think that
Ronald Reagan thought that up.

643
00:50:51,451 --> 00:50:52,791
Can you imagine?

644
00:50:53,909 --> 00:50:56,369
It was very nice
speaking with you.

645
00:50:56,451 --> 00:50:58,031
I need her.

646
00:51:00,618 --> 00:51:03,198
So you will be
accountable for her?

647
00:51:07,785 --> 00:51:09,325
Then it's done.

648
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:13,199
-Her name is--
-I know who she is.

649
00:51:13,285 --> 00:51:15,115
Good day, Professor.

650
00:51:24,827 --> 00:51:28,407
No, that went
surprisingly well.

651
00:51:28,493 --> 00:51:30,663
You came off like
a naive idiot.

652
00:51:32,034 --> 00:51:34,834
And naive idiots
are not a threat.

653
00:51:50,326 --> 00:51:52,986
Man:
I'll come back when
the paperwork is complete.

654
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:03,580
-Are you all right?
-They didn't hurt me.

655
00:52:05,368 --> 00:52:07,868
They let a pregnant woman
into a room with a...

656
00:52:07,951 --> 00:52:11,121
(Sighs)
It doesn't matter.

657
00:52:11,201 --> 00:52:13,871
They were stupid.
I was stupid.

658
00:52:15,285 --> 00:52:17,285
Dyatlov won't talk to me.

659
00:52:18,493 --> 00:52:22,083
Akimov, yes,
Toptunov, yes, but...

660
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:24,789
(Sighs)
Valery,

661
00:52:24,868 --> 00:52:26,368
Akimov...

662
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:29,287
his face was gone.

663
00:52:32,034 --> 00:52:33,704
You want to stop?

664
00:52:35,577 --> 00:52:38,027
Is that a choice I even have?

665
00:52:45,868 --> 00:52:49,658
Do you think the fuel will
actually melt through
the concrete pad?

666
00:52:49,743 --> 00:52:53,243
I don't know.
A 40% chance maybe.

667
00:52:55,743 --> 00:52:58,543
I said 50.
(Chuckles)

668
00:52:58,618 --> 00:53:00,908
Either way, the numbers
mean the same thing:

669
00:53:00,993 --> 00:53:03,033
"Maybe."

670
00:53:03,118 --> 00:53:04,828
(Sighing)

671
00:53:04,909 --> 00:53:08,199
Maybe the core will melt
through to the groundwater.

672
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:10,655
Maybe the miners who I've told
to dig under the reactor

673
00:53:10,743 --> 00:53:13,163
will save millions of lives.

674
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:16,910
Maybe I'm killing them
for nothing.

675
00:53:20,743 --> 00:53:22,793
I don't want to do
this anymore.

676
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:25,826
I want to stop.

677
00:53:27,535 --> 00:53:29,025
But I can't.

678
00:53:30,201 --> 00:53:33,291
I don't think you have
a choice any more than I do.

679
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:38,030
I think,
despite the stupidity,

680
00:53:38,118 --> 00:53:40,868
the lies, even this...

681
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:43,031
you are compelled.

682
00:53:43,118 --> 00:53:45,538
The problem has been assigned,
and you will stop at nothing

683
00:53:45,618 --> 00:53:47,028
until you find an answer.

684
00:53:47,118 --> 00:53:50,288
Because that is
who you are.

685
00:53:52,118 --> 00:53:53,988
A lunatic, then.

686
00:53:55,827 --> 00:53:58,077
A scientist.

687
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:00,029
(Door unlocking)

688
00:54:19,034 --> 00:54:21,994
Did you know that they were
running a safety test?

689
00:54:23,201 --> 00:54:25,991
-Yeah.
-There's something else.

690
00:54:27,326 --> 00:54:30,486
Akimov says
they shut the reactor down,

691
00:54:30,577 --> 00:54:32,907
and Toptunov confirms it.

692
00:54:32,993 --> 00:54:36,833
-They pressed AZ-5.
-Apparently not soon enough.

693
00:54:36,909 --> 00:54:38,449
No.

694
00:54:38,535 --> 00:54:43,155
They say Akimov
pressed AZ-5,

695
00:54:43,243 --> 00:54:45,873
and then
the reactor exploded.

696
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:50,196
If it had been just one of them,
I would have put it under

697
00:54:50,285 --> 00:54:52,535
faulty memory
or delusion even,

698
00:54:52,618 --> 00:54:56,408
but they both agreed.
They were adamant.

699
00:55:00,909 --> 00:55:02,409
Comrade?

700
00:55:04,535 --> 00:55:08,115
-Do you think it's possible?
-I think it makes no sense.

701
00:55:08,201 --> 00:55:11,661
I think it's what
I would say if I was trying
to cover my own mistakes.

702
00:55:11,743 --> 00:55:13,373
But?

703
00:55:14,493 --> 00:55:16,203
I believed them.

704
00:55:18,326 --> 00:55:19,786
