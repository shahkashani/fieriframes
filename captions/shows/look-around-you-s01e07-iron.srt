1
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,913
Look around you.

2
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,191
Look around you.

3
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,599
Just look around you.

4
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,470
Have you worked out
what we're looking for?

5
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,910
Correct. The answer is...

6
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,119
This programme, "Iron",

7
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,431
is discussed
in chapter 3 of your textbook,

8
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,751
which accompanies this series.

9
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,470
Please ensure that you have
your copybook at hand,

10
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,155
as you'll be asked to
take notes down from the screen

11
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,789
at various points
throughout the programme.

12
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,672
Iron, or to give it its full name,
Iron De Havilland,

13
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,390
is one of the sturdiest
and heaviest of all elements.

14
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,040
(CRASH)

15
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,394
This is thanks largely
to its rigid molecular structure.

16
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,353
Here is a model
of an iron molecule.

17
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,679
And here is a model of a model
of an iron molecule,

18
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,957
modelled in iron.

19
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,319
Man has been using iron
since the Stone Age,

20
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,599
and over the years, we've garnered
a healthy respect for the metal,

21
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,831
so that Sundays are now devoted

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,676
to the cleaning and polishing
of all our iron possessions.

23
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,312
But it's not all work.

24
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,759
As a young child, you may have
played with iron filings,

25
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,515
counting and recounting them
over and over again,

26
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,197
and keeping a daily record
of the figures in your iron diary.

27
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,432
Some of you may even have tried
bending an iron spoon

28
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,399
using nothing
but the powers of your imagination.

29
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,553
It rarely works, but it's fun,
and that's what counts.

30
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,879
Of course, it's hard to know
what De Havilland himself,

31
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,238
the father of iron chemistry,
would make of all this,

32
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,791
but no doubt he'd probably
have a twinkle in his eye.

33
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,032
An experiment was carried out

34
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,080
to demonstrate the effects
of sulphuric acid upon iron.

35
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,480
First, a sample of iron
is placed upon a Ravenscroft pan.

36
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,199
(CRASH)

37
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,792
Next, a small quantity of sulphuric
acid is collected, via a pipette.

38
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,114
The bell is sounded
and the experiment can begin.

39
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,710
The scientist releases
a tiny drop of acid onto the iron,

40
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,477
probably only about point
point five point 05 microgallons.

41
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,111
Observe the reaction and note down
the results in your copybook.

42
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,639
The sulphuric acid has broken
the iron into its most basic form,

43
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,918
brown iron, or Bumcivilian.

44
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,873
Now watch what happens when the
scientist rings the bell this time.

45
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,512
(SILENCE)

46
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,679
The bell's not broken,
it's in good working order.

47
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,197
It's just that
when Bumcivilian is produced,

48
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,718
it has the effect of sucking in
all the sound from its vicinity.

49
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,236
Even with the scientist joining in,

50
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,392
we still hear nothing.

51
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,715
But after a few seconds,
the effect diminishes.

52
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,078
(SCIENTIST SHOUTS, BELL RINGS)

53
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,794
Let's take a look
at some of the ways iron is used.

54
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,069
Iron is used to make irons,

55
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,992
as well as thimbles and knives.

56
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,719
An iron horseshoe
is a popular item,

57
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,600
as it brings its owner good luck.

58
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,715
You've probably seen one
in your parents' car.

59
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,793
Amongst the most regular users
of iron in a professional capacity

60
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,512
are the police force, because
iron is used to make handcuffs.

61
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,231
And also this,

62
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,598
the face shackle,
worn by petty criminals.

63
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,878
The face shackle
is a kind of portable prison,

64
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,954
which must be worn around the clock
for periods of up to 18 months,

65
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,999
or three years
if you're a repeat offender.

66
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,749
The cheapest kind of iron
in modern usage is pig iron,

67
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,640
so called
because it's manufactured by pigs.

68
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,280
(CRASH)

69
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,875
Pigs are much more cost-effective
than humans,

70
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,431
and they work far longer hours
than any man would tolerate.

71
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,479
There are currently plans for them
to have their own trade union,

72
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,190
although whether this would work
in reality, nobody knows.

73
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,792
An experiment was carried out

74
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,715
to illustrate the effects
of electricity upon iron.

75
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,269
First, an iron pyramid
is placed upon the work surface.

76
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,791
Next, the pyramid is connected
to an electrical circuit,

77
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,998
powered by a 9-volt battery.

78
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,237
We're going to feed
both an AC and a DC current

79
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,397
through the ferric pyramid,

80
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,032
and so the battery itself
is connected to the mains.

81
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,750
We're working with AC/DC
because it's heavy metal.

82
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,674
(WHIRRING)

83
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,478
We're going to turn on
the current now,

84
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,553
so get ready to take down
notes from the screen.

85
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,392
(BUZZING)

86
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,030
Did you see that?

87
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,989
The bolt of electricity
passed right through the building.

88
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,391
Let's take a look outside.

89
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,991
An enormous pair of scissors
has appeared in the sky

90
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,152
directly above the laboratory.

91
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,712
And after a few moments...

92
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,432
..it's gone.

93
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,200
It's an old experiment
that you've probably seen before,

94
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,795
but well worth trying nonetheless.

95
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,199
Now hand in your copybook
to your teacher or head of class.

96
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,314
In the next programme,
we will look at flowers.
