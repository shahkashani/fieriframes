1
00:00:38,907 --> 00:00:40,108
Mr.Williamson...

2
00:00:40,508 --> 00:00:41,442
Where is he?

3
00:00:41,676 --> 00:00:42,911
He's not in.

4
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:47,448
He's there, isn't he?
I don't believe you, ma'am.

5
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:52,253
You can't go in there!
Mr.Williamson.

6
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:06,501
It's incredible, isn't it?

7
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:13,641
Williamson City... that's very
impressive.

8
00:01:14,676 --> 00:01:16,411
Doesn't it make you feel proud?

9
00:01:19,814 --> 00:01:23,384
Mr.Williamson! Mr.Williamson!

10
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:26,921
I said where is he?

11
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:28,957
At the construction site.

12
00:01:54,048 --> 00:01:55,016
Where's Markham?

13
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:56,317
He's up there.

14
00:01:59,454 --> 00:02:00,822
Markham, up there?

15
00:02:01,222 --> 00:02:01,823
Who?

16
00:02:01,923 --> 00:02:03,024
Markham, Markham.

17
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:06,794
He's not up here. I think he's over on
the bridge.

18
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:10,231
Hey, Mr.Markham, Mr.Markham.

19
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:11,766
I saw him five minutes ago...

20
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:15,870
...when he came in... what are you
yelling about?

21
00:02:16,004 --> 00:02:17,472
Thank you, thank you.

22
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:28,883
Boy, that guy's sure in a hurry.

23
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,118
Yes, he is.

24
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:37,291
You wanna talk about the
dedication later, Mr.Markham?

25
00:02:37,392 --> 00:02:39,494
No, Carl. I wanna talk about it
right now.

26
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:41,462
What time is it scheduled to start?

27
00:02:41,863 --> 00:02:43,164
Nine o'clock in the morning, sir.

28
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:49,404
And you've got the seats facing
East?

29
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:52,740
East? Oh, is that East? Oh, yeah.
That's East.

30
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:55,677
We don't want the people looking into the
sun, do we? Carl.

31
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,412
No, sir. I'll rearrange the seats,
Mr.Markham.

32
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:58,680
Thank you, Carl.

33
00:02:59,514 --> 00:03:04,585
Bo! What a pleasant surprise.
Didn't know you were here.

34
00:03:06,421 --> 00:03:07,588
When did you get back?

35
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:09,891
Just in time, it looks like!

36
00:03:10,124 --> 00:03:11,025
What's the matter?

37
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:13,227
Williamson City, that's what's the
matter.

38
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:15,329
Oh, you spoke to your wife.

39
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:18,066
No, I didn't speak to my wife.
I just got back from eight weeks...

40
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:20,702
...in Europe and I find she's off at
some phoney health farm.

41
00:03:20,902 --> 00:03:21,736
Well, maybe I better explain.

42
00:03:21,903 --> 00:03:23,438
You don't have to explain anything.

43
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:27,108
You know what else I found? A bunch
of letters between you and her and...

44
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:29,343
...about a mile-high stack of
blueprints.

45
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:32,380
Oh, it's the most revolutionary
concept I ever had.

46
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:34,782
Jennifer and I assumed you'd be
delighted.

47
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:37,919
Delighted? Let me tell you. Nobody
throws a lasso around my...

48
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:40,254
...money without my consent,
that includes my wife.

49
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:41,689
And you had better believe it!

50
00:03:41,856 --> 00:03:44,358
Well, you were in Europe. There was
no way to get in touch with you.

51
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:45,760
You could've waited.

52
00:03:45,927 --> 00:03:47,595
We were positive you'd agree.

53
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:51,099
Agree? Forget it, boy.
The joyride is over!

54
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:53,101
But the machinery's already been
set in motion.

55
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:56,003
Well, then you unset it! And I'll
tell you something else.

56
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,339
Don't ever speak to my wife or me
again.

57
00:03:58,473 --> 00:04:00,975
She's too young to recognize
a con man when she sees one.

58
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:04,045
Can I suggest you consider what
you're saying. You're not talking...

59
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:04,979
...to one of your underlings.

60
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:07,415
Oh, listen. I know exactly who I'm
talking to.

61
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:10,384
But Bo, listen, listen. This
project can give you immortality.

62
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:13,020
As long as that city stands
your name will be remembered.

63
00:04:13,221 --> 00:04:17,859
Name? I'm gonna tell you something
Jackson boy! My wallet is a lot more...

64
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,527
...important to me than my name.

65
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:21,829
You really are a Philistine,
aren't you?

66
00:04:21,963 --> 00:04:22,563
What?

67
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,666
All you care about is money. You
wouldn't reconize art if you...

68
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,169
...fell over it. We have a chance to
do something extraordinary here...

69
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:29,070
and you're trying to ruin it.

70
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:33,941
That's right. Quite right! And if
you're on some kind of an ego trip...

71
00:04:34,075 --> 00:04:35,810
...you find somebody else to pay
for it.

72
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,478
Bo, I have a thought.

73
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:40,548
Would you commission me to design
your burial vault?

74
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,452
That would be about your speed.

75
00:04:45,153 --> 00:04:47,088
You really would like to see me
dead, wouldn't you?

76
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,425
But I'll tell you something.
It wouldn't count for much.

77
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:53,427
Well, maybe your wife might have
other ideas.

78
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:57,365
Don't mean a thing... because when I die
all of my money goes into trust.

79
00:04:57,498 --> 00:05:00,234
Jennifer'll get her share every
year, you can count on that.

80
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:05,807
But there won't be any cash to
build cities with. If you're...

81
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,878
...thinkin' of any uglies... forget it.

82
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:29,697
Mr.Markham, Bo Williamson was here
and...

83
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:31,766
Get his wife on the phone, right away.
She's in Palm Springs...

84
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:32,567
...at some health farm.

85
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:33,501
Golden Dunes retreat.

86
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:35,002
That's the one. Get her.

87
00:05:56,824 --> 00:06:00,661
She is there, isn't she?... I see.

88
00:06:01,996 --> 00:06:06,234
Well, when will she be available?
All right, thank you.

89
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:07,668
Williamson do that?

90
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:09,503
Yes, sir. He just barged right in.
When he saw it he...

91
00:06:09,604 --> 00:06:11,305
Never mind. Did you reach Jennifer?

92
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:13,674
They won't put the call through to
her. The guests aren't allowed...

93
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:15,009
...to have telephones.

94
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,378
Call her back. It's important.

95
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:20,615
I'm sorry, but they said the guests
can't make or receive calls...

96
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,283
...during their stay.

97
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:25,887
I see...

98
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:32,894
Then she's virtually incommunicado.

99
00:06:32,994 --> 00:06:37,665
No telegrams, no outside visitors.
Just wheat germ and push-ups.

100
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,535
When does she get reprieved?

101
00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:44,338
Oh, she'll be back in time for the
dedication ceremonies.

102
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,877
Thanks, Miss Sherman.
I think I love you.

103
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:54,815
I needed that.

104
00:07:13,334 --> 00:07:20,441
Beautiful! Beautiful! Hey, Freddie!
That is absolutely beautiful.

105
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:22,476
Bring that beauty back here.

106
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:25,212
What have you been doing to him,
anyway?

107
00:07:25,346 --> 00:07:26,380
He's improved a lot since...

108
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:28,649
I can see that. I can see that.

109
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:29,517
Thank you, sir.

110
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:32,420
Listen, you keep working him like
that, and I'll be back in a few days...

111
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:33,287
to check him out.

112
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:34,722
I'll take him back to the barn and
cool him off.

113
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:36,457
You better. You better.

114
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:50,404
Hey, hey, beautiful!
I don't believe this.

115
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:53,774
Hey, cool him out easy.

116
00:08:23,037 --> 00:08:23,971
Hello, Bo.

117
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:28,743
Surprised?

118
00:08:33,014 --> 00:08:34,515
What're you doin' in my car?

119
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,816
Waiting for you.

120
00:08:37,151 --> 00:08:39,086
Get yourself killed that way.

121
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:40,988
Or the reverse.

122
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:45,626
Get out.

123
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:00,808
Over there.

124
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:33,254
Thank you. Sit down, please. Thank
you very much. Well, as usual...

125
00:12:33,454 --> 00:12:38,058
...I feel like an expectant father.
But contrary to the norm, each...

126
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:41,195
...one seems to get more difficult
for me.

127
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:46,066
I'm just grateful I have so
many wonderful friends... you know...

128
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:47,601
...I'd like to also take this...

129
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:49,670
Hey! Where're you going?

130
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:51,338
Over there.

131
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:52,973
No one's allowed in there.

132
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:55,376
What do you mean no one's allowed?
I see 30 people down there.

133
00:12:55,476 --> 00:12:59,213
No one's allowed in there without
an invitation. You have an invitation?

134
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:00,948
No, I don't have an invitation.

135
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:02,650
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

136
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:06,353
You have no invitation.
So... Out.

137
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,757
Actually, I'm a Lieutenant in
the police. My name is Columbo.

138
00:13:09,857 --> 00:13:12,092
Oh, Lieutenant? Oh.

139
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:15,195
You know, I came here. I'm just
coming here to look for somebody.

140
00:13:15,396 --> 00:13:16,263
Who you looking for, Lieutenant?

141
00:13:16,397 --> 00:13:17,831
A Mrs.Williamson?

142
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:21,135
Well, I'll tell you, Lieutenant,
lotta people here.

143
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:24,805
Why don't you wander around.
Maybe you'll bump into her.

144
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:26,507
I see. Thank you very much.

145
00:13:26,607 --> 00:13:27,141
OK.

146
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:27,975
Bye.

147
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:29,810
...let me give you some details
about this building?

148
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:34,114
You've heared this before, but you
understand that it's a fantastic...

149
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:35,382
...building, really.

150
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:40,254
Yes, you see, it's to be 32 stories
high. It's revolutionary...

151
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:44,258
...in concept really... because it
won't be offices so much as...

152
00:13:44,425 --> 00:13:49,463
...living modules, almost cocoons
where a man can coordinate his...

153
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:52,599
...activities outside the context
of mere business.

154
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:59,239
In fact, if he chooses, it can become virtually
a second home, a remarkable place...

155
00:13:59,373 --> 00:14:03,610
...of mobility and freedom. I don't
know how the wives will feel about that.

156
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:08,916
In any case, these units will be
for sale for all those who qualify.

157
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,252
You were asking me about the price earlier,
we've been...

158
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:13,587
...we haven't quite figured it out.

159
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:17,024
We've been dickering around somewhere
between 30 and...

160
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:19,393
Excuse me. Excuse me.

161
00:14:21,462 --> 00:14:22,429
Something you want?

162
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:26,533
Well, I didn't mean to interrupt like this
and barge in, but I'm...

163
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:27,901
...looking for a Mrs.Williamson...

164
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:29,403
I'm Mrs.Williamson.

165
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,638
Mrs.Bo Williamson?

166
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:32,473
That's right.

167
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,108
And who might you be?

168
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:36,443
Lieutenant Columbo.

169
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,945
You called the police.

170
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:39,079
I did?

171
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,948
Well, that's what they told me.

172
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:44,418
Lieutenant, I may not be the brightest
lady in the world, but I do know...

173
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,353
...whether I made a phone call
or not.

174
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:48,622
Obviously some kind of mix-up.

175
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:53,160
Well, I'd like to get this thing
straightened out. Can anybody...

176
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:54,895
...tell me where Mr.Williamson is?

177
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:56,196
I don't know.

178
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:57,164
You mean he's missing?

179
00:14:57,297 --> 00:15:00,134
To be absent is not necessarily
to be missing, Lieutenant.

180
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:02,302
I assume you understand the distinction.

181
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:05,239
It's just that he's out of town on
business.

182
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:08,008
And really, Lieutenant, I didn't
call the police.

183
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:14,748
This is very very weird, because they
told me they got a call from...

184
00:15:14,882 --> 00:15:18,018
...a Mrs.Williamson and she said that
her husband was missing...

185
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:19,253
...and he might even be dead.

186
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:21,221
Oh... that's ridiculous.

187
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:24,057
Wait a minute... Goldie.

188
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:25,292
Who's Goldie?

189
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:27,928
My husband's first wife.
She must've called you.

190
00:15:28,162 --> 00:15:29,430
Why would she do that?

191
00:15:30,164 --> 00:15:32,666
I guess because Bo's been out of
the country for eight weeks.

192
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,437
And he came back on business for
a day and I suppose left again.

193
00:15:36,637 --> 00:15:39,873
She gets a little tense
when the alimony checks are late.

194
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,910
That's hardly a reason to call the
police.

195
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:46,213
Well, Goldie's a little possessive.
Is that the word?

196
00:15:46,814 --> 00:15:48,315
They've been divorced a long
time.

197
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:50,884
But she still can't give up the ghost.

198
00:15:51,018 --> 00:15:53,387
Mr.Williamson is a globetrotter,
sometimes he takes...

199
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:55,689
...off at a moment's notice, doesn't
even tell Jennifer.

200
00:15:56,657 --> 00:15:57,758
No kidding? Just...

201
00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:01,261
I'm sure he'll show up in a
few weeks. If you'll excuse us...

202
00:16:01,395 --> 00:16:02,629
...if you've covered everything.

203
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:14,441
Say, did you build this?

204
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:16,109
No, no. One of my staff did that.

205
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:17,110
Oh.

206
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:18,312
Come on. Do you want some?

207
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:19,513
Yes.

208
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,948
Excuse me, please.

209
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:24,618
Excuse me. Excuse me.

210
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:26,019
A little on the slow side here.

211
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:28,021
Ah, forgive me a moment.
I just wanted to stop by and...

212
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:32,626
...tell you that's a terrific building.
I mean it. I know a lot of people like...

213
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,461
...the old-fashioned stuff, but
I figure you got to keep...

214
00:16:34,595 --> 00:16:35,696
...an open mind.

215
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:37,164
You have a new fan.

216
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:38,165
Yes.

217
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:40,834
Oh, absolutely. It's just marvelous.

218
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:44,004
Tell me how did you two meet?

219
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:47,708
Mr.Markham designed a summer
house for us. It's incredible.

220
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,343
Really, it's a work of genius.

221
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:51,645
Jennifer tends to get carried away,
Lieutenant.

222
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:54,982
But you are a genius. And when
everyone sees your plans for...

223
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:57,684
...Williamson City you'll be buried
in commissions.

224
00:16:58,151 --> 00:16:59,853
What is Williamson City?

225
00:16:59,987 --> 00:17:02,756
Now I'm a superstitious guy, let's
not talk about our project till...

226
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:03,657
...it's hatched.

227
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:06,193
You'll have to excuse us, Lieutenant.
One of the obligations of...

228
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:07,528
...the trade... have to mingle.

229
00:17:07,661 --> 00:17:09,830
Oh, sure. Listen, sorry to bother you.

230
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:10,731
No bother at all.

231
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,966
Oh, don't worry about my husband,
Lieutenant.

232
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,202
Believe me, he's very much alive.

233
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:19,673
He's dead, I tell you! I can feel it
in my spine. A little lower, honey.

234
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:20,774
Ouch, that's it.

235
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:23,477
I know more about Bo Williamson
than that little lady'll...

236
00:17:23,577 --> 00:17:24,811
...learn in a lifetime.

237
00:17:24,912 --> 00:17:25,312
Yeah, but...

238
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:28,916
Lover, take my word for it. He has
shuffled off this veil of tears.

239
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:29,983
How do you know that?

240
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:33,253
Because he always calls me before he
leaves town. This time he didn't.

241
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,556
Yeah, but if he didn't call you,
how'd you know he left town?

242
00:17:35,756 --> 00:17:37,691
I spoke with the child bride.

243
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:39,126
You mean Mrs.Williamson?

244
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:44,932
The current Mrs.Williamson. I call
her the next-ex. Don't get me...

245
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:48,635
...wrong, lover. She's half my age
and twice as pretty but I like her.

246
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:54,908
Bo reached the point where he thought he
needed a younger woman, and she's...

247
00:17:55,042 --> 00:17:56,076
...better than most.

248
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:58,845
I gotta say this for you, you
a pretty healthy attitude.

249
00:17:58,979 --> 00:18:01,315
I can afford it. He pays, you know.

250
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:05,319
I tell you, lover, if gold lame was
legal tender, I'd rule the world.

251
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:07,588
That's enough for today, Miko. I'll see
you tomorrow.

252
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:09,890
Say goodbye to the Lieutenant.

253
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:15,629
Dozo yoroshiku. Columbo-san. Anata
wa suteki desu. Anone, watakushi wa...

254
00:18:15,796 --> 00:18:21,802
...anata suki desu.
Anone, dewa mata. Sayonara.

255
00:18:21,969 --> 00:18:23,670
Sayonara. See.

256
00:18:27,341 --> 00:18:28,375
She's a lovely girl.

257
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:29,676
She is a lovely girl.

258
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:32,379
Very polite. I don't know what she's
said...

259
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:34,014
but it sounded like she liked me.

260
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:39,553
Lieutenant, would you like to turn
around? I don't want to corrupt you.

261
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,294
OK. You can turn around now.

262
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:51,365
Oh, fine. The point is this,
Mrs.Williamson.

263
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:55,102
My friends call me Goldie! And
since I'm standing here practically...

264
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:57,437
...naked with you, you'd better be my
friend.

265
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:59,673
Would you mind repeating that last
sentence?

266
00:18:59,773 --> 00:19:01,842
I don't think I quite understood.

267
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:07,314
I said, since I'm standing here practically
naked with you, you better be my friend.

268
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:09,316
And my friends call me Goldie.

269
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:14,187
Oh, I see. Well, Goldie.

270
00:19:14,855 --> 00:19:17,991
Let me ask you this.
Don't you think it's possible that...

271
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,260
...your ex-husband could've
slipped up and left town...

272
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,228
...without calling you?

273
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:23,430
No way. He never forgets.

274
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:25,832
Does Mrs.Williamson know this?

275
00:19:25,966 --> 00:19:28,001
Why ruin a lovely relationship?

276
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:31,038
You mean to tell me that your
ex-husband's closer to you...

277
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:32,773
than he is to his current wife?

278
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:36,943
Lieutenant, we were married for
22 years.

279
00:19:37,044 --> 00:19:38,311
We never had any children.

280
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:41,481
So we spent a lotta time
getting to know one another.

281
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:46,053
Jennifer gives him youth. For
the rest, he comes to me.

282
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:48,655
Now, even if he leaves town
for just a few days,

283
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:51,191
he always lets me know. Every time.

284
00:19:55,796 --> 00:19:56,697
Yeah...

285
00:19:57,998 --> 00:19:59,166
It's for you.

286
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,202
Oh, thank you very much.

287
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:11,311
Hello, yes, oh, all right.
I'll be right down.

288
00:20:11,812 --> 00:20:12,913
Thank you.

289
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:16,116
They found Bo Williamson's car.

290
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,918
You see? What did I tell you?

291
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:19,586
At the airport.

292
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:24,758
I'm gonna go down and check it out, but
it really looks like he left town.

293
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:08,595
Honey, I've got gold-plated
instincts and I trust 'em.

294
00:22:09,296 --> 00:22:10,997
I am worried sick.

295
00:22:11,198 --> 00:22:15,635
But his clothes are gone, his passport,
his suitcase. And his car is...

296
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:18,705
...at the airport. What more proof
do you need?

297
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:23,043
Excuse me. Did I hear you say that
he took his passport?

298
00:22:23,243 --> 00:22:25,679
Well, it isn't here. And he spends
a lot of time in Europe.

299
00:22:26,046 --> 00:22:30,717
Oh, yes. That's right. Globetrotter.
That's what Mr.Markham called him.

300
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:34,154
I noticed that he likes
country and western music.

301
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:35,755
Does a bear like honey?

302
00:22:36,323 --> 00:22:39,192
I've tried to broaden his tastes
a little, but it's impossible.

303
00:22:39,326 --> 00:22:41,361
That noise is all he listens to.

304
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:45,532
Tell me something... do you ever drive
his car?

305
00:22:45,966 --> 00:22:47,634
Me? No, I have my own.

306
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:52,572
What's all this guff about cars and
music and passports? I feel like...

307
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:55,542
...the original voice in the
wilderness. Don't you two understand?

308
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:57,644
Bo's gone and nobody gives
a hoot!

309
00:22:58,178 --> 00:22:59,412
Who's Dr.Moss?

310
00:23:00,113 --> 00:23:01,114
What?

311
00:23:01,281 --> 00:23:05,552
I see in your husband's appointment
book, "Dr.Moss, 10:45".

312
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:07,120
...the 11th of the month.
That's tomorrow.

313
00:23:07,254 --> 00:23:09,489
You see? He'd never leave town
if he had an appointment...

314
00:23:09,656 --> 00:23:10,724
...with his heart specialist.

315
00:23:10,857 --> 00:23:12,058
Oh? He had a bad ticker, did he?

316
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:16,196
He has a pacemaker and his heart
works perfectly. The fact...

317
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:19,599
...that he's missing the appointment
proves it's unimportant.

318
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:21,601
Hey, look at this... Blueprints.

319
00:23:22,035 --> 00:23:23,570
What's he doing? Building a bigger
house?

320
00:23:24,137 --> 00:23:26,606
Those are the preliminary plans
for Williamson City.

321
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,141
Williamson City?

322
00:23:28,942 --> 00:23:32,913
Williamson City? I remember that.
You mentioned that down at the...

323
00:23:33,046 --> 00:23:35,582
...construction site. What is that
exactly?

324
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:39,753
It's an entire community. Churches,
schools, everything planned...

325
00:23:39,953 --> 00:23:41,888
...from fireplugs to skyscrapers.

326
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:44,324
Mr.Markham. Did he design that?

327
00:23:44,457 --> 00:23:45,258
That's right.

328
00:23:45,358 --> 00:23:48,895
I can't imagine Bo's bringing hard
cash for something like that.

329
00:23:49,062 --> 00:23:51,765
Well, there may be some things
about him you don't know.

330
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:56,303
It's possible he's a bit more
complicated than you think, Goldie.

331
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:01,508
The day he came back, he saw those
plans and Elliot said he loved them.

332
00:24:02,175 --> 00:24:04,945
Oh, then Mr.Markham saw your husband
before he left town?

333
00:24:05,979 --> 00:24:09,816
They had a meeting the day he came
back, and Elliot told me all about it.

334
00:24:37,844 --> 00:24:38,845
Are you a policeman?

335
00:24:38,945 --> 00:24:41,748
Yes, ma'am. My name is Lieutenant
Columbo.

336
00:24:41,915 --> 00:24:43,450
Excuse me for just one moment.

337
00:24:43,616 --> 00:24:47,020
I was out at the construction site,
I don't know if you remember me or not.

338
00:24:47,187 --> 00:24:48,655
Well... is something wrong?

339
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:52,592
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. I wanted
to speak to Mr.Markham.

340
00:24:52,726 --> 00:24:53,293
Is he in there?

341
00:24:53,426 --> 00:24:55,395
I'm sorry, Lieutenant, he
isn't in.

342
00:24:55,862 --> 00:24:58,765
Well, maybe I could speak to him
at home.

343
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:02,569
He only goes there to sleep. If you want
him, you'll find him at the university...

344
00:25:02,702 --> 00:25:04,170
...giving a lecture to his students.

345
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,238
Oh, really?

346
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:06,606
He teaches too, huh?

347
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,175
Mr.Markham feels he has a
responsibility to share...

348
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:10,043
...his knowledge.

349
00:25:10,143 --> 00:25:11,344
I'll tell you something.

350
00:25:11,444 --> 00:25:13,780
It's a wonder the man finds all the
time, right?

351
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:19,019
Pure energy, Lieutenant. He's a
dynamo. A man like that throws off...

352
00:25:19,152 --> 00:25:22,756
...sparks and never slows down.
Most of us can't keep up with him.

353
00:25:23,556 --> 00:25:27,260
But we love it, naturally.
I mean...

354
00:25:27,394 --> 00:25:30,230
everyone likes to feel he's participating
in something important.

355
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,933
He's an unusual man. Tonight's
lecture for instance,

356
00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:37,704
on Egyptian architecture. Pyramids,
tombs. Things like that.

357
00:25:38,171 --> 00:25:43,309
He gave up his dinner hour to verify a
date. Not the year, mind you, the date.

358
00:25:44,778 --> 00:25:51,251
Lieutenant? Lieutenant? Lieutenant.

359
00:25:53,153 --> 00:25:54,387
Is this where he works?

360
00:25:54,521 --> 00:25:55,688
Yes, it is.

361
00:25:55,922 --> 00:25:57,057
Just wonderful.

362
00:25:58,792 --> 00:26:00,060
Marvelous office.

363
00:26:00,193 --> 00:26:01,394
Yes, it is.

364
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:02,829
Spacious.

365
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:04,130
Yes, it is.

366
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:06,499
Conference room?

367
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:07,934
Yes, it is.

368
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:09,736
Very handy, isn't it?

369
00:26:09,836 --> 00:26:11,271
Yes, it is.

370
00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:14,874
Wonderful. I mean everything, the décor,
the paneling

371
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:18,378
I'm glad you like it, Lieutenant.
But really Mr.Markham doesn't...

372
00:26:18,478 --> 00:26:19,479
...permit anyone in his office.

373
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:20,947
I see he likes music.

374
00:26:21,314 --> 00:26:22,082
Yes.

375
00:26:22,182 --> 00:26:23,583
He has it right here in the office, huh?

376
00:26:23,716 --> 00:26:25,285
Yes, he does. He plays it while he's
designing.

377
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:28,922
Classical stuff?
My favorite. Just love it.

378
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:52,645
Really, Lieutenant, it's getting late.

379
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:54,147
And I have to meet someone for
dinner.

380
00:26:54,247 --> 00:26:58,351
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
hold you up like that. Forgive me.

381
00:26:58,518 --> 00:27:01,454
It's just when I start hearing this stuff,
I could just listen for hours.

382
00:27:01,588 --> 00:27:02,288
I'm sorry.

383
00:27:02,388 --> 00:27:04,624
Yes. Well, if there's nothing else...

384
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:08,628
No, I don't think there's anything else.
Thank you very much. Good night.

385
00:27:08,695 --> 00:27:09,629
Good night.

386
00:27:11,931 --> 00:27:13,032
What happened here?

387
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:14,968
An accident.

388
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:23,109
Isn't that something...
Williamson City?

389
00:27:23,243 --> 00:27:25,111
If you ask me, he doesn't deserve it.

390
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:26,379
Who is that?

391
00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:30,483
Bo Williamson. I know I shouldn't
be talking about this...

392
00:27:30,884 --> 00:27:34,053
...but it's a shame Mr.Markham
has to work for a man like that.

393
00:27:34,554 --> 00:27:36,422
You mean Mr.Williamson did this?

394
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:40,894
Yes, he just barged right in here the other
day and smashed it all to smithereens.

395
00:27:42,395 --> 00:27:43,897
Guess he didn't like it, huh?

396
00:27:44,197 --> 00:27:46,099
People like that don't know what
they like.

397
00:27:46,232 --> 00:27:48,468
All they care about is what it costs.

398
00:27:48,902 --> 00:27:50,136
Too expensive, huh?

399
00:27:50,603 --> 00:27:55,175
Mr.Markham has a saying, you can't
put a price tag on genius.

400
00:27:59,479 --> 00:28:01,114
These were built over the course...

401
00:28:01,214 --> 00:28:03,950
of a generation by an endless supply
of slave labor.

402
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:07,253
Oddly enough, the pharaohs of the
time, much like ourselves,

403
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,255
were greatly concerned
with the crime rate.

404
00:28:12,825 --> 00:28:16,496
The tombs were particularly vulnerable
because the Egyptians buried vast caches...

405
00:28:16,629 --> 00:28:18,464
...of treasure along with their dead
royalty.

406
00:28:18,598 --> 00:28:23,102
So, aside from being visually impressive,
with their bulk and simplicity,

407
00:28:23,603 --> 00:28:26,839
the tombs were also a marvel of
engineering skills,

408
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,442
built to withstand the onslaught
of thieves.

409
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:33,513
By the way, it's said that some of
the engineers who built...

410
00:28:33,613 --> 00:28:36,249
...the pyramids were sealed up in
their own creations to protect...

411
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:37,550
...the integrity of the tomb.

412
00:28:38,351 --> 00:28:42,889
Fortunately, today's architects are
spared that particular indignity.

413
00:28:43,823 --> 00:28:44,824
Lights, please.

414
00:28:46,192 --> 00:28:49,495
Next week we'll move rapidly
into the Baroque period,

415
00:28:49,629 --> 00:28:51,831
and even more rapidly
into our first exam.

416
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:56,402
Those of you with failing grades
will be permanently entombed...

417
00:28:57,737 --> 00:29:01,007
at least as far as this class is
concerned. Thank you.

418
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:29,402
Didn't know you had an interest
in scholarly pursuits, Lieutenant.

419
00:29:30,336 --> 00:29:34,774
Well, actually, I just came by to ask you
a few questions. Say, that stuff about...

420
00:29:34,907 --> 00:29:36,709
...burying those Egyptians.
Is that true?

421
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,279
According to some experts.

422
00:29:39,545 --> 00:29:42,782
Gee... I find that interesting. I
mean particularly for a fella in...

423
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:44,183
...my line of work.

424
00:29:44,317 --> 00:29:44,851
Why?

425
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:48,755
Well, you know, the idea of burying a
body in a place where you can't find it.

426
00:29:49,155 --> 00:29:52,859
If I ever murdered anybody,
that's what I would do.

427
00:29:53,693 --> 00:29:57,430
Not many people have access to
the pyramids, Lieutenant.

428
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,999
Oh, you wouldn't put 'em in the pyramids
today.

429
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:05,171
No, today, you'd have to find another
place like... gee, I don't know.

430
00:30:06,606 --> 00:30:07,540
You'd have to...

431
00:30:07,674 --> 00:30:10,276
Like the foundation of a building?

432
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:14,447
You know, now that you mention it,
that would be a terrific place.

433
00:30:14,881 --> 00:30:19,485
I mean, you put a body under a building,
you would find it for a hundred years.

434
00:30:19,886 --> 00:30:23,923
I'll keep that in mind, Lieutenant,
in case I kill somebody. Now...

435
00:30:24,057 --> 00:30:26,726
...if you'll get to your questions...
I haven't had any dinner.

436
00:30:27,193 --> 00:30:30,863
Gee... you know, neither have I.
I can offer you some raisins.

437
00:30:31,698 --> 00:30:32,899
No... no, thank you.

438
00:30:33,466 --> 00:30:35,201
I'll tell you why I came by...

439
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:36,736
Would you get that board for me?

440
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,171
Oh, certainly.

441
00:30:41,307 --> 00:30:44,977
I came by because I'm still looking into
the disappearance of this...

442
00:30:45,078 --> 00:30:46,412
Bo Williamson fella.

443
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:49,282
Disappearance? So Goldie's got you
convinced now.

444
00:30:49,415 --> 00:30:50,950
No, not necessarily.

445
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:54,287
By the way, I stopped by your office
because I wanted to talk to you.

446
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:57,156
I couldn't help noticing
that smashed-up model of...

447
00:30:57,256 --> 00:30:58,524
...Williamson City.

448
00:30:58,624 --> 00:30:59,592
What about it?

449
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:01,928
Nothing. I was just wondering
how it got broken.

450
00:31:02,562 --> 00:31:04,030
Why? Why do I have the feeling...

451
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:06,566
...you already know the answer to
that question?

452
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:10,470
Well, your secretary did say something
about Mr.Williamson coming in there...

453
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,772
...and she said he was kinda mad
and he kinda threw things around.

454
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:15,408
There's a perfectly simple
explanation, Lieutenant.

455
00:31:15,508 --> 00:31:17,710
Bo was angry. And for good reason.

456
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:19,846
We went ahead on the project without
his permission.

457
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:21,647
It was very undiplomatic of us.

458
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:27,420
I see. Us... Oh, you mean you
and his wife?

459
00:31:28,588 --> 00:31:31,624
Yes. Well, Jennifer is an admirer of
my work.

460
00:31:32,158 --> 00:31:34,427
Yeah, she told me that.

461
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:43,569
In any event, Bo came back from
his trip and he saw the plans.

462
00:31:43,703 --> 00:31:47,039
It took him by surprise. Bo's a
volatile Texan,

463
00:31:47,173 --> 00:31:49,776
and when he gets angry, it shows.

464
00:31:50,176 --> 00:31:54,046
Fortunately, when I explained the
project to him he was delighted.

465
00:31:54,213 --> 00:31:57,316
I see. Happy ending?

466
00:31:59,152 --> 00:32:01,954
But won't his disappearance interfere
with...

467
00:32:02,188 --> 00:32:03,623
...your plans to move ahead?

468
00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:07,126
Are we really back to that?
Lieutenant, all the evidence...

469
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:09,228
...indicates that he simply left
the country.

470
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:11,063
Well, we did find his car at the
airport.

471
00:32:11,197 --> 00:32:12,765
There you are. That should prove it.

472
00:32:12,865 --> 00:32:17,703
It should. But we checked out every
flight list,

473
00:32:17,837 --> 00:32:19,939
and there wasn't one Williamson
on it.

474
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,445
Lieutenant, Bo is a... he's a
high-powered tycoon. He's got...

475
00:32:25,578 --> 00:32:28,714
...exotic business interests all
over the world. Now isn't it just...

476
00:32:28,848 --> 00:32:32,618
...possible for reasons not known to
us that he might occasionally...

477
00:32:32,752 --> 00:32:34,187
...fly under a different name?

478
00:32:34,754 --> 00:32:37,256
Yes, that is possible.

479
00:32:37,757 --> 00:32:39,358
Then I wouldn't worry about it.

480
00:32:39,826 --> 00:32:42,094
Now, if you'll excuse me, a very
hungry architect would like to...

481
00:32:42,228 --> 00:32:43,696
...get himself some dinner.

482
00:32:44,497 --> 00:32:48,901
You know, what's a funny thing about
that car. Car's got a tape...

483
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:52,238
...machine in it and the glove
compartment is full of cassettes.

484
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:55,842
Every one of them is country
and western music. That's all.

485
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:58,878
And his wife tells me this man doesn't
listen to anything else.

486
00:32:59,612 --> 00:33:01,047
Nothing unusual about that.

487
00:33:01,747 --> 00:33:06,419
No. Except the radio dial was set
at 52, classical station.

488
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:08,955
Turned it on, classical music.

489
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,457
I see.

490
00:33:13,926 --> 00:33:15,428
You wanna half a candy bar?

491
00:33:15,528 --> 00:33:16,362
No.

492
00:33:17,497 --> 00:33:21,767
Anyway, it seems that whoever
was driving that car must've...

493
00:33:21,968 --> 00:33:26,372
...been listening to classical music.
It's confusing.

494
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,142
I'm sure you'll find an answer,
Lieutenant.

495
00:33:33,045 --> 00:33:37,116
I'm certainly gonna try. Anyway,
thanks for your time.

496
00:33:39,352 --> 00:33:43,356
Oh, as for your designs...

497
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:46,526
Mr.Williamson did give you his
approval, didn't he?

498
00:33:46,893 --> 00:33:48,794
I already told you, Lieutenant.

499
00:33:48,995 --> 00:33:51,964
As soon as he got over his anger
he gave me his full support.

500
00:33:52,098 --> 00:33:54,534
Right. Thanks very much.

501
00:33:57,503 --> 00:33:59,405
You know, that's some coincidence.

502
00:33:59,572 --> 00:34:00,339
What is?

503
00:34:00,506 --> 00:34:04,844
That music thing. You're a great
classical music fan yourself, aren't you?

504
00:34:05,478 --> 00:34:07,280
I saw your record collection down
in the office.

505
00:34:08,147 --> 00:34:10,616
Guilty, Lieutenant. I like classical
music.

506
00:34:10,783 --> 00:34:13,085
Along with a few hundred thousand
other people in this city.

507
00:34:13,386 --> 00:34:17,089
Me too. I like it myself.
Enjoy your meal.

508
00:34:28,601 --> 00:34:31,437
Yeah, yeah, I know him. He's that
Texas guy. What's his name...

509
00:34:31,604 --> 00:34:35,308
His name is Williamson. He's a very
close friend of Mr.Markham's.

510
00:34:35,508 --> 00:34:36,642
Friend?

511
00:34:37,343 --> 00:34:38,444
Well, weren't they friends?

512
00:34:38,578 --> 00:34:41,147
Not the last time I seen that guy. The
last time I saw that guy...

513
00:34:41,314 --> 00:34:43,849
he looked like he was ready to wrap
a two-by-four around Mr.Markham's neck.

514
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:46,218
No kidding? When was that?

515
00:34:46,385 --> 00:34:49,455
Hey, look, Lieutenant, I got
a building to put up, all right?

516
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:50,556
I'll see you around.

517
00:34:50,656 --> 00:34:52,992
Yeah, OK. I don't want to
interfere with your work.

518
00:34:53,225 --> 00:34:54,727
But look, there's one other thing.

519
00:34:54,894 --> 00:34:58,931
Talk to Mr.Markham. I'm just in charge
of the nuts and bolts around here.

520
00:34:59,131 --> 00:35:01,300
Then you know about those columns.

521
00:35:01,968 --> 00:35:03,669
Not columns. Piles.

522
00:35:03,836 --> 00:35:08,040
Oh, piles. So that's what they're
called. Well, tell me about them.

523
00:35:08,474 --> 00:35:12,311
Well, Lieutenant. First we sink a
hollow steel cylinder in the ground.

524
00:35:12,612 --> 00:35:16,015
Then we fill it with cement, and when
it hardens, we got a pile.

525
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:17,216
That's what a pile is.

526
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:18,017
That's right.

527
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:20,820
That's interesting.
What do you do? You keep a record...

528
00:35:20,987 --> 00:35:22,054
...when you put 'em in the ground?

529
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:24,757
Have to. And which ones first.

530
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:29,528
You mean, you can tell me exactly what
day each one of these piles was sunk?

531
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:32,632
The day, the time, how long it
took...

532
00:35:32,765 --> 00:35:34,200
...and how many men I had on the job.

533
00:35:34,367 --> 00:35:37,169
Lieutenant, still obsessed with
pyramids?

534
00:35:38,371 --> 00:35:40,806
Well, it must've been that lecture,
Mr.Markham.

535
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,310
I never really noticed buildings before
but I'm interested in them now.

536
00:35:44,477 --> 00:35:46,812
Carl, you gotta check on those HVAC
estimates for me?

537
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:49,949
Yes, sir. I'll see you around,
Lieutenant.

538
00:35:51,117 --> 00:35:52,718
Hey, tell me the truth, Lieutenant.

539
00:35:53,185 --> 00:35:55,721
Are you interested in buildings
or builders?

540
00:35:56,522 --> 00:35:57,390
What do you mean?

541
00:35:57,823 --> 00:36:01,260
Well, let's look at your itinerary.
You showed up at my office...

542
00:36:01,394 --> 00:36:04,230
...at my lecture, and now at
my construction site.

543
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,133
Well, actually, I just happened to some
have spare time...

544
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:09,502
Perhaps you should spend your time
a little more productively.

545
00:36:09,602 --> 00:36:11,937
You're supposed to be tracking down
Bo Williamson.

546
00:36:12,104 --> 00:36:14,507
Now, surely you don't think he's here,
do you?

547
00:36:15,107 --> 00:36:17,743
Well, no, I don't see how he could be.

548
00:36:20,046 --> 00:36:22,281
Well, if you'll forgive me I'll go back
to my work.

549
00:36:22,448 --> 00:36:23,315
Certainly.

550
00:36:26,986 --> 00:36:31,657
I assume I can look forward to
another visit in the near future?

551
00:36:31,824 --> 00:36:34,827
Well... if anything interesting turns
up, I'll surely get in touch with you.

552
00:36:35,695 --> 00:36:36,962
I'm sure you will.

553
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:47,039
Say, do you have the time? I think
my watch is out of order.

554
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:49,675
10:30.

555
00:36:50,076 --> 00:36:53,045
I don't wanna be late. I got an
appointment at the doctor's.

556
00:36:55,848 --> 00:36:59,952
Doctor, really... I never intended
to have an exam.

557
00:37:01,253 --> 00:37:02,288
Just a moment.

558
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,795
Blood pressure's a bit low.

559
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:12,732
Well, that's normal for me.
Look, Doctor, really...

560
00:37:12,865 --> 00:37:16,402
I know, you came here to ask me
questions. But a checkup never hurts.

561
00:37:16,535 --> 00:37:18,170
Now, do you get enough exercise?

562
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:22,742
Well, I walk a bit. Doctor, listen.
I just had a police physical...

563
00:37:22,875 --> 00:37:24,443
Can't have too many, Lieutenant.

564
00:37:24,877 --> 00:37:26,378
The human machine is a delicate
instrument.

565
00:37:26,512 --> 00:37:28,514
There we go.
Now... you were saying?

566
00:37:28,647 --> 00:37:30,449
Yeah, this is what I want to know.

567
00:37:30,649 --> 00:37:32,551
Look, it's 11:20...

568
00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:35,187
Mr.Williamson hasn't shown up
for his appointment.

569
00:37:35,421 --> 00:37:37,490
Now, was this just another routine
checkup?

570
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:41,594
When you have a heart condition that
needs a pacemaker, no visit is routine.

571
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:43,329
You can roll down your sleeve.

572
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:47,967
What I mean is this, was this particular
appointment any more or any less...

573
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,435
...important than the others?

574
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:52,505
Let me put it this way. If Bo
Williamson doesn't get to me...

575
00:37:52,605 --> 00:37:54,406
...or any other specialist,

576
00:37:54,507 --> 00:37:56,609
...he's running a grave risk with
his health.

577
00:37:56,976 --> 00:37:58,043
Why is that?

578
00:38:04,383 --> 00:38:06,085
This is a pacemaker.

579
00:38:06,452 --> 00:38:07,553
You mean, it's that big?

580
00:38:07,686 --> 00:38:10,356
It runs on miniature energy cells.

581
00:38:10,723 --> 00:38:12,358
It's sort of like an electric watch?

582
00:38:12,491 --> 00:38:16,362
Exactly. It regulates a heart that
can't keep a steady beat of its own.

583
00:38:16,862 --> 00:38:20,065
Now, every year or so, these energy
cells have to be replaced...

584
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:23,869
...or the pacemaker becomes erratic,
causing the heart to malfunction.

585
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:25,437
In other words, you could die.

586
00:38:25,571 --> 00:38:26,806
Put simply, yes.

587
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,874
Is this a big operation?

588
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:31,343
No, but it is a surgical procedure.

589
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,679
Could another doctor besides
yourself perform it?

590
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:37,583
Naturally. But knowing Bo
Williamson, I seriously doubt...

591
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,685
...if he'd put himself in the hands
of another stranger...

592
00:38:39,852 --> 00:38:41,053
...no matter how competent.

593
00:38:41,187 --> 00:38:44,523
Hmmm... I see, all right, Doc.

594
00:38:44,757 --> 00:38:47,726
Listen.I want to thank you very much
for the time...

595
00:38:47,893 --> 00:38:48,694
and for the checkup.

596
00:38:48,828 --> 00:38:50,796
It wasn't much of a checkup but
you're welcome.

597
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:53,866
If you locate Mr.Williamson, tell
him to contact me immediately.

598
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:55,734
I will. I'll do that.

599
00:38:55,901 --> 00:38:57,036
Are you looking for something?

600
00:38:57,236 --> 00:38:58,470
Do you have a lighter?

601
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:00,339
You won't find one here,
Lieutenant.

602
00:39:00,472 --> 00:39:02,341
And let me give you some free
medical advice.

603
00:39:02,474 --> 00:39:04,243
Stop smoking those things.

604
00:39:04,743 --> 00:39:05,778
Well... I've been trying.

605
00:39:05,911 --> 00:39:09,415
Trying isn't good enough.
Remember... I deal in pacemakers.

606
00:39:38,811 --> 00:39:40,813
Well, lover, are you satisfied?

607
00:39:41,447 --> 00:39:43,949
Goldie! What are you doing here?

608
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:47,620
Same thing you are. Checking up on
Bo. He didn't show up, did he?

609
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:48,587
No.

610
00:39:49,922 --> 00:39:51,757
Columbo, the man is dead.

611
00:39:51,957 --> 00:39:53,726
He would never miss an appointment with
a doctor.

612
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:56,061
He was always very nervous about
his health.

613
00:39:56,195 --> 00:40:00,165
That may be, but there's no proof,
there's nothing solid to go on yet.

614
00:40:00,332 --> 00:40:02,668
Columbo, what does it take to
convince you that I'm right.

615
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:03,903
His body?

616
00:40:05,337 --> 00:40:07,473
Please, slow down.
You're running me ragged.

617
00:40:07,606 --> 00:40:09,108
That's the object of the game.

618
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:10,876
Isn't there anything you do badly?

619
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:12,244
Yes. Lose.

620
00:40:12,344 --> 00:40:14,079
I don't believe it.
Have you ever lost?

621
00:40:14,213 --> 00:40:15,915
Come on. You're doing beautifully.

622
00:40:16,348 --> 00:40:17,983
It's just that I don't get my arm back
in time.

623
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:19,818
Ready or not, I'm serving.

624
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:25,791
Oh, that's embarrassing!

625
00:40:25,958 --> 00:40:28,427
Listen, your problem is you're getting
your racket back a little late.

626
00:40:28,627 --> 00:40:29,161
Throw me a ball.

627
00:40:29,762 --> 00:40:31,096
Can't. We hit them all out.

628
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:31,897
I'll get it.

629
00:40:31,997 --> 00:40:34,633
No, let me. I'm getting embarrassed
to face you.

630
00:40:37,036 --> 00:40:41,307
In Cannes they have trained dogs to
retrieve tennis balls.

631
00:40:41,907 --> 00:40:43,943
I'll tell Bo somebody's got
something on him.

632
00:40:44,977 --> 00:40:45,945
Elliot!

633
00:40:50,215 --> 00:40:51,216
What's the matter?

634
00:40:56,188 --> 00:40:58,057
Jennifer! What's the matter?

635
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:00,893
It's Bo's hat.

636
00:41:47,139 --> 00:41:50,242
A battered, blood-stained hat by
itself means next to nothing.

637
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:53,479
Well, it looks kinda strange though,
don't you think?

638
00:41:54,847 --> 00:41:57,816
We don't even know if he was
wearing a hat... if he was killed.

639
00:41:58,317 --> 00:42:01,320
We don't. But the question is where
did it come from?

640
00:42:05,257 --> 00:42:07,159
When will the police lab have
a report?

641
00:42:07,292 --> 00:42:09,261
Pretty soon. I told them to rush it.

642
00:42:09,495 --> 00:42:10,596
I got them.

643
00:42:11,697 --> 00:42:12,498
Good.

644
00:42:12,998 --> 00:42:15,334
What did you ask her to get?
His army dog tags?

645
00:42:15,734 --> 00:42:16,502
Yes.

646
00:42:24,777 --> 00:42:26,145
Do you want a drink, Lieutenant?

647
00:42:26,445 --> 00:42:29,114
No. Thanks anyhow.

648
00:42:30,816 --> 00:42:32,885
What I could really use is a cigar.

649
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:34,286
Beg your pardon?

650
00:42:34,787 --> 00:42:37,956
Here they are, Lieutenant. I finally
found them in the attic.

651
00:42:38,123 --> 00:42:39,825
But why you want them...
I don't know.

652
00:42:39,992 --> 00:42:45,030
You see, army dog tags usually have a
blood type on them. Here it is. B positive.

653
00:42:45,697 --> 00:42:48,233
Sure glad he saved these.
Lotta guys usually do.

654
00:42:48,367 --> 00:42:50,269
I still think this is
an exercise in futility.

655
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:52,037
We don't even know if it's his hat.

656
00:42:52,171 --> 00:42:55,941
It has to be. It wasn't new,
but he had a lot of them around.

657
00:42:56,075 --> 00:42:58,110
And the brim is fixed just the way he
always wore it.

658
00:42:58,243 --> 00:43:01,613
Besides, it was custom-made, so the
label will be easy enough to check out.

659
00:43:04,817 --> 00:43:06,985
Yes? Just a moment.

660
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:08,353
Lieutenant, it's for you.

661
00:43:09,988 --> 00:43:14,593
Thank you. Hello? Uh-huh... Uh-huh.

662
00:43:16,495 --> 00:43:18,263
That's what I figured. Thank you.

663
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,269
Blood type, B positive, it's the same as
your husband's. I'm sorry, ma'am.

664
00:43:24,403 --> 00:43:27,239
Then something did happen to him.
He is dead.

665
00:43:27,372 --> 00:43:30,742
Jennifer, you're jumping to
conclusions. Don't be hysterical.

666
00:43:31,176 --> 00:43:33,612
Lieutenant, tell her that blood on
a hat doesn't necessarily...

667
00:43:33,745 --> 00:43:34,746
...mean that Bo is dead.

668
00:43:34,847 --> 00:43:36,181
Well, that's true. It doesn't.

669
00:43:36,482 --> 00:43:38,550
But I'd say we have got a whole new
ball game.

670
00:43:53,966 --> 00:43:56,335
Sorry. Strict orders.
He doesn't want to be bothered.

671
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:59,605
He's playing that music awfully
loud. Bad mood?

672
00:44:06,245 --> 00:44:09,214
He doesn't have bad moods.
Let's just say he's been happier.

673
00:44:24,296 --> 00:44:25,564
Miss Sherman?

674
00:44:30,469 --> 00:44:31,270
Miss Sherman?

675
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:32,070
Yes, sir.

676
00:44:32,171 --> 00:44:33,505
Would you get me Mrs.Williamson, please.

677
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:34,439
Yes, sir.

678
00:44:55,027 --> 00:44:55,727
Yes?

679
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:57,596
Mrs.Williamson is on the line.

680
00:44:58,463 --> 00:44:59,231
<i>Hello?</i>

681
00:44:59,398 --> 00:45:01,967
Hello, Jennifer. How are you?
Feeling any better?

682
00:45:02,067 --> 00:45:03,735
<i>I'm not sure how I feel.</i>

683
00:45:04,203 --> 00:45:06,271
<i>I just keep thinking about that hat.</i>

684
00:45:06,672 --> 00:45:08,607
Well, that's what I called you about.

685
00:45:08,707 --> 00:45:10,709
I may have an explanation for you.

686
00:45:10,976 --> 00:45:11,777
<i>What?</i>

687
00:45:12,945 --> 00:45:16,415
Well, I've got to check on a few things
before I tell you anything.

688
00:45:16,648 --> 00:45:19,751
Do you think you can arrange to have
Bo's will sent over?

689
00:45:19,851 --> 00:45:22,020
<i>Bo's will? What on earth for?</i>

690
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,155
Just trust me.

691
00:45:25,023 --> 00:45:26,158
Get out of there!

692
00:45:27,159 --> 00:45:28,961
That won't help, Goldie, I've already
seen them.

693
00:45:29,061 --> 00:45:31,763
You said you wanted to talk and
suddenly I find you...

694
00:45:31,863 --> 00:45:33,765
...poking around in my closet!
You've got no right!

695
00:45:33,932 --> 00:45:36,902
Two of Bo's old hats left over from the
old days.

696
00:45:37,035 --> 00:45:39,638
I got a hunch there were be
three on that shelf.

697
00:45:39,805 --> 00:45:41,673
I don't know what you're talking
about.

698
00:45:41,773 --> 00:45:45,811
Don't you? You planted that hat.
You manufactured the whole show...

699
00:45:45,944 --> 00:45:47,813
...just to back up your story that
Bo's was dead.

700
00:45:47,946 --> 00:45:49,448
You're reaching, mister.

701
00:45:50,782 --> 00:45:51,817
Now, what's that?

702
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,819
It's Bo's will.
It's an interesting document.

703
00:45:54,019 --> 00:45:55,787
It shows why you're so eager to
prove he's dead.

704
00:45:55,887 --> 00:45:58,090
Mister, you're farther out than your
buildings.

705
00:45:58,223 --> 00:46:01,059
According to this, the minute Bo
Williamson is officially dead...

706
00:46:01,193 --> 00:46:03,562
...you inherit 25% of his estate.

707
00:46:03,829 --> 00:46:06,965
And that's a lot of gold lame... much
more than you'll ever see in alimony.

708
00:46:07,132 --> 00:46:09,935
Now you listen to me!
You're after me for some reason...

709
00:46:10,102 --> 00:46:11,770
...and all I'm trying to do is to point
out what's plain as...

710
00:46:11,903 --> 00:46:14,840
...the nose on your face.
That will doesn't prove a thing.

711
00:46:15,107 --> 00:46:18,744
Suppose we call Lieutenant Columbo?
We'll leave it up to him.

712
00:46:18,877 --> 00:46:21,013
Uh... Listen, now. I can save yourself
the trouble.

713
00:46:21,146 --> 00:46:23,482
Ah... The omnipresent constable.

714
00:46:23,615 --> 00:46:24,750
What are you doing here?

715
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:28,520
Well, your maid let me in. She told me
you were up here with Mr.Markham.

716
00:46:28,687 --> 00:46:29,988
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

717
00:46:30,155 --> 00:46:31,156
How long were you standing there?

718
00:46:31,356 --> 00:46:34,793
Oh, not very long. I guess
I did hear the tail end of...

719
00:46:34,926 --> 00:46:35,727
...what you were saying.

720
00:46:35,827 --> 00:46:38,363
Well, then I guess you know what
kind of fertilizer this boy is...

721
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:40,065
...spreading around.

722
00:46:40,198 --> 00:46:43,402
You know, actually, Mr.Markham is making
pretty good sense.

723
00:46:43,535 --> 00:46:49,374
He'd almost make a detective. That stuff
about the will, that's good police work.

724
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:50,309
Thank you, Lieutenant.

725
00:46:50,409 --> 00:46:51,910
I thought you were my friend.

726
00:46:52,344 --> 00:46:55,681
Goldie, I am your friend.
And because I'm you're friend,

727
00:46:55,814 --> 00:46:57,616
I'd like to give you some advice.

728
00:46:58,917 --> 00:47:02,354
I think it would do you a lot of
good if you told the truth.

729
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:04,122
I am telling the truth.

730
00:47:04,256 --> 00:47:07,859
Are you? You see, I just spoke to
that nice Japanese girl that...

731
00:47:07,993 --> 00:47:09,194
...gives you the massages.

732
00:47:09,294 --> 00:47:10,095
Miko?

733
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:14,733
We had a little trouble understanding
each other. But we finally made it.

734
00:47:15,133 --> 00:47:17,736
She told me she noticed a bandaged
cut on...

735
00:47:17,836 --> 00:47:20,439
...the back of your leg this morning.
It wasn't there yesterday.

736
00:47:20,572 --> 00:47:23,608
Pure coincidence. I cut myself
shaving.

737
00:47:24,142 --> 00:47:26,645
I also went down to the Bureau of
Records and dug up...

738
00:47:26,745 --> 00:47:30,515
...your marriage license. It turns
out you and Mr.Williamson...

739
00:47:30,649 --> 00:47:33,485
...have the same blood type...
B positive.

740
00:47:33,919 --> 00:47:36,321
Very good, Lieutenant. Obviously she
took one of...

741
00:47:36,421 --> 00:47:39,191
...her husband's old hats, added some
blood from a self-inflicted wound...

742
00:47:39,291 --> 00:47:40,792
...and left it near the tennis court.

743
00:47:40,892 --> 00:47:42,828
Anything to make it look as if Bo
had been murdered.

744
00:47:42,994 --> 00:47:45,197
What about it, ma'am?
Oh, and another thing.

745
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:48,700
The lab tells me the blood is only 24
hours old.

746
00:47:50,769 --> 00:47:54,239
All right, all right... I did it.
I planted the hat.

747
00:47:55,006 --> 00:47:57,142
I was just trying to get everybody off
the dime.

748
00:47:59,177 --> 00:48:01,446
I guess I'm in trouble, huh?
Falsifying evidence?

749
00:48:01,613 --> 00:48:04,850
There's no real harm done.
Surely she didn't break any laws.

750
00:48:04,983 --> 00:48:06,752
Your help I don't need.

751
00:48:06,985 --> 00:48:09,755
Like Mr.Markham says, there was no
harm done.

752
00:48:09,888 --> 00:48:13,625
As far as I'm concerned, I think
everybody can forget about it.

753
00:48:14,192 --> 00:48:15,494
Well now I'll be going.

754
00:48:16,795 --> 00:48:20,265
Mr.Markham! May I borrow that will
for an hour or two?

755
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,035
I'm afraid it isn't mine.
It belongs to Jennifer.

756
00:48:24,136 --> 00:48:25,270
Why don't I take it back to her?

757
00:48:25,404 --> 00:48:27,773
I'm sure dropping it off will take
you out of your way.

758
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:29,841
Suit yourself.

759
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:49,361
Let me ask you this question.

760
00:48:50,128 --> 00:48:52,097
Is this the first pile iron you sunk?

761
00:48:52,731 --> 00:48:56,868
That's pile D-3. We did that the
day of the dedication.

762
00:48:57,068 --> 00:48:59,070
You were here, remember I saw you
coming in.

763
00:48:59,237 --> 00:49:01,006
Well, what happens then?
You just dig a hole...

764
00:49:01,139 --> 00:49:02,607
...and you just plop the stuff in?

765
00:49:02,741 --> 00:49:04,643
We usually dig 'em the day before.

766
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:08,413
I see. Then you have this big hole
sitting there all night.

767
00:49:09,414 --> 00:49:12,317
It's not a safety hazard, Lieutenant.
Don't worry about it.

768
00:49:12,451 --> 00:49:13,952
I see...

769
00:49:18,757 --> 00:49:20,058
Mr.Markham.

770
00:49:33,605 --> 00:49:35,373
The Lieutenant was looking for you,
Mr.Markham.

771
00:49:35,707 --> 00:49:37,142
I'm sure he was.

772
00:49:38,176 --> 00:49:40,078
I see you have our building records.

773
00:49:40,278 --> 00:49:42,280
Yes, sir... but he wanted to
take a look.

774
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:43,849
Now, listen. I didn't think you'd mind.

775
00:49:43,949 --> 00:49:45,116
No. Of course not.

776
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:47,886
I wouldn't dampen your new
interest in architecture.

777
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:49,354
All right, Carl. Thanks.

778
00:49:50,689 --> 00:49:52,224
Lieutenant... anybody ever tell
you...

779
00:49:52,324 --> 00:49:54,426
...you're very much like an arachnid?

780
00:49:55,126 --> 00:49:55,794
A what?

781
00:49:55,894 --> 00:49:58,763
A tick. They're quite common, but
excessively tenacious.

782
00:49:58,864 --> 00:50:02,934
They hang on and they let go only
under extreme prodding.

783
00:50:03,635 --> 00:50:04,803
I never heard of 'em.

784
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:12,544
There it is.

785
00:50:12,911 --> 00:50:13,778
There's what?

786
00:50:18,149 --> 00:50:19,551
Pile D-3.

787
00:50:19,818 --> 00:50:20,785
What do you mean?

788
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:22,954
Let's dig it up.

789
00:50:23,622 --> 00:50:24,322
What?

790
00:50:24,422 --> 00:50:26,191
Come on. You know you want to.

791
00:50:26,491 --> 00:50:27,626
I don't know what you're talking
about?

792
00:50:27,792 --> 00:50:31,096
Well, it's such a marvelous place to
hide a body.

793
00:50:31,496 --> 00:50:34,933
A crew comes in and digs a hole.
The hole sits there overnight.

794
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,168
If I were a murderer...
hypothetically speaking...

795
00:50:37,335 --> 00:50:39,137
...of course, it would be made to
order.

796
00:50:39,471 --> 00:50:40,805
I'd just drive up and dump the body.

797
00:50:40,939 --> 00:50:43,875
The next morning the crew comes in and
fills the hole with concrete.

798
00:50:44,009 --> 00:50:46,111
Neat, clean, foolproof.

799
00:50:46,278 --> 00:50:49,281
Wait a minute. If you were a
murderer... hypothetically...

800
00:50:49,381 --> 00:50:52,017
...like you say, you're not gonna
tell this to the police.

801
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:55,287
Why not? You'd never be able to
dig it up.

802
00:50:56,221 --> 00:51:00,058
Besides how do you know I'm not a victim
of my own bravado?

803
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:24,883
How much would it cost? I mean,
to actually dig up pile D-3.

804
00:51:25,183 --> 00:51:26,751
Just for the sake of curiosity.

805
00:51:26,885 --> 00:51:29,220
A great deal more than your bank
account, Lieutenant.

806
00:51:29,421 --> 00:51:30,755
To say nothing of the permits,

807
00:51:30,889 --> 00:51:33,191
...assuming you got permission,
which is doubtful.

808
00:51:33,625 --> 00:51:36,294
Hmmm... probably be a mess wouldn't it?

809
00:51:36,394 --> 00:51:37,662
It's a lot of concrete...

810
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:39,097
Yeah, sure is.

811
00:51:40,265 --> 00:51:42,400
You really believe that Bo
Williamson...

812
00:51:42,534 --> 00:51:44,135
...met with foul play, don't you?

813
00:51:44,603 --> 00:51:47,872
Astonishing. There's no body,
no proof.

814
00:51:48,006 --> 00:51:51,276
Aside from Goldie's pathetic
attempt at fraud, no motive.

815
00:51:51,409 --> 00:51:53,211
Well, actually there is a motive.

816
00:51:53,578 --> 00:51:54,379
Oh?

817
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:56,815
Oh, yes. It's in Mr.Williamson's
will.

818
00:51:57,415 --> 00:52:00,318
You see, before I dropped it off at
his wife's house, I stopped by...

819
00:52:00,485 --> 00:52:03,788
...to see my brother-in-law.
He's an attorney.

820
00:52:04,456 --> 00:52:07,125
Nothing big, you understand,
but he's pretty good.

821
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:09,594
You've been very busy.

822
00:52:10,061 --> 00:52:11,696
Well, it's just part of the job.

823
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:16,267
Anyway, he tells me there's a very
interesting clause in that will.

824
00:52:17,035 --> 00:52:19,404
It says that if Mr.Williamson dies,

825
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:22,974
his wife Jennifer doesn't gain
control of the estate.

826
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:26,177
Is that so?

827
00:52:27,812 --> 00:52:31,783
Yes. Aside from Goldie's 25 percent,
the entire thing goes into a trust.

828
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:35,420
And the wife, all she gets is the
income from the interest.

829
00:52:36,521 --> 00:52:37,789
How nice for her.

830
00:52:38,089 --> 00:52:39,524
Yes, it's lotta money...

831
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:42,360
...but it's a lot less than it takes to
finance your city.

832
00:52:43,061 --> 00:52:44,896
You're proving my point,
Lieutenant.

833
00:52:45,063 --> 00:52:46,765
I have no interest in seeing Bo dead.

834
00:52:46,898 --> 00:52:48,133
I want the city built.

835
00:52:48,967 --> 00:52:51,569
Yeah, but if he's dead and
it can't be proved,

836
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:54,105
...then legally he's considered
alive...

837
00:52:54,706 --> 00:52:57,442
...which means his wife can spend
the money without restrictions.

838
00:52:57,842 --> 00:53:00,378
She can go right ahead and
bankroll your city.

839
00:53:02,514 --> 00:53:04,149
Quite a lawyer, your brother-in-law.

840
00:53:04,516 --> 00:53:07,018
Yeah. The whole family, we're kinda
proud of him.

841
00:53:08,353 --> 00:53:10,488
As long as he's giving you so much
free counsel...

842
00:53:10,622 --> 00:53:12,390
...I hope there's one other point
that he made.

843
00:53:12,557 --> 00:53:13,324
What's that?

844
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:16,828
A man can be declared legally dead
without a corpus delicti.

845
00:53:17,028 --> 00:53:19,864
But if you really want to make a case
against someone...

846
00:53:20,231 --> 00:53:22,033
...it might help if you found a body.

847
00:53:22,701 --> 00:53:23,768
Yeah, I know.

848
00:53:24,035 --> 00:53:28,840
See, I figure I gotta come up with
something concrete.

849
00:55:28,426 --> 00:55:30,195
I... uh... need some information
about...

850
00:55:30,361 --> 00:55:31,696
Just a minute, please.

851
00:55:39,671 --> 00:55:40,605
Yes.

852
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,374
I want some information.

853
00:55:43,474 --> 00:55:46,678
How do I go about getting
permission to dig up a pile of...

854
00:55:46,845 --> 00:55:48,947
...a building that's already under
construction?

855
00:55:50,081 --> 00:55:50,949
I beg your pardon?

856
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:55,453
A pile of a building that's
under construction.

857
00:55:55,587 --> 00:55:56,754
I want to dig it up.

858
00:55:58,189 --> 00:55:59,424
Regular size pile?

859
00:56:00,158 --> 00:56:00,925
Yeah...

860
00:56:01,426 --> 00:56:02,560
Ten thousand pounds?

861
00:56:03,695 --> 00:56:04,729
I would think so.

862
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:13,271
Ah... Section 346-B... Foundations.

863
00:56:14,672 --> 00:56:16,708
Do you know how much a thing like that
would cost?

864
00:56:18,276 --> 00:56:19,177
No. How much?

865
00:56:22,847 --> 00:56:25,483
See 581-D...

866
00:56:28,453 --> 00:56:29,854
Here we are.

867
00:56:32,223 --> 00:56:35,593
What's your connection,
by the way? Contractor, owner?

868
00:56:37,128 --> 00:56:40,164
No, I'm from the police. Lieutenant
Columbo.

869
00:56:40,331 --> 00:56:45,203
Well, you'll have to have a
departmental approval...

870
00:56:45,303 --> 00:56:48,606
...under regulation 613 of the
Municipal Code.

871
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,008
I see... that's...

872
00:56:51,376 --> 00:56:52,010
613?

873
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:53,378
613.

874
00:56:54,245 --> 00:56:59,851
Now, once you get that, you file your
permits, your requisition slips,

875
00:56:59,951 --> 00:57:04,656
and if the Mayor's office
approves of that, then you're set.

876
00:57:05,456 --> 00:57:07,625
Been to the Structural Engineering
Department?

877
00:57:08,526 --> 00:57:09,360
What for?

878
00:57:10,495 --> 00:57:14,732
Lieutenant, you have to show the
exact foundation to be torn out...

879
00:57:14,866 --> 00:57:16,401
...so we can make our estimates.

880
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,305
Where do I do that?

881
00:57:21,439 --> 00:57:24,242
Room 316. Down the hall.

882
00:57:24,342 --> 00:57:25,910
All right. I'll be right back.

883
00:58:02,046 --> 00:58:03,047
I got 'em.

884
00:58:03,348 --> 00:58:04,248
Good.

885
00:58:05,116 --> 00:58:05,917
Well?

886
00:58:06,818 --> 00:58:08,920
Lunch hour.
Come back at 1 o'clock.

887
00:58:54,232 --> 00:58:55,166
OK!

888
00:59:01,472 --> 00:59:02,807
How long have you been digging
here?

889
00:59:02,907 --> 00:59:04,509
Since about 8 this morning.

890
00:59:04,842 --> 00:59:06,944
And how much is this going to cost?

891
00:59:07,078 --> 00:59:07,979
I don't know.

892
00:59:08,279 --> 00:59:10,882
Inspector? How much is all this
going to cost?

893
00:59:11,482 --> 00:59:12,517
Uhh...

894
00:59:14,619 --> 00:59:16,020
He won't tell you. I'll tell you.

895
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,755
It's gonna cost considerable.

896
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:50,488
Hi, Lieutenant. You know, you can
still stop it before it's too late.

897
00:59:52,023 --> 00:59:55,326
You know I went to so much trouble
to get the permission...

898
00:59:56,527 --> 00:59:57,528
...I think I'd better go ahead.

899
00:59:57,628 --> 00:59:58,429
Well, that's up to you.

900
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:00,665
I hope you realize how much work...

901
01:00:00,765 --> 01:00:02,600
...you're causing for a great many
people.

902
01:00:02,967 --> 01:00:05,403
Well, it's a lot more than I expected.
I'll give you that.

903
01:00:17,315 --> 01:00:19,984
You should have dressed for the
occasion.

904
01:00:20,118 --> 01:00:20,852
What?

905
01:00:21,385 --> 01:00:22,320
They're taking a picture.

906
01:00:22,453 --> 01:00:25,022
You're gonna be a celebrity on
the 6 o'clock news.

907
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:27,959
All right. Come on!
Give me a break, huh?

908
01:00:28,593 --> 01:00:31,629
I wanna apologize for the press.

909
01:00:31,762 --> 01:00:33,598
I didn't realize they were gonna
be here.

910
01:00:34,065 --> 01:00:37,268
I had nothing to do with it. Must've been
a leak down in the department.

911
01:00:37,368 --> 01:00:38,302
No, I invited them.

912
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:40,271
Hope you don't mind.
I intend to make...

913
01:00:40,438 --> 01:00:41,506
a statement when you're finished.

914
01:00:42,273 --> 01:00:43,241
You do?

915
01:00:43,374 --> 01:00:45,309
Maybe I'll have a statement of
my own.

916
01:00:46,611 --> 01:00:47,979
Well, you're clutching at straws.

917
01:00:51,182 --> 01:00:53,317
Carl. You're keeping a record of
the delay...

918
01:00:53,451 --> 01:00:54,952
...in construction time, aren't you?

919
01:00:55,052 --> 01:00:56,087
Yes, sir.

920
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:57,488
All right. Fine.

921
01:00:58,823 --> 01:01:01,492
Lieutenant,I want you to know
I admire you.

922
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:02,960
Really?

923
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:04,762
You've got the courage of
your conviction.

924
01:01:04,862 --> 01:01:08,933
That's an admirable trait, misdirected
as it may be.

925
01:01:15,206 --> 01:01:17,308
Lieutenant! There you are.

926
01:01:18,676 --> 01:01:23,281
You just stay right there because
I am gonna love you to death.

927
01:01:24,348 --> 01:01:26,751
We could have used you at the Alamo.
You've got guts!

928
01:01:26,851 --> 01:01:27,685
Oh...

929
01:01:27,785 --> 01:01:29,387
Jennifer called and told me
about this.

930
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:30,855
Then she pulled the covers over
her head...

931
01:01:30,988 --> 01:01:32,723
...which is her way of dealing
with problems.

932
01:01:32,924 --> 01:01:34,292
But I'm here to give you support.

933
01:01:34,425 --> 01:01:36,060
Thanks. I appreciate that.

934
01:01:36,861 --> 01:01:39,130
Are you getting a little nervous,
Mr.Markham?

935
01:01:39,297 --> 01:01:40,097
Should I be?

936
01:01:40,198 --> 01:01:41,966
Well, it depends on what's down there.

937
01:01:42,099 --> 01:01:44,168
The usual, Goldie... bedrock and
cement.

938
01:01:44,268 --> 01:01:45,836
Hmmm... I wonder.

939
01:01:46,003 --> 01:01:46,938
So does the Lieutenant.

940
01:01:47,071 --> 01:01:49,640
But he'll have his curiosity
satisfied soon enough.

941
01:01:50,074 --> 01:01:52,343
Mr.Markham. Can I see you a moment,
please?

942
01:01:56,781 --> 01:01:59,650
Don't be intimidated.
I think he's scared.

943
01:02:04,422 --> 01:02:07,391
If this looks all right to you,
can I bring in the crane?

944
01:02:07,758 --> 01:02:09,193
All right. Bring her in, take her up.

945
01:02:09,293 --> 01:02:10,294
What's happening?

946
01:02:10,428 --> 01:02:11,429
Another half an hour.

947
01:02:13,264 --> 01:02:14,432
Another half hour.

948
01:02:15,399 --> 01:02:16,534
Nervous, Lieutenant?

949
01:02:18,035 --> 01:02:19,070
Yeah, a little.

950
01:02:19,303 --> 01:02:22,073
Why not? You're learning
architecture the hard way.

951
01:02:43,894 --> 01:02:44,795
Take her up!

952
01:04:01,706 --> 01:04:03,574
OK, fellas. Let's forget it, huh?

953
01:04:15,386 --> 01:04:17,788
Nothing here, Mr.Markham.
Not even a button.

954
01:04:47,585 --> 01:04:49,387
Well, Lieutenant Columbo?

955
01:04:53,591 --> 01:04:54,825
I guess I was wrong.

956
01:04:55,393 --> 01:04:57,228
I consider that an accurate
statement.

957
01:04:57,561 --> 01:04:59,063
Do you have a moment?
I'd like to talk to you.

958
01:04:59,463 --> 01:05:00,998
Nothing I'd like better.

959
01:05:15,579 --> 01:05:18,349
Mr.Markham, I think I owe you
an apology.

960
01:05:18,516 --> 01:05:19,750
Is that all you have to say?

961
01:05:20,217 --> 01:05:22,052
Not much. Good night.

962
01:05:23,554 --> 01:05:26,724
Carl. Fill up the excavation and
sink another hole.

963
01:05:26,924 --> 01:05:28,426
We'll pour the concrete
in the morning.

964
01:05:30,961 --> 01:05:33,197
Lieutenant, you say you owe me
an apology?

965
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:34,765
Well, you owe me a great deal more
than that.

966
01:05:34,965 --> 01:05:35,933
There's not a trace of a body.

967
01:05:36,033 --> 01:05:37,868
Not a bit of clothing, not a ring,
nothing.

968
01:05:38,068 --> 01:05:41,472
Now I'm not a police officer, but
the conclusion seems to be obvious.

969
01:05:41,872 --> 01:05:44,775
You didn't find Bo Williamson
because he isn't here and he never was.

970
01:05:44,975 --> 01:05:46,377
Stop gloating.

971
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:48,946
What's the matter, Goldie?
You should be delighted.

972
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:50,414
It means that Bo is still alive.

973
01:05:50,781 --> 01:05:53,317
The only one who's suffered here
is the Lieutenant. And me.

974
01:05:53,484 --> 01:05:54,418
Why you?

975
01:05:55,152 --> 01:05:58,055
Well, I've been suspected of murder,
my work has been delayed...

976
01:05:58,222 --> 01:06:01,158
my relationship with Bo and Jennifer
has been jeopardized.

977
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:05,463
Lieutenant, I'm sure you have a lot of
explaining to do to your superiors.

978
01:06:05,629 --> 01:06:08,365
So if you'll forgive me,
I'll be off.

979
01:06:11,869 --> 01:06:13,137
Here, put this on.

980
01:06:15,973 --> 01:06:17,408
I'm sorry, lover.

981
01:06:17,908 --> 01:06:18,943
That's okay, Goldie.

982
01:06:19,043 --> 01:06:22,146
No, it's my fault. I put the bug
in your ear.

983
01:06:22,813 --> 01:06:24,682
They're going to suspend you,
or something?

984
01:06:25,583 --> 01:06:26,450
I don't know.

985
01:06:27,184 --> 01:06:30,254
I'll buy you a drink.
I'll buy us both a drink.

986
01:06:30,387 --> 01:06:31,489
No, that's OK.

987
01:06:32,056 --> 01:06:34,058
Thank you, Goldie, you go ahead.

988
01:06:34,892 --> 01:06:38,062
I owe you one. I'll see you later.

989
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:15,152
License and registration, please?

990
01:09:23,627 --> 01:09:24,795
That was real nice, sir.

991
01:09:24,928 --> 01:09:25,796
What?

992
01:09:26,196 --> 01:09:28,232
That was a real nice piece of
driving you did back there.

993
01:09:28,465 --> 01:09:30,234
The way you panned it, the way you
pulled it over.

994
01:09:30,634 --> 01:09:32,302
Oh, thank you.

995
01:09:33,237 --> 01:09:35,572
Left front. Could've been hairy.

996
01:09:35,973 --> 01:09:39,743
Yeah, it could've been... well,
there's no real harm done.

997
01:09:39,877 --> 01:09:41,879
Thank you for stopping. I appreciate it.

998
01:09:43,113 --> 01:09:43,881
Open up.

999
01:09:46,383 --> 01:09:47,484
What?

1000
01:09:47,851 --> 01:09:50,254
The trunk. You might as well get
your keys,

1001
01:09:50,387 --> 01:09:51,855
and I'll help you out with the spare.

1002
01:10:15,079 --> 01:10:16,213
Isn't that ridiculous!

1003
01:10:16,346 --> 01:10:17,314
What?

1004
01:10:18,382 --> 01:10:21,719
My spare... no air. It's useless.

1005
01:10:21,852 --> 01:10:25,189
I've been meaning to get it filled,
but you know how it is.

1006
01:10:25,289 --> 01:10:28,459
Well, why don't I call a tow truck?
They'll bring out a pump.

1007
01:10:28,959 --> 01:10:31,128
Oh, yeah. That's great. Thanks a lot.

1008
01:10:32,563 --> 01:10:33,464
Good night now.

1009
01:11:48,405 --> 01:11:49,840
Good evening, Mr.Markham.

1010
01:11:53,076 --> 01:11:54,211
Bo Williamson?

1011
01:12:01,451 --> 01:12:03,086
Ahead of me all the way,
weren't you?

1012
01:12:04,021 --> 01:12:05,589
Well, I kinda had a hunch.

1013
01:12:07,391 --> 01:12:10,961
You see, you kept trying to finesse me
into digging up that pile.

1014
01:12:11,228 --> 01:12:15,632
And I had to ask myself why. I mean,
you're not a dumb man, Mr.Markham.

1015
01:12:16,033 --> 01:12:18,035
You wouldn't lead me right to the body.

1016
01:12:18,535 --> 01:12:19,503
Then why did you dug it up?

1017
01:12:19,837 --> 01:12:21,605
I had to play along, didn't I?

1018
01:12:23,106 --> 01:12:26,243
You see, I figured you had the body
somewhere.

1019
01:12:26,343 --> 01:12:29,446
But what you really wanted was a fool
proof hiding place.

1020
01:12:30,047 --> 01:12:32,783
Now... what's better than a place
that's already been searched...

1021
01:12:33,183 --> 01:12:35,786
...at considerable cost and
my embarrassment.

1022
01:12:35,919 --> 01:12:36,587
Officer.

1023
01:12:36,687 --> 01:12:38,021
No, no. Don't bother.

1024
01:12:39,022 --> 01:12:41,258
You will admit it was a clever
idea.

1025
01:12:41,758 --> 01:12:45,596
Oh, yeah. It was perfect. Who would
look in the same place twice?

1026
01:12:47,164 --> 01:12:48,866
I should have left it where it was.

1027
01:12:49,132 --> 01:12:55,572
Mr.Markham, curious about that.
Where was it?

1028
01:12:57,007 --> 01:12:58,942
It was in the equipment shed
at his stables.

1029
01:12:59,643 --> 01:13:01,778
You never can be sure about
those things.

1030
01:13:02,813 --> 01:13:05,015
You know, bodies have a funny way of
surfacing.

1031
01:13:05,449 --> 01:13:06,984
No, this was brilliant.

1032
01:13:07,251 --> 01:13:09,887
Eventually you would've had a whole
building over the grave.

1033
01:13:10,654 --> 01:13:11,755
Yes, brilliant.

1034
01:13:12,155 --> 01:13:14,358
It was just that music thing that
bothered me.

1035
01:13:15,092 --> 01:13:17,995
Carnegie Hall and Nashville,
they don't mix.

1036
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:22,933
No, no they don't.
