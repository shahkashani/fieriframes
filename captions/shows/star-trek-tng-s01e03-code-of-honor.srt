00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:12,013
<i>Captain's log, stardate 41235.25.</i>

2
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,765
<i>Our location, planet Ligon II,</i>

3
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:20,396
<i>source of a rare vaccine needed
on Federation planet Styris IV.</i>

4
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:23,357
<i>Starfleet has instructed me
to engage in</i> a <i>friendly visit</i>

5
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:28,904
<i>and open treaty negotiations
to acquire this medicinal substance.</i>

6
00:00:29,113 --> 00:00:30,656
Standard orbit, sir.

7
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:33,075
Lieutenant Yar calling
from Cargo Bay 1, sir.

8
00:00:33,284 --> 00:00:35,953
Standing by to beam the Ligonian
welcoming party aboard.

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,496
On our way.

10
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,624
You have the helm, Mr. Data.

11
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,298
Cargo 1.

12
00:00:47,465 --> 00:00:49,300
This should be an interesting
experience.

13
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:50,509
Agreed.

14
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,970
Not only are they closely humanoid,

15
00:00:53,137 --> 00:00:55,473
but their history has remarkable
similarities to ours.

16
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:59,727
A highly structured society,
and they're exceedingly proud.

17
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,067
They've insisted on using their own
transporter device, sir.

18
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,903
It's their way, lieutenant.
Do they have our coordinates?

19
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:13,282
They have, sir. Precisely.
And they're standing by for your signal.

20
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:17,411
This is Captain Picard aboard
the Starfleet vessel Enterprise.

21
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:20,581
Please do us the honor
of visiting our vessel.

22
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:40,768
I am Lutan.

23
00:01:46,232 --> 00:01:48,275
Captain Jean-Luc Picard.

24
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:50,528
Welcome aboard.

25
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,574
These are my officers.
My second in command,

26
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:59,787
Commander William Riker,
ship's counselor, Deanna Troi,

27
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:03,374
and my security officer,
Lieutenant Natasha Yar.

28
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,376
A woman?

29
00:02:05,835 --> 00:02:10,548
- Your chief of security?
- Yes, Lutan. That is her expertise.

30
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,425
I am honored to meet your officers.

31
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:18,472
This is my secondary, Hagon.
A sample of the vaccine.

32
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:21,142
My duty, Lutan. I'm sorry,
but I'm required to inspect--

33
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,561
Out of my way, woman.

34
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:32,903
How interesting.
May we prove as surprising to you.

35
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:46,041
If I may suggest, sir. No apology.

36
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,044
In their view, it would weaken us.

37
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:52,256
Nothing concealed, captain.
Would you care to accept it?

38
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,925
Unless you care
to examine it further.

39
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:56,802
Absolutely not.

40
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:04,518
This vaccine sample is a gift of life
and we are honored at receiving it.

41
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:11,317
Would you do us the additional honor
now of letting us entertain you?

42
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:15,613
Yes, yes, please prepare it.
We shall join you shortly.

43
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,621
I ask forgiveness.

44
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:27,416
They are strange alien things.
You bear no fault.

45
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,126
But the female...

46
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,922
May be exactly what I have needed.

47
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:57,196
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

48
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:01,992
<i>These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.</i>

49
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:07,039
<i>Its continuing mission:
to explore strange new worlds,</i>

50
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,961
<i>to seek out new life
and new civilizations,</i>

51
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:16,799
<i>to boldly go where no one
has gone before.</i>

52
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:30,956
Lutan, we are aware of many
of your planet's achievements,

53
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:36,003
and its unique similarity to
an ancient Earth culture we all admire.

54
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,963
On behalf of the Federation,
therefore,

55
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:43,719
I would like to present this token
of our gratitude and friendship.

56
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:48,515
From China's Sun Dynasty,
14th century.

57
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:52,603
- Thirteenth century, sir.
- Ah, yes, indeed.

58
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:56,440
A most thoughtful gift.
We are pleased.

59
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:01,945
We of Ligon have been apprehensive
about strangers.

60
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,656
We are not technologically advanced
as you,

61
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:08,118
yet we possess something
you do not.

62
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:12,331
A vaccine which has been
found to be an effective antidote

63
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:16,043
against your dreaded
Achilles fever.

64
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:22,007
If you respect our customs
and we see that respect,

65
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,342
we will be friends.

66
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:28,055
And we will make the antidote
available to all who need it.

67
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:38,315
If you require respect from us,
I am sure that you will see it.

68
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:43,779
Surrounded by such friendship,
I feel no need for my guards, heh.

69
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:48,075
I will return shortly.
Prepare to transport me then.

70
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:52,621
If there is anything else,
any further courtesy...

71
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:56,625
Would it be possible to see
one of your wondrous holodecks?

72
00:06:56,834 --> 00:07:00,003
We have heard how they are used
to train your officers.

73
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:02,214
And used for many other things too.

74
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:06,427
Commander Riker, perhaps you
and Counselor Troi will demonstrate?

75
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:11,056
Would it be possible for Lieutenant Yar
to do so, captain?

76
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:14,351
Some demonstration
of defense training?

77
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,939
We've noticed you're intrigued with her
having security responsibilities.

78
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:21,859
But these things are not at all
unusual with us.

79
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,778
With us, it is the duty of women
only to own the land

80
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:28,282
and the duty of men to protect
and rule it.

81
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,910
Much the same has happened
in human history too.

82
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,997
I'd like to do it, sir.

83
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:38,375
As a sign of respect, perhaps.

84
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:43,088
- Very well.
- This way, please.

85
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,487
Aikido, one.

86
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,660
It won't move again
until my actions activate it.

87
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:18,749
You can create people
without a soul?

88
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:22,794
It's not a real person, Lutan.
It has no life.

89
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:26,048
Everything it does
is controlled by computer.

90
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:31,595
Who am I?

91
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:35,557
Do you hear me?

92
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,565
But it will feel real when it hits you.

93
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,006
A force like that cannot possibly come
from an image, Lutan.

94
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,759
Then you will show me, Hagon.

95
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:35,200
Thank you, lieutenant.
How very enlightening.

96
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,411
Aikido, vanish.

97
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:45,627
I could create two, even three,
but, really, one is enough.

98
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,671
As you fight with it, it learns,
and before long

99
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:49,631
it knows exactly how to defeat you.

100
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,093
Even the extraordinary
Lieutenant Yar?

101
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,930
It forces us to keep improving.

102
00:09:57,097 --> 00:10:03,562
Your skill impresses me.
I like you.

103
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:12,946
Farewell, my new friends
of the noble Enterprise.

104
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:16,199
Understanding has made friends
of many different people.

105
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,327
We've had a good beginning, Lutan.

106
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:22,080
May I also extend a personal farewell
to Lieutenant Yar?

107
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,624
In your Federation terms...

108
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:27,961
Picard to Bridge. Red alert!

109
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,639
Shields up.
Photon torpedoes activated, sir.

110
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,515
What com contact
have we had with them?

111
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,934
With their orbital control station, sir.

112
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:46,521
Make contact there
and on all hailing frequencies.

113
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:50,192
This is the Enterprise to Lutan
and the Ligonian government.

114
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:55,155
You have committed an unfriendly act.
We insist that you reply immediately.

115
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:56,907
Photon torpedoes ready, sir.

116
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,408
Set them for a display blast

117
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,494
a thousand meters short
of the planet's surface.

118
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,498
- Set.
- Fire.

119
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,634
Do we know the source
of their transporter beam?

120
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:19,262
Our own transporter people have tried
to trace it, sir, but to no effect.

121
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:21,306
It reads similar
to early Starfleet efforts,

122
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:22,724
but uses the Heglenian shift

123
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:25,727
to convert energy
and matter in different...

124
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:30,857
Which is actually
not important at this time.

125
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:35,070
This is Captain Picard of the
Enterprise with a message to Lutan

126
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:38,365
whom I have so far acknowledged
as a friend.

127
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:43,078
But you have now committed what
our laws regard as an attack upon us.

128
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:44,913
Since you have visited our vessel,

129
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,332
you most certainly
know the power of it.

130
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,585
We insist that you reply
to this message.

131
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:58,385
Opinion, counselor.
Will they injure Lieutenant Yar?

132
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:02,806
I believe not, sir.
They seem mainly curious.

133
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:06,601
In the case of Lutan, however,
I did feel other needs.

134
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,145
What kind of needs?

135
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:11,565
Some sexual attraction
from all the males.

136
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:14,609
Lieutenant Yar is physically
very attractive.

137
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:18,113
But with Lutan, I felt something else.

138
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,534
Something more like avarice
or ambition.

139
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,456
- Other comments?
- If I may, sir?

140
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:30,000
One of the things about them
in the briefing studies

141
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,961
was their respect for patience.

142
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,629
Strongly emphasized.

143
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:39,301
And you can see it in the precise,
ritualistic way they do things.

144
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,762
I'm worried about
Lieutenant Yar too, sir.

145
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,598
But maybe we should sit
and wait them out.

146
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:51,688
<i>Stardate 41235.32.</i>

147
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:53,315
<i>I am concerned.</i>

148
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:57,027
<i>Over a full day of waiting
with no response from Lutan.</i>

149
00:12:57,235 --> 00:13:00,864
<i>We are now testing whether they are
aware of our sensors probing them.</i>

150
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:04,910
<i>So far, we believe we have pinpointed
Lutan's government compound.</i>

151
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:09,331
- The vaccine, sir.
- Yes, doctor?

152
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:11,082
The vaccine.

153
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:16,880
I'm a physician, I've seen death.
But not on the scale this could mean.

154
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:20,300
You were testing
if you can replicate the vaccine.

155
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:21,551
And we can't.

156
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,720
The sample works fine
when used as an injection,

157
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,515
but it becomes unstable
when we try to replicate it.

158
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,434
You must get the vaccine
from the planet, captain,

159
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,228
as much as you can, immediately.

160
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,438
I'm aware of that, doctor.

161
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:36,525
You've never had to watch
a patient die from this disease.

162
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,235
That's true.

163
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:42,948
But I have seen my share of death.

164
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:47,536
Damn.

165
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:52,249
Where are the calluses we doctors are
supposed to grow over our feelings?

166
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:55,502
Perhaps the good ones
never get them.

167
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:04,511
May I speak to you about my son,
Wesley?

168
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:08,431
What? Oh, yes. Hmm, all right.

169
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:11,893
He seems quite interested
in starship operations,

170
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,937
and speaking as a mother,
of course,

171
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:16,565
he seems quite knowledgeable.

172
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,942
Well, yes, speaking as a mother.

173
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,236
He's on the turbolift.

174
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:24,656
You'll remember you ordered him
to stay off of the Bridge?

175
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,087
Wesley?

176
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:44,551
I haven't stepped one foot
on your Bridge, captain.

177
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,762
It's all right, sir,
I'll see that he leaves immediately.

178
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,932
- No.
- No?

179
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:57,439
Why don't you sit at Ops,
next to Lieutenant La Forge?

180
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,941
' Sir?
' Sir?

181
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:04,738
Is the whole ship deaf?
Sit down over there, young man.

182
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,619
Temporarily.

183
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:18,501
Captain, we have more information
from the briefing studies on Ligon.

184
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:20,503
Oh, excuse me.

185
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,506
Dr. Crusher,
some of this may interest you.

186
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:27,427
Let's hear the analysis.

187
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:28,970
It is a highly structured society

188
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,473
in which people live
by strict codes of honor.

189
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,099
For example, what Lutan did

190
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,477
is similar to what certain
American Indians once did

191
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:37,687
called "counting coup."

192
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:40,482
That is from an obscure language
known as French.

193
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,944
- Counting coup--
- Mr. Data, the French language,

194
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,614
for centuries on Earth,
represented civilization.

195
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,658
Indeed.

196
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:53,703
- But surely, sir...
- I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data.

197
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:58,541
Yes, sir.

198
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,627
Counting coup
could be something as simple

199
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,504
as touching an enemy
with a stick in battle,

200
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:04,965
or taking something
from him and escaping.

201
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,550
It was considered extremely heroic.

202
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:11,179
And under these circumstances,
Lutan considers himself heroic,

203
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:14,641
risking literally everything
in the face of our superior power.

204
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:18,353
And it fits Lutan's personality profile
as well.

205
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,690
He has an abnormally high need
for achievement.

206
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:26,194
Self image, to him, is a function
of what he thinks he's achieved.

207
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:31,324
Those who set their standards too high
can kill to meet them.

208
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,577
- Why Tasha?
- As a Starfleet security officer,

209
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:37,455
she may have represented
his riskiest prize.

210
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:42,210
Transmission from planet surface, sir.
Main viewer on.

211
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:47,882
<i>- Lutan, what do you want?
- You will display your image, please.</i>

212
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:51,928
What is required is an image
of Lieutenant Yar, well and--

213
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:54,264
<i>Are you making demands, captain?</i>

214
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:55,807
Sir.

215
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:04,774
According to the Ligon code of honor,
Lutan has done what he set out to do,

216
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:08,111
achieve recognition
for being daring and bold.

217
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,989
We've studied this
in some depth now, sir.

218
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:16,911
The proper thing for you to do now
is to ask to get Tasha back.

219
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,663
Ask for her?

220
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,541
Politely, captain.

221
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,468
And now, Lutan,

222
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:37,849
you have boldly taken Lieutenant Yar
from us and we ask that...

223
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,102
...you now please return her.

224
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:47,192
Then come visit us, captain,
and we shall return her to you.

225
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,491
Commander.

226
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:56,701
Commander?

227
00:17:57,118 --> 00:18:00,663
- That's quite formal.
- So is this request, sir.

228
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:07,545
Uh, we believe it would be preferable
if the captain led this away party.

229
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:08,755
Agreed, sir.

230
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:12,050
Their customs concerning guests
make it much preferable.

231
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,844
And I'm very much against that idea.

232
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:17,972
Lutan is clearly a liar and devious.

233
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:21,434
Counselor Troi has admitted that
she believes he's capable of killing.

234
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:24,562
It is my duty to keep
the captain from danger, sir.

235
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,856
Except that Ligonian custom
makes it clear

236
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:30,026
that a visiting leader
becomes an honored guest.

237
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:34,489
Not us,
not second in command, him.

238
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:39,619
And the custom requires that Lutan
should die rather than violate that.

239
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:47,335
Yes, it seems reasonable,
put that way.

240
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:52,549
But I warn you, if you get hurt,
I'll put you on report, captain.

241
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:11,860
Welcome to my Centerplace,
Captain Picard.

242
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:16,072
Consider yourselves
my honored guests.

243
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,992
Every hospitality
will be accorded you.

244
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:21,828
This is my First One, Yareena.

245
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,330
Lutan is a fortunate man.

246
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,833
- You've met Counselor Troi.
- Yes.

247
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,043
As on your vessel,
you have only to name

248
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,838
whatever courtesy we can provide.

249
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:34,632
Then, sir, the courtesy of seeing
Lieutenant Yar.

250
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:37,677
Lieutenant Yar
will be returned to you tonight

251
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:41,181
at a banquet
I have arranged in your honor.

252
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,058
I'd like to see her now.

253
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,561
Bring Lieutenant Yar.

254
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:50,190
I find it odd, captain,
that a man of your experience

255
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:54,569
has such difficulty
in understanding ordinary politeness.

256
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:58,740
Such as the politeness of saying
"please" before abducting someone?

257
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:04,078
The expression "please" is used only
when requesting the person back.

258
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:06,623
Yours is a different world.

259
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:11,211
With clear and simple ways
deeply rooted in our culture.

260
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:16,966
If you are willing to ask for
Lieutenant Yar's return tonight,

261
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:21,638
in front of all, honor will be satisfied.

262
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,517
One can see
the importance of honor here, sir.

263
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:29,479
Honor is everything.

264
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,238
Have you been treated well,
lieutenant?

265
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:44,035
Fine, captain. But they're showing
some signs of wear.

266
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:48,831
There isn't any need to be concerned,
captain. She's being well cared for.

267
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:53,419
My ship's company and I are certain
of your gentle wisdom in that.

268
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:56,297
Heh, for a moment,
I thought I heard a threat implied,

269
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:59,008
but that would be foolishness.

270
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:02,428
Heh, something
to be carefully avoided, I agree.

271
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:05,765
The festivities for her return to you
are in preparation.

272
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:09,936
- Shall we retire until then?
- Until tonight, Lutan.

273
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:48,182
Lutan, you have granted us hospitality
and the safety of your Centerplace.

274
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:52,937
The gifts you give us are rare
and precious. We thank you.

275
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:58,651
And now, according to the customs
of your ancestors,

276
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:01,571
whom we honor and respect,

277
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:07,035
I am here in peace to ask
for the return of Lieutenant Yar.

278
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:10,663
Well spoken.

279
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,291
There are those among my equals
in this gathering

280
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:16,461
who were wary of my approaching
the Federation.

281
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:20,089
I am proud to have taken this first step
toward a treaty,

282
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:24,093
and proud that we have something
of great value to offer you,

283
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:28,014
a priceless, life-giving vaccine.

284
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:33,686
The abduction I have done
according to our custom for all to see.

285
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:41,444
Your conduct in this matter has been
beyond exemplary, Captain Picard.

286
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:47,909
But now that the moment has come,
I find that I cannot part with her.

287
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:51,746
You speak of a code of honor.

288
00:22:51,913 --> 00:22:56,334
What you are saying now, according to
our custom, is called an act of war.

289
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:59,796
This is not an act of war, but of love.

290
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:03,674
I want Lieutenant Yar
to become my First One.

291
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:06,177
I challenge your right
of supersedence!

292
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:08,763
No woman has challenged
supersedence for over 200 years.

293
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:13,726
The right is mine and I will have it.
Natasha Yar, I challenge you.

294
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:16,521
- A struggle to the death.
- No.

295
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:20,066
The challenge
is unequivocally refused.

296
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:25,446
Then you shall have no treaty,
no vaccine and no Lieutenant Yar!

297
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:31,953
<i>Ship's log,
First Officer Riker reporting.</i>

298
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,539
<i>We have been informed of the
challenge to Lieutenant Yar,</i>

299
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:37,583
<i>and are maintaining combat readiness
around the clock.</i>

300
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:40,878
<i>We are probing Lutan's compound
deeply with our sensors now,</i>

301
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:43,005
<i>still unnoticed.</i>

302
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:51,264
Captain. Deanna.

303
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:55,435
Did you have any idea, lieutenant,

304
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,311
that Lutan was suddenly
going to announce

305
00:23:57,478 --> 00:24:00,148
that he wanted you
for his First One?

306
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:02,108
No, sir.

307
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:07,405
- Tell me what you know about this.
- Nothing, sir.

308
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:10,491
But it was a thrill.

309
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:16,747
Lutan is such a basic male image

310
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:19,542
and having him say he wants you...

311
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,837
Yes, of course it made me feel
good when he...

312
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:27,925
Troi, I'm your friend
and you tricked me.

313
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:32,889
Only so you'd think about it
completely and clearly.

314
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:37,268
We're all being manipulated,
lieutenant. Myself, most of all.

315
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:40,938
How simple all this would be
without the Prime Directive.

316
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:46,402
That thought had passed
through my mind, counselor.

317
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:56,537
What is this message from
Starbase 14?

318
00:24:56,704 --> 00:25:01,167
It's showing the infection rates,
percentage illness increases.

319
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:05,671
The plague on Styris IV
has flared up out of control.

320
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:09,509
They're estimating deaths
in the millions, sir.

321
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,261
Captain Picard, come in.

322
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:16,599
I know I can win.
Not that I'd take her life, of course.

323
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:19,435
But I'd be glad to embarrass her.

324
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:23,523
The idea of accusing me of taking...

325
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:27,276
The plague?

326
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,780
If anything,
even worse than we'd heard.

327
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:33,533
Which means they desperately
need the vaccine, sir.

328
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:36,536
And I know I can win this challenge.

329
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:39,747
You have nothing to prove here,
lieutenant.

330
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:42,792
But the vaccine is important
in this case, sir.

331
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,044
Counselor, you're the last person
I'd expect to argue

332
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:47,547
in favor of accepting the challenge.

333
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:51,217
Betazoid blood is also practical,
captain.

334
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:55,346
The odds are very good she'd defeat
Lutan's wife easily,

335
00:25:55,513 --> 00:25:58,516
and you would win
all the bargaining points you need.

336
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,685
The odds are.

337
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:06,732
You have pointed out yourself, we are
all at risk every day of every mission.

338
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:10,570
I'll want some explanation
from Lutan.

339
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,200
Lutan, why are you so obsessed

340
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:18,369
with this Lieutenant Yar?

341
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:21,664
Surely Yareena is more desirable.

342
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:24,375
Certainly she can offer you
much more.

343
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,753
She owns many things, many lands.

344
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,675
It's a great pity you began by abducting
my security officer, Lutan,

345
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:39,307
because I should tell you I do admire
the hospitality you offer here.

346
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:42,810
I am in the grip of forces
you do not understand.

347
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:46,856
Some of it I do understand.
She is a rather lovely female.

348
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:49,650
Ha, ha, you surprise me, captain.

349
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:52,737
What do you know of needs
and feelings?

350
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:58,909
Nothing. Well, almost nothing,
in my position as ship's captain.

351
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:01,704
I see.

352
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:06,751
But it puzzles me,
if you feel like that for Tasha,

353
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:09,879
why have you challenged her
to a fight to the death?

354
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:15,051
Heh, not I. Yareena.
I am merely a spectator.

355
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:19,347
Ah, but you are also a man
of great importance and wealth.

356
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,849
Great importance, perhaps,
but he do--

357
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,356
I see.

358
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:31,651
You too understand
the proper value of women.

359
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:35,529
We understand
that they are highly pleasant things.

360
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:41,535
But after all, unimportant,
except for the land they own.

361
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:44,997
You are a truly clever person, Lutan.

362
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:49,293
You stand to lose nothing,
either way the challenge goes.

363
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:55,508
Heh, a code of honor protects one,
captain, like a magic cloak.

364
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:59,387
I will order Lieutenant Yar to fight.

365
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:04,225
And may your cloak
bring you all you deserve.

366
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:19,281
Come in.

367
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,954
Why that razor, my friend?

368
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:27,623
Why not the one I adjusted
to perfect efficiency?

369
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,501
Shaving is a human art form, Data.

370
00:28:30,668 --> 00:28:34,338
Technological perfection
can shave too close.

371
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:36,590
Puzzling.

372
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:39,343
How can anything be too efficient?

373
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:42,972
Thousands of things are too efficient,
Data. At least for humans.

374
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:45,391
We always come back
to the human equation.

375
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:47,351
Exactly.

376
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:52,690
- Have you continued to work on it?
- Constantly, my friend.

377
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:55,735
Particularly the humor.

378
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,611
A man goes to a store
to buy some kidneys.

379
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,863
Oh, no.

380
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:02,199
He says to the shopkeeper,
"I'd like a pound of kiddillies, please."

381
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:04,869
The shopkeeper says,
"You mean kidneys, don't you?"

382
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:08,706
The man says,
"I said kiddillies, diddle I?"

383
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:13,586
It's too old.
And you didn't tell it very well.

384
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,672
How do you know
when something is funny?

385
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:20,176
It's not explainable. You just do.

386
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:24,013
Perhaps it is you, Geordi.
Includling the kiddillies,

387
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,307
I've told 662 jokes
and you have not...

388
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:32,188
"Includling the kiddillies."
Now, see, that's funny. Ha-ha-ha.

389
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:33,481
It was not meant as a joke.

390
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,943
The tongue slipped.

391
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:40,362
Oh, boy.

392
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:42,531
<i>Riker</i> to Commander Data,

393
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:43,699
<i>Lieutenant La Forge.</i>

394
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:47,119
<i>Report to the Transporter Room
for Away Party duty.</i>

395
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:55,586
<i>First officer to captain.
Ready with the away personnel.</i>

396
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:57,046
Lock in on this location.

397
00:29:57,213 --> 00:29:59,215
Transporter <i>locked</i> in, sir.

398
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,091
Energize.

399
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:07,765
You've both seen the message
about the plague?

400
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:10,100
And how badly the vaccine is needed.
Yes, sir.

401
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,019
We need to know as much as possible

402
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:14,021
about Ligonian armaments.

403
00:30:14,188 --> 00:30:17,775
Data, especially important is an
analysis of their combat capabilities.

404
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:21,111
Geordi, concentrate on their
cutting edges, wherever applicable,

405
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:24,031
durability, composition,
weaknesses of material.

406
00:30:24,198 --> 00:30:27,368
- Aye, sir.
- From any particular point of view, sir?

407
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:32,498
From the perspective of Lieutenant Yar
using them in combat

408
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:34,458
with Lutan's wife.

409
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,919
Most interesting.

410
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:40,923
Could this be human joke
number 663?

411
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,424
Negative, Data.

412
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,885
That's a captain's order.

413
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:47,805
Which makes it important to know

414
00:30:47,972 --> 00:30:50,266
which of these weapons
are to be used.

415
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:53,435
And that won't be known
until combat begins.

416
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,735
You're right, Data.
It does sound like a joke.

417
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:05,239
With the power of the Enterprise,
we could overwhelm this place easily

418
00:31:05,406 --> 00:31:07,908
just take what we want.

419
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:10,327
I may not understand
human humor, sir,

420
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,746
but I am
a Starﬂeet Academy graduate.

421
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:14,582
Which means, of course...

422
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:17,376
Understanding
the Prime Directive, sir.

423
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:21,422
And that is, ironically,
what this is about.

424
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:26,176
By our standards, the customs here,
their code of honor,

425
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:29,096
is the same kind of pompous,
strutting charades

426
00:31:29,263 --> 00:31:31,432
that endangered our own species
a few centuries ago.

427
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:36,812
We evolved out of it because no one
tried to impose their own set of...

428
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:39,315
I'm sorry, this is becoming a speech.

429
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:40,608
You're the captain, sir.

430
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:42,484
- You're entitled.
- Hmm.

431
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:48,157
I'm not entitled to ramble on about
something everyone knows. Carry on.

432
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:53,037
<i>Ship's log,
Commander William Riker reporting.</i>

433
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:55,831
<i>Continuing our appraisal
of Ligonian technology,</i>

434
00:31:55,998 --> 00:31:58,042
<i>the captain has made it clear
he wants Lieutenant Yar</i>

435
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:01,712
<i>beamed immediately to safety
if her life should become endangered,</i>

436
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:05,716
<i>and I fervently hope the rules
of that contest make it possible.</i>

437
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:08,177
Riker to transporter chief.

438
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:10,471
Do we have our people
on sensors yet?

439
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:12,556
<i>Their</i> general area, sir.

440
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:14,642
<i>Visual on-screen now.</i>

441
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:18,103
<i>As you see,
we're still doing some fine tuning.</i>

442
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:22,816
I've agreed to this meeting,
but I see no point to it.

443
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:25,736
You've accepted the challenge
and there's nothing further to say.

444
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:29,365
I think you should know that there
is no physical training anywhere

445
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:33,160
that matches Starfleet,
especially its security people.

446
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:37,039
And you should know that even
though these contests are rare,

447
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:40,459
we have a tradition of making
ourselves capable of them.

448
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:44,296
Yareena, my acceptance
had nothing to do with Lutan.

449
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:48,425
It has everything to do with Lutan!
Lutan wants you to be his First One.

450
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:51,845
Impossible, Yareena.
I am a career Starfleet officer.

451
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:56,350
How could you not love him?
Every woman loves him.

452
00:32:56,892 --> 00:33:02,147
I fight for the vaccine.
That's the truth.

453
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:09,571
The truth is I will kill you if I can.
And believe me, I can.

454
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:12,157
There's nothing else to say.

455
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:14,576
In my world,
it's a greater honor to refuse.

456
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:17,413
You are on our world!

457
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:28,215
Captain, I'm your counselor.

458
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:31,635
You brought me with you to Ligon
to be of help.

459
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:35,764
Then help me, please.
What is a way out of this?

460
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,766
- With the vaccine?
- Mm-hm.

461
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:39,893
None.

462
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:46,400
The weapons in that room, captain,
are surprisingly flexible,

463
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:48,318
durable and deadly.

464
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:51,113
And light, as if they were made
for women to use.

465
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,700
Hmm, some of them
still have traces of blood and poison.

466
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:56,035
- Poison?
- Hmm.

467
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:58,579
Alkaloid base. Lethal.

468
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:02,207
What about those lengths of metal
in the yard outside?

469
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:04,209
Uncertain, sir.

470
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:07,087
However, joined together they would
make a rectangle or square

471
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:09,631
enclosing 121 square meters.

472
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:13,343
If put end-to-end vertically, they would
make a pole 44 meters high.

473
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:16,555
- Or two of 22.
- Thank you, Data.

474
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:17,765
You're welcome, sir.

475
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:25,939
She won't budge. She loves him.

476
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:27,816
Without reservation.

477
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:32,446
- And she thinks I love him too.
- Most interesting.

478
00:34:32,613 --> 00:34:36,241
- Do you?
- Of course I don't, Data.

479
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:40,412
As Troi pointed out to me, I'm attracted
to him, but that's entirely different.

480
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,289
<i>Riker</i> to captain.

481
00:34:42,456 --> 00:34:43,999
Go ahead, Riker. We're alone.

482
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:47,377
<i>We're fine tuned enough
to see your hosts gathering</i>

483
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:49,671
<i>in the open area outside, sir.</i>

484
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:52,382
<i>Three of them are heading
for your location.</i>

485
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,802
Thank you, Number One.

486
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:57,304
Lieutenant, do you still feel

487
00:34:57,471 --> 00:34:59,723
that you want to go through
with this challenge?

488
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:04,353
- Do you judge your condition good?
- I judge it excellent, sir.

489
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:15,697
Your weapons, Lieutenant Yar.
You may choose your size.

490
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:34,466
Tasha, don't touch
the spines. They're poisoned.

491
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:38,595
If you're not careful,
you could kill yourself.

492
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,432
These I understand.

493
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:21,597
<i>First Officer's log, supplemental.</i>

494
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:23,599
<i>Captain Picard,
faced with a critical need</i>

495
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,893
<i>for a vaccine produced
on this planet,</i>

496
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:30,147
<i>has permitted Lieutenant Natasha Yar
to engage in a fight to the death.</i>

497
00:36:30,314 --> 00:36:34,193
<i>I have yet to understand
his reasoning or his plan.</i>

498
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:37,571
Care to lend a hand? Sit at Ops.

499
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:52,169
Was I seen leaving?

500
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:55,088
They've got eyes only for the program.

501
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:59,134
Captain Picard wanted no risk of our
communication being overheard.

502
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:01,970
You are to proceed now
as he indicated.

503
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:03,889
Captain's orders too.

504
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:05,140
Did the Captain understand

505
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:07,226
what you and Geordi reported
about these weapons?

506
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:09,895
They're razor-sharp,
split-second lethal...

507
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:12,731
I'm here to brief you
on what he plans.

508
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:29,289
- Any last minute instructions, sir?
- Stay alive.

509
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:31,583
We'll hope to do the rest.

510
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:49,393
I speak for Lutan.
The rules are known.

511
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:52,396
Let combat continue
until there is a victor.

512
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:55,565
It will not be interrupted.

513
00:38:44,698 --> 00:38:46,992
Combatants, hold your positions.

514
00:38:47,743 --> 00:38:49,369
Return the weapon.

515
00:39:20,484 --> 00:39:21,693
Careful, Yareena!

516
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,709
Move.

517
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:24,464
We're too late. She's growing cold.

518
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:27,467
Sorry, that clashes
with my instructions.

519
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:31,471
Oh, no, no, no.

520
00:40:34,558 --> 00:40:37,477
Exactly what do you find unfair,
Lutan?

521
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:40,856
They fought to the death,
you saw the final blow.

522
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:44,359
- You know the effects of your poison.
- But what of your Lieutenant Yar?

523
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:48,238
- She is to become my First One now.
- I certainly won't stop her

524
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:50,949
if she cares to claim that honor.

525
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:55,120
Remember, you have all Yareena's
wealth and lands, Lutan.

526
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:58,748
At least all has not been lost.

527
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:00,625
<i>Riker</i> to captain.

528
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,043
Picard here.

529
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,838
<i>Since you've
fulfilled your agreement, captain,</i>

530
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:07,674
<i>can we now beam
the vaccine aboard?</i>

531
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:12,012
- Ah, yes, of course.
- No problem, Number One.

532
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:13,847
Send down a medical team.

533
00:41:14,014 --> 00:41:15,932
<i>And to complete our business here,</i>

534
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:18,018
<i>we are locked on to you.</i>

535
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:22,439
Five to beam up. Energize.

536
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,494
Welcome back, captain.

537
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,246
You're wanted in the lounge.

538
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:40,916
This way, gentlemen.

539
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:58,016
She is not dead!
There was no death combat.

540
00:41:58,225 --> 00:42:03,063
You violated our agreement.
There will be no treaty. No vaccine.

541
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:06,733
The challenge was carried out.
She died, Lutan.

542
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:09,528
There was no challenge. She lives!

543
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:11,738
I am a physician and saw her die.

544
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:15,367
If you doubt this poison,
why don't you test it on yourself?

545
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:19,829
Lutan, we can provide you
with records of her death

546
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:22,666
and how Dr. Crusher
brought her back.

547
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:27,003
And at the instant of death,
Lutan, a mating agreement dissolves.

548
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:29,172
But this is witchcraft, Yareena.

549
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:31,508
To discard a mate in this manner--

550
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:35,512
Is less painful than the one
you selected for me.

551
00:42:37,973 --> 00:42:40,183
Yareena, no.

552
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:47,065
Even as I battled, Hagon,
I heard you calling out for me.

553
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:52,445
Yareena, be my First One.

554
00:42:52,696 --> 00:42:59,327
All my land and all my goods,
all I have is yours to rule.

555
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:05,166
How sad for you.
You've lost everything.

556
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:10,755
- I have my honor.
- It's such a waste.

557
00:43:10,964 --> 00:43:12,132
Do you want him?

558
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:16,094
No.

559
00:43:17,429 --> 00:43:22,058
There would be complications.

560
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:27,230
Then I will have you
as my Number Two.

561
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:30,275
Take your place, accordingly.

562
00:43:33,445 --> 00:43:37,907
Well, as you see, captain,
you may excel in technology,

563
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:40,827
but not in civilized behavior.

564
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:01,681
What?

565
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:04,309
Wesley.

566
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:09,564
Yeah, Wesley, he's been
manning that station for me. I forgot.

567
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:16,112
Well, thanks again for manning one
of our Bridge stations, Wesley.

568
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:19,324
We'll see, uh, that you have
another chance.

569
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:20,909
Yes, sir.

570
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:27,248
So, what's the delay, Number One?
Why aren't we warping out of here?

571
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:31,211
Set course for Styris IV, warp 3.

572
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:35,548
- Course laid in for Styris IV, sir.
- Engage.
