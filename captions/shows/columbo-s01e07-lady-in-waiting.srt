1
00:02:31,155 --> 00:02:33,287
You can pour Mr. Chadwick's
coffee now, Charles.

2
00:02:33,388 --> 00:02:34,254
Yes, ma'am.

3
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:38,152
Good morning. Good
morning, Charles.

4
00:02:40,917 --> 00:02:42,317
Ah, thank you.

5
00:02:46,182 --> 00:02:47,215
Good morning, Beth.

6
00:02:55,444 --> 00:02:59,043
Beth. You are sulking.

7
00:02:59,943 --> 00:03:00,442
What?

8
00:03:00,542 --> 00:03:01,808
You are sulking!

9
00:03:01,908 --> 00:03:03,041
I'm not sulking.

10
00:03:04,374 --> 00:03:08,106
Of course you are sulking.
And it isn't necessary.

11
00:03:08,538 --> 00:03:12,404
We have had our usual argument
and now the matter is settled.

12
00:03:13,503 --> 00:03:14,436
Is it?

13
00:03:17,035 --> 00:03:20,367
Beth, now listen to me.
He isn't for you, believe me.

14
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:23,032
But if you insist upon seeing
him I have a right to...

15
00:03:23,132 --> 00:03:24,932
...well, to express my feelings.

16
00:03:25,032 --> 00:03:26,631
You have no right to
control my life.

17
00:03:26,731 --> 00:03:29,962
Your life, in this case, is tied in
with an employee of the company.

18
00:03:30,695 --> 00:03:33,295
What difference does that make?
He's an honest, hardworking...

19
00:03:33,394 --> 00:03:36,027
Yes, he is. And he's ambitious,
he's intelligent...

20
00:03:36,127 --> 00:03:39,392
...he's a good attorney, and he has a
flair for the advertising business.

21
00:03:40,858 --> 00:03:46,155
And he's also smart enough to
know a golden opportunity...

22
00:03:46,422 --> 00:03:47,622
...when he sees it.

23
00:03:48,021 --> 00:03:49,554
You're not Father.

24
00:03:49,921 --> 00:03:54,218
No, I'm not your Father.
I'm your brother.

25
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:57,783
And if your choice of men friends
were more mature, believe me...

26
00:03:57,883 --> 00:03:59,350
I would stay out of your life.

27
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,849
You don't know how to
stay out of my life.

28
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,815
I won't let you be used, Beth.

29
00:04:03,981 --> 00:04:05,880
Therefore I've taken
the appropriate steps.

30
00:04:05,981 --> 00:04:07,246
Charles, car ready?

31
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,511
What do you mean you've
"taken the appropriate steps?"

32
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,044
Bryce, what have you done?

33
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:14,043
I've written a letter
to Peter Hamilton.

34
00:04:14,143 --> 00:04:16,508
He'll receive it when he gets
back from Atlanta today.

35
00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:17,475
What?

36
00:04:17,642 --> 00:04:21,140
I told him that if he continues to
see you, contrary to my wishes...

37
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,973
...his employment with Ellison
Chadwick will be terminated.

38
00:04:24,172 --> 00:04:25,938
I don't believe it. You mean
you threatened him with...

39
00:04:26,038 --> 00:04:28,837
I won't be home for dinner.
Don't wait for me, Beth.

40
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:31,102
He won't care if you fire him.

41
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:37,232
No?

42
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:42,431
Well then let me ask you a
question, Beth.

43
00:04:42,698 --> 00:04:47,529
If your name weren't Chadwick,
and you didn't have all of this...

44
00:04:48,128 --> 00:04:51,627
...do you think that... I mean...
do you really think that...

45
00:04:51,727 --> 00:04:53,959
...Peter Hamilton would
give you a second look?

46
00:04:58,723 --> 00:04:59,923
Now...

47
00:05:00,756 --> 00:05:04,421
I'm... I'm sorry if I sound cruel,
I don't mean to be.

48
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,985
But the sooner you face the facts,
the better.

49
00:05:11,518 --> 00:05:13,983
And the cheaper it will be
for all of us.

50
00:05:14,816 --> 00:05:18,214
What about the price I've paid?
First to father then to you.

51
00:05:18,315 --> 00:05:20,913
Anything I wanted to do own my own,
you or he prevented!

52
00:05:21,013 --> 00:05:23,246
Beth. This is hardly the time.

53
00:05:25,844 --> 00:05:27,377
No, it never is.

54
00:05:37,873 --> 00:05:38,806
Charles?

55
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,205
Yes, Miss Chadwick?

56
00:05:40,872 --> 00:05:42,404
Tomorrow's your day off, isn't it?

57
00:05:42,637 --> 00:05:43,571
Yes, ma'am.

58
00:05:44,103 --> 00:05:46,102
Will you be leaving tonight
with the rest of the staff?

59
00:05:46,202 --> 00:05:47,936
Well I'd planned to, Miss Chadwick.

60
00:05:48,035 --> 00:05:49,534
But, if you'd like me to stay...

61
00:05:49,634 --> 00:05:51,401
No, no. That won't be necessary.

62
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:54,365
As you wish. May I
bring you more coffee?

63
00:05:54,465 --> 00:05:56,598
Thank you Charles, no. That'll
be all.

64
00:06:07,893 --> 00:06:08,693
Hello?

65
00:06:10,026 --> 00:06:11,492
Yes, operator. Speaking.

66
00:06:12,924 --> 00:06:14,323
Darling! How are you?

67
00:06:14,423 --> 00:06:15,623
I'm going in to wheel and deal
in a minute...

68
00:06:15,722 --> 00:06:17,556
...and I thought I'd call you first
and say good morning.

69
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:20,754
Oh. You always surprise me.

70
00:06:20,887 --> 00:06:22,853
Well, that's better than
being predictable, right?

71
00:06:23,352 --> 00:06:24,252
<i>How's Atlanta?</i>

72
00:06:24,352 --> 00:06:27,318
Oh, just fine, all of it.
Hey, I miss you.

73
00:06:27,684 --> 00:06:31,116
I miss you too.
When will you be back?

74
00:06:31,216 --> 00:06:34,348
<i>Well, later tonight. I thought I'd
come right over from the airport.</i>

75
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:37,047
<i>Darling? Hello?</i>

76
00:06:37,813 --> 00:06:39,512
Darling, let's make it tomorrow.

77
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:41,811
<i>I mean it'll be I ate,
you'll probably be tired.</i>

78
00:06:41,912 --> 00:06:43,011
Well... uh...

79
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,810
No, really. Tomorrow
will be much better.

80
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,543
Mr. Gaines will see you now.

81
00:06:47,442 --> 00:06:50,341
All right, Beth. Gotta go. I'll call
you first thing in the morning.

82
00:06:50,507 --> 00:06:52,007
You do love me, don't you?

83
00:06:52,274 --> 00:06:53,872
No, I hate you with a passion.

84
00:06:54,306 --> 00:06:56,305
Goodbye, darling.
Have a safe trip.

85
00:12:01,936 --> 00:12:02,736
Beth?

86
00:12:06,034 --> 00:12:07,467
Beth? You awake?

87
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,401
Yes. Who is it?

88
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:13,232
Would you open the front door?
I've lost my key.

89
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,431
I'm in bed already.
Come in this way.

90
00:12:16,197 --> 00:12:17,563
Are they unlocked?

91
00:12:18,096 --> 00:12:19,096
Yes.

92
00:12:19,262 --> 00:12:21,461
Oh. Don't forget to
turn off the alarm.

93
00:12:21,728 --> 00:12:22,794
All right.

94
00:12:23,961 --> 00:12:25,160
It's off.

95
00:12:29,991 --> 00:12:31,723
Beth, why didn't you
turn off the alarm?

96
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,333
I don't understand...

97
00:13:25,433 --> 00:13:28,399
We found a key ring in
the bushes, Miss Chadwick.

98
00:13:28,765 --> 00:13:30,498
Does it belong to your brother?

99
00:13:30,597 --> 00:13:34,196
Yes... those are...
those were his keys.

100
00:13:34,363 --> 00:13:36,062
The front light's burned out.

101
00:13:36,161 --> 00:13:39,227
He must've dropped his keys and
couldn't find them in the dark.

102
00:13:39,327 --> 00:13:42,193
Probably walked around to
your French doors and knocked.

103
00:13:42,293 --> 00:13:47,457
I was asleep. I had taken sleeping
pills and I... I didn't hear him.

104
00:13:47,557 --> 00:13:50,322
We figure he broke the glass
and opened the door.

105
00:13:50,422 --> 00:13:53,355
I heard the glass and then
the alarm go off.

106
00:13:54,487 --> 00:13:57,186
I just woke up and
reached for the gun.

107
00:13:57,952 --> 00:13:59,518
I thought it was a burglar.

108
00:13:59,818 --> 00:14:04,049
Obviously a mistake, Miss Chadwick.
A terrible mistake.

109
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,981
I thought it was a burglar.

110
00:14:06,082 --> 00:14:13,112
A terrible mistake... mistake...
mistake... mistake...

111
00:15:29,612 --> 00:15:31,245
That does it.

112
00:17:24,494 --> 00:17:25,294
Beth.

113
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,293
Bryce!

114
00:17:27,393 --> 00:17:29,359
Y'now, the most ridiculous
thing happened.

115
00:17:29,459 --> 00:17:31,358
I've lost my key to the front door.

116
00:17:32,824 --> 00:17:34,056
How did you get in?

117
00:17:34,557 --> 00:17:35,556
With this.

118
00:17:35,756 --> 00:17:36,422
A spare?

119
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,855
Yes, I leave it in the flowerpot
by the front door.

120
00:17:38,954 --> 00:17:40,221
Why didn't you answer?
I was ringing...

121
00:19:17,844 --> 00:19:21,276
Beth! Beth! What is it?

122
00:19:21,376 --> 00:19:22,442
I shot Bryce.

123
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:23,509
You what?

124
00:19:23,608 --> 00:19:26,374
He came in my room
as the alarm went off.

125
00:19:26,473 --> 00:19:28,673
Go and see.
I want to know if he's...

126
00:19:28,773 --> 00:19:30,139
All right. All right.

127
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:32,471
Now you stay here. Stay right here.

128
00:20:10,221 --> 00:20:11,554
Beth, he's dead.

129
00:20:23,315 --> 00:20:25,881
6 Mary 102, 2 Mary 7 clear.

130
00:20:26,247 --> 00:20:30,846
12 Mary 155, restaurant information
frequency 15 clear.

131
00:20:30,978 --> 00:20:38,608
6 Mary 2 continuing, a male
45 years, 5'11, 190 pounds.

132
00:20:39,642 --> 00:20:43,439
Mary 75 Roger. Now 17 clear.

133
00:20:46,238 --> 00:20:47,438
You guys all finished?

134
00:20:48,337 --> 00:20:49,404
Okay, that's it.

135
00:20:52,036 --> 00:20:53,935
You catching up on
your reading, Lieutenant?

136
00:20:54,768 --> 00:20:56,967
No, no, not really.

137
00:21:17,925 --> 00:21:23,489
Well, I was half asleep because
I'd taken a sleeping pill.

138
00:21:23,955 --> 00:21:25,522
And the burglar alarm was on?

139
00:21:26,054 --> 00:21:28,686
Well, yes. There is a switch
beside my bed.

140
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,119
How does it work outside?

141
00:21:32,552 --> 00:21:36,283
At the front door? Well, if you
have a key and use it, then it...

142
00:21:36,383 --> 00:21:38,382
...automatically turns the alarm off.

143
00:21:38,482 --> 00:21:39,382
Ah.

144
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:43,313
Do you have any idea why your
brother went through your...

145
00:21:43,413 --> 00:21:46,479
...French doors, knowing he'd
probably set the alarm off?

146
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:52,942
I guess he lost his keys and he came
round the side of the house...

147
00:21:53,042 --> 00:21:56,907
...and tried to get in my window.

148
00:21:58,306 --> 00:22:00,639
What time did you go to bed
tonight, Miss Chadwick?

149
00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:02,972
About nine thirty.

150
00:22:03,571 --> 00:22:06,437
I didn't feel very well yesterday,
so I didn't go out.

151
00:22:07,769 --> 00:22:09,069
Excuse me.

152
00:22:09,668 --> 00:22:11,634
Did I hear you say you
stayed home today?

153
00:22:11,934 --> 00:22:13,367
Yes, that's what I said.

154
00:22:13,467 --> 00:22:14,800
You didn't go out at all?

155
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:17,599
No. No, that's what I said.

156
00:22:17,898 --> 00:22:18,664
Thank you.

157
00:22:18,965 --> 00:22:21,330
When you got there he
was already dead?

158
00:22:21,996 --> 00:22:23,295
Yes, that's correct.

159
00:22:24,429 --> 00:22:28,193
Did Miss Chadwick telephone you
after she shot her brother?

160
00:22:28,293 --> 00:22:32,159
No. I was on my way over. I stopped
at the gate when I heard the shots.

161
00:22:32,425 --> 00:22:33,258
How many?

162
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:34,357
Three.

163
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,723
The alarm was going?

164
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:37,856
That's right.

165
00:22:39,422 --> 00:22:41,987
Why did you drop by, Mr. Hamilton?

166
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,385
I came to see Bryce. I work for him.

167
00:22:46,918 --> 00:22:49,184
Can you account for your
whereabouts this evening?

168
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,317
I came in from Atlanta, I landed at
ten o'clock...

169
00:22:51,417 --> 00:22:54,015
...I took a cab from there, got into
my apartment about ten forty-five.

170
00:22:54,116 --> 00:22:56,115
You can check with the doorman.
He can vouch for that.

171
00:22:56,215 --> 00:22:59,047
Why did you turn around and come
over here after just getting home?

172
00:23:00,113 --> 00:23:04,711
It's a little involved.
Miss Chadwick and I...

173
00:23:04,811 --> 00:23:08,476
...have been seeing each other.
And Bryce objected.

174
00:23:08,576 --> 00:23:10,741
So you came over here to kind of
have it out with him?

175
00:23:11,075 --> 00:23:12,807
I suppose you could put it that way.

176
00:23:13,807 --> 00:23:15,372
Is this your newspaper?

177
00:23:16,439 --> 00:23:17,339
No.

178
00:23:17,472 --> 00:23:19,238
We found these outside in the bushes.

179
00:23:19,504 --> 00:23:22,236
Thanks. Excuse me.

180
00:23:25,035 --> 00:23:28,467
Miss Chadwick, these
your brother's keys?

181
00:23:30,732 --> 00:23:31,998
Yes. Where did you find them?

182
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:33,232
In the bushes, ma'am.

183
00:23:33,331 --> 00:23:35,664
With that front light burned out
it's really tough to see.

184
00:23:36,097 --> 00:23:40,328
Gentlemen, you have our statements.
If you don't mind, I think that...

185
00:23:40,428 --> 00:23:45,159
No, I'd like to go through this just
once more, to make sure...

186
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:46,059
...I got things straight.

187
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,492
Gentlemen, please.

188
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,925
No, Peter. That's all right.

189
00:23:49,658 --> 00:23:50,424
Go on.

190
00:23:50,524 --> 00:23:55,355
Now, Miss Chadwick, you said you
went to bed at nine thirty, right?

191
00:23:56,521 --> 00:23:59,620
And you took a sleeping pill
before you retired.

192
00:23:59,719 --> 00:24:00,686
That's right.

193
00:24:01,386 --> 00:24:04,385
Well, would you mind telling me
what happened after that?

194
00:24:06,616 --> 00:24:09,216
Well, it was after eleven...

195
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:15,946
...and I heard the glass break and
the alarm go off, and I woke up.

196
00:24:16,546 --> 00:24:17,945
You thought it was a burglar?

197
00:24:18,545 --> 00:24:21,111
Yes. Yes, I thought
it was a burglar.

198
00:24:21,677 --> 00:24:25,909
You see, it was pitch dark, and I
was half asleep because I'd taken...

199
00:24:26,009 --> 00:24:30,074
...the sleeping pill, and I heard the
glass break and the alarm go off.

200
00:24:30,807 --> 00:24:35,538
And so I reached for the gun.
It was in the drawer beside my bed.

201
00:24:36,503 --> 00:24:38,669
And then I just started shooting.

202
00:24:41,334 --> 00:24:42,967
I didn't know what I was doing.

203
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,299
Gentlemen, I will be available for
questioning tomorrow.

204
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:50,031
Right now I'd like to see that
Miss Chadwick gets some rest.

205
00:24:51,431 --> 00:24:53,263
All right fellas, wrap it up.

206
00:24:53,563 --> 00:24:54,829
Thank you very much. Goodnight.

207
00:24:57,694 --> 00:24:58,561
C'mon.

208
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:05,557
Excuse me.

209
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:09,556
Were you and your brother the
only ones that were living here?

210
00:25:10,222 --> 00:25:13,687
Yes. Well, except for Charles
and the maid.

211
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,086
My mother moved to Palm Desert
after my father died.

212
00:25:17,652 --> 00:25:18,985
Who is Charles?

213
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:20,117
The butler.

214
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:21,950
I suppose he's off tonight?

215
00:25:22,784 --> 00:25:23,716
Yes.

216
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:26,615
Great big place, isn't it?

217
00:25:27,348 --> 00:25:28,580
Well, goodnight.

218
00:26:21,657 --> 00:26:24,989
Easy, boy. Easy, fella. Easy!

219
00:26:25,622 --> 00:26:29,687
Easy! Easy now! That's right.

220
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,918
No, no, no. Not Enrico, darling!

221
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:36,385
Be nice, darling. Be nice!

222
00:26:36,584 --> 00:26:39,383
You there! Pay the cab
and bring my luggage.

223
00:26:39,649 --> 00:26:40,882
Come on, dear.

224
00:26:51,211 --> 00:26:52,477
Did she have any luggage?

225
00:26:54,143 --> 00:26:55,010
Luggage?

226
00:26:58,108 --> 00:26:59,241
Right here.

227
00:27:19,099 --> 00:27:21,198
There's ten-fifty on that meter.

228
00:27:27,928 --> 00:27:30,461
Gee, I've only got eleven dollars.

229
00:27:31,493 --> 00:27:33,692
Well, go ahead. Keep it all.

230
00:27:36,725 --> 00:27:37,957
You're a sport.

231
00:28:12,841 --> 00:28:14,208
All right, easy, boy.

232
00:28:15,441 --> 00:28:18,405
Now Enrico, come here,
come here, come here!

233
00:28:19,205 --> 00:28:22,570
Now you stop that, do you hear?
I want you to behave yourself.

234
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,736
That's a tough little
monkey you got there.

235
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:28,234
Enrico is not a monkey.
He's a pedigreed silky.

236
00:28:28,335 --> 00:28:31,534
Oh, I can see that, ma'am.
It's just a figure of speech.

237
00:28:31,633 --> 00:28:35,365
Now you stay there.
Where is my daughter?

238
00:28:35,498 --> 00:28:38,297
I don't know, ma'am.
She's probably asleep.

239
00:28:39,097 --> 00:28:40,463
Well, where's Charles?

240
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:42,795
It's his day off.
Are you Mrs. Chadwick?

241
00:28:42,895 --> 00:28:44,561
Yes. And you?

242
00:28:45,127 --> 00:28:50,192
My name is Columbo, ma'am.
I'm a Lieutenant from the police.

243
00:28:52,724 --> 00:28:55,956
Just a minute. Not so quickly.
I'd like to look that over.

244
00:28:59,788 --> 00:29:01,753
Well, I must say, you
hardly look the role.

245
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,552
Well, you know how it is.

246
00:29:04,652 --> 00:29:07,151
You... you brought my bags in?

247
00:29:07,251 --> 00:29:10,749
Yes, ma'am. The cab fare was
ten dollars and fifty cents...

248
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:13,548
...and was a fifty cent tip,
so that's eleven dollars.

249
00:29:14,048 --> 00:29:15,881
I'll see that you're
reimbursed, Lieutenant.

250
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:19,912
Now, tell me. What happened?
Where is she?

251
00:29:20,012 --> 00:29:21,145
Here I am, Mother.

252
00:29:38,771 --> 00:29:40,037
Do you feel better now?

253
00:29:40,369 --> 00:29:41,503
No.

254
00:29:42,602 --> 00:29:44,201
It was an accident.

255
00:29:44,302 --> 00:29:48,666
I don't care what it was.
You killed my son.

256
00:29:48,766 --> 00:29:49,332
Mother.

257
00:29:49,432 --> 00:29:53,131
Oh, you were always so
impossible, always.

258
00:29:53,264 --> 00:29:57,795
Blundering, making mistakes,
causing trouble wherever you were.

259
00:29:58,295 --> 00:30:02,426
He looked after her all of her life.

260
00:30:03,693 --> 00:30:07,624
He protected you and now
you've destroyed him.

261
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:10,223
Mother, you don't understand.
It wasn't my fault!

262
00:30:10,323 --> 00:30:12,222
I don't want to hear about it.

263
00:30:18,053 --> 00:30:20,919
I'm sorry Lieutenant. This must
be very embarrassing for you.

264
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:22,684
No, not really, no.

265
00:30:23,151 --> 00:30:25,616
You see, I come from a very big
family, and at dinner time...

266
00:30:25,716 --> 00:30:28,915
...it was like, well you know,
Madison Square Garden, and...

267
00:30:29,581 --> 00:30:31,080
...we used to patch it up with coffee.

268
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,214
Is that a hint?

269
00:30:32,346 --> 00:30:34,879
Well, I smelled it when I came in.
I sure could use some.

270
00:30:37,012 --> 00:30:37,711
Mother?

271
00:30:38,911 --> 00:30:42,242
I should think it would be obvious
I am in no mood for coffee.

272
00:30:46,407 --> 00:30:49,539
Ma'am, would you like me to
take your bags upstairs?

273
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:53,937
No. No, thank you.
Beth can attend to them.

274
00:30:59,135 --> 00:31:03,499
He was a special man, Lieutenant.
Very special.

275
00:31:05,765 --> 00:31:07,465
He kept us all together.

276
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:10,197
I thought you lived in Palm Desert?

277
00:31:10,997 --> 00:31:12,662
I mean spiritually.

278
00:31:13,662 --> 00:31:15,628
When my husband died I...

279
00:31:16,227 --> 00:31:18,593
...I couldn't stay in
this house any longer.

280
00:31:18,693 --> 00:31:20,525
Well, that's certainly
understandable.

281
00:31:20,892 --> 00:31:23,091
Was that when your son
took over the business, ma'am?

282
00:31:23,191 --> 00:31:27,189
Yes. And turned it into one of the
largest advertising agencies...

283
00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:28,455
...on the West Coast.

284
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:30,421
Really? Marvelous.

285
00:31:30,721 --> 00:31:33,686
He took over from my husband
in many ways...

286
00:31:34,253 --> 00:31:37,851
...including dealing with Beth
and her problems.

287
00:31:37,951 --> 00:31:38,784
Oh?

288
00:31:39,084 --> 00:31:42,415
Her choice of men, when she had a
choice...

289
00:31:42,515 --> 00:31:44,615
...has never been particularly mature.

290
00:31:44,848 --> 00:31:47,380
Oh yeah. Like that Peter Hamilton?

291
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,546
Exactly. He's an
obvious fortune hunter.

292
00:31:50,678 --> 00:31:55,077
Of course, she would have no way of
seeing through him, would she?

293
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:58,308
I'm afraid not. She's something
of a child, Lieutenant.

294
00:31:58,408 --> 00:32:01,707
Her decisions are always vague
and emotional.

295
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,706
Bryce was far more perceptive.

296
00:32:04,806 --> 00:32:06,805
He never married, did he?
Why was that?

297
00:32:07,172 --> 00:32:08,504
What are you implying?

298
00:32:08,605 --> 00:32:11,469
Oh, no offense, ma'am. No, he just
seems like a very distinctive man...

299
00:32:11,569 --> 00:32:13,869
...and a unique man and I
was curious about him.

300
00:32:13,969 --> 00:32:18,800
Well, he was. But he had far too
many responsibilities for marriage.

301
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,165
And I suppose he never met the right
woman.

302
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,631
Then there was the business.

303
00:32:25,296 --> 00:32:27,863
I don't know what's going to happen
to the company now.

304
00:32:27,963 --> 00:32:29,895
I certainly can't run it.

305
00:32:29,995 --> 00:32:32,327
And I don't want to bring anyone
in from outside.

306
00:32:32,427 --> 00:32:33,793
You won't have to.

307
00:32:33,893 --> 00:32:35,526
And what does that mean?

308
00:32:35,626 --> 00:32:37,924
It means that I'm an
officer of the company.

309
00:32:38,024 --> 00:32:39,757
In name only.

310
00:32:40,324 --> 00:32:42,489
That's because Bryce would
never let me participate.

311
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,989
Of course he wouldn't.

312
00:32:44,088 --> 00:32:46,887
You aren't even capable of
running your own life.

313
00:32:47,054 --> 00:32:49,353
I've never been allowed to
run my own life.

314
00:32:49,553 --> 00:32:51,018
Lieutenant? Won't you sit down?

315
00:32:51,118 --> 00:32:51,918
Thank you.

316
00:32:53,251 --> 00:32:55,084
But things are different now, aren't
they?

317
00:32:55,183 --> 00:32:57,416
There's a change in the status quo.

318
00:32:58,015 --> 00:32:59,882
If you're seriously considering...

319
00:32:59,981 --> 00:33:02,714
We're not alone, Mother. I suggest
we discuss this later.

320
00:33:08,212 --> 00:33:10,710
All right Lieutenant. I've kept you
waiting long enough.

321
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,809
What can I do for you?

322
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:18,373
Oh, no, no. That's all right. No, I
only have one problem and that is...

323
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,239
Cream and sugar?

324
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:21,939
I... No, I take it black. Thank you.

325
00:33:23,305 --> 00:33:25,736
I couldn't sleep last night.
There were a couple of points that...

326
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:29,036
...were bothering me so I thought I'd
come over here and clear 'em up.

327
00:33:29,135 --> 00:33:30,601
What kind of points?

328
00:33:31,967 --> 00:33:33,266
That newspaper.

329
00:33:33,767 --> 00:33:34,833
Newspaper?

330
00:33:35,465 --> 00:33:38,897
Uh, yes. The one that I noticed
on the table in the foyer.

331
00:33:38,997 --> 00:33:43,795
Now correct me if I'm wrong, but
didn't I hear you say that you...

332
00:33:43,895 --> 00:33:45,628
...were home all day yesterday?

333
00:33:45,861 --> 00:33:46,794
That's right.

334
00:33:47,561 --> 00:33:51,159
See that's what puzzles me. How
did that newspaper get there?

335
00:33:51,525 --> 00:33:53,292
Haven't you ever heard of
home delivery?

336
00:33:53,691 --> 00:33:57,789
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I have a newspaper
delivered to my house every morning.

337
00:33:58,389 --> 00:33:59,489
There's your answer.

338
00:34:00,354 --> 00:34:04,187
No. No, that won't answer it. No.

339
00:34:04,653 --> 00:34:07,951
No, the newspaper on the foyer
table, that was a late edition.

340
00:34:08,151 --> 00:34:10,617
I mean, I even saw racetrack
results in it.

341
00:34:12,249 --> 00:34:13,749
I'm afraid I don't quite follow you.

342
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:18,147
Well, if you were home all day
who brought home the newspaper?

343
00:34:19,213 --> 00:34:20,712
Well, Bryce must have brought
it home.

344
00:34:20,813 --> 00:34:23,112
Yes, but Bryce came in through your
room, he didn't come in through...

345
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:27,076
...the front door. I mean, he was
shot on that side of the house.

346
00:34:27,709 --> 00:34:30,575
How did that newspaper get to
the other end of the house?

347
00:34:30,675 --> 00:34:33,606
Lieutenant, you seem to be
cross-examining my daughter.

348
00:34:33,706 --> 00:34:35,039
That's all right, Mother.

349
00:34:36,572 --> 00:34:39,304
Bryce must have brought it in,
and in my confusion, I picked it up...

350
00:34:39,404 --> 00:34:42,203
...put it on the foyer table
when I went to answer the door.

351
00:34:42,303 --> 00:34:45,102
Yes, that would be an answer,
except for one thing.

352
00:34:46,234 --> 00:34:49,100
You left your brother's attache case
out there.

353
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,398
Why wouldn't you bring them both
in at the same time?

354
00:34:53,265 --> 00:34:54,564
I didn't see it.

355
00:34:54,864 --> 00:35:00,195
You didn't see it. Gee. They
couldn't have been too far apart.

356
00:35:00,295 --> 00:35:03,927
People are inconsistent when they
are in a state of shock, Lieutenant.

357
00:35:04,027 --> 00:35:06,325
It's foolish of you to expect
rational behaviour...

358
00:35:06,425 --> 00:35:07,825
...at a time like that.

359
00:35:07,925 --> 00:35:10,991
Well I'm sure you're probably right
about this. Y'now, I only get...

360
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:14,922
...into it because I try to figure it
out in my mind, you understand that.

361
00:35:17,155 --> 00:35:19,887
Well look, I'm sure both of you have
a great deal to talk about.

362
00:35:19,987 --> 00:35:23,618
So I'm going to run along.
Thank you for the coffee, ma'am.

363
00:35:24,918 --> 00:35:25,683
Bye bye.

364
00:35:25,784 --> 00:35:26,650
Goodbye.

365
00:35:26,884 --> 00:35:32,181
Uh, listen, about that
eleven dollars, ma'am, uh...

366
00:35:32,281 --> 00:35:34,813
If you leave me your card,
I'll send you a check.

367
00:35:35,913 --> 00:35:37,545
I'm all out of cards.

368
00:35:40,011 --> 00:35:40,644
Here.

369
00:35:46,008 --> 00:35:46,875
Thank you very much.

370
00:35:46,975 --> 00:35:48,407
Thank you, Lieutenant.

371
00:35:54,238 --> 00:35:56,037
Easy now, easy.

372
00:36:14,763 --> 00:36:16,261
The jury's coming in now.

373
00:36:39,184 --> 00:36:42,417
Have you, ladies and gentlemen,
concluded your deliberations?

374
00:36:42,683 --> 00:36:43,883
Yes sir, we have.

375
00:36:43,983 --> 00:36:44,949
Clerk?

376
00:36:50,346 --> 00:36:51,279
Thank you.

377
00:36:54,978 --> 00:36:56,077
What do you think?

378
00:36:57,111 --> 00:36:57,909
What?

379
00:36:58,009 --> 00:37:00,409
She's home free. You watch.

380
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:04,574
Jupiter and Venus are in
good aspect with Pluto.

381
00:37:06,306 --> 00:37:09,338
I have before me the verdict of the
coroner's jury...

382
00:37:09,438 --> 00:37:12,003
...in the matter of Bryce Chadwick,
deceased.

383
00:37:12,404 --> 00:37:16,469
The jury finds that Bryce Chadwick,
aged 46 came to his death...

384
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:24,298
...July 21st at his residence, 2307
Lorraine Drive, death being caused

385
00:37:24,398 --> 00:37:28,163
...by three.38 caliber bullet
wounds in the upper chest.

386
00:37:32,361 --> 00:37:35,393
The jury also finds, from the
evidence submitted...

387
00:37:36,226 --> 00:37:39,758
...that the death of Bryce Chadwick
was an accident.

388
00:37:44,923 --> 00:37:45,656
Thank you very much.

389
00:37:45,755 --> 00:37:47,022
Good luck to you.

390
00:37:47,921 --> 00:37:48,887
See?

391
00:37:49,953 --> 00:37:54,818
Thank you jury members.
This inquest is now closed.

392
00:38:05,814 --> 00:38:07,612
Nice to be believed, isn't it, huh?

393
00:38:08,179 --> 00:38:11,410
Yes. I want to take
the whole jury out for dinner.

394
00:38:12,377 --> 00:38:14,743
That is what is known as
bribery after the fact.

395
00:38:14,843 --> 00:38:15,742
Oh, is it?

396
00:38:16,009 --> 00:38:18,974
Anyway, it's all over.
Back to normal, huh?

397
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,239
Oh no. That's exactly
what I don't want.

398
00:38:23,073 --> 00:38:23,905
What do you mean?

399
00:38:24,172 --> 00:38:26,037
Well, I think it's time we
made a few changes...

400
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,769
...that I broke a few patterns.

401
00:38:29,669 --> 00:38:32,901
As long as you don't break ours.
How about some lunch to celebrate?

402
00:38:33,001 --> 00:38:37,166
Can I take a raincheck? I have
a few appointments.

403
00:38:37,965 --> 00:38:38,832
You don't mind, do you, darling?

404
00:38:38,932 --> 00:38:40,298
No, no. That's all right.

405
00:38:41,364 --> 00:38:44,263
Oh, when you get back to the office...

406
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:46,696
...would you set up a meeting with the
heads of the departments?

407
00:38:47,028 --> 00:38:48,095
What's the agenda?

408
00:38:48,194 --> 00:38:49,660
Reorganization.

409
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:51,527
Uh, tomorrow at two.

410
00:38:52,226 --> 00:38:53,059
Mother?

411
00:39:03,188 --> 00:39:04,554
Morning, Mr. Hamilton.

412
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,319
Oh, Lieutenant.

413
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,286
You remember me?

414
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:09,052
Yes, I've got a very good memory.

415
00:39:09,152 --> 00:39:11,784
I tell you, I envy you that. I got
to the point where I can't...

416
00:39:11,884 --> 00:39:13,150
...remember my telephone number.

417
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,849
What can I do for you, Lieutenant?

418
00:39:15,282 --> 00:39:19,314
Well, I couldn't help overhearing
that she turned you down for lunch.

419
00:39:19,414 --> 00:39:20,780
You want to grab a bite with me?

420
00:39:22,346 --> 00:39:24,012
You want to ask me some
questions, is that it?

421
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:28,943
Well, uh... listen. It's my treat.

422
00:39:29,643 --> 00:39:30,443
All right.

423
00:39:42,704 --> 00:39:44,103
Window down, please.

424
00:39:44,203 --> 00:39:45,769
Oh. Right.

425
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,301
That's it.

426
00:39:48,634 --> 00:39:51,067
I held the whipped cream on the
Mighty Malt, that's what you wanted?

427
00:39:51,167 --> 00:39:52,333
Uh, right.

428
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:56,665
Okay, and they were out of onion
rings. You want a substitution?

429
00:39:56,864 --> 00:40:00,030
No, that's all right. No,
that's fine.

430
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:02,695
All right. Don't forget to let me
know before you leave, I need to...

431
00:40:02,795 --> 00:40:06,227
...take the tray. People are always
driving off with our trays.

432
00:40:06,327 --> 00:40:08,259
Right. I'll remember.

433
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:08,959
Thank you.

434
00:40:09,059 --> 00:40:10,824
You're welcome. Right.

435
00:40:11,624 --> 00:40:12,324
Tell me something.

436
00:40:12,424 --> 00:40:15,223
You and Mrs. Chadwick, are you
going to be married?

437
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,588
You don't believe in
preliminaries, do you?

438
00:40:18,955 --> 00:40:21,453
Well y'now sometimes, you just...

439
00:40:21,787 --> 00:40:24,818
Yes, were going to be married but
we haven't set the date yet.

440
00:40:24,918 --> 00:40:26,518
Mainly because of Bryce.

441
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:31,116
Oh, I see. Y'now what I
was wondering was...

442
00:40:32,082 --> 00:40:35,780
...the night of the shooting, why
did you drive over there so late?

443
00:40:36,847 --> 00:40:39,079
Let's say the propulsion was anger.

444
00:40:40,278 --> 00:40:41,811
Huh? What do you mean?

445
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:44,577
Oh, I got back from a business trip
and there was a letter waiting...

446
00:40:44,677 --> 00:40:47,376
...for me from Bryce, said to
lay off Beth, or else.

447
00:40:48,775 --> 00:40:49,941
Or else? Or else what?

448
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:55,338
Oh well, it's professional
discrimination, things like that.

449
00:40:56,205 --> 00:40:58,337
So I got hot and I went over
to have it out with him.

450
00:41:00,736 --> 00:41:04,635
Boy, you got there just in time
for the commotion.

451
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:08,833
It's quite a coincidence, isn't it?

452
00:41:09,932 --> 00:41:11,632
That's a leading question,
Lieutenant.

453
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:15,396
Do you think that the two of us
did Bryce in together?

454
00:41:15,529 --> 00:41:20,694
What do you mean? Murder? No,
I mean you were at the inquest.

455
00:41:20,793 --> 00:41:21,893
They said it was a accident.

456
00:41:21,994 --> 00:41:25,092
Well, I'm not talking about
the inquest, I'm talking about you.

457
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:26,925
What do you think?

458
00:41:28,024 --> 00:41:33,421
Do I think it was a conspiracy? No,
oh, no. No chance of that. No sir.

459
00:41:33,622 --> 00:41:36,320
It's rather odd that you're still
asking the same questions though.

460
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:42,584
Oh well, y'now, that's... well, that's
just me. I mean, nothing official.

461
00:41:42,684 --> 00:41:48,881
It's just that I have this bug
about tying up loose ends.

462
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:52,380
Listen, I want to thank you.
You've been very helpful to me.

463
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:57,378
Suppose you ask the question
that you haven't asked.

464
00:41:59,277 --> 00:42:00,810
Whether or not I'm a fortune hunter.

465
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:01,742
Well, I never intended...

466
00:42:01,842 --> 00:42:07,107
I'm not. I love Beth, with her
money, or without her money.

467
00:42:07,873 --> 00:42:10,272
As a matter of fact I was quite
prepared to quit the company.

468
00:42:12,671 --> 00:42:14,804
Of course that won't be
necessary now.

469
00:42:14,936 --> 00:42:18,635
No, it won't. But I won't be a
hypocrite, Lieutenant.

470
00:42:19,101 --> 00:42:21,634
I'm sorry about poor Bryce being
killed, but...

471
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,099
...it has gotten Beth out
from under his thumb.

472
00:42:26,265 --> 00:42:29,697
Oh, yeah. Yeah, way out, huh?

473
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:31,896
What's that supposed to mean?

474
00:42:32,362 --> 00:42:36,961
Way out? Well, y'now in the
courtroom I overheard her say that...

475
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:40,792
...she was breaking patterns. Now,
this is a terrible thing to admit,

476
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:46,956
...but I think that, in a way, her
brother's death is...

477
00:42:47,056 --> 00:42:48,988
...the best thing that ever happened
to her.

478
00:43:00,417 --> 00:43:05,014
Hey, mister! You forgot the tray!

479
00:43:15,877 --> 00:43:16,576
Sorry.

480
00:43:16,676 --> 00:43:17,776
It's all right.

481
00:43:30,037 --> 00:43:31,403
May I assist you, sir?

482
00:43:32,336 --> 00:43:36,934
Oh. You scared me. No, I was
looking for Miss...

483
00:43:37,967 --> 00:43:39,566
You're Charles, aren't you?

484
00:43:40,066 --> 00:43:41,565
Are we acquainted?

485
00:43:41,998 --> 00:43:45,363
Oh, I saw you at the inquest. No,
I'm Lieutenant Columbo.

486
00:43:45,463 --> 00:43:47,296
I'm looking for Miss. Chadwick.

487
00:43:47,862 --> 00:43:49,194
You're a police officer, sir.

488
00:43:49,295 --> 00:43:52,093
Yes, I am. Yeah. Uh, is she in?

489
00:43:52,193 --> 00:43:53,459
I'm afraid not, sir.

490
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:58,890
Oh, she isn't. I see. Well, do you...

491
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:02,023
Do you know where I can
get in touch with her?

492
00:44:02,123 --> 00:44:04,721
Yes, she's at the beauty parlor.
Eugene's.

493
00:44:04,821 --> 00:44:05,588
Uh huh.

494
00:44:05,688 --> 00:44:06,921
Will that be all, sir?

495
00:44:07,021 --> 00:44:10,319
Yes, Charles. Yeah, I think so.

496
00:44:13,285 --> 00:44:14,751
Hey, this smells new.

497
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:16,083
It is, sir.

498
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:19,048
Oh. Why didn't she take it with her?

499
00:44:19,148 --> 00:44:20,581
It was just delivered.

500
00:44:20,781 --> 00:44:23,014
Oh, it was just delivered! I see.

501
00:44:23,114 --> 00:44:25,245
Well, I want to tell you, it's a
beauty.

502
00:44:25,345 --> 00:44:26,878
That's a wonderful piece of
machinery.

503
00:44:26,978 --> 00:44:27,978
Will that be all, sir?

504
00:44:28,077 --> 00:44:29,810
Yeah, Charles. That'll be all.

505
00:44:30,343 --> 00:44:33,209
I don't want you to worry about me,
Charles. I'm going to go around...

506
00:44:33,309 --> 00:44:36,340
...the side of the house here and
I'm going to conduct an experiment.

507
00:44:36,574 --> 00:44:38,773
Is it something I can
help you with, sir?

508
00:44:38,873 --> 00:44:41,971
No, Charles, it's a kind of do it
yourself thing.

509
00:44:42,272 --> 00:44:43,471
Thank you very much.

510
00:45:54,139 --> 00:45:55,806
May I help you, sir?

511
00:45:59,204 --> 00:46:02,003
Uh, well, I'm not a customer.

512
00:46:02,303 --> 00:46:05,102
No, I assumed that. You're
looking for someone?

513
00:46:05,268 --> 00:46:09,067
Yes, I was looking for a
Beth Chadwick. Miss Chadwick?

514
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:11,532
My name is Lieutenant Columbo.

515
00:46:11,632 --> 00:46:12,665
The police?

516
00:46:12,965 --> 00:46:14,197
Well, look now, it's not serious.

517
00:46:14,297 --> 00:46:16,263
I just want to talk to her
for a moment.

518
00:46:16,763 --> 00:46:19,928
Well right through that door,
Lieutenant. Cubicle four.

519
00:46:20,028 --> 00:46:20,795
Thank you.

520
00:46:21,161 --> 00:46:22,294
Ah, Lieutenant.

521
00:46:23,193 --> 00:46:24,260
Your cigar?

522
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:25,559
What about it?

523
00:46:27,292 --> 00:46:31,357
Uh, well, the fragrance is not uh...
compatible.

524
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:35,021
Oh. See that's a shame. I just
lit it.

525
00:47:07,308 --> 00:47:07,874
Oh.

526
00:47:07,974 --> 00:47:09,474
What brings you here, Lieutenant?

527
00:47:09,574 --> 00:47:13,104
Well, I stopped by the house.
I talked to Charles.

528
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:16,570
He told me where you'd be so I
thought I'd come by.

529
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:20,068
There's just one point that I
wanted to clear up.

530
00:47:21,168 --> 00:47:21,734
Do you mind?

531
00:47:21,835 --> 00:47:23,667
Does it matter? I'm a
captive audience.

532
00:47:23,767 --> 00:47:24,600
We can go, Miss.

533
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:27,065
No, no, no, that's all right. Go
ahead and finish.

534
00:47:27,232 --> 00:47:31,263
I saw your new car, by the way.
Oh, that's some automobile.

535
00:47:31,363 --> 00:47:31,863
Thank you.

536
00:47:31,963 --> 00:47:33,896
Really beautiful. Beautiful.

537
00:47:34,429 --> 00:47:37,028
I suppose you have to order those
things weeks in advance, don't you?

538
00:47:37,128 --> 00:47:37,727
Yes, that's right.

539
00:47:37,828 --> 00:47:41,493
Yeah, that's right. Boy. Real
change of pace for you, isn't it?

540
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:45,824
Well, I felt like something racy, as
they say in advertising. A new image.

541
00:47:46,124 --> 00:47:49,823
Yeah. Well y'now, I can understand
that... I'm sorry...

542
00:47:49,955 --> 00:47:55,653
...because it's a natural thing I
think, after a death in the family...

543
00:47:55,753 --> 00:47:57,419
...to want to break loose.

544
00:47:57,885 --> 00:47:59,485
That's one way of putting it.

545
00:48:00,983 --> 00:48:02,583
Gee, that's funny though.

546
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:05,515
What?

547
00:48:06,748 --> 00:48:09,014
If you had to order the car some
time ago...

548
00:48:09,114 --> 00:48:12,612
...that would mean you knew in advance
you were going to change your style.

549
00:48:13,045 --> 00:48:14,645
Finished, Miss Chadwick.

550
00:48:15,178 --> 00:48:15,744
May I see?

551
00:48:15,844 --> 00:48:16,677
Yes.

552
00:48:18,376 --> 00:48:19,476
Oh.

553
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:25,640
- Looks fabulous.
- Just amazing.

554
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,639
Miss Chadwick, you look sensational.

555
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:28,738
You really think so?

556
00:48:28,838 --> 00:48:30,538
I'd say you were a new woman.

557
00:48:31,104 --> 00:48:33,136
Oh, thank you, Lieutenant.

558
00:48:33,969 --> 00:48:37,034
Goodbye Jean, thank you.
See you next week. Bye Felicia.

559
00:48:37,468 --> 00:48:38,767
Excuse me. Sorry.

560
00:48:52,327 --> 00:48:54,227
Why Miss Chadwick, you look lovely.

561
00:48:54,327 --> 00:48:55,926
Thank you. You're very kind.

562
00:48:57,159 --> 00:48:58,858
The bill, and could I have an
appointment next week.

563
00:48:58,958 --> 00:49:00,024
Certainly.

564
00:49:00,591 --> 00:49:02,689
Well, Lieutenant, you haven't asked
me your question.

565
00:49:03,323 --> 00:49:05,189
I'll tell you what. Are you
headed home?

566
00:49:05,289 --> 00:49:06,155
Yes.

567
00:49:06,588 --> 00:49:07,554
Do you mind if I meet you there?

568
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:09,320
Because it kind of has to do with
your house.

569
00:49:09,421 --> 00:49:11,019
Is this really necessary?

570
00:49:11,453 --> 00:49:14,452
Well, in a way, it is, yes. I
promise it won't take long.

571
00:49:15,418 --> 00:49:16,950
All right. I'll meet you there.

572
00:49:17,283 --> 00:49:19,983
Lieutenant? Your cigar.

573
00:49:30,811 --> 00:49:32,277
Oh, Good afternoon, ma'am.

574
00:49:32,643 --> 00:49:33,777
Good afternoon.

575
00:49:34,076 --> 00:49:37,508
Oh, Charles, our Lieutenant
requires a stepladder.

576
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:39,940
Would you be good enough to get
one for him?

577
00:49:40,906 --> 00:49:43,972
Yes, ma'am. Another
experiment, sir?

578
00:49:44,304 --> 00:49:48,437
Uh, well, I guess you could call it
that, yeah.

579
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:51,035
Experiment, Lieutenant?

580
00:49:51,568 --> 00:49:55,033
Uh huh. Like I said, I was out here
earlier.

581
00:49:55,134 --> 00:49:56,700
Hey, why don't I show it to you?

582
00:50:00,165 --> 00:50:04,462
Now, you figured that your brother
had to walk around...

583
00:50:04,562 --> 00:50:06,962
...the side of the house like this.
Is that right?

584
00:50:07,228 --> 00:50:09,794
I figure it. And so did the
coroner's jury.

585
00:50:09,894 --> 00:50:14,125
Right. Now you see you had to walk
on grass.

586
00:50:18,323 --> 00:50:20,056
Is there some point to this?

587
00:50:20,156 --> 00:50:20,956
Yes, ma'am, there is.

588
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:25,220
You see, now this grass is kind of
dry because the sun's been out.

589
00:50:26,786 --> 00:50:28,352
Uh, well, today's Thursday.

590
00:50:29,885 --> 00:50:35,316
And the gardener cuts the grass on
Thursday. Excuse me a minute.

591
00:50:38,647 --> 00:50:41,613
You see? Grass.

592
00:50:42,912 --> 00:50:44,678
Yes. Well, that's only natural.

593
00:50:44,778 --> 00:50:48,976
It certainly is. But you know there
was no grass on your brother's shoe?

594
00:50:51,075 --> 00:50:52,808
I'm afraid I don't quite understand.

595
00:50:52,974 --> 00:50:57,040
Your brother was shot a week ago.
On Thursday. And I looked at the

596
00:50:57,139 --> 00:50:59,172
...photographs of the body, I even had
them blown up...

597
00:50:59,271 --> 00:51:02,770
...and for the life of me, I just
couldn't see any grass...

598
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:06,602
...on the soles of his shoe. And I
couldn't figure that out. Why?

599
00:51:06,736 --> 00:51:08,068
It was freshly cut...

600
00:51:08,168 --> 00:51:11,600
...and it was sticky because it was
at night and there was dew.

601
00:51:15,032 --> 00:51:19,297
Y'now that's very good. He must've
had particles of grass on his shoes.

602
00:51:20,062 --> 00:51:22,662
But they were probably brushed off
on the carpet.

603
00:51:23,462 --> 00:51:25,693
And unfortunately the room's been
cleaned.

604
00:51:26,493 --> 00:51:28,026
Yeah, I know.

605
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:31,358
Well, unless there's something else?

606
00:51:32,124 --> 00:51:33,557
Just one more thing.

607
00:51:34,323 --> 00:51:36,656
I guess Charles has the stepladder
by now, huh?

608
00:51:37,155 --> 00:51:37,855
I would think.

609
00:51:37,955 --> 00:51:38,688
Yeah.

610
00:51:43,618 --> 00:51:49,017
The other morning when I was over
here, I noticed these potted plants.

611
00:51:49,249 --> 00:51:50,483
How observant.

612
00:51:50,615 --> 00:51:52,315
And they're very pretty, you know.

613
00:51:52,415 --> 00:51:55,447
But I got to thinking, I says to
myself, y'now sometimes people they...

614
00:51:55,547 --> 00:52:00,045
...keep a spare key outside, just in
case they forget their own key.

615
00:52:00,944 --> 00:52:04,177
Uh, do you... do you see this?

616
00:52:04,543 --> 00:52:05,376
What?

617
00:52:06,476 --> 00:52:08,108
This imprint here.

618
00:52:08,908 --> 00:52:10,274
Yes. What about it?

619
00:52:10,673 --> 00:52:12,972
Well that's like a fossil or
something.

620
00:52:13,073 --> 00:52:17,870
You see, a spare key must've been
hidden in there for a long time.

621
00:52:18,537 --> 00:52:20,836
You see, that's been rained on and
everything.

622
00:52:23,635 --> 00:52:24,967
There was a spare key.

623
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:26,400
Oh?

624
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,632
I put it there myself when the alarm
system was installed.

625
00:52:30,032 --> 00:52:31,764
Bryce didn't know about it.

626
00:52:31,864 --> 00:52:34,130
I also removed it from there myself
recently...

627
00:52:34,229 --> 00:52:35,829
...because I had second thoughts.

628
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:38,262
What do you mean by second thoughts?

629
00:52:38,528 --> 00:52:41,660
Well, if a burglar were in fact on
the premises, he might find the key...

630
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,759
...and then what good would the
alarm system be?

631
00:52:43,859 --> 00:52:45,125
Good point.

632
00:52:47,258 --> 00:52:49,690
Yes, hey yeah.

633
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:52,322
I was right, wasn't I? Because you
found it.

634
00:52:53,555 --> 00:52:54,954
Yeah, I guess I did.

635
00:52:55,787 --> 00:52:56,420
All right, Lieutenant.

636
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,619
I think you've finally overstayed
your welcome.

637
00:52:59,186 --> 00:53:02,051
The official verdict is death by
accidental means...

638
00:53:02,151 --> 00:53:03,850
...and that should satisfy you.

639
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:05,983
Look ma'am, I don't mean any
offense.

640
00:53:06,083 --> 00:53:08,848
I'm just trying to tie up loose
ends.

641
00:53:08,947 --> 00:53:11,647
You see, I'm compulsive that way,
it's just, well...

642
00:53:11,746 --> 00:53:14,112
...that's what my wife says
about it, just...

643
00:53:14,845 --> 00:53:16,111
Are you really?

644
00:53:17,844 --> 00:53:22,676
No, I mean all I meant by that was
that, well you see, if there was...

645
00:53:22,776 --> 00:53:27,440
...a key there, and if Bryce knew
about it, well, then of course...

646
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:30,438
...he would use the key to let himself
in through the front door.

647
00:53:30,538 --> 00:53:33,404
But I told the truth the night it
happened.

648
00:53:33,704 --> 00:53:36,002
And I told the truth at the inquest.

649
00:53:36,702 --> 00:53:40,467
So whatever your little compulsions
may be...

650
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:43,632
I'm afraid I must insist you
leave me alone.

651
00:53:51,696 --> 00:53:55,627
Oh, goodbye.

652
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,887
I'll take it all.

653
00:54:13,719 --> 00:54:14,786
Well, is that it?

654
00:54:14,885 --> 00:54:16,218
No, I haven't finished.

655
00:54:17,118 --> 00:54:18,218
You're not bored, are you?

656
00:54:18,317 --> 00:54:20,583
No, no... I'm having a wonderful time.

657
00:54:20,683 --> 00:54:21,782
Is there something young and bright?

658
00:54:21,882 --> 00:54:23,448
Why don't you try this one?

659
00:54:23,548 --> 00:54:26,747
Oh, that's marvelous. I want to
try that on. Excuse us.

660
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,512
Don't forget to get my hat over by
the black bag...

661
00:54:29,612 --> 00:54:31,145
...could you bring it with me?

662
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:35,343
Could you get the zipper? Peter!

663
00:54:35,577 --> 00:54:36,110
Yes?

664
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:38,508
Everybody set for this afternoon's
meeting?

665
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:40,774
Uh, yes, but I was wondering, Beth.

666
00:54:40,874 --> 00:54:41,307
Huh?

667
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:44,339
Uh, don't you think it's a little
premature?

668
00:54:44,439 --> 00:54:46,605
Perhaps another week for things
to ease up.

669
00:54:46,704 --> 00:54:48,903
No. It must be today.

670
00:54:50,536 --> 00:54:51,869
All right. It's up to you.

671
00:54:59,733 --> 00:55:01,898
Well? What do you think?

672
00:55:03,098 --> 00:55:04,063
Interesting.

673
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:06,129
What does that mean?

674
00:55:07,662 --> 00:55:10,628
It's wild. Uh, a little out of your
style though, isn't it?

675
00:55:11,561 --> 00:55:12,927
No, I don't think it is.

676
00:55:14,759 --> 00:55:16,359
Well, you asked.

677
00:55:17,424 --> 00:55:18,790
It was a courtesy.

678
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:23,389
I'm perfectly capable of making
my own decisions.

679
00:55:25,621 --> 00:55:29,253
Oh, what is that silver dress over
there on the rail?

680
00:55:29,752 --> 00:55:31,285
This one! This matches it!

681
00:55:31,385 --> 00:55:32,551
Uh, Beth?

682
00:55:32,651 --> 00:55:35,150
Why don't you finish your wardrobe?
I'm going back to the office.

683
00:55:35,251 --> 00:55:37,582
No, no, I want you to wait till I'm
ready to go?

684
00:55:37,682 --> 00:55:39,249
Do you have trousers that go with
the red top?

685
00:55:39,349 --> 00:55:45,479
Beth. I'm not sure what's gotten
into you, but I'm not sure I like it.

686
00:55:45,945 --> 00:55:48,877
I'll see you. If you need me, I'll
be back at the office.

687
00:55:50,876 --> 00:55:52,376
Did you want to try this on?

688
00:55:52,476 --> 00:55:55,708
Yes. This one and that blue dress
over there, please.

689
00:56:26,027 --> 00:56:27,493
Ladies and gentlemen...

690
00:56:30,992 --> 00:56:32,725
...will you please take your seats.

691
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:47,785
Well now, we've all been through a
period of anxiety and indecision...

692
00:56:47,885 --> 00:56:49,550
...since my brother's death...

693
00:56:50,151 --> 00:56:53,782
...but in a corporate sense we must
maintain our continuity.

694
00:56:54,682 --> 00:56:58,314
As you all well know, this
is a family owned firm.

695
00:56:58,613 --> 00:57:01,845
Therefore, as of today, I am
assuming the presidency.

696
00:57:02,045 --> 00:57:04,110
As my first order of business...

697
00:57:05,077 --> 00:57:09,242
I would like to announce the
elevation of Mr. Peter Hamilton...

698
00:57:09,475 --> 00:57:12,507
...to executive vice-president in
charge of accounts.

699
00:57:14,606 --> 00:57:18,971
As to philosophy, my brother was a
traditionalist.

700
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:22,403
I want to break new ground.

701
00:57:23,535 --> 00:57:25,435
Would you pass these along, please.

702
00:57:26,101 --> 00:57:30,632
I want to streamline. We're going to
cut down marginal accounts...

703
00:57:30,732 --> 00:57:33,531
...and we're going to start promoting
ourselves for a change.

704
00:57:34,198 --> 00:57:37,163
It seems to me we've been selling
everything but our own product.

705
00:57:37,263 --> 00:57:39,595
Beth, forgive me, but that
is our job.

706
00:57:39,962 --> 00:57:43,160
Forgive me, but it's not. Our job
is to grow.

707
00:57:43,561 --> 00:57:46,525
Now when was the last time this
agency took on a new account?

708
00:57:46,625 --> 00:57:48,292
We have all we can handle.

709
00:57:48,392 --> 00:57:48,925
Nonsense!

710
00:57:49,025 --> 00:57:51,191
Now look, Beth, I don't want to be
difficult, but I... I...

711
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:53,522
Fred, I don't mean to interrupt you...

712
00:57:53,722 --> 00:57:56,454
...but this is really not the time for
negative thinking.

713
00:57:56,555 --> 00:57:58,220
Now, if you disagree with my
approach...

714
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:01,553
...you're perfectly free to sever
your relationship with the firm.

715
00:58:02,618 --> 00:58:07,150
No, Beth, I feel I can accommodate
myself to your way of thinking.

716
00:58:08,183 --> 00:58:09,715
Yes, I'm sure you can.

717
00:58:12,214 --> 00:58:13,480
Any questions?

718
00:58:19,311 --> 00:58:20,777
Very well. We'll adjourn.

719
00:58:22,343 --> 00:58:25,775
Oh. One more thing. A happy and
personal note.

720
00:58:25,875 --> 00:58:30,273
I'd like to announce my engagement
to Mr. Hamilton. Thank you.

721
00:58:33,272 --> 00:58:34,871
Are those letters for me to sign?

722
00:58:39,169 --> 00:58:40,302
Yeah, right.

723
00:58:41,635 --> 00:58:42,734
Congratulations.

724
00:58:43,367 --> 00:58:44,367
Thank you.

725
00:59:02,858 --> 00:59:09,122
You must be out of your mind. What
qualifies you to run this company?

726
00:59:09,622 --> 00:59:11,588
I had a very good teacher, my
brother.

727
00:59:12,021 --> 00:59:15,620
I've been studying his reports for
years and asking questions.

728
00:59:16,453 --> 00:59:18,152
Thank you. We'll finish later.

729
00:59:19,317 --> 00:59:21,351
He may not have known it, but he was
grooming me.

730
00:59:22,617 --> 00:59:26,515
Well, don't forget. I am the
majority stockholder.

731
00:59:26,981 --> 00:59:29,180
I will not relinquish control.

732
00:59:30,646 --> 00:59:31,912
Don't be naive, Mother.

733
00:59:32,012 --> 00:59:34,844
Who else can take over and still
keep it in the family?

734
00:59:35,977 --> 00:59:38,042
Besides, I'm prepared to go to
court if necessary.

735
00:59:38,143 --> 00:59:41,908
And you know what that means,
publicity, interviews, scandal.

736
00:59:43,508 --> 00:59:46,572
I can't believe you're talking to
me like this.

737
00:59:47,372 --> 00:59:49,238
Are you prepared to take over the
company?

738
00:59:49,538 --> 00:59:51,871
You're getting old, Mother, or
hadn't you noticed?

739
00:59:54,802 --> 00:59:55,735
Come in.

740
00:59:59,733 --> 01:00:00,932
Am I interrupting something?

741
01:00:01,333 --> 01:00:02,799
What do you want, Lieutenant?

742
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:04,531
Well, I just thought that...

743
01:00:05,064 --> 01:00:07,996
Why, hello there fella, how
you doin'?

744
01:00:09,163 --> 01:00:12,760
I got a treat for you. I got a
little something for him.

745
01:00:13,361 --> 01:00:14,360
Here you are.

746
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:17,092
Y'now I've been carrying these
things around with me all week.

747
01:00:17,259 --> 01:00:21,890
Come here, boy. Come on. Take one
of these. Look at that. C'mon.

748
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:25,156
Oh, easy. Easy.

749
01:00:26,522 --> 01:00:28,887
I think we have a personality
conflict.

750
01:00:28,987 --> 01:00:31,486
Do you need me for anything,
Lieutenant? Come here.

751
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:34,551
Uh, no ma'am. No, I don't think so.

752
01:00:34,685 --> 01:00:36,417
Then I'll be leaving.

753
01:00:36,917 --> 01:00:37,716
Mother?

754
01:00:40,349 --> 01:00:41,815
We'll go into this later.

755
01:00:42,781 --> 01:00:44,047
As you wish.

756
01:00:50,744 --> 01:00:52,310
I'll leave the two of you alone.

757
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:53,943
No, that's all right Peter.

758
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:56,242
The Lieutenant is going to be
very brief.

759
01:00:58,474 --> 01:00:59,841
Well Columbo, what is it now?

760
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:03,939
We've talked about keys and grass
and newspapers. Oh, thank you.

761
01:01:05,804 --> 01:01:08,670
Well you know how one thing leads to
another. Now when I was... thank you...

762
01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:10,469
When I was over at your house there
the other day...

763
01:01:10,569 --> 01:01:12,801
...and I was climbing up and down that
ladder...

764
01:01:13,067 --> 01:01:16,066
...I tell you, I had a thought,
something else occurred to me...

765
01:01:17,033 --> 01:01:18,698
...that's been keeping me awake
at night.

766
01:01:18,798 --> 01:01:20,298
Oh. What might that be?

767
01:01:20,398 --> 01:01:24,229
Well, I was wondering about that
burned out bulb...

768
01:01:24,995 --> 01:01:25,962
...in front of your house.

769
01:01:26,062 --> 01:01:29,327
And I went over there this morning
to take a look at it. And...

770
01:01:29,993 --> 01:01:31,359
You brought it with you!

771
01:01:31,926 --> 01:01:33,891
Oh yeah. I didn't think you'd mind.

772
01:01:33,991 --> 01:01:35,092
No.

773
01:01:36,657 --> 01:01:39,422
This is a hundred watt bulb.
Hundred watt?

774
01:01:40,756 --> 01:01:46,386
Got a life 750-800 hours. Now, if
your house is anything like...

775
01:01:46,486 --> 01:01:50,118
...my house then you'll burn the
outside light 8-10 hours a day.

776
01:01:50,318 --> 01:01:54,216
So that means it would last two, two
and a half months. Is that right?

777
01:01:55,348 --> 01:01:57,548
I'll concede to your knowledge.
I don't know.

778
01:01:58,115 --> 01:01:59,247
Thank you very much.

779
01:01:59,547 --> 01:02:02,046
Uh, now this is what I got to
thinking.

780
01:02:03,778 --> 01:02:06,011
I hate to change bulbs outside my
house...

781
01:02:06,111 --> 01:02:09,210
...because no matter how tight I get
that up in the lamp...

782
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:12,375
...you see, they attract a lot of dirt
and goop and they're full of

783
01:02:12,475 --> 01:02:15,441
...dead bugs and I just don't even
like to go up there and touch them.

784
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:16,939
Would you get to the point?

785
01:02:18,405 --> 01:02:22,870
Uh, why is that bulb dirt and dust
free?

786
01:02:23,203 --> 01:02:25,103
That bulb is clean as a whistle.

787
01:02:26,469 --> 01:02:29,068
Now I think that's kind of
strange, don't you?

788
01:02:29,734 --> 01:02:32,965
Hanging there long enough
to burn out,

789
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:35,697
but not hanging there long enough
to get dirty.

790
01:02:37,064 --> 01:02:38,897
We're a fastidious family.

791
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:42,362
If the bulb is clean it's because
servants cleaned it.

792
01:02:45,127 --> 01:02:47,026
They cleaned a burned out bulb?

793
01:02:47,959 --> 01:02:50,758
They work in the daytime. So how
would they know?

794
01:02:51,757 --> 01:02:53,856
All right Lieutenant, I think
that'll be enough.

795
01:02:54,656 --> 01:02:55,189
I beg your pardon?

796
01:02:55,289 --> 01:02:57,321
I want you to listen to this very
carefully.

797
01:02:57,688 --> 01:02:59,521
I don't ever want to see you again.

798
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:03,253
You'll be refused admittance to my
house and to this office.

799
01:03:03,352 --> 01:03:04,619
I have a great deal of work to do...

800
01:03:04,718 --> 01:03:07,284
...and I no longer can indulge
your suspicions.

801
01:03:07,483 --> 01:03:10,482
If you think you have a case against
me, go to the District Attorney.

802
01:03:10,948 --> 01:03:12,182
Is that clear?

803
01:03:13,015 --> 01:03:15,480
Yes. That's very clear.

804
01:03:25,209 --> 01:03:28,574
I'm warning you. No more questions.

805
01:03:28,941 --> 01:03:30,840
I wasn't going to ask a
question, ma'am.

806
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,006
I just wanted to return your bulb.

807
01:03:49,365 --> 01:03:52,164
What can we do about him?

808
01:03:53,164 --> 01:03:54,929
Beth, take it easy. Calm down.

809
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:59,161
Oh, stop saying calm down. You're
a lawyer, do something!

810
01:03:59,261 --> 01:04:02,227
I mean we can institute some kind of
proceedings against him.

811
01:04:02,326 --> 01:04:04,725
There must be somebody in the city
government who can do something!

812
01:04:04,825 --> 01:04:06,724
Calm down. Take it easy.

813
01:04:06,824 --> 01:04:08,857
Well is that your professional
advice?

814
01:04:09,124 --> 01:04:12,322
Beth. What in the world has gotten
into you?

815
01:04:12,455 --> 01:04:14,121
We never argued like this before.

816
01:04:20,485 --> 01:04:21,817
We're not arguing.

817
01:04:26,483 --> 01:04:28,115
Something's wrong. What is it?

818
01:04:28,348 --> 01:04:29,115
All right, there is.

819
01:04:29,215 --> 01:04:33,579
Number one: this business of
arbitrarily promoting me.

820
01:04:33,846 --> 01:04:37,044
To say the least it smacks of high
level nepotism. It's...

821
01:04:38,844 --> 01:04:41,442
And I assume there's a number two.

822
01:04:41,709 --> 01:04:42,842
Yes, there is.

823
01:04:42,942 --> 01:04:45,607
You announced our engagement without
even letting me know.

824
01:04:45,741 --> 01:04:47,140
I thought it would please you!

825
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:48,172
It did please me.

826
01:04:48,272 --> 01:04:50,871
But don't you think you could've
consulted with me?

827
01:04:51,472 --> 01:04:53,837
I was just as surprised to hear it
as everybody else.

828
01:04:57,435 --> 01:04:59,267
Well, I did it for you.

829
01:05:01,134 --> 01:05:03,200
I mean, we are going to
get married, aren't we?

830
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:04,499
That's not the point.

831
01:05:05,531 --> 01:05:07,897
I would have liked to have
had a hand in the decision.

832
01:05:08,797 --> 01:05:10,130
Now it's not like you to act
this way.

833
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:11,962
This is way out of character
for you.

834
01:05:13,562 --> 01:05:14,427
Well, if I've changed...

835
01:05:14,527 --> 01:05:17,226
...it's because I thought you'd
like a more exciting woman.

836
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:21,358
A change, yes, but a complete
metamorphosis?

837
01:05:22,291 --> 01:05:24,490
I'm not sure Beth you're
the same person.

838
01:05:27,922 --> 01:05:29,088
Maybe I'm not.

839
01:05:37,918 --> 01:05:39,351
Maybe Bryce was right.

840
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:40,583
About what?

841
01:05:42,349 --> 01:05:45,014
About your being the wrong kind
of man for me.

842
01:06:03,606 --> 01:06:05,006
What's that, the third?

843
01:06:05,305 --> 01:06:06,671
I get paid not to count.

844
01:06:06,771 --> 01:06:08,704
Just keep 'em coming, that's all.

845
01:06:24,596 --> 01:06:28,495
Well, I didn't think you people
were supposed to drink on duty.

846
01:06:28,595 --> 01:06:29,995
Oh, Mr. Hamilton.

847
01:06:30,827 --> 01:06:34,826
Drink? Oh no, that's coffee.
No, I don't drink.

848
01:06:35,959 --> 01:06:38,124
No, it's been a very long day.

849
01:06:39,923 --> 01:06:41,656
I can see it's been a long day
for you too.

850
01:06:41,756 --> 01:06:43,522
Oh, it shows huh?

851
01:06:44,821 --> 01:06:47,620
Y'now, it's quite a coincidence...

852
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:50,053
...you and I both meeting in the same
place like this.

853
01:06:50,152 --> 01:06:52,217
Yes, it is, isn't it? Yeah.

854
01:06:55,383 --> 01:06:56,382
What are you reading?

855
01:06:57,149 --> 01:07:01,280
Oh this? This is a transcript of
the inquest.

856
01:07:02,347 --> 01:07:05,346
Listen, congratulations. I
understand you're engaged.

857
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,644
Not necessarily.

858
01:07:07,878 --> 01:07:09,377
Oh really? What happened?

859
01:07:09,710 --> 01:07:12,442
Let's get back to this. See I want
to ask you something.

860
01:07:13,509 --> 01:07:15,974
Lieutenant, why are you hounding
Beth?

861
01:07:16,308 --> 01:07:21,939
Hounding? Who me? Oh no, I'm not
hounding anybody. Oh no. No.

862
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:24,771
No, what I'm trying to do is get
to the bottom of this thing.

863
01:07:26,236 --> 01:07:32,334
Y'now Lieutenant, I like you. I
really do. But you are devious.

864
01:07:32,433 --> 01:07:33,000
Devious?

865
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:35,199
Your job was finished with the
coroner's verdict.

866
01:07:35,299 --> 01:07:38,197
But you're still hanging around.
You're still asking questions.

867
01:07:38,298 --> 01:07:41,496
You even managed to bump
into me here.

868
01:07:42,496 --> 01:07:46,161
Now, Lieutenant. You don't really
think that...

869
01:07:46,261 --> 01:07:49,226
...Beth killed her brother in cold
blood now, do you?

870
01:07:49,559 --> 01:07:54,124
Well, as a matter of fact, I do.

871
01:08:04,287 --> 01:08:08,018
Mr. Hamilton, you asked me what I
thought. Now I'm going to tell you.

872
01:08:09,084 --> 01:08:12,849
I think she set it up, I think it
was deliberate...

873
01:08:13,016 --> 01:08:14,649
...and I think you can help me
prove it.

874
01:08:14,748 --> 01:08:18,380
Now, excuse me. You're sure that
that's coffee you're drinking?

875
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:20,113
Because you're not making any sense.

876
01:08:20,213 --> 01:08:23,944
I was there. And I know Beth didn't
kill anybody. It was an accident.

877
01:08:24,610 --> 01:08:26,510
Can I tell you about my wife?

878
01:08:26,776 --> 01:08:30,441
Y'now my wife, she's got a proverb
for every situation.

879
01:08:30,541 --> 01:08:33,840
You know with her, a rolling stone
gathers no moss...

880
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:35,473
you gotta look before you leap...

881
01:08:35,572 --> 01:08:37,505
I'm sure that your wife is a very
nice woman.

882
01:08:37,704 --> 01:08:39,671
But what has that got
to do with the case?

883
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:43,202
To be honest, she solved it for me.

884
01:08:44,035 --> 01:08:46,234
We were having an argument last
night, she says to me...

885
01:08:46,368 --> 01:08:51,432
"You're putting the cart before the
horse", and I said, "Right."

886
01:08:52,165 --> 01:08:57,762
In this case, the horse is before
the cart. And I had the answer.

887
01:08:58,695 --> 01:08:59,861
And what was that?

888
01:09:00,128 --> 01:09:03,326
In the transcript you weren't very
specific.

889
01:09:03,593 --> 01:09:05,559
I know. I just read every word
of it.

890
01:09:05,659 --> 01:09:08,258
But I think on the night of the
murder you said something.

891
01:09:08,625 --> 01:09:12,456
If you can remember that, and you
tell me you got a terrific memory...

892
01:09:13,189 --> 01:09:17,320
...then you'll know, you'll know for
sure whether or not Beth Chadwick...

893
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:18,686
murdered her brother.

894
01:09:25,484 --> 01:09:29,582
All right. And what do I remember?

895
01:09:57,070 --> 01:09:58,402
Who is it? Who's there?

896
01:10:01,034 --> 01:10:02,168
Who's there?

897
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:22,226
Hello operator? Get me the police.

898
01:10:28,489 --> 01:10:29,589
Operator?

899
01:10:30,422 --> 01:10:32,588
Oh operator, I'm sorry. Forget it.

900
01:10:36,985 --> 01:10:38,518
Lieutenant Columbo?

901
01:10:40,084 --> 01:10:41,116
Is that you?

902
01:10:44,149 --> 01:10:45,415
Come on, Lieutenant.

903
01:10:47,781 --> 01:10:49,147
Come in and have a drink.

904
01:10:54,644 --> 01:10:56,277
Lieutenant Columbo?

905
01:11:16,601 --> 01:11:18,967
This is the way your brother came in
that night, isn't it?

906
01:11:21,833 --> 01:11:22,832
How did you get in?

907
01:11:22,932 --> 01:11:25,298
Same way your brother did. With a
spare key.

908
01:11:25,564 --> 01:11:30,162
One of my men located your locksmith.
He was very cooperative.

909
01:11:32,261 --> 01:11:34,927
What do you expect to prove by this
bit of nonsense?

910
01:11:35,027 --> 01:11:36,725
Oh, I don't want to prove
anything, ma'am.

911
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:38,292
I came to arrest you.

912
01:11:39,457 --> 01:11:40,257
Arrest me?

913
01:11:40,357 --> 01:11:41,456
Yes, ma'am.

914
01:11:43,056 --> 01:11:44,355
For the murder of your brother.

915
01:11:44,455 --> 01:11:44,922
Oh.

916
01:11:45,022 --> 01:11:47,154
And I did have a reason for coming
in this way.

917
01:11:47,854 --> 01:11:49,753
I wanted to see the look
on your face.

918
01:11:51,053 --> 01:11:55,218
Well, I'll consider myself
under arrest.

919
01:11:56,684 --> 01:11:59,582
And now I want to see the look on
your face when I call my lawyer.

920
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:01,115
You know what's ironic?

921
01:12:02,247 --> 01:12:04,114
I knew it wasn't an accident the
first night.

922
01:12:04,214 --> 01:12:06,180
I knew it as soon as I saw that
newspaper.

923
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,112
But I didn't have any proof.

924
01:12:08,312 --> 01:12:10,144
I had to wait for the proof.

925
01:12:11,244 --> 01:12:13,910
I had to wait for your fiance to
give it to me.

926
01:12:14,476 --> 01:12:15,109
From Peter?

927
01:12:15,209 --> 01:12:17,908
Yes, ma'am. Although I don't think
he meant to.

928
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:21,573
You see, according to your story,
you were asleep at night...

929
01:12:21,672 --> 01:12:24,005
the alarm woke you up, you reached
for a gun...

930
01:12:24,105 --> 01:12:26,437
...and you shot what you thought
was a burglar.

931
01:12:27,470 --> 01:12:29,203
Which is exactly what happened.

932
01:12:29,302 --> 01:12:33,467
Couldn't be. Because Mr. Hamilton,
who was driving up outside...

933
01:12:33,567 --> 01:12:37,432
...at the time, he heard both the
shots and alarm.

934
01:12:37,799 --> 01:12:40,265
Of course he did. What difference
does that make?

935
01:12:40,365 --> 01:12:42,230
Oh, big difference.

936
01:12:42,963 --> 01:12:46,961
He heard the shots first, then the
alarm.

937
01:12:47,961 --> 01:12:50,293
That's the cart before the horse.

938
01:12:50,826 --> 01:12:54,957
I mean, how could the alarm wake you
if the shots came first?

939
01:12:56,024 --> 01:13:00,322
You see, what really happened was
your brother came walking in here...

940
01:13:00,722 --> 01:13:04,254
...just the way I did tonight, you
shot him...

941
01:13:04,887 --> 01:13:08,285
...and then you set the alarm a few
seconds later.

942
01:13:14,749 --> 01:13:15,682
Peter is mistaken.

943
01:13:15,782 --> 01:13:19,313
No. He's a very good lawyer and he
prides himself on his memory.

944
01:13:19,814 --> 01:13:21,113
And he won't like it...

945
01:13:21,546 --> 01:13:24,311
...but he'll testify against you in
court if he has to.

946
01:13:24,911 --> 01:13:28,110
Along with the other holes in your
story, I think they'll convict you.

947
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:36,406
No, really, you don't
want to do that.

948
01:13:37,272 --> 01:13:39,571
Policemen outside, what would be
the point?

949
01:13:46,269 --> 01:13:48,301
Besides, you're too classy a woman.

950
01:13:53,899 --> 01:13:55,364
Now would you get dressed, ma'am?

951
01:13:57,331 --> 01:13:58,963
Take all the time you need.
