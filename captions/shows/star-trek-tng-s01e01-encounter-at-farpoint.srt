1
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:22,364
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

2
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:26,785
<i>These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.</i>

3
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:32,287
<i>to explore strange new worlds,</i>

4
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:36,996
<i>to seek out new life
and new civilizations,</i>

5
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:41,877
<i>to boldly go where no one
has gone before.</i>

6
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:33,575
<i>Captain's log, stardate 41153.7.</i>

7
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:36,498
<i>Our destination is planet Deneb IV,</i>

8
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:41,704
<i>beyond which lies the great
unexplored mass of the galaxy.</i>

9
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,039
As you ordered, sir.

10
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,213
<i>My orders are to examine Farpoint,</i>

11
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:51,138
<i>a starbase built there
by the inhabitants of that world.</i>

12
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:54,638
<i>Meanwhile, I'm becoming better
acquainted with my new command,</i>

13
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,141
<i>this Galaxy-class USS Enterprise.</i>

14
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:05,565
<i>I am still somewhat in awe
of its size and complexity.</i>

15
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,864
<i>As for my crew,
we are short in several key positions,</i>

16
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:12,443
<i>most notably, a first officer.</i>

17
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,494
<i>But I am informed
that a highly experienced man,</i>

18
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:18,450
<i>one Commander William Riker,
will be waiting to join the ship</i>

19
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,830
<i>at our Deneb IV destination.</i>

20
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:25,005
You will agree, Data,
that Starfleet's orders are difficult.

21
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,627
Difficult?

22
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:29,381
Simply solve the mystery
of Farpoint Station.

23
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,427
As simple as that.

24
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:35,804
Farpoint Station.
Even the name sounds mysterious.

25
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,054
It's hardly simple, Data,

26
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,808
to negotiate a friendly agreement
for Starfleet to use the base

27
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,888
while, at the same time, snoop around

28
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,600
finding out how and why
the life-form there built it.

29
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:49,154
Inquiry. The word "snoop"?

30
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,402
Data, how can you be programmed

31
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,700
as a virtual encyclopedia
of human information

32
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,119
without knowing a simple word
like snoop?

33
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:01,871
A kind of human behavior
I was not designed to emulate.

34
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:09,000
It means, uh, to spy, to sneak.

35
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,801
Ah, to seek covertly, to go stealthily,

36
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,130
- to slink, slither...
- Exactly, yes.

37
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,556
- ...glide, creep, skulk, pussyfoot, gum...
- Yes.

38
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:17,974
- ...shoe.
- Captain.

39
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,345
I'm sensing a...

40
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,232
A powerful mind.

41
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,606
Something strange
on this detector circuit.

42
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,911
It registers as solid, captain.

43
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:50,249
Or an incredibly powerful forcefield. If
we collide with either, it could be very--

44
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,427
Shut off that damn noise!
Go to yellow alert.

45
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,642
Shields and deflectors up, sir.

46
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,742
Reverse power, full stop.

47
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,949
Controls to full stop, sir.

48
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,303
Now reading full stop, sir.

49
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:54,026
Thou art notified that thy kind hath
infiltrated the galaxy too far already.

50
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:57,904
Thou art directed to return
to thine own solar system immediately.

51
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,321
That's quite a directive.

52
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,824
Would you mind identifying
what you are?

53
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,080
We call ourselves the Q.

54
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,959
Or thou mayst call me that.

55
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,668
It's all much the same thing.

56
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,305
I present myself to thee
as a fellow ship captain

57
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,633
that thou mayst better understand me.

58
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,969
Go back whence thou camest.

59
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,223
Stay where thou art.

60
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:39,574
- Data, call medics.
- He's frozen.

61
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,205
He would not have injured you. Do
you recognize this? The stun setting?

62
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,245
Knowing humans as thou dost,
captain,

63
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,703
wouldst thou be captured helpless
by them?

64
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:56,133
Now, go back
or thou shalt most certainly die.

65
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,315
<i>Captain's log, supplementary.</i>

66
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,985
<i>The frozen form of Lieutenant Torres
has been rushed to Sickbay.</i>

67
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:19,907
<i>The question now
is the incredible power of the Q being.</i>

68
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,576
<i>Do we dare oppose it?</i>

69
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:27,532
Captain,
thy little centuries go by so rapidly.

70
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:31,619
Perhaps thou
will better understand this.

71
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,383
Actually,
the issue at stake is patriotism.

72
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,086
You must return to your world
and put an end to the commies.

73
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,092
All it takes are a few good men.

74
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:47,096
What?
That nonsense is centuries behind us.

75
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,600
But you can't deny that you're still
a dangerous, savage, child race.

76
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,681
Most certainly I deny it.

77
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:57,395
I agree we still were when humans
wore costumes like that,

78
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,070
400 years ago.

79
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,988
At which time you slaughtered millions

80
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,784
in silly arguments about how to divide
the resources of your little world.

81
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,111
And 400 years before that,

82
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,994
you were murdering each other
in quarrels over tribal god images.

83
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,951
Since then, there are no indications
that humans will ever change.

84
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,038
But even when we wore costumes
like that,

85
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,499
we'd already started
to make rapid progress.

86
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:21,677
Oh, yeah? You wanna review
your rapid progress?

87
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,471
Rapid progress.

88
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:33,055
To where humans learned
to control their military with drugs.

89
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:37,484
Sir, Sickbay reports
Lieutenant Torres' condition is better.

90
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:41,609
Oh, concern for one's fellow comrade.

91
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,030
How touching.

92
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:46,235
And now a personal request, sir.
Permission to clean up the Bridge.

93
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,615
Lieutenant Worf is right, sir.

94
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,821
As security chief,
I can't just stand here and let--

95
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,577
Yes you can, Lieutenant Yar.

96
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,953
Oh, better.

97
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,415
And later,
on finally reaching deep space,

98
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,421
humans, of course,
found enemies to fight out there too.

99
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,502
And to broaden those struggles,

100
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,555
you again found allies
for still more murdering.

101
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:11,476
The same old story, all over again.

102
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:15,226
No. The same old story
is the one we're meeting now.

103
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:20,277
Self-righteous life-forms who are eager
not to learn, but to prosecute.

104
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:23,356
To judge anything they don't
understand or can't tolerate.

105
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,612
What an interesting idea,
prosecute and judge.

106
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,695
Suppose it turns out we understand
you humans only too well?

107
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,782
We've no fear of what the true facts
about us will reveal.

108
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,960
Facts about you?
Splendid. Splendid, captain.

109
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,209
You're a veritable fountain
of good ideas.

110
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,915
There are preparations to make.

111
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:46,720
But when we next meet, captain,
we'll proceed exactly as you suggest.

112
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,809
Sir, respectfully submit,
our only choice is to fight.

113
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,480
Fight or try to escape.

114
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,309
Sense anything, commander?

115
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:05,273
Its mind is much too powerful.
Recommend we avoid contact.

116
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,870
From this point, no station aboard,
repeat, no station for any reason,

117
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,243
will make use of transmitted signals
or intercom.

118
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,868
We'll try and take them by surprise.

119
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,875
Let's see
what this Galaxy-class starship can do.

120
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:24,629
Lieutenant, inform engine room
to prepare for maximum acceleration.

121
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,210
- Aye, sir.
- Record search, Data.

122
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:30,217
Results of detaching saucer section
at high-warp velocity.

123
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,595
Inadvisable at any warp speed, sir.

124
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,972
Search theoretical.

125
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,561
It is possible.
But absolutely no margin for error.

126
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,652
Using printout only, notify all decks
to prepare for maximum acceleration.

127
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:47,322
"Maximum," you're entitled to know,

128
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:50,651
means that we'll be pushing
our engines well beyond safety limits.

129
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:54,159
Our hope is to surprise
whatever that is out there.

130
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,114
Try and outrun it.

131
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,701
Our only other option

132
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:04,631
is to tuck tail between our legs
and return to Earth as they demand.

133
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:09,507
The centrifugal variable
cross-mechanism operating at 6.612.

134
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:12,260
We're currently measuring the
magnitude of the inertial velocity.

135
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:16,138
Run a transporter check at 0400.
It's on an elliptical orbit.

136
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,344
Inertial reference
coordinate system, go.

137
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,476
Some of the solid particles are...

138
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:26,979
Engine room ready, sir.

139
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:30,031
The board shows green, captain.
All go.

140
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,074
Stand by.

141
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,198
Engage.

142
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,231
Warp 9.2.

143
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,945
351, mark 11, sir.
- Steady on that.

144
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,028
The hostile is now giving chase, sir.
Accelerating fast.

145
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:24,662
We're now at warp 9.3, sir,
which takes us past the red line.

146
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,416
Continue accelerating.

147
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:31,172
Counselor, at this point, I'm open
to guesses about what we've just met.

148
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:35,718
It felt like something beyond
what we'd consider a life-form.

149
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,344
Beyond?

150
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:43,305
Very, very advanced, sir,
or certainly very, very different.

151
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,186
We're at 9.4, sir.

152
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,609
Hostile is now beginning
to overtake us, sir.

153
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:48,856
You sure?

154
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,313
Hostile's velocity
is already warp 9.6, sir.

155
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,068
Shall I put them on the main viewer?

156
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,321
Reverse angle.

157
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,407
Magnifying viewer image.

158
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,671
Hostile's velocity is 9.7, sir.

159
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,965
Worf, inform
the engine room that we need more.

160
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,759
Engine room attempting
to comply, sir, but they caution us--

161
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,213
Go to yellow alert,
arm aft photon torpedoes,

162
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,924
- place them on ready status.
- Torpedoes to ready, sir.

163
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,929
Hostile now at warp 9.8, sir.

164
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,481
Our velocity is only 9.5, sir.

165
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:27,933
Projection, sir.

166
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,020
We may be able to match
hostile's 9.8, sir.

167
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,610
But at extreme risk.

168
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,575
Now reading the hostile at warp 9.9,
sir.

169
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,452
Now hear this.

170
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:47,456
Urgent. All stations on all decks,

171
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,250
prepare for emergency saucer sever.

172
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,380
You will command the saucer section,
lieutenant.

173
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,012
I'm a Klingon, sir.

174
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,719
For me to seek escape
when my captain goes into battle--

175
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,180
You are a Starﬂeet officer, lieutenant.

176
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,354
Aye, sir.

177
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,652
Make the mark, Data.

178
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,456
Note in ship's log that at this startime

179
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,164
I'm transferring command
to the Battle Bridge.

180
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,056
<i>Captain's log, stardate 41153.7.</i>

181
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:48,103
<i>Preparing to detach saucer section,
so that families</i>

182
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:52,104
<i>and the majority of the ship's company
can seek relative safety,</i>

183
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,355
<i>while the vessel stardrive,</i>

184
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,482
<i>containing the Battle Bridge
and main armaments,</i>

185
00:14:55,686 --> 00:15:01,193
<i>will turn back and confront
the mystery that is threatening us.</i>

186
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,580
It's okay, honey.

187
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:09,534
Check your name
at the computer terminals.

188
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,210
Yes, sir.

189
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:15,541
Lieutenant, your torpedoes must
detonate close enough to the hostile

190
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,376
- to blind it to the moment we separate.
- Understood, sir.

191
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:20,879
All decks acknowledging, sir.

192
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,589
Worf, this is the captain.

193
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:25,550
<i>At the moment of separation,
we will reverse power just enough</i>

194
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,261
<i>to get your saucer section
out ahead and clear of us.</i>

195
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,686
Understood, captain.

196
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,682
Torpedoes away, sir.

197
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,115
Begin countdown.

198
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,953
- Mark.
- Starship separation,

199
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:53,503
six, five, four, three,

200
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,039
two, one.

201
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,094
Separation is successful, sir.

202
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,674
Torpedoes have detonated, sir.

203
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,845
Let's come to a stop. Reverse power.

204
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:30,137
Reverse power. Decelerating.

205
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,642
Dead stop.

206
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:50,196
We'll hold this position
and wait for them.

207
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:54,199
That will bring them here
in just minutes, sir.

208
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:58,457
Will we make a fight of it, captain?
If we at least damage their ship,

209
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,629
- we have a chance--
- Lieutenant.

210
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:05,676
Are you recommending that we fight
a life-form that can do all those things?

211
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,181
I'd like to hear your advice.

212
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,265
I spoke before I thought, sir.

213
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,484
We should look for some way
to distract them

214
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:23,857
from going after the saucer.

215
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,068
All forward motion stopped, sir.

216
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,617
Thank you, conn.

217
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:44,465
Commander, signal the following
in all languages and on all frequencies.

218
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,717
We surrender.

219
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:51,802
State that we are not asking
for any terms or conditions.

220
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,929
Aye, sir.

221
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:57,683
All language forms and frequencies.

222
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,658
The prisoners will all stand.

223
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,006
Historically intriguing, captain.

224
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,547
Very, very accurate.

225
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:15,131
Mid-21 st century.
The post-atomic horror.

226
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,969
All present,

227
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:26,150
stand and make respectful attention
to honored judge.

228
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:35,781
Careful, sir.
This is not an illusion or a dream.

229
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,534
But these courts belong in the past.

230
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:43,001
I don't understand either,
but this is real.

231
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,623
Get to your feet, criminals.

232
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,575
At least we're acquainted
with the judge, captain.

233
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,060
Attention.

234
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:54,397
On your feet! Attention!

235
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,535
You're out of order.

236
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,355
The prisoners will not be harmed,

237
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:33,231
until they're found guilty.

238
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:36,693
Dispose of that.

239
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:48,542
Can we assume you mean
this will be a fair trial?

240
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,370
Yes, absolutely equitable.

241
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:03,599
Before this gracious court
now appear these prisoners

242
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:08,976
to answer for the multiple and
grievous savageries of the species.

243
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:12,020
How plead you, criminal?

244
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,602
If I may, captain?

245
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:17,772
Objection, Your Honor.

246
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,234
In the year 2036,
the New United Nations declared that

247
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:23,695
no Earth citizen could be made
to answer

248
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,201
for the crimes of his race or forbears.

249
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,657
Objection denied.

250
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:33,247
This is a court of the year 2079,
by which time more rapid progress

251
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:36,754
had caused all United Earth nonsense
to be abolished.

252
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,550
- Tasha, no.
- I must.

253
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:42,884
Because I grew up in a world
that allowed things like this court,

254
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:47,059
and it was people like these
that saved me from it.

255
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:52,561
This so-called court should get
down on its knees to what Starfleet is.

256
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,647
What it represents.

257
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:15,876
You barbarian.

258
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,423
This woman has done
nothing wrong!

259
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:18,670
Criminals, keep silent!

260
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,376
You've got a lot to learn about humans

261
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:24,259
if you think you can torture us
or frighten us into silence.

262
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:27,384
- Will she live?
- Uncertain.

263
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,389
When he froze Lieutenant Torres
on the Bridge,

264
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,186
we had our Sickbay
to help thaw him out.

265
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:33,765
You will answer the charges, criminal.

266
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:36,226
Or what? Or this?

267
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:39,904
Or death? Or worse?

268
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:43,024
You promised
the prisoners will not be harmed.

269
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:45,735
We plead nothing
so long as you break your own rules.

270
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:49,742
I suggest you center your attention
on this trial, captain.

271
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,790
It may be your only hope.

272
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,119
I suggest you are now having
second thoughts about it.

273
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:58,456
You are considering that if you conduct
a fair trial, which was your promise,

274
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,382
- you may lose.
- Lose?

275
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:03,210
Yes, even though you're judge
and prosecutor.

276
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:04,796
And jury-

277
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,132
Accepted,

278
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,259
so long as you keep
to your agreement.

279
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,811
And assaulting a prisoner
is hardly a fair trial.

280
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:16,850
This is a merciful court.

281
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:46,170
Silence!

282
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,549
Continuing these proceedings,
I must caution you

283
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:53,136
that legal trickery is not permitted.

284
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:56,222
- This a court of--
- A court of fact.

285
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:00,060
We humans know our past,
even when we're ashamed of it.

286
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:03,441
I recognize this court system

287
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:06,239
as the one that agreed
with that line from Shakespeare:

288
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,159
- "Kill all the lawyers."
- Which was done.

289
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,737
Leading to the rule,
guilty until proven innocent.

290
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:15,540
Of course, bringing the innocent to trial
would be unfair.

291
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:20,121
You will now answer to the charge
of being a grievously savage race.

292
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:22,627
"Grievously savage"
could mean anything.

293
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,879
I will answer only specific charges.

294
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:28,930
Are you certain you want
a full disclosure of human ugliness?

295
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,178
So be it, fool.

296
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,305
Present the charges.

297
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:38,936
Criminal,
you will read the charges to the court.

298
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:56,081
I see no charges against us,
Your Honor.

299
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:03,543
You are out of order.

300
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:17,637
Soldiers, you will press those triggers

301
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:21,315
if this criminal answers with any word
other than "guilty."

302
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:40,952
Criminal, how plead you?

303
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,207
Guilty.

304
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,634
Provisionally.

305
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,683
The court will hear the provision.

306
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,817
We question whether this court is
abiding by its own trial instructions.

307
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:08,441
Have I permission to have
Commander Data repeat the record?

308
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:09,817
There'll be no legal trickery.

309
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,945
These will be your own words,
Your Honor.

310
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,910
What exactly followed
His Honor's statement

311
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,612
that the prisoners will not be harmed?

312
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,493
Yes, sir.

313
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,913
The captain had asked the question:

314
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:26,088
"Can we assume you mean
this will be a fair trial?"

315
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:29,550
And in reply the judge stated:

316
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,924
"Yes, absolutely equitable."

317
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:36,348
Irrelevant testimony. Entirely irrelevant.

318
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,973
All right!

319
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:45,395
We agree there is evidence
to support the court's contention

320
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,601
that humans have been savage.

321
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,776
Therefore, I say, test us!

322
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:55,526
Test whether
this is presently true of humans.

323
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,908
I see. I see.

324
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,831
And so you petition the court
to accept you and your comrades

325
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:04,251
as proof
of what humanity has become?

326
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,746
There must be many ways
we can be tested.

327
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:09,502
We have a long mission ahead of us.

328
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:12,710
Another brilliant suggestion, captain.

329
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:15,671
But your test hardly requires
a long mission.

330
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:19,053
Your immediate destination
offers far more challenge

331
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:21,386
than you can possibly imagine.

332
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:27,604
Yes, this Farpoint Station
will be an excellent test.

333
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:33,109
All present, respectfully stand.

334
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:40,659
This court is adjourned
to allow the criminals to be tested.

335
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:45,910
This honorable court is adjourned.

336
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,922
Stand respectfully.

337
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:10,229
Captain, you may find
that you are not nearly clever enough

338
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:12,778
to deal with what lies ahead for you.

339
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:18,234
<i>It may have been better
to accept sentence here.</i>

340
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,922
What is present course, conn?

341
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,086
It's what it's been all along, sir.

342
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:41,219
Direct heading to Farpoint Station.

343
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,055
Confirmed.
We are on that heading, sir.

344
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,637
You know anything
about Farpoint Station, sir'?

345
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,313
Sounds like a fairly dull place.

346
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:52,977
We've heard that we may find it
rather interesting.

347
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:07,871
<i>Personal log, Commander
William Riker. Stardate 41153.7.</i>

348
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:11,079
<i>The USS Hood has dropped me off
at Farpoint Station</i>

349
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:14,540
<i>where I await the arrival
of the new USS Enterprise,</i>

350
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:16,921
<i>to which I have been assigned
as first officer.</i>

351
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:20,629
<i>Meanwhile, I've been asked to visit
the Farpoint administrator's office.</i>

352
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,090
<i>In the old city.</i>

353
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,966
Ah, Commander Riker,

354
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:27,974
I thought you'd want to know
we've still no word from your vessel.

355
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:30,146
I trust we've made your waiting
comfortable?

356
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:34,150
- Luxurious is more like it.
- Good.

357
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:36,691
Good.

358
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:39,573
Would I seem ungrateful
if I asked for some information?

359
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,987
Anything

360
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:45,742
Fascinating, the advanced materials
used in constructing this space station.

361
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:48,165
Your energy surplus must be
as abundant as I've heard.

362
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:51,209
Geothermal energy is one of
the great blessings of this planet.

363
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,708
I'll have all the details of that
sent to your quarters.

364
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:57,166
Thank you.
But it still seems incredible to me

365
00:31:57,374 --> 00:32:01,470
that you could've constructed
this station so rapidly and so...

366
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:04,014
So perfectly suited to our needs.

367
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:07,643
Would you care for an Earth delicacy,
commander?

368
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:10,096
Well, if there's an apple...

369
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:12,685
I'm sorry, commander.

370
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,438
Oh, it doesn't matter.
What I was saying was...

371
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:17,440
I'll be damned.

372
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,567
Ah, yes.

373
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,866
There was another selection here.

374
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:27,162
Groppler, I could have sworn
this wasn't here a minute ago.

375
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:31,750
And did your failure to notice it
make it unwelcome?

376
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,168
Not at all, Groppler.

377
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:37,248
I trust it will be the same
with Farpoint Station, commander.

378
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,879
A few easily answered questions
about it

379
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:43,758
won't make Starfleet
appreciate it less.

380
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,806
And it's delicious. Thank you.

381
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,218
- Good morning, Groppler Zorn.
- Good morning.

382
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:00,779
You have been told not to do that.

383
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,323
Why can't you understand?

384
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:06,197
It will arouse their suspicion.

385
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:10,201
And if that happens,
we will have to punish you.

386
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,534
We will, I promise you.

387
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,794
Dr. Crusher.

388
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:30,343
Mother. It's Commander Riker.

389
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,177
Hello, Wes.
Enjoying Farpoint Station?

390
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,432
Yes, sir.

391
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:35,639
I saw you,
I thought I might join you for a stroll.

392
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,145
Actually, we were about
to do some shopping.

393
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,569
I've been meaning
to visit the mall myself.

394
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:42,771
Of course.

395
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:46,737
If you're wondering about Mom,
Commander Riker,

396
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,444
she's not unfriendly.

397
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:50,325
She's just shy
around men she doesn't know.

398
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:53,408
Wesley. I believe that means
he would like us to be friends.

399
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,709
Oh, I'm willing, doctor.

400
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,916
Although we're not officially part
of the Enterprise,

401
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,794
I thought there might be something
useful we could do while we wait.

402
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,045
Useful? How, commander?

403
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,719
Investigating things
that I've noticed since I've been here.

404
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,136
The last was a piece of fruit--

405
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:09,760
- Gold would be lovely with this.
- I had asked for an apple--

406
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:12,309
I am sure, commander,
there are reasons for a first officer

407
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:15,729
to want to demonstrate his energy
and alertness to a new captain,

408
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:20,025
but since my duty and interests
are outside the command structure...

409
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:28,192
Isn't it remarkable he happened
to have exactly what you asked for?

410
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,074
Thank you.

411
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,284
I'll take the entire bolt.

412
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:38,790
Send it to our starship when it arrives.
Charged to Dr. Crusher.

413
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,339
Let's see, where were we?

414
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:49,012
I was accusing you
of inventing work

415
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,089
in order to curry favor
with our new captain.

416
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:52,390
I apologize.

417
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:55,891
Mom, that gold pattern wasn't there.

418
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,267
Maybe this is something Jean-Luc
would like looked into.

419
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,519
Jean-Luc Picard?

420
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:02,692
You know the captain.

421
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:07,736
When I was little, he brought
my father's body home to us.

422
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:10,984
Yes, Wes. Long, long ago.

423
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:14,822
A pleasure to meet you, commander.
Well, excuse us.

424
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,577
My pleasure, doctor.

425
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:17,998
- Wes
- Sir?

426
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,701
See you on board.

427
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,037
Yes, sir.

428
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,338
<i>Sir, the Enterprise is arriving</i> but--

429
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,166
Is this an official report, lieutenant?

430
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,626
Ahem. Sorry, commander.

431
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,178
Sir, Lieutenant La Forge reporting
the Enterprise arriving,

432
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,255
but without the saucer section, sir.

433
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,432
Stardrive section only?
What happened?

434
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:37,557
I don't know, sir. Captain Picard
has signaled for you to beam up.

435
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:40,935
Our new captain doesn't waste time.
It's a good idea.

436
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:43,100
- Thank you, lieutenant.
- Aye, sir

437
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,865
Enterprise, this is Commander Riker
at Farpoint Station.

438
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:52,238
Standing by to beam up.

439
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,688
Lieutenant Yar of Security, sir.

440
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,896
Captain Picard will see you
on the Battle Bridge.

441
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:33,942
With the saucer gone,

442
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,323
I assume something interesting
happened on the way here.

443
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,155
Battle Bridge.

444
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:41,333
That's for the captain to explain, sir.

445
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,330
Do we have clearance?

446
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:47,540
- Aye, sir, into standard parking orbit.
- Make it so.

447
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,751
Commander Riker, sir.

448
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:55,343
Riker, W.T. reporting as ordered, sir.

449
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:58,141
- Is the viewer ready?
- All set up, sir.

450
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,139
We'll first bring you up to date

451
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,812
on a little adventure we had
on our way here, commander.

452
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,059
Then we'll talk.

453
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:11,980
Welcome aboard.

454
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,200
This way, sir.

455
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,789
<i>Thou art directed to return</i>

456
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:32,717
<i>to thine own solar system
immediately.</i>

457
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:38,594
<i>Go back
or thou shalt most certainly die.</i>

458
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,886
<i>But you can't deny that you're still
a dangerous, savage, child race.</i>

459
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:47,350
Message from the saucer module, sir.
It will arrive here in 51 minutes.

460
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:49,480
Inform them we'll connect
as soon as they arrive.

461
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,937
And send the commander to me
when he's finished.

462
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:53,818
Yes, sir.

463
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,654
<i>And 400 years before that,
you were murdering each other</i>

464
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:59,077
<i>in quarrels over tribal god images.</i>

465
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:02,573
<i>Since then there are no indications
that humans will ever change.</i>

466
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,249
<i>There are preparations to make.</i>

467
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:09,797
<i>But when we next meet, captain,
we'll proceed exactly as you suggest.</i>

468
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:24,890
He calls that a little adventure?

469
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:27,768
Come.

470
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,196
Not exactly a run-of-the-mill
happening, captain.

471
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:45,115
It seems we're alive only because
we have been placed on probation.

472
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:46,953
A very serious kind of probation.

473
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,790
Go.

474
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:53,168
<i>The saucer module
now entering orbit with us, sir.</i>

475
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:55,296
Acknowledge.

476
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,806
Commander Riker will conduct
a manual docking. Picard out.

477
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,222
Sir?

478
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,471
You've reported in, haven't you?
You are qualified?

479
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:07,099
- Yes, sir.
- Then I mean now, commander.

480
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:25,868
They say you will be doing this
manually, sir. No automation.

481
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,915
As ordered.

482
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,017
Velocity to one-half meter per second.

483
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:05,570
Adjust pitch angle,
negative three degrees.

484
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,842
Watch your roll angle, conn.

485
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,938
All stations, prepare for reconnection.

486
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:56,997
Thrusters to station keeping.

487
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,883
All velocity zero.
Her inertia should do the job now.

488
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:07,595
Lock up, now.

489
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:56,060
A fairly routine maneuver,
but you handled it quite well.

490
00:41:56,931 --> 00:42:00,276
Thank you, sir.
I hope I show some promise.

491
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:03,438
I do have some questions for you,
however.

492
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,735
Yes, sir. I thought you might.

493
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:10,704
I see in your file that Captain DeSoto
thinks very highly of you.

494
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,120
One curious thing, however,

495
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:15,791
you refused to let him beam down
to Altair Ill.

496
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:19,000
In my opinion, sir,
Altair Ill was too dangerous

497
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,796
to risk exposing the captain.

498
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,170
I see.

499
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,047
Captain's rank means nothing to you.

500
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:27,804
Rather the reverse, sir.

501
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:30,265
But a captain's life means
a great deal more to me.

502
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:37,101
Isn't it just possible that
you don't get to be a Starfleet captain

503
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:40,775
without knowing whether it's safe
to beam down or not?

504
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,977
Isn't it a little presumptuous
of a first officer

505
00:42:43,186 --> 00:42:46,611
to second-guess
his captain's judgment?

506
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:50,026
Permission to speak candidly, sir?

507
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,695
Always.

508
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:56,829
Having been a first officer yourself,

509
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:59,206
you know that assuming
that responsibility

510
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,914
must, by definition,
include the safety of the captain.

511
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:06,126
I have no problem
with following any rules you lay down,

512
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:08,086
short of compromising your safety.

513
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,797
And you don't intend to back off
from that position?

514
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:12,803
No, sir.

515
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,687
One further thing.

516
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:21,057
- A special favor.
- Anything, sir.

517
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,609
Using the same strength
you showed with Captain DeSoto,

518
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,437
I would appreciate it
if you could keep me

519
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:28,489
from making an ass of myself
with children.

520
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:31,367
- Sir?
- I'm not a family man, Riker,

521
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:35,492
and yet, Starfleet has given me a ship
with children aboard.

522
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,119
- Yes, sir.
- And I, uh...

523
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:41,878
I don't feel comfortable with children.

524
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:47,042
But since a captain needs
an image of geniality,

525
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,552
you're to see that's what I project.

526
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:51,550
Aye, sir.

527
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:56,510
Welcome to the Enterprise,
Commander Riker.

528
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:05,644
Naturally, I've heard of your case.
The VISOR appliance you wear is--

529
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:08,605
Is a remarkable piece
of bioelectronic engineering

530
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:11,441
by which I quote "see"
much of the EM spectrum

531
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,322
ranging from simple heat
and infrared

532
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:15,494
through radio waves,
et cetera, et cetera,

533
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:20,166
and forgive me if I've said and listened
to this a thousand times before.

534
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:22,460
You've been blind all your life?

535
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,412
I was born this way.

536
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,793
And you've felt pain
all the years you've used this?

537
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:31,469
Mm. They say it's because I use
my natural sensors in different ways.

538
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,760
Well, I see two choices.

539
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:37,467
The first is painkillers.

540
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:40,645
- Which would affect how this works.
- Mm-hm.

541
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:42,062
No.

542
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:44,732
- And choice number two?
- Exploratory surgery.

543
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,481
Desensitize the brain areas
troubling you.

544
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,904
Same difference.

545
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:52,737
No, thank you, doctor.

546
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:56,031
I understand.

547
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,321
See you.

548
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:18,140
- Yes, sir?
- Where will I find Commander Data?

549
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:20,852
Commander Data
is on special assignment, sir.

550
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:24,101
He's using our shuttlecraft to transfer
an admiral over to the <i>Hood.</i>

551
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:25,352
An admiral?

552
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,979
He's been aboard all day, sir,
checking over medical layout.

553
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:30,403
Why a shuttlecraft?
Why wouldn't he just beam over?

554
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:31,775
I suppose he could, sir,

555
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:35,028
but the admiral is a rather
remarkable man.

556
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:36,359
Have you got some reason

557
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:39,537
you want my atoms
scattered all over space, boy?

558
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,114
No, sir. But at your age, sir,

559
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:42,915
I thought you shouldn't have
to put up with

560
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:44,617
the time and trouble of a shuttlecraft.

561
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:47,169
- Hold it right there, boy.
- Sir?

562
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:48,747
What about my age?

563
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:52,382
Sorry, sir, if that subject troubles you.

564
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:53,630
Troubles me?

565
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:58,139
What's so damn troublesome
about not having died?

566
00:45:58,339 --> 00:45:59,807
How old do you think I am, anyway?

567
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:03,352
One hundred thirty-seven years,
admiral, according to Starfleet records.

568
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:08,893
Explain how you remember that
so exactly.

569
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:11,520
I remember every fact
I'm exposed to, sir.

570
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:21,280
I don't see no points on your ears, boy,
but you sound like a Vulcan.

571
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:22,830
No, sir.

572
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,124
I'm an android.

573
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:26,876
Hm.

574
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:30,880
Almost as bad.

575
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,541
I thought it was generally accepted, sir,

576
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:37,299
that Vulcans are an advanced
and most honorable race.

577
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,505
They are, they are.

578
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:41,842
And damn annoying, at times.

579
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,392
Yes, sir.

580
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:48,348
Well, this is a new ship,
but she's got the right name.

581
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:51,651
- Now, you remember that, you hear?
- I will, sir.

582
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:54,354
You treat her like a lady,

583
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:58,608
and she'll always bring you home.

584
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:30,314
Did you signal the Hood,
Commander Riker?

585
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,734
<i>Your exact message.
"Bon voyage, mon ami. "</i>

586
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,277
What was the reply, computer?

587
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:39,654
<i>You're wasting time, captain.
Or did you think I was gone?</i>

588
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,156
Lieutenant.

589
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,080
Do you intend to blast a hole
in the viewer?

590
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,837
If the purpose of this
is to test humans, Your Honor,

591
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:54,630
we must proceed in our own way.

592
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,583
<i>You are dilatory. You have 24 hours.</i>

593
00:47:57,792 --> 00:47:58,839
<i>Any further delay</i>

594
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:03,048
<i>and you risk summary judgment
against you, captain.</i>

595
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:07,264
- Sorry, sir.
- You reacted fast, Mr. Worf.

596
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:09,562
But futilely.

597
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:12,185
I will learn to do better, sir.

598
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:17,232
Of course you will.
We've a long voyage ahead us.

599
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:22,575
What do we do now, captain?

600
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:24,869
With them monitoring our every move
and every word.

601
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:29,540
We do exactly what we'd do
if this Q never existed.

602
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:35,421
If we're going to be damned,
let's be damned for what we really are.

603
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:41,716
<i>Personal log, stardate 41153.8.</i>

604
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:45,219
<i>Of the 24 hours Q allotted us
to prove ourselves,</i>

605
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:48,142
<i>11 have now passed without incident.</i>

606
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,970
<i>And yet, I cannot forget Q's prediction</i>

607
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:54,523
<i>that we will face some critical test.</i>

608
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:57,818
This planet's interior heat provides
an abundance of geothermal energy,

609
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:00,237
but it's about all
that this world does offer.

610
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:02,611
And it's your belief
that this is what made it possible

611
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:05,193
for them to construct this base
to Starfleet standards?

612
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:08,405
Yes, sir. We have to assume they've
been trading their surplus energy

613
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,660
for the construction materials
used here.

614
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:12,287
According to our ship's scans,

615
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,914
many of the materials used
are not found on this world.

616
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,043
Perhaps it's like those incidents
you describe in your report

617
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:21,091
as almost magical attempts
to please us.

618
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:22,919
Those events did happen, sir.

619
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:28,220
None of it
suggests anything threatening.

620
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:32,349
If only every life-form
had as much desire to please.

621
00:49:33,262 --> 00:49:34,559
Ready to beam down?

622
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:37,357
I'm looking forward to meeting
this Groppler Zorn.

623
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:41,313
I have a feeling there's more to it
than just trying to please us, sir.

624
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,023
As if it's something Q is doing
to trick us?

625
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,357
Over here.

626
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:49,366
I've asked the counselor
to join us in this meeting.

627
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:53,082
May I introduce our new first officer,
Commander William Riker.

628
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:56,286
Commander Riker, this is
our ship's counselor, Deanna Troi.

629
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:01,625
<i>Do you remember what
I taught you, Imzadi?</i>

630
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:06,467
<i>Can you still sense my thoughts?</i>

631
00:50:07,046 --> 00:50:09,174
A pleasure, commander.

632
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:13,268
Likewise, counselor.

633
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:16,063
Have the two of you met before?

634
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,808
We have, sir.

635
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,860
Excellent.

636
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:28,568
I consider it important
for my key officers

637
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:31,325
to know each other's abilities.

638
00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:33,782
We do, sir.

639
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:36,284
We do.

640
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:40,751
<i>I too, could never say goodbye,
imzadi.</i>

641
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:52,974
My crew and I need more information

642
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,894
before we can make
our recommendations to Starﬂeet.

643
00:50:56,095 --> 00:50:57,847
No objections to that.

644
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:01,810
But I'm puzzled over you bringing
a Betazoid to this meeting.

645
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:05,195
If her purpose, sir,
is to probe my thoughts--

646
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:08,696
I can sense only strong emotions,
Groppler.

647
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:13,450
I'm only half Betazoid.
My father was a Starfleet officer.

648
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:16,453
Well, I have nothing to hide, of course.

649
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:20,958
Good, since we admire what we've
seen of your construction techniques.

650
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:26,418
Starfleet may be interested in your
constructing starbases elsewhere also.

651
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:29,219
We are not interested
in building other facilities.

652
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,388
If I may, captain?

653
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:33,933
Then a trade, Groppler.
Some things that you need

654
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:36,056
in return for lending us architects
and engineers

655
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,887
who could demonstrate
your techniques.

656
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:42,229
Bandi do not enjoy
leaving their home world.

657
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:46,316
If Starfleet cannot accept
that small weakness,

658
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,773
then we will be forced, unhappily,

659
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:52,235
to seek an alliance
with someone like the Ferengi.

660
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:00,618
Counselor, what is it'?

661
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:02,627
Do you want it described here, sir?

662
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:05,547
Yes. No secrets here
if we're to be all friends.

663
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:06,920
Agreed, Groppler?

664
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,922
We ourselves have nothing to hide,
of course.

665
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:14,845
Pain.

666
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:18,135
Pain.

667
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:23,394
Loneliness.

668
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,985
Terrible loneliness.

669
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,906
Despair.

670
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:39,032
I'm not sensing the Groppler, sir,
or any of his people,

671
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,618
but it's something very close
to us here.

672
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:46,331
The source of this, Groppler,
have you any idea?

673
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:48,006
No.

674
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:50,426
No, absolutely not.

675
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:53,721
And I find nothing helpful or productive
in any of this.

676
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,299
And that's it? No other comment?

677
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:58,054
Well, what do you expect of us?

678
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,260
We offer you a base
designed to your needs.

679
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:02,688
Luxurious by even human standards.

680
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:06,438
While evading
even our simplest questions about it.

681
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:08,982
We'll adjourn for now,

682
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:12,482
while we all reconsider our positions.

683
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:17,031
Captain, the Ferengi would be
very interested in a base like this.

684
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:22,288
Fine. Let's hope they find you as tasty
as they did their past associates.

685
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,930
Ensign, could you help me find
Commander Data?

686
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:38,724
I understand he's somewhere
on this deck.

687
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:43,304
This way, sir. You must be new
to these Galaxy-class starships, sir.

688
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:47,229
Tell me the location
of Commander Data.

689
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:52,613
<i>Lieutenant Commander
Data now located in holodeck area 4.J.</i>

690
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:56,033
And as you can see, sir,
it's pointing you that way.

691
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:59,616
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sir.

692
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,959
<i>The next hatchway on your right.</i>

693
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,871
<i>Thank you.
- You're welcome, Commander Riker.</i>

694
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,877
<i>And if you care to enter, commander?</i>

695
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,128
I do.

696
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:02,850
Hello?

697
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:49,188
Marvelous, how easily humans do that.

698
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:51,766
I still need much practice.

699
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:54,648
There's some puzzles down on the--

700
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:58,772
Down on the planet
that the captain wants answered.

701
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:01,484
He suggests I take you with me
on the away team I'll be leading.

702
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:04,161
I shall endeavor
to function adequately, sir

703
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,197
Yes.

704
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:14,546
When the captain suggested you,
I looked up your record.

705
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,999
Yes, sir. A wise procedure, sir. Always.

706
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,301
Then your rank of
lieutenant commander is honorary?

707
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,629
No, sir. Starfleet <i>class</i> of '78,

708
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:24,181
honors in probability and mechanics
and exobiology.

709
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,759
- But your file says that you're a--
- Machine. Correct, sir.

710
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:28,890
Does that trouble you?

711
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,471
To be honest, yes, a little.

712
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:34,309
Understood, sir.
Prejudice is very human.

713
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:37,736
Now, that does trouble me. Do you
consider yourself superior to us?

714
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,655
I am superior, sir, in many ways.

715
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:43,951
But I would gladly give it up
to be human.

716
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:45,778
Nice to meet you,

717
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,572
Pinocchio.

718
00:56:49,448 --> 00:56:50,574
A joke.

719
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,248
Ah. Intriguing.

720
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:58,294
You're going to be
an interesting companion, Mr. Data.

721
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,342
This woodland pattern is quite popular,
sir.

722
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,848
Perhaps because it duplicates Earth
so well.

723
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:13,476
Coming here
almost makes me feel human myself.

724
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,308
I didn't believe these simulations
could be this real.

725
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:18,018
Much of it is real, sir.

726
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:20,729
If the transporters can convert
our bodies to an energy beam,

727
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:23,111
- then back to the original pattern--
- Yes, of course.

728
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:25,659
And these rocks and vegetations
have much simpler patterns.

729
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:27,611
Correct, sir.

730
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:31,032
- The rear wall.
- I can't see it.

731
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:33,537
We're right next to it.

732
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:41,421
Incredible.

733
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:50,635
Commander Riker.

734
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:53,346
Commander Riker, isn't this great?

735
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:55,647
This is one of the simple patterns.

736
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:59,192
They've got thousands more.
Some you just can't believe.

737
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:01,942
Careful, the next rock is loose.

738
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,066
Wesley.

739
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:16,118
Wow.

740
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:30,971
Mr. Data has agreed to join me
on the away team, captain.

741
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:33,643
Very good, commander.

742
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:38,933
Sir, maybe I should get something
to wipe this water up.

743
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,313
Good idea.

744
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:52,113
There's a low-gravity gymnasium too.

745
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,573
It'd be hard to get bored on this ship.

746
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,499
Good.

747
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:05,755
Mom, could you get me a look
at the Bridge?

748
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,757
That's against the captain's
standing orders.

749
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:12,717
- Are you afraid of the captain too?
- I certainly am not.

750
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,514
But Captain Picard is a pain, isn't he?

751
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:17,767
Your father liked him very much.

752
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:22,772
Great explorers are often lonely.
No chance to have a family.

753
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,107
Just a look at the Bridge.

754
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:28,657
I'll stay in the turbolift
when the doors open. I won't get off.

755
00:59:28,857 --> 00:59:32,031
You are asking for trouble, Wes.

756
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:40,043
We'll see what we can do.

757
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:54,599
I recommend
that someone could begin

758
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,768
by examining the underside
of the station, sir.

759
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:59,221
<i>Our sensors do show
some passages, sir.</i>

760
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,602
Perhaps, you and I.

761
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:05,819
Tasha, you and the counselor. And,
Geordi, I want your eyes down there.

762
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:08,647
You and I will start topside.

763
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:41,767
Have you noticed anything unusual?

764
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:43,349
I can't see as well <i>as</i> Geordi, sir.

765
01:00:43,557 --> 01:00:45,400
But so far,
the material seems rather ordinary.

766
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,819
- Construction records?
- Construction records shows this

767
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:50,522
to be almost identical
to that which Starfleet uses.

768
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:55,327
<i>Team</i> leader.

769
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:57,825
We found something interesting.

770
01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:01,784
We're in a passageway
directly under the station, sir.

771
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:04,828
But these tunnel walls are something
I've never seen before, sir.

772
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:06,083
How're you examining them,
Geordi?

773
01:01:06,288 --> 01:01:07,335
In <i>every</i> way.

774
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:10,042
Microscopically, thermally,
electromagnetically.

775
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,752
None of it is familiar.

776
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,213
<i>And what about you, Troi?</i>

777
01:01:16,173 --> 01:01:19,643
Sir, I've avoided opening my mind.

778
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:23,313
Whatever I felt in the Groppler's office
became very uncomfortable.

779
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:26,187
I'm sorry, counselor, but you must.
We need more information.

780
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:34,237
Pain.

781
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:38,244
Such pain.

782
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:40,242
Pain.

783
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:43,417
Hang on, I'm coming.
Enterprise, lock us on to her signal.

784
01:01:54,586 --> 01:01:55,929
I'm sorry.

785
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:57,597
Close your mind to the pain.

786
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:01,096
Unhappiness.

787
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:03,929
Terrible despair.

788
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:05,980
Who?

789
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:09,526
I don't know.

790
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:12,354
No life-form anything like us.

791
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:15,031
What in the hell kind of place is this?

792
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:17,154
Geordi, what do you see?

793
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:20,158
Well, it's of...

794
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:26,251
It's of no material I recognize, sir,
or have even heard of.

795
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:51,651
What the hell?

796
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:54,900
Children are not allowed on the Bridge.

797
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:03,573
Permission to report to the captain.

798
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:05,080
Dr. Crusher.

799
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:08,292
Captain.

800
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:10,378
Sir, my son is not on the Bridge,

801
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:12,956
he merely accompanied me
on the turbolift.

802
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:19,800
Your son?

803
01:03:20,005 --> 01:03:22,349
His name's Wesley.

804
01:03:23,091 --> 01:03:26,345
You last saw him years ago when...

805
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:29,682
Hm.

806
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:38,489
Well,

807
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:42,536
as long as he's here...

808
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:47,078
Ahem. I, uh...

809
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:50,539
I <i>knew...</i>

810
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,748
I knew your father, Wesley.

811
01:03:58,293 --> 01:03:59,761
Want to look around?

812
01:04:19,147 --> 01:04:21,525
But don't touch anything.

813
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:41,044
Try it out.

814
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:50,470
The panel on your right
is for log entries,

815
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:55,400
library computer access and retrieval,
view-screen control and intercom.

816
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,978
- Here we have--
- The backup conn and ops panels,

817
01:04:58,186 --> 01:04:59,904
plus shield and armament controls.

818
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:03,655
Hm. The forward view screen is
controlled from the ops position there.

819
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:06,577
Which uses high-resolution,
multi-spectral imaging sensors.

820
01:05:06,778 --> 01:05:08,246
How the hell do you know that, boy?

821
01:05:09,823 --> 01:05:10,870
Perimeter alert, captain.

822
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:12,326
- Wesley.
- I'm sorry.

823
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:15,378
- You shouldn't have touched anything.
- Get off the Bridge. Both of you.

824
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:16,955
You have a perimeter alert, sir.

825
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:19,916
As my son tried to tell you.

826
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:24,467
Picard. Go ahead.

827
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:26,344
<i>Ship's sensors have detected
the presence</i>

828
01:05:26,548 --> 01:05:28,095
<i>of a vessel approaching this planet.</i>

829
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:30,552
<i>No ship is scheduled to arrive
at this time, sir.</i>

830
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,730
Have Commander Riker and his team
beam back up.

831
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,853
Security,
could that be the Hood returning here?

832
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:39,231
<i>The vessel does not match
the Hood's configuration or ID signal.</i>

833
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:41,530
Put it on main viewer.

834
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:43,068
Identification?

835
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:45,196
Vessel unknown,
configuration unknown, sir.

836
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:56,332
Hail it.

837
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:59,877
We've been trying, sir. No response.

838
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:06,887
Raise all shields, phasers at ready.

839
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:09,967
Shields up, sir, phasers ready.

840
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:30,365
Get me Groppler Zorn.

841
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:33,115
And continue universal greetings
on all frequencies.

842
01:06:33,323 --> 01:06:34,950
<i>This is Zorn, captain.</i>

843
01:06:35,158 --> 01:06:38,788
Zorn, an unidentified vessel
has entered into orbit with us.

844
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:40,372
<i>Do you know who it is?</i>

845
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:43,129
There are no ships scheduled
to arrive until--

846
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:45,427
I asked you if you knew who it is.

847
01:06:45,627 --> 01:06:47,595
You mentioned the Ferengi Alliance
to me.

848
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:52,176
But we've had no dealings with them.

849
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,143
It was only a thought.

850
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:56,554
- <i>Are you certain?</i>
- <i>I promise you, captain</i>

851
01:06:57,180 --> 01:07:01,902
We were making an empty threat.
I wanted your cooperation. Forgive me.

852
01:07:02,101 --> 01:07:03,899
Definitely entering orbital trajectory, sir.

853
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:06,572
It measures 12 times our volume,
captain.

854
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:42,942
Sensors say we were just scanned, sir.

855
01:07:47,689 --> 01:07:49,657
Pain again?

856
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:53,361
Troi, you've been at it enough.

857
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:55,243
No.

858
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:57,957
I feel close to an answer of some kind.

859
01:07:58,157 --> 01:08:02,207
Commander, something down here
is shielding our communicators.

860
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:05,507
Yes, that's exactly the feeling
I've been reading,

861
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:08,961
as if someone doesn't want us
to be in touch with our ship.

862
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:11,546
Come on, let's get to the surface.

863
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:21,894
There is no computer record
of any such vessel, sir.

864
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:23,350
Nothing even close.

865
01:08:23,558 --> 01:08:26,607
Still no response, sir. We've done
everything but threaten them.

866
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,818
Sensor scans, Mr. Worf.

867
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:36,326
Our sensor signals
just seem to bounce off.

868
01:08:36,571 --> 01:08:38,790
Something's happening, sir.

869
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:43,954
- They're firing on Farpoint, sir.
- Bring photon torpedoes to ready.

870
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:47,541
Wait, sir. They're hitting the old
Bandi city, not Farpoint Station.

871
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:08,440
Those stairs are where
we entered down here, sir.

872
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:11,569
At this point it becomes ordinary stone,
sir. Matching what's above.

873
01:09:14,776 --> 01:09:16,619
My God, was that a phaser blast?

874
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:19,447
Negative, but something similar.

875
01:09:22,325 --> 01:09:24,578
You, Tasha, Geordi will beam up
to the ship now. Come on.

876
01:09:24,786 --> 01:09:27,335
I wanna see exactly what's happening.

877
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:34,171
Don't! If you should be hurt...

878
01:09:34,796 --> 01:09:37,515
You have your orders, lieutenant.
Carry them out.

879
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:41,052
Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

880
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:48,026
<i>Enterprise, three to beam up.</i>

881
01:09:57,276 --> 01:10:00,246
<i>Enterprise. Enterprise, come in.</i>

882
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:01,663
Help us, please!

883
01:10:04,992 --> 01:10:06,164
What shall we do?

884
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:08,497
<i>Enterprise, help us, please!</i>

885
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:10,423
Tune that down.

886
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:12,546
Commander Riker, come in.
Can you hear me?

887
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:20,470
<i>Riker to Enterprise, come in.</i>

888
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:23,053
<i>Commander Riker, come in.
Where are you?</i>

889
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:26,014
With Data,
on the edge of the old city, sir.

890
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,017
It's being hit hard, sir.

891
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:31,273
And Farpoint Station,
any damage there?

892
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:34,071
<i>Negative on damage to Farpoint, sir.</i>

893
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:36,445
<i>Whoever they are,
they're avoiding hitting the station.</i>

894
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:39,903
It's from an unidentified vessel
that's entered into orbit with us here.

895
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:42,034
<i>No ID, no answer to our signals.</i>

896
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:44,582
The old Bandi city's being hit hard, sir.

897
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:48,161
- Many casualties very probable.
- Understand, commander.

898
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:52,124
Would you object to your captain
ordering a clearly illegal kidnapping?

899
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:54,671
No objection, sir.

900
01:10:55,126 --> 01:10:57,800
Groppler Zorn may have
the answers we need.

901
01:10:58,004 --> 01:10:59,130
Get him. Bring him here.

902
01:10:59,338 --> 01:11:00,430
Aye, sir.

903
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:10,771
They're forcing a very
difficult decision on me, counselor.

904
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:14,400
But I doubt protecting the Bandi
would violate the Prime Directive.

905
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:16,277
True, they are not actual allies, but--

906
01:11:16,481 --> 01:11:20,327
We are in the midst
of diplomatic discussions with them.

907
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:23,822
Lieutenant,
lock phasers on that vessel.

908
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,578
Phasers locked on, captain.

909
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:31,375
Typical. So typical.

910
01:11:31,579 --> 01:11:35,584
Savage life-forms never follow
even their own rules.

911
01:11:43,549 --> 01:11:45,927
Get off my Bridge.

912
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:49,138
Interesting, that order about phasers.

913
01:11:49,347 --> 01:11:50,769
Standing by on phasers, captain.

914
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:53,522
Please, don't let me interfere.
Use your weapons.

915
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:55,444
We've no idea of who
is on that vessel.

916
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:57,522
My order was
a routine safety precaution.

917
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,903
Really? No idea what it represents?

918
01:12:00,107 --> 01:12:01,950
The meaning of that vessel is as plain,

919
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:05,451
as plain as the noses
on your ugly little primate faces.

920
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:07,578
And if you were truly civilized, captain,

921
01:12:07,782 --> 01:12:11,457
wouldn't you be doing something about
the casualties happening down there?

922
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:14,540
Captain to CMO,
are you reading any of this?

923
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:17,500
Medical team is already preparing
to beam down, captain.

924
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:20,341
Compliments on that, doctor.

925
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:21,717
Any questions?

926
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:24,720
Starfleet people are trained to render
aid and assistance whenever--

927
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:27,302
But not trained in clear thinking.

928
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:30,059
Let's consider your thoughts.
You call us savages

929
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:33,062
and yet, you knew those people
down there were going to be killed.

930
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:35,564
It is your conduct that is uncivilized.

931
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:38,403
Sir, they're firing on the planet again.

932
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:42,779
Go to maneuvering jets.

933
01:12:42,984 --> 01:12:45,078
Position us between that vessel
and the planet.

934
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:48,452
- Forcefields full on.
- Aye, sir.

935
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:52,497
Impulse power to...

936
01:12:53,244 --> 01:12:54,746
We have no ship control, sir.

937
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:57,878
It's gone.

938
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:16,063
Are you undamaged?

939
01:13:16,434 --> 01:13:18,152
Yes. You?

940
01:13:26,193 --> 01:13:28,696
All systems operating.

941
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:49,676
Please. Make it stop.

942
01:13:49,884 --> 01:13:51,682
You can drive it away.

943
01:13:51,886 --> 01:13:54,014
Drive who away, Groppler?

944
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:55,973
- I don't know.
- Unlikely, sir.

945
01:13:56,390 --> 01:14:00,190
Our records show you supervised
all Bandi contact with other worlds.

946
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:01,896
We've done nothing wrong.

947
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:04,823
Then if we can learn nothing from you,
we'll leave.

948
01:14:05,024 --> 01:14:07,868
No. Oh, no, please, don't leave.

949
01:14:08,069 --> 01:14:10,913
I'll try to explain.

950
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:22,630
<i>First Officer to Enterprise.</i>

951
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:27,388
We've lost Zorn.

952
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:32,059
Something like a transporter beam
seems to have snatched him away.

953
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:34,011
<i>Question, sir.</i>

954
01:14:34,512 --> 01:14:35,980
<i>Could it be this Q?</i>

955
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,353
None of you knows
who transported him.

956
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:40,525
You're running out of time, captain.

957
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:42,228
Captain.

958
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:44,696
Suddenly I'm sensing something else.

959
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:49,322
Satisfaction.

960
01:14:50,111 --> 01:14:52,034
Enormous satisfaction.

961
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:54,332
From same source as before?
- No.

962
01:14:54,824 --> 01:14:57,043
That was on the planet.
This is much closer.

963
01:14:57,243 --> 01:15:00,122
Excellent, counselor.
He's such a dullard, isn't he?

964
01:15:03,207 --> 01:15:04,709
<i>Captain, from transporter room.</i>

965
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:07,295
<i>First officer and Mr. Data
have beamed aboard.</i>

966
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:10,256
Excellent also. Perhaps with more
of these little minds helping--

967
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:11,511
That is enough, damn it!

968
01:15:11,716 --> 01:15:13,559
Have you forgotten
that we have an agreement?

969
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:15,761
An agreement which you are,
at this moment, breaking

970
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:19,099
by taking over our vessel,
interfering with my decisions.

971
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:22,776
Either leave or finish us!

972
01:15:22,977 --> 01:15:24,399
Temper, temper, mon capitaine.

973
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:28,107
I'm merely trying to assist
a pitiful species.

974
01:15:28,315 --> 01:15:29,658
But perhaps I will leave,

975
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:32,112
if Commander Riker provides me
with some amusement.

976
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:33,741
Do nothing that he asks.

977
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:35,448
But I ask so little.

978
01:15:35,656 --> 01:15:38,626
And it's so necessary
if you're to solve all this.

979
01:15:38,826 --> 01:15:42,330
Beam over there with your-- What do
you call it? Your away team?

980
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,586
I'll risk none of my crew
on that unknown.

981
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:46,633
You should already know
what you'll find there.

982
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:48,836
Or perhaps
it's too adult a puzzle for you.

983
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:53,926
With all respect, captain,
I want to beam over there.

984
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:56,352
You show promise, my good fellow.

985
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:59,681
Have you understood any part
of what he's tried to tell you?

986
01:15:59,889 --> 01:16:02,608
Humanity is no longer a savage race.

987
01:16:04,143 --> 01:16:06,487
But you must still prove that.

988
01:16:12,943 --> 01:16:15,913
At least you impressed him,
Number One. That's hopeful.

989
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:18,666
Thank you, captain.

990
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:22,420
Captain, if he's not open to evidence
in our favor,

991
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:23,997
where will you go from there?

992
01:16:24,205 --> 01:16:25,502
I'll attend to my duty.

993
01:16:26,123 --> 01:16:27,249
To the bitter end?

994
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:31,053
I see nothing so bitter about that.

995
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:39,387
Can I help you, captain?

996
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,644
I, uh...

997
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:46,569
I didn't want you thinking me harsh,
cold-blooded.

998
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:48,487
Why, oh, why would I ever think that?

999
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:52,241
I didn't welcome you aboard
personally, professionally.

1000
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:55,411
I made you come to me on the Bridge,
I yelled at your son.

1001
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:58,660
Who, as you pointed out,
was quite correct.

1002
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:03,043
He does seem to have a very good
grasp of starship operations.

1003
01:17:04,495 --> 01:17:06,589
You've just won this mother's heart,
captain.

1004
01:17:07,832 --> 01:17:10,085
Ah. But, uh...

1005
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:12,966
Now, your assignment here,

1006
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:16,765
I would consider

1007
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:20,266
and approve a transfer for you.

1008
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:24,398
Oh. Do you consider me unqualified?

1009
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:26,396
Hardly. Your service record shows

1010
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,069
you're just the chief medical officer
I want.

1011
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:30,863
Then you must object to me
personally.

1012
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:33,862
I'm trying to be considerate
of your feelings, doctor.

1013
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:36,285
For you to work
with a commanding officer

1014
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:41,286
who would continually remind you
of a terrible personal tragedy.

1015
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:43,413
If I had had any objections
to sewing with you,

1016
01:17:43,617 --> 01:17:46,245
I wouldn't have requested
this assignment, captain.

1017
01:17:48,247 --> 01:17:49,464
You requested this posting?

1018
01:17:49,874 --> 01:17:52,047
My feelings about my husband's death
will have no affect

1019
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:55,095
on the way I serve you,
this vessel or this mission.

1020
01:17:57,548 --> 01:17:58,640
Ah.

1021
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:02,186
Then welcome aboard, doctor.

1022
01:18:02,803 --> 01:18:06,307
<i>Riker to Picard.
We're ready to beam over, sir.</i>

1023
01:18:07,892 --> 01:18:10,862
I hope we can be friends.

1024
01:18:11,979 --> 01:18:13,196
Thank you.

1025
01:18:26,076 --> 01:18:28,170
Phasers on stun.

1026
01:18:35,002 --> 01:18:36,845
Energize.

1027
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:58,151
Most interesting, sir.

1028
01:18:59,777 --> 01:19:03,202
It's the same construction we saw
in the underground tunnel.

1029
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:05,373
But no sound of power.

1030
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:07,576
No equipment.

1031
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:10,496
How does this ship run?

1032
01:19:13,374 --> 01:19:14,921
What is it, Troi?

1033
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:17,093
Is it the same as you felt down there?

1034
01:19:17,294 --> 01:19:18,887
No.

1035
01:19:19,546 --> 01:19:22,766
This is much more powerful.

1036
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:26,053
Full of anger...

1037
01:19:26,512 --> 01:19:29,186
- ...hate.
- Toward us?

1038
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:31,063
No.

1039
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:34,862
It's directed down toward
the old Bandi city.

1040
01:19:35,062 --> 01:19:37,815
Most intriguing again, sir.

1041
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:42,699
The place that this vessel was firing
upon was not the Farpoint Starbase,

1042
01:19:42,903 --> 01:19:45,827
but the home of those
who constructed--

1043
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:49,289
Sorry, sir.

1044
01:19:50,077 --> 01:19:53,047
I seem to be commenting
on everything.

1045
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:55,416
Good.

1046
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:58,544
Don't stop, my friend.

1047
01:20:04,174 --> 01:20:06,097
Enterprise, <i>Riker.</i>

1048
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:10,432
<i>This is turning out to be
a very long tunnel or corridor, sir.</i>

1049
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:12,437
No ship's crew in sight.

1050
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:15,440
No sign of mechanism or circuitry.

1051
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:18,564
No controls or readouts.

1052
01:20:19,398 --> 01:20:22,493
This is nothing like any vessel
I've seen before.

1053
01:20:22,693 --> 01:20:25,116
Groppler Zorn, sir.

1054
01:20:25,612 --> 01:20:28,206
And great fear just ahead.

1055
01:20:28,782 --> 01:20:32,457
<i>There's a different feeling here
than in the tunnel.</i>

1056
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:34,671
<i>Very different.</i>

1057
01:20:36,165 --> 01:20:38,759
No! Please! No more, please!

1058
01:20:38,959 --> 01:20:40,211
No more!

1059
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:46,475
Please! Make it stop the pain!

1060
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:53,354
Please. Please. Make it stop the pain.

1061
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:59,773
No! Please! No more!
Please, no more!

1062
01:21:00,647 --> 01:21:05,699
- Please! Make it stop the pain! Ah!
- Zorn, can you hear me?

1063
01:21:06,653 --> 01:21:08,155
No!

1064
01:21:08,364 --> 01:21:12,119
- Has the alien communicated?
- No. Please. Please.

1065
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:14,123
- Please, no more!
- That's it, sir.

1066
01:21:14,328 --> 01:21:18,299
No, no more!
- It's just one alien I'm sensing here.

1067
01:21:18,499 --> 01:21:21,878
Please.
I don't understand what it wants!

1068
01:21:22,086 --> 01:21:24,509
- Not true, he does know.
- No, please! No more!

1069
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:28,013
Please. No more!

1070
01:21:29,134 --> 01:21:33,435
Oh, no. No! Don't! Don't! Don't!

1071
01:21:42,272 --> 01:21:43,444
Captain!

1072
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:47,654
Transporter chief,
yank them back now.

1073
01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:48,953
Riker, acknowledge.

1074
01:21:50,531 --> 01:21:52,659
Your time is up, captain.

1075
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:55,953
Transporter chief,
do you have their coordinates?

1076
01:21:56,161 --> 01:21:58,459
- Transporter chief.
- He can't hear you, captain.

1077
01:21:58,664 --> 01:22:00,792
Transporter chief, come in.

1078
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:09,804
I have people in trouble over there, Q.

1079
01:22:15,848 --> 01:22:17,976
Everyone at ease. That's an order.

1080
01:22:21,019 --> 01:22:24,193
Q, my people are in trouble.

1081
01:22:24,398 --> 01:22:27,618
Let me help them, please.

1082
01:22:31,572 --> 01:22:34,121
I'll do whatever you say.

1083
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:43,335
You'll do whatever I say.

1084
01:22:45,878 --> 01:22:47,801
It seems I did make that bargain.

1085
01:22:48,005 --> 01:22:51,134
The agreement isn't valid, sir.
It wasn't Q that saved us.

1086
01:22:51,341 --> 01:22:53,093
Save yourself. It may attack you now.

1087
01:22:54,011 --> 01:22:55,638
It was that which sent us back,
captain.

1088
01:22:55,846 --> 01:22:59,567
Yes, sir. It is not merely a vessel,
somehow it is alive.

1089
01:22:59,766 --> 01:23:01,643
She lies.
Destroy it while you have a chance.

1090
01:23:01,852 --> 01:23:03,650
Make phasers
and photon torpedoes ready.

1091
01:23:03,854 --> 01:23:05,572
No. Do nothing he demands.

1092
01:23:05,772 --> 01:23:07,570
Captain,
that thing was killing my people.

1093
01:23:07,774 --> 01:23:09,902
- Was there a reason?
- It is an unknown, captain.

1094
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:11,236
Isn't that enough?

1095
01:23:11,778 --> 01:23:13,826
If you had earned that uniform
you're wearing,

1096
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:16,625
you'd know that the unknown
is what brings us out here.

1097
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:18,953
Wasted effort,
considering human intelligence.

1098
01:23:19,161 --> 01:23:20,754
Let's test that.

1099
01:23:20,954 --> 01:23:23,423
Beginning with the tunnels
you have under Farpoint, Groppler.

1100
01:23:23,624 --> 01:23:27,128
Identical to those on the space vessel
life-form over there.

1101
01:23:27,336 --> 01:23:29,054
Why was it punishing you, Groppler?

1102
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:32,383
In return for some pain
you'd given another creature?

1103
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:35,891
We've done nothing wrong.
It was injured, we helped it.

1104
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:39,932
Thank you.

1105
01:23:40,516 --> 01:23:42,610
That was the missing element.

1106
01:23:42,809 --> 01:23:47,736
Lieutenant Yar, rig main phaser banks
to deliver an energy beam.

1107
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:49,942
- Aye, sir.
- You're right, captain.

1108
01:23:50,776 --> 01:23:53,495
It has to be conceivable
that somewhere in this galaxy,

1109
01:23:53,695 --> 01:23:57,040
there could exist creatures
able to convert energy into matter.

1110
01:23:57,241 --> 01:24:01,337
And into specific patterns of matter,
just as our transporters do.

1111
01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:02,709
On the viewer, captain.

1112
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:40,371
Groppler.

1113
01:24:41,118 --> 01:24:44,873
You captured something like that,
didn't you?

1114
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:50,382
Warn my people, please,
to leave Farpoint Station immediately.

1115
01:24:50,586 --> 01:24:52,839
He lies, captain.
Shouldn't you let his people die?

1116
01:24:53,046 --> 01:24:54,093
Transmit the message:

1117
01:24:54,298 --> 01:24:56,175
"Leave Farpoint Space Station
immediately."

1118
01:24:56,383 --> 01:24:58,761
Then it was a pair of creatures
I was sensing.

1119
01:24:59,303 --> 01:25:04,981
One down there in grief and pain,
the other up here filled with anger.

1120
01:25:05,183 --> 01:25:07,402
And firing not
on the new space station,

1121
01:25:08,228 --> 01:25:10,902
but on the Bandi and their city.

1122
01:25:11,481 --> 01:25:14,360
Attacking those who had captured--

1123
01:25:17,362 --> 01:25:18,864
Captured its mate.

1124
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:27,965
Energy beam ready, sir.

1125
01:25:28,165 --> 01:25:30,133
Lock it in on Farpoint Station.

1126
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:35,719
I see now it was too simple a puzzle.

1127
01:25:35,922 --> 01:25:39,597
Generosity
has always been my weakness.

1128
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:43,021
Let it have whatever it can absorb.

1129
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:45,273
Energize.

1130
01:26:03,033 --> 01:26:05,331
Now getting feedback
on the beam, sir.

1131
01:26:05,535 --> 01:26:07,458
Discontinue.

1132
01:26:08,622 --> 01:26:09,839
Groppler Zorn,

1133
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:14,382
there'll soon be no Farpoint Station,
if I'm right about this.

1134
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:16,133
A lucky guess.

1135
01:26:36,817 --> 01:26:39,115
Please believe me,
we meant no harm to the creature.

1136
01:26:39,319 --> 01:26:41,071
It was starving for energy.

1137
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:43,202
Which your world furnishes you
in plenty.

1138
01:26:43,407 --> 01:26:46,411
- And we did feed it.
- But only enough to keep it alive

1139
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:49,713
so that you could force it to shape itself
into whatever form you needed.

1140
01:28:05,906 --> 01:28:07,658
Sir.

1141
01:28:08,492 --> 01:28:10,460
It's wonderful.

1142
01:28:15,373 --> 01:28:18,593
A feeling of great joy.

1143
01:28:20,003 --> 01:28:22,176
And gratitude.

1144
01:28:26,593 --> 01:28:31,224
Great joy and gratitude.

1145
01:28:33,183 --> 01:28:35,686
From both of them.

1146
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:59,798
Why do you use other life-forms
for your recreation?

1147
01:29:00,043 --> 01:29:02,216
If so, you've not provided the best--

1148
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:05,173
Leave us. We've passed your little test.

1149
01:29:05,382 --> 01:29:07,510
Temper, temper, mon capitaine.

1150
01:29:07,717 --> 01:29:09,219
Get off my ship.

1151
01:29:09,427 --> 01:29:12,476
I do so
only because it suits me to leave.

1152
01:29:15,725 --> 01:29:19,229
But I will not promise
never to appear again.

1153
01:29:32,742 --> 01:29:36,372
<i>Captain's log, stardate 41174.2.</i>

1154
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:39,049
<i>The agreement for the rebuilding
of Farpoint Station</i>

1155
01:29:39,249 --> 01:29:41,968
<i>has been completed
per my instructions.</i>

1156
01:29:42,168 --> 01:29:45,672
- All stations?
- Ready for departure, sir.

1157
01:29:48,091 --> 01:29:49,388
Some problem, Riker?

1158
01:29:49,593 --> 01:29:52,563
Just hoping this isn't the usual way
our missions will go, sir.

1159
01:29:52,762 --> 01:29:54,605
Oh, no, Number One.

1160
01:29:54,806 --> 01:29:58,151
I'm sure most
will be much more interesting.

1161
01:30:00,812 --> 01:30:03,531
Let's see what's out there.

1162
01:30:04,357 --> 01:30:05,609
Engage.
