1
00:00:08,073 --> 00:00:09,700
You're dead, Spencer.

2
00:00:13,812 --> 00:00:14,936
What you doing, Shawn?

3
00:00:14,937 --> 00:00:16,000
Nothing.

4
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:17,138
Looks like something to me.

5
00:00:17,848 --> 00:00:21,078
Okay. I was running away
from Ryan Brickhouse.

6
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:22,880
- That him?
Mmm-hmm.

7
00:00:22,881 --> 00:00:25,079
Is he the same kid who's been
hassling you all week?

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,248
Yeah.

9
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,227
Why is he
chasing you today?

10
00:00:32,228 --> 00:00:34,525
I might have thrown
a rock at him.

11
00:00:36,499 --> 00:00:38,228
Did you hit him?
Almost.

12
00:00:42,237 --> 00:00:43,669
Get back out there.
What?

13
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,638
You can't run away from the
bad guys forever, Shawn.

14
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:47,868
Eventually, you got to come up
with a new approach.

15
00:00:47,869 --> 00:00:48,966
So?

16
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:51,137
So, find one.

17
00:01:00,788 --> 00:01:02,118
You're flunking math?

18
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:03,452
Probably.

19
00:01:04,992 --> 00:01:07,322
Here's the deal.
Leave me alone,

20
00:01:07,323 --> 00:01:09,486
I'll make sure
you ace the test tomorrow.

21
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:11,962
How?
Every third answer is "C."

22
00:01:11,963 --> 00:01:13,999
There's a pattern
to all our tests.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,432
Mrs. Bodansky
does it every time.

24
00:01:16,433 --> 00:01:18,527
I memorized it.
I'll show you.

25
00:01:18,528 --> 00:01:20,697
You better not be lying.

26
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:29,044
Not bad. You faced your fears. You
got a new result. You came out ahead.

27
00:01:30,015 --> 00:01:31,913
Did you really memorize
those test answers?

28
00:01:31,914 --> 00:01:33,177
Yeah.

29
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,524
Who are you calling?

30
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,954
Your math teacher.

31
00:01:52,536 --> 00:01:54,560
No, no,
no, no, no.

32
00:01:54,561 --> 00:01:56,663
Yes. Yes.

33
00:01:57,907 --> 00:01:59,874
Nickel. That's a nickel.

34
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:02,136
Yes. Yes. Yes.

35
00:02:02,137 --> 00:02:03,541
Who is that?
Who is who?

36
00:02:03,542 --> 00:02:04,840
The girl sitting
in our front desk.

37
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:07,108
Ah, you're talking
about the lovely Dagmar.

38
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:09,013
Dagmar? She's our
new receptionist.

39
00:02:09,014 --> 00:02:10,141
How did she get the job?

40
00:02:10,142 --> 00:02:11,741
Agency sent her over.

41
00:02:11,742 --> 00:02:14,185
You contacted a temp agency
without consulting me?

42
00:02:14,186 --> 00:02:16,849
Gus, anyone can get a
secretary from a temp agency.

43
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:20,052
It takes real foresight and creativity
to get one from a modeling agency.

44
00:02:20,053 --> 00:02:21,823
A modeling agency?

45
00:02:23,798 --> 00:02:25,231
Wow.

46
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,366
Now, why would a beautiful lady
like that want to be our secretary?

47
00:02:32,173 --> 00:02:34,038
Oh, that's a bit
of a story, you see.

48
00:02:34,575 --> 00:02:37,406
Apparently, she got it in her
head that this was a runway gig.

49
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,706
I blame the agent.
I was very clear on the phone.

50
00:02:39,707 --> 00:02:43,475
But she's cool with sticking around for
the rest of the day and seeing how it goes.

51
00:02:43,476 --> 00:02:46,211
You know how slow it gets
when it's not modeling season.

52
00:02:46,212 --> 00:02:47,377
Does she answer the phone?

53
00:02:47,378 --> 00:02:50,717
Yes. But only her cell phone.
She's expecting a call from Milan.

54
00:02:50,718 --> 00:02:51,914
Does she file?

55
00:02:51,915 --> 00:02:53,047
Mostly her nails.

56
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:55,183
Coffee?
Yes, she wants some.

57
00:02:55,184 --> 00:02:56,954
Can I make you anything?
No.

58
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,563
Dude, I thought you weren't
coming in till, like, noon.

59
00:03:00,564 --> 00:03:04,031
Big drama at the office today. A
doctor we supply product to got killed.

60
00:03:04,032 --> 00:03:06,728
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You didn't call me immediately?

61
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:07,827
You don't know him.

62
00:03:07,828 --> 00:03:10,236
Gus, this is what we do.
Remember? We can solve the case.

63
00:03:10,237 --> 00:03:11,399
The police are already there.

64
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,571
This means nothing to me. They're going
to need help, guidance, psychic vibrations.

65
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:17,807
Dagmar?

66
00:03:22,986 --> 00:03:24,783
She doesn't speak English?

67
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,116
Does she need to?

68
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:35,691
Where in the name of all
that is holy is my forensics team?

69
00:03:36,822 --> 00:03:38,763
All right, what can you
tell me about this doctor

70
00:03:38,764 --> 00:03:40,800
that I can pretend to ascertain
from the spirit world?

71
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:42,460
Dr. Blinn wasn't
on my route.

72
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:44,163
I did cover him
a few times.

73
00:03:44,164 --> 00:03:45,967
All I remember is
he always made you wait

74
00:03:45,968 --> 00:03:47,836
and he had a picture
of Pete Rose on his wall.

75
00:03:47,837 --> 00:03:50,036
Look how cute she is
in the fuchsia.

76
00:03:52,146 --> 00:03:54,078
I have been sent
by the spirit of Pete Rose.

77
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,204
Pete Rose isn't dead.

78
00:03:55,205 --> 00:03:56,873
There was a photo of Pete Rose
on the wall.

79
00:03:56,874 --> 00:03:59,110
Okay, why have I been drawn
here? Was there a murder?

80
00:03:59,111 --> 00:04:01,050
Do I need the little booties
for the crime scene?

81
00:04:01,051 --> 00:04:03,146
Thanks, but we're doing
just fine.

82
00:04:07,593 --> 00:04:09,288
Don't go in the back room.

83
00:04:10,897 --> 00:04:12,659
My grandpa
loved Pete Rose.

84
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,993
All right, I want you guys
ringing doorbells.

85
00:04:13,994 --> 00:04:16,295
If anybody in the neighborhood saw
anything, I want to know about it.

86
00:04:16,296 --> 00:04:18,528
Patient files. Cabinet's locked.
We haven't found the key.

87
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:21,298
Get ahold of the DA's office. Tell
him I need access to those files.

88
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:22,964
If they say we need
a warrant, get it.

89
00:04:22,965 --> 00:04:25,509
Also, get me a copy
of his desk calendar.

90
00:04:26,745 --> 00:04:28,769
I thought I told you no.

91
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,507
But your eyes said yes.

92
00:04:30,508 --> 00:04:34,073
Hey, who's that Cincinnati Red
over there with the bowl cut?

93
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:43,283
Let me be perfectly clear.
This is my crime scene.

94
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:45,383
I don't need your help.
I don't want your help.

95
00:04:45,384 --> 00:04:47,291
If you don't leave right now,
I will have you arrested

96
00:04:47,292 --> 00:04:49,023
for interfering with
a police investigation.

97
00:04:49,024 --> 00:04:50,463
Am I clear?

98
00:04:51,301 --> 00:04:53,030
Like butter.

99
00:04:59,374 --> 00:05:01,899
I've given this
a great deal of thought.

100
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,109
I think we should take
the rest of the day off.

101
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,611
What say you?

102
00:05:05,612 --> 00:05:08,581
All we've done is eat up a box of
animal cookies and crash a crime scene.

103
00:05:08,582 --> 00:05:09,706
The case with the doctor.

104
00:05:09,707 --> 00:05:12,081
They're coming back to us
eventually. You know this.

105
00:05:12,082 --> 00:05:15,212
So, let's go to the beach. It's too
nice a day for murder and mayhem.

106
00:05:15,213 --> 00:05:18,281
I have
to see him right now. It's important.

107
00:05:18,726 --> 00:05:23,162
I'm sorry. I don't mean to
barge in, but I need help.

108
00:05:25,932 --> 00:05:29,800
Mr. Dunn, Robert, how can
we help? And can I call you Bob?

109
00:05:30,637 --> 00:05:32,069
This is difficult.

110
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,129
Take your time. We're here.
Yeah.

111
00:05:35,407 --> 00:05:37,466
I'm just gonna
come out and say it.

112
00:05:39,278 --> 00:05:40,869
I'm being haunted.

113
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,039
Haunted?
Yes.

114
00:05:43,382 --> 00:05:45,178
Haunting?

115
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,749
He's crazy.

116
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,944
Gus, can I talk
to you outside?

117
00:05:47,945 --> 00:05:49,508
Not now, Shawn. We're in
the middle of something.

118
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:51,714
Gus.
Stop talking. Sit down.

119
00:05:51,956 --> 00:05:56,017
Now, what exactly do you mean
when you say, haunted?

120
00:05:56,694 --> 00:05:59,491
Well, my home,

121
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:03,054
sometimes I smell perfume
when no one else is around.

122
00:06:03,055 --> 00:06:05,499
Things get broken or move.

123
00:06:05,702 --> 00:06:07,601
Oh, Gus, I
think you have a text message.

124
00:06:07,602 --> 00:06:10,401
I'll get it later. I think
you should get it now.

125
00:06:18,314 --> 00:06:20,475
Sorry. Work business.

126
00:06:20,716 --> 00:06:21,910
Okay.

127
00:06:23,452 --> 00:06:25,578
Can I ask you a question?
Yeah. Yeah.

128
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:28,986
Do these spirits ever
speak to you?

129
00:06:28,987 --> 00:06:30,922
No. No. Whatever,

130
00:06:31,493 --> 00:06:34,052
whoever it is,
it hasn't spoken to me.

131
00:06:34,053 --> 00:06:36,926
Oh. Have you
contacted the police?

132
00:06:36,927 --> 00:06:39,591
Yeah. But they said that there
was nothing they could do.

133
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:41,596
So, here I am.

134
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:46,270
Robert, we deal with this kind
of phenomenon all the time.

135
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:49,468
What you need to realize
is that evicting a spirit

136
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:53,841
is a very time-consuming and
absurdly expensive process.

137
00:06:53,842 --> 00:06:57,576
I don't care, okay? I just
can't go on living this way.

138
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,512
Excuse me.

139
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,680
Oh, really?
Yes!

140
00:07:02,681 --> 00:07:03,914
Yes, Shawn.

141
00:07:03,915 --> 00:07:06,183
Look, all I'm saying is
that it might be easier

142
00:07:06,184 --> 00:07:10,785
to try moving into a different
house, one that's less haunted.

143
00:07:10,786 --> 00:07:11,953
I've tried that.

144
00:07:11,954 --> 00:07:14,793
Whatever this thing is, it followed
me all the way from San Francisco.

145
00:07:14,794 --> 00:07:16,162
Maybe it likes you.

146
00:07:16,163 --> 00:07:18,257
No, I don't think so.

147
00:07:18,258 --> 00:07:20,098
What makes you say that?

148
00:07:21,172 --> 00:07:23,538
I think it tried to kill me.

149
00:07:29,914 --> 00:07:33,212
<i>I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth</i>

150
00:07:33,516 --> 00:07:36,507
<i>I know, you know
They just don't have any proof</i>

151
00:07:36,508 --> 00:07:39,748
<i>Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend</i>

152
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:44,282
<i>Your worst inhibitions tend
to psych you out in the end</i>

153
00:07:52,234 --> 00:07:54,225
Gus, what is all this?

154
00:07:54,737 --> 00:07:56,293
Gear we might need.

155
00:07:56,294 --> 00:07:59,202
If we're going to be hunting
spirits, we might as well do it right.

156
00:07:59,203 --> 00:08:02,139
Methodically, systematically,
scientifically.

157
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,837
Who knows, we might be
surprised what we find.

158
00:08:04,838 --> 00:08:08,540
Video camera? Nice. Audio
recorder, motion detectors.

159
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,241
Gus, I'm very impressed.

160
00:08:10,242 --> 00:08:12,307
You only forgot one thing.

161
00:08:12,308 --> 00:08:13,373
Really? What?

162
00:08:13,374 --> 00:08:15,443
There's no such thing
as ghosts.

163
00:08:15,444 --> 00:08:16,852
Yes, there is.

164
00:08:16,853 --> 00:08:18,287
Oh, Gus, no.

165
00:08:18,288 --> 00:08:19,517
Okay.

166
00:08:19,518 --> 00:08:21,082
Stop.

167
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,423
Please. Let's just,
let's just stop.

168
00:08:23,424 --> 00:08:25,794
Come here, sit down.
Please, sit.

169
00:08:30,436 --> 00:08:32,801
All right, this is me
talking. This is Shawn.

170
00:08:32,802 --> 00:08:35,464
What's going on? I usually to
have to drag you to these cases,

171
00:08:35,465 --> 00:08:37,939
kicking and screaming, and
those are real police cases.

172
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,102
Now, all of a sudden we have
some client who's either bonkers

173
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,146
or, judging by the size
of the bags under his eyes,

174
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:45,773
suffering from nothing more than
waking dreams or hallucinations

175
00:08:45,774 --> 00:08:48,283
and you, you're ready
to go ghost-hunting.

176
00:08:49,953 --> 00:08:51,317
Talk to me.

177
00:08:51,318 --> 00:08:52,820
All right.

178
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:56,191
All right.

179
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:01,192
I never told this to
anyone before, but I was 12.

180
00:09:02,431 --> 00:09:04,126
Gus, it's me.

181
00:09:07,703 --> 00:09:09,170
It was late.

182
00:09:09,472 --> 00:09:11,996
I was in my room
with the lights off.

183
00:09:11,997 --> 00:09:13,539
I heard a voice.

184
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,802
Gus, I'm sure there's a
perfectly logical explanation.

185
00:09:15,803 --> 00:09:19,676
No, no, no, Shawn. It wasn't
on TV and it wasn't a radio.

186
00:09:19,677 --> 00:09:21,578
It was coming from the walls.

187
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:23,140
And the voice,

188
00:09:23,485 --> 00:09:24,917
the voice told me

189
00:09:24,918 --> 00:09:28,113
that our house was built on
an old Indian burial ground.

190
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,178
Shut up.

191
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:31,554
And she said...

192
00:09:31,792 --> 00:09:34,487
She said she was sad because
she had died many moons ago

193
00:09:34,488 --> 00:09:36,496
and was trapped
between worlds.

194
00:09:36,931 --> 00:09:39,524
When I asked her
her name, Shawn,

195
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,630
she said,

196
00:09:43,203 --> 00:09:46,138
"My name..." "My name is Wilting Flower.

197
00:09:46,506 --> 00:09:49,566
"I died without knowing love.

198
00:09:49,976 --> 00:09:52,034
"Will you be my friend?"

199
00:09:53,078 --> 00:09:54,806
How did you know that?

200
00:09:54,807 --> 00:09:56,608
I never told that
to anyone before.

201
00:09:56,609 --> 00:09:58,649
I was Wilting Flower.

202
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:02,982
Gus! I can't believe
that you fell for that.

203
00:10:02,983 --> 00:10:07,752
I put an old walkie-talkie in the wall
when your dad put in the new insulation.

204
00:10:07,753 --> 00:10:11,123
The old Indian burial ground,
you bought that?

205
00:10:11,124 --> 00:10:14,494
<i>I got that from Poltergeist
or Poltergeist II.</i>

206
00:10:15,366 --> 00:10:17,731
<i>Gremlins?
No, it wasn't Gremlins.</i>

207
00:10:18,268 --> 00:10:19,996
That's not funny, Shawn.

208
00:10:19,997 --> 00:10:22,629
You know what? Let's add
a "Trixie" to that.

209
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,436
She is the companion
to "Scrappy", right?

210
00:10:25,675 --> 00:10:29,007
Okay, great. Let's add that
to Girl With Flowers

211
00:10:29,008 --> 00:10:30,874
and Merry Musicians.

212
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:35,610
Okay, now listen, I need the
card to read, "Happy birthday.

213
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:39,646
"'Ex' is the loneliest letter
in the alphabet."

214
00:10:39,647 --> 00:10:43,179
But I need you to spell it,
E-X, as in...

215
00:10:44,225 --> 00:10:45,521
Oh, you got it.

216
00:10:45,522 --> 00:10:47,457
Okay, well, see,
it continues,

217
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:53,329
"From your not yet 'ex',
E-X, husband,

218
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,925
"Carlton."

219
00:10:55,802 --> 00:10:57,895
Perfect. These will
go out today, right?

220
00:10:58,438 --> 00:11:00,872
All righty-dighty.
Thank you very much.

221
00:11:01,308 --> 00:11:03,172
I didn't know
you collected figurines.

222
00:11:03,173 --> 00:11:05,904
You know, I have a
grandmother... Do you not knock?

223
00:11:05,905 --> 00:11:07,503
There's no door.

224
00:11:07,781 --> 00:11:08,837
And?

225
00:11:08,838 --> 00:11:11,348
Sorry. The DA's office called.

226
00:11:11,349 --> 00:11:13,577
They said that we can have access
to Dr. Blinn's patients' files.

227
00:11:13,578 --> 00:11:14,915
About time.

228
00:11:15,321 --> 00:11:16,617
Let's go get in there,
get those addresses.

229
00:11:16,618 --> 00:11:18,657
Bring these nut jobs
in for questioning.

230
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,193
Here's where I found all my
paintings last weekend upside down.

231
00:11:26,194 --> 00:11:28,789
I've got
a cold spot. Right here.

232
00:11:29,968 --> 00:11:31,492
Feel it?
Yes.

233
00:11:32,203 --> 00:11:34,795
Yes, I do. Robert, we've
definitely got something here.

234
00:11:34,796 --> 00:11:37,102
You're standing
under a vent.

235
00:11:47,051 --> 00:11:48,710
So, all these are yours, huh?

236
00:11:48,711 --> 00:11:51,810
Yeah. I'm trying to
get ready for a show.

237
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:55,550
No kidding. Has anything
strange ever happened here?

238
00:11:55,551 --> 00:11:59,116
Sometimes I get the feeling that
the furniture has been moved.

239
00:11:59,117 --> 00:12:00,683
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.

240
00:12:00,684 --> 00:12:02,194
Did you actually
see it happen?

241
00:12:02,195 --> 00:12:06,496
No, no, I just come into a room and
everything's not where I left it.

242
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,437
Robert, do you have
a photo album?

243
00:12:15,438 --> 00:12:16,601
Yeah.

244
00:12:19,714 --> 00:12:20,464
Ah.

245
00:12:23,384 --> 00:12:24,544
Hmm.

246
00:12:25,618 --> 00:12:27,141
That's a nice shot, huh?

247
00:12:27,142 --> 00:12:31,281
I feel it! I feel it.

248
00:12:31,524 --> 00:12:34,014
Oh, Gus, Gus, oh!

249
00:12:34,015 --> 00:12:35,924
Oh! She is angry!

250
00:12:35,925 --> 00:12:38,156
She is angry! She is soaring!

251
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,595
With rage and...

252
00:12:40,825 --> 00:12:42,490
She wants to go
to the bedroom!

253
00:12:42,491 --> 00:12:43,625
Where's the bedroom?

254
00:12:43,626 --> 00:12:46,569
It's here! Here!
Take me! Oh!

255
00:13:00,051 --> 00:13:01,541
I've lost her.

256
00:13:04,221 --> 00:13:05,414
You don't believe me,
do you?

257
00:13:05,415 --> 00:13:08,787
No, no, of course we do.
You saw it, too, didn't you?

258
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,087
Guys,

259
00:13:10,594 --> 00:13:12,993
please, stay the night.

260
00:13:12,994 --> 00:13:14,427
Then you'll see.

261
00:13:14,428 --> 00:13:16,488
I mean, you don't know
what it's been like.

262
00:13:16,489 --> 00:13:19,089
I can't work.
I can't concentrate.

263
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,397
I wake up in the morning more
tired than when I went to bed.

264
00:13:21,398 --> 00:13:24,997
Days pass when I can't
remember what I've done...

265
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,940
This pulls out into a bed,
but that's all I got.

266
00:14:04,941 --> 00:14:08,672
Oh, no worries. What's a little
spooning between old pals, huh, Gus?

267
00:14:08,673 --> 00:14:09,974
Well, good night.

268
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:11,742
Good night, Robert.

269
00:14:11,743 --> 00:14:13,010
You got the floor.

270
00:14:13,011 --> 00:14:14,449
Oh, we'll make it work.

271
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:17,715
You don't mind if I nude
up for the sleepover, right?

272
00:14:17,716 --> 00:14:21,553
Seriously, Shawn, only one of us is sleeping
at a time. The other one is on watch.

273
00:14:21,554 --> 00:14:23,455
Oh, no, we'll both sleep.

274
00:14:23,456 --> 00:14:25,790
I'll put on some socks, make
you feel more comfortable.

275
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,957
Stop playing, Shawn.
We're here to solve a case.

276
00:14:30,401 --> 00:14:31,765
I already solved it.

277
00:14:31,766 --> 00:14:34,064
When? When you were flapping
a book like a bird?

278
00:14:34,065 --> 00:14:37,594
Gus, if you must know,
it was a bald eagle.

279
00:14:37,595 --> 00:14:39,071
And, yes.

280
00:14:41,377 --> 00:14:42,604
You found the ghost?

281
00:14:42,605 --> 00:14:44,009
There's no such thing
as ghosts.

282
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,239
Yes, there is, Shawn.

283
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,305
No, there isn't, but there is such
thing as a pissed off ex-girlfriend.

284
00:14:48,306 --> 00:14:49,906
What ex-girlfriend?

285
00:14:49,907 --> 00:14:51,815
No one mentioned
anything about an ex.

286
00:14:51,816 --> 00:14:53,912
You didn't look
at the photo album?

287
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,482
Redhead. She's cute.

288
00:14:57,483 --> 00:14:59,048
What makes you think
she's an ex?

289
00:14:59,049 --> 00:15:01,219
Oh, come on, there's dirty
dishes everywhere.

290
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:05,288
His bedroom is a mess, his nails
are filthy, his hair is horrible.

291
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,364
No girlfriend is gonna
put up with that.

292
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:08,925
And, exhibit A,

293
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:12,601
who else would "X" through his
face in all these pictures?

294
00:15:12,602 --> 00:15:16,130
Okay. Okay, say
she's the ex,

295
00:15:16,977 --> 00:15:18,500
we still don't know
if she's actually been here.

296
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:21,513
There are strands of red hair
all over the studio.

297
00:15:27,253 --> 00:15:28,742
Should we tell Robert?

298
00:15:28,743 --> 00:15:30,378
How psychic would that be?

299
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:31,979
No, we'll spend the night.
It's fine.

300
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,387
Catch up with
the ex tomorrow.

301
00:15:33,388 --> 00:15:34,982
Talk to her,
see what's going on.

302
00:15:34,983 --> 00:15:37,493
Meanwhile, I'm going to do
some sit-ups.

303
00:15:37,494 --> 00:15:39,223
Come hold my feet.

304
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,658
I'm going to do a thousand.

305
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:01,149
Shawn! Get up! Fire!

306
00:16:05,288 --> 00:16:06,653
Get Robert!

307
00:16:11,127 --> 00:16:12,856
I could have died.

308
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,729
If you guys weren't here, I...

309
00:16:17,432 --> 00:16:21,458
Why is it doing this to me?
Why is it trying to kill me?

310
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:24,562
Okay. Okay, Robert,
hey, hey, hey.

311
00:16:25,607 --> 00:16:28,336
Hey, Bobby, look at me.

312
00:16:28,337 --> 00:16:32,376
Now, who here has communicated
with more dispossessed souls,

313
00:16:32,377 --> 00:16:33,777
you or me?

314
00:16:34,315 --> 00:16:35,542
You?
That's correct.

315
00:16:35,543 --> 00:16:40,018
Now, I am telling you that this, this
fire was not an attempt on your life.

316
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:41,418
It wasn't?
No.

317
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:44,617
This was a sad
and desperate cry for help

318
00:16:44,618 --> 00:16:47,523
from a very frightened,
very lonely apparition.

319
00:16:47,524 --> 00:16:49,926
Are you sure about this?
Absolutely.

320
00:16:50,897 --> 00:16:54,492
Of course it's also possible that
someone simply left a candle burning.

321
00:16:55,033 --> 00:16:56,363
I don't burn candles.

322
00:16:56,364 --> 00:16:58,061
Gus, did you burn
a candle?

323
00:16:58,062 --> 00:17:00,400
Why would I do that?
Cry for help it is.

324
00:17:00,973 --> 00:17:02,701
No one came in
while we were sleeping.

325
00:17:02,702 --> 00:17:04,070
I checked the doors
and windows.

326
00:17:04,071 --> 00:17:05,541
They were all locked

327
00:17:06,378 --> 00:17:07,470
from the inside.

328
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:15,342
Why are you looking
at me like that?

329
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,078
That's all you did? Checked
the doors and the windows?

330
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,645
Yeah, why?

331
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,991
Where did that come from?

332
00:17:31,992 --> 00:17:34,729
Don't look at me.
I'm not wearing lipstick.

333
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:40,072
This is the only post office
box listed for Regina Kane.

334
00:17:40,073 --> 00:17:42,302
According to Dr. Blinn's calendar,
she was his last appointment.

335
00:17:42,303 --> 00:17:44,675
She might have seen
something. I want to find her.

336
00:17:44,676 --> 00:17:47,270
Well, if this is where she picks up
her mail, she probably lives close by.

337
00:17:47,271 --> 00:17:49,247
Canvas the neighborhood,
see if anyone knows her.

338
00:17:49,248 --> 00:17:51,012
That's a really
smart approach.

339
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:53,247
What? That,
that shocks you?

340
00:17:53,248 --> 00:17:54,844
I meant that
as a compliment.

341
00:17:54,845 --> 00:17:56,287
Really?
Yeah.

342
00:17:57,225 --> 00:17:58,782
Thanks a lot.

343
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,486
Was that sarcastic?

344
00:18:01,495 --> 00:18:03,087
No.
Oh.

345
00:18:03,597 --> 00:18:05,861
Okay. You're welcome.

346
00:18:08,068 --> 00:18:09,592
<i>Do you still think
it's the ex-girlfriend?</i>

347
00:18:09,903 --> 00:18:12,096
A woman scorned
is a woman with motive.

348
00:18:12,097 --> 00:18:13,934
We need to talk
to this woman.

349
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,403
You're on your own. I'm tied up
with work for the rest of the week.

350
00:18:17,404 --> 00:18:18,875
Gus, that's so lame.

351
00:18:19,745 --> 00:18:21,076
Pull over.

352
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,712
Good morning,
detectives.

353
00:18:25,713 --> 00:18:27,808
Collecting donations
for the Policeman's Ball?

354
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:29,649
We don't have balls.

355
00:18:31,756 --> 00:18:33,052
I honestly have
no response to that.

356
00:18:33,053 --> 00:18:35,182
Need I remind you,
Mr. Spencer,

357
00:18:35,183 --> 00:18:37,352
what happens when you interfere
with a police investigation?

358
00:18:37,353 --> 00:18:39,555
The case gets solved?

359
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,889
Wait a minute, you guys are working
on that murder thingy, right?

360
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:45,833
I completely forgot
about that. How's that going?

361
00:18:49,707 --> 00:18:53,436
Silly question. We'll let you guys
get back to your investigating.

362
00:18:53,437 --> 00:18:54,942
Bye, Juliet.

363
00:18:56,112 --> 00:18:57,305
Okay, where to next?

364
00:18:57,306 --> 00:19:00,815
Listen, we change our clothes, we get some
lunch, then I have to get back to work.

365
00:19:00,816 --> 00:19:02,509
Gus, the plot is thickening.

366
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,777
Shawn, I've already missed
two days this week.

367
00:19:03,778 --> 00:19:06,547
Oh, fine, fine, fine.
I respect your wishes.

368
00:19:06,548 --> 00:19:07,814
Thank you.
Jerk chicken.

369
00:19:07,815 --> 00:19:09,550
You know that's right.

370
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:14,891
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
- There he is.

371
00:19:15,964 --> 00:19:18,124
What time is it?
Daytime.

372
00:19:20,801 --> 00:19:22,325
What happened?

373
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:26,234
I might have dropped six allergy pills
in your frosty while you were peeing.

374
00:19:26,235 --> 00:19:28,365
You did what?
Where are we?

375
00:19:28,366 --> 00:19:30,431
Palo Alto.
San Francisco?

376
00:19:30,432 --> 00:19:31,942
No, but close.

377
00:19:31,943 --> 00:19:35,205
Robert's ex-girlfriend lives up here,
Gus, and we really need to talk to her.

378
00:19:35,206 --> 00:19:36,406
I will kill you, Shawn.

379
00:19:36,407 --> 00:19:38,109
And then you're going to
buy me some new tires.

380
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,117
Oh, come on. This is fun.
Road trip.

381
00:19:40,118 --> 00:19:43,245
Kidnapping.
That's exactly what this is.

382
00:19:43,956 --> 00:19:45,685
That's it. We're not talking.

383
00:19:50,662 --> 00:19:52,289
What, seriously?

384
00:19:59,337 --> 00:20:01,304
So, we're really
not talking now?

385
00:20:01,305 --> 00:20:02,565
Come on,
how mature is this?

386
00:20:02,566 --> 00:20:05,369
The silent treatment is not how
conflict gets resolved, Gus.

387
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:09,070
We need to work through this,
we need to share our feelings,

388
00:20:09,071 --> 00:20:10,511
maybe a smoothie.

389
00:20:16,052 --> 00:20:17,212
Yes?

390
00:20:18,021 --> 00:20:19,886
Never mind.
It's not her.

391
00:20:21,857 --> 00:20:23,256
Pardon me.

392
00:20:36,104 --> 00:20:38,299
What do I mean,
"It's not her?"

393
00:20:38,973 --> 00:20:41,406
Lips. The lips don't match.

394
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:44,467
The lips that kissed your forehead
do not belong to Amy Kessler.

395
00:20:44,468 --> 00:20:46,843
Therefore,
she's not our ghost.

396
00:20:51,813 --> 00:20:56,048
"You didn't drive all the way out here so
you could say, 'It's not her' and leave.

397
00:20:56,049 --> 00:20:57,988
"We're talking to hep."

398
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,324
"Her."

399
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:09,967
"Carlton,

400
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:13,766
"separation means apart."

401
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:18,039
What you got there?
Nothing.

402
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,576
Are you okay?

403
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:21,875
Of course I'm okay.
You look sad.

404
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,777
I am sad.
Why are you sad?

405
00:21:24,778 --> 00:21:28,909
I'm sad because I don't have my
forensics report on my dead doctor.

406
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:31,476
Or a lead on my possible
witness, Regina Kane.

407
00:21:31,477 --> 00:21:32,953
What about that psychic guy?

408
00:21:32,954 --> 00:21:34,853
Isn't Shawn great
at this sort of thing?

409
00:21:34,854 --> 00:21:36,949
Finding people. I mean,
maybe we should bring him...

410
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:40,223
Maybe you should just
keep your ideas to yourself.

411
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,527
That's a joke, right?

412
00:21:42,866 --> 00:21:44,026
Yes.

413
00:21:45,134 --> 00:21:46,999
Yes, it is.
Okay.

414
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:54,835
Very nice.

415
00:21:55,511 --> 00:21:57,809
Exquisite brush strokes.

416
00:21:58,413 --> 00:21:59,606
It's a print.

417
00:21:59,607 --> 00:22:01,774
I'm referring, of course,
to the original.

418
00:22:02,551 --> 00:22:04,642
I'm sorry, what's the name
of your gallery again?

419
00:22:04,643 --> 00:22:07,312
That's been a bit
of a problem, actually.

420
00:22:07,313 --> 00:22:10,823
<i>We wanted to call it
Le Petit Louvre,</i>

421
00:22:10,824 --> 00:22:14,121
but apparently
the art snobs in France

422
00:22:14,122 --> 00:22:17,129
think they have a monopoly
on all things Louvre.

423
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:19,864
We also tried
Louvre Two,

424
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,125
Louvre, Junior,

425
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,430
Night Gallery,
nothing cleared.

426
00:22:25,431 --> 00:22:29,405
The important thing is we want to
show the amazing work of Robert Dunn

427
00:22:29,406 --> 00:22:31,442
and he listed you
as a character reference.

428
00:22:31,443 --> 00:22:36,310
Oh, we are very select with the clients
that we take on, isn't that right, Francois?

429
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:40,215
I have to admit, I'm surprised Robert
would list me as a character reference.

430
00:22:40,216 --> 00:22:42,514
We dated for a period
and it didn't end well.

431
00:22:42,515 --> 00:22:43,678
Can I ask why?

432
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,746
Not to pry, but he did
list you as a reference.

433
00:22:46,747 --> 00:22:49,223
The usual, forgetting dates,
standing me up,

434
00:22:49,224 --> 00:22:52,990
sometimes he'd get so wrapped up in his
work he'd disappear for days at a time.

435
00:22:52,991 --> 00:22:54,962
The worst was when he cheated
on me and lied about it.

436
00:22:54,963 --> 00:22:58,432
Oh. You must have been
burning with furious anger.

437
00:22:58,433 --> 00:22:59,866
He was just so stupid.

438
00:22:59,867 --> 00:23:02,496
A girlfriend of mine saw him
at a club with another woman.

439
00:23:02,497 --> 00:23:05,564
He was drunk and pretended that she
had him confused with someone else.

440
00:23:05,565 --> 00:23:08,871
He said his name was,
get this, Martin Brody.

441
00:23:08,872 --> 00:23:10,741
Martin Brody?

442
00:23:10,742 --> 00:23:12,746
<i>Roy Scheider's character
from Jaws?</i>

443
00:23:12,747 --> 00:23:14,680
Yes. How did you know?

444
00:23:15,585 --> 00:23:16,881
<i>I've seen Jaws.</i>

445
00:23:16,882 --> 00:23:19,182
It's his favorite movie. Anyway,
when I asked him about it,

446
00:23:19,183 --> 00:23:21,312
he pretended he'd never
even heard of the club.

447
00:23:21,313 --> 00:23:24,358
That's... horrible.

448
00:23:24,926 --> 00:23:27,224
You must have
wanted to kill him.

449
00:23:27,896 --> 00:23:30,694
Probably not
so much anymore.

450
00:23:31,132 --> 00:23:33,929
You're pretty happily
engaged, aren't you?

451
00:23:34,702 --> 00:23:37,136
Yes. Isn't the ring great?

452
00:23:46,346 --> 00:23:48,541
Okay, so
she's not our ghost.

453
00:23:49,048 --> 00:23:51,572
Even the longest journeys
can start with a tiny misstep.

454
00:23:51,573 --> 00:23:53,881
Overall, still
a very good day.

455
00:23:54,621 --> 00:23:56,349
How is it a good day?

456
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,048
Oh, come on, Gus.

457
00:23:58,049 --> 00:24:00,590
First of all, road trip,
always fun.

458
00:24:00,591 --> 00:24:03,218
We got some fresh-baked
sourdough, very nice.

459
00:24:03,219 --> 00:24:05,558
And the agency is sending us
a new secretary tomorrow.

460
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:07,962
And yes, she speaks
English fluently.

461
00:24:07,963 --> 00:24:10,796
Shawn, we talked about this.
We can't afford a receptionist.

462
00:24:10,797 --> 00:24:13,631
I don't think we can afford
not to have one.

463
00:24:13,632 --> 00:24:15,603
Gus?
What?

464
00:24:15,604 --> 00:24:17,868
I think maybe we should move.

465
00:24:18,109 --> 00:24:20,942
Come on, Gus! Get it in gear!
Go! Go! Go!

466
00:24:28,184 --> 00:24:29,549
Hey! Hey!

467
00:24:35,525 --> 00:24:37,890
Guy's like a Whippet.
Tell me about it.

468
00:24:38,761 --> 00:24:40,819
What's the supersmeller say?

469
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,989
Somebody had
too much to drink.

470
00:24:49,438 --> 00:24:51,996
What are you so happy for?
We almost got killed.

471
00:24:51,997 --> 00:24:53,562
This was not an accident.

472
00:24:53,563 --> 00:24:58,340
Whoever that is was waiting for us and
we have a new suspect for Robert's ghost.

473
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:05,875
He didn't answer his phone.
Maybe he's not home.

474
00:25:07,387 --> 00:25:08,752
Robert?

475
00:25:09,056 --> 00:25:13,924
Or maybe whoever tried to kill us
last night also paid Robert a visit.

476
00:25:13,925 --> 00:25:15,926
And left the door unlocked.

477
00:25:15,927 --> 00:25:17,462
Anybody home?

478
00:25:17,963 --> 00:25:19,692
Robert?
Bob?

479
00:25:22,735 --> 00:25:24,760
Shawn, you might
want to see this.

480
00:25:26,005 --> 00:25:28,495
"Save me. I'm trapped."
Hmm.

481
00:25:28,973 --> 00:25:30,371
I don't want to jump
to conclusions here,

482
00:25:30,372 --> 00:25:32,432
but this very well
may be a cry for help.

483
00:25:32,433 --> 00:25:35,911
Maybe someone died here.
Or was buried alive.

484
00:25:36,281 --> 00:25:37,872
This could be the cry
of a tortured soul.

485
00:25:37,873 --> 00:25:41,509
So this guy just happens to move
into two haunted houses in a row?

486
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:43,285
Don't touch that.
It's blood.

487
00:25:43,286 --> 00:25:44,876
It's not blood.

488
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:46,546
Enjoy your hepatitis.

489
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:50,490
And this tortured soul might be
less tortured with a latex enamel.

490
00:25:50,491 --> 00:25:52,960
He wouldn't get
these messy drips.

491
00:26:09,311 --> 00:26:10,573
Now what?

492
00:26:17,252 --> 00:26:19,650
I got it.
I got it. I got it.

493
00:26:19,651 --> 00:26:21,278
Hallelujah.

494
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,218
Wow.

495
00:26:27,862 --> 00:26:28,954
What?

496
00:26:32,032 --> 00:26:33,794
You got to see this.

497
00:26:39,272 --> 00:26:40,932
Huh.

498
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,268
Not what I was expecting.

499
00:26:44,444 --> 00:26:48,140
Okay, I know what I'm looking
at, but what does it mean?

500
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,009
Is it a ghost?

501
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:58,782
No, buddy, it's not a ghost.

502
00:27:00,024 --> 00:27:01,752
Is there a woman
living up here?

503
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:06,057
Well, that would certainly explain
the perfume Robert's been smelling

504
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:09,030
and all the red hair laying
everywhere, but no, no dice.

505
00:27:09,031 --> 00:27:10,225
Then, what is it?

506
00:27:10,226 --> 00:27:12,359
Oh, come on, Gus. Look.

507
00:27:17,407 --> 00:27:20,136
What?
Robert is a woman.

508
00:27:20,137 --> 00:27:21,609
No, he's not.

509
00:27:22,045 --> 00:27:24,170
Not all the time,
but sometimes.

510
00:27:24,171 --> 00:27:26,213
No. Doesn't seem
like the type.

511
00:27:26,214 --> 00:27:27,680
He's not the type.
Then how?

512
00:27:27,681 --> 00:27:31,310
Unless he has that
personality thing.

513
00:27:31,311 --> 00:27:32,512
What personality thing?

514
00:27:32,513 --> 00:27:34,020
Oh, you know
what I'm talking about.

515
00:27:34,021 --> 00:27:36,487
The multiple
personality disease.

516
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,548
You know, that
what's her name had,

517
00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:40,855
<i>The Flying Nun in the
other thing, the TV movie.</i>

518
00:27:40,856 --> 00:27:42,658
<i>Smokey and the Bandit?</i>

519
00:27:43,131 --> 00:27:45,826
<i>Yeah, dude, Smokey
and the Bandit. Yes.</i>

520
00:27:45,827 --> 00:27:47,526
What does that have to do
with multiple personalities?

521
00:27:47,527 --> 00:27:49,124
You asked.
I asked a real question.

522
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,193
You were supposed to give me a
real answer, not a random guess.

523
00:27:51,194 --> 00:27:53,068
<i>Okay. Fine. Hooper.</i>

524
00:27:53,941 --> 00:27:55,066
<i>Hooper?
Hooper.</i>

525
00:27:55,067 --> 00:27:57,234
<i>Hooper was a stuntman.
Oh.</i>

526
00:27:57,235 --> 00:27:59,710
<i>I don't think Sally Field is even
in Hooper. Who are you thinking of?</i>

527
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:01,041
Oh...

528
00:28:01,042 --> 00:28:02,238
Terry Bradshaw.

529
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:03,714
Yes.

530
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:05,382
<i>Is it Norma Rae?</i>

531
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:07,884
No, but that would have
made that movie a lot cooler.

532
00:28:07,885 --> 00:28:09,818
The thing you asked
about Shawn,

533
00:28:09,819 --> 00:28:12,584
is referred to as
dissociative identity disorder.

534
00:28:12,585 --> 00:28:15,147
That's it! That's what Robert
has, Gus. It all makes sense.

535
00:28:15,148 --> 00:28:16,318
Do you know
how rare that is?

536
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,362
I'm not saying all of Santa Barbara
has it, just Robert. One guy.

537
00:28:19,363 --> 00:28:20,920
I think that qualifies
as pretty rare.

538
00:28:20,921 --> 00:28:22,158
I don't know, Shawn.

539
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,225
These are huge.
Look. Think about it.

540
00:28:25,226 --> 00:28:27,633
There's two separate,
but distinct personalities,

541
00:28:27,634 --> 00:28:29,137
one body.

542
00:28:29,138 --> 00:28:31,640
One's a man,
the other's a woman.

543
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:33,876
The female personality
cooks dinner.

544
00:28:33,877 --> 00:28:36,571
Robert thinks the meals
are the work of a ghost.

545
00:28:36,572 --> 00:28:38,910
The female rearranges
the furniture.

546
00:28:38,911 --> 00:28:42,417
Robert thinks the ghost is moving
things when he's not around.

547
00:28:42,418 --> 00:28:45,453
His old girlfriend did say that he
would disappear for stretches at a time,

548
00:28:45,454 --> 00:28:48,819
which would explain when the
female personality was in control,

549
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,416
Robert would disappear.

550
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:53,388
And he would have
no clue to any of it.

551
00:28:53,389 --> 00:28:58,023
Now, all we need to figure out is how to bring
out the woman so that we can talk to her.

552
00:28:58,024 --> 00:29:01,126
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

553
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:05,198
Triggers.

554
00:29:05,199 --> 00:29:06,739
We shoot him? Then what?

555
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,275
No, no, sights,
sounds, smells.

556
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,907
Something that would trigger
the personality to come out.

557
00:29:11,908 --> 00:29:13,445
Triggers it is.

558
00:29:13,446 --> 00:29:16,108
Gus, this is going to be
kind of cool.

559
00:29:16,384 --> 00:29:17,646
Or weird.

560
00:29:20,854 --> 00:29:22,981
Where did all this stuff
come from?

561
00:29:25,158 --> 00:29:27,991
Is this
where she lives?

562
00:29:28,261 --> 00:29:31,660
The angry female spirit
that you sensed?

563
00:29:31,661 --> 00:29:33,527
Oh, yes.

564
00:29:34,033 --> 00:29:37,594
I feel her very
strongly here, Robert.

565
00:29:38,203 --> 00:29:39,932
Do you?

566
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,974
Do you feel

567
00:29:45,043 --> 00:29:46,169
pretty?

568
00:29:47,512 --> 00:29:48,842
What?

569
00:29:48,843 --> 00:29:50,881
Do you feel pretty?

570
00:29:52,116 --> 00:29:55,279
He means
do you feel a...

571
00:29:55,853 --> 00:29:57,342
female presence?

572
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:01,455
No, but I'm not a psychic.

573
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:05,527
Do you think that you can

574
00:30:09,066 --> 00:30:10,224
Communicate with her?

575
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,233
I'm trying. I am.

576
00:30:15,571 --> 00:30:16,628
Sorry.

577
00:30:16,629 --> 00:30:19,640
Okay. You guys are
starting to creep me out.

578
00:30:19,641 --> 00:30:23,074
So, if I'm not needed, I
think I'll go back downstairs.

579
00:30:23,075 --> 00:30:26,875
Okay. Let me just put this away.
We'll all go down together.

580
00:30:34,723 --> 00:30:36,417
You coming, Shawn?
Yes.

581
00:30:37,391 --> 00:30:39,484
Oh, wow, Robert,

582
00:30:41,061 --> 00:30:43,119
these are some
terrific clothes.

583
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,495
I bet they look absolutely
beautiful on you,

584
00:30:46,496 --> 00:30:48,228
Regina.

585
00:30:49,936 --> 00:30:52,403
Regina? Who...
Who are you talking to?

586
00:30:52,404 --> 00:30:55,167
Yes. Yes, Gus,

587
00:30:55,168 --> 00:30:58,209
why don't you tell Regina

588
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:00,507
how much you like

589
00:31:01,047 --> 00:31:02,877
her nice clothes.

590
00:31:05,017 --> 00:31:06,416
Wow.

591
00:31:08,053 --> 00:31:10,146
Yeah, Regina.

592
00:31:10,856 --> 00:31:12,050
Regina.

593
00:31:12,924 --> 00:31:14,720
You look beautiful.

594
00:31:20,164 --> 00:31:21,323
Regina?

595
00:31:21,324 --> 00:31:22,626
Regina?

596
00:31:26,037 --> 00:31:27,765
Thank you, Gus.

597
00:31:30,073 --> 00:31:34,202
I can't tell you
how glad I am

598
00:31:34,203 --> 00:31:36,541
that you got my message.

599
00:31:37,547 --> 00:31:38,878
So,

600
00:31:39,749 --> 00:31:41,943
do you think that
you can help me?

601
00:31:43,552 --> 00:31:45,281
Please.

602
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,455
Dude.

603
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:54,219
This isn't right.

604
00:32:00,268 --> 00:32:01,632
I must look horrible.

605
00:32:01,633 --> 00:32:03,101
No. Not at all.

606
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,137
You are too kind.

607
00:32:05,138 --> 00:32:08,572
But then again, I already knew
that the way you comforted Robert.

608
00:32:09,609 --> 00:32:11,770
You are so sweet.

609
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,615
Unlike most men,
afraid to show their emotions.

610
00:32:17,616 --> 00:32:19,673
I've been hurt a lot.

611
00:32:19,674 --> 00:32:24,587
Now if you two don't mind,
I really must put on my face.

612
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,984
Wow.

613
00:32:29,528 --> 00:32:31,926
So, Regina, this message
on the wall,

614
00:32:31,927 --> 00:32:34,792
this was your way of trying
to get Robert's attention?

615
00:32:34,793 --> 00:32:36,662
Well, he doesn't even know
I'm alive.

616
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:40,931
Why not write him a letter? Or
an e-mail? Even a post-it even?

617
00:32:40,932 --> 00:32:43,838
I tried. I really did try.

618
00:32:44,108 --> 00:32:47,167
But every time, something
or someone stopped you.

619
00:32:47,168 --> 00:32:49,973
What are you talking about? I
think there's another personality.

620
00:32:49,974 --> 00:32:52,241
Regina, there's another
personality, isn't there?

621
00:32:52,242 --> 00:32:54,476
I mean, you don't smash
pictures or start fires.

622
00:32:54,477 --> 00:32:56,074
You would never
strangle Robert.

623
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:58,016
No, I wouldn't.

624
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:00,714
Regina, the police would
like to speak with you.

625
00:33:00,715 --> 00:33:02,756
They're investigating
Dr. Blinn's murder.

626
00:33:02,757 --> 00:33:05,384
They think you might have seen
something. You could be in danger.

627
00:33:05,385 --> 00:33:07,223
I didn't see anything.

628
00:33:07,224 --> 00:33:09,195
I didn't even go
to my appointment.

629
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:11,629
Why would anyone
want to hurt Dr. Blinn?

630
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:16,433
He was such a nice man and he
was doing so much to help me.

631
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,871
With what?

632
00:33:20,609 --> 00:33:23,599
Well, you ought to know
better than to ask that.

633
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,271
That's between a woman
and her doctor.

634
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,045
Okay.

635
00:33:28,682 --> 00:33:30,945
Unless you're going to ask her
out, I think we're done here.

636
00:33:30,946 --> 00:33:32,246
How do we get Robert back?

637
00:33:32,486 --> 00:33:33,645
I have no idea.

638
00:33:33,646 --> 00:33:35,847
Well, you're her
very special friend.

639
00:33:43,129 --> 00:33:44,255
Regina?

640
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,062
We would like to
speak with Robert.

641
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,159
Can you let Robert
come out and play?

642
00:34:00,012 --> 00:34:01,171
For you,

643
00:34:02,046 --> 00:34:03,512
of course I can.

644
00:34:03,513 --> 00:34:04,773
Thank you.

645
00:34:04,774 --> 00:34:06,976
And I do hope
that we meet again.

646
00:34:08,953 --> 00:34:10,147
Robert.

647
00:34:14,524 --> 00:34:16,048
Robert?

648
00:34:18,094 --> 00:34:19,254
Robert.

649
00:34:19,996 --> 00:34:21,327
Try Bob.

650
00:34:27,036 --> 00:34:28,730
Easy, easy,
easy, easy.

651
00:34:28,731 --> 00:34:33,001
We know it seems weird
and... Actually, it is.

652
00:34:33,002 --> 00:34:34,439
Yeah.
It's really weird.

653
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,102
But we have good news.

654
00:34:37,346 --> 00:34:39,210
We figured out
who your ghost is.

655
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:40,577
Who?

656
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:42,611
You.

657
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:46,610
You're haunting
yourself.

658
00:34:50,024 --> 00:34:53,219
Yep. Life is good.
Life is great.

659
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,692
I mean, Robert gets the help
he so desperately needs,

660
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:59,561
we get to marinate in the delicious
satisfaction of another job well done.

661
00:34:59,562 --> 00:35:03,124
And leading Lassiter to Regina,
even though she saw nothing.

662
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:04,396
That's professional courtesy.

663
00:35:04,397 --> 00:35:06,437
Plus it helps
raise our stock, Gus.

664
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,495
Crime scene photos.

665
00:35:08,496 --> 00:35:10,599
Love crime scene photos.

666
00:35:12,845 --> 00:35:14,437
May I help you?

667
00:35:15,147 --> 00:35:16,613
Detective O'Hara,

668
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,308
what a truly pleasant
surprise. Mmm-hmm.

669
00:35:19,309 --> 00:35:22,615
I just dropped by to tell
Detective Lassiter that I have...

670
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:28,559
We have information regarding the
whereabouts of a one, Regina Kane.

671
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,485
How did you know about it?

672
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:35,791
Never mind. Stay right here.
Don't move. I'll go find him.

673
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:38,092
Ooh.

674
00:35:38,702 --> 00:35:39,862
Shawn.

675
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,330
Shawn, don't do this.

676
00:36:08,397 --> 00:36:10,260
Look at this. Look at this.
Look! Look! Look!

677
00:36:10,261 --> 00:36:12,662
Here, on the floor where poor
Dr. Blinn's body was laying.

678
00:36:12,663 --> 00:36:14,132
A toothpick.

679
00:36:15,636 --> 00:36:17,934
A chewed toothpick.

680
00:36:20,274 --> 00:36:22,331
Yeah? So?
Don't you remember?

681
00:36:22,332 --> 00:36:24,377
The car that tried
to ram us, on the seat?

682
00:36:24,744 --> 00:36:26,735
Chewed toothpick. Oh!

683
00:36:27,213 --> 00:36:29,237
Oh! That means the person
that killed Dr. Blinn

684
00:36:29,238 --> 00:36:31,146
is the same person
that tried to kill us.

685
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,410
It's a chewed
toothpick, Shawn.

686
00:36:32,411 --> 00:36:33,576
Lots of people
chew toothpicks.

687
00:36:33,577 --> 00:36:38,884
Yes, but we were working for Robert. Robert
is also Regina. Regina is a patient of...

688
00:36:38,885 --> 00:36:41,152
Dr. Blinn.
Yes! Take the baton!

689
00:36:41,493 --> 00:36:44,360
So, whoever the killer is
knew both Robert and Regina.

690
00:36:45,097 --> 00:36:49,556
<i>He said his name was, get this,
Martin Brody. How dumb is that?</i>

691
00:36:51,402 --> 00:36:54,394
Oh! Martin Brody.

692
00:36:54,872 --> 00:36:58,238
Of course! That's Robert's other
personality. The violent one.

693
00:36:58,239 --> 00:36:59,741
But, why would he kill
Dr. Blinn?

694
00:36:59,742 --> 00:37:02,506
Depends entirely on what
Regina was seeing him for.

695
00:37:03,914 --> 00:37:05,505
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.

696
00:37:05,506 --> 00:37:06,707
What?

697
00:37:06,708 --> 00:37:09,115
Dr. Blinn's patient files.

698
00:37:10,454 --> 00:37:12,752
All we have to do
is find Regina's.

699
00:37:25,935 --> 00:37:27,458
What are you doing?

700
00:37:27,802 --> 00:37:30,100
Hmm?
What are you doing?

701
00:37:30,805 --> 00:37:33,136
Shooting. It relaxes me.

702
00:37:33,137 --> 00:37:35,607
Shawn Spencer says he has
information for you.

703
00:37:35,608 --> 00:37:37,645
Where is he?
At your desk.

704
00:37:38,646 --> 00:37:40,510
Is anyone watching him?

705
00:37:41,849 --> 00:37:43,373
Found it!

706
00:37:43,951 --> 00:37:45,247
Oh, no.

707
00:37:45,248 --> 00:37:46,581
What?

708
00:37:46,787 --> 00:37:48,584
Gender reassignment?

709
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:52,821
Oh, Regina started feeling like
a woman trapped in a man's body,

710
00:37:52,822 --> 00:37:54,825
so she wants
to have her parts...

711
00:37:54,826 --> 00:37:58,125
Oh, my...
Wait a second.

712
00:37:58,931 --> 00:38:01,057
That means
if Regina was successful,

713
00:38:01,058 --> 00:38:04,159
both Robert and the Martin personality
would also lose their parts.

714
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,294
Martin can't do
anything to hurt Regina

715
00:38:06,295 --> 00:38:07,837
because he would
only be hurting himself.

716
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:10,703
<i>So, dressed as Regina,
he goes after Dr. Blinn.</i>

717
00:38:10,704 --> 00:38:12,902
<i>That would explain how
Robert got the marks on his neck.</i>

718
00:38:12,903 --> 00:38:14,239
<i>And with Dr. Blinn dead,</i>

719
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,212
<i>Robert figured that Regina would change
her mind about the gender reassignment.</i>

720
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:18,406
Right.

721
00:38:18,407 --> 00:38:20,813
We got that, Shawn!

722
00:38:20,814 --> 00:38:22,477
Only she hasn't.

723
00:38:25,656 --> 00:38:29,318
Gus, no, no, she found another
doctor. She's seeing him today.

724
00:38:29,319 --> 00:38:30,586
When?

725
00:38:31,461 --> 00:38:32,791
Right now.

726
00:38:32,792 --> 00:38:34,852
Right now, Shawn?
Like, in 10 minutes.

727
00:38:34,853 --> 00:38:36,296
Oh, okay.

728
00:38:46,975 --> 00:38:48,999
There had better be a really
good explanation for this.

729
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,375
He was in some sort of trance.
I couldn't control him.

730
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:54,479
He says this is the killer.

731
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,849
The killer,
he's going to kill again.

732
00:39:00,154 --> 00:39:01,211
This is ridiculous.

733
00:39:01,212 --> 00:39:02,721
Who? Who's he going to kill?

734
00:39:02,722 --> 00:39:04,087
What is it, Shawn?

735
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,994
Watch out! Watch out!

736
00:39:17,537 --> 00:39:18,594
Oh!

737
00:39:18,595 --> 00:39:20,333
Dr. Drake?

738
00:39:22,675 --> 00:39:25,472
Gender reassignment?
That's a big step, Regina.

739
00:39:25,473 --> 00:39:27,637
Why don't you tell me
why it's important to you?

740
00:39:29,112 --> 00:39:32,446
It's okay. The machine can
get that. This is your time.

741
00:39:34,286 --> 00:39:36,116
Thank you, Dr. Drake.

742
00:39:40,024 --> 00:39:41,719
No answer. Just the machine.

743
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,321
We have to go now.
It could already be too late.

744
00:39:44,562 --> 00:39:45,824
Let's go!

745
00:39:46,898 --> 00:39:49,057
I know this can be
a difficult process,

746
00:39:49,058 --> 00:39:51,531
but it really is necessary
to ensure that you're ready

747
00:39:51,532 --> 00:39:54,297
psychologically
for a change like this.

748
00:39:54,298 --> 00:39:57,101
You do seem like an excellent
candidate for the surgery.

749
00:39:57,774 --> 00:39:59,297
Our time is up.

750
00:39:59,298 --> 00:40:02,469
Why don't we pick up here
again next week? Okay, Regina?

751
00:40:04,647 --> 00:40:06,444
Okey-dokey.

752
00:40:10,219 --> 00:40:11,743
Only

753
00:40:13,588 --> 00:40:16,250
my name is not Regina.

754
00:40:16,725 --> 00:40:18,215
Hold it!

755
00:40:19,761 --> 00:40:21,023
Get up!

756
00:40:23,131 --> 00:40:24,529
- What's going on?
- Robert?

757
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,758
Bob? You back there, buddy?

758
00:40:26,759 --> 00:40:28,631
What am I doing here?

759
00:40:37,845 --> 00:40:39,835
Great. Thanks.

760
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,075
Good news.

761
00:40:43,076 --> 00:40:46,914
They're going to admit Robert into
the HT Windsor Facility in Chicago.

762
00:40:46,915 --> 00:40:49,420
And his doctor thinks
his prognosis is good.

763
00:40:50,223 --> 00:40:52,246
Don't you understand, Shawn?

764
00:40:52,247 --> 00:40:54,883
That's the premier mental
health hospital in the country.

765
00:40:54,884 --> 00:40:57,520
That's good. That's awesome.
Who is that?

766
00:40:58,463 --> 00:40:59,656
Leslie.

767
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:01,027
Oh. Oh. No, no, no, no.

768
00:41:01,028 --> 00:41:02,998
Leslie's supposed to be
a swimsuit model.

769
00:41:02,999 --> 00:41:07,162
Unfortunately, he is. Although, he says
he's getting completely sick of the grind.

770
00:41:07,163 --> 00:41:08,261
I have to call the agency.

771
00:41:08,262 --> 00:41:09,896
They're completely
misrepresenting their clientele.

772
00:41:09,897 --> 00:41:11,304
Leslie's a guy's name, too.

773
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:12,774
Okay.

774
00:41:14,278 --> 00:41:15,335
We have to fire him.

775
00:41:15,336 --> 00:41:17,140
Fire him? On what grounds?

776
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,146
What grounds? On the
grounds that he's a dude.

777
00:41:19,147 --> 00:41:21,512
That's discrimination.
We can't do that.

778
00:41:21,513 --> 00:41:22,881
Okay, listen to me.

779
00:41:22,882 --> 00:41:24,419
No woman is going to
look at us twice

780
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,681
if we're sharing our office
with that ridiculous Adonis.

781
00:41:26,682 --> 00:41:28,450
He's better looking
than both of us put together.

782
00:41:28,451 --> 00:41:29,685
Yeah.

783
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:32,220
I'm not doing that.

784
00:41:32,761 --> 00:41:34,353
But, Gus,

785
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:37,793
you know I can't fire people.
They look too sad.

786
00:41:37,794 --> 00:41:40,266
This was your idea.
Figure it out.

787
00:42:14,433 --> 00:42:18,095
<i>In between the lines
there's a lot of obscurity</i>

788
00:42:18,096 --> 00:42:21,296
<i>I'm not inclined
to resign to maturity</i>

789
00:42:21,297 --> 00:42:24,671
<i>If it's all right
then you're all wrong</i>

00:42:24,672 --> 00:42:28,611
<i>But why bounce around
to the same damn song</i>

791
00:42:29,381 --> 00:42:33,545
<i>You'd rather run
when you can't crawl</i>

792
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:39,015
<i>I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth</i>

793
00:42:39,016 --> 00:42:42,421
<i>I know, you know
They just don't have any proof</i>

794
00:42:42,422 --> 00:42:45,462
<i>Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend</i>

795
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:49,755
<i>Your worst inhibitions tend
to psych you out in the end</i>

796
00:42:49,756 --> 00:42:51,561
<i>I know, you know</i>

797
00:42:53,269 --> 00:42:55,066
<i>I know, you know</i>
