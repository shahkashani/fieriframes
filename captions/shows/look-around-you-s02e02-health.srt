1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,670
You're watching Two.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,351
And now for our weekly look at the
world of science and technology -

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,392
Look Around You.

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,831
On tonight's programme...

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,317
We'll be lifting the lid
on the toilet of the future.

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,320
We'll be looking at what
Pam gets up to while she's asleep.

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,434
And finding out which one of us
will be having plastic surgery

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,437
right here on the programme.

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,554
That's all on tonight's
healthy edition of Look Around You.

10
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,832
♪ Look Around You ♪

11
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,040
Hello, and welcome
to Look Around You.

12
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,871
Tonight's programme is all about the
most important thing in your life,

13
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,798
so important that without it

14
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,719
you wouldn't even be watching
this programme.

15
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,071
I'm talking, of course,
about your health.

16
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,194
Our healths have improved radically
over the past few decades.

17
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,596
In fact, if current trends continue

18
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,079
then by 2010 the average life
expectancy will be 400 years.

19
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,399
With most of us reaching puberty
at around the age of 80.

20
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,239
It's all thanks to advances
in medical science

21
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,114
and British technology
is leading the field

22
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,278
with familiar products
like asthma cigarettes,

23
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,596
the diarrhoea machine,
and, of course,

24
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,712
the controversial Psuicide Spray.

25
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,434
Thanks, Pam(!) But the next big
thing in modern healthcare

26
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,359
comes not from Britain or America,
or even Norway,

27
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,198
but from China.

28
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,439
So please welcome
the future of healthcare, Medibot.

29
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,239
'Medibot!'

30
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,752
Medibot is the only robot in the
world qualified to perform surgery

31
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,031
- and being a robot...
-'Medibot!'

32
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,916
Hello - he can work faster and more
accurately than a human surgeon.

33
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,671
So let's meet the man who works
with Medibot on a daily basis,

34
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,837
Dr Franklin Fu.

35
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,433
- Welcome to Look Around You.
- Hello.

36
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,394
You're going to be giving us
a demonstration of the Medibot.

37
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,673
Yes, I'm going to be performing
plastic surgery on Jack's face.

38
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,157
Now, I'm sure that
our female viewers are thinking,

39
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,318
and probably
one or two male viewers, as well,

40
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,000
how on earth
could you improve on this?

41
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,032
Well, I certainly try.

42
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,799
Through the course of my work

43
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,072
I have studied
hundreds and hundreds of faces,

44
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,591
analysing the proportions
and sizes of features

45
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,634
and it is this information
I will be applying to Jack

46
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,878
as I try to create
the optimum male face.

47
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,231
So Jack should end up
with perfect looks?

48
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,556
Well, I hope so.

49
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,399
And Dr Fu will be
assisted by Medibot...

50
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,000
-'Medibot!'
- Oh, I think he likes me.

51
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,397
- (Laughter)
- You better move round there, Jack.

52
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,640
Now, Doctor, Medibot is clearly
a pretty serious piece of kit.

53
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,911
Presumably he's quite expensive?

54
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,158
Oh, yes. Medibot is very expensive.

55
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,752
In fact, there are only
four Medibots in the world.

56
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,079
This one here and the other three
belong to Tony Curtis.

57
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,438
So just how good is the Medibot?
Is he as good as a human surgeon?

58
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,279
(Dr Fu) Oh, I'd say better.
He's so versatile.

59
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,837
He can do anything,
from complex surgery to, er...

60
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,156
taking a urine sample.

61
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,274
I won't keep you any longer.
Best of luck with the operation.

62
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,879
'Medibot!'

63
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,711
We'll be following Jack's progress
throughout the rest of the show.

64
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,917
Over the past few months

65
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,910
our newspapers have been filled with
horrifying accounts of a new disease

66
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,192
that has been spreading
at an alarming rate.

67
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,314
It's a disease for which
at present there is no known cure.

68
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,511
And it's all the more terrifying

69
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,873
because scientists don't even know
what causes the disease.

70
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:05,517
I'm talking, of course,
about geodermic granititis,

71
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,280
more commonly known as Cobbles.

72
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,312
(♪ Sad music)

73
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,434
Cobbles is a wicked disease
that strikes indiscriminately,

74
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,790
attacking
the central nervous system,

75
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,799
fooling it into calcifying
bodily tissue,

76
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,710
eventually turning the victim into
what is essentially a pile of rocks.

77
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,394
Cobbles sufferers try to lead
as normal a life as possible

78
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,238
but it's hard.

79
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,078
Extreme mental anguish,

80
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,353
coupled with almost insurmountable
physical difficulties

81
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,835
can make life intolerable.

82
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,437
But now there may be
a light at the end of the tunnel

83
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,600
because a British doctor claims to
have made an important breakthrough.

84
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,714
And he joins us in the studio now -
Dr Phillip Lavender.

85
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,280
Doctor, thank you
for coming on the show.

86
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,755
Thank you for having me on the show.

87
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,510
Now, you're a sufferer from
the condition yourself, aren't you?

88
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,758
- I am, Pam, yes.
- How long have you had Cobbles?

89
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,520
Just over two years now.

90
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,439
But you've been very busy,
haven't you?

91
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,392
I've spent most of that time

92
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,274
trying to find a cure
with my research team.

93
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,711
- And you're going to show us it?
- Certainly.

94
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,796
Now, Doctor, what exactly is it?

95
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,992
We've produced what is
essentially a body cream

96
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,477
which rejuvenates dormant tissue
and skin cells

97
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,434
and aims to reverse
the damaging effects of Cobbles.

98
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,915
I see. And what does it contain?

99
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,715
Well, cream, potassium, nitrates,
potassium nitrates

100
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,753
- and nitrate of potassiate nitrate.
- OK.

101
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,554
We're going to demonstrate
how it works.

102
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,072
That's right, Pam. So if you take
a small amount with your fingers.

103
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,315
- OK.
- OK.

104
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,795
And just start applying that to me.

105
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,877
OK, where shall I put it?

106
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,071
- Er, no, not there.
- Oh, sorry.

107
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,112
Try higher up.

108
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,514
- Not in my mouth!
- I'm so sorry.

109
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,439
Let me just... Whoops.
Sorry, I'll just...

110
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,757
Right. Erm...

111
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,838
- So how about...there?
- Yeah, that's OK.

112
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,430
And so you can see
the cream is now working its way

113
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,154
slowly through my semi-porous rock.

114
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,352
Right. Now, just before
the programme started

115
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,711
we applied some cream to a small
area of Dr Lavender's body

116
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,831
so that we could see its effect.

117
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,111
That's right, Pam,
and if we just look,

118
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,039
it's just round here, by my bottom.

119
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,232
- (Pam) That is remarkable.
- (Dr Lavender chuckles)

120
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,954
We want to do this
for the entire body

121
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,870
but at the moment the cream only
lasts for about 15 minutes

122
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,391
before the skin
starts to become rock again,

123
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,000
so this is something
we need to work on.

124
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:11,399
Well, Doctor, we all hope you find a
cure for your terrible affliction.

125
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,036
Well, it's not all bad.
At least we can fly. Goodbye.

126
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,190
Well, I'm now in the special
operating area of the studio

127
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,836
with Dr Fu and Medibot,
the robotic surgeon.

128
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,193
Medibot's just about to perform
plastic surgery on Jack's face

129
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,357
under the supervision of Dr Fu here.

130
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,790
Doctor, what's happening now?

131
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,198
At the moment I'm in the final
stages of the preparation,

132
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,200
and, er, I'm about
to load Medibot up with

133
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,314
a very special
plastic surgery computer program.

134
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,999
So, Doctor, tell us,
how will Medibot be working tonight?

135
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,831
- (Computer program loading)
- Medibot will use a powerful laser

136
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,715
to carry out most of the remodelling
of Jack's features.

137
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,956
- I see.
- Medibot?

138
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,959
-'Medibot!'
- Please configure laser settings.

139
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,111
And how's our patient doing?

140
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,994
- I could do with a pint.
- Medibot?

141
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,680
-'Medibot!'
- Prepare the anaesthetic.

142
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,358
Doctor, may I ask, what is it you
keep putting into Medibot's mouth?

143
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,189
Oh, these are just hundreds
and thousands, he loves them.

144
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,311
'Medibot!'

145
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,800
OK, I think Jack
is ready to go under now

146
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,959
so if you would all like to say
goodbye - I mean, good night.

147
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,992
(Laughs) Just joking.

148
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,158
- Well, best of luck, old chap.
- Thanks, Pete.

149
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,272
- Nice knowing you, Jack.
- Thanks, Pealy(!)

150
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,960
- You look after our boy.
- Of course.

151
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,755
- Hope you're all right, Jack.
- I'll be fine. Bye-bye. Bye.

152
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,154
Bye-bye.

153
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,080
So, Jack, if you would like
to lie very still.

154
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,351
Very, very still. Thank you.

155
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,032
- Medibot!
-'Medibot!'

156
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,879
Administer the anaesthetic, please.

157
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,113
Well, sweet dreams, Jack,

158
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,790
and we'll be checking back on him
throughout the programme.

159
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,791
First you sense it -
feel it inside -

160
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,719
then you realise,
he's looking at you.

161
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,400
Go on, look at him.

162
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,114
Now he's waving at you -
he likes you.

163
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,955
Go on, smile at him. Smile.

164
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,311
But you can't
because of your disgusting teeth.

165
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,234
But now there's no need
to be ashamed of your smile.

166
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,990
Brush with Jenny
and you'll soon see the difference.

167
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,317
Jenny is gentle, mild
and kind to your teeth.

168
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,591
Now, ready for that smile?

169
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,352
Say goodbye to disgusting teeth
with Jenny, the mild toothpaste.

170
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,596
And now, new Lenny for men.

171
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,994
These days we're bombarded
with adverts for new toothpaste,

172
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,236
mouthwash or dental loaf.

173
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,989
In the last year a staggering
50 new brands of toothpaste

174
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,919
have been launched
in Great Britain alone.

175
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,839
But do these products
really do anything?

176
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,032
Well, new research has shown
that most of these

177
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,677
are no better than brushing with
good old-fashioned soap and water.

178
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,316
So it might be worth
investing in one of these -

179
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,273
an electric toothbrush
with a difference.

180
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,031
If you look at its head you'll see
that it doesn't have any bristles.

181
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,279
Well, because this toothbrush
doesn't use toothpaste

182
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,233
to clean your teeth but electricity.

183
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,160
The powerful electric current
not only burns away plaque

184
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,271
but it hardens the tooth enamel

185
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,360
making your teeth
up to 120 times stronger.

186
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,711
So let's put it to
the Look Around You test.

187
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,991
OK, then, Peter. Plug me in.

188
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,269
OK.

189
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,037
- OK?
- Yeah.

190
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,278
- Oh, I think you switched it off.
- Oh.

191
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,630
- (Electrical hum)
- And off we go.

192
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,039
Cleaning your teeth like this
is actually quite painful

193
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,596
but who cares when it leaves
your teeth strong enough

194
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,438
to be able to do this?

195
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,349
However, there is one side effect.

196
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,835
(Quickly) Because the current also
passes through your vocal cords

197
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,600
it can affect your speech patterns
so it won't be in the shops yet.

198
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,710
But we'll keep you posted.

199
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,110
- You still hungry, Pealy?
- Mm, I might finish the rest now.

200
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,952
- Medibot.
-'Medibot!'

201
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,754
Increase intensity by 2.4 per cent.

202
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,432
As you can see, Jack's plastic
surgery operation is in full swing.

203
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,751
- Medibot.
-'Medibot!'

204
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,760
Make an incision into the cartilage
just above the bridge.

205
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,793
Doctor, sorry to disturb you
but can you tell me,

206
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,832
how's the operation going?

207
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,191
Pretty good.
At the moment we are stripping away

208
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,994
the extraneous tissue
from Jack's face,

209
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,080
so hopefully we will be on course
to finishing in time.

210
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,112
And how's your assistant?

211
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,279
Oh, Medibot? He's doing a great job.
Aren't you, Medibot?

212
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,720
'Medibot!'

213
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,551
Now, I've heard that this Medibot
has a special, secret talent.

214
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,995
Oh, yes, er... Erm, I found out
that he can play the mouth organ.

215
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,953
- Really?
- Yes. Listen to this.

216
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,713
- (Plays random notes)
- That's great.

217
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,913
No, er, sorry, it's the wrong
way round. Here we go.

218
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,917
(♪ Chirpy tune)

219
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,475
(Laughing)

220
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,910
He's so... He gets me all the time.

221
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:06,237
Of legend told, brave lady of old
would sleep all night and day

222
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:13,510
With rump so soft and, oh, so oft
upon bed of feather and hay

223
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,192
So lady brave to you I say,
have a lovely sleep, my darling.

224
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,631
Have a lovely, lovely sleep...

225
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,113
my darling.

226
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,958
Sleep well.

227
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,720
- Good night.
- (Alarm clock ringing)

228
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,438
(Ringing stops)

229
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,792
Ah, 40 winks - sheer bliss.

230
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,357
You know, we spend almost
30 per cent of our lives asleep

231
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,677
yet we only know about 20 per cent
of what is happening to us

232
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,120
during this state.

233
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,040
In fact, scientists
are only about 10 per cent sure

234
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,276
as to why humans sleep at all.

235
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,200
So what does go on
when the lights go out?

236
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,789
Here at the National Sleep Research
Centre in St St Johnn's,

237
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,230
some fascinating studies
are being done

238
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,273
to try and solve
some of the mysteries of sleep.

239
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,960
Professor Keith Craven
is the Institute's director.

240
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,995
The Centre's been running
for about 140 years now.

241
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,954
It began life under the patronage
of Queen Victoria

242
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,676
but of course in those days
it wasn't a sleep institute

243
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,680
it was a sanctuary
for elephants and butterflies.

244
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,033
(Pam) At any one time there are
up to 20 full-time volunteers

245
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,960
who allow their sleeping behaviour
and even their dreams

246
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,438
to be monitored and analysed
by Professor Craven's research team.

247
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,711
One of the patients, Michael,

248
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,434
is wired up to a machine
called a Somnascope

249
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,872
which allows scientists to actually
watch dreams as they happen.

250
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,038
This is an intriguing piece
of equipment.

251
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,357
Can you tell us about
what we're looking at here?

252
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,392
Certainly, Pam.

253
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,274
This is one of
Michael's recurring dreams,

254
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,040
we call it the Montgomery Dream.

255
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:23,678
In it he sees himself as the
character of Montgomery the butler.

256
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,600
Er, Montgomery is about to
serve breakfast to his master

257
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,190
but suddenly has an urge
to eat all the jam.

258
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,235
And in a moment the mistress
of the house is going to come in -

259
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:41,719
there she is - and she gives him
a jolly good telling off.

260
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,356
Put that jam down at once!
It's the master's.

261
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,392
You know what this means?

262
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,511
- (Chuckles)
- You little turd!

263
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,871
Professor, what can we learn
from watching dreams?

264
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,516
Well, their hopes, their fears,

265
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,678
their sexual desires,

266
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,360
their worries, er...

267
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,996
Things that might not be apparent
on the surface.

268
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,238
Stop eating that jam,
you little shit!

269
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,832
(Pam) Professor Craven has an
extensive library of people's dreams

270
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,917
all captured on video cassette.

271
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,237
So, Professor,
what are we going to look at now?

272
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,160
Well, Pam, you're privileged,
if I may say so myself,

273
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,874
to watch one of my own dreams.

274
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,877
- Oh, thank you.
- Yes.

275
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:33,518
We were particularly happy with it
because it's a very clear recording.

276
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,631
OK, well let's take a look at it.

277
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,952
(♪ Gentle piano)

278
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,998
Craven! Craven?! Chapter nine!

279
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,793
Read!

280
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,150
(Gibbers)

281
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,351
What's the matter with you,
you filthy fool?

282
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,154
Idiot! Pidiot! Pridiot!

283
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:14,231
Peroxamidiot!
Cabbage hall idiot investment bond!

284
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,749
(Sobbing)

285
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,713
(Baby crying, echoing)

286
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,156
Where's my pipe?

287
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,114
You're an embarrassment, boy!
You've embarrassed the pipe!

288
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,231
(Craven moaning)

289
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,069
- Hello.
- (Distorted voice) Hello!

290
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,077
Do you like my perfume?

291
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:59,275
- (Craven) Mmm.
- (Woman moans in ecstasy)

292
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,789
(Both moaning)

293
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,316
I had that one last night.

294
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,592
Hola? Flamingo.

295
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:18,669
(Pam) Our unconscious minds
are actually extremely active

296
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,634
and Professor Craven's team
have been developing new ways

297
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,310
of harnessing the brain's powers
while we're asleep.

298
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:33,311
Well, you've seen just a fraction
of some of the work we're doing

299
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,317
here at the Institute.

300
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,717
And perhaps you might like
to be a volunteer

301
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,752
in one of our latest projects?

302
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,269
Of course,
but what would it involve?

303
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,958
It would involve driving
this motor car

304
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,992
at high speed around the test track.

305
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,829
- That looks like fun.
- But you will be fast asleep.

306
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,918
Hm, I might have known
there had to be a catch.

307
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,236
I'd better get on with my training

308
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,559
but I'm beginning to wish I'd never
got out of bed this morning.

309
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,071
(Quickly) You can see how Pam got on
at the end of the programme.

310
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,160
But now let's see
how Jack's plastic surgery is going.

311
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,511
- Doctor, what's happening?
- We're at the end now.

312
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,552
Just finishing off.

313
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,354
That was quick.
And how's the patient?

314
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,915
You can ask him yourself,
he's awake.

315
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,633
Jack?

316
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,672
- Mm?
- How are you feeling?

317
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,476
My face feels a bit numb
but I'm all right, thanks, Pam.

318
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,993
Well, why don't we, er...er, clean
him up so we can all take a look?

319
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,599
I can't wait.

320
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,394
Medibot,
give me some tissues, please.

321
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,079
'Medibot!'

322
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,394
'Medibot!'

323
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,431
While Jack's getting cleaned up,

324
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,552
let's remind ourselves
of what he used to look like

325
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,638
with this special report
from Loorizons,

326
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,071
the toilet industry's
annual exhibition in Bath.

327
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,032
(♪ Bleeping electronica)

328
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,078
(Jack) To the germs in your home
your toilet is like Las Vegas.

329
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,194
If you think about it,
when you use the toilet

330
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,517
you're leaving a meal
for millions of hungry germs

331
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,552
and that's not a nice thought.

332
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,550
There are dozens of products
on the market these days,

333
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,751
all promising to destroy germs,

334
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,874
from the bleach pill
to the toilet tarvunty.

335
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,879
But none of them
are 100 per cent effective.

336
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:41,392
But now there's a new British
invention which may be the answer

337
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,113
and here it is.

338
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,720
It's called the Sani-sac
and as you can see

339
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,071
it takes its inspiration
from the good old tea bag.

340
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,160
However, inside is not tea
but coffee.

341
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,717
Coffee has been used for centuries
as a powerful sterilising agent

342
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,480
which is why
most men normally drink tea.

343
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,240
So let's see the Sani-sac in action.

344
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,830
You just pop your Sani-sac
into the top of your cistern,

345
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,712
very simple, there it is.

346
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,032
Give your loo a good flush...

347
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:23,230
and now your toilet's so clean
you can even drink out of it.

348
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,234
Ahh.

349
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,360
(Quickly) The final of our Look
Around You Invention of the Year

350
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,280
is at the end of the series
and one winner will win this trophy

351
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,755
presented by His Royal Highness
Sir Prince Charles.

352
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,792
So that's certainly something
to look forward to.

353
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:55,952
And in honour of his remarkable
achievement against such adversity

354
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,640
the invention
we're putting forward this week

355
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,469
is the anti-cobbling cream,
created by Dr Phillip Lavender.

356
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,150
- (Lavender) Hello again.
- Congratulations, Doctor.

357
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,113
- Thank you very much indeed.
- And here's your rosette.

358
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,517
Ah, thank you, Pealy.
Ooh. (Chuckles)

359
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,678
And what a very quick voice
you've got. Goodbye.

360
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,552
Now it's the moment
we've all been waiting for

361
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,435
because it's time to unveil
Jack Morgan's brand-new face.

362
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,437
Doctor, how do you think
you've done?

363
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,631
Er, pretty good, Pete.

364
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,559
I think me and Medibot
have done a good job.

365
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,557
Don't you think, Medibot?

366
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,080
'Medibot!'

367
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,840
Let's remind ourselves
of what Jack looked like

368
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,315
before he went under the laser.

369
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,355
There he is.

370
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,110
So, Doctor, if you'd like to get
ready to do the honours.

371
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,870
- (Drum roll)
- (Jack) I hope he hasn't ruined me.

372
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:01,439
So let's all now take a look
at the brand-new Jack Morgan!

373
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,599
Well?

374
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,632
I love it.

375
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,356
I love it. I love it!

376
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,916
Jack, it's amazing.
You're absolutely gorgeous.

377
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,111
(Jack) Thanks, Pealy. I love it!

378
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,629
- I love it.
- Jack, you look amazing.

379
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,672
Doctor, I love it. I love it.

380
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,111
- Don't thank me, thank Medibot.
- Thanks, Medibot.

381
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,720
Give him some
hundreds and thousands.

382
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,719
- There we are. Good boy.
-'Medibot!'

383
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,558
What really sets it off is the tusk.

384
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,798
Unbelievable. I really love it.

385
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,471
Well, you've got to have it changed
back before next week's show.

386
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,557
Oh! But I love it.

387
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,160
That's all we've got
time for tonight.

388
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,590
Thank you to all our guests
for taking part -

389
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,519

393

We'll be back at the same time
next week
