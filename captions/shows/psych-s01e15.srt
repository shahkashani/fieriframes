1
00:00:18,717 --> 00:00:20,240
This is torture.

2
00:00:20,241 --> 00:00:23,287
It's not torture, Shawn, it's a 10
minute ride to the police station.

3
00:00:23,288 --> 00:00:24,514
But I wanna eat my candy.

4
00:00:24,515 --> 00:00:27,683
Not until I
have it X-Rayed.

5
00:00:27,684 --> 00:00:29,385
Well, can I eat my candy?

6
00:00:29,386 --> 00:00:31,223
Knock yourself out, Lando.

7
00:00:31,224 --> 00:00:35,323
As long as your old man doesn't mind his
nine year-old son passing razor blades.

8
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:47,305
Officer, please!
We've got a jumper.

9
00:00:47,306 --> 00:00:49,404
Hey, hey, back off,
I got kids in here.

10
00:00:49,405 --> 00:00:51,176
Phone lines are down,
we tried the police already.

11
00:00:51,177 --> 00:00:52,478
There's no time.
She's really gonna jump.

12
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:54,314
Okay, okay, look, look,
I'll radio for backup.

13
00:00:54,315 --> 00:00:55,410
I not gonna subject
these boys to...

14
00:00:55,411 --> 00:00:57,353
Dad, you have to help.

15
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,821
Sonofa...

16
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:13,563
Now listen to me boys,

17
00:01:13,564 --> 00:01:16,234
I do not want you to leave
this vehicle. Do you understand?

18
00:01:16,235 --> 00:01:18,243
I want you to stay put
until I get back.

19
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:22,510
Don't look, don't listen.
Just shut your eyes.

20
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,715
And keep them shut.
I'll be right back.

21
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:34,358
<i>She's straight up the stairs.
Room 413!</i>

22
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:38,356
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

23
00:01:38,357 --> 00:01:39,729
Not even sort of.

24
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,503
Gus...
You'll thank me later.

25
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,478
<i>Doreen!</i>

26
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:37,799
<i>Doreen.</i>

27
00:02:51,161 --> 00:02:53,265
<i>Doreen!</i>

28
00:03:11,895 --> 00:03:15,386
<i>I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth</i>

29
00:03:15,387 --> 00:03:18,922
<i>I know, you know
They just don't have any proof</i>

30
00:03:18,923 --> 00:03:21,799
<i>Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend</i>

31
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,070
<i>Your worst inhibitions tend
to psych you out in the end</i>

32
00:03:36,253 --> 00:03:37,651
You cheated.
I did not cheat.

33
00:03:37,652 --> 00:03:39,119
You're not using
the side walls at all.

34
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,918
I don't need your tips, Shawn.
I've beaten you before.

35
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:42,652
Yeah. When we were 12.
And I had pinkeye.

36
00:03:42,653 --> 00:03:45,661
Immaterial. The low game was crackling.
The worm burner was in full effect.

37
00:03:45,662 --> 00:03:47,959
Okay, you cannot have a shot
called the worm burner. Why not?

38
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,297
Because it's my strikeout pitch in
Wiffle ball. Pick a different name.

39
00:03:59,077 --> 00:04:01,477
Excuse us,
may we help you?

40
00:04:02,447 --> 00:04:04,311
Hey, guys.
Damn, girl.

41
00:04:04,312 --> 00:04:07,681
Yeah, I know. Get it all out
now. I barely recognize myself.

42
00:04:11,322 --> 00:04:13,517
But isn't it kind of amazing?

43
00:04:16,895 --> 00:04:18,327
Mary Lou Baumgartner.

44
00:04:18,328 --> 00:04:23,230
National Alumni Vice Parliamentarian.
Beta Kappa Theta Sorority.

45
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:26,032
Guys. I'm undercover. Deep.

46
00:04:28,774 --> 00:04:30,502
We should totally celebrate.

47
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:33,806
It's crazy. I have spent the
entire morning planning a mixer!

48
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:37,336
And yesterday, I went and I
had a Himalayan mani-pedi.

49
00:04:37,337 --> 00:04:39,076
Yeah, at first it was just to
get the other girls to talk,

50
00:04:39,077 --> 00:04:42,210
but then I realized my cuticles have
been completely taken for granted.

51
00:04:42,211 --> 00:04:48,587
Jules, you realize that we are the
only ones that can see or hear you.

52
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,923
Yeah, okay, I admit.

53
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:54,591
I've been undercover a week now, and it's
really hard to get out of this mindset.

54
00:04:54,592 --> 00:04:56,759
These girls, they are demons.

55
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:02,430
They are vicious little prairie dogs
with trust funds and collagen parties.

56
00:05:02,431 --> 00:05:04,874
It's a lot to juggle
and I need a favor.

57
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,877
Okay.

58
00:05:06,878 --> 00:05:10,813
I've been at the university investigating
the death of a coed, Doreen Harthan.

59
00:05:10,814 --> 00:05:13,374
The girl they found
at Wispy Sunny Pines.

60
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,578
Wasn't that a suicide?

61
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:16,484
Allegedly. A copycat job.

62
00:05:16,485 --> 00:05:19,557
I guess Santa Barbara has some
sort of urban legend

63
00:05:19,558 --> 00:05:22,788
<i>about a mental patient who
jumped from room 413.</i>

64
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,193
Scary Sherry.
We know that one.

65
00:05:25,194 --> 00:05:27,925
Yeah, well, I'm not so sure
about the suicide angle

66
00:05:27,926 --> 00:05:30,561
and Interim Chief Vick is putting
a tremendous amount of faith in me

67
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:33,698
to crack this thing
and I need to build a case.

68
00:05:34,942 --> 00:05:36,738
So I'm here,
but I'm not. Get it?

69
00:05:36,739 --> 00:05:37,936
Gus, what's the word?

70
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,377
That'd be mum.

71
00:05:41,015 --> 00:05:42,777
Doreen was pledging
a sorority.

72
00:05:42,778 --> 00:05:48,149
And I, or, Mary Lou, am helping my
sisters through this very difficult time.

73
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,280
I'm convinced they know more
than they're letting on.

74
00:05:50,281 --> 00:05:52,984
I need a psychic to read the sorority
house. Can you come by tonight?

75
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:54,559
Can we wear pajamas?
No.

76
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,821
Even better.

77
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,523
Guys, this is serious, there's some
really weird stuff that's been going on.

78
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,862
The girls are petrified, they
think they're being haunted.

79
00:06:00,863 --> 00:06:02,492
By what?

80
00:06:02,493 --> 00:06:05,904
Oh, come on, Jules. You know we're
gonna come man up. Just tell us.

81
00:06:07,309 --> 00:06:10,436
Doreen Harthan's
lumbering ghost.

82
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:12,035
Lumbering?

83
00:06:12,036 --> 00:06:13,841
Seems completely
logical to me.

84
00:06:13,842 --> 00:06:16,280
Meet me at the house at 7:00.

85
00:06:16,281 --> 00:06:19,376
And remember,
I was never here.

86
00:06:19,377 --> 00:06:23,150
Quick question. Where's
Lassiter for all of this?

87
00:06:23,151 --> 00:06:25,591
Temporary re-assignment.
Bye.

88
00:06:27,863 --> 00:06:31,423
Excuse me, I'm gonna have to
ask you to vacate this room.

89
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:35,265
Excuse me, I'm gonna have to
ask you to go screw yourself.

90
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:36,360
I beg your pardon?

91
00:06:36,361 --> 00:06:37,632
Oh, don't beg.

92
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,308
Look, there's gonna be a private
meeting in this room between myself

93
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:43,867
and a new detective
from a new department.

94
00:06:43,868 --> 00:06:45,846
Well, then I must be
in the right place.

95
00:06:46,148 --> 00:06:48,809
No, Ma'am,
I'm looking for a rookie.

96
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,215
What the hell does that mean?

97
00:06:50,216 --> 00:06:55,154
You know, bright-eyed, bushy-tailed,
roots matching the rest of the hair.

98
00:06:55,155 --> 00:06:58,124
I'm a detective. Goochberg.

99
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,457
Gooch to people I respect.

100
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:03,522
And those few lucky enough
to have seen me naked.

101
00:07:05,701 --> 00:07:07,930
Guess which one
you should use?

102
00:07:07,931 --> 00:07:10,438
God, the first one?

103
00:07:11,073 --> 00:07:16,409
I'm sorry, how can you possibly be a
rookie at your, you know, advanced age?

104
00:07:17,213 --> 00:07:20,307
I passed the test Friday.

105
00:07:20,308 --> 00:07:22,978
I had to sue the department
to let me take it again.

106
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,980
Again?

107
00:07:25,856 --> 00:07:29,553
I might have failed it. A few
times. Thirteen to be exact.

108
00:07:30,327 --> 00:07:33,784
But that's the first thing you're
gonna learn about me, scarecrow,

109
00:07:33,785 --> 00:07:36,924
the word "quit"
is not in my vocabulary.

110
00:07:38,869 --> 00:07:41,394
Where do you go to
shoot guns around here?

111
00:07:55,687 --> 00:07:59,350
I see a man.
He's driving your car.

112
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:03,492
You don't know him.
He's a valet.

113
00:08:05,096 --> 00:08:10,830
And a mall. Wait, I see a shoe
store. Your father's gold card.

114
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:14,435
A Jamba Juice
may have been involved?

115
00:08:14,436 --> 00:08:17,803
Oh, my God.
I totally went shopping today.

116
00:08:17,804 --> 00:08:20,605
I passed by
a Jamba on State Street.

117
00:08:22,046 --> 00:08:23,478
You are amazing.

118
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:25,640
See, Bianca?

119
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:30,119
Now tell Shawn what
happened to you last night.

120
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,783
Okay, here goes.

121
00:08:33,784 --> 00:08:36,986
This is so scary.

122
00:08:37,396 --> 00:08:41,263
<i>I was lying in bed, watching
One Tree Hill, my favorite show,</i>

123
00:08:41,264 --> 00:08:43,732
Chad Michael Murray
is so hot.

124
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:47,498
And I have this cute liquid
kitty alarm clock, right?

125
00:08:47,499 --> 00:08:51,906
It meows and it blinks
its eyes every half hour.

126
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:56,106
So, all of a sudden,
they just started

127
00:08:56,107 --> 00:09:00,344
blinking over and
over and over

128
00:09:00,345 --> 00:09:03,215
and then it
just stopped.

129
00:09:03,216 --> 00:09:07,053
And then, it let out
this half-meow.

130
00:09:10,397 --> 00:09:12,557
And then its tail fell off.

131
00:09:12,558 --> 00:09:15,897
Then it exploded.

132
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,560
Wow.

133
00:09:20,306 --> 00:09:24,241
Slow build.
Half meow, unexpected.

134
00:09:24,242 --> 00:09:26,140
Didn't see the end
coming at all.

135
00:09:26,141 --> 00:09:27,269
How about you, Gus?

136
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,405
What?

137
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:31,814
No, I can't say I did.

138
00:09:33,787 --> 00:09:34,879
Anybody else?

139
00:09:40,694 --> 00:09:47,533
Okay, so basically it's a lot of really weird
stuff that's creepy and happens at night.

140
00:09:48,335 --> 00:09:50,996
Mr. Spencer is it?

141
00:09:50,997 --> 00:09:53,199
Yes, that's correct Mrs...

142
00:10:06,053 --> 00:10:07,110
Baumgartner.

143
00:10:07,111 --> 00:10:09,951
Now, what I'm going to need from
you, is an article of clothing.

144
00:10:09,952 --> 00:10:11,786
Preferably an undergarment.

145
00:10:11,787 --> 00:10:14,088
Don't you usually
get that from the victim?

146
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:15,627
I've seen it both ways.

147
00:10:15,628 --> 00:10:20,097
I'm gonna have to take a look
around to see what I feel.

148
00:10:20,868 --> 00:10:22,802
Starting with the bedrooms.

149
00:10:22,803 --> 00:10:24,132
Of course.

150
00:10:24,133 --> 00:10:26,003
I'll show you upstairs.

151
00:10:27,676 --> 00:10:28,802
Ask him.

152
00:10:29,411 --> 00:10:31,401
You ask him.

153
00:10:31,402 --> 00:10:33,276
What? What do you
wanna ask me, girls?

154
00:10:33,277 --> 00:10:36,613
Don't be nervous. I put my pants
on one leg at a time, just like you.

155
00:10:37,886 --> 00:10:41,788
<i>Okay. Did you really play
Bud on The Cosby Show?</i>

156
00:10:42,624 --> 00:10:44,648
Bud? Who told you that?

157
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:46,990
I knew I recognized you!

158
00:10:48,163 --> 00:10:49,459
Wait, wait I'm not...

159
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,122
Oh, come-on,
don't be modest, Gus.

160
00:10:51,123 --> 00:10:52,894
You are totally Bud!

161
00:10:53,535 --> 00:10:55,866
Shawn, you believe this?

162
00:10:55,867 --> 00:10:59,634
No, no, no,
I didn't catch anything, Bud.

163
00:10:59,635 --> 00:11:01,370
Stop telling people
that my name is Bud.

164
00:11:02,706 --> 00:11:05,475
<i>Get out!</i>

165
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:20,256
<i>Ackenaib! Ackenaib!
Ackenaib!</i>

166
00:11:58,035 --> 00:12:01,163
Shawn!
Where are you going!

167
00:12:06,543 --> 00:12:10,138
My partner and I just need to confer
in private. Compare notes and what not.

168
00:12:27,031 --> 00:12:31,525
Okay. The girls are sleeping
over at the Omega Muse.

169
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,499
Well, they can come home tomorrow, I
found the evil spirit, it's Radio Shack.

170
00:12:35,707 --> 00:12:38,800
The face at the window, the old
flood light on the roof trick.

171
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:41,344
That's how they do it at Haunted
Mansion. Don't ask me how I know that.

172
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:45,041
These girls are awful. The suspect list
is essentially the entire student registry.

173
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,375
Although...
Although what?

174
00:12:47,376 --> 00:12:48,714
Alice Bundy.

175
00:12:48,715 --> 00:12:50,515
Doreen's best friend,
her roommate.

176
00:12:50,516 --> 00:12:51,850
Thought you said
she lived at home.

177
00:12:51,851 --> 00:12:54,118
The Harthan's
took Alice in.

178
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:57,593
She's the only one that I haven't talked
to, but conventional wisdom would say,

179
00:12:57,594 --> 00:12:59,653
she has a score to settle.

180
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,461
Holy Shitzu!

181
00:13:02,001 --> 00:13:05,869
Excuse me? This new polish
is already starting to chip!

182
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:22,643
You know, you might actually
hit the target more

183
00:13:22,644 --> 00:13:24,689
if you bothered to blink
in between rounds.

184
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,281
And of course your concentration
level might get a little boost

185
00:13:26,282 --> 00:13:29,385
if you bothered to wear
protective ear and eyewear.

186
00:13:29,863 --> 00:13:33,059
That wouldn't do any good,
I'm totally deaf in this ear.

187
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,032
It was in a bar room fight
with a teamster.

188
00:13:35,033 --> 00:13:37,091
She had a waffle iron. But
see, that's not the problem.

189
00:13:37,092 --> 00:13:38,261
The problem is
this pea-shooter.

190
00:13:38,262 --> 00:13:40,430
This pea-shooter they
issued me. I need a real gun.

191
00:13:40,431 --> 00:13:42,872
I need something like
this. Let me see this. No!

192
00:13:42,873 --> 00:13:44,910
Oh, see now, this is a gun.

193
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:47,571
No, you see, that's an
enormously powerful handgun.

194
00:13:47,572 --> 00:13:49,614
You're not bracing
yourself for the kickback.

195
00:13:49,615 --> 00:13:51,514
Don't tell me
my business, kid.

196
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:07,564
Trust me, you won't
even recognize yourself.

197
00:14:07,565 --> 00:14:09,795
Which is a
really good thing.

198
00:14:09,796 --> 00:14:13,839
It will be fun, and you can help
save the endangered tamarind monkeys.

199
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:29,151
Bianca, you have like twice as
many flyers as me and Mary Lou.

200
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:33,157
What's going on with you? Are
you like pregnant or something?

201
00:14:33,158 --> 00:14:35,592
Can you shut up for like
five seconds, Betty?

202
00:14:35,593 --> 00:14:39,258
Oh, my God, you are being such
a horrid little bitch right now.

203
00:14:39,259 --> 00:14:43,462
How can you just...
Aren't you scared?

204
00:14:44,272 --> 00:14:46,671
I haven't slept at all,
I feel like I'm losing...

205
00:14:46,672 --> 00:14:49,608
Suck it up. End of story.

206
00:14:49,609 --> 00:14:52,203
I will not go down
with you, Bianca.

207
00:14:56,651 --> 00:15:00,586
Alice Bundy? Hi.
I'm Mary Lou Baumgartner.

208
00:15:00,587 --> 00:15:02,383
Beta Kappa Theta
West Coast Alumni...

209
00:15:02,384 --> 00:15:03,946
Save it,
I already hate you.

210
00:15:03,947 --> 00:15:07,359
...Vice Parliamentarian.
Oh. Well.

211
00:15:08,096 --> 00:15:12,657
I know you were Doreen's best friend
and I just wanted to introduce myself

212
00:15:12,658 --> 00:15:16,363
and tell you that if there's
anything that I or Beta Kappa Theta

213
00:15:16,364 --> 00:15:21,342
can do for you during this very difficult
time, please don't hesitate to ask.

214
00:15:21,544 --> 00:15:24,604
How does it feel being
Queen of the Damned?

215
00:15:25,348 --> 00:15:27,009
Alice, I'm sure I don't know
what you mean.

216
00:15:27,216 --> 00:15:30,879
Just stay away from me.
Fair warning.

217
00:15:39,328 --> 00:15:41,023
Ew! Hair.

218
00:15:42,031 --> 00:15:43,293
Yeah.

219
00:15:46,335 --> 00:15:47,528
What are you doing?

220
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:48,967
I'm riding in the back.

221
00:15:48,968 --> 00:15:50,027
No, you're not.

222
00:15:50,028 --> 00:15:52,473
I'm not gonna take a stray
bullet for you, scarecrow.

223
00:15:52,776 --> 00:15:56,734
Look, even if I wanted to sit in
the front, it's not gonna happen.

224
00:15:56,735 --> 00:15:59,213
My eyes can't take that
kind of direct sunlight.

225
00:15:59,214 --> 00:16:01,443
My rods and cones
are all out of whack.

226
00:16:01,444 --> 00:16:06,147
I took a crowbar to an eye socket
during a sangria party gone wrong.

227
00:16:06,148 --> 00:16:10,386
Long story short, I've got early
onset retinitis pigmentosa.

228
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,668
Hey buddy, good news.

229
00:16:24,669 --> 00:16:28,211
I just got a fax confirming
that the city of Santa Barbara

230
00:16:28,212 --> 00:16:32,716
has unanimously voted you
Exorcist of the year.

231
00:16:33,384 --> 00:16:35,180
Okay, make all
your little jokes.

232
00:16:35,181 --> 00:16:37,584
But I know who's right on my
ass all the way to the car.

233
00:16:37,585 --> 00:16:39,053
I had no choice.
You were my ride home.

234
00:16:39,054 --> 00:16:40,147
Shawn, you were screaming too.

235
00:16:40,148 --> 00:16:43,922
Yes, I was screaming,
"Gus, stop, let's be brave."

236
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:46,653
Look, both the parents and
the best friend were adamant

237
00:16:46,654 --> 00:16:48,756
that Doreen had too much
to live for to kill herself.

238
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,730
Plus, she was pledging
a sorority.

239
00:16:51,202 --> 00:16:53,397
Right. Now, take
another look at this.

240
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:01,471
The latch is broken.

241
00:17:01,472 --> 00:17:03,741
And she fell backwards.

242
00:17:03,742 --> 00:17:05,476
Scary Sherry
took a swan dive.

243
00:17:05,477 --> 00:17:06,539
Exactly.

244
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,313
Gus, you are on fire.
Thank you.

245
00:17:08,314 --> 00:17:11,614
The copy cat suicide angle literally
goes out the window. What next?

246
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:13,680
I couldn't find the word
"Ackenaib" anywhere.

247
00:17:13,681 --> 00:17:16,783
I checked alternate spellings, all
possible roots, nothing in Latin.

248
00:17:16,784 --> 00:17:18,920
So now I'm going through the
dead languages by region.

249
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:21,295
Sanskrit was a wash,
as was Avestan.

250
00:17:21,296 --> 00:17:23,197
Up next is
Old Church Slavonic,

251
00:17:23,198 --> 00:17:26,260
but to be honest I think it's
all just nonsensical gibberish.

252
00:17:26,261 --> 00:17:30,068
But it's gotta mean something. The
voice in the house kept repeating it.

253
00:17:30,069 --> 00:17:34,044
Ackenaib.

254
00:17:36,248 --> 00:17:38,978
Ackenaib. Ackenaib.

255
00:17:47,661 --> 00:17:49,321
What's Juliet's number?
I have a theory.

256
00:17:49,322 --> 00:17:51,192
What's the theory?
Gus, just feed me the digits.

257
00:17:51,193 --> 00:17:53,789
Why do I always have to ask
what the damn theory is, Shawn?

258
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:03,566
Hello?

259
00:18:03,567 --> 00:18:05,473
<i>Is Bianca with you?
Who wants to know?</i>

260
00:18:05,474 --> 00:18:06,738
Jules, where is she?

261
00:18:06,739 --> 00:18:08,336
Okay, tone.

262
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:11,611
She's back at the house with Betty,
running late for the mixer. Just like me.

263
00:18:11,612 --> 00:18:12,810
<i>All right, listen,
I've had a vision.</i>

264
00:18:12,811 --> 00:18:14,819
We need to meet at the
sorority house on the fly.

265
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,480
Shawn, I can't.

266
00:18:16,481 --> 00:18:17,750
I have to make
the spirit speech

267
00:18:17,751 --> 00:18:19,519
<i>and who's gonna fuse
the planter's punch?</i>

268
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,118
<i>Oh, yeah, by the way,
I met Alice Bundy today.</i>

269
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:23,856
She's not a shiny
happy person.

270
00:18:23,857 --> 00:18:24,920
I think...
Jules!

271
00:18:25,132 --> 00:18:27,998
Doreen didn't kill herself.
She was not alone in that room.

272
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:30,534
And we need to talk
to Bianca right now!

273
00:18:30,535 --> 00:18:31,867
She's in danger!

274
00:18:41,315 --> 00:18:44,044
Bianca! What are you
doing in there?

275
00:18:44,045 --> 00:18:46,381
We're gonna be totally late
for Mary Lou's speech

276
00:18:46,382 --> 00:18:48,388
and we're supposed
to lead the slow clap.

277
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,455
Just go without me.
You don't have to wait.

278
00:18:51,456 --> 00:18:53,220
Okay. This is ridiculous.

279
00:18:53,221 --> 00:18:55,854
Just open the door.
I'm coming in there.

280
00:18:55,855 --> 00:18:58,365
I'm not going
to the mixer, Betty.

281
00:18:59,134 --> 00:19:03,069
Even if I wanted to, my fingers
and toes are all pruney now.

282
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,227
Ew!

283
00:19:12,648 --> 00:19:15,344
Bianca, open the door.
This is completely ridiculous.

284
00:19:19,288 --> 00:19:20,311
Hello?

285
00:19:20,312 --> 00:19:23,017
Mary Lou!
It's Bianca! Help!

286
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:40,698
Jules?

287
00:19:51,054 --> 00:19:53,988
Betty, if you know something
you have to tell the chief here.

288
00:19:53,989 --> 00:19:57,424
We're all in danger.
Any one of us could be next.

289
00:19:58,761 --> 00:20:01,490
I can sit here
all night, Betty.

290
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:05,661
I've got six month old who still has
colic, I consider this a reprieve.

291
00:20:07,004 --> 00:20:10,667
Now, why is your friend
Bianca dead?

292
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,406
I can see it. I can see you running
down the hallway at the asylum.

293
00:20:20,407 --> 00:20:21,915
Wait a second.

294
00:20:22,186 --> 00:20:24,450
Doreen wasn't
supposed to die.

295
00:20:24,888 --> 00:20:26,582
This was an accident.

296
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:29,148
The wood was rotten
and the latch broke!

297
00:20:29,593 --> 00:20:31,924
Yes, yes! It broke!

298
00:20:31,925 --> 00:20:35,555
Don't you see we never meant for her
to fall. It was a complete accident!

299
00:20:35,556 --> 00:20:37,759
Oh, my God, Bianca,
what the hell did you do?

300
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,838
Please, do continue.

301
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:45,505
It was my job to get Doreen
into the house.

302
00:20:45,506 --> 00:20:47,043
She knew that it was a haze.

303
00:20:47,044 --> 00:20:49,841
She thought that she was supposed
to spend the whole night inside.

304
00:20:49,842 --> 00:20:52,177
Like that movie with the hedge
maze and Vincent Van Patten?

305
00:20:52,178 --> 00:20:54,241
<i>Hell Night.
Exactly.</i>

306
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:58,979
Bianca was inside wearing this
nightgown, you know, like Scary Sherry,

307
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,922
the girl who jumped from...
We know.

308
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:04,725
Nightgown. Nightgown.
I'm feeling the nightgown.

309
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,420
Put it in.

310
00:21:09,634 --> 00:21:13,297
<i>Bianca buried it in
the tar pits three nights ago.</i>

311
00:21:13,738 --> 00:21:14,965
Tar pits?

312
00:21:14,966 --> 00:21:17,667
I know. It was really
gross and sticky.

313
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:21,309
But, she was just scared.
We both were.

314
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:24,471
Look, it was an accident,
I swear to God.

315
00:21:24,472 --> 00:21:29,578
Bianca tried to grab her arm but it was
too late. Nobody was supposed to die.

316
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,355
Now Bianca's gone, too.

317
00:21:32,356 --> 00:21:33,948
You withheld evidence.

318
00:21:33,949 --> 00:21:38,554
And by conspiring with Bianca we can
charge you with involuntary manslaughter.

319
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,029
You understand that's a crime?

320
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:44,202
I know!

321
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:46,863
No!

322
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:08,753
You actually
slept here last night?

323
00:22:08,754 --> 00:22:12,059
Yes, I did,
it's called crunch time.

324
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:15,057
Have you checked the messages?
Have we heard from Juliet?

325
00:22:15,058 --> 00:22:17,898
Yeah. Alice Bundy's alibi
is airtight.

326
00:22:18,538 --> 00:22:20,004
She lives with
Doreen's family.

327
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,905
Said she went upstairs to bed early
that night and the parents confirmed it,

328
00:22:22,906 --> 00:22:24,909
they were still downstairs
awake when the police called.

329
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,342
Who the hell's doing this?

330
00:22:26,343 --> 00:22:28,381
Oh. And your dad called.

331
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:30,441
What could he possibly want?

332
00:22:30,442 --> 00:22:32,382
Said he wanted to remind you
about dinner tonight.

333
00:22:32,383 --> 00:22:34,545
You're supposed
to bring dessert.

334
00:22:34,546 --> 00:22:35,952
He actually seemed
sort of excited.

335
00:22:35,953 --> 00:22:38,082
Oh, God, that's tonight.

336
00:22:40,228 --> 00:22:41,285
Dude, you have to come.

337
00:22:41,286 --> 00:22:42,794
Oh, I don't know
about that, Shawn.

338
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:45,263
It seems like a pretty big
deal, him reaching out and all.

339
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:46,595
I wouldn't want to intrude.

340
00:22:47,568 --> 00:22:48,864
Gus, he loves you.
He always has.

341
00:22:48,865 --> 00:22:50,402
Plus, if you come
we can roll earlier.

342
00:22:50,403 --> 00:22:51,994
We'll say we're
working on a case.

343
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,336
We are working on a case.
Sweet. So, it's settled.

344
00:22:54,337 --> 00:22:56,739
What are you doing? I have to start
and ultimately finish my route.

345
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,210
Awesome.

346
00:22:59,614 --> 00:23:01,740
I'm going to find
Alice "best friend" Bundy.

347
00:23:01,741 --> 00:23:03,373
Don't you think that girl has
been through enough, Shawn?

348
00:23:03,374 --> 00:23:06,578
Gus, there is no such thing
as an air tight alibi.

349
00:23:06,579 --> 00:23:08,815
And if there is, we're going
to pretend like there isn't.

350
00:23:08,816 --> 00:23:11,723
<i>This girl is Sharon Stone
from Basic Instinct.</i>

351
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:15,091
Which makes me Michael Douglas
and you George Dzundza.

352
00:23:15,092 --> 00:23:18,064
Who's name is
actually Gus in the film.

353
00:23:18,267 --> 00:23:20,131
Until we have another lead,
we assume it's her.

354
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:23,831
We've just got to figure out
the "how." So far, no ice pick.

355
00:23:24,239 --> 00:23:28,436
First of all, don't ever compare my
black ass to George Dzundza again, okay?

356
00:23:28,437 --> 00:23:30,272
Fair. And what can you
possibly ask that girl

357
00:23:30,273 --> 00:23:31,437
that the police
already haven't?

358
00:23:32,548 --> 00:23:35,744
Wanna split a pineapple?
I'm sorry, do I know you?

359
00:23:35,745 --> 00:23:39,752
My name is Ichibod Fletchman. Sticky Icky to
my boys. But that's neither here nor there.

360
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:45,589
What's important is that this baby is
82% Hawaiian and I've got all afternoon.

361
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,562
Are you a crazy person?

362
00:23:50,033 --> 00:23:52,000
It's funny I was about
to ask you the same thing.

363
00:23:52,001 --> 00:23:55,663
Only I was going to add "who likes
to make toast" to the end of mine.

364
00:23:55,972 --> 00:23:58,463
Great. So you're
another cop then?

365
00:23:58,675 --> 00:24:00,539
Not a cop.
Not even close.

366
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,941
Then who are you?

367
00:24:07,817 --> 00:24:11,446
Hint. Green Day there
is about to eat some stone.

368
00:24:16,826 --> 00:24:18,589
How did you do that?

369
00:24:18,962 --> 00:24:21,124
I'm a psychic.
Pass.

370
00:24:21,498 --> 00:24:23,056
Oh, come on.

371
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,164
I was trying to be cool.

372
00:24:25,165 --> 00:24:26,497
What do you want from me?

373
00:24:26,704 --> 00:24:28,898
You want to read my palm?

374
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:31,134
You want a lock of hair?

375
00:24:31,342 --> 00:24:32,502
Alice.

376
00:24:33,243 --> 00:24:35,107
I can feel that
you're hurting.

377
00:24:35,108 --> 00:24:37,374
Really?
Can you feel that I'm hurting?

378
00:24:38,048 --> 00:24:41,347
Come on, psychic, you can do
better than that. Can't you?

379
00:24:41,752 --> 00:24:43,811
Do you have a best friend?
I do.

380
00:24:44,455 --> 00:24:46,251
Since birth, almost.
Great.

381
00:24:46,252 --> 00:24:49,086
Then maybe you can
wrap your head around this.

382
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:51,649
Doreen and I
were closer than sisters.

383
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:54,253
Her parents took me in
when I was seven.

384
00:24:54,254 --> 00:24:57,790
Seven. They raised me.
We did everything together.

385
00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:02,299
The one time I wasn't there,
the one time I let her down,

386
00:25:02,507 --> 00:25:04,270
and now she's gone.

387
00:25:05,477 --> 00:25:08,537
I know that if anything
ever happened to Gus...

388
00:25:08,747 --> 00:25:10,146
I would... I don't know.

389
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:15,246
Look, do you really think
I killed that girl?

390
00:25:16,788 --> 00:25:18,016
Do you?

391
00:25:18,857 --> 00:25:22,792
I understand your suspicion,
but I'm barely hanging on here,

392
00:25:22,793 --> 00:25:24,522
and I just don't think that...

393
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:29,395
I'm not a murderer.

394
00:25:30,735 --> 00:25:32,726
Well, I certainly hope not
for your sake.

395
00:25:35,341 --> 00:25:38,798
Someone came in and emptied the
cash register when I was in the back.

396
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,743
You're not writing this down?

397
00:25:40,946 --> 00:25:43,380
Who's got
the arthritic thumb here?

398
00:25:43,816 --> 00:25:46,785
I hitchhiked from Jersey
to Havana when I was 19.

399
00:25:49,555 --> 00:25:51,852
They also got away with about
$60 worth of rump roast.

400
00:25:51,853 --> 00:25:55,917
Don't try to sell me
on that nonsense, you punk.

401
00:25:56,495 --> 00:25:59,259
What? You think this is
my first square dance?

402
00:26:04,236 --> 00:26:05,862
Give me your gun, Lassiter.

403
00:26:05,863 --> 00:26:09,101
I'll show you how to
make this little pig squeal.

404
00:26:10,644 --> 00:26:11,837
You just gonna let him go?

405
00:26:11,838 --> 00:26:13,435
He's the victim, Goochberg!

406
00:26:13,436 --> 00:26:15,879
Fine. Fine.
I'll do it myself.

407
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,647
Mary Lou, wait!

408
00:26:25,358 --> 00:26:27,291
I totally almost forgot
to give this to you.

409
00:26:27,292 --> 00:26:29,953
What is it, Eden?
I don't know.

410
00:26:29,954 --> 00:26:33,431
It was left on the stoop
like a little baby orphan.

411
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,561
"God's gift is forgiveness.

412
00:26:38,562 --> 00:26:40,605
"Please join us
in remembering our daughter.

413
00:26:40,606 --> 00:26:43,574
"Your attendance
would be greatly appreciated."

414
00:26:43,575 --> 00:26:46,407
Tonight? Hello! Plans.

415
00:26:47,248 --> 00:26:48,476
Bye.
Bye.

416
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:56,145
Boy, we really
should be going.

417
00:26:56,146 --> 00:26:58,214
Come on, guys. Shawn, stay.

418
00:26:58,215 --> 00:26:59,417
Your case will still be there.

419
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:03,293
The sooner we can crack this case
and move on the better. Believe me.

420
00:27:03,294 --> 00:27:04,954
This wouldn't have
anything to do

421
00:27:04,955 --> 00:27:08,092
with the Wispy Sunny Pines
suicide now, would it?

422
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,335
No.
Yes, sir.

423
00:27:12,573 --> 00:27:14,506
Ooh, the plot thickens.

424
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,303
Okay. It's true, fine.

425
00:27:16,304 --> 00:27:17,638
And it hits
a little close to home

426
00:27:17,639 --> 00:27:21,045
seeing as how we were there
the first time it happened.

427
00:27:21,282 --> 00:27:23,409
First time what happened?

428
00:27:26,355 --> 00:27:28,255
Did you open your eyes?

429
00:27:28,924 --> 00:27:31,892
Dad, you've known me my whole
life. Of course, I opened my eyes.

430
00:27:31,893 --> 00:27:35,053
Shawn, that is why I used to refuse
to let you ride around with me.

431
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:36,653
Dad, let it go, I was nine.

432
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:38,961
It's a lack of respect.
Of protocol.

433
00:27:38,962 --> 00:27:42,299
Of protocol? Again, can
I plead nine years old?

434
00:27:47,676 --> 00:27:50,303
And you guys have been freaked
out about this your entire lives?

435
00:27:50,304 --> 00:27:52,472
I don't even drive
by that place.

436
00:27:53,582 --> 00:27:55,481
I really don't think
it's funny.

437
00:27:55,482 --> 00:27:58,485
It was a very scary thing
for two young boys.

438
00:27:58,486 --> 00:28:00,747
<i>It certainly puts a new spin
on the nanny in The Omen.</i>

439
00:28:00,748 --> 00:28:01,812
You know that's right.

440
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,018
Shawn, how much did you see?

441
00:28:05,361 --> 00:28:08,990
I didn't exactly see it.

442
00:28:09,232 --> 00:28:11,165
Luckily, he missed
the bitter, grisly end.

443
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:13,360
Luckily?
Yes, luckily.

444
00:28:13,361 --> 00:28:16,370
I covered his eyes
but we know what happened.

445
00:28:16,371 --> 00:28:17,529
Oh, I beg to differ.

446
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:22,408
It seems you two missed one
very small but important detail.

447
00:28:26,649 --> 00:28:28,276
She never jumped.

448
00:28:30,553 --> 00:28:32,543
What? No.

449
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,851
No, that's impossible.

450
00:28:34,852 --> 00:28:36,515
We saw the window,
she was gone.

451
00:28:36,516 --> 00:28:40,894
Yeah. Because one off-duty police
officer pulled her back inside.

452
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:49,168
Scary Sherry Craddock
was rehabilitated.

453
00:28:49,373 --> 00:28:51,567
I'm pretty sure she's
married and lives in Fresno.

454
00:28:51,568 --> 00:28:54,076
Come on, guys,
give me some credit.

455
00:28:54,645 --> 00:28:58,911
I have no idea how that ridiculous urban
legend got started in the first place.

456
00:29:05,022 --> 00:29:06,079
Your big ass mouth.

457
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,520
I wanted to keep it a secret.

458
00:29:07,521 --> 00:29:11,152
You're the one who was
broadcasting it at the lunch table.

459
00:29:11,428 --> 00:29:12,485
I can't believe this.

460
00:29:12,486 --> 00:29:14,292
We actually started
an urban legend.

461
00:29:14,293 --> 00:29:15,697
That's dope.

462
00:29:17,135 --> 00:29:20,831
Sometimes, Shawn, the answer
is right in front of your eyes.

463
00:29:20,832 --> 00:29:23,534
You just need to choose
to see it.

464
00:29:28,346 --> 00:29:29,938
That was creepy.

465
00:29:32,884 --> 00:29:34,612
This is it.
Alice's house.

466
00:29:34,613 --> 00:29:37,586
I know there's something here,
I just got to find it.

467
00:29:37,587 --> 00:29:40,783
Here's the plan. You ring the
doorbell and distract who...

468
00:29:40,784 --> 00:29:43,453
Who...
Whom... Who...

469
00:29:44,095 --> 00:29:45,925
The person. The person
that answers the door.

470
00:29:45,926 --> 00:29:47,759
I go around back
and look for a way in.

471
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,855
Are you kidding?

472
00:29:48,856 --> 00:29:50,731
It took you the whole ride
to come up with that?

473
00:29:50,732 --> 00:29:52,133
Feel free to make revisions.

474
00:29:52,134 --> 00:29:53,261
How am I supposed
to distract them?

475
00:29:53,262 --> 00:29:55,169
You'll think of something.
Good luck.

476
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,004
We're all counting on you.

477
00:30:01,814 --> 00:30:03,303
Mrs. Harthan?
No.

478
00:30:03,304 --> 00:30:05,406
The Harthans are down
at the cemetery.

479
00:30:05,407 --> 00:30:08,077
I'm Poppy, the housekeeper.
May I help you?

480
00:30:08,078 --> 00:30:09,382
Yes.

481
00:30:09,655 --> 00:30:11,121
Have you seen Mrs. Pickles?

482
00:30:11,122 --> 00:30:13,624
Mrs. Pickles?
Mrs. Pickles.

483
00:30:13,926 --> 00:30:16,723
My Orange Tabby! You
must have seen her before.

484
00:30:16,724 --> 00:30:20,390
She's pregnant with who knows
how many unborn Tabby kittens

485
00:30:20,391 --> 00:30:22,024
and I've lost her.

486
00:30:26,773 --> 00:30:29,332
You know that growing up
in Edinburgh,

487
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:31,308
my sisters and I
had a basset hound

488
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:33,174
who used to
hoot like a snowy owl.

489
00:30:33,175 --> 00:30:35,544
No kidding.
What was his name?

490
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,510
We called him Basset Hound.

491
00:30:38,511 --> 00:30:41,815
Although my sister, she always
used called him Uncle Jimmy.

492
00:30:41,816 --> 00:30:43,515
I never knew why.

493
00:30:48,595 --> 00:30:50,893
Mrs. Pickles!

494
00:30:51,698 --> 00:30:55,156
Here. Your Mrs. Pickles will
come back to you, D'Andre.

495
00:31:24,098 --> 00:31:27,033
<i>Doreen and I
were closer than sisters.</i>

496
00:31:41,183 --> 00:31:43,173
What in heaven's that?

497
00:31:43,174 --> 00:31:45,445
I've got to
set this thing on vibrate.

498
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:47,545
<i>I'm sorry, who is this?
Shawn, it's Eden!</i>

499
00:31:47,546 --> 00:31:49,385
<i>Who?
From Beta Kappa Theta.</i>

500
00:31:49,386 --> 00:31:51,755
<i>Are you coming to our party
or what the heck?</i>

501
00:31:51,756 --> 00:31:53,259
<i>There are cops here
and everything.</i>

502
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,316
Let me talk to Mary Lou.

503
00:31:54,317 --> 00:31:56,989
<i>Mary Lou had to go to some
candlelight vigil thingy for Doreen.</i>

504
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,329
Vigil? What vigil?
There...

505
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:01,767
<i>Yeah, at that creepy
Wispy Sunny Pines' place.</i>

506
00:32:05,074 --> 00:32:08,237
Bianca buried it at the
tar pits three nights ago.

507
00:32:10,946 --> 00:32:12,607
<i>What about Bud?
Can he come?</i>

508
00:32:34,971 --> 00:32:39,704
<i>Has anyone ever told you that you look
like little Bud from the old Cosby Show?</i>

509
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:42,605
Yes, ma'am.
But I was not Bud.

510
00:32:48,151 --> 00:32:49,311
Hello?

511
00:32:49,686 --> 00:32:50,913
You bet.

512
00:32:50,914 --> 00:32:52,683
It's her.
Who?

513
00:32:52,923 --> 00:32:54,914
Mrs. Pickles. She's home.

514
00:32:58,462 --> 00:32:59,792
I believe it was...
It was her.

515
00:32:59,793 --> 00:33:02,058
And I've got the how. We have
to go to Wispy Sunny Pines.

516
00:33:02,059 --> 00:33:03,997
What? No, no. You said
go to the sorority house.

517
00:33:03,998 --> 00:33:05,500
The girls are fine.
The cops are there.

518
00:33:05,501 --> 00:33:07,695
Meanwhile, Juliet's at
some candlelight vigil

519
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:09,135
with Doreen's family
at the asylum.

520
00:33:09,136 --> 00:33:10,467
Wait. No, no.
The housekeeper said

521
00:33:10,468 --> 00:33:13,065
Doreen's parents
were at the cemetery.

522
00:33:13,066 --> 00:33:14,270
What?

523
00:33:15,846 --> 00:33:17,404
What?
Oh, God!

524
00:33:18,015 --> 00:33:21,040
Of course. Why mess around with the
worker bees when you can kill the queen?

525
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:23,483
What are you talking
about, Shawn? Gus, Alice.

526
00:33:23,484 --> 00:33:26,351
She wanted us all at
that party, including us,

527
00:33:26,352 --> 00:33:28,322
so that she could get
Mary Lou by herself.

528
00:33:28,323 --> 00:33:30,292
<i>This is Silence of the Lambs!</i>

529
00:33:30,293 --> 00:33:32,762
Which means
we're both Scott Glen.

530
00:33:33,031 --> 00:33:34,224
Okay, Shawn, listen to me.

531
00:33:34,225 --> 00:33:35,993
If I'm gonna go back to
that creepy ass institution

532
00:33:35,994 --> 00:33:37,624
that I've been afraid to
drive by since I was nine,

533
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:39,225
there are going to be
some rules and regulations.

534
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:41,328
Gus, this is no time for...
Listen, Shawn.

535
00:33:41,329 --> 00:33:44,033
I will not enter a room first.
I will not enter a room last.

536
00:33:44,034 --> 00:33:47,339
I will not investigate any suspicious
noises or go looking for a fuse box.

537
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,038
And you will not,
under any circumstances,

538
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,479
leave me by myself
without a weapon of some sort.

539
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,073
Do you understand
and agree to my terms?

540
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:55,414
I'm not prepared to negotiate.
Do you understand, Shawn?

541
00:33:55,415 --> 00:33:57,614
Yes! I do! Yes!
All right.

542
00:33:58,323 --> 00:33:59,915
Let's go help Juliet.

543
00:34:08,901 --> 00:34:11,392
Scarecrow, did we get him?

544
00:34:11,671 --> 00:34:13,661
No. No.
Of course, we didn't get him.

545
00:34:13,662 --> 00:34:17,469
Your little pursuit sort of ended
when you had a mild cardiac arrest.

546
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:19,567
When were you gonna tell me
about the pacemaker?

547
00:34:19,568 --> 00:34:22,408
And how dare you try and
scale a fence in high heels?

548
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:24,107
He was the victim,
Goochberg.

549
00:34:24,108 --> 00:34:25,912
But did we get him?

550
00:34:34,393 --> 00:34:36,918
Yeah.
Yeah, we got him, Goochberg.

551
00:34:41,234 --> 00:34:43,533
Lassiter. Spencer?

552
00:34:44,204 --> 00:34:46,034
You realize you are the
second last human person

553
00:34:46,035 --> 00:34:47,971
on this planet I want to
be speaking to right now.

554
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:14,466
Call for backup, O'Hara.
Just make the call.

555
00:35:14,668 --> 00:35:15,965
Better safe than sorry.

556
00:35:19,274 --> 00:35:22,072
Mary Lou. We're over here.

557
00:35:29,817 --> 00:35:32,182
I have to say I'm a little
shocked to see you here.

558
00:35:32,183 --> 00:35:34,550
Where's everyone else?
Upstairs.

559
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:36,690
They're waiting for you.

560
00:35:37,058 --> 00:35:38,615
I told them
you probably wouldn't show.

561
00:35:38,616 --> 00:35:42,220
Maybe you misjudged me.
Maybe I did.

562
00:35:43,698 --> 00:35:45,063
Follow me.

563
00:35:47,635 --> 00:35:50,297
Wow!
This must have taken hours.

564
00:35:56,412 --> 00:36:00,610
I mean, this is really
extensive, candle-wise.

565
00:36:08,824 --> 00:36:11,759
<i>The whole family is
waiting in room 413. Okay.</i>

566
00:36:32,882 --> 00:36:35,077
Alice, what the hell is this?

567
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,883
Welcome to the party,
Mary Lou.

568
00:36:41,858 --> 00:36:43,883
It's a banquet
fit for a queen!

569
00:36:48,198 --> 00:36:52,692
Alice, you do not wanna do this. Give
me the axe. I'm not who you think I am.

570
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:56,768
No. You're exactly
who I think you are.

571
00:36:57,374 --> 00:37:01,002
You're the reason girls vomit
and starve themselves to death.

572
00:37:01,003 --> 00:37:04,102
And you're the reason that they
fill themselves with plastic.

573
00:37:04,103 --> 00:37:07,013
And you are the reason
that Doreen is dead.

574
00:37:08,152 --> 00:37:09,709
And so now,

575
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:13,348
on behalf of the entire suit
of the broken hearts,

576
00:37:13,991 --> 00:37:16,687
Alice will now lop off
the Queen's head.

577
00:37:21,132 --> 00:37:24,431
That just sounded so much better
out loud than it did in my head.

578
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:36,073
Lassie, our timing
is really starting to crackle.

579
00:37:46,024 --> 00:37:48,720
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
We made a deal, Shawn!

580
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:51,226
Thank you.

581
00:38:04,476 --> 00:38:05,908
Get it out! Get it out!

582
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,034
Pull your foot
out of the shoe!

583
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,442
I can't! It's too tight!

584
00:38:08,443 --> 00:38:10,707
Don't leave me, Shawn!
That was rule number five!

585
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:13,011
Loosen your big toe?
I can't move my big toe.

586
00:38:13,012 --> 00:38:14,573
What?
Work the laces!

587
00:38:14,574 --> 00:38:16,985
Shawn, Shawn! Shawn!

588
00:38:20,187 --> 00:38:21,487
O' Hara!
Juliet!

589
00:38:40,468 --> 00:38:43,538
That is it!
Now you die for sure!

590
00:38:43,783 --> 00:38:45,410
I don't think so.

591
00:38:47,153 --> 00:38:50,850
You are under arrest, you
crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy bitch!

592
00:38:51,057 --> 00:38:52,684
Detective!
Juliet!

593
00:39:01,034 --> 00:39:02,092
Hey.

594
00:39:12,813 --> 00:39:14,075
I got it.

595
00:39:16,483 --> 00:39:17,745
I got it.

596
00:39:27,027 --> 00:39:28,823
What in the hell happened
in there?

597
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:30,192
She's crazy!

598
00:39:30,193 --> 00:39:31,924
Look, she's possessed.
You have to believe me.

599
00:39:31,925 --> 00:39:33,863
O'Hara?
You're asking me?

600
00:39:33,864 --> 00:39:35,799
I though I was coming to
a candlelight vigil.

601
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,133
I thought I was coming
to pay my condolences.

602
00:39:38,134 --> 00:39:39,763
Apparently
that wasn't the case.

603
00:39:39,764 --> 00:39:40,865
Ow!

604
00:39:43,044 --> 00:39:44,511
Give me that.

605
00:39:45,046 --> 00:39:47,378
What would
you have done, Shawn?

606
00:39:48,216 --> 00:39:50,309
If it was your best friend?

607
00:39:52,654 --> 00:39:54,679
What would you have done?

608
00:39:57,559 --> 00:39:59,720
Oh, no. Gus.

609
00:40:15,711 --> 00:40:18,339
Shawn, come get me
out of here!

610
00:40:19,381 --> 00:40:21,406
This is not funny, Shawn!

611
00:40:28,457 --> 00:40:30,583
Did I upset you?
Upset me?

612
00:40:30,584 --> 00:40:34,253
Insult you? Demean you in some
way that I did not comprehend?

613
00:40:34,254 --> 00:40:37,127
Detective, I am pretty sure I have
no idea what you are talking about.

614
00:40:37,128 --> 00:40:39,598
The woman.
The crazy woman.

615
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,431
The half-deaf litigating
nightmare express of a detective.

616
00:40:42,432 --> 00:40:44,801
Why would you put me,
of all people, with her?

617
00:40:44,802 --> 00:40:45,998
I'm head detective.

618
00:40:45,999 --> 00:40:48,771
Honestly, detective, I thought
you two might hit it off.

619
00:40:48,772 --> 00:40:50,106
Why would you
possibly think that?

620
00:40:50,107 --> 00:40:52,272
She kinda reminded me
a little of you.

621
00:40:52,273 --> 00:40:53,440
You know,
a few years down the road.

622
00:40:53,441 --> 00:40:55,642
Similar interests. Outlooks.

623
00:40:55,643 --> 00:40:58,210
Everyone thought
it was a good idea.

624
00:40:59,756 --> 00:41:01,986
That's how people perceive me?

625
00:41:03,326 --> 00:41:06,420
We're all surprised
it didn't work out, Carlton.

626
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:36,125
You sick mother...

627
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,756
Dude, we could hear
you from the fourth floor.

628
00:41:41,757 --> 00:41:43,857
Don't lie! Don't lie!

629
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,439
Hey, Lassie.

630
00:42:15,634 --> 00:42:19,195
<i>In between the lines
there's a lot of obscurity</i>

631
00:42:19,438 --> 00:42:22,737
<i>I'm not inclined
to resign to maturity</i>

632
00:42:22,941 --> 00:42:26,171
<i>If it's all right
then you're all wrong</i>

633
00:42:26,172 --> 00:42:29,702
<i>But why bounce around
to the same damn song?</i>

634
00:42:30,749 --> 00:42:35,015
<i>You'd rather run
when you can't crawl</i>

635
00:42:37,056 --> 00:42:40,684
<i>I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth</i>

636
00:42:40,685 --> 00:42:43,728
<i>I know, you know
They just don't have any proof</i>

637
00:42:43,729 --> 00:42:46,992
<i>Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend</i>

638
00:42:46,993 --> 00:42:51,126
<i>Your worst inhibitions tend
to psych you out in the end</i>

639
00:42:51,127 --> 00:42:52,899
<i>I know, you know</i>

640
00:42:54,707 --> 00:42:56,368
<i>I know, you know</i>
