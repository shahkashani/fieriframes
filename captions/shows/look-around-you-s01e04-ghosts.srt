1
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,951
Look around you.

2
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,637
Look around you.

3
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,959
Just look around you.

4
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,034
Have you worked out
what we're looking for?

5
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,433
Correct. The answer is...

6
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,879
This programme, "Ghosts",

7
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,839
is discussed in chapter 15
of your textbook,

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,560
which accompanies this series.

9
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,030
Please ensure you have
your copybook at hand,

10
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,396
as you'll be asked to take down
notes from the screen

11
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,394
at various points
throughout the programme.

12
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,079
Ghosts.

13
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,630
You may know them
as ghouls or phantoms,

14
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,510
or demons, or spirits,
or spirims, or spictrims.

15
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,436
From the sightings of the
headless spirit of King Henry VIII

16
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,399
to the poltergeist activity
of the ghost of Sir Ian Whitaker,

17
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,871
former General Secretary
of the TGWU,

18
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,316
ghosts are all around us.

19
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,794
But there's no need
to be scared of ghosts.

20
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,550
- (SCREAMS)
- It's a very childish attitude,

21
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,111
as the majority of them
are quite harmless.

22
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,557
This spirit is helping a girl
with her homework,

23
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,270
while this one is mending
its master's caravan.

24
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,639
Most of us are interested
in the spirit world,

25
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,679
and if we're not reading about it
in popular magazines,

26
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,514
we're paying a visit
to our local medium.

27
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,797
They usually have
something interesting to say.

28
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,795
Are you still making that lovely
onion soup for yourself, dear?

29
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,912
An experiment was carried out

30
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,636
to produce
a visualisation of a spirit.

31
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,716
In order to visualise, we'll
be using this piece of equipment,

32
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,839
a Gloriette 80 Materialiser,

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,233
a complex arrangement
of diodes, marbles and valves

34
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,360
which enables us to make
visual contact with the dead.

35
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,756
The machine is turned on,

36
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,438
and then primed
by inserting the crucifix.

37
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,920
(WHIRRING)

38
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,040
A candle is placed
on a map of Cornwall

39
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,716
and the scientist
begins his incantation.

40
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,554
Make sure you note it down.

41
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,393
Emarf wodniw eht gnitsud
saw aniram.

42
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,671
Emarf wodniw eht...

43
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,437
There's our spirit.
He appears to be in some distress.

44
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,559
Perhaps he's missing colleagues
or loved ones back at home.

45
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,076
He may even be missing you.

46
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,357
Do you know this man?

47
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,716
(GROWLS)

48
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,557
Now let's see what a ghost can do
under controlled conditions.

49
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,316
Can a spirit pass through
a solid surface?

50
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,912
Evidently, yes.

51
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,954
Drink a glass of orange squash?

52
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,599
Thirsty work. How about
trying on this hat for size?

53
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,836
It fits!

54
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,912
- (GLASS SMASHES)
- If the ghost misbehaves,

55
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,477
we administer
a strong electric current.

56
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,954
Note that down
in your copybook now.

57
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,232
Not all ghosts
are of living things.

58
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,360
This roll of sticky tape,
for instance, is a ghost.

59
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,910
So is this van.

60
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,798
Sometimes,
when a ghost materialises,

61
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,920
it leaves behind a physical
residue, known as ectoplasm.

62
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,592
It's perfectly safe to eat.

63
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,720
In fact many people have likened
the taste to that of pigs' milk.

64
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,636
One way in which ghosts
are different from man

65
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,911
is that they can' t whistle.

66
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,440
Try as they might, the most they
can muster is a rather feeble hiss.

67
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,910
Perhaps it's because
their lips are transparent

68
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,237
and their tongues are see-through.

69
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,556
But despite our differences,

70
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,839
man and ghost
can forge a successful partnership.

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,550
Let's look at this phenomenon
more closely,

72
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,151
as we step inside
the haunted laboratory.

73
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,920
An experiment was carried out

74
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,154
to demonstrate how man and ghost
can work together as a team.

75
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,712
Let's see how the partnership works

76
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,349
as together
they measure the effects

77
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,677
of nitric acid upon calcium.

78
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,117
Get ready
to write down your observations.

79
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,191
First, a bottle of powdered calcium
is placed upon the work surface.

80
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,873
Next, a small amount of calcium
is poured into the beaker.

81
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,717
Only about 4,000 million biligrams,
or 4 grams.

82
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,076
That's enough.

83
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,960
Ghosts can be
a little unpredictable at times.

84
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,040
The scientist fetches
a fresh beaker,

85
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,516
and the experiment continues.

86
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,950
Now for the nitric acid.

87
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,555
Nitric acid is highly corrosive,

88
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,918
so care must always be taken
when handling.

89
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,714
- (GHOST) Hello!
- Using a pipette,

90
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,520
the ghostly assistant
collects a few drops of the acid.

91
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,670
Now the ghoul is instructed to
release the acid into the beaker.

92
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,752
Come on.

93
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,751
(SIZZLING)

94
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,596
This is a naughty spirit.
That could have hurt.

95
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,394
The scientist will need
to rinse the affected area

96
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,120
with cold water immediately.

97
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,871
(ALARM)

98
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,555
(WHOOSHING AND GROANING)

99
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,000
It seems that for this spirit,
teamwork is not on the agenda.

100
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,878
The scientist has no choice
but to abandon the experiment.

101
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,555
Note that down
in your copybook now.

102
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,797
Over the course of this module,

103
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,270
we've learnt a lot
about the nature,

104
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,193
characteristics

105
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,556
and behaviour of ghosts.

106
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,599
So the next time you're playing
with your Ouija board,

107
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,195
take a moment out to remember this.

108
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,240
In the end, you too will die
and become a ghost.

109
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,711
It may be in fifty years,
it may be tomorrow.

110
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,872
It may even be...

111
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,793
today.

112
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,433
Now hand in your copybooks
to your teacher or head of class.

113
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,357
In the next programme,
we will look at reggae.

114
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,872
(REGGAE MUSIC)
