1
00:00:13,712 --> 00:00:17,010
Hey, Shawn, what in the world
do you think you're doing?

2
00:00:17,011 --> 00:00:19,174
Hide and seek.
I don't think so.

3
00:00:19,175 --> 00:00:21,547
But you said we could.
Not like that.

4
00:00:21,548 --> 00:00:22,846
That's how you play.

5
00:00:22,847 --> 00:00:25,479
Not in my house. Shawn, you
can't tail a suspect like that.

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,958
Look how loud you are. Your perp is
gonna hear you coming from every turn.

7
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:31,961
Those things smack
every time you take a step.

8
00:00:31,962 --> 00:00:34,053
Now, if you're gonna wear them
when you compete, you gotta keep...

9
00:00:34,054 --> 00:00:35,155
Compete?

10
00:00:35,156 --> 00:00:38,668
On the balls of
your feet. Balls of your feet.

11
00:00:39,703 --> 00:00:41,364
And you take deliberate steps.

12
00:00:41,938 --> 00:00:43,564
You don't know where he is.

13
00:00:44,307 --> 00:00:46,399
He shouldn't get to know
where you are.

14
00:00:46,742 --> 00:00:49,210
He's invisible,
you're invisible.

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,275
Now, you've leveled the
playing field. Can I go now?

16
00:00:53,276 --> 00:00:55,907
No. You're going to learn
to do the little things right.

17
00:00:55,908 --> 00:00:57,213
For instance,

18
00:00:58,686 --> 00:01:01,210
when you peer
around a corner,

19
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:03,381
I want you to stay
down low 'cause, you see,

20
00:01:03,382 --> 00:01:05,652
they're expecting you
up here at eye level.

21
00:01:05,653 --> 00:01:07,717
When you walk down a hall,

22
00:01:07,718 --> 00:01:10,923
check the grains of the carpet.
We just vacuumed, right?

23
00:01:11,765 --> 00:01:15,758
And never, ever again do I ever
want to hear you slam a door

24
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,099
when you can pull it closed.
But we're just playing.

25
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,197
Well, play right, Shawn,
or don't play at all.

26
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:30,012
Shawn,

27
00:01:31,617 --> 00:01:33,016
he's not in here.

28
00:01:42,194 --> 00:01:43,887
I don't need to
tell you how vital it is

29
00:01:43,888 --> 00:01:46,622
that we maintain the utmost
secrecy on this heist.

30
00:01:46,623 --> 00:01:49,096
The Attorney General does not
want his son's wedding disrupted

31
00:01:49,097 --> 00:01:50,359
any more than
it's already been.

32
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,094
How will we explain
our presence to the press?

33
00:01:52,095 --> 00:01:54,329
We don't.
Just let them stew.

34
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,234
Well, that's one approach.

35
00:01:56,235 --> 00:02:00,641
But, if I may suggest, I once wrote a paper
regarding press releases and such and...

36
00:02:02,278 --> 00:02:04,906
Sorry, your idea sounds great.

37
00:02:08,518 --> 00:02:10,008
Get the board.

38
00:02:15,624 --> 00:02:17,853
What are you doing?
Dude, I'm onto something big.

39
00:02:17,854 --> 00:02:19,825
Tailing cops?
In a police station?

40
00:02:19,826 --> 00:02:21,794
Some monumentally expensive
ring just got stolen.

41
00:02:21,795 --> 00:02:23,455
I'm gonna get
us on the case.

42
00:02:23,456 --> 00:02:24,792
We just got a case
five minutes ago.

43
00:02:24,793 --> 00:02:27,390
Yeah, a lame one. Stolen
computers from a high school.

44
00:02:27,391 --> 00:02:29,868
Come on, like, you were falling
asleep during that meeting.

45
00:02:37,978 --> 00:02:41,311
This is an heirloom.
It's worth $5 million,

46
00:02:41,312 --> 00:02:44,681
lifted from the hotel where they're
having the wedding. Wedding's on Saturday.

47
00:02:44,951 --> 00:02:47,440
There's an open bar.

48
00:02:47,441 --> 00:02:50,080
Dude, we're so there. Are
we looking at the same thing?

49
00:02:52,658 --> 00:02:55,558
I told you to wait in my
office. I had a premonition.

50
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:58,926
Something sparkly.
Just over five karats,

51
00:02:58,927 --> 00:03:00,658
perfect clarity,
slight inclusion.

52
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:02,597
Is this ringing
any bells for you?

53
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:06,002
Solve the case I gave you.
Then we'll talk.

54
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:09,773
In the meantime, I have a
lot of work to complete.

55
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:11,941
It's the secretary.

56
00:03:12,743 --> 00:03:15,007
Pardon? The secretary.
The secretary did it.

57
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:17,410
Now, what can you tell me
about the ring I'm envisioning?

58
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:19,072
But you barely even
looked at this folder.

59
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,672
It's in the papers.
Where?

60
00:03:20,673 --> 00:03:22,411
The signatures,
it's in her handwriting.

61
00:03:22,412 --> 00:03:26,183
Look, she's faking her own signature,
and later there's evidence that it's...

62
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:34,155
I feel it in the ink.

63
00:03:35,332 --> 00:03:37,093
Very bad vibes.

64
00:03:37,094 --> 00:03:40,726
Strong squidish vibes.

65
00:03:41,236 --> 00:03:45,071
We'll check it out. Until then,
I trust you can find the door.

66
00:03:45,707 --> 00:03:48,267
But what about the ring?
Not until this one is done.

67
00:03:51,913 --> 00:03:55,211
Hey, let me gather some information,
all right? Make a little headway.

68
00:03:55,212 --> 00:03:58,080
Then I'll have a psychic episode that
blows the ears right off their skulls.

69
00:03:58,081 --> 00:03:59,618
Shawn, I'm in
meetings all day.

70
00:03:59,619 --> 00:04:03,179
I barely had time to come down for this.
We're doing what the Chief says. Period.

71
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:16,569
So sorry to have
kept you waiting.

72
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:22,297
I am Shawn Spencer, chief
psychic here at the department.

73
00:04:22,298 --> 00:04:25,342
Thank you so much for helping. This
whole thing has been devastating.

74
00:04:25,343 --> 00:04:27,274
My hands are still shaking.

75
00:04:27,275 --> 00:04:30,041
You're doing fine.
Okay, I only have a second.

76
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:32,378
I'll need you to tell me everything
I have to know about this case

77
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:34,281
as quickly as humanly
possible, okay?

78
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:38,387
What about this guy? What's
going on with the best man?

79
00:04:38,388 --> 00:04:40,514
I don't know, he's not
answering his phone or his door.

80
00:04:40,515 --> 00:04:42,751
This day has just
been completely unreal.

81
00:04:42,752 --> 00:04:45,124
Guys, it's going to be fine.

82
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,025
You're in good hands.
I have never failed a case.

83
00:04:47,026 --> 00:04:49,861
I know who you are.
I read about you in the paper.

84
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,698
You did?

85
00:04:57,807 --> 00:05:00,400
You're the sister
of the groom.

86
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:09,781
And the maid of honor.

87
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:12,808
And the wedding planner?
Correct.

88
00:05:12,809 --> 00:05:15,218
That is so many hats.
You should see my closet.

89
00:05:15,219 --> 00:05:16,689
I am hoping to.

90
00:05:17,158 --> 00:05:18,886
But not until
I find this ring.

91
00:05:18,887 --> 00:05:21,826
Well, the wedding's tomorrow.
How fast are you?

92
00:05:21,827 --> 00:05:24,056
That depends entirely on how
much cooperation I receive.

93
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,358
Why don't you come
to the wedding?

94
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:28,059
Yeah. No, no, I couldn't
possibly impose on you. No.

95
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,365
Please, you're
saving us here.

96
00:05:30,904 --> 00:05:33,134
You find this ring,
we'd owe you everything.

97
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,399
What in the hell
is going on here?

98
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,410
I just dropped by
to say hello.

99
00:05:39,411 --> 00:05:43,470
Guys, this is head detective Carlton
Lassiter and his lovely new partner, Juliet.

100
00:05:43,471 --> 00:05:46,814
His last one turned out to be his
girlfriend, so she was transferred.

101
00:05:47,153 --> 00:05:50,245
I'm not sure if that was the only reason.
I'll let you decide for yourselves.

102
00:05:50,246 --> 00:05:51,722
Shall we?
Sure.

103
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,617
If this is some sort of hazing ritual, where
we're gonna end up naked in a river somewhere,

104
00:05:58,618 --> 00:06:00,323
I'll need to arrange
for a ride home.

105
00:06:00,998 --> 00:06:02,488
Listen to me, Spencer.

106
00:06:02,489 --> 00:06:05,126
The department's reputation
is on the line with this one.

107
00:06:05,127 --> 00:06:09,639
If I catch you anywhere near this case, I
will throw every book I can find at you.

108
00:06:10,174 --> 00:06:13,665
What if you find the Bible?
You going to throw that, too?

109
00:06:14,044 --> 00:06:16,443
Seems a little sacrilegious
to me, don't you think?

110
00:06:23,285 --> 00:06:24,583
Ow.

111
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:33,183
<i>I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth</i>

112
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:36,695
<i>I know, you know
They just don't have any proof</i>

113
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:39,756
<i>Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend</i>

114
00:06:39,757 --> 00:06:43,930
<i>Your worst inhibitions tend
to psych you out in the end</i>

115
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,823
Burton Guster, Central Coast
Pharmaceuticals.

116
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:07,255
<i>Dude, I got a suspect...</i>

117
00:07:07,256 --> 00:07:08,384
I'll call you back
later, Shawn.

118
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:11,088
No, no, you can't. I left my
cell phone in your car yesterday,

119
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:12,993
along with a tuna sandwich.

120
00:07:12,994 --> 00:07:14,463
<i>I seriously hope
you found that.</i>

121
00:07:14,464 --> 00:07:15,624
Later this afternoon, Shawn.

122
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:18,329
No, no, Gus, this happens now.
The wedding is tomorrow.

123
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:24,734
Is he coming?

124
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,799
Not yet.
But we're getting closer.

125
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:29,104
Thanks, Stabber.

126
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,785
Mandatory briefing.
Magnolia room. 15 minutes.

127
00:07:38,786 --> 00:07:41,220
Excuse us, please.
Attorney General Maxwell.

128
00:07:41,221 --> 00:07:42,951
Detective, I trust
we're making progress.

129
00:07:42,952 --> 00:07:44,685
I am right on
schedule, sir.

130
00:07:44,686 --> 00:07:47,250
I've booked myself a suite
to use as a command center.

131
00:07:47,251 --> 00:07:48,386
Why?

132
00:07:48,387 --> 00:07:50,363
I'll stay the night if I have
to. Keep an eye on things.

133
00:07:50,364 --> 00:07:51,798
The city's not paying
for that, is it?

134
00:07:52,968 --> 00:07:54,195
No?

135
00:07:54,196 --> 00:07:56,829
That ring has been in
my family for 200 years.

136
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,805
My mother agonized over the
decision to give it to my son.

137
00:07:59,806 --> 00:08:01,101
I'm not letting it
get away now.

138
00:08:01,102 --> 00:08:03,575
Sir, we are checking every
person who came through that door.

139
00:08:03,576 --> 00:08:04,941
Every employee.
Every guest.

140
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,104
Nobody checks
out of this hotel

141
00:08:06,105 --> 00:08:08,512
until we're just short of going
through every piece of their luggage.

142
00:08:08,513 --> 00:08:10,516
Way ahead of you, sir.
No, you're not.

143
00:08:14,288 --> 00:08:15,380
What?

144
00:08:23,997 --> 00:08:25,691
Can I help you, sir?

145
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:29,396
I'm just

146
00:08:30,035 --> 00:08:31,298
listening.

147
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,071
For what?
For what?

148
00:08:40,111 --> 00:08:41,702
Lyme disease.
Lyme disease?

149
00:08:41,703 --> 00:08:45,509
Lyme disease, rickets, avitaminosis,
Legionnaire's, bubonic. You name it.

150
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,551
I want you to
listen to something.

151
00:08:47,552 --> 00:08:48,675
Do you hear that?
Mmm-hmm.

152
00:08:48,676 --> 00:08:49,878
We have spores in the wall.

153
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,682
Spores? You know
where else they are?

154
00:08:51,683 --> 00:08:55,919
In the planter. You know where else?
Everywhere in the entire hotel.

155
00:08:57,461 --> 00:08:59,189
Who called you? Mike?

156
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,286
Mike? Is this
a big joke to you?

157
00:09:01,287 --> 00:09:04,832
I don't answer to Mike. Have you seen
Mike lately? Mike can kiss my ass.

158
00:09:05,068 --> 00:09:06,932
I was called in by
the state inspector himself.

159
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:09,493
Are you at all aware how dangerous
this is? Hell, yes, I am!

160
00:09:09,494 --> 00:09:10,730
Good. I'm glad.

161
00:09:10,731 --> 00:09:12,933
I need access to this whole
place, elevator shafts, air vents,

162
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:14,234
the safe room, obviously.

163
00:09:14,235 --> 00:09:15,571
The safe room
is a crime scene.

164
00:09:15,572 --> 00:09:17,874
This eucalyptus
will be dead by lunch.

165
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:21,973
The safe room will be a triage unit if
I don't get those spores out of there.

166
00:09:22,251 --> 00:09:26,152
Understood. Can we let the
cops finish up in there first?

167
00:09:26,854 --> 00:09:28,377
Tell them to hurry.

168
00:09:28,378 --> 00:09:29,684
Oh, man.

169
00:09:36,897 --> 00:09:39,592
Thirteen minutes after midnight,
members of the wedding party

170
00:09:39,593 --> 00:09:42,657
enter the safe room, placing the
ring into a safety deposit box,

171
00:09:42,658 --> 00:09:45,636
which was slid into the safe
and closed for the night.

172
00:09:45,637 --> 00:09:48,229
No sensors indicate
that either the safe door

173
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,106
or the lock box was opened again
until the following morning.

174
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:56,313
Please note, he has activated the time
lock, which prevents the safe from opening.

175
00:09:56,682 --> 00:09:59,980
No one walks into that room again
until the following morning,

176
00:09:59,981 --> 00:10:01,779
when the ring is
discovered missing.

177
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,480
So it definitely didn't
disappear during the night?

178
00:10:04,481 --> 00:10:05,955
Or so they would
like you to think.

179
00:10:05,956 --> 00:10:10,050
However, if you look closely, there
are nine glitches on this tape.

180
00:10:10,051 --> 00:10:11,525
I'm sorry, glitches?

181
00:10:11,526 --> 00:10:13,392
Seams, static bursts
in the image.

182
00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:17,558
Someone could have tapped in an alternate
video feed of this room while it was empty.

183
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:20,535
Or, more likely,
as I believe,

184
00:10:21,472 --> 00:10:24,099
someone built a scale
replica of this room.

185
00:10:27,577 --> 00:10:28,909
Who laughed?

186
00:10:30,613 --> 00:10:31,910
Nobody?

187
00:10:35,876 --> 00:10:38,442
If somebody disagrees with
my theory, I'd like to know.

188
00:10:38,443 --> 00:10:41,319
It does seem
very elaborate.

189
00:10:41,591 --> 00:10:43,523
And just a bit far-fetched.

190
00:10:43,524 --> 00:10:45,958
Are you a detective?
Why are you here?

191
00:10:46,394 --> 00:10:48,521
You asked for
all of us to come.

192
00:10:48,897 --> 00:10:52,354
Oh, well, Officer, since you're
such an expert on fetching,

193
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,430
why don't you fetch
me a cup of coffee?

194
00:11:01,976 --> 00:11:03,307
Moving on.

195
00:11:03,911 --> 00:11:07,471
All the employee alibis
check out. Except this one.

196
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:09,207
Dietrich Mannheim.

197
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,839
Currently
the facilities manager.

198
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,816
You may remember him
from the security video.

199
00:11:12,817 --> 00:11:16,685
He was in the room when the ring was
placed into the safety deposit box.

200
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,721
During questioning,
he was nervous, evasive,

201
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:21,759
and contradicted himself
more than once.

202
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,159
His work computer history reveals
that he recently visited websites

203
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:30,360
for boats and expensive cars, and
he failed to show up for work.

204
00:11:32,704 --> 00:11:34,034
Questions?

205
00:11:34,473 --> 00:11:35,962
Is this your only lead?

206
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:40,841
His responses to my interrogation
were hostile at best.

207
00:11:41,512 --> 00:11:42,773
Clarify "hostile".

208
00:11:42,774 --> 00:11:45,542
Use my tone now as a guide.

209
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:08,161
Detective O'Hara,
all alone?

210
00:12:08,536 --> 00:12:10,368
Well, not anymore, apparently.

211
00:12:11,739 --> 00:12:13,263
Work troubles?

212
00:12:13,264 --> 00:12:16,401
I'm sensing work troubles.

213
00:12:16,911 --> 00:12:18,901
Here, let me read your palm.

214
00:12:18,902 --> 00:12:20,310
How about just one finger?

215
00:12:20,311 --> 00:12:22,177
Come, now, let me see
if I can be helpful.

216
00:12:22,178 --> 00:12:24,045
Why are you here?

217
00:12:24,046 --> 00:12:25,813
The Maxwell wedding.

218
00:12:26,687 --> 00:12:28,382
Honestly. I was invited.

219
00:12:28,383 --> 00:12:29,546
By whom?

220
00:12:29,547 --> 00:12:31,716
Beth. Bethany. The bride.

221
00:12:32,426 --> 00:12:35,553
Little baby B.
The B sting. Love her.

222
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,424
God, Dylan is so
lucky to have her.

223
00:12:37,425 --> 00:12:40,659
She grounds him in ways that he
needed grounding, don't you think?

224
00:12:45,538 --> 00:12:47,369
She's a good sport.

225
00:12:49,874 --> 00:12:51,431
Air Supply, really?

226
00:12:51,432 --> 00:12:53,705
Kidding. Just kidding.
Relax.

227
00:12:55,714 --> 00:12:57,113
This is work-related.

228
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:02,385
You thought this place
would be different,

229
00:13:03,321 --> 00:13:06,415
but nobody respects
your opinions.

230
00:13:08,258 --> 00:13:10,623
They all think
you're too young?

231
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,159
Always.

232
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,491
Always.

233
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,267
You know, I think you and
I could help each other.

234
00:13:19,268 --> 00:13:20,460
And how would that be?

235
00:13:20,461 --> 00:13:24,232
Oh, I know things.
Things about rings.

236
00:13:24,233 --> 00:13:26,672
Oh. I thought you were
here for a wedding.

237
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:29,337
I am... ish.

238
00:13:39,387 --> 00:13:40,478
You first.

239
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:48,790
I just got a
message for you, Mr. Guster, and,

240
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,922
well, I'm afraid
it's about your cat.

241
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:53,022
My cat?

242
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:56,261
The poor thing is in the animal
hospital. They think her leg is broken.

243
00:13:56,262 --> 00:13:58,166
I'll get down there later.

244
00:13:58,167 --> 00:13:59,534
You're not going?

245
00:13:59,535 --> 00:14:01,072
I'm very busy.

246
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:04,769
But your cat needs you for moral support.
The vet said it could be the difference.

247
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,070
Later.

248
00:14:06,071 --> 00:14:07,169
You have to go.

249
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:09,110
Mr. Guster, I know
that you're in shock.

250
00:14:09,111 --> 00:14:11,273
Don't do anything you're
going to regret forever.

251
00:14:11,274 --> 00:14:12,942
I don't even...
He's not going?

252
00:14:23,294 --> 00:14:24,352
Oh.

253
00:14:26,264 --> 00:14:27,787
So, now I have a cat?

254
00:14:27,788 --> 00:14:31,355
An orange tabby. Last Christmas, you made
her a tiny Santa hat. It was adorable.

255
00:14:31,356 --> 00:14:33,424
Fantastic. I can't even
have a make-believe boy cat.

256
00:14:33,425 --> 00:14:36,130
Gus, a boy cat wouldn't serve
my purposes nearly as well.

257
00:14:36,131 --> 00:14:38,799
The next time I need you,
Pickles is having kittens.

258
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,307
Pickles?
Mrs. Pickles is her full name.

259
00:14:41,308 --> 00:14:43,844
Though, I'm not actually sure
cats can marry outside of Boston.

260
00:14:43,845 --> 00:14:45,540
Yeah, well,
in a related issue,

261
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:48,048
I'm blocking your number on
all the phones in the office.

262
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:50,050
If you think that will work,
I think it's endearing.

263
00:14:50,051 --> 00:14:52,211
In the meantime, aren't you
the least bit curious

264
00:14:52,212 --> 00:14:55,223
about who was there when they
put the ring in the hotel safe?

265
00:14:56,324 --> 00:14:57,849
Wait a minute.

266
00:14:58,127 --> 00:14:59,490
This is a safecracking case?

267
00:14:59,491 --> 00:15:01,188
Did I forget to mention that?

268
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:05,324
What kind of safe?

269
00:15:05,325 --> 00:15:08,334
The Hydra 700.

270
00:15:08,335 --> 00:15:09,835
The 700 is out?

271
00:15:10,572 --> 00:15:13,233
That's impossible,
nobody could crack that.

272
00:15:13,234 --> 00:15:15,741
I haven't even told you about
the wall sensors.

273
00:15:17,611 --> 00:15:19,100
Can we be done by 3:00?

274
00:15:19,947 --> 00:15:21,005
Yes.

275
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:27,944
The safe room,
right behind that door.

276
00:15:30,256 --> 00:15:33,019
What is all this? I thought
this was a safe job.

277
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,856
Oh, Lassiter has this insane idea
that this in an elaborate heist, right?

278
00:15:36,857 --> 00:15:39,919
<i>Like on par with Ocean's
Eleven, or Thomas Crown,</i>

279
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,522
or... Oh, the one where
they kill Donald Sutherland

280
00:15:42,523 --> 00:15:44,794
in the first ten minutes,
remake...

281
00:15:44,795 --> 00:15:47,462
Mr. Spencer, Mr. Guster,
what a surprise.

282
00:15:47,463 --> 00:15:51,029
Chief. Looking good.
You're probably wondering...

283
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:54,805
I sent an officer down to the high school
to take a look at your secretary suspect.

284
00:15:56,347 --> 00:15:58,871
She cracked. He didn't even
get the first question out.

285
00:15:58,872 --> 00:16:00,142
Really?

286
00:16:01,352 --> 00:16:03,944
'Cause I envisioned
that being harder.

287
00:16:03,945 --> 00:16:07,217
Yet I don't recall asking you to
come down here to the De La Cruz.

288
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,979
Well, we have
reason to believe

289
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,991
this case goes in a
completely different direction.

290
00:16:10,992 --> 00:16:12,150
Huh.

291
00:16:12,151 --> 00:16:14,491
Let me be perfectly clear.

292
00:16:16,331 --> 00:16:18,731
I didn't see you
and we didn't talk.

293
00:16:20,903 --> 00:16:22,733
Call me if you have something.

294
00:16:27,109 --> 00:16:28,769
I love her.
Yeah.

295
00:16:42,156 --> 00:16:43,280
He knows you?

296
00:16:43,281 --> 00:16:46,017
I had to lay some groundwork. He doesn't
believe in psychics. This is plan B.

297
00:16:46,018 --> 00:16:47,580
Chief Inspector Shawn,
how are you?

298
00:16:47,581 --> 00:16:49,287
I'm undercover.

299
00:16:49,288 --> 00:16:51,225
Not even the American
police know I'm in on this.

300
00:16:51,226 --> 00:16:52,888
I'm sorry.
I blew it again, didn't I?

301
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:54,522
And after you brought
me into your confidence.

302
00:16:54,523 --> 00:16:57,295
Bobby, it's fine.
Believe me.

303
00:16:57,296 --> 00:17:01,030
These other Interpol guys are very
appreciative of what you're doing here.

304
00:17:01,031 --> 00:17:02,367
<i>How long will you need?</i>

305
00:17:02,368 --> 00:17:04,636
Just as discussed,
five minutes, tops.

306
00:17:05,677 --> 00:17:07,167
You're my man.

307
00:17:12,483 --> 00:17:13,743
Interpol?

308
00:17:13,744 --> 00:17:15,408
That's right.
Missing Ring Division.

309
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,385
I believe I was recruited out
of North Africa when I was 15.

310
00:17:18,386 --> 00:17:19,819
You could at least
use a British accent.

311
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,084
Oh, please,
Gus, I started with a British accent,

312
00:17:22,085 --> 00:17:25,219
and then seamlessly slipped
into my fake American one.

313
00:17:25,928 --> 00:17:27,418
Bobby gave me
some pointers.

314
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:29,965
Apparently you Americans
say "howdy" a lot.

315
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,294
Howdy.

316
00:17:34,904 --> 00:17:36,131
What are you doing?

317
00:17:36,132 --> 00:17:39,571
List. List. I made a list of suspects
after attending Lassiter's briefing.

318
00:17:39,572 --> 00:17:40,800
He let you in his briefing?

319
00:17:40,801 --> 00:17:42,969
He does when
you're in the airshaft.

320
00:17:43,611 --> 00:17:45,202
All your suspects are
in the wedding party?

321
00:17:45,203 --> 00:17:47,577
Look, the only ones who knew
they put that ring in the safe

322
00:17:47,578 --> 00:17:48,774
were at the rehearsal dinner.

323
00:17:48,775 --> 00:17:51,010
So, it was an inside job?
Looking like it.

324
00:17:52,587 --> 00:17:53,813
You're making keys?

325
00:17:53,814 --> 00:17:55,650
Gus, how else do you expect
me to get in the rooms?

326
00:17:55,651 --> 00:17:56,848
Shawn, you can't do that.

327
00:17:56,849 --> 00:17:58,618
Of course I can, I
worked at the Hampton Inn

328
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,750
for that three-day weekend
in Austin when we were 19.

329
00:18:00,751 --> 00:18:03,022
I know you remember that.
Gus, this is so easy.

330
00:18:03,023 --> 00:18:04,393
Try making a key.

331
00:18:11,671 --> 00:18:13,138
Dude, I rule.

332
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:14,698
Nope. Innocent.
Let's move.

333
00:18:14,699 --> 00:18:16,763
What are you talking about? We
haven't even stepped foot in there.

334
00:18:16,764 --> 00:18:19,072
Gus, do you need
the remedial course, really?

335
00:18:22,714 --> 00:18:24,773
Uncle Leo left
his wallet on the table.

336
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:27,743
Criminals are sneaky,
jaded, suspicious people.

337
00:18:27,744 --> 00:18:29,614
They're smart
and defensive.

338
00:18:29,615 --> 00:18:31,587
This guy has a reason
to be trusting.

339
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:33,280
Can we go now?

340
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:40,456
Shawn?

341
00:18:40,457 --> 00:18:43,295
Guys, hey,
your door was open.

342
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:44,625
Oh, it was?

343
00:18:44,626 --> 00:18:48,864
Yes, and I was worried that something
horrible had happened. You're okay?

344
00:18:48,865 --> 00:18:50,303
Yeah, yeah.

345
00:18:51,499 --> 00:18:53,768
I told you we didn't have to
come in here. They're fine.

346
00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:56,436
Everybody's fine.
This is my associate, Gus.

347
00:18:56,437 --> 00:18:58,377
Just call him Peter Panic.

348
00:18:58,748 --> 00:19:00,077
How are you doing?

349
00:19:00,078 --> 00:19:01,673
So, you're a psychic, too?

350
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:03,843
Well... Gus here
is a safe expert.

351
00:19:04,486 --> 00:19:07,943
<i>Yes, he subscribes to
The Safecracker,</i>

352
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:11,520
a safecracking comic book.

353
00:19:12,293 --> 00:19:15,456
It's an online magazine.
And it's a trade publication.

354
00:19:15,963 --> 00:19:21,333
Excuse me for saying so, but how exactly
do you figure into this legal family?

355
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:24,728
I started my
criminal law degree.

356
00:19:24,729 --> 00:19:29,969
Then I came to my senses, went to
Europe, painted, slept, ate, sank a boat.

357
00:19:31,511 --> 00:19:33,068
Disappointed?
Besotted.

358
00:19:33,413 --> 00:19:35,470
We'd like to speak to the
best man, if possible.

359
00:19:35,471 --> 00:19:36,948
So would we.

360
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,513
Any ideas where he is?

361
00:19:38,514 --> 00:19:40,710
We haven't seen him since
the night of the sixth.

362
00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:42,480
Which is the night
the ring disappeared.

363
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,146
The florist quit.

364
00:19:44,147 --> 00:19:45,984
So, after we dropped
the ring off at the safe,

365
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:48,456
we had to wrap bouquets
all night in our suite.

366
00:19:48,457 --> 00:19:50,993
Everybody except Jack.
Do you think he's a suspect?

367
00:19:50,994 --> 00:19:52,996
No, we just
think he's lazy.

368
00:19:53,765 --> 00:19:56,063
Hey, Dad,
this is Shawn Spencer.

369
00:19:56,501 --> 00:19:58,195
He's the psychic
I told you about.

370
00:19:59,104 --> 00:20:01,196
I know. Let's talk.

371
00:20:03,173 --> 00:20:06,539
Son, I'm very comfortable with the
current direction of the investigation.

372
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,770
So, let's let the real police
department do their job.

373
00:20:08,771 --> 00:20:10,972
Sir, believe me,
I am only here to help.

374
00:20:12,516 --> 00:20:14,482
In fact, I was actually
hoping to discuss...

375
00:20:14,483 --> 00:20:15,949
I'm glad you understand.

376
00:20:18,888 --> 00:20:21,220
The guy shook my hand like
I stole something.

377
00:20:25,328 --> 00:20:27,922
You see? That's why I
can't do this job alone.

378
00:20:33,135 --> 00:20:36,035
Wow. That is about
as orange as you can get.

379
00:20:37,405 --> 00:20:39,200
Which suspect's room
is this? Lassiter's.

380
00:20:39,201 --> 00:20:41,797
The head detective?
He has his own room?

381
00:20:41,798 --> 00:20:43,309
Perhaps paid
for by the city.

382
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:46,071
No. No. This is going too
far. We're not staying.

383
00:20:46,072 --> 00:20:48,341
Gus, we need these
witness statements.

384
00:20:48,342 --> 00:20:51,747
It's not exactly like we're being
overwhelmed with cooperation here.

385
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,820
Oh, Lacey.

386
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,617
Lacey, you can
sink my boat.

387
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,058
Toss me the remote.

388
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:16,133
<i>It's the bottom of the
eighth inning and so far it's been...</i>

389
00:21:16,134 --> 00:21:17,798
What do you got?
You got anything good?

390
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:19,136
I hate to say it,
but yeah.

391
00:21:19,137 --> 00:21:21,576
The Attorney General has an
insurance policy on the ring.

392
00:21:21,577 --> 00:21:24,944
He'll collect a cool $3 million on
it as long as it still belongs to him,

393
00:21:24,945 --> 00:21:27,346
which it does only until
these two are married.

394
00:21:27,347 --> 00:21:28,544
Well, well, well.

395
00:21:41,798 --> 00:21:43,320
I'm supposed to knock.

396
00:21:43,321 --> 00:21:45,229
Forgive me, Detective.

397
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,666
Detective?

398
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:48,600
Head Detective. Sorry.

399
00:21:49,771 --> 00:21:51,830
I was told you wouldn't
be here until 6:00 tonight.

400
00:21:51,831 --> 00:21:54,340
That's right. 6:00
tonight. Head Detective.

401
00:21:54,341 --> 00:21:56,309
I changed my plan.
Please don't tell anyone.

402
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,969
Absolutely, sir.

403
00:21:58,613 --> 00:22:00,876
Thanks. 6:00, huh?

404
00:22:00,877 --> 00:22:02,848
Is there anything I can
do for you while I'm here?

405
00:22:02,849 --> 00:22:04,713
As a matter of fact,
yes, there is.

406
00:22:04,714 --> 00:22:07,218
We'd like a room service
menu delivered immediately.

407
00:22:08,822 --> 00:22:12,223
In Lassiter's photo, there didn't
appear to be a mark on that safe.

408
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,349
I don't care
how good you are,

409
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:16,725
you don't crack a Hydra without
leaving some sort of visible residue.

410
00:22:16,726 --> 00:22:18,194
We need to see that safe.

411
00:22:18,195 --> 00:22:20,232
That's going to be
a little difficult.

412
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,024
How close you
need to be?

413
00:22:26,672 --> 00:22:28,195
Is there a secret back door
through the kitchen?

414
00:22:28,196 --> 00:22:29,604
No, we're gonna
take the air vents.

415
00:22:29,605 --> 00:22:32,870
Unfortunately, both my access points
are blocked by Santa Barbara's finest.

416
00:22:32,871 --> 00:22:34,103
You think I'm
going in there?

417
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:35,577
You know you want to.
Not in this suit.

418
00:22:35,578 --> 00:22:37,170
Gus, do you wanna see
the safe or not?

419
00:22:37,171 --> 00:22:39,478
Look, this will be easy. We take
this dumbwaiter up to the grate,

420
00:22:39,479 --> 00:22:41,518
pop the screen, crawl
right through the shafts.

421
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:44,714
Three rights and a left. We check
our progress through the vents.

422
00:23:08,477 --> 00:23:11,809
Isn't it kind of weird how the
body's just shoved in here?

423
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:14,973
No, what's weird is there's
a dead guy in a dumbwaiter

424
00:23:14,974 --> 00:23:18,246
and we're standing here staring at it,
waiting for somebody to find us. Let's go!

425
00:23:18,247 --> 00:23:19,479
This is Lassiter's suspect.

426
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,383
Shawn, close the hatch
and keep your voice down.

427
00:23:21,384 --> 00:23:22,752
I don't want to explain
how we got here.

428
00:23:22,753 --> 00:23:24,085
I just need to
see one thing.

429
00:23:31,131 --> 00:23:33,258
You answered it. Hello?

430
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:34,390
Three days, Shawn.

431
00:23:34,391 --> 00:23:35,957
Dad, hey, gonna
have to call you back.

432
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,833
No, no. You were supposed
to call me yesterday.

433
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:40,964
You were supposed to call me the day
before. We need to handle this now.

434
00:23:40,965 --> 00:23:42,098
Dad, I'm a little
busy right now.

435
00:23:42,099 --> 00:23:46,008
Shawn, just tell me when you are going to
come by and pick up the box of trophies?

436
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:47,272
Really tough to be sure.

437
00:23:47,273 --> 00:23:49,540
Last week you were all gung-ho
about getting this stuff back.

438
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:51,479
I went upstairs,
I brought it down for you,

439
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,949
<i>it's sitting in the
middle of my kitchen table.</i>

440
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:55,648
I need my kitchen table,
Shawn.

441
00:23:55,649 --> 00:23:57,312
You're right. Can I
please call you back, Dad?

442
00:23:57,313 --> 00:23:58,878
How about you just
give me an answer?

443
00:23:58,879 --> 00:24:00,981
Tonight.
No. Tomorrow.

444
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:02,389
Tomorrow, wonderful.

445
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:06,521
Otherwise, I am putting it outside,
and that's where it's sitting.

446
00:24:06,522 --> 00:24:07,756
Now how hard was that?

447
00:24:07,757 --> 00:24:08,923
So easy. Anything else?

448
00:24:08,924 --> 00:24:11,126
No, unless, of course,
you need something.

449
00:24:11,127 --> 00:24:14,137
Nope. I'm good. Well, actually,
wait, I do have one question.

450
00:24:15,572 --> 00:24:16,596
Go ahead.

451
00:24:16,597 --> 00:24:20,200
How long does it take before a
dead body starts to smell bad?

452
00:24:21,911 --> 00:24:23,277
Oh, God.

453
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:27,412
Did you wipe
our fingerprints off?

454
00:24:27,413 --> 00:24:29,178
Of course I did.
We were never there.

455
00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:30,410
We need to call
the Chief soon.

456
00:24:30,411 --> 00:24:32,180
If Dietrich was a part
of this, he's not anymore.

457
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:34,812
Why is it the Attorney
General has to call me

458
00:24:34,813 --> 00:24:38,757
wondering why some civilian is wandering
around grilling his entire family?

459
00:24:38,758 --> 00:24:41,557
Wait a second. The Attorney
General has your number?

460
00:24:41,558 --> 00:24:43,061
What are you guys, tight?

461
00:24:43,062 --> 00:24:44,256
Give it up.
What's the story?

462
00:24:44,257 --> 00:24:47,493
He also told me to keep you out
of here by any means necessary,

463
00:24:47,494 --> 00:24:51,197
which opens up an entire world of
exciting possibilities for me, personally.

464
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,295
Ow!

465
00:24:58,612 --> 00:25:00,078
Gosh!

466
00:25:00,414 --> 00:25:01,506
Gosh!

467
00:25:02,615 --> 00:25:06,016
Oh, it's too much!
It's too much!

468
00:25:07,221 --> 00:25:08,777
You're not going
to shoot him, are you?

469
00:25:08,778 --> 00:25:09,947
I haven't decided.

470
00:25:09,948 --> 00:25:12,251
Oh, my ear.
Gus, my ear.

471
00:25:12,252 --> 00:25:16,261
Oh, for the love of Mike, you are not
gonna escape. Would you just give it up?

472
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,865
Give it up!

473
00:25:24,569 --> 00:25:28,163
Check the dumbwaiter. Open the
dumbwaiter. Detective O'Hara!

474
00:25:30,408 --> 00:25:31,499
Oh, my God!

475
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,940
Lassiter. Lassiter.

476
00:25:36,914 --> 00:25:38,848
Lassy... Get over here!

477
00:25:41,117 --> 00:25:43,243
Let's go. Get him
in the van.

478
00:25:43,244 --> 00:25:44,512
Come on.

479
00:25:44,513 --> 00:25:46,019
You two, out.

480
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,283
No. Don't we get to wait
around for the autopsy?

481
00:25:48,284 --> 00:25:49,654
No, we'll call you
if we need you.

482
00:25:49,655 --> 00:25:50,748
Detective.

483
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:53,192
Sir? Shut this
down. Keep it quiet.

484
00:25:53,193 --> 00:25:56,230
Nobody in the wedding party is to know
about this. They've been through enough.

485
00:25:56,231 --> 00:25:57,425
Yes, sir.

486
00:25:57,801 --> 00:25:59,233
So, this is it.

487
00:26:00,503 --> 00:26:02,436
Well, that ought to keep
them busy for a while.

488
00:26:06,507 --> 00:26:08,997
Can we at least watch the tape in
another room besides Lassiter's?

489
00:26:08,998 --> 00:26:11,270
Gus, he's not coming back.
Are you sure about that?

490
00:26:11,271 --> 00:26:13,142
Yes, didn't you
check his messages?

491
00:26:14,015 --> 00:26:15,572
Are you gonna have
some cookies? No.

492
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:16,877
Do you wanna finish
my banana?

493
00:26:16,878 --> 00:26:18,282
I want to leave.

494
00:26:23,824 --> 00:26:26,020
Look at the best man.
He's smashed.

495
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,519
And look at his hair.
It's horrible.

496
00:26:36,203 --> 00:26:37,225
That's it?

497
00:26:37,226 --> 00:26:39,203
We have to watch it again.

498
00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:41,663
It's open.

499
00:26:41,664 --> 00:26:43,401
It's open?
What are you doing?

500
00:26:44,977 --> 00:26:46,273
Oh, what am I early?

501
00:26:46,274 --> 00:26:48,108
Big Dyl,
you're right on time.

502
00:26:50,782 --> 00:26:53,774
Did I forget to mention that
we're hosting the bachelor party?

503
00:26:58,623 --> 00:26:59,679
No, thank you.

504
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:03,021
He says, "Uh-oh. I thought you said
you wanted it inside the piñata."

505
00:27:04,355 --> 00:27:06,020
Eat. Eat like men.

506
00:27:08,398 --> 00:27:10,193
You're really mad?

507
00:27:10,194 --> 00:27:12,130
We have less than 12
hours to solve the case,

508
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:14,668
and you're throwing a kegger
in a police officer's room.

509
00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:15,896
Why would I be mad?

510
00:27:15,897 --> 00:27:19,372
Gus, his best man was a total
washout, he wasn't gonna plan anything.

511
00:27:19,373 --> 00:27:22,433
We have to dig information out of
suspects, and you're wasting time.

512
00:27:23,346 --> 00:27:24,404
Dylan!

513
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,109
Dude. You, wow!

514
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,309
Yes, wow!

515
00:27:29,818 --> 00:27:33,014
Gus here has some questions for
you, you flaxen-haired Argonaut.

516
00:27:33,015 --> 00:27:36,251
Anything for you two.
I love you guys.

517
00:27:37,025 --> 00:27:39,151
I've found that they're
particularly forthcoming

518
00:27:39,152 --> 00:27:40,920
with information
while in this state.

519
00:27:40,921 --> 00:27:44,089
For example, I've eliminated
every suspect here.

520
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:46,522
Although there is
a guy stealing cable

521
00:27:46,523 --> 00:27:48,931
and another refilling his
minibar bottles with shampoo,

522
00:27:48,932 --> 00:27:52,529
but I don't think those are
gateway crimes to a jewelry heist.

523
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,573
Seriously. Gus, come on,
give me a kiss.

524
00:27:57,643 --> 00:27:59,942
No, no, nothing weird,
on my cheek.

525
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:02,939
Get me out of here. I think
it's your turn to dig.

526
00:28:04,817 --> 00:28:06,544
Do you know
who stole the ring?

527
00:28:06,545 --> 00:28:07,295
No.

528
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,817
And to be honest,
I don't care.

529
00:28:10,818 --> 00:28:12,822
I didn't even want
the damn thing.

530
00:28:13,524 --> 00:28:16,857
Okay. The night that we
announced our engagement, no,

531
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:20,856
my Dad stops dinner right
in the middle of my speech.

532
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:26,965
So, he goes and gets
my grandmother's ring.

533
00:28:27,538 --> 00:28:29,732
What am I supposed
to say? No?

534
00:28:29,733 --> 00:28:32,273
So, now it's not about us,
it's about him again.

535
00:28:32,274 --> 00:28:35,208
I mean, forget that
I just chose the person

536
00:28:35,209 --> 00:28:37,508
that I wanna spend
the rest of my life with.

537
00:28:41,951 --> 00:28:44,215
I don't wanna seem ungrateful,

538
00:28:45,087 --> 00:28:46,577
but if it were up to me,

539
00:28:47,389 --> 00:28:49,357
I'd sooner just stop looking.

540
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,049
Cross him off.

541
00:28:53,262 --> 00:28:55,456
Dylan, how is Dad?

542
00:28:55,457 --> 00:28:59,466
I mean, financially,
would you say everything is...

543
00:29:02,103 --> 00:29:03,195
Okay.

544
00:29:04,104 --> 00:29:05,663
So much for that.

545
00:29:05,974 --> 00:29:08,908
Dylan was the only shot we had
in this room, but that's okay.

546
00:29:09,242 --> 00:29:11,437
We have other suspects
in this hotel.

547
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:14,303
At least take a traveler.

548
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,752
Sweet nectar.

549
00:29:22,753 --> 00:29:24,413
Yeah. All right.

550
00:29:24,414 --> 00:29:27,321
Crazy running into you guys
here. What are the odds?

551
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,094
You got anything? These
girls are not criminals.

552
00:29:31,095 --> 00:29:32,789
It was worth a shot.

553
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,492
You wanna get out of here?

554
00:29:37,493 --> 00:29:39,059
Yes, I do.

555
00:29:44,775 --> 00:29:46,868
So, how are you
holding up? I'm good.

556
00:29:47,344 --> 00:29:50,211
My dad brought in all this
extra security for some reason.

557
00:29:51,281 --> 00:29:53,510
Can he afford that?
What do you mean?

558
00:29:53,511 --> 00:29:56,552
I don't know, it's just... It was a tough
year financially for a lot of people...

559
00:29:56,553 --> 00:29:57,744
What are you
getting at?

560
00:29:57,745 --> 00:29:59,344
I'm just making
random conversation.

561
00:29:59,345 --> 00:30:01,822
Here's my bouquet.

562
00:30:01,823 --> 00:30:03,755
Oh, it's fantastic.

563
00:30:03,756 --> 00:30:07,851
Well, it's sub-par. I was
rushed. All that craziness.

564
00:30:07,852 --> 00:30:09,623
I wish I could fix it.

565
00:30:09,624 --> 00:30:11,563
Well, let's just take it out.

566
00:30:11,564 --> 00:30:13,032
It's locked.

567
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,093
They lock up flowers?

568
00:30:17,139 --> 00:30:19,437
I bet you could open it.
You have good hands.

569
00:30:23,912 --> 00:30:25,036
Shawn!

570
00:30:25,037 --> 00:30:26,443
Excuse me.

571
00:30:26,914 --> 00:30:28,005
You left me there!

572
00:30:28,006 --> 00:30:29,911
Yes, I did. And
you're very welcome.

573
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:32,473
I just got a lap dance
from Patrick Swayze!

574
00:30:32,474 --> 00:30:34,383
What do you mean?
Like an impersonator?

575
00:30:34,384 --> 00:30:36,513
No, I think it was
actually Patrick Swayze.

576
00:30:36,924 --> 00:30:38,014
I'm going home.

577
00:30:38,015 --> 00:30:41,491
We're done. All we've done is eliminate
suspects. We're back where we started.

578
00:30:41,492 --> 00:30:43,027
Oh, Gus, we're fine.

579
00:30:43,028 --> 00:30:45,358
We've got the whole wedding
ceremony tomorrow to solve the case.

580
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:49,459
Oh, oh, okay. So, we can do what an
entire police force can't in two hours?

581
00:30:50,703 --> 00:30:51,931
Hmm.

582
00:30:52,337 --> 00:30:53,736
Okay, you're right.

583
00:30:54,106 --> 00:30:56,233
We should totally get
there half an hour early.

584
00:31:13,978 --> 00:31:16,558
You are the most beautiful
bride in this room.

585
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,025
Oh, thank you.

586
00:31:18,026 --> 00:31:19,152
Does anyone need help?

587
00:31:19,153 --> 00:31:20,660
The bouquets
still aren't here.

588
00:31:20,661 --> 00:31:22,527
We might as well
not even have the ceremony.

589
00:31:22,528 --> 00:31:24,361
Okay, you, relax. Breathe.

590
00:31:24,362 --> 00:31:26,560
Think happy thoughts
like puffy clouds,

591
00:31:26,836 --> 00:31:29,600
mac and cheese,
Lou Diamond Phillips.

592
00:31:30,707 --> 00:31:31,832
Look, it worked.

593
00:31:33,209 --> 00:31:34,732
What are you doing?
Helping.

594
00:31:34,733 --> 00:31:37,209
No, those bouquets
are very specific.

595
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:39,109
They look
identical, ma'am.

596
00:31:39,347 --> 00:31:41,473
It's my wedding, shouldn't
I be the one freaking out?

597
00:31:41,474 --> 00:31:43,516
Oh, there'll be plenty
of time for that later.

598
00:31:43,517 --> 00:31:47,020
Where is it? Where?
Where's my bouquet?

599
00:31:47,021 --> 00:31:49,749
She's really a very nice person
under normal circumstances.

600
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:52,918
Lace? Everything okay
up here? You all right?

601
00:31:53,261 --> 00:31:57,958
Yeah. Sorry. I think I'm having
sympathy Bridezilla. I'm good now.

602
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:59,088
Great.

603
00:31:59,089 --> 00:32:01,292
Emma doesn't wanna wear
the flower in her hair.

604
00:32:04,904 --> 00:32:06,838
But these are
magic flowers.

605
00:32:12,678 --> 00:32:14,076
Do you want one now?

606
00:32:18,384 --> 00:32:20,680
I don't know what to tell you,
sir, but these are the charges.

607
00:32:20,681 --> 00:32:23,243
$1,600 for a
junior suite?

608
00:32:23,755 --> 00:32:24,880
With a queen bed?

609
00:32:24,881 --> 00:32:26,286
Well, the room was
a small portion.

610
00:32:26,287 --> 00:32:28,917
However, it's all your room
charges that drove up your bill.

611
00:32:28,918 --> 00:32:30,186
I was hardly
even in the room!

612
00:32:30,187 --> 00:32:33,230
I'm sorry, Detective Lassiter,
but that's what it says here.

613
00:32:34,365 --> 00:32:36,128
This isn't
Detective Lassiter.

614
00:32:37,066 --> 00:32:38,226
I beg your pardon?

615
00:32:38,227 --> 00:32:41,202
Oh, he's a shorter guy.
Brown hair.

616
00:32:41,203 --> 00:32:45,001
Suede jacket. Helped him fill the
Jacuzzi with champagne last night.

617
00:32:45,002 --> 00:32:49,066
Really? If I brought this man
here, could you identify him?

618
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:52,078
Oh, absolutely. In fact, I
can tell you where he is.

619
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:53,843
He's over at
the Maxwell wedding.

620
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:56,414
The chapel is just
outside the east lawn.

621
00:32:57,586 --> 00:32:58,985
I'll be right back.

622
00:33:00,889 --> 00:33:02,479
"I, Dylan, take you Bethany."

623
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,081
I, Dylan, take you Bethany.

624
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:05,955
"To be my wife."
To be my wife.

625
00:33:05,956 --> 00:33:07,357
"Confidant
of my heart."

626
00:33:07,358 --> 00:33:08,952
Confidant
of my heart.

627
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:10,553
"That you will
be a faithful friend."

628
00:33:10,554 --> 00:33:12,359
That you will be
a faithful friend.

629
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,729
"And a true and
loving companion."

630
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:14,993
And a true and
loving companion.

631
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:16,433
"I give to you my
sacred vow."

632
00:33:16,434 --> 00:33:17,662
Excuse me.

633
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:19,729
I give to you
my sacred vow.

634
00:33:20,507 --> 00:33:22,941
I think we should wait
until the ceremony's over.

635
00:33:23,176 --> 00:33:24,268
Fine.

636
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,574
Nice suit. Where'd
you get that from?

637
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:32,750
Gus, don't underestimate
me, or my wardrobe.

638
00:33:33,986 --> 00:33:35,146
You might want to
remove...

639
00:33:35,147 --> 00:33:37,553
Don't pull that off!
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

640
00:33:37,554 --> 00:33:38,988
Just slide it...

641
00:33:44,396 --> 00:33:46,920
They're here for you. Not
if I solve this case first.

642
00:33:46,921 --> 00:33:48,658
Good plan. You got
about five minutes.

643
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:49,892
I already know
who did it.

644
00:33:49,893 --> 00:33:51,764
No, you don't.
How is that possible?

645
00:33:51,765 --> 00:33:53,928
Between all that, when
you said your girlfriend

646
00:33:53,929 --> 00:33:56,198
just had an aneurysm because
she got the wrong bouquet,

647
00:33:56,199 --> 00:33:59,070
you had time to put all that out
of your mind and solve the case?

648
00:33:59,071 --> 00:34:00,666
Gus.
What?

649
00:34:01,011 --> 00:34:03,343
And now for
a moment of silence.

650
00:34:05,048 --> 00:34:07,482
Gus, I seriously
do have a guess.

651
00:34:07,951 --> 00:34:09,281
Probability of
being right?

652
00:34:09,282 --> 00:34:11,217
I don't know,
high sixties.

653
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,453
Close your mouth. But
the person's in the room.

654
00:34:13,454 --> 00:34:15,250
The thief
could potentially escape.

655
00:34:15,251 --> 00:34:16,984
Shouldn't I stop
the wedding? No.

656
00:34:16,985 --> 00:34:19,960
Under no circumstances are you
allowed to stop this wedding.

657
00:34:20,496 --> 00:34:23,986
If there's any reason why
these two should not be wed,

658
00:34:23,987 --> 00:34:26,795
speak now or forever
hold your peace.

659
00:34:30,772 --> 00:34:32,569
I have something.

660
00:34:33,008 --> 00:34:36,738
It's not necessarily marriage-related.
I hope that's not a problem.

661
00:34:37,444 --> 00:34:38,774
Sir, please.

662
00:34:38,775 --> 00:34:40,210
I know who
stole the ring.

663
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:44,376
You cannot do this, Shawn. This
wedding has taken over a year to plan.

664
00:34:44,377 --> 00:34:45,712
What are you doing?

665
00:34:45,713 --> 00:34:47,047
Radioing the Chief.

666
00:34:47,955 --> 00:34:49,011
I can see it.

667
00:34:49,012 --> 00:34:50,851
Chief Vick?
I can feel it.

668
00:34:50,852 --> 00:34:52,653
I can now feel the ring.

669
00:34:55,595 --> 00:34:58,496
It's in this room. It's in
the room. It's in this room.

670
00:34:59,966 --> 00:35:02,592
They wouldn't bring a stolen
ring to the ceremony, you moron.

671
00:35:02,593 --> 00:35:05,102
They would if they couldn't
get to it till today.

672
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,372
Lacey, I'm so sorry.

673
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:15,002
And believe me when I say, I really,
really, really wish it wasn't you.

674
00:35:16,014 --> 00:35:17,173
Me?

675
00:35:17,848 --> 00:35:19,372
Are you crazy?

676
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:21,910
I'm the one who's
done all the work.

677
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,247
Yes, you are.

678
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:27,255
And we're all very impressed, but it
was also an excellent cover, wasn't it?

679
00:35:27,256 --> 00:35:28,983
You are crazy, Shawn.

680
00:35:29,793 --> 00:35:32,694
And, by the way, we're
officially off for next Friday.

681
00:35:35,732 --> 00:35:37,527
Oh, boy! I can see it now.

682
00:35:37,528 --> 00:35:38,657
<i>You're at the dinner table.</i>

683
00:35:38,658 --> 00:35:40,064
<i>They're announcing
the engagement.</i>

684
00:35:40,065 --> 00:35:42,830
<i>You're thrilled, of course. You and
Bethany have been best friends forever.</i>

685
00:35:42,831 --> 00:35:46,671
<i>Dad... Dad has a surprise for
the happy couple. What could it be?</i>

686
00:35:48,444 --> 00:35:49,672
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

687
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:52,942
<i>You didn't know the ring
was going to Dylan.</i>

688
00:35:54,316 --> 00:35:56,782
You were always your
grandmother's favorite

689
00:35:56,783 --> 00:35:59,752
and you're the oldest girl.
That ring should be yours, right?

690
00:36:00,855 --> 00:36:02,015
Right.

691
00:36:02,756 --> 00:36:04,587
You were counting
on that ring.

692
00:36:04,588 --> 00:36:06,420
It was your future.

693
00:36:06,761 --> 00:36:08,091
Oh!

694
00:36:09,996 --> 00:36:11,552
Sorry.

695
00:36:11,553 --> 00:36:13,564
I can see you plotting.

696
00:36:13,565 --> 00:36:16,157
I can see you plotting right
there at the dinner table.

697
00:36:16,158 --> 00:36:20,070
But Dad...
Dad throws a curve ball.

698
00:36:21,907 --> 00:36:23,465
No, it was a slider.

699
00:36:23,909 --> 00:36:27,640
He's overly cautious because
sometimes engagements end.

700
00:36:27,846 --> 00:36:30,406
Not you guys. It's okay.

701
00:36:30,915 --> 00:36:33,611
<i>They're not letting go of
the ring until the wedding,</i>

702
00:36:34,452 --> 00:36:39,355
which means you have a very small
window within which to grab it.

703
00:36:39,858 --> 00:36:43,918
Does all this have anything to do with
why these two shouldn't be married?

704
00:36:45,363 --> 00:36:48,059
No, sir. No.
It doesn't at all, actually.

705
00:36:49,224 --> 00:36:53,099
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

706
00:36:53,403 --> 00:36:54,666
Oh, boy!

707
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,576
Of course, you insisted it be
used during the rehearsal

708
00:37:00,577 --> 00:37:02,132
so then you had your chance.

709
00:37:02,133 --> 00:37:07,615
While everyone else was fawning over
the ring, you made one final adjustment.

710
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:11,284
<i>It looked like you just straightened
it out and put it right back,</i>

711
00:37:11,285 --> 00:37:13,583
<i>but you never did, did you?</i>

712
00:37:14,756 --> 00:37:16,690
<i>No, Lacey,</i>

713
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:20,619
because you have magic hands,

714
00:37:21,262 --> 00:37:24,197
which I was really looking
forward to on Friday.

715
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:26,427
Everyone was fooled.

716
00:37:27,501 --> 00:37:29,900
<i>Everyone was fooled,</i>

717
00:37:29,901 --> 00:37:33,303
<i>except Dietrich Mannheim,</i>

718
00:37:33,741 --> 00:37:37,573
who hadn't yet discovered how to
use this information to his benefit.

719
00:37:37,574 --> 00:37:40,669
This is first-rate
fiction, Shawn.

720
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,270
Unfortunately,
there's no evidence.

721
00:37:42,271 --> 00:37:46,341
There would have been no evidence if
you could have gotten away that night.

722
00:37:48,354 --> 00:37:49,615
But there was a problem.

723
00:37:51,291 --> 00:37:54,885
Yes, you were called away.

724
00:38:00,766 --> 00:38:01,993
The florist.

725
00:38:03,534 --> 00:38:05,831
<i>The florist bailed on you.
The bouquets.</i>

726
00:38:05,832 --> 00:38:08,928
<i>You got a last minute
batch of materials,</i>

727
00:38:08,929 --> 00:38:11,098
<i>and the bouquets would now
have to be crafted by hand.</i>

728
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:12,538
<i>There was no other
time but now.</i>

729
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:15,475
<i>You looked for a way out,
but there was none.</i>

730
00:38:15,476 --> 00:38:19,105
<i>You had a $5 million ring that was
about to be discovered missing any minute,</i>

731
00:38:19,106 --> 00:38:20,740
<i>hidden in your palm,</i>

732
00:38:21,618 --> 00:38:25,177
<i>and you were gonna have to pull an
all-nighter in a room with eight other people.</i>

733
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:29,247
<i>You thought you could get back
into the cooler later and grab it,</i>

734
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:33,087
<i>but they kept
their flowers locked up.</i>

735
00:38:33,696 --> 00:38:37,529
So, you had to have your
specific bouquet, or else.

736
00:38:37,832 --> 00:38:39,732
Lacey, you're not
an unreasonable person.

737
00:38:39,733 --> 00:38:41,860
You're just a thief.

738
00:38:43,665 --> 00:38:45,831
Or at least you were a thief,

739
00:38:47,474 --> 00:38:51,068
until Dietrich Mannheim called and
told you that he was on to you.

740
00:38:51,069 --> 00:38:55,046
<i>He wanted a piece of that action,
too. Or he was going to the police.</i>

741
00:38:55,047 --> 00:38:58,107
<i>You tried to talk him down,
but he got rough.</i>

742
00:38:59,353 --> 00:39:00,751
<i>It got ugly.</i>

743
00:39:02,222 --> 00:39:04,747
<i>It was all spinning
out of control.</i>

744
00:39:05,491 --> 00:39:09,756
<i>Eventually, they were going to find
that body, so you started laying out clues.</i>

745
00:39:09,757 --> 00:39:12,730
You sent the police off
in all directions

746
00:39:13,766 --> 00:39:16,598
because you'd grown up hearing
all about crime scenes.

747
00:39:17,069 --> 00:39:21,767
I would say that's fortuitous, because
you knew just what to leave, didn't you?

748
00:39:22,807 --> 00:39:25,639
I have worked 18 hours
a day on this wedding.

749
00:39:26,143 --> 00:39:28,373
I have sacrificed
my weekends.

750
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:30,704
I will not be
treated this way.

751
00:39:33,951 --> 00:39:35,976
Then show us
your bouquet, Lacey.

752
00:39:39,256 --> 00:39:41,552
Whoa, whoa, whoa. She's
running? In those heels, really?

753
00:39:41,553 --> 00:39:42,818
We have to chase her, too?

754
00:39:42,819 --> 00:39:45,019
But we have no evidence
except for that ring!

755
00:40:11,552 --> 00:40:12,814
Dude, you're next.

756
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:27,488
Come on. You're still angry,
even after I solved your crime?

757
00:40:28,235 --> 00:40:29,531
Is this the man?

758
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:36,600
No.

759
00:40:38,077 --> 00:40:40,875
This guy was
not in my room?

760
00:40:47,085 --> 00:40:48,642
I've never seen him before.

761
00:40:48,643 --> 00:40:49,948
You got a room?

762
00:40:51,656 --> 00:40:52,782
Why?

763
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,827
We should have a party.

764
00:41:00,097 --> 00:41:01,690
Get out of my sight.

765
00:41:06,637 --> 00:41:08,228
Thank you, Bobby.

766
00:41:08,229 --> 00:41:10,431
Interpol appreciates
both of your efforts.

767
00:41:18,514 --> 00:41:20,947
I love weddings.
Don't you?

768
00:41:20,948 --> 00:41:23,449
I didn't exactly think it was
appropriate for you to give the toast.

769
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:26,247
Well, the best man was unprepared.
Someone had to step in.

770
00:41:26,248 --> 00:41:28,845
Besides, it was like a
practice run for your wedding.

771
00:41:28,846 --> 00:41:30,321
You are not gonna
be my best man.

772
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:31,949
You bet your ass I am.

773
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:33,960
I've already picked out which
song I'm singing at the altar.

774
00:41:33,961 --> 00:41:35,085
Really?

775
00:41:35,086 --> 00:41:36,653
You still like
Ted Nugent?

776
00:41:38,666 --> 00:41:40,656
Remind me to show you
your vows.

777
00:41:40,657 --> 00:41:42,133
They're going to
make you cry.

778
00:41:43,103 --> 00:41:44,195
Gus.

779
00:41:52,979 --> 00:41:56,675
<i>In between the lines
there's a lot of obscurity</i>

780
00:41:56,676 --> 00:42:00,149
<i>I'm not inclined
to resign to maturity</i>

781
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:03,448
<i>If it's all right
then you're all wrong</i>

782
00:42:03,449 --> 00:42:07,549
<i>But why bounce around
to the same damn song?</i>

783
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:11,291
<i>You'd rather run
when you can't crawl</i>

784
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:17,899
<i>I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth</i>

785
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:21,130
<i>I know, you know
They just don't have any proof</i>

786
00:42:21,131 --> 00:42:24,230
<i>Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend</i>

787
00:42:24,231 --> 00:42:28,402
<i>Your worst inhibitions tend
to psych you out in the end</i>

788
00:42:28,403 --> 00:42:30,070
<i>I know, you know</i>

789
00:42:32,015 --> 00:42:33,607
<i>I know, you know</i>
