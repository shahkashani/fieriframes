1
00:00:02,934 --> 00:00:05,094
Everyone stay
together, please.

2
00:00:05,095 --> 00:00:07,898
Our next stop
is the primate habitat.

3
00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:09,302
You hear that,
Trish? Monkeys.

4
00:00:09,303 --> 00:00:11,271
We're going to
visit your family.

5
00:00:11,272 --> 00:00:12,433
Knock it
off, Shawn.

6
00:00:12,434 --> 00:00:16,410
Now, some people believe that the
next animal we're going to see

7
00:00:16,411 --> 00:00:19,073
is the ugliest creature in
the whole animal kingdom.

8
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:22,244
Does anybody want to guess
which animal that is?

9
00:00:22,652 --> 00:00:24,982
It's definitely
got to be Trish!

10
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,112
I hate you,
Shawn Spencer!

11
00:00:27,113 --> 00:00:28,383
Shawn!

12
00:00:32,528 --> 00:00:34,357
I wonder what it is!

13
00:00:34,358 --> 00:00:35,919
Whoa.

14
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:43,033
Miss Bodansky, I think the
ostrich might be choking.

15
00:00:47,765 --> 00:00:50,205
Oh, I wouldn't
worry.

16
00:00:50,206 --> 00:00:52,642
I'm sure
it's just eating.

17
00:00:53,312 --> 00:00:54,471
Yeah, that's...

18
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:57,538
That's how they
swallow their food.

19
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,379
I'm pretty sure
that's not food.

20
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,086
A tennis ball, Shawn?
What are you thinking?

21
00:01:04,087 --> 00:01:06,418
What are you doing throwing
a tennis ball at an ostrich?

22
00:01:06,419 --> 00:01:09,721
The thing could have died, and the
zoo would have made me pay for it.

23
00:01:11,028 --> 00:01:12,995
I don't even know
what an ostrich costs.

24
00:01:12,996 --> 00:01:14,859
I didn't do it.
I didn't throw the ball!

25
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,728
Stop lying, Shawn. You're
only making things worse!

26
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,392
Maybe he's
telling the truth.

27
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:22,334
Are you, Shawn? Are
you telling the truth?

28
00:01:22,335 --> 00:01:23,803
Yes, sir.

29
00:01:23,804 --> 00:01:26,067
Did you see
who did throw it?

30
00:01:30,312 --> 00:01:31,608
No, sir.

31
00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:35,705
But I think it might have been an
accident. I think they meant to hit me.

32
00:01:35,706 --> 00:01:38,182
I believe him.
He's telling the truth.

33
00:01:38,183 --> 00:01:41,119
With all due respect, Captain, you
call the shots at work, not here.

34
00:01:41,621 --> 00:01:43,953
You deal with your kid.
I'll deal with mine.

35
00:01:44,391 --> 00:01:46,052
You, scoot over.

36
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:51,623
I believe you, Shawn.

37
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:07,840
Gus!
What?

38
00:02:07,841 --> 00:02:09,138
Gus, Gus, Gus, Gus, Gus!
Come here!

39
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,474
What?
Look at this.

40
00:02:11,081 --> 00:02:12,843
Isn't that...
Trish Connors?

41
00:02:12,844 --> 00:02:14,143
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
and her dad.

42
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,274
Whoa!

43
00:02:15,275 --> 00:02:16,612
Wow, she looks...

44
00:02:16,613 --> 00:02:17,743
Hot!

45
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:22,816
I was going to say vulnerable,
maybe a little upset, but...

46
00:02:22,817 --> 00:02:27,453
I mean, she was cute in high
school, but she sure has grown.

47
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,363
I wonder what Trish and Captain
Connors are talking about?

48
00:02:32,364 --> 00:02:34,093
Why don't I just
read her lips?

49
00:02:34,094 --> 00:02:35,691
'Cause you can't.
Sure, I can.

50
00:02:35,692 --> 00:02:36,827
Shh!

51
00:02:37,371 --> 00:02:39,565
"I'm sorry, father.

52
00:02:39,566 --> 00:02:41,800
"I can't fight
it any longer.

53
00:02:42,108 --> 00:02:44,770
"I love Shawn.

54
00:02:45,044 --> 00:02:47,136
"I'm in love
with Shawn."

55
00:02:47,137 --> 00:02:49,510
"Stop pretending to
be insane, daughter."

56
00:02:49,511 --> 00:02:51,013
Daughter? He calls
her, "daughter"?

57
00:02:51,014 --> 00:02:52,548
"You know you
belong with Gus!

58
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:57,110
"He's smarter and funnier,
plus he has abs like Bruce Lee."

59
00:02:57,111 --> 00:02:58,587
Whoa! Whoa,
whoa, whoa!

60
00:02:58,588 --> 00:02:59,679
Okay, okay.

61
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,950
If we're gonna do
the lip-reading game,

62
00:03:00,951 --> 00:03:03,083
we have to say things that are
at least remotely believable.

63
00:03:03,084 --> 00:03:06,287
I am.
"Abs like Bruce Lee"?

64
00:03:06,288 --> 00:03:07,761
Dude, they're
coming in!

65
00:03:10,867 --> 00:03:12,129
Act natural.

66
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:15,103
Hello?
Is anybody here?

67
00:03:15,804 --> 00:03:16,895
Oh, hey!

68
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:18,063
Shawn?

69
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:19,800
You probably don't
remember me...

70
00:03:19,801 --> 00:03:21,467
Don't speak!
Oh!

71
00:03:23,212 --> 00:03:24,609
I'm seeing
a face...

72
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,169
A face from
the past.

73
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,238
We know
each other.

74
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:31,341
Yes, we do.

75
00:03:31,342 --> 00:03:32,850
I said no speaking.
Oh, sorry.

76
00:03:32,851 --> 00:03:34,579
We were

77
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,951
classmates.

78
00:03:36,156 --> 00:03:38,316
Yes! Sorry.

79
00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:40,018
Did we ever kiss?

80
00:03:41,428 --> 00:03:42,415
No.

81
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,688
I'm sorry.

82
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:47,356
That image may very well be coming
from the not-too-distant future.

83
00:03:47,357 --> 00:03:50,765
I'm getting a
name. Connor!

84
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,233
Trish?

85
00:03:56,774 --> 00:03:58,831
Trish Connors?
Wow!

86
00:03:58,832 --> 00:04:01,308
Look at you! Oh, my
God! You look amazing!

87
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:03,106
What are
you doing down here?

88
00:04:03,107 --> 00:04:04,738
Wait.

89
00:04:08,317 --> 00:04:09,841
Why am I sensing
your father?

90
00:04:10,987 --> 00:04:12,045
Dad!

91
00:04:14,223 --> 00:04:15,779
Yes.

92
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,053
Captain Connors, it is so
good to see you again, sir.

93
00:04:19,054 --> 00:04:20,718
Please,
come in, guys!

94
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,386
Sit down in our
cushy chair!

95
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,987
Dad, you remember Shawn and Gus,
we went to high school together.

96
00:04:24,988 --> 00:04:26,532
I know who
they are.

97
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:29,264
That's
Henry's boy.

98
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:33,835
You don't have to speak to
me as though I'm a child.

99
00:04:33,836 --> 00:04:37,398
Now, the
reason that

100
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:39,376
we came
to see you

101
00:04:39,377 --> 00:04:42,072
is that there
is a...

102
00:04:45,817 --> 00:04:47,682
Um...

103
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:50,818
Dad, do you want me
to hold something or...

104
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:53,219
No, no, not
now, please.

105
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,452
I have to just...
Oh, damn it!

106
00:05:04,234 --> 00:05:06,759
Nobody breathe.
I'm seeing something.

107
00:05:10,306 --> 00:05:11,863
Gus.

108
00:05:11,864 --> 00:05:13,602
There was
violence.

109
00:05:16,144 --> 00:05:17,167
Murder.

110
00:05:17,168 --> 00:05:18,575
Yes.
There was a murder.

111
00:05:18,576 --> 00:05:19,839
Yes, exactly!

112
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,108
A murder, a 187,
and I solved it.

113
00:05:22,109 --> 00:05:23,810
You bet your ass!

114
00:05:24,618 --> 00:05:26,016
So, what do you
need us for?

115
00:05:26,017 --> 00:05:28,315
Because, damn it, I can't
remember who's been killed!

116
00:05:28,316 --> 00:05:30,912
Or who
the killer was.

117
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:33,549
Did you go to the police? Oh,
they're useless, all of them.

118
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,923
Without evidence, they
won't even speak to you.

119
00:05:35,924 --> 00:05:37,757
Thirty years I
spent on that force.

120
00:05:37,758 --> 00:05:39,797
But they still refuse to
believe me when I tell them

121
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,856
that there was a murder,
and that I solved it!

122
00:05:46,605 --> 00:05:48,663
But I'm having
trouble remembering...

123
00:05:48,664 --> 00:05:50,502
Actually,
remembering anything.

124
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,003
That's why I'm here.
To see if you could...

125
00:05:54,411 --> 00:05:56,173
Maybe you could
look into my head.

126
00:05:56,174 --> 00:05:58,476
See what
I can't find there.

127
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:01,781
But you believe me,
don't you?

128
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,653
Yes, sir.

129
00:06:06,489 --> 00:06:08,080
I believe you.

130
00:06:14,062 --> 00:06:17,587
<i>I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth</i>

131
00:06:17,588 --> 00:06:20,725
<i>I know, you know
They just don't have any proof</i>

132
00:06:21,202 --> 00:06:24,194
<i>Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend</i>

133
00:06:24,704 --> 00:06:28,697
<i>Your worst inhibitions tend
to psych you out in the end</i>

134
00:06:34,546 --> 00:06:37,571
So, your Trish says that
this is where her father comes

135
00:06:37,572 --> 00:06:39,173
every morning
for his coffee.

136
00:06:39,174 --> 00:06:41,445
He was here when he
thought he saw the murder.

137
00:06:41,446 --> 00:06:42,542
So?

138
00:06:42,543 --> 00:06:44,587
So, maybe we'll see something
that led an ex-cop to believe

139
00:06:44,588 --> 00:06:46,487
a murder had
been committed.

140
00:06:46,858 --> 00:06:51,156
Plus, double-chocolate
mango-pineapple scones.

141
00:06:51,157 --> 00:06:52,888
Apparently
made fresh daily.

142
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:56,330
What I'm saying, Gus, the
morning is essentially a win-win.

143
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:00,496
Oh, no!

144
00:07:00,497 --> 00:07:01,899
What?
Little "i"s.

145
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,733
Gus, little "i"s,
little "i"s. We gotta go!

146
00:07:03,734 --> 00:07:04,737
What?
Little "i"s!

147
00:07:04,738 --> 00:07:07,104
What about Connors? What about the
double-chocolate mango-pineapple?

148
00:07:07,105 --> 00:07:08,198
Forget the scones.

149
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,537
There's only one person
I know who makes the...

150
00:07:09,538 --> 00:07:11,238
Don't rush off
on my account!

151
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,568
Dad!

152
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:16,180
Shawn, you remember my old
captain, Brett Connors.

153
00:07:16,181 --> 00:07:17,614
Of course.
Captain Connors,

154
00:07:17,615 --> 00:07:18,878
how are you, sir?

155
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,513
Look at you fellas, all grown
up! How long's it been, huh?

156
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,182
About a day.
Less, actually.

157
00:07:31,464 --> 00:07:32,521
Excuse me?

158
00:07:32,522 --> 00:07:33,756
Yes, can I help you?

159
00:07:33,757 --> 00:07:36,629
I don't know. My
name is Sabrina.

160
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,690
Vito.

161
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,167
Sabrina Vito.

162
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:42,966
And I think that my
boyfriend might be missing.

163
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:46,475
He hasn't called and he
won't answer the phone

164
00:07:46,476 --> 00:07:50,501
and I'm a little afraid that
something might have happened.

165
00:07:50,502 --> 00:07:52,638
So, I've been putting
these up all over town.

166
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,411
It's okay. Why don't you
come over here and sit down?

167
00:07:55,412 --> 00:07:56,576
Okay.

168
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:57,676
Oh, that's right,
that's right.

169
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,482
That's right, this chick was
sunbathing naked in the plaza.

170
00:08:00,483 --> 00:08:01,545
No!

171
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:04,058
You should have
seen your old man

172
00:08:04,059 --> 00:08:05,956
chasing her
with the cuffs.

173
00:08:05,957 --> 00:08:08,722
This gal was so covered
with suntan oil,

174
00:08:08,723 --> 00:08:11,731
every time he grabbed her she
squirted right out of his hands.

175
00:08:18,004 --> 00:08:20,598
And that
reminds me of that 502

176
00:08:21,508 --> 00:08:24,203
that we picked up that New
Year's Eve, over on Olive Avenue.

177
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:25,469
How do you remember
all this stuff?

178
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,807
Ah, it's easy. Like
it was yesterday.

179
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:29,779
Speaking of
yesterday, Captain,

180
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,783
is this the table
that you always sit at?

181
00:08:32,784 --> 00:08:36,081
Because I'm getting
something here.

182
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:37,451
The murder?

183
00:08:38,123 --> 00:08:39,885
The murder?

184
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:43,859
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you were sitting
here when you saw the victim.

185
00:08:44,795 --> 00:08:46,557
Shawn, what are
you talking about?

186
00:08:46,558 --> 00:08:49,564
Shut up, Henry.
I solved a new murder.

187
00:08:49,565 --> 00:08:51,622
And your boy here's the
only one who believes me.

188
00:08:51,623 --> 00:08:52,724
Now, let the kid work!

189
00:08:52,725 --> 00:08:55,429
I'm seeing a man...

190
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,337
5'9", 5'10" tops.

191
00:08:58,338 --> 00:08:59,872
Shaved head.

192
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,464
Yes! Yes!

193
00:09:01,465 --> 00:09:03,703
Yes, yes...

194
00:09:03,704 --> 00:09:05,143
His name...

195
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,112
Mif...
Mif-you... No.

196
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:09,978
May? Mick?

197
00:09:09,979 --> 00:09:11,448
Mike!

198
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:13,146
His name is Mike!

199
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:15,648
He was arguing

200
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:17,518
over in the park

201
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,354
with that bastard
Mort Crocker.

202
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,627
A mountain lion...

203
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,393
He pinned it
on a mountain lion!

204
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,369
Now, if I can
just prove it...

205
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:37,065
All right, look, why don't I
play psychic here for a moment?

206
00:09:37,066 --> 00:09:39,472
It wasn't a young man.
It was a young woman.

207
00:09:39,473 --> 00:09:43,444
She's pretty. Brunette
hair, nice figure,

208
00:09:43,445 --> 00:09:45,446
she liked to play
Scrabble with her friends.

209
00:09:45,447 --> 00:09:47,642
Her name was Zoe.

210
00:09:48,552 --> 00:09:50,142
Yeah,

211
00:09:50,143 --> 00:09:51,516
you're right.

212
00:09:52,454 --> 00:09:54,285
That's who
was murdered.

213
00:09:55,624 --> 00:09:58,990
They said it was a mountain
lion, but they were wrong!

214
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:05,788
Dad, you're
amazing!

215
00:10:05,789 --> 00:10:08,266
Maybe my psychic
gift is hereditary.

216
00:10:09,436 --> 00:10:11,665
Shawn, Zoe Sharp
is a young woman

217
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:15,401
who was found dead 20 years
ago, mauled by a mountain lion.

218
00:10:15,975 --> 00:10:17,669
Connors and I
worked the case.

219
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,767
So, she was murdered?

220
00:10:19,768 --> 00:10:22,746
She was in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

221
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,576
A tragedy, yes.

222
00:10:24,577 --> 00:10:25,842
A murder? No.

223
00:10:25,843 --> 00:10:27,611
Not then,
and not now.

224
00:10:27,612 --> 00:10:30,745
Okay, okay, let's forget Zoe
Sharp, may she rest in peace.

225
00:10:30,746 --> 00:10:33,482
But Connors still saw the
guy on the "Missing" poster

226
00:10:33,483 --> 00:10:35,683
arguing with Mort
Crocker in the park.

227
00:10:35,684 --> 00:10:36,851
What?

228
00:10:37,127 --> 00:10:41,062
Shawn, we have no idea what
Connors saw or what he didn't see.

229
00:10:41,063 --> 00:10:43,188
The man is ill.
Early-onset Alzheimer's.

230
00:10:43,189 --> 00:10:45,665
His mind, the past, the
present, it's all screwy.

231
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:48,567
It's all the same to him. So, he sees
Crocker standing there in the park.

232
00:10:48,568 --> 00:10:50,126
It triggers an old
memory of Zoe.

233
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:53,299
Next thing you know,
he's living in the past.

234
00:10:53,942 --> 00:10:57,138
Dad, this guy's your friend.
He came to me for help.

235
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:59,405
Shawn, leave him be.

236
00:10:59,406 --> 00:11:02,915
He doesn't need your help to
make him look like an old fool.

237
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,214
He deserves
better than that.

238
00:11:15,595 --> 00:11:16,685
Shawn!

239
00:11:16,686 --> 00:11:18,251
Run, little alien!
Run!

240
00:11:18,252 --> 00:11:19,557
Shawn!

241
00:11:19,558 --> 00:11:20,655
What? You're gonna
want to see this.

242
00:11:20,656 --> 00:11:22,667
See what?
Look!

243
00:11:24,969 --> 00:11:25,957
Uh...

244
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,797
Coincidence?

245
00:11:27,798 --> 00:11:29,635
I don't think so.

246
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:35,541
So, when my dad said
he solved a murder,

247
00:11:35,542 --> 00:11:37,806
you think this is the guy
that was killed?

248
00:11:37,807 --> 00:11:39,108
Well...

249
00:11:39,109 --> 00:11:41,342
It seems like a simple
question, doesn't it, Trish?

250
00:11:41,343 --> 00:11:43,350
I'm afraid the answer is
a bit more complicated.

251
00:11:43,351 --> 00:11:47,788
You see, as a psychic, it is
important that I elicit the proper...

252
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:57,731
I'm sorry. Raise your hand if you
want to know how my amazing gift works!

253
00:11:57,732 --> 00:11:59,594
Gus, you're so
much better at this.

254
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:02,294
Why don't you tell
Trish how it works.

255
00:12:02,295 --> 00:12:04,768
I've got some
stuff I need to do.

256
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:05,861
Sure.

257
00:12:05,862 --> 00:12:08,930
The answer to your question is yes,
we do believe that is the victim.

258
00:12:08,931 --> 00:12:11,908
Please. So, what's
the next step?

259
00:12:11,909 --> 00:12:14,844
Well, being that
the authorities believe

260
00:12:14,845 --> 00:12:16,209
he was killed
by a mountain lion,

261
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,770
Shawn is going to

262
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:19,543
attempt to elicit

263
00:12:19,544 --> 00:12:22,108
a psychic link
with this suspect,

264
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:24,779
in order to establish
his guilt or innocence.

265
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,584
And by suspect,
you mean...

266
00:12:26,824 --> 00:12:28,724
The mountain lion, yes.

267
00:12:32,896 --> 00:12:34,055
Amazing.

268
00:12:34,056 --> 00:12:36,324
Not really, it's... it's...
It's fairly common for a psychic

269
00:12:36,325 --> 00:12:40,129
to be able to read different
species of the animal kingdom.

270
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,634
No, not that.

271
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:42,829
What?

272
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:46,305
The way that he's
sitting there so quiet.

273
00:12:46,306 --> 00:12:49,434
I mean, in high school
he was always so loud,

274
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,069
and needed
attention constantly

275
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,703
and needed
to be noticed.

276
00:12:53,704 --> 00:12:55,407
And he just
would not shut up!

277
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:57,814
He was so annoying.
He drove me nuts!

278
00:12:57,815 --> 00:13:00,613
But now...

279
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,586
I mean, look at
him, he's so...

280
00:13:02,587 --> 00:13:05,317
Calm,
so unobtrusive.

281
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:09,019
And the way he let you just
step in and take over like that.

282
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,290
I think he's
really matured.

283
00:13:14,467 --> 00:13:16,661
Yeah, yeah, he has.

284
00:13:17,736 --> 00:13:19,328
Dad!
No! No!

285
00:13:20,238 --> 00:13:22,000
He was mauled
by a mountain lion.

286
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,801
You don't find that the
least bit coincidental?

287
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,465
Of course it's
coincidental, Shawn.

288
00:13:25,466 --> 00:13:26,906
But it doesn't
make it murder.

289
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:30,207
<i>No, it makes it an episode of
When Animals Attack: Santa Barbara.</i>

290
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:33,270
Yes, well, mountain lions
do attack in Santa Barbara.

291
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:34,781
In fact, you watch
the news, right?

292
00:13:34,782 --> 00:13:36,750
That's your source
of psychic information?

293
00:13:36,751 --> 00:13:37,807
It happens.

294
00:13:37,808 --> 00:13:40,946
Connors came to me. He
says, "I solved a murder."

295
00:13:40,947 --> 00:13:43,490
Shawn, Connors
was a good cop.

296
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:44,922
And the thing that
made him a good cop

297
00:13:44,923 --> 00:13:47,051
is that he never
accepted the easy answer.

298
00:13:47,052 --> 00:13:49,528
But that doesn't mean
that he was always right.

299
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,188
Obviously somewhere
in his mind,

300
00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:54,028
he's confused something
that happened 20 years ago

301
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:56,160
with something
that's happened today.

302
00:13:56,771 --> 00:13:57,828
Okay, fine.

303
00:13:57,829 --> 00:13:59,929
Talk to me more
about 20 years ago.

304
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:03,408
How does Zoe Sharp
connect to Mort Crocker?

305
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,807
Mort Crocker founded the
Mort's family restaurant chain.

306
00:14:07,808 --> 00:14:09,176
He was the CEO.

307
00:14:09,177 --> 00:14:14,150
At the time, Zoe Sharp was his
assistant, and there was a rumor...

308
00:14:14,151 --> 00:14:15,412
A rumor!

309
00:14:15,413 --> 00:14:17,180
That they were
having an affair.

310
00:14:17,181 --> 00:14:19,188
Nice, that's
good stuff!

311
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:20,484
And Connors
knew about it?

312
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:21,683
Of course he knew about it.

313
00:14:21,684 --> 00:14:23,623
Every good cop makes it his job
to know about things like that,

314
00:14:23,624 --> 00:14:25,990
but there was never any
proof, Shawn. No proof!

315
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:29,998
And even if there was, somewhere
in some corner of his mind

316
00:14:29,999 --> 00:14:32,557
there is a memory,
a lingering memory,

317
00:14:32,558 --> 00:14:34,295
searching
for closure.

318
00:14:34,296 --> 00:14:38,430
But then he sees Mike here
arguing with Mort Crocker.

319
00:14:38,431 --> 00:14:40,940
Connors is not the most
reliable witness, Shawn.

320
00:14:40,941 --> 00:14:42,635
Dad, he's onto
something.

321
00:14:42,636 --> 00:14:44,870
One mountain lion,
two mountain lions!

322
00:14:44,871 --> 00:14:47,174
Mountain lions!
You're right.

323
00:14:49,417 --> 00:14:51,850
You should talk to
a mountain lion.

324
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:06,060
Whoa!

325
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:13,033
Simba! I am your father.

326
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,035
I don't think
Mufasa said that.

327
00:15:15,036 --> 00:15:17,903
<i>Ah, Mufasa, Vader,
I'm Not Rappaport,</i>

328
00:15:17,904 --> 00:15:18,998
it's all James Earl Jones.

329
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:20,474
<i>I'm Not Rappaport
was Ossie Davis.</i>

330
00:15:20,475 --> 00:15:21,704
It still works.

331
00:15:26,749 --> 00:15:27,942
We're not even
supposed to be in here.

332
00:15:27,943 --> 00:15:31,009
Relax. I love cats, and it's
been proven that cats love me.

333
00:15:31,588 --> 00:15:33,611
Well, this cat
likes to eat people.

334
00:15:33,612 --> 00:15:35,551
Here,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

335
00:15:35,552 --> 00:15:36,989
You're not going
to eat anybody...

336
00:15:41,562 --> 00:15:42,551
No!

337
00:15:43,131 --> 00:15:44,757
What's going
on here?

338
00:15:44,758 --> 00:15:46,561
Who authorized you
to be in here?

339
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,919
Uh...

340
00:15:52,472 --> 00:15:54,462
Please, excuse us.

341
00:15:54,463 --> 00:15:57,566
I am
Dr. Hans Jorgenson,

342
00:15:57,567 --> 00:16:01,204
and this is my very distinguished
colleague, Dr. Mc...

343
00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:05,208
Tock.

344
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:08,445
I am so sorry. I wasn't
expecting you until tomorrow.

345
00:16:08,446 --> 00:16:11,044
Yeah, we have
arrived early.

346
00:16:11,045 --> 00:16:13,055
Well, I'm happy
you're here.

347
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,148
I'm Joan Walker,
the zoo director.

348
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:16,954
Oh, let's see.

349
00:16:17,494 --> 00:16:19,051
Oh, look!
Dr. Hans Jorgenson.

350
00:16:19,052 --> 00:16:21,757
Look what they have
done for us! Dr. Mc...

351
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:25,095
Dr. Mc...

352
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,395
Tock.

353
00:16:28,396 --> 00:16:29,699
Dr. Mc...

354
00:16:31,171 --> 00:16:32,707
Tock.

355
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:34,867
Mmm.

356
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,000
Oh, what?

357
00:16:36,001 --> 00:16:37,270
Oh, it is nothing.

358
00:16:37,271 --> 00:16:42,178
You see, the Kosov language is
very difficult to master, yes?

359
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:47,311
It seems you have, uh, inadvertently
uttered a vile Kosov obscenity.

360
00:16:47,312 --> 00:16:48,945
Oh, I am
terribly sorry.

361
00:16:48,946 --> 00:16:50,079
Don't worry.

362
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,251
My colleague only speaks the
English at a very pre-school level,

363
00:16:54,252 --> 00:16:56,191
and he is very
forgiving of others.

364
00:16:56,192 --> 00:17:00,493
For instance, yesterday I poured
a hot cocoa over his genitals,

365
00:17:00,766 --> 00:17:04,531
and I say, "I'm
sorry," and it's fine.

366
00:17:04,532 --> 00:17:08,469
Now, is that
the man-eating lion

367
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:12,133
that we have
read so much about?

368
00:17:12,134 --> 00:17:14,143
No, no. He's
not a man-eater.

369
00:17:14,144 --> 00:17:17,304
No, no, if he attacked, it's
only because he was malnourished.

370
00:17:17,305 --> 00:17:20,940
So, tell us. Why is the
cat so malnourished?

371
00:17:20,941 --> 00:17:24,042
I really don't know. I mean, we
had record rainfall this year.

372
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,019
There's an abundance of foliage
for his prey to feed on.

373
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:30,182
He should be fat,
but he's underweight.

374
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:34,956
Perhaps it is because everyone
in California is on the diet?

375
00:17:34,957 --> 00:17:40,056
Yeah? All of the surfing
boys and the model girls.

376
00:17:40,057 --> 00:17:44,535
I mean, someone, anyone, please
give them a sandwich, yeah?

377
00:17:44,536 --> 00:17:46,730
Meatball, uh-huh?

378
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:48,205
What is that?

379
00:17:48,206 --> 00:17:50,173
The cat doesn't look
like it's eaten in weeks.

380
00:17:50,174 --> 00:17:51,504
Doesn't make sense.

381
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:53,340
Yes, this is Joan.

382
00:17:54,447 --> 00:17:56,472
Oh, well,
where's Dr. Zamfir?

383
00:17:59,084 --> 00:18:00,482
Actually, no, no,
stay right there.

384
00:18:00,483 --> 00:18:03,146
I might have someone
who can help us.

385
00:18:05,423 --> 00:18:07,582
Seems we have
a bit of a situation.

386
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:11,787
One of our warthogs is ready to give
birth, but our vet is away on an emergency.

387
00:18:11,788 --> 00:18:16,126
Could you please ask
Dr. Mc... The doctor,

388
00:18:16,127 --> 00:18:18,098
if, as a distinguished
veterinarian,

389
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:21,067
he would please help us bring
a new warthog into the world?

390
00:18:21,068 --> 00:18:23,367
Please excuse
while we confer.

391
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,605
Meercat...

392
00:18:40,254 --> 00:18:43,552
He would be
honored, yes.

393
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,314
So, just
lead us the way.

394
00:18:46,315 --> 00:18:48,361
Thank you, thank you.

395
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:50,318
What are you doing?

396
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:52,295
We don't know anything about
delivering warthog babies!

397
00:18:52,296 --> 00:18:54,854
Oh! A baby is a baby, you just
pull it out at the right time!

398
00:18:54,855 --> 00:18:57,833
The real question is, are
you allergic to placenta?

399
00:18:57,834 --> 00:19:01,133
Oh, God! My eyes!
My eyes!

400
00:19:06,544 --> 00:19:08,567
Again, Mr. Crocker,
thank you for coming in.

401
00:19:08,568 --> 00:19:10,202
I know how hectic
your schedule is.

402
00:19:10,203 --> 00:19:11,712
Don't mention it,
Detective Lassiter.

403
00:19:11,713 --> 00:19:14,979
I'm never too busy to help
Santa Barbara's finest.

404
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:18,310
Why don't you tell
me what this is about?

405
00:19:18,311 --> 00:19:20,617
Did you see this
in the paper?

406
00:19:23,259 --> 00:19:26,124
Yes, I did.
Sad.

407
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,320
We have information that you
were seen with the victim

408
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:30,090
the day before
his body was found.

409
00:19:30,091 --> 00:19:31,655
No, it wasn't me.

410
00:19:33,901 --> 00:19:35,561
Why don't we just
cut to the chase?

411
00:19:35,562 --> 00:19:38,298
It was that detective,
Connors, wasn't it?

412
00:19:39,406 --> 00:19:41,965
20 years and he still
can't let it go.

413
00:19:44,077 --> 00:19:45,772
I really can't say.

414
00:19:46,579 --> 00:19:48,512
Mike's body was
found on this trail.

415
00:19:48,513 --> 00:19:50,445
It's closed.
Now what?

416
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:56,310
Just hold on, let
me think a minute.

417
00:19:59,557 --> 00:20:00,955
Okay.

418
00:20:00,956 --> 00:20:02,457
I have a plan.

419
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,719
It's a
little crazy,

420
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,192
but it might
just work. Okay.

421
00:20:05,193 --> 00:20:06,354
What?

422
00:20:12,202 --> 00:20:14,932
Dude, we totally
made it. We're in!

423
00:20:15,738 --> 00:20:17,432
Shawn, in case
you're confused,

424
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:19,267
"closed" means,
"go away." "Stay out."

425
00:20:19,268 --> 00:20:22,002
Yes, in the negative
language dictionary,

426
00:20:22,003 --> 00:20:24,135
which is clearly the
only edition you own.

427
00:20:24,136 --> 00:20:26,304
But in the positive
language edition,

428
00:20:26,305 --> 00:20:28,848
closed means, "Come in,
step over the chain,

429
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:32,009
"there's so many less people to trample
all over what you're looking for."

430
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,211
You really think you
can track the animal?

431
00:20:34,212 --> 00:20:36,550
Perhaps you've forgotten
about my extensive experience

432
00:20:36,551 --> 00:20:40,558
with the Native Americans,
a proud and solvent people.

433
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,456
Working at the
Flaming Tomahawk?

434
00:20:42,457 --> 00:20:43,687
So, you
do remember.

435
00:20:43,688 --> 00:20:46,458
Shawn, you were a greeter
in the casino, for a week.

436
00:20:46,459 --> 00:20:49,295
The only non-Native American
to be awarded an eagle feather.

437
00:20:49,296 --> 00:20:51,961
Always remember that,
Gus. Oh, please!

438
00:20:53,138 --> 00:20:56,198
Black lab! Akita!

439
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:01,435
Lizard.

440
00:21:01,436 --> 00:21:02,773
Okay, now you're just
making stuff up.

441
00:21:02,774 --> 00:21:04,177
Flamingo.

442
00:21:04,882 --> 00:21:07,849
What if we do find these
mountain lion tracks? What then?

443
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,612
Well, we clearly follow them to
the kill zone and look for clues.

444
00:21:10,613 --> 00:21:12,711
What kill zone?

445
00:21:15,957 --> 00:21:16,946
What?

446
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:26,121
<i>Felis concolor. It's
Latin for mountain lion.</i>

447
00:21:26,122 --> 00:21:28,998
Let's follow them,
and see where they lead.

448
00:21:32,473 --> 00:21:34,132
This is it!
What?

449
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:35,673
The kill zone.

450
00:21:35,674 --> 00:21:37,073
The kill
happened here.

451
00:21:40,346 --> 00:21:42,278
Except...
Except what?

452
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:45,282
Except the drag marks are
coming from that direction.

453
00:21:46,185 --> 00:21:49,177
The lion tracks we
followed are over there.

454
00:21:50,555 --> 00:21:53,182
If this lion dragged
and killed its prey,

455
00:21:53,183 --> 00:21:55,588
the tracks and the
marks should match up.

456
00:21:55,589 --> 00:21:56,887
They should come from
the same direction.

457
00:21:56,888 --> 00:21:58,291
Gus, you know
what this means?

458
00:21:58,292 --> 00:21:59,384
The murder
didn't happen here!

459
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:00,394
Exactly.

460
00:22:00,395 --> 00:22:02,830
This cat was framed.

461
00:22:04,434 --> 00:22:08,369
I guess you guys can't
read. This area is closed.

462
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:15,168
What are we
doing here?

463
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:16,334
I'm burning up
in this thing.

464
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,843
No you're not.
Yes, I am.

465
00:22:17,844 --> 00:22:19,503
You've been wandering lost
in the woods for two nights

466
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,343
and you're suffering
from extreme hypothermia.

467
00:22:21,344 --> 00:22:22,815
Now, shiver!

468
00:22:23,818 --> 00:22:25,943
How are you
feeling? Better?

469
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:29,886
Oh, Ranger De Soto,
this soup is amazing.

470
00:22:29,887 --> 00:22:33,823
Gus called it a chowder,
and I'm tempted to agree.

471
00:22:33,824 --> 00:22:36,885
Do you think you might have
any crackers to go with it?

472
00:22:37,497 --> 00:22:40,022
Perhaps those
little oyster kind?

473
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:41,991
I'll check.

474
00:22:41,992 --> 00:22:43,659
You're too kind.

475
00:22:44,936 --> 00:22:46,027
Crackers? Really?

476
00:22:46,028 --> 00:22:47,764
For someone who supposedly
drinks his own urine,

477
00:22:47,765 --> 00:22:49,806
your palate is suddenly
very sophisticated.

478
00:22:49,807 --> 00:22:51,135
Let's get out of here!

479
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,470
We can't.

480
00:22:55,513 --> 00:22:57,173
We've got
work to do.

481
00:22:57,174 --> 00:23:00,978
I think there's more to this
gun-toting ranger than meets the eye.

482
00:23:03,052 --> 00:23:04,417
Like what?

483
00:23:05,822 --> 00:23:07,948
Well, for starters...

484
00:23:14,096 --> 00:23:18,053
He just happens to know the infamous
Mort Crocker and his wife, Edna.

485
00:23:18,054 --> 00:23:19,120
Coincidence?

486
00:23:19,121 --> 00:23:20,723
Shawn, it's
a fundraiser.

487
00:23:20,724 --> 00:23:23,031
The Crockers probably posed
with everybody in there.

488
00:23:23,404 --> 00:23:25,371
What about the
giant cage outside?

489
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:29,701
What about it?

490
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:37,709
I suspect that
at one point,

491
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:41,683
our man-eating mountain lion was kept
in that cage, and sustained a small cut.

492
00:23:41,684 --> 00:23:44,016
Yeah, when they trapped him
and took him to the zoo.

493
00:23:44,017 --> 00:23:47,079
Sorry, all I have is
saltines. Is that okay?

494
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,250
Oh, believe me, when you're
starving, you'll eat anything,

495
00:23:50,251 --> 00:23:52,385
including the poop
of indigenous beasts.

496
00:23:52,386 --> 00:23:55,589
Speaking of which, when
we were lost out there,

497
00:23:55,966 --> 00:23:58,160
Gus here was
little-girl-scared

498
00:23:58,161 --> 00:24:01,430
that we might be eaten by
some kind of wild animal.

499
00:24:01,431 --> 00:24:03,868
Does that sort of thing
ever really happen?

500
00:24:03,869 --> 00:24:05,964
Well, it's not unheard of.

501
00:24:05,965 --> 00:24:10,304
Fact is, we had a guy killed by a
mountain lion just a couple of days ago.

502
00:24:10,305 --> 00:24:12,969
Does that kind of
thing happen often?

503
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:15,743
Oh, a few times
in the past 50 years.

504
00:24:18,118 --> 00:24:20,085
I thought mountain lions
were afraid of humans.

505
00:24:20,086 --> 00:24:22,986
Generally, but if
they get hungry enough...

506
00:24:22,987 --> 00:24:26,115
We've had a really dry year,
that means reduced vegetation,

507
00:24:26,116 --> 00:24:31,129
and reduced vegetation means fewer deer
and the like for the lions to feed on.

508
00:24:31,631 --> 00:24:33,597
You can't really
blame the cat.

509
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:36,429
It gets hungry
and it wants to eat.

510
00:24:38,737 --> 00:24:42,068
You mind if I ask you a question
that's completely unrelated?

511
00:24:42,069 --> 00:24:43,231
Sure.

512
00:24:44,642 --> 00:24:47,042
Is that real
mahogany?

513
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,271
Now, what
do we know?

514
00:24:51,272 --> 00:24:52,746
We know there was
plenty of rain this year,

515
00:24:52,747 --> 00:24:54,146
no reason for a mountain
lion to be malnourished.

516
00:24:54,147 --> 00:24:55,774
Why was
Ranger De Soto lying?

517
00:24:55,775 --> 00:24:56,875
Why do people
usually lie?

518
00:24:56,876 --> 00:24:58,079
He's hiding something.

519
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,853
Henry Spencer
back from lunch yet?

520
00:25:03,993 --> 00:25:05,220
Henry Spencer?

521
00:25:05,221 --> 00:25:06,554
I'm sorry,
who are you?

522
00:25:06,555 --> 00:25:07,719
Never mind.

523
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,762
Just tell him
to come and find me.

524
00:25:09,763 --> 00:25:12,321
We need to go over
that Zoe Sharp file again.

525
00:25:12,322 --> 00:25:13,593
Whoa!
Excuse me, sir.

526
00:25:13,594 --> 00:25:15,635
You can't go
back there!

527
00:25:21,575 --> 00:25:23,634
What the hell
is all this?

528
00:25:25,211 --> 00:25:26,803
Captain Connors?

529
00:25:27,113 --> 00:25:28,205
Yeah.

530
00:25:29,649 --> 00:25:33,345
May I help you?
This is my desk.

531
00:25:35,754 --> 00:25:39,189
Look, son. I don't know who the
hell you are, but you're confused.

532
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:41,883
This is my desk.
It's been my desk for years.

533
00:25:41,884 --> 00:25:46,055
Now, you can either help me find
the Zoe Sharp file, or take a hike.

534
00:25:47,665 --> 00:25:48,859
You know what?

535
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:51,599
Maybe there's
someone we should call.

536
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,763
Hey, look, I don't have time for
all this crap. I've got work to do!

537
00:25:55,764 --> 00:25:58,032
Sir, please. Don't
make this difficult.

538
00:25:58,033 --> 00:26:00,437
Hey, you wanna
dance, pal?

539
00:26:00,438 --> 00:26:02,306
You just name
that tune. Come on!

540
00:26:03,011 --> 00:26:04,034
I don't know,
Shawn.

541
00:26:04,035 --> 00:26:05,669
Accusing Crocker of
murder's a pretty big deal.

542
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:08,043
It doesn't bother you that we're
missing things like motive,

543
00:26:08,044 --> 00:26:10,378
where the murder took place, or
any kind of evidence or proof?

544
00:26:10,379 --> 00:26:12,042
News flash, Gus, the
cops think I'm a psychic.

545
00:26:12,043 --> 00:26:13,983
I just have to get a
feeling at the right time.

546
00:26:13,984 --> 00:26:16,851
Shawn! Gus! What
are you doing here?

547
00:26:16,852 --> 00:26:19,083
My father,
he's disappeared.

548
00:26:19,084 --> 00:26:20,386
Hey!

549
00:26:20,387 --> 00:26:21,824
Come on.

550
00:26:22,028 --> 00:26:23,188
Where?

551
00:26:27,766 --> 00:26:31,202
All right, now you are starting
to piss me off, old man.

552
00:26:32,571 --> 00:26:33,901
Come here!

553
00:26:34,605 --> 00:26:36,163
It's time
for you to go.

554
00:26:37,108 --> 00:26:38,836
Henry! Henry!

555
00:26:38,837 --> 00:26:40,207
Tell them
who I am!

556
00:26:41,445 --> 00:26:43,969
Um... I think he's
talking to you.

557
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,114
Oh, God, please tell me I don't
look anything like my father.

558
00:26:46,115 --> 00:26:47,206
You could be his twin.

559
00:26:47,207 --> 00:26:49,183
Look at the back of my head. Is
my hair starting to thin at all?

560
00:26:49,184 --> 00:26:50,308
Shawn!
Henry!

561
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:53,219
I think we all
know who this is.

562
00:26:53,422 --> 00:26:56,015
This is Captain
Brett Connors,

563
00:26:56,016 --> 00:26:58,923
one of the finest
cops in the SBPD,

564
00:26:58,924 --> 00:27:01,324
someone I'd be happy to
share a squad car with.

565
00:27:01,325 --> 00:27:03,295
What the hell is
going on, Spencer?

566
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,729
This man happens to be
my friend, now let him go.

567
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:08,597
He's your responsibility.
Get him out of here.

568
00:27:10,604 --> 00:27:12,265
Let's go,
Captain.

569
00:27:12,806 --> 00:27:15,000
I should report them
all to Internal Affairs.

570
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:16,563
They should be
brought up on charges.

571
00:27:16,564 --> 00:27:19,941
I couldn't agree more. You head
home, I'll draw up the paperwork.

572
00:27:31,356 --> 00:27:33,220
That's
the girlfriend.

573
00:27:39,096 --> 00:27:41,087
I'm sorry
to disturb you.

574
00:27:41,431 --> 00:27:43,296
Was his
name Mike?

575
00:27:44,934 --> 00:27:46,400
Yeah, it was.

576
00:27:46,401 --> 00:27:48,130
How did you know?

577
00:27:48,404 --> 00:27:50,803
Shawn Spencer,
police psychic.

578
00:27:51,473 --> 00:27:55,876
I know that this must be
a very tough time for you.

579
00:27:57,513 --> 00:27:59,002
Sabrina.
Sabrina...

580
00:28:00,414 --> 00:28:02,575
I am so sorry
for your loss.

581
00:28:04,418 --> 00:28:06,749
You know, he'd
come all this way.

582
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:12,816
Lived so much, and his whole life can be
condensed into a few items in this box.

583
00:28:18,164 --> 00:28:20,654
Mike wasn't
from here, was he?

584
00:28:20,655 --> 00:28:23,030
No, no, he was visiting.

585
00:28:23,031 --> 00:28:25,933
Yeah, that's right. We
were both from Pennsylvania.

586
00:28:25,934 --> 00:28:29,269
Mike came out here to
search for his birth parents.

587
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:32,071
I am sensing
a longing.

588
00:28:32,072 --> 00:28:35,008
He was so sad the first
time he called me.

589
00:28:35,009 --> 00:28:37,875
He just found out that his
birth mother had been dead

590
00:28:37,876 --> 00:28:40,177
for almost
20 years.

591
00:28:40,178 --> 00:28:43,149
And that would explain the
sadness that I'm feeling.

592
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,584
But then a few days
later he called to say

593
00:28:45,585 --> 00:28:48,452
that he thought he had
located his birth father.

594
00:28:48,453 --> 00:28:50,581
I'd never heard
him more excited.

595
00:28:50,582 --> 00:28:53,752
Did Mike bring another pair
of shoes with him on this trip?

596
00:28:53,753 --> 00:28:56,058
No, no. Just what
he had on him.

597
00:28:56,059 --> 00:28:58,927
It was pretty sudden,
this trip out here.

598
00:28:58,928 --> 00:29:00,159
I see.

599
00:29:00,935 --> 00:29:05,599
Sabrina, I'm feeling that Mike
does not want you to be sad.

600
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,132
Can you tell me,

601
00:29:09,133 --> 00:29:12,302
did Mike get to meet
his birth father?

602
00:29:12,303 --> 00:29:16,336
He said he was a really wealthy
man and difficult to get to.

603
00:29:21,353 --> 00:29:22,342
Yes.

604
00:29:23,689 --> 00:29:25,849
Yes, he did.

605
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,558
A biotin deficiency
can be hereditary.

606
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:39,294
It's not exactly
a paternity test,

607
00:29:39,295 --> 00:29:41,199
but let's see if Crocker
has the same prescription.

608
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,759
If so, we know
Connors is right.

609
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,099
This is
a fortress.

610
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,230
We need a plan.

611
00:29:45,231 --> 00:29:47,399
I don't think we can exactly
just ring the buzzer

612
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,306
and ask to peek into Mr.
Crocker's medicine cabinet.

613
00:29:49,307 --> 00:29:51,867
Why not? That sounds
perfectly reasonable to me.

614
00:29:51,868 --> 00:29:53,674
Why can't we be
from the state board

615
00:29:53,675 --> 00:29:55,374
of medicine cabinet
inspectors?

616
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:56,677
I don't know, Shawn.

617
00:29:56,678 --> 00:29:58,377
I know I'm right
on this one.

618
00:29:58,378 --> 00:29:59,885
Let's think
this through.

619
00:30:01,021 --> 00:30:02,954
No, Gus. Come on, let's
go in without a plan,

620
00:30:02,955 --> 00:30:04,785
flying by the
seat of our pants.

621
00:30:04,786 --> 00:30:06,883
It'll be so much
more fun, trust me.

622
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:13,289
See, look, man. There's some
kind of commotion happening here.

623
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,094
Planning a party.
It's a piece of cake.

624
00:30:15,095 --> 00:30:17,600
They're never going
to notice us.

625
00:30:18,503 --> 00:30:21,130
Excuse me, where
are your badges?

626
00:30:21,131 --> 00:30:23,173
Oh, I don't need a badge,
I'm the event planner.

627
00:30:23,174 --> 00:30:24,706
The event
planner's a woman.

628
00:30:24,707 --> 00:30:26,241
Yeah, I'm her
assistant.

629
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:27,469
Also a woman.

630
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,908
To the
assistant.

631
00:30:28,909 --> 00:30:30,206
I'm calling
security.

632
00:30:30,207 --> 00:30:32,408
No, no, no, no! You
don't need to do that.

633
00:30:33,116 --> 00:30:36,017
Don't tell me what to do. The
rules are very strict here.

634
00:30:36,719 --> 00:30:38,880
Really? You're going to let your
bosses run you around like that?

635
00:30:39,322 --> 00:30:41,754
You're gonna let the
man hold you down?

636
00:30:41,755 --> 00:30:44,017
These freak bastards with
their rules and regulations?

637
00:30:44,018 --> 00:30:45,718
You're a human person!

638
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:47,727
You need to rise up and
tell them all to go to hell.

639
00:30:47,728 --> 00:30:50,355
We can all do it together!
Let us empower you.

640
00:30:50,965 --> 00:30:53,023
I'm Edna Crocker,

641
00:30:53,024 --> 00:30:56,899
and you are one minute
away from a squad car ride.

642
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,370
Probably ought to let
this one go. Yeah.

643
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,138
Hi.

644
00:31:08,139 --> 00:31:09,268
Hi.

645
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:11,781
I'm here to pick up a
prescription for a Mr. Crocker,

646
00:31:11,782 --> 00:31:12,838
Mort Crocker.

647
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:14,350
One moment, please.

648
00:31:14,351 --> 00:31:15,409
Thank you.

649
00:31:17,488 --> 00:31:19,887
See, you should listen to
me every once in a while.

650
00:31:19,888 --> 00:31:21,254
That's not fair.

651
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:23,759
I don't have access to medical
files and doctor's names.

652
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,623
Shawn, I called
two pharmacies,

653
00:31:25,624 --> 00:31:27,595
while you were
being interrogated.

654
00:31:27,596 --> 00:31:30,098
I don't have anything
for Mr. Crocker.

655
00:31:33,836 --> 00:31:35,496
Are you sure
about that?

656
00:31:35,497 --> 00:31:36,628
Yes.

657
00:31:36,629 --> 00:31:38,070
Um...

658
00:31:38,741 --> 00:31:40,901
Can I just get back
there for a second?

659
00:31:40,902 --> 00:31:42,840
I'm sorry, we don't
have anything,

660
00:31:42,841 --> 00:31:46,505
and someone has already picked up
all of his most recent prescriptions.

661
00:31:46,506 --> 00:31:48,275
Is it that bastard,
Jimmy Derukie?

662
00:31:48,276 --> 00:31:50,213
Shawn, please.

663
00:31:50,214 --> 00:31:54,117
I'll tell you what,
before I go a little nuts,

664
00:31:54,118 --> 00:31:56,519
why don't you just
give me the name

665
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,079
of the prescriptions and
we can get out of here.

666
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,283
Okay, okay, see, it's a
long-standing prescription.

667
00:32:00,284 --> 00:32:02,851
It needs to be renewed. No
one's gonna go nuts here.

668
00:32:04,294 --> 00:32:07,854
Okay, no,
I do have something,

669
00:32:07,855 --> 00:32:10,594
but they picked that
up over two months ago.

670
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,692
Really?

671
00:32:11,693 --> 00:32:13,134
What was that?
The penicillin?

672
00:32:13,135 --> 00:32:15,967
No, it was his regular
dosage of something called...

673
00:32:15,968 --> 00:32:17,063
Biotin.

674
00:32:17,064 --> 00:32:19,108
Yes, is that what
you're looking for?

675
00:32:19,109 --> 00:32:21,542
Yes. Thank you.

676
00:32:26,383 --> 00:32:27,406
All right, Spencer.

677
00:32:27,407 --> 00:32:29,850
You said you found an eyewitness
for Mike McMillan's murder.

678
00:32:30,053 --> 00:32:31,213
Where is he?

679
00:32:34,189 --> 00:32:36,179
Okay, Mike.
Go ahead.

680
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,419
Tell the detectives
exactly what you told me.

681
00:32:41,763 --> 00:32:43,526
You're kidding
me, right?

682
00:32:44,532 --> 00:32:45,897
And we're
out of here.

683
00:32:46,467 --> 00:32:49,492
Mike says he was in town searching
for his natural birth parents.

684
00:32:49,493 --> 00:32:50,967
If you don't believe him,
you can ask his girlfriend.

685
00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:52,299
That's true.
She told me.

686
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,601
Did she also tell you that
he found his birth father?

687
00:32:54,602 --> 00:32:57,039
Well, what about his birth mother?
Did Mike say if he found her?

688
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,133
No, no. He didn't
say anything.

689
00:32:59,134 --> 00:33:00,268
See, he can't.

690
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:03,338
He's a picture on a piece
of paper, and dead.

691
00:33:03,716 --> 00:33:05,546
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

692
00:33:05,547 --> 00:33:08,483
Mike said his mother
was killed 20 years ago,

693
00:33:08,484 --> 00:33:10,816
right after
he was born.

694
00:33:10,817 --> 00:33:13,915
Her name was Zoe Sharp.

695
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,689
I knew it.

696
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,590
That son of a bitch.

697
00:33:18,591 --> 00:33:20,993
He killed her and now
he got rid of the baby!

698
00:33:20,994 --> 00:33:23,157
He protects his business,
his reputation,

699
00:33:23,158 --> 00:33:24,630
and he doesn't have
to share his wealth.

700
00:33:24,631 --> 00:33:26,064
Sounds like a motive
for murder to me.

701
00:33:26,065 --> 00:33:27,362
Really?
Yep.

702
00:33:27,363 --> 00:33:29,461
Then how do you explain
the mountain lions?

703
00:33:29,462 --> 00:33:31,939
Huh? You're so smart?
How do you explain that?

704
00:33:33,308 --> 00:33:35,298
Lassi, why are you
asking him?

705
00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:37,606
He was just a baby when
his mother was killed.

706
00:33:37,607 --> 00:33:39,509
In fact, he wasn't
even there.

707
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:42,343
Summer of '86
was hot and dry.

708
00:33:42,344 --> 00:33:45,009
There were
a lot of fires.

709
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:46,677
Lions were all
going hungry.

710
00:33:46,678 --> 00:33:49,950
I remember some of them came
right into town looking for food.

711
00:33:53,626 --> 00:33:56,924
Crocker killed Zoe and
dumped her body in the hills.

712
00:33:56,925 --> 00:33:59,621
He didn't know about the
lions, that just happened!

713
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:02,633
They ate the evidence
and covered his tracks!

714
00:34:03,435 --> 00:34:04,662
He just got lucky!

715
00:34:04,663 --> 00:34:06,259
What about
this time?

716
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,803
With Michael, he
just got lucky again?

717
00:34:07,804 --> 00:34:10,772
No, not this time.
This time he had help.

718
00:34:10,773 --> 00:34:12,274
- Ranger De Soup...
- De Soto!

719
00:34:12,275 --> 00:34:13,934
De Soto provided
the lion.

720
00:34:13,935 --> 00:34:16,068
De Soto?
I know that name.

721
00:34:16,069 --> 00:34:17,874
I just can't
remember why.

722
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:18,971
Sir, it's okay.

723
00:34:18,972 --> 00:34:21,175
Well, I got to hand
it to you, Spencer.

724
00:34:21,176 --> 00:34:22,808
This is a
terrific story.

725
00:34:22,809 --> 00:34:24,249
There's just
one problem.

726
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,480
Sir, it's nothing that Mike
can't help us work through.

727
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,749
What is it? Crocker
has an airtight alibi.

728
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,347
He was in Chicago
when Mike was killed.

729
00:34:30,348 --> 00:34:31,722
Oh, he's lying.

730
00:34:31,723 --> 00:34:33,623
No, I checked
it out myself, sir.

731
00:34:33,624 --> 00:34:36,254
He spoke at a symposium in
front of 200 other people.

732
00:34:36,255 --> 00:34:37,388
No, no.

733
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:38,795
Not again.
Not this time.

734
00:34:38,796 --> 00:34:39,992
Hey, Dad!

735
00:34:39,993 --> 00:34:41,056
Sir!

736
00:34:41,057 --> 00:34:42,499
Daddy?

737
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,263
He wouldn't do anything
stupid, would he?

738
00:34:44,264 --> 00:34:45,827
Define "stupid."

739
00:34:45,828 --> 00:34:47,429
Go up to
Crocker himself?

740
00:34:51,043 --> 00:34:52,670
Trish, come on!

741
00:35:04,222 --> 00:35:05,450
Children, no running!

742
00:35:07,424 --> 00:35:10,120
Jane! So nice to
see you. You, too.

743
00:35:11,662 --> 00:35:13,060
How do
you do?

744
00:35:13,061 --> 00:35:15,495
Mort Crocker,
you're under arrest

745
00:35:15,496 --> 00:35:18,294
for the murder of Zoe
Sharp and Mike McMillan.

746
00:35:18,295 --> 00:35:21,200
Mr. Connors, I'm so
glad you could make it.

747
00:35:21,201 --> 00:35:23,397
Why don't you help
yourself to a drink?

748
00:35:23,398 --> 00:35:24,904
No, no, no, no.

749
00:35:24,905 --> 00:35:28,033
You might fool all of
these people, but not me.

750
00:35:28,911 --> 00:35:30,400
Is everything all
right, darling?

751
00:35:30,401 --> 00:35:32,571
Everything's fine.
Please go back to...

752
00:35:32,572 --> 00:35:35,114
Captain Connors, sir, why
don't you let us take you home?

753
00:35:35,115 --> 00:35:36,877
Pardon us for
the disturbance.

754
00:35:36,878 --> 00:35:38,384
Oh, crap!

755
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,445
Hey!

756
00:36:06,511 --> 00:36:08,067
Connors!

757
00:36:08,068 --> 00:36:11,046
Oh, come on! Stop
acting like a child!

758
00:36:16,152 --> 00:36:17,210
Dad?

759
00:36:21,057 --> 00:36:22,388
Bless you.

760
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:24,114
Thank you.

761
00:36:34,501 --> 00:36:35,763
Shh!

762
00:36:48,014 --> 00:36:49,071
He was here.

763
00:36:49,072 --> 00:36:51,546
Well, of course he's here.
We saw him come in, Sherlock.

764
00:36:51,547 --> 00:36:54,344
No, no. Not
Connors. Mike.

765
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:55,976
Mike McMillan
was here.

766
00:36:55,977 --> 00:36:57,042
What?

767
00:36:57,043 --> 00:36:58,849
But you sound
all muffled.

768
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:01,288
What are you
eating something?

769
00:37:01,289 --> 00:37:02,689
How can...

770
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:04,021
Right, right, right.

771
00:37:04,022 --> 00:37:05,824
My bad.
My bad.

772
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:09,456
He was muffled.
It was my fault.

773
00:37:09,457 --> 00:37:12,864
There. There,
that's so much better.

774
00:37:12,865 --> 00:37:14,698
Please get
out of here now.

775
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:16,964
I don't allow anyone
inside my greenhouse.

776
00:37:16,965 --> 00:37:19,563
Well, that's not exactly
true, now, is it?

777
00:37:19,564 --> 00:37:23,099
You let Mike McMillan
in, didn't you?

778
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,474
I mean, this is
where you killed him.

779
00:37:25,475 --> 00:37:28,708
You see, when Mike's spirit
started talking about Crocker,

780
00:37:28,709 --> 00:37:32,445
I thought he meant Mr.
Crocker, but it wasn't.

781
00:37:32,446 --> 00:37:35,954
He was talking about
Mrs. Crocker.

782
00:37:35,955 --> 00:37:39,322
Well, for your sake, you had
better be right this time.

783
00:37:40,894 --> 00:37:44,090
He came to see you,
but you weren't here.

784
00:37:45,264 --> 00:37:46,525
What?

785
00:37:46,526 --> 00:37:49,295
Mike, you know I
don't speak Italian.

786
00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:53,196
Shoes. He wants you
to check the shoes

787
00:37:53,197 --> 00:37:55,363
that he was wearing
that day. The soles.

788
00:37:55,364 --> 00:37:59,340
You'll find potting soil in the
tread that matches that stuff.

789
00:37:59,341 --> 00:38:01,138
Edna, what's he
talking about?

790
00:38:01,139 --> 00:38:03,270
Edna?
God damn it!

791
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:06,441
That's why I
know the name.

792
00:38:07,216 --> 00:38:10,776
Before you were married,
your name was Edna De Soto!

793
00:38:10,777 --> 00:38:15,720
And you and your brother John, the
park ranger, were in this together.

794
00:38:15,721 --> 00:38:18,020
He used the lion
to cover your tracks.

795
00:38:18,021 --> 00:38:22,153
You're not really going to
believe this old fool, are you?

796
00:38:22,154 --> 00:38:23,958
Watch who you're
calling... What?

797
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:27,329
I'm sorry, that was my fault, I
just wasn't paying attention to you.

798
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,698
Are you serious?
It's in a bird feeder?

799
00:38:29,699 --> 00:38:31,031
No, I'll say it.

800
00:38:31,032 --> 00:38:33,129
There's a surveillance
camera out front.

801
00:38:33,907 --> 00:38:35,999
Apparently
it's in a bird feeder.

802
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,474
If the tape wasn't erased,

803
00:38:37,475 --> 00:38:42,242
you'll be able to see him
arriving on the day he was killed.

804
00:38:44,216 --> 00:38:47,379
Please, Edna,
tell me you didn't.

805
00:38:49,987 --> 00:38:52,284
What was I
supposed to do?

806
00:38:52,285 --> 00:38:57,020
Someone had to protect everything
we've worked so hard for!

807
00:38:57,021 --> 00:38:59,823
You would have given
him half of everything!

808
00:38:59,824 --> 00:39:02,126
Just like you would
have his mother.

809
00:39:05,268 --> 00:39:06,860
He was my son!

810
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:11,630
Detective,
arrest this woman,

811
00:39:11,631 --> 00:39:13,435
and while
you're at it,

812
00:39:13,436 --> 00:39:16,533
issue a warrant for the
arrest of John De Soto,

813
00:39:16,534 --> 00:39:19,773
for the murder of Zoe
Sharp and Mike McMillan.

814
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,815
Officers, you
heard the captain.

815
00:39:21,816 --> 00:39:23,373
Get them
out of here.

816
00:39:31,692 --> 00:39:34,524
Dad, I'm so
proud of you.

817
00:39:44,002 --> 00:39:45,299
Showoff.

818
00:39:47,038 --> 00:39:48,629
Good for you.

819
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,434
Yeah, thanks.

820
00:39:50,435 --> 00:39:52,372
It's a real honor,
you know.

821
00:39:52,373 --> 00:39:55,002
I thought these days
were long gone.

822
00:39:55,003 --> 00:39:57,443
Does that mean you're
coming out of retirement?

823
00:39:57,444 --> 00:39:58,741
What, are you kidding?

824
00:39:58,742 --> 00:40:00,805
I'm lucky if I
come out of the fog.

825
00:40:00,806 --> 00:40:03,113
Well, you gotta keep
your brain stimulated.

826
00:40:03,114 --> 00:40:04,777
Try the crosswords.

827
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:07,151
Nah, I like that
Sudoku.

828
00:40:08,557 --> 00:40:11,650
Well, we could always
go after cold cases.

829
00:40:11,651 --> 00:40:15,163
Nah, best leave it
to the young guys, huh?

830
00:40:19,066 --> 00:40:21,363
Thanks for giving
him this day.

831
00:40:21,364 --> 00:40:24,767
I hope he remembers
it tomorrow.

832
00:40:24,768 --> 00:40:28,831
He couldn't let go
and move on, you know?

833
00:40:29,743 --> 00:40:31,836
Shawn?
Yeah? What?

834
00:40:32,612 --> 00:40:34,078
I'm sorry, I...

835
00:40:34,747 --> 00:40:37,648
A little... Little lump
in my throat.

836
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:42,315
Speaking of lumps...
Yes?

837
00:40:42,316 --> 00:40:44,514
The ostrich?
The tennis ball?

838
00:40:45,123 --> 00:40:46,316
What?

839
00:40:46,317 --> 00:40:48,688
You know what? It's not
a big deal, obviously.

840
00:40:48,689 --> 00:40:51,693
But it always
bugged me a little.

841
00:40:51,694 --> 00:40:53,456
Why didn't you
say anything, Trish?

842
00:40:53,457 --> 00:40:54,587
Like what?

843
00:40:54,588 --> 00:40:55,653
Oh, I don't know.

844
00:40:55,654 --> 00:40:58,392
"I threw the tennis ball into the
highly restricted ostrich area,

845
00:40:58,393 --> 00:41:00,367
"and I let you take
the fall for it."

846
00:41:00,368 --> 00:41:01,993
You're serious.

847
00:41:01,994 --> 00:41:03,936
It's not too late
to make it right.

848
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,968
Right is right.

849
00:41:06,876 --> 00:41:11,039
You really still have
not grown up, have you?

850
00:41:11,713 --> 00:41:14,375
Wow.
Goodbye, Shawn.

851
00:41:15,649 --> 00:41:16,707
Gus.

852
00:41:20,154 --> 00:41:21,246
What?

853
00:41:21,722 --> 00:41:22,984
Hey! There she is!
Hey!

854
00:41:23,691 --> 00:41:25,715
No, no, here.

855
00:41:26,593 --> 00:41:27,991
There, are
you happy?

856
00:41:27,992 --> 00:41:30,051
Yeah, actually,
I am.

857
00:41:30,052 --> 00:41:31,789
Good.

858
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:33,195
Good?

859
00:41:33,665 --> 00:41:36,724
You really want me to believe that you
put your foot in your mouth deliberately?

860
00:41:36,725 --> 00:41:38,064
Please.

861
00:41:38,804 --> 00:41:40,395
Go get the girl.

862
00:41:40,396 --> 00:41:42,665
It's your move.
No.

863
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,673
Listen, would you go...
Shawn, I told you.

864
00:41:44,674 --> 00:41:47,006
I do not need you to lay
back for me to get a girl.

865
00:41:47,278 --> 00:41:48,745
Get over there.
No.

866
00:41:49,113 --> 00:41:50,841
Show her the abs.

867
00:41:52,549 --> 00:41:53,879
Show her the abs.

868
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,009
Not until you challenge me
straight up!

869
00:41:56,353 --> 00:41:57,445
Fine.

870
00:41:59,321 --> 00:42:02,347
I will be
kissing Trish

871
00:42:02,558 --> 00:42:03,888
in 10 minutes.

872
00:42:03,889 --> 00:42:05,722
Not if I get
there first.

873
00:42:15,203 --> 00:42:18,603
<i>In between the lines
there's a lot of obscurity</i>

874
00:42:19,139 --> 00:42:22,266
<i>I'm not inclined
to resign to maturity</i>

875
00:42:22,267 --> 00:42:25,673
<i>If it's all right
then you're all wrong</i>

876
00:42:25,674 --> 00:42:29,010
<i>But why bounce around
to the same damn song</i>

877
00:42:30,283 --> 00:42:33,615
<i>You'd rather run
when you can't crawl</i>

878
00:42:36,588 --> 00:42:39,818
<i>I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth</i>

879
00:42:39,819 --> 00:42:43,222
<i>I know, you know
They just don't have any proof</i>

880
00:42:43,223 --> 00:42:46,262
<i>Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend</i>

881
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:50,458
<i>Your worst inhibitions tend
to psych you out in the end</i>

882
00:42:50,459 --> 00:42:52,192
<i>I know, you know</i>

883
00:42:54,037 --> 00:42:55,732
<i>I know, you know</i>
