00:00:04,464 --> 00:00:08,718
<i>Captain's log, stardate 41209.2.</i>

2
00:00:08,927 --> 00:00:10,094
<i>We are running at warp 7</i>

3
00:00:10,303 --> 00:00:13,640
<i>to rendezvous with the science vessel
SS Tsiolkovsky,</i>

4
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:17,936
<i>which has been routinely monitoring
the collapse of a red supergiant star</i>

5
00:00:18,144 --> 00:00:19,646
<i>into a white dwarf.</i>

6
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:23,441
<i>What has brought us here
is a series of strange messages</i>

7
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:28,863
<i>indicating something has gone wrong
aboard the research vessel.</i>

8
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:35,537
<i>SS</i> Tsiolkovsky,
repeat your message.

9
00:00:35,745 --> 00:00:38,414
<i>Well, hello,</i> Enterprise. Welcome.

10
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:41,292
<i>I hope you have a lot of pretty boys
on board,</i>

11
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:43,962
<i>because I'm willing and waiting.</i>

12
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,047
<i>In fact, we're going to have...</i>

13
00:00:46,256 --> 00:00:49,300
<i>- Boys?
- ...a real blowout here.</i>

14
00:00:51,344 --> 00:00:53,012
Do it, yeah, go ahead.

15
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:54,889
<i>Whoo! Ha-ha-ha. Do it.</i>

16
00:01:00,562 --> 00:01:06,192
Captain, what we've just heard
is impossible.

17
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:07,860
Report.

18
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:12,115
I believe that last sound
was an emergency hatch being blown.

19
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:15,577
Are you certain?
Yes, of course you are.

20
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:19,622
Data. Geordi. Tasha.

21
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:25,253
Sensor scans now reveal
no life signs aboard, captain.

22
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,283
Cover the ship as planned. Move out.

23
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:18,640
Indications of what humans
would call a wild party?

24
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:20,391
Yeah.

25
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:25,897
Their Bridge.

26
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,360
If this thing works,
be sure to record everything.

27
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,410
You were right.
Somebody blew out the hatch.

28
00:02:39,619 --> 00:02:41,746
They were all sucked out into space.

29
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:44,666
Correction, sir. That's "blown out."

30
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,209
Thank you, Data.

31
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:48,127
A common mistake, sir.

32
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:50,880
<i>Commander Riker, Lieutenant Yar.</i>

33
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:55,843
<i>Location, Engineering. Ten people
here, sir, all frozen. No vital signs.</i>

34
00:02:56,052 --> 00:02:57,095
Frozen? How?

35
00:02:57,303 --> 00:03:01,391
<i>Looks like someone has been playing
with the environmental controls, sir.</i>

36
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,894
<i>Just let all the heat bleed away
into space.</i>

37
00:03:09,482 --> 00:03:12,985
Sir, Lieutenant La Forge
in the crew quarters.

38
00:03:13,403 --> 00:03:15,571
Something in here.

39
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:49,147
Riker to captain,
I have a report for you, sir.

40
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:51,357
<i>Picard</i> here.

41
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:52,900
They're all dead.

42
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:54,861
<i>Apparently, some of them</i>

43
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:56,696
<i>were blown out
the emergency hatches.</i>

44
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,657
But there were 80 people on that ship,
Number One.

45
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:01,159
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

46
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:03,286
As I said,

47
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:05,580
all dead.

48
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,981
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

49
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:36,611
<i>These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.</i>

50
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:41,908
<i>to explore strange new worlds,</i>

51
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:46,704
<i>to seek out new life
and new civilizations,</i>

52
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:51,626
<i>to boldly go where no one
has gone before.</i>

53
00:05:52,645 --> 00:05:55,273
<i>Captain's log, supplemental.
We are downloading</i>

54
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,402
<i>the research information gathered
on the collapsing star nearby.</i>

55
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,697
<i>I'm concerned
at being in such close orbit,</i>

56
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:06,659
<i>but the Tsiolkovsky's research records
will no doubt predict the time</i>

57
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:09,036
<i>of the star's final collapse.</i>

58
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:11,956
I can't find anything unusual

59
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:14,834
in any of the tricorder readings
they sent over, captain.

60
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:18,337
Give me a theory, doctor. Anything.

61
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:22,550
Madness? Mass hysteria? Delusion?

62
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:26,554
Any or all, captain.

63
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,391
All right.
Let's bring the away team back.

64
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,978
Set the transporter
to maximum decontamination.

65
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:38,774
And then full examination
and observation when they're here.

66
00:06:46,324 --> 00:06:47,700
If you were any more perfect, Data,

67
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:50,369
I'd have to write you up
in a Starfleet medical textbook.

68
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:53,831
I'm already listed
in several biomechanical texts, doctor.

69
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,250
Yes, of course.

70
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:58,711
You're next, lieutenant.

71
00:07:13,142 --> 00:07:15,144
Normal, all across.

72
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:20,900
Except, why are you perspiring,
lieutenant?

73
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:25,571
I suppose because you have it too hot
in here. What else would it be?

74
00:07:25,905 --> 00:07:27,490
Doesn't sound like you, Geordi.

75
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:31,827
Heh. Well, maybe it's not,
maybe she threw her voice.

76
00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:36,624
Hey, it's a joke.

77
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,042
Of course.

78
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:43,047
But I would like to run, uh, one or two
more tests on you, lieutenant.

79
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:49,553
<i>Sickbay to Bridge.</i>

80
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,930
Picard here. Go ahead, doctor.

81
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:54,600
<i>I'm confining Lieutenant La Forge
to Sickbay until further notice.</i>

82
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:56,477
Do we have a problem, doctor?

83
00:07:56,686 --> 00:07:59,105
I don't know yet.

84
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,652
Data, I need help in locating
some library computer information.

85
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,987
Specifics, sir?

86
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:08,489
All I have is a vague memory
of reading somewhere

87
00:08:08,698 --> 00:08:11,534
about someone taking a shower
in his or her clothing.

88
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:14,078
Ah. The body Geordi discovered.

89
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:16,247
Well, I believe
it may have happened before.

90
00:08:16,998 --> 00:08:19,542
To someone, somewhere.

91
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,962
This ought to be easy for someone
written up in biomechanical texts.

92
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:30,261
About that, sir,
did the doctor believe I was boasting?

93
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:31,887
Probably.

94
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:34,974
- This may take some time?
- At least several hours.

95
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,810
But what I said
was a statement of fact.

96
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:39,353
Perhaps she will look it up.

97
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:41,689
You can depend on it.

98
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:33,074
Oh, my God.

99
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:42,958
Geordi.

100
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:52,259
Security, Lieutenant La Forge just
left Sickbay while I was in my office.

101
00:09:52,468 --> 00:09:54,386
<i>He doesn't have his communicator.</i>

102
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:56,806
<i>It is very important that we find him.</i>

103
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:58,974
Security team alert.
Pick up Lieutenant La Forge.

104
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:00,851
He just left Sickbay moments ago.

105
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,645
Captain, anything further'?

106
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:07,149
Affirmative.
Make it a ship-wide search, lieutenant.

107
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,635
It's a model of the same kind
of tractor beam our ship uses,

108
00:10:34,844 --> 00:10:36,178
with a few ideas of my own added.

109
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:40,224
So that's your science project, huh?
Wes, you're really something.

110
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:43,394
And since the captain
won't let me on the Bridge,

111
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,855
I use this to imagine I'm there.

112
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:49,441
<i>Take the helm, Mr. Crusher.</i>

113
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:53,279
<i>Set a course for 37, mark 180.
Warp 6.</i>

114
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:54,905
That's the captain's voice.

115
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:57,408
It's pieced together from words
he's used on the intercom.

116
00:10:57,616 --> 00:11:00,995
With this, I can pretend he's ordering
me to take the Enterprise anywhere.

117
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:02,788
And listen to this.

118
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:05,124
<i>Chief engineer, report to the Bridge.</i>

119
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,585
<i>Commander Riker,
report to the Bridge.</i>

120
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:10,629
<i>- Dr. Crusher, report to the Bridge.
- Ha, ha.</i>

121
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,922
What do you think?

122
00:11:12,131 --> 00:11:15,176
I think the captain's lucky
you're on his side.

123
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:18,012
But he still won't let me
on the Bridge.

124
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:20,681
And there's nothing there
I don't understand.

125
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:24,768
I wish I understood myself that well.

126
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,604
Are you okay?

127
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:32,860
No. Suddenly I seem
to be burning up inside.

128
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:37,239
It's so hot in here.

129
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,042
Geordi?

130
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:55,049
Geordi.

131
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:57,968
Lieutenant Yar
in the observation lounge,

132
00:11:58,177 --> 00:12:00,012
send a team here now.

133
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:03,057
- Medical's been worried about you.
- Help me.

134
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:07,937
Help me to not give in
to the wild things coming into my mind.

135
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,399
- Geordi, my job is security--
- Tasha, please.

136
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,195
All right.

137
00:12:17,238 --> 00:12:18,822
All right. Helping is more important.

138
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:22,534
- Geordi, how can I help you?
- Help me to see.

139
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:24,578
Like you do.

140
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:27,331
But you already see better
than I can.

141
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,541
I see more.

142
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,089
But more isn't better.

143
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:39,343
- Geordi, please, put these on--
- I wanna see in shallow, dim,

144
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:44,014
beautiful human ways.

145
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:53,232
We'll talk about it, Geordi.

146
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:56,568
Right now
I'm going to take you to Sickbay.

147
00:12:57,278 --> 00:12:59,113
All right?

148
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:01,282
Yeah.

149
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,325
Okay.

150
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,538
Good.

151
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:21,051
And then we got him down to Sickbay
so Dr. Crusher could examine him.

152
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:24,179
He wasn't violent?

153
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:27,891
No, sir. He was very upset.

154
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,978
He kept talking
about wanting normal vision.

155
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:32,771
Hmm.

156
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:35,107
Thank you, lieutenant.

157
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:51,749
According to our medical readouts,
there's still nothing wrong with him.

158
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:53,751
He looks like
he's running a temperature,

159
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:55,461
but every instrument says he's not.

160
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,880
Doctor, every person on that ship
over there died.

161
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:03,719
Is there any chance that
whatever did it is loose on my ship?

162
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:06,263
If you mean a disease, sir,
I'd say there's no chance of it.

163
00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:08,307
We used full decontamination,

164
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,601
we examined every team member
very carefully.

165
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:14,772
The entire crew somehow managed
to kill themselves, doctor.

166
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,900
If it's not a disease,
what else made them do it?

167
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:20,152
The obvious alternatives
are in the areas of insanity

168
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:22,071
and severe emotional upset.

169
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:25,866
Troi, do you feel anything unusual
in the lieutenant?

170
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:29,953
Security just told me
that he was longing for normal sight.

171
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:32,122
It's a sudden yearning for that.

172
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:34,333
Since his records show
no previous mention of that,

173
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,252
the fact that it happened now
could be important.

174
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:41,882
But all I sense from him
is confusion.

175
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:44,468
If I didn't know better,
I'd say he was intoxicated.

176
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,512
Our tests would have shown that.

177
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,847
Also any other signs of drugs,
hallucinogens,

178
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:50,641
or any other contaminants.

179
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:08,033
Can you provide more information,
sir?

180
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:11,453
Seeking an instance of someone
showering in his or her clothing is--

181
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:15,207
I know, it's like looking for a needle
in a haystack.

182
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,086
Why should anyone wish
to expend his time in such a search?

183
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:22,005
Correction, Data, I should have said
proverbial needle in a haystack.

184
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:24,007
Ah. A human proverb.

185
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:27,428
As in folklore, or an historical allusion,
or tribal memories--

186
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:30,139
Historical. That's it.
I remember I was reading a history

187
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:33,225
<i>of all the past starships
named Enterprise.</i>

188
00:15:33,434 --> 00:15:34,810
<i>Enterprise history.</i>

189
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,270
Aberrant behavior.

190
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:37,813
Medical cross-reference.

191
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:41,775
Captain, I believe we have the
answer to what happened over there.

192
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:48,198
"The Constitution-class
starship Enterprise,

193
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:50,784
Captain James T. Kirk
commanding."

194
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:52,244
Similar conditions.

195
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:55,205
They were monitoring a planet
that was breaking up,

196
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:57,624
and not a collapsing star,
as in this case.

197
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:00,335
But there were the same huge shifts
in gravity.

198
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:03,755
Which somehow resulted
in complex strings of water molecules

199
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:08,051
which acquired carbon from the body
and acted-

200
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:11,138
Acted on the brain like alcohol.

201
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:15,559
Data, download this information
to Medical immediately.

202
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,561
Aye, sir. Downloading.

203
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,605
Fascinating.

204
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:22,816
The entire crew going out of control.

205
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:25,402
Like intoxication, but worse.

206
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:27,946
Judgment
almost completely impaired.

207
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:32,326
Until they found this formula,
barely in time.

208
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:35,913
Picard to Dr. Crusher, come in.

209
00:16:36,497 --> 00:16:37,873
This is Crusher. Go ahead, captain.

210
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,833
You can relax, doctor.

211
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:43,378
The answer to all of this is feeding
into your medical banks right now,

212
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:44,880
including a cure.

213
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,632
Are you certain, captain?

214
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,842
Absolutely.

215
00:16:58,143 --> 00:16:59,436
Tasha?

216
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:03,690
What are you doing?

217
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:08,111
I need your advice.
That's why I came to your quarters.

218
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,031
- Of course. Anything I can do--
- On clothes.

219
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,493
You always wear
such beautiful clothes off duty.

220
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,829
And your hair always looks so nice.

221
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:22,167
I wanna change my image.
What do you think about this?

222
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:25,337
Or--? Or this one?

223
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:28,799
It's not for you.

224
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:33,554
Tasha, I feel you're very uncertain.

225
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:38,100
That you're fighting something.
What is it?

226
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:41,061
Never mind.

227
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:44,481
I'll find what I need myself.

228
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:47,442
Ship's stores will have it.

229
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,200
Tasha? Tasha, wait.

230
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:58,579
Troi to Captain Picard.

231
00:17:58,745 --> 00:17:59,788
Picard here.

232
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:03,208
Sir, I think
Tasha's been infected too.

233
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:05,419
<i>She just left my quarters.</i>

234
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:08,088
Counselor,
it's not actually an infection.

235
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:10,882
Yes, sir, it's more like an intoxication.

236
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:14,928
But whatever it is, she's got it.

237
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:16,972
Thank you, counselor.

238
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:24,187
Number One, it seems our Security
chief has the equivalent of a snootful.

239
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,857
Inquiry, sir.

240
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:28,859
Snootful?

241
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,071
Forget it.

242
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,700
<i>Snootful?</i>

243
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,792
Hey, Mom, look what I can do.

244
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:57,679
I've been able to widen
and strengthen the beam.

245
00:18:57,888 --> 00:19:00,807
- Just like I told you last night.
- Do me a favor, Wes.

246
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:02,934
There's something happening
on this ship.

247
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:06,271
Just to be safe, I'd like you to stay
in our quarters until it's solved.

248
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,440
Sure, Mom. Sure.

249
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:09,858
Your wish is my command.

250
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:11,276
Now, Wes.

251
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:16,531
Okay. But you could be stunting
my emotional growth. You realize that?

252
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,158
Why's it so hot in here, anyway?

253
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:20,619
<i>Picard</i> to Crusher.

254
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:24,665
Crusher here.

255
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:26,500
<i>Have you made a test injection yet?</i>

256
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:30,170
<i>We're getting indications
that this condition is spreading.</i>

257
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:34,383
No test yet, captain, but very soon.

258
00:19:57,406 --> 00:20:00,033
Captain, another 41 minutes
will see the information

259
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:02,285
from the Tsiolkovsky
downloaded to us.

260
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:04,496
Why so slow?

261
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:07,582
Slow, sir?

262
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:11,002
The Tsiolkovsky has been
eight months in accumulating it.

263
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:14,339
How much danger from that star?
Worst case.

264
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:17,551
Like a full collapse, sir?

265
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:19,594
Any stellar material it threw this way,

266
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:22,222
we could still outrun
on half impulse power.

267
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,984
<i>Picard</i> to Engineering.

268
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:37,487
<i>Chief engineer, report to the Bridge.</i>

269
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:49,916
<i>Assistant Chief Engineer Shimoda,
report to Medical.</i>

270
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,045
- Hi, Jim.
- Oh.

271
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:56,006
Was that the captain
ordering you to Medical?

272
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:58,091
Which would leave no one
here on duty.

273
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,260
The chief was just summoned
to the Bridge.

274
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:01,678
What about me?

275
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:04,890
I could call the chief on the Bridge
if anything happened.

276
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:20,155
Reporting as ordered, sir.

277
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:22,157
What?

278
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:24,993
You ordered me
to report to the Bridge, sir.

279
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:27,829
I did no such thing.
I want you down in the Engine Room,

280
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:30,165
just in case we need
to move out of here.

281
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:31,458
Uh...

282
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,877
Attention, all <i>decks.</i>

<i>Effective immediately,</i>

284
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,881
<i>I have handed over control

<i>to Acting Captain Wesley Crusher.</i>

00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:42,803
Acting captain?

287
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:45,847
Thank you, Captain Picard. <i>Thank</i> you.

288
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:49,142
<i>And with that order dawns
a brave new day for the Enterprise.</i>

<i>of the Tsiolkovsky crew

00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:23,260
- Hurray for the acting captain.
- All right.

297
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:30,433
I never got as far as Sickbay, Wes.
I feel too good for that.

298
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:40,735
Incredible. How did you do that?

299
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:43,446
Hooked my model tractor beam
into ship's power.

300
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:46,074
Now it's a repulser beam too.

301
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:47,450
Want in?

302
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:51,329
I swear to be faithful to you, captain.

303
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:07,178
Number One, MacDougal,
get that boy out of Engineering.

304
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:14,978
Sir, I'm getting very strange reports
from all decks.

305
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:16,229
Such as?

306
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:18,690
Such as the ship's training division
ordering all officers

307
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:21,026
to attend a lecture
on metaphysics.

308
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:22,319
Metaphysics?

309
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:24,446
Confirmed, sir.

310
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:27,532
And there was
a rather peculiar limerick

311
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:30,285
being delivered by someone
in the shuttlecraft bay.

312
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:33,914
I am not sure I understand it.

313
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:39,252
<i>There was a young lady from Venus
Whose body was shaped like a--</i>

314
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:41,421
Captain to Security, come in.

315
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,341
Did I say something wrong?

316
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:46,426
I don't understand
their humor either.

317
00:23:46,635 --> 00:23:47,969
Ha, ha. Yeah?

318
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:50,180
Where is my security chief?
Get me Lieutenant Yar.

319
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:51,556
<i>Keep your britches on--</i>

320
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:53,475
Captain Picard.

321
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:55,060
Lieutenant, where are you?

322
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:57,145
<i>Ha-ha-ha. I'm in my quarters,</i>

323
00:23:57,312 --> 00:24:01,066
<i>and, um, I'm pretty busy
right at the moment,</i>

324
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:04,069
<i>Jean-Luc.</i>

325
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:09,115
All right, lieutenant,
you just stay right there.

326
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:11,743
Data, go to Lieutenant Yar,
take her down to Sickbay.

327
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:13,161
Yes, sir.

328
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,704
Captain to Security.

329
00:24:14,913 --> 00:24:19,167
I want all your senior supervisors
to report to the Bridge immediately.

330
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:32,389
Lieutenant Yar?

331
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:34,808
Here, Data.

332
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:40,855
You wanted me?

333
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:50,365
Captain Picard ordered me
to escort you to Sickbay, lieutenant.

334
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:52,867
Did he say when?

335
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,246
I'm sure he meant now.

336
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:59,624
So you should get into uniform.

337
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:03,378
Tsk. But I got out of my uniform
for you, Data.

338
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:08,675
Do you know how old I was
when I was abandoned?

339
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:10,677
Chronological age?

340
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:12,137
No.

341
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:15,974
- I'm afraid I am not familiar with--
- Five.

342
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:18,476
Five years old.

343
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:20,895
But I survived.

344
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:27,235
I learned how to stay alive,
how to avoid the rape gangs.

345
00:25:27,652 --> 00:25:30,071
I was 15 before I escaped.

346
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:34,617
I am sorry. I did not know.

347
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:38,747
And what I want now is gentleness.

348
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,957
And joy.

349
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:43,918
And love.

350
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:46,838
From you, Data.
You are fully functional, aren't you?

351
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:49,257
- Of course, but--
- How fully?

352
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:51,217
In every way, of course.

353
00:25:51,426 --> 00:25:54,429
I am programmed
in multiple techniques.

354
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:58,600
- A broad variety of pleasuring.
- Oh.

355
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:02,896
You jewel.
That's exactly what I hoped.

356
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:14,991
What have you learned?

357
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,786
Captain, the ship's engines are cut off
from the Bridge.

358
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:19,871
The assistant chief engineer
has pulled out

359
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,040
the isolinear optical chips
from command.

360
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:24,125
All the engines are off-line.

361
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:28,588
Wesley has hooked up some kind
of tractor beam to the ship's power.

362
00:26:28,797 --> 00:26:30,298
He has it aimed at the door.

363
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,760
And we can't get past
to get to the computer.

364
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:35,762
Can you short out the power?

365
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:39,849
Yes, I can.
But it's gonna take some time.

366
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:41,476
Do it.

367
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:47,273
Bill?

368
00:26:51,903 --> 00:26:53,988
Deanna, what?

369
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:57,867
So many minds on this ship,

370
00:26:58,076 --> 00:26:59,869
all free.

371
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:02,372
Released.

372
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,748
Deanna.

373
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:07,377
I can feel them all.

374
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:11,965
What they want, what they feel.

375
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:17,178
It's a side of humans
I never felt before.

376
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:21,808
Come on. I'm getting you to Sickbay.

377
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:27,230
Wouldn't you rather be alone with me?
With me in your mind?

378
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:44,873
The medical records we found
say this works almost instantly.

379
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:53,381
It's not fair, doc.

380
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:56,676
I've never seen a rainbow,

381
00:27:56,885 --> 00:27:59,971
a sunset, sunrise.

382
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:03,141
This is gonna help me?

383
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:06,102
Help me see like you?

384
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:15,945
Dr. Crusher?

385
00:28:23,286 --> 00:28:24,454
Deanna needs your help.

386
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:26,956
The formula from the old Enterprise
didn't work.

387
00:28:27,165 --> 00:28:28,625
- What?
- This water-carbon complex

388
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:32,086
may induce the same symptoms,
but somehow it's different.

389
00:28:32,295 --> 00:28:36,216
Maybe it's mutated. But I've got
to isolate it in order to analyze it.

390
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:38,760
- We don't have that kind of time.
- You brought Deanna in?

391
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:41,095
- Yes, she's infected with it.
- You touched her.

392
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:43,640
Oh, God, and you touched me.

393
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,643
I've gotta quarantine you.

394
00:28:46,851 --> 00:28:48,895
If I don't get the command computer
back online soon,

395
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:51,397
none of this, whatever this is,
will matter.

396
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:53,608
We'll all be dead.

397
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:04,494
<i>Captain's log, supplemental.</i>

398
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:08,581
<i>It is no longer an inconvenient,
childish prank.</i>

399
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,291
<i>Young Wesley Crusher,</i>

400
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,503
<i>admittedly a victim
of the Tsiolkovsky infection,</i>

401
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:17,257
<i>is now in control of my starship.</i>

402
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:20,093
Wesley? This is Captain Picard.

403
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:22,428
- Do you see me?
- Yes, sir.

404
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:25,431
You will now return control
of this vessel

405
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,643
to the Bridge, where it belongs.
At once.

406
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:30,270
<i>I'm sorry, sir.</i>

407
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:32,855
<i>Why don't you just tell me
what you want done and I'll do it?</i>

408
00:29:33,064 --> 00:29:36,192
Because ship captains
control their own vessels, young man.

409
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:38,569
<i>But, sir, you don't do it yourself.</i>

410
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:41,531
<i>You give the orders,
but somebody else does it.</i>

411
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:43,574
<i>What's wrong with giving me
the orders to do it?</i>

412
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:48,246
Captain, getting unusual readings now
from the dwarf star.

413
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:49,956
Stand by on that for a moment.

414
00:29:50,665 --> 00:29:52,375
Wesley.

415
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:55,253
Wes.

416
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:58,881
Are you aware
that you are behaving strangely?

417
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:05,305
That a kind of infection was brought
over from the Tsiolkovsky

418
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:09,309
which acts like intoxication?

419
00:30:09,517 --> 00:30:13,604
<i>Are you saying that's why
I feel so hot? So strange?</i>

420
00:30:13,813 --> 00:30:15,023
That's...

421
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:18,860
That's a very adult bit of reasoning,
Wesley.

422
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:21,279
<i>So you mean I'm drunk.</i>

423
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:23,698
<i>I feel strange but also good.</i>

424
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:24,949
Because...

425
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:29,912
Because you have lost the capacity
for self-judgment.

426
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:32,498
Now, alcohol does this, Wesley,

427
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:35,335
but the contaminant we brought back
from the Tsiolkovsky

428
00:30:35,543 --> 00:30:37,295
does it even more so.

429
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:40,798
<i>What would you do
if you got your ship back?</i>

430
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:43,926
Oh, it's very important I do, Wesley.

431
00:30:44,135 --> 00:30:47,055
Because I must immediately
lock a tractor beam

432
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:48,890
<i>onto the Tsiolkovsky
and tow it out of--</i>

433
00:30:49,307 --> 00:30:50,850
<i>Tractor beams are my specialty,
skipper.</i>

434
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:53,686
<i>I'll contact you when that's done.
Wesley out.</i>

435
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:56,105
Wesley?

436
00:30:56,314 --> 00:30:57,648
Wesley?

437
00:31:01,736 --> 00:31:03,529
Conn, where are you headed?

438
00:31:03,738 --> 00:31:05,531
Sir, the star.

439
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,367
It's beginning to collapse.

440
00:31:14,165 --> 00:31:17,627
What the hell is happening
in Engineering?

441
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:21,214
Lock on.

442
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,675
<i>Lock on, Tsiolkovsky.</i>

443
00:31:24,884 --> 00:31:26,803
Lock on.

444
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:31,974
- Where's that sonic driver?
- It's over there.

445
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:39,899
Okay. Let's see if this
cuts out his tractor-beam power.

446
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:46,989
Come on.

447
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:52,620
Oh, no. No.

448
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:58,251
I must find the answer.
I've got to find the answer.

449
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:09,846
Captain, tractor beam.
We just locked onto the Tsiolkovsky.

450
00:32:10,054 --> 00:32:11,889
Captain to--

451
00:32:13,266 --> 00:32:16,310
Wesley. Wesley Crusher, come in.

452
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:18,771
Ah, good, Data.

453
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:24,861
- At least you're functioning.
- Fully, captain.

454
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:30,825
Data, intoxication
is a human condition.

455
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:34,287
Your brain is different,
it's not the same as--

456
00:32:34,495 --> 00:32:39,333
We are more alike than unlike,
my dear captain.

457
00:32:40,293 --> 00:32:42,086
I have pores.

458
00:32:42,295 --> 00:32:43,880
Humans have pores.

459
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:48,384
I have fingerprints.

460
00:32:48,593 --> 00:32:50,720
Humans have fingerprints.

461
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:54,515
My chemical nutrients
are like your blood.

462
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:57,727
If you prick me,

463
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:01,772
do I not leak?

464
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:05,985
- Doctor--
Captain,

465
00:33:06,194 --> 00:33:09,197
can I see you in your Ready Room?
It's a private matter.

466
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:11,282
No, actually, it's an urgent one.

467
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:12,867
But--

468
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:17,121
Damn it.

469
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,503
Now, doctor--

470
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:26,172
I believe I've become infected myself,
captain.

471
00:33:26,589 --> 00:33:28,257
Do you know what the infection is?

472
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:32,553
- Come on, quickly.
- Ha, ha-- Sorry.

473
00:33:32,762 --> 00:33:37,975
It is definitely like alcohol intoxication.
The same lack of good judgment.

474
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:40,061
For example,

475
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:46,317
right now I find you extremely,
extremely...

476
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:49,445
Of course,
we haven't time for that sort of thing.

477
00:33:49,654 --> 00:33:53,950
- What sort of thing?
- Oh, God, would I love to show you.

478
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:58,246
Doctor, there must be a cure.
Some formula.

479
00:34:00,957 --> 00:34:02,416
Similar to the old one.

480
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:05,628
Damn it, damn it, captain.

481
00:34:06,254 --> 00:34:10,341
My dear captain.

482
00:34:11,676 --> 00:34:13,678
You owe me something.

483
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:16,097
You do realize that, don't you?

484
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:17,848
I'm a woman.

485
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:22,645
I haven't had the comfort
of a husband, a man.

486
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,359
Not now, doctor.

487
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:30,444
Please.

488
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:44,917
- Bridge to Riker. Urgent.
- Riker here.

489
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:49,922
Sir, regret to inform you
that the captain appears to be infected.

490
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:51,299
And Data.

491
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:53,884
Thank you, lieutenant,
I'm on my way.

492
00:34:54,093 --> 00:34:55,469
You'll have to handle this.

493
00:34:55,678 --> 00:34:58,514
Are you saying
you're gonna handle that?

494
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,653
What we're seeing, sir,

495
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:15,823
is a huge chunk of the star's surface
blown away,

496
00:35:16,032 --> 00:35:17,325
heading for us.

497
00:35:19,452 --> 00:35:21,329
Take us...

498
00:35:21,704 --> 00:35:23,664
Are you all right, sir?

499
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:28,628
Worf, you do know what to do.
Take us, uh...

500
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:31,839
- Take us out of here.
- Right.

501
00:35:43,768 --> 00:35:46,687
- Controls are still off-line, sir.
- Override.

502
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:52,109
Same result, sir.

503
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:01,661
<i>Wes, come in, please.</i>

504
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,997
Wesley Crusher, this is Riker.

505
00:36:05,206 --> 00:36:08,209
<i>This is urgent. Come in, please.</i>

506
00:36:17,218 --> 00:36:21,138
<i>Engineering, urgent.
We must have ship's power.</i>

507
00:36:22,473 --> 00:36:25,184
These are control chips.

508
00:36:31,357 --> 00:36:32,733
Bridge from Engineering.

509
00:36:32,942 --> 00:36:34,527
The star is still collapsing.

510
00:36:34,735 --> 00:36:36,987
<i>- We're directly in the path--
- I can't help you, Bridge.</i>

511
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:39,323
Someone here has yanked out
all the control chips.

512
00:36:39,532 --> 00:36:41,075
It was an adult who did it.

513
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:45,121
Sir, I estimate 14 minutes
until that mass gets here.

514
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:47,748
<i>No way. I cannot
replace these chips in 14 minutes</i>

515
00:36:47,915 --> 00:36:50,418
Two hours, three, maybe.

516
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:52,712
Data could assemble them
back faster.

517
00:36:54,505 --> 00:36:58,300
What? What's that?
What's that, Wesley?

518
00:36:58,509 --> 00:37:01,345
Well, they're just simple isolinear
chips, sir. To Data, anyway.

519
00:37:01,554 --> 00:37:03,639
<i>He could shuffle them like cards.</i>

520
00:37:03,848 --> 00:37:06,183
Come on, Data, hurry.

521
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:15,901
<i>Ship's log, First Officer Riker.
Enterprise will be destroyed</i>

522
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:19,947
<i>unless it can be moved out of the path
of the star material hurtling toward us.</i>

523
00:37:20,156 --> 00:37:22,408
<i>Our only hope is
for Lieutenant Commander Data,</i>

524
00:37:22,616 --> 00:37:23,701
<i>in the time we have left,</i>

525
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:27,204
<i>to regain his senses and reconnect
engine power to the Bridge.</i>

526
00:37:27,413 --> 00:37:29,999
- Nice to see you, Wesley.
- Hi, Mr. Data.

527
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:32,460
No time for courtesy.
Get the control chips back in place.

528
00:37:32,668 --> 00:37:35,504
In the correct order. Now!

529
00:37:35,713 --> 00:37:38,758
It's like a game
of how fast can you do it'?

530
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:40,760
Ah. A game.

531
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:53,564
I think I can switch this
to main viewer, sir.

532
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:11,290
Data, we've eight or nine minutes
at most. Can you finish by then?

533
00:38:11,749 --> 00:38:16,378
No. This will take slightly more time
than we have, sir.

534
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:29,600
Oh, damn it, no.
I can't afford to get this.

535
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:41,403
Beverly.

536
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:43,864
Yes, Jean-Luc?

537
00:38:45,324 --> 00:38:47,576
You will address me as captain.

538
00:38:48,953 --> 00:38:50,287
Captain?

539
00:38:50,955 --> 00:38:53,833
Well, then, my dear captain,

540
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:59,171
you will address me
as chief medical officer, or doctor.

541
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,215
- I will?
- Ha, ha.

542
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:02,591
That's true.

543
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,471
I started out by calling you Beverly,
and, of course, naturally, you--

544
00:39:09,098 --> 00:39:11,642
I'm still not thinking straight.

545
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:14,979
Likewise.
Where the hell was I headed?

546
00:39:16,939 --> 00:39:19,817
If that's something you were going
to test--

547
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:23,988
Yes, on Geordi. Come here.

548
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:39,503
See how I reversed the fields on this,
commander?

549
00:39:39,712 --> 00:39:42,506
I made it into a repulser beam.

550
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:46,176
If we just had one minute more, sir.

551
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:03,819
If this were a hundred times
more powerful than it is...

552
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:09,658
Why not try it with the real thing?

553
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:14,413
Why not reverse fields on this, ma'am,
if we just need an extra minute?

554
00:40:14,622 --> 00:40:17,625
It would take weeks
of laying out new circuits.

555
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:19,710
Why not just see it in your head?

556
00:40:20,878 --> 00:40:22,171
Yeah.

557
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:27,009
Come off the main lead,
split off at the force activator,

558
00:40:27,343 --> 00:40:29,011
then...

559
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:30,638
Then...

560
00:40:30,846 --> 00:40:34,266
If I could just think straight
about this.

561
00:40:35,059 --> 00:40:37,811
I made this a broader-based remedy.

562
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,438
I hope, ha,ha.

563
00:40:39,647 --> 00:40:43,692
But it's still very close to the formula
from the old Enterprise records.

564
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:47,029
Decades ago. Light years away.

565
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:50,407
But almost exactly the same conditions
as here.

566
00:40:50,616 --> 00:40:53,243
Wow, what was in that, doctor?

567
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:56,246
My head's beginning to clear. Ahem.

568
00:40:56,455 --> 00:40:58,290
Come here.

569
00:41:03,087 --> 00:41:07,091
Here. Take this to Engineering.
I'll make up hypos for the others.

570
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:10,719
Okay, Bev.

571
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:25,985
We're not gonna make it, captain.

572
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:28,862
If we only had a minute or so more.

573
00:41:38,205 --> 00:41:42,501
Yes, then reversing power leads,
back through the force activator,

574
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:47,047
repulser beam hard against
Tsiolkovsky.

575
00:41:51,218 --> 00:41:53,512
Don't you see?
It's giving us a push-off.

576
00:41:53,721 --> 00:41:56,015
The extra time we need.

577
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:00,185
We're pushing away.

578
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,083
Bridge, engage engines.

579
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:38,474
Captain, something seemed
to move us aside at the last minute.

580
00:42:38,682 --> 00:42:40,517
Do we owe our thanks
to Commander Data, sir?

581
00:42:40,726 --> 00:42:43,562
<i>Yes, and Wesley may have given us</i>

582
00:42:43,729 --> 00:42:45,314
<i>a few seconds too.</i>

583
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:47,900
Did he say "Wesley"? The boy?

584
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:51,111
He said "Wesley."

585
00:42:55,908 --> 00:42:59,578
It's only fair to mention Wesley
in a log entry, sir.

586
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:03,165
Fair is fair.

587
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:07,503
And let's credit
his science teacher too.

588
00:43:27,648 --> 00:43:29,441
Congratulations, sir.

589
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:31,193
To many people.

590
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:47,835
Data.

591
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:50,420
I'm only going to tell you this
just once.

592
00:43:50,629 --> 00:43:52,548
It never happened.

593
00:43:58,303 --> 00:44:00,389
I put it to you all.

594
00:44:00,764 --> 00:44:03,934
I think we shall end up
with a fine crew.

595
00:44:04,434 --> 00:44:06,603
If we avoid temptation.

596
00:44:11,275 --> 00:44:15,237
So, Number One,
let's go to our next job.

597
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:16,488
Aye, sir.

598
00:44:16,697 --> 00:44:19,324
Helm, prepare for warp 3.

599
00:44:19,533 --> 00:44:22,536
Heading 294, mark 37.

600
00:44:22,744 --> 00:44:26,874
Warp 3. Heading 294, mark 37, sir.

601
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:28,667
Engage.
