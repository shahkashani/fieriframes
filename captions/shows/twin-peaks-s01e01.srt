1
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,614
Gone fishing.

2
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:48,268
The lonesome foghorn blows.

3
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:42,531
Oh, dear.

4
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,701
Lucy?

5
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:50,831
Lucy, this is Pete Martell.
Lucy, put Harry on the horn.

6
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,041
Sheriff,
it's Pete Martell up at the mill.

7
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:57,713
Um, I'm gonna transfer it to the phone
on the table by the red chair.

8
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,382
The red chair against the wall.

9
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,510
The little table with the lamp on it.

10
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,887
The lamp that we moved
from the corner.

11
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:10,350
The black phone,
not the brown phone.

12
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,564
Morning, Pete. Harry.

13
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,775
She's dead.

14
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,902
Wrapped in plastic.

15
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,323
Whoa, hold on.
Hold on a second, Pete.

16
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,034
Where?

17
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,912
You stay right there. I'm on my way.

18
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,878
You better get Dr. Hayward.

19
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,713
Tell him to meet me up
at the Packard Mill,

20
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,131
the dock right below the dam.

21
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,634
And roust that Andy out of bed,
tell him to get his butt up there now.

22
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:47,846
- What is it?
- We got a body up there.

23
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:53,310
Lucy, not a word about this to anyone
until you hear from me.

24
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,625
It's over here.

25
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,929
You want forensics first?

26
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,473
No, she's been in the water.

27
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,476
We'd better take some pictures.

28
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:40,440
- Who is she?
- Andy, pictures.

29
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,192
- Sorry.
- Then we'll turn her over.

30
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,903
Sure, okay.

31
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,172
Oh, Andy.

32
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,508
My God, Andy.

33
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,052
Same thing as last year
in Mr. Blodgett's barn.

34
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,639
- Give me the camera, Andy.
- Sorry.

35
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,683
Is this gonna happen
every damn time?

36
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,394
I'm sorry.

37
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,062
- I'm so sorry.
- Okay. Okay.

38
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,148
Why don't you go up
to the coroner's van

39
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,275
and bring back that stretcher?

40
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,776
- Okay.
- Okay.

41
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,154
Sorry.

42
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:33,034
Harry, let's roll her over.

43
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:56,600
Good Lord. Laura.

44
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,438
Laura Palmer.

45
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,400
Laura.

46
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:12,073
Laura, sweetheart,
I'm not gonna tell you again.

47
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,579
Yes, I am.

48
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,081
Laura.

49
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,384
Laura?

50
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,262
Oh, for goodness sakes.

51
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:43,271
Laura, now means now.

52
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,066
Laura?

53
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,612
Laura?

54
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:57,911
Laura, honey, are you downstairs?

55
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,654
- Hello?
- Bett, it's Sarah.

56
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,574
Listen, I just went up to wake Laura
and she's not here.

57
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,159
- Is she with Bobby?
- Well, she could be.

58
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,496
He leaves every morning to go running
and then he goes to football practice.

59
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:46,042
Can you, um, find out?
Can you reach him? I'll call the school.

60
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,837
Just a minute, I've got
the number of the field office here.

61
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,715
Thanks. Thanks, Bett.

62
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,719
You know, I'm wondering
if maybe she went out with Leland.

63
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,012
He had an early meeting.

64
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,349
Oh, I'm sure that's it.
Either that or she's with Bobby.

65
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:05,854
Sure. I'll call up to the hotel, thanks.

66
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,443
Hmm.

67
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:16,698
No, Bobby hasn't showed up
for practice yet today.

68
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,950
And come to think of it,
as a matter of fact,

69
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,494
he's been late every day this week,
Mrs. Palmer.

70
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:22,704
And last week.

71
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,874
And maybe even the week before.

72
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,374
- Are they ready to sign?
- You're not gonna mention

73
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,043
that we have not as yet acquired
access to the Packard land?

74
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,091
Sorry.

75
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:22,263
We have solid information

76
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:26,518
that the Packard Sawmill
is gonna go belly-up within a year.

77
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:32,315
We're gonna be able to get it
for a song. One verse, no chorus.

78
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,984
Now,

79
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,695
let's get out there

80
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:41,199
and get those cheese-eaters
where they live.

81
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,035
Ahh, Benjamin...

82
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,708
Clean, wholesome environment,
much like your very own.

83
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,421
With a quality of life

84
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:59,008
to rival the very best
that this country has to offer.

85
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:06,182
And that is what the Ghostwood
Country Club and Estates will be.

86
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,895
Now, when I first spoke to Sven,

87
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:17,902
he was naturally very concerned
about the quality of air here.

88
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,321
If you'll permit me, Sven,

89
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:24,033
to repeat what you told me
this morning after your run:

90
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:29,664
"My air sacs, ah,
have never felt so good."

91
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:38,548
Your wife's on the phone again.
She said it's urgent.

92
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:45,430
Excuse me a moment, gentlemen.
I'll be right back.

93
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,933
Uh, make it snappy, huh?

94
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,352
So...

95
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,147
...here in Twin Peaks,

96
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:59,360
health and industry
go hand in hand.

97
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:04,532
- I'll transfer you to the house phone.
- Okay, thank you.

98
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,540
Ahh. Sarah, what is it?

99
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,667
- Is Laura with you?
- No, why?

100
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,503
She didn't go with you this morning?

101
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,756
No, what...? Honey, what's wrong?
What's this all about?

102
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,716
She's not here.
She wasn't here this morning.

103
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:25,303
Well, she's, um,
probably with Bobby.

104
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,013
I can't find Bobby.

105
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,307
Well, there you are. That's it.

106
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,977
Let's not worry.
I mean, they're probably together.

107
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,979
She would've left a note.
Why didn't she?

108
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,233
- She would've told me.
- Honey, honey, take it easy, please.

109
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,069
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Leland Palmer.

110
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,072
He's right over there on the phone.

111
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:45,990
Sheriff Truman.

112
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,662
What? Who? What did you say?

113
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,918
Oh, my God.

114
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,256
Oh, God. Laura.

115
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,590
No.

116
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:06,886
Laura. Oh, Leland, please, what is it?
Tell me.

117
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,264
Leland...

118
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,850
Is this about Laura?

119
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,309
I'm afraid it is.

120
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,272
Leland?

121
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,691
Tell me.

122
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,443
Oh. My baby.

123
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,616
No! Oh, no!

124
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:32,287
- No.
- Okay?

125
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,039
Leland, we're ready to go
with the contracts.

126
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,254
Leland?

127
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,965
What's wrong?

128
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,385
My daughter's dead.

129
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,419
No!

130
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,490
What kept you, Heidi?
Seconds on knockwurst this morning?

131
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,076
I couldn't get my car started.

132
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,078
Too busy jump-starting
the old man, huh?

133
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,082
I thought you Germans
were always on time.

134
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:09,092
I thought the only time you cared
about, Bobby, was making time.

135
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,844
You heading out, Shelly?

136
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,721
Yeah, I'm heading home.

137
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:17,058
I'm going to practice. I can drop you
by your place on the way if you want.

138
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,188
That would be great, thanks.

139
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:31,531
Here's a tune for you, gals.

140
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,450
Okay.

141
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,995
Norma.

142
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,956
I'll see you in my dreams.

143
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,084
Not if I see you first.

144
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:47,005
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

145
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,021
I think she knows about us.

146
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,189
- Norma?
- Mm-hm.

147
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:10,445
No. Fat chance.
I think she's hot to trot for you herself.

148
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,101
It's happy hour in France.

149
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,687
Come on, cowboy, light your fire.

150
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:49,192
Right. Just a little pick-me-up
before home room?

151
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:57,033
- I thought I was your little pick-me-up.
- Ha, ha.

152
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:02,455
Baby, you are more like
a three-stage rocket.

153
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,708
A pocket rocket.

154
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,920
And what stage are we in now?

155
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:14,175
Are you sure that your old man
is still on the road?

156
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,719
Yes, he called me last night
from Butte.

157
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:20,389
That's a long ways away
and he ain't got a phone in his truck.

158
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:25,144
So quit worrying
and start scurrying, Mr. Touchdown.

159
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,150
Butte.

160
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,944
Back up.

161
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,785
I'll call you later.

162
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,763
Leland, I'm so sorry.

163
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,516
Seventeen years old.

164
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,315
Lee, I hate to put you through this.

165
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,694
No, I have to see her.

166
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:18,156
I have to see
what was done to my little girl.

167
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,201
Okay.

168
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,854
My baby.

169
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,981
It's my little girl.

170
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:56,527
- God, God.
- Let's get out of here.

171
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,737
I can't...

172
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,909
Oh, God.

173
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,373
- Have you seen Laura?
- No, not yet.

174
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,961
- Nice day for a picnic.
- Uh, yeah.

175
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,603
Bobby Briggs,
they're looking for you.

176
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,689
- Who is?
- Sheriff is.

177
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,817
Well, here I am in school.

178
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:27,576
- Hey, Snake.
- Hey, man, something's up.

179
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:30,288
- Where?
- Think I'm kidding?

180
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,914
What, me worry?

181
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:35,167
Bobby, you're wanted in the office.

182
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:39,839
- Who wants me in the office?
- Right now, young man.

183
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,800
Watch out.

184
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,984
- Terry Franklin?
- Here.

185
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,652
- Martha Grimes?
- Here.

186
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,030
- Donna Hayward?
- Here.

187
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,949
- Audrey Horne?
- Here.

188
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,951
- James Hurley?
- Yo.

189
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,205
Excuse me. Room 106?

190
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,832
Mm-hm.

191
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,710
Is there a Bobby Briggs
in this classroom?

192
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:21,255
No, um, he's in 107? 107.

193
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,299
Could I speak to you
for a moment, please?

194
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,134
Certainly.

195
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,178
- Um, there's a...
- Mm-hm.

196
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,602
The principal will be making
an announcement.

197
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,687
Yes?

198
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,607
Thank you for your time.

199
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,126
Laura.

200
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,387
There will be an announcement
from the principal.

201
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:29,532
I told you, I got up early
like I always do.

202
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:31,951
I went running like I always do.

203
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,786
I went for some breakfast
at the Double R

204
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:37,206
and I didn't go to practice
because I didn't feel like it.

205
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,543
Why didn't you feel like it, Bobby?
Were you upset about something?

206
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,838
Something troubling you,
Bobby? You wanna tell us about it?

207
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:48,134
Look, you guys, please, what did I do?
What's going on?

208
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,761
Mr. Wolchezk,
there's rumors all over school.

209
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,722
Maybe it's best
if they heard it from you.

210
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:57,309
Mr. Wolchezk, why don't you go ahead
and make that announcement?

211
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:00,688
- Now?
- Now's the time.

212
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,566
Excuse me.

213
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:07,403
What is it, sheriff? What's going on?

214
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:12,950
Now, Bobby, you look at me.

215
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:16,829
Your girlfriend,
Laura Palmer's, been killed.

216
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:20,082
She was found just after dawn.

217
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,585
Now, she was with you last night

218
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:27,089
and you weren't where you
were supposed to be this morning.

219
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:30,426
Have these fellas advised you
of your rights?

220
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:35,181
Yes, but I didn't know why.

221
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,100
- Laura's dead?
- Yes.

222
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:42,771
Did you understand your rights
as they were explained to you?

223
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,817
You think I killed her?

224
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,486
We're gonna have you
make a phone call.

225
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,697
You can call your parents and they can
arrange to get a lawyer to be with you

226
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:54,783
when we talk to you again.

227
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:59,121
Andy, take Bobby out
to make his call.

228
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:07,171
I loved her.

229
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:11,175
And she loved me.

230
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:14,345
You think because I wasn't at football
practice that I killed my girlfriend?

231
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,096
You are crazy.

232
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:18,641
You get off of me.

233
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:23,354
Bobby, we're gonna talk
about this later.

234
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:29,485
May I have your attention, please?
This is Principal Wolchezk.

235
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:34,740
I am deeply saddened
to have to tell you

236
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:40,371
that early this morning your classmate
Laura Palmer was found dead.

237
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:45,626
This is a terrible moment
for all of us.

238
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,380
For all of us who knew her.

239
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:54,260
Her friends, her family.

240
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:59,932
It is very important that we all try
to help each other

241
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,351
through this difficult time.

242
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:11,610
The police have asked me
to ask each of you,

243
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:16,198
if you have any information
about Laura's activities

244
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:19,451
after school yesterday

245
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:22,204
or yesterday evening,

246
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,999
please come forward.

247
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:31,005
I am dismissing all classes
for the day,

248
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:33,841
but before we leave,

249
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:37,094
I would like to ask each of you

250
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:41,849
to join me in a moment of silence

251
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,560
for Laura

252
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:48,147
and her dear memory.

253
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:52,776
Oh, God.

254
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,350
You can talk to her now, Harry.

255
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,145
Do you know what time it was

256
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:13,691
when you last saw Laura,
Mrs. Palmer?

257
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,695
- What time?
- Yes.

258
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,282
Uh, it would have been about 9.

259
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:27,496
Yes, 9:00...

260
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,166
...p.m.

261
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,795
She came home from Bobby's

262
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:40,551
and she was going up the stairs.

263
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:45,723
Those stairs right there.

264
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,188
Who's upstairs?

265
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:56,191
Your husband and one of my men.

266
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:06,869
I can tell from the sounds
that it isn't her.

267
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,429
Her diary?

268
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,852
Do you know where the key
to this is, sir?

269
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:38,984
- Do you have to take that?
- We'll return it as soon as possible.

270
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,295
Did she say anything to you?

271
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,009
No.

272
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:08,430
She said good night.

273
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:14,311
And I said good...

274
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:22,611
Good night, sweetheart.

275
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:37,459
Mrs. Palmer, can you remember,

276
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:41,880
did she make or receive
any phone calls?

277
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:49,346
I heard her phone ring once.

278
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,390
About what time was that?

279
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:55,644
I don't know who it was.

280
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,860
Harry.

281
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:07,781
That was Lucy.

282
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:11,618
Got a call from a guy that works up
at the mill, Janek Pulaski.

283
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:14,705
Says his daughter didn't come home
last night.

284
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:18,625
And she didn't show up
at school today either.

285
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:43,442
Two by fours, four by eights.

286
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,904
Two by fours, four by...

287
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,740
Did you hear me?
You can't do that to my workers.

288
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:53,076
Don't walk away from me like that.
Come on back here.

289
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,328
You're not going anywhere

290
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:57,831
and you're not gonna tell
anybody anything.

291
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,417
Katherine,

292
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:04,004
I'm sorry if this offends you,
but I am the owner of this sawmill.

293
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,381
And you don't know the first thing
about this mill.

294
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,717
That's why I'm running it.

295
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:12,804
I've never taken this authority before,
but maybe I should have.

296
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,598
You're not shutting us down.

297
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:18,810
Katherine, I have the final say-so.

298
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:22,356
Peter, push the plug.

299
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,149
Pete, don't you dare.

300
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:31,823
Katherine, please.

301
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:39,957
Shorty, tell the boys to pull the plug.

302
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,376
That's right.

303
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,515
May I have your attention?
This is Josie Packard.

304
00:32:57,183 --> 00:33:00,894
I've decided that today,
in the light of what has happened,

305
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,646
all work here will stop.

306
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:03,855
Bitch.

307
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:09,152
This morning, as you know,
the body of Miss Laura Palmer...

308
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,362
What's your name?

309
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,489
- Was found near our dock.
- Fred Truax.

310
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,783
You're fired.

311
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:20,622
Just now your coworker and a friend,
Mr. Janek Pulaski,

312
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:24,501
has learned that his daughter,

313
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:29,172
one of Laura's schoolmates,
is missing since last night.

314
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,301
Today, all work here will stop.

315
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,303
The mill will shut down.

316
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:42,477
Perhaps you can
spend the day with your families.

317
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:45,313
Thank you all for your attention.

318
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,304
What the hell?

319
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,219
Laura's dead.

320
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,515
Yeah, I heard.

321
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,104
She was the one.

322
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:11,608
Buy you a coffee?

323
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,278
Can't do it.

324
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:22,119
If you see Donna,
could you give this to her?

325
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,204
You bet.

326
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:29,626
Ed.

327
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:33,547
Ed.

328
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:38,009
They said those drapes
would be ready by 10.

329
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:41,972
Now, I want those drapes up
by nightfall.

330
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:10,417
Diane, 11:30 a.m., February 24th.
Entering the town of Twin Peaks.

331
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,335
It's five miles south
of the Canadian border,

332
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:15,338
twelve miles west of the state line.

333
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:19,176
I've never seen so many trees
in my life.

334
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:23,096
As W.C. Fields would say,
"I'd rather be here than Philadelphia."

335
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:26,016
Fifty-four degrees
on a slightly overcast day.

336
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,101
Weatherman said rain.

337
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:31,479
If you could get paid that kind of money
for being wrong 60 percent of the time,

338
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:33,899
it'd beat working.

339
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:37,402
Mileage is 79,345,
gauge is on reserve.

340
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,447
I'm riding on fumes here,
I gotta tank up when I get into town.

341
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,283
Remind me to tell you
how much that is.

342
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:48,413
Lunch was, uh, $6.31
at the Lamplighter Inn.

343
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:51,708
That's on Highway 2
near Lewis Fork.

344
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,044
That was a tuna fish sandwich
on whole wheat,

345
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,171
slice of cherry pie
and a cup of coffee.

346
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,881
Damn good food.

347
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,384
Diane, if you ever get up this way,
that cherry pie is worth a stop.

348
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,511
Okay.

349
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:07,140
Looks like I'll be
meeting up with a, uh...

350
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,601
...Sheriff Harry S. Truman.

351
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,269
Shouldn't be too hard
to remember that.

352
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,563
He'll be
at the Calhoun Memorial Hospital.

353
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,732
Guess we're gonna go
and take a look at that girl

354
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,401
that crawled down the railroad tracks
off the mountain.

355
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,111
When finished,
I'll check into a motel.

356
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:23,365
The sheriff will be able to recommend
a clean place and reasonably priced.

357
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:26,826
That's what I need.
A clean place, reasonably priced.

358
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:30,330
Oh. Diane, I almost forgot.

359
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,582
I've got to find out
what kind of trees these are.

360
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,043
They're really something.

361
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,129
- Agent Cooper?
- Yes.

362
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:40,799
- Sheriff Harry S. Truman.
- Dale Cooper, FBI.

363
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,468
- Pleasure. Ahem.
- Good to meet you.

364
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:47,472
- Have any trouble finding the place?
- No, no. Your directions were fine.

365
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,059
Came out over Highway 2,
near Lewis Fork.

366
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,103
Stopped at a place
called the Lamplighter Inn.

367
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,606
Had a slice of cherry pie. Incredible.

368
00:37:56,774 --> 00:38:00,318
Well, I'll tell you,
we're sure glad to have the FBI here.

369
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:04,281
Kind of lucky, in a way, that Ronette
stepped out across the state line.

370
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,991
Whole town's
really badly shaken up.

371
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:08,034
Sure, nice, quiet place,
something like this.

372
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,954
Sheriff, let me stop you
in the hallway here for just a second.

373
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,498
There's a few things
we gotta get straight right off the bat.

374
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,584
I've learned about this the hard way.
It's best to talk about it up front.

375
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:19,963
When the Bureau gets called in,
the Bureau's in charge.

376
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,631
Now, you're gonna be
working for me.

377
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,591
Sometimes local law
has a problem with that.

378
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,135
I hope you understand.

379
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,930
Well, like I said,
we're glad to have you here.

380
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,765
Sheriff,

381
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:34,769
what kind of fantastic trees
have you got growing around here?

382
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:38,315
- Big, majestic...
- Douglas firs.

383
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:41,401
Douglas firs.

384
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:46,740
Can someone get me a copy of
the coroner's report on the dead girl?

385
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:49,117
Well, the autopsy
hasn't been done yet.

386
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,161
But I'll take you downstairs
to the morgue

387
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,579
when we're finished here.

388
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,664
Oh, that will be fine.

389
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:03,214
Dr. Shelvy,
this is FBI Agent Cooper.

390
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:05,383
- Glad to know you.
- Doctor, how's the girl?

391
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:08,053
She's in shock,
suffering from exposure.

392
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:12,182
- Can I see her?
- All right, this way.

393
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,491
Was she raped?

394
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:30,700
Several times.

395
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:34,162
- One perpetrator?
- We're waiting for the results.

396
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,374
Is there any connection
to the dead girl?

397
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,292
Same high school.

398
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,295
Far as we know,
they hardly knew each other.

399
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,131
- No connection.
- Mm.

400
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:47,842
I'd like to question her.

401
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:52,764
This girl doesn't even
know where she is. Or if she is.

402
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,724
What exactly are you saying?

403
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:59,020
We need a CAT scan
and we're not equipped for that here.

404
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:02,565
My opinion,
she may have neurological damage.

405
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,151
She's just not responsive at all.

406
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:11,157
I'd like to examine her fingers.

407
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:17,414
All right.

408
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:28,716
- They've already scraped for particles.
- No, that's not what I'm looking for.

409
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:34,472
Oh, no, there's nothing here.
Not a thing.

410
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:42,021
Don't go there.

411
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,440
Ronnie?

412
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,900
Ronette?

413
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:05,336
I catch this fish,
pull him out of the water, big mouth.

414
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:08,798
It's got a big mouth
and starts talking to me. Wh...?

415
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,049
Hey, hey.

416
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,641
Harry?

417
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,810
Dr. Jacoby.

418
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,481
Terrible, terrible tragedy.

419
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,733
Yes.

420
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,115
This is Special Agent Dale Cooper.

421
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,826
- Gary Cooper?
- Agent Cooper.

422
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,287
Agent. FBI.

423
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,206
- Right.
- Heh.

424
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:43,583
Dr. Lawrence Jacoby, Agent Cooper.

425
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:47,587
Laura was a patient of mine.

426
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,256
You're on your way to the morgue
now, do you mind if I join you?

427
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:53,176
Yes, I do. Why would you want to?

428
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,470
It's sort of against procedure, doctor.

429
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:59,641
Heh. Well, no offense.
I thought I could be of some help.

430
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:02,519
You still could be. At another time.

431
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,812
Oh. I understand completely.

432
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,564
By the way,

433
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,275
Laura's...

434
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,819
Laura's parents...

435
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:16,115
Well, they didn't know
that she was seeing me. Ha, ha.

436
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:29,212
- That guy's a psychiatrist?
- Yeah.

437
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:37,011
I have to apologize again
for the fluorescent lights.

438
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:39,514
I think it's a bad transformer.

439
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:42,016
That's quite all right.

440
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:47,772
Agent Cooper, we did scrape
those nails when we brought her in.

441
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,943
Here it is.

442
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,612
- There it is. Oh, my God, here it is.
- What?

443
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,198
- Would you leave us, please?
- Jim.

444
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,783
Uh, would you
leave us alone, please?

445
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:01,452
Oh! Certainly.

446
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:05,456
I've got to find something
to grab onto this with.

447
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,610
Diane, I'm at the Twin Peaks County
Morgue with the body of the victim...

448
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,111
- What's her name?
- Laura Palmer.

449
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,321
Laura Palmer.

450
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:38,781
I got here before the autopsy.
Diane, it's the same thing.

451
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,533
I had a feeling we'd see this again.

452
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,785
What do you got there?

453
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:46,539
Ring finger, under the nail.

454
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:50,752
Let's see what he left us.

455
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,380
It's an "R."

456
00:43:56,675 --> 00:44:00,345
Diane, give this to Albert and his team.
Don't go to Sam.

457
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:02,055
Albert seems
a little more on the ball.

458
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:06,017
- We need to bag and tag this.
- Okay, Cooper.

459
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:08,728
You gonna let me in
on whatever the hell is going on here?

460
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:12,857
Sheriff, we got a lot to talk about.

461
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:42,053
Hi, Ed.

462
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,389
Hey, Donna.

463
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:54,899
I'm so sorry.

464
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:00,363
- Have you seen James yet?
- He came by.

465
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:03,074
- Is he okay?
- No.

466
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,952
Do you know where he went?
I've already been to the Roadhouse.

467
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:09,914
I don't know, honey.
He told me to give you this.

468
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,509
What the hell are you doing?

469
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:24,053
- Well, I came by...
- I've been looking all over for you.

470
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,681
In case you didn't realize it,
Bobby's in a lot of trouble.

471
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,850
He's my best friend.
You're supposed to be with me.

472
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:30,518
We're going to the police station.

473
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,520
Look, don't tell me
where I ought to be.

474
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:36,107
Second of all,
Laura was my best friend.

475
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,609
- Get in the car.
- Muffle it, junior.

476
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:41,696
- Mind your own business.
- You're on my lot, friend.

477
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,741
Oh, Ed, I'm not your friend.

478
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:49,162
Donna, you get to the sheriff's
right now.

479
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,921
Boy, I sure know
how to pick them, huh?

480
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:02,550
Ed, you waiting for those drapes
to hang themselves?

481
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,135
Yeah, okay.

482
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,640
Well, I know how to pick them too.

483
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,478
Will you do me a favor?

484
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:15,730
If James comes around,
tell him I'm looking for him?

485
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,107
You bet.

486
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,860
And, Donna, you take it easy.

487
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,321
Okay.

488
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:36,626
That's the, uh, videotape we just saw.
The one we found in Laura's bedroom.

489
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,211
Right.

490
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:41,672
At a certain point, I'm gonna wanna
show this to the boyfriend.

491
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,133
You say when.

492
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:47,970
- Did you complete your forensics?
- You bet. All done.

493
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:51,933
- No key yet, huh?
- We're still looking.

494
00:46:58,106 --> 00:46:59,148
Why not?

495
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:08,699
Diane, I've just opened
Laura Palmer's diary.

496
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:10,451
This is the, uh...

497
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:14,205
It's the last entry,
dated February 23rd.

498
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:20,878
It reads, "Asparagus for dinner again.
I hate asparagus.

499
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,381
Does this mean I'll never grow up?"

500
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:27,468
And then she's written,
"Nervous about meeting J tonight."

501
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:30,596
That's the letter J, Diane.

502
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:33,349
J...

503
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:38,187
And that is the last entry.

504
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,730
That's something to get started on.

505
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:42,400
Yeah, that's one out of 26.

506
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,151
Yeah, one out of 26.

507
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:49,198
Diane, I've just turned back 18 days
to day one.

508
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:52,535
What we have taped to the page here
is a plastic envelope

509
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,912
containing a white residue
and what looks to be a key

510
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,789
to a safety deposit box.

511
00:47:57,457 --> 00:48:02,295
Sheriff, after you very carefully
remove this key,

512
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:04,964
we're gonna run this envelope.

513
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:09,927
And my bet is
it'll test positive for cocaine.

514
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,263
That's impossible.

515
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:14,974
You ever been surprised before?

516
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:20,104
Mr. Cooper,
you didn't know Laura Palmer.

517
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:23,482
Let's get started on a court order
to open that safety deposit box,

518
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:26,110
and maybe we'll both find out
a few things about Laura Palmer.

519
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:38,164
Diane, I'm holding in my hand
a small box of chocolate bunnies.

520
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:47,673
Lucy.

521
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:49,884
Andy, is that you?

522
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:54,472
Tell Harry we found
where... it happened.

523
00:48:55,641 --> 00:49:00,311
Where Ronette
and Laura were taken and tortured.

524
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,647
Tell Harry...

525
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:08,486
...I didn't cry.

526
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:12,740
Andy, are you okay?

527
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:14,367
Sweetie?

528
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:17,536
But, Lucy,

529
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:22,667
it's horrible.

530
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:25,836
Andy.

531
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:27,546
Sweetie.

532
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:31,634
Oh, God.

533
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,896
This is to reaffirm
that you have been advised

534
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:46,816
of your constitutional rights,
am I correct?

535
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,234
Yes.

536
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:51,570
Bobby, did you kill Laura Palmer?

537
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,030
No.

538
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:56,617
She was studying at your house
until about 9:30 last night,

539
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,202
isn't that right?

540
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:59,537
Yeah.

541
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:01,580
Bobby.

542
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:03,541
Yes, sir.

543
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:05,960
Did she drive herself home?

544
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,129
Yes.

545
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,799
You two had a big fight last week,
didn't you?

546
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,843
So what?

547
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,429
If I had a fight with her,
if I sang songs with her,

548
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:19,557
if I went skipping rope with her,
what difference does it make?

549
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,642
I didn't kill her.

550
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:30,109
Bobby, here's how this works.

551
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:34,488
We ask the questions, and you answer
the questions that we ask.

552
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:36,449
Briefly and to the point.

553
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,512
Did you shoot this video, Bobby?

554
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:02,475
No.

555
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:07,021
Well, if you didn't, then who did?

556
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:10,274
Did you know Laura
was seeing someone else?

557
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:12,943
That's what you two fought about
last week.

558
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:17,698
Look at these pictures.

559
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:21,619
Look how happy she is.

560
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,625
You ever do cocaine with Laura,
Bobby?

561
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:31,170
I don't do drugs.

562
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:34,715
Excuse me, but what are you charging
my client with?

563
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,514
That's right.

564
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:46,143
You're a football player,
aren't you, Bobby?

565
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:52,441
Bobby, if you knew
who she was seeing,

566
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:55,528
trust us on this,
now's the time to tell us.

567
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:56,737
Why don't you ask Donna?

568
00:51:56,905 --> 00:52:00,324
- She was there with her.
- Because I'm asking you.

569
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,160
Come on, Bobby. Give me a name.

570
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:08,082
Here's a hint. First initial, J.

571
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:13,170
J.

572
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:25,266
No.

573
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:29,687
She wouldn't do that to me.

574
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,566
You didn't love her, anyway.

575
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:37,111
Let him go.

576
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:55,337
Julie, the Norwegians are signing
the contract at 4:00

577
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,089
when Mr. Horne returns.

578
00:52:57,257 --> 00:53:01,260
Make sure they do not hear
about Laura Palmer's death.

579
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:04,179
That will blow the whole deal, got it?

580
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:06,015
- Okay, Bob.
- Thank you, okay.

581
00:53:06,182 --> 00:53:11,604
Okay, Bob. Okay, Bob. Okay.

582
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:18,903
Julie, what would happen
if I pulled this out?

583
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:21,196
You wouldn't.

584
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:25,743
- Oh... Oh. Oh!
- Ha, ha.

585
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:28,871
Audrey, look what you've done.

586
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,581
Audrey... Oh...

587
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:32,416
Did they scarf
that whole damn smorgasbord?

588
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,752
- Audrey, honey, don't you go in there.
- I'm hungry.

589
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,462
Audrey, don't...

590
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,881
Don't go in there. Audrey.

591
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:28,472
Excuse me, is there something wrong,
young, pretty girl?

592
00:54:30,266 --> 00:54:33,435
They found my friend Laura

593
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:38,315
lying face down on a rocky beach.

594
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:41,610
Completely naked.

595
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:45,364
She'd been murdered.

596
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,471
Hey, buddy.

597
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,140
Snake.

598
00:55:11,307 --> 00:55:12,349
We're out of here, man.

599
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:15,561
Just a sec. Donna's still in there.

600
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:20,024
- You straightened her out yet?
- I don't know what's up with her, man.

601
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:26,363
Forget her.
I got it figured, Laura and her.

602
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:30,534
That cop mentioned something
about the letter J.

603
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:32,828
We're looking
at some freaking biker.

604
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:37,166
And some freaking biker's
gonna get his head busted open.

605
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:39,793
What's his name?
And we'll finish this quick.

606
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:51,805
Come outside.

607
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:58,937
Robert, I'll be at home this evening,
if you need a sympathetic ear.

608
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:02,316
I don't need
any damn sympathetic anything.

609
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:08,072
You know, dear,
I have no idea what's going on here.

610
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:10,532
- I...
- Let's just go home.

611
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:17,247
So you were on a picnic, just the two
of you, way up in the mountains.

612
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:19,875
Not another soul around?

613
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:23,712
Is there some law
against having a picnic?

614
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:27,132
Donna, this is interesting to me.

615
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,553
Because with just the two of you
out there, I can't for the life of me

616
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:34,306
figure out
how these pictures got taken.

617
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,308
Uh...

618
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:39,561
Well, that's easy. There was

619
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:42,898
this, um, hiker that came along.

620
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:47,152
This woman hiker
had a backpack and...

621
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:49,196
Um...

622
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:52,074
We asked her
to take the pictures for us.

623
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:55,077
What was her name?

624
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:57,746
I don't know.
I don't think we asked her.

625
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:58,956
I forgot. I don't know.

626
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,589
Donna, who are you protecting?

627
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:11,093
Nobody.
That's really what happened.

628
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:14,429
Does this person's name
start with the letter J?

629
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:17,349
No, she didn't tell us her name.

630
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:19,810
Donna, this is serious business.

631
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:23,397
More serious
than Laura falling in love

632
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,149
with someone
other than her boyfriend.

633
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:27,192
Much more serious than you know.

634
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,694
Agent Cooper,

635
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:31,155
the sheriff's ready to roll up
to the site.

636
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:33,949
And I've got something else
for you here.

637
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:36,618
You can come on in.

638
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:41,373
I know Laura was your best friend.

639
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:46,795
You've been through a lot today.

640
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:49,131
We're finished here
for the time being.

641
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:51,425
Okay.

642
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:10,444
Go ahead, Lucy,
tell Agent Cooper what you heard.

643
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:11,904
Okay.

644
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:15,574
Now, after you were done with Bobby
and he was taken back to his cell,

645
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:19,578
well, then his parents were standing
by the door with his lawyer,

646
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:21,371
and Bobby, he was released,

647
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:23,373
and he came out
and he saw his friend Mike,

648
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:24,875
who was down by the water cooler,

649
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:26,752
- which is near my desk.
- Mm-hm, mm-hm.

650
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:30,714
Okay, okay.
Well, I pretended to be typing,

651
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:32,883
but I was typing
what Mike and Bobby were saying.

652
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:37,554
And, well, they didn't say exactly
who it was they were talking about,

653
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:40,515
but anyway,
here's what they were saying.

654
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:43,602
They said the person we're looking for
is a biker.

655
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:47,439
Yeah.

656
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:54,446
Looks like a hog to me.

657
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:56,990
Holy smoke.

658
00:58:57,158 --> 00:59:00,494
Holy smoke.

659
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:38,365
The Norwegians are leaving.
The Norwegians are leaving.

660
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:40,325
The Norwegians are gone.

661
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:42,911
- Everybody gone? Not good.
- The Norwegians are leaving.

662
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:44,663
- Norwegians are leaving.
- Listen to me.

663
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:47,582
You are throwing away the investment
opportunity of a lifetime.

664
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,543
Better that
than to throw a lifetime away.

665
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:51,586
You stay out of this!

666
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:55,090
- Ha, ha.
- The Norwegians are leaving.

667
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,722
Sheriff.

668
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:48,226
Diane, it's 4:10 in the afternoon
at the scene of the crime.

669
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:50,562
Here's something
we haven't seen before.

670
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:53,148
A mound of dirt approximately
a foot and a half in diameter.

671
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:55,984
On the top is a gold necklace
with a gold heart.

672
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:58,987
Correction, half a gold heart.

673
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:02,699
At the base of the mound of dirt
is a torn piece of newsprint

674
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:05,952
written with the words,
which appear to be in blood:

675
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:09,664
"Fire walk with me."

676
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:17,172
Sheriff, you and I have gotta find out
who's got the other half of that heart.

677
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:12,853
Mrs. Horne.

678
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:17,732
Mrs. Horne, it might help
if you talk to Johnny yourself.

679
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,568
So you think it might help?

680
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:23,613
Well, you can tell Johnny
one more time

681
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:27,909
that Laura isn't coming this afternoon
to work with him.

682
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:31,121
Or tomorrow afternoon
or any afternoon.

683
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:35,000
Now, what is so difficult
to understand about that?

684
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:45,677
Thank you.

685
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:52,517
Oh, it fell down.

686
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:57,147
I knew Laura.
She was always so nice.

687
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:59,316
When was the last time
she came in?

688
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:03,778
Oh, I couldn't tell you exactly.
Uh, we have so many boxes.

689
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:05,363
You don't keep records?

690
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:07,115
Well, we have plenty of paperwork.

691
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,451
Can you tell me how long
she's had this box?

692
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:12,329
I'd say about six months.

693
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:13,830
Um, I could check for you.

694
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:15,081
Would you, please?

695
01:03:15,249 --> 01:03:17,125
And close the door on the way out.

696
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:19,336
- Okay.
- Thank you.

697
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:32,182
"Flesh World."

698
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,851
Man, oh, man.

699
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:45,987
There's over $10,000 here.

700
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:49,282
That's a lot of Girl Scout cookies.

701
01:03:54,705 --> 01:03:57,332
Here's a page that's marked.

702
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,630
There's your connection.

703
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:05,006
Ronette Pulaski.

704
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:08,051
I can't believe it.

705
01:04:16,727 --> 01:04:20,272
Local
and federal law-enforcement officials

706
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:23,608
emerging from this abandoned
railway car, which is believed to be...

707
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:26,236
Shelly, would you please
turn the television set off?

708
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:28,446
Why, Leo? I wanna see this.

709
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:30,448
Ronette Pulaski, a second...

710
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:31,658
Shelly, turn it off.

711
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:34,494
Apparently escaped
her captor and fled to safety,

712
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:38,790
remains hospitalized
and in critical condition at Cal...

713
01:04:40,084 --> 01:04:42,252
Shelly, sit down here a minute
and help me out.

714
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,220
What kind of cigarettes
do you smoke?

715
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:54,347
Whatever's around.

716
01:04:54,515 --> 01:04:55,932
No, you don't.

717
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:59,603
You smoke these.
What are these doing here?

718
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:01,980
Come on, Leo,
I pick up different packs

719
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:04,232
from the diner all the time,
me and Norma.

720
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,692
There's two things, Shelly.

721
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,611
When I come home,
this house should be clean.

722
01:05:07,778 --> 01:05:09,446
- And I mean clean.
- Okay.

723
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:12,198
Number two, you smoke one brand
of cigarettes from now on,

724
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:14,534
because if I ever see
two different brands of cigarettes

725
01:05:14,702 --> 01:05:17,329
in this house again,
I'm gonna snap your neck like a twig.

726
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:20,999
Okay, Leo, you have nothing
to worry about with me, darling.

727
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:22,959
That's right.

728
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:37,974
Big Ed's Gas Farm.
This is Ed speaking.

729
01:05:38,142 --> 01:05:41,436
I'm sorry, I know I promised
not to call you there,

730
01:05:41,937 --> 01:05:44,064
but I have to see you.

731
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:46,733
I feel so bad.

732
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:48,818
It's okay.

733
01:05:50,821 --> 01:05:54,616
Why don't I, uh, meet you
at the Roadhouse around 9:30?

734
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:56,743
Thank you, Ed.

735
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:58,662
I'll see you tonight.

736
01:05:58,829 --> 01:06:00,955
All right, sweetheart.

737
01:06:20,017 --> 01:06:21,851
I think I saw a cottontail rabbit.

738
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:23,853
It must have been
a snowshoe rabbit.

739
01:06:24,021 --> 01:06:25,355
- Snowshoe?
- Right.

740
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:29,234
Snowshoe. Snowshoe rabbit.

741
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:35,198
Who's the babe?

742
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:37,992
That's one of the most
beautiful women in the state.

743
01:06:38,452 --> 01:06:40,120
Mrs. Packard.

744
01:06:40,287 --> 01:06:42,497
- Packard sawmill?
- Yeah.

745
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,165
Where's Mr. Packard?

746
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,167
Died in a boating accident last year.

747
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:48,211
Andrew Packard
practically built this town.

748
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:50,463
Brought her over from Hong Kong
six years ago.

749
01:06:50,631 --> 01:06:54,259
Left her everything,
which didn't exactly please his sister.

750
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,219
That's her right there.

751
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:58,096
The original deep freeze.

752
01:06:58,264 --> 01:07:00,348
Who's the glad-handing dandy?

753
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,727
Benjamin Horne. Local bigwig.
He owns half the town.

754
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:07,564
He's not after her,
he's after her land.

755
01:07:14,488 --> 01:07:15,613
Who's the lady with the log?

756
01:07:15,781 --> 01:07:17,115
We call her the Log Lady.

757
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:18,366
Shh!

758
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:32,213
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I could have your attention.

759
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:37,093
Is this thing on?

760
01:07:37,261 --> 01:07:39,387
- Is this thing on?
- Hang on, Dwayne.

761
01:07:41,932 --> 01:07:43,933
Sorry. Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

762
01:07:44,101 --> 01:07:47,270
Thank you, Mayor Milford.

763
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:48,480
Agent Cooper?

764
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:55,361
Thank you, sheriff.

765
01:07:55,821 --> 01:07:56,863
Ladies and gentlemen,

766
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:59,741
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Special Agent Dale Cooper.

767
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:02,619
One year ago, almost to the day,

768
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:04,829
in a town in the southwest corner
of this state,

769
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:08,124
the body of a young girl named
Teresa Banks was found.

770
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:11,795
She had no family. No one
came forward to claim her body.

771
01:08:11,962 --> 01:08:16,132
It wasn't even news. Until today.

772
01:08:16,717 --> 01:08:20,470
There are irrefutable similarities that
for obvious reasons I cannot discuss

773
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:23,139
that lead us to conclude
that Laura Palmer was the second,

774
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:26,935
and Ronette Pulaski would have been
the third, victim of the same killer.

775
01:08:29,146 --> 01:08:30,355
Now, there is a chance

776
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:32,482
that the person
who committed these crimes

777
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:37,320
is someone from this town,
possibly even someone you know.

778
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:39,531
You are the leaders
of this community.

779
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:42,867
It is vitally important
that this not turn into a witch hunt.

780
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:46,037
I would strongly suggest
a temporary curfew

781
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:48,039
for those under 18 years of age.

782
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:52,126
Keeping your kids off the streets now
may teach them a degree of caution

783
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:55,964
that may protect them in the days
and the weeks to come.

784
01:08:56,131 --> 01:09:00,510
I will remind you
that these crimes occurred at night.

785
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:20,947
When I left the house,
Sarah was sleeping.

786
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:23,992
Leland made it
through the day somehow.

787
01:09:24,159 --> 01:09:26,494
I'm not sure
I could've done the same.

788
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:30,456
Poor dear. Poor Sarah.

789
01:09:30,624 --> 01:09:36,671
Eileen, the brutality,
the madness of it.

790
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:38,673
I know.

791
01:09:39,174 --> 01:09:44,470
They're not releasing many details,
wisely, I suppose.

792
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:49,434
At the scene where it happened...
No one else knows this.

793
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:51,853
- They found part of a necklace.

794
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:54,647
Half of a golden heart.

795
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:57,025
It was Laura's.

796
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:59,235
They know this
because she was wearing it

797
01:09:59,403 --> 01:10:02,697
in a video of a picnic they found.

798
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:05,283
The reason I'm telling you this

799
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:08,578
is that Donna
was in the video with her,

800
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:11,706
and she won't tell them who shot it
or who else was with them.

801
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:13,207
What?

802
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:18,004
But they think the killer
may have the other half of the heart.

803
01:10:29,975 --> 01:10:34,145
Donna, which do you like better:

804
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:41,319
"The blossom of the evening"
or "the full flower of the evening"?

805
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:46,324
Now, listen to me. This is serious.

806
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:49,243
- Well, this is serious too.
- Shh.

807
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:51,037
I'm going out the window
in a few minutes

808
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:52,580
and I need you to cover for me.

809
01:10:52,748 --> 01:10:54,457
Aren't you aware
that there's a curfew?

810
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:56,084
They just announced it on the radio.

811
01:10:56,251 --> 01:11:00,046
Yes, I know there's a curfew, Einstein.
That's why I need you to cover for me.

812
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:03,675
I suppose this will include
a phone conversation with Mike,

813
01:11:03,842 --> 01:11:06,719
Mr. Bonehead-Boyfriend.

814
01:11:07,262 --> 01:11:09,764
No, this is about Laura.

815
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:12,642
And it's really, really serious.

816
01:11:14,186 --> 01:11:16,104
Check.

817
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:20,108
- Okay, thank you.
- Ha, ha.

818
01:11:38,293 --> 01:11:39,961
Oh, I'll need to borrow your bike.

819
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:42,630
Oh, well, then put a little air
in the back tire, would you?

820
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:46,509
Yeah. Harriet,
don't forget to brush your teeth.

821
01:11:52,266 --> 01:11:54,475
Actually,

822
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:59,147
now that some time has passed,

823
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:03,693
I like "the full blossom
of the evening."

824
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:14,912
Hey, Snake!

825
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:18,499
Don't take any oink-oink
off that pretty pig.

826
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:21,586
Don't you worry about that.

827
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:36,517
Hi, Dr. Hayward.
I'd, uh, like to talk to Donna.

828
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:39,729
Donna's upstairs
getting ready for bed, Mike.

829
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:44,609
You're not drinking and driving,
are you?

830
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:49,113
Well, we're all pretty broken up
about what happened today, sir.

831
01:12:49,281 --> 01:12:52,241
Besides,
Bobby's doing most of the driving.

832
01:12:53,452 --> 01:12:55,661
I'll see if she wants to come down.

833
01:12:55,829 --> 01:12:59,540
Mike, would you mind
waiting out here, please?

834
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:10,093
The best-laid plans
of mice and men.

835
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,472
Snake, man. Let's go!

836
01:13:33,408 --> 01:13:35,785
Where's your sister?

837
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:41,082
Dad, I'm gonna tell it to you
and I'm gonna tell it to you straight.

838
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,417
Harriet.

839
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:46,796
See that window?

840
01:13:47,714 --> 01:13:49,632
Later.

841
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:57,181
Donna's not here.

842
01:13:57,349 --> 01:13:58,933
What do you mean? She snuck out?

843
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:01,018
Maybe you have an idea
where she might have gone.

844
01:14:01,186 --> 01:14:02,687
Maybe you can help us find her.

845
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:05,815
Oh, we'll find her.
Don't you worry about that.

846
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:12,029
Roadhouse.

847
01:14:13,448 --> 01:14:15,116
Let's go.

848
01:14:24,918 --> 01:14:27,295
Sheriff, I got a call for you
from Dr. Hayward.

849
01:14:27,462 --> 01:14:30,631
I explained to him that you were
on a stakeout at the Roadhouse

850
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:33,968
but he still would very much like
to talk to you.

851
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:35,845
Go ahead, Lucy, patch him through.

852
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:39,682
I'm gonna patch him through
to you now, sheriff.

853
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:44,562
I'm patching you through now,
Dr. Hayward.

854
01:14:45,022 --> 01:14:46,689
Harry, my daughter Donna

855
01:14:46,857 --> 01:14:47,899
snuck out of the house.

856
01:14:48,066 --> 01:14:49,859
I don't know where she's gone.

857
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:55,156
Doc, you rest easy now.
I'm gonna put out an all-points for her.

858
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:57,575
We'll keep our eyes peeled.

859
01:14:57,743 --> 01:14:59,243
Thanks, Harry.

860
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:01,370
You betcha.

861
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:05,166
Lucy, you take care
of that all-points now, okay?

862
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:07,210
All right, sheriff.

863
01:15:07,377 --> 01:15:09,045
Of course Donna snuck out.

864
01:15:09,213 --> 01:15:10,504
Meaning what?

865
01:15:10,672 --> 01:15:13,633
Meaning how else
is she gonna lead us to that biker?

866
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:14,842
Right.

867
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:27,355
Then I saw your smile

868
01:15:32,527 --> 01:15:35,821
This whole afternoon
I've been hanging drapes.

869
01:15:35,989 --> 01:15:38,616
- Drapes?
- Drapes.

870
01:15:39,326 --> 01:15:41,202
Lots of them.

871
01:15:41,828 --> 01:15:43,371
You know how I feel about you, Ed.

872
01:15:43,538 --> 01:15:46,874
Don't do it for me, do it for yourself.

873
01:15:47,542 --> 01:15:50,544
- It's Tammy Wynette time, darling.
- Yeah?

874
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:52,880
What about you and Hank?

875
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:58,261
I told you, I'm gonna leave Hank.

876
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,471
Before or after he gets paroled?

877
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:07,311
I love you, Ed.

878
01:16:07,896 --> 01:16:09,563
I'm gonna do what's best
for both of us.

879
01:16:11,149 --> 01:16:13,901
When your sweetheart's husband's
in the joint for manslaughter,

880
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:15,945
the word "parole"
has got a nasty ring to it.

881
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:22,076
Falling

882
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:25,454
Falling

883
01:16:25,622 --> 01:16:35,089
Are we falling in love?

884
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,344
You know why I'm whittling?

885
01:16:40,512 --> 01:16:44,849
Okay, I'll bite again.
Why are you whittling?

886
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:46,434
Because that's what you do
in a town

887
01:16:46,601 --> 01:16:50,646
where a yellow light
still means slow down, not speed up.

888
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:00,948
Mike and Bobby.

889
01:17:01,533 --> 01:17:04,452
They're liable
to be a little trouble this evening.

890
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:13,627
There is a love

891
01:17:14,629 --> 01:17:19,050
Meant for me

892
01:17:19,217 --> 01:17:21,886
The nightingale

893
01:17:24,097 --> 01:17:28,851
It flew to me

894
01:17:29,019 --> 01:17:32,063
And told me

895
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:39,904
That it found my love

896
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:45,701
Scotty, Mutt and Jeff just crawled in.

897
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:51,999
Oh, what a wonderful world.

898
01:17:56,421 --> 01:17:57,838
Looks like sooner than later.

899
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:05,054
Why don't you whistle
for a little backup?

900
01:18:05,555 --> 01:18:07,515
I can see
which way the wind's blowing.

901
01:18:07,682 --> 01:18:11,519
Lucy, get us a backup unit down here
at the Roadhouse right away.

902
01:18:11,686 --> 01:18:13,062
Make that two backup units.

903
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:17,316
And call Dr. Hayward. Tell him
we found his daughter and she's fine.

904
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:19,693
All right, sheriff.

905
01:18:35,001 --> 01:18:36,627
Donna!

906
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:40,589
What are you sneaking around for?
Everybody's looking for you.

907
01:18:47,639 --> 01:18:50,057
- You and Laura, you're the same.
- Get your hands off me!

908
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:51,809
Leave me alone. Get off me!

909
01:18:51,977 --> 01:18:54,019
- No!
- Get your hands off me!

910
01:18:54,187 --> 01:18:55,563
Let go of me!

911
01:18:55,730 --> 01:18:57,731
- No!
- That's enough!

912
01:18:58,275 --> 01:19:01,569
You heard him. Let me go.

913
01:19:02,446 --> 01:19:05,448
Lights out, Mr. Monkey-Wrench.

914
01:19:13,665 --> 01:19:15,749
- You guys got it covered?
- That's right. No sweat.

915
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:17,418
Don't worry, I'll take you to James.

916
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:26,260
Joey Paulson.

917
01:19:26,761 --> 01:19:30,139
- That's a J.
- No, he's taking her to somebody else.

918
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:33,767
I suppose you want me
to follow them at a discreet distance.

919
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:36,312
Harry, you're all right.

920
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:06,467
Hold on.

921
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:09,720
Do you think they spotted us?

922
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:12,473
Give me a doughnut.

923
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:33,577
Well, Harry, I think we lost them.

924
01:20:35,830 --> 01:20:38,666
Man, smell those trees.

925
01:20:38,833 --> 01:20:41,502
Smell those Douglas firs.

926
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:43,837
I think I hear them.

927
01:20:45,173 --> 01:20:48,008
- What's down there?
- An old logging road.

928
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:51,929
The only access is five miles back
at the Packard Mill.

929
01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:54,515
And I told Doc Hayward
his daughter was okay.

930
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:56,100
My fault, Harry, not yours.

931
01:20:56,268 --> 01:20:59,186
- Thanks, Joey.
- No problem, James.

932
01:21:21,334 --> 01:21:24,545
James, they're looking for you.

933
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:29,216
I'm gonna talk to them.
But I think they're gonna lock me up.

934
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:30,718
Why?

935
01:21:31,636 --> 01:21:34,471
I don't have an alibi for last night.
I was with her.

936
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:36,432
James, what happened last night?

937
01:21:36,891 --> 01:21:39,893
It was kind of like a nightmare.

938
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:42,104
Donna, she was a different person.

939
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:44,398
What are you saying?

940
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:47,901
I'm telling you, there were things
she was involved with.

941
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:52,906
Things she let herself get pulled into.
Things she thought you'd hate her for.

942
01:21:53,074 --> 01:21:54,575
She said,
"There are things about me."

943
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:57,244
She said,
"Even Donna doesn't know me."

944
01:21:58,955 --> 01:22:00,581
I knew her.

945
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:03,250
I knew her
better than she thought I did.

946
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:07,588
Donna, she said something
about a guy getting killed.

947
01:22:08,381 --> 01:22:10,507
- Who?
- She didn't say.

948
01:22:10,675 --> 01:22:12,760
But she said

949
01:22:12,927 --> 01:22:17,765
Bobby told her
that he killed this guy.

950
01:22:18,725 --> 01:22:20,934
Oh, my God.

951
01:22:21,102 --> 01:22:24,271
This is why I had to see you.

952
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:29,568
It all makes some kind of terrible sense
that she died, that someone killed her.

953
01:22:29,736 --> 01:22:31,445
I don't know, I can't explain it.

954
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:35,157
I didn't know whether
to believe any of this last night.

955
01:22:35,325 --> 01:22:37,951
I mean, half the time
she wasn't making any sense.

956
01:22:38,995 --> 01:22:40,871
I couldn't calm her down.

957
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:42,956
I could hardly keep her on the bike.

958
01:22:43,124 --> 01:22:48,796
We came to the light
at Sparkwood and 21, and she...

959
01:22:49,589 --> 01:22:53,258
She put her hands around my neck

960
01:22:54,219 --> 01:22:59,139
and she screamed she loved me.

961
01:23:01,267 --> 01:23:03,477
I looked into her eyes.
They were clear.

962
01:23:03,937 --> 01:23:08,732
It was like she was Laura again.
She was so sad.

963
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:10,984
She sounded so desperate.

964
01:23:12,654 --> 01:23:17,116
Then she ran off.
I let her go and she died.

965
01:23:17,283 --> 01:23:19,451
Oh, it's okay.

966
01:23:21,037 --> 01:23:24,415
It's not your fault, James.

967
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:27,668
It's okay.

968
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:33,424
James, it's all right. James.

969
01:23:46,271 --> 01:23:48,522
Oh, my God.

970
01:23:49,315 --> 01:23:50,691
I'm sorry.

971
01:23:53,153 --> 01:23:55,362
Oh, my God.

972
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:00,701
I changed my mind.

973
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:03,287
I'm not sorry.

974
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:27,060
James...

975
01:24:31,024 --> 01:24:33,484
Oh, James.

976
01:24:34,444 --> 01:24:37,321
Those are sirens.

977
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:41,575
I've got to go to the police.

978
01:24:42,452 --> 01:24:43,827
I don't have an alibi.

979
01:24:44,746 --> 01:24:47,414
After she left, I just rode around
most of the night.

980
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,751
James, the necklace
you gave Laura with the golden heart.

981
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:52,294
You have to give me the other half.

982
01:24:53,129 --> 01:24:54,171
Why?

983
01:24:54,339 --> 01:24:56,256
Because they found the half
where she was killed

984
01:24:56,424 --> 01:24:58,425
and they think the killer
will have the other half.

985
01:24:58,593 --> 01:25:01,053
If you go down there
with the necklace and no alibi...

986
01:25:01,221 --> 01:25:03,430
- What about you?
- I'll get rid of it.

987
01:25:03,598 --> 01:25:06,266
- No.
- I'll hide it.

988
01:25:06,434 --> 01:25:09,770
All right. We'll bury it.

989
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,939
Okay.

990
01:25:12,106 --> 01:25:15,400
- Right here.
- Okay.

991
01:25:47,517 --> 01:25:48,559
I'll take you home.

992
01:26:12,876 --> 01:26:15,168
- What goes around comes around.
- Around and around.

993
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:39,318
- That's not Joey, that's James Hurley.
- He'll do.

994
01:26:39,485 --> 01:26:43,864
James, stand away from the bike.
Stand away from the girl.

995
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:45,616
Put your hands behind your head.

996
01:26:46,242 --> 01:26:47,701
He didn't do anything.

997
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:50,120
She's probably right.

998
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:56,793
James...

999
01:26:56,961 --> 01:26:58,211
He didn't do anything.

1000
01:27:02,175 --> 01:27:03,717
Lucy, get an arrest form ready.

1001
01:27:07,347 --> 01:27:08,847
Doc, I'm gonna release her to you,

1002
01:27:09,015 --> 01:27:12,351
but I want her back up here for
questioning first thing in the morning.

1003
01:27:12,518 --> 01:27:13,560
All right, Harry.

1004
01:27:13,728 --> 01:27:17,397
Andy, Hawk,
put James back in Number 4.

1005
01:27:22,487 --> 01:27:23,904
James.

1006
01:27:24,572 --> 01:27:25,822
It's gonna be all right.

1007
01:27:41,005 --> 01:27:42,839
You.

1008
01:27:53,226 --> 01:27:55,852
We'll be back to check on you later.

1009
01:28:02,402 --> 01:28:05,070
Good night, officers.

1010
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:26,842
I'm sorry, Dad.

1011
01:28:29,512 --> 01:28:34,141
Donna, after what happened today,
I'm sure you understand

1012
01:28:34,308 --> 01:28:37,519
what you put your mother
and me through tonight.

1013
01:28:38,771 --> 01:28:41,773
But I also know you well enough
to know you wouldn't have done it

1014
01:28:41,941 --> 01:28:44,359
unless you had a good reason.

1015
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:51,658
But we also have another problem
facing us, young lady.

1016
01:28:53,327 --> 01:28:55,996
Where's your sister's bicycle?

1017
01:28:57,081 --> 01:29:00,083
Uh, I left it at the Roadhouse.

1018
01:29:00,251 --> 01:29:03,170
Well, we'll have to go get it.

1019
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:09,885
I understand you promised Harriet
you'd put some air in the back tire.

1020
01:29:10,053 --> 01:29:12,095
Yes, I did.

1021
01:29:14,515 --> 01:29:17,976
We're so thankful
to have a daughter like you.

1022
01:29:25,943 --> 01:29:28,528
A policeman's dream.

1023
01:29:28,696 --> 01:29:32,032
Yeah.
Lucy sets it up for us every night.

1024
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:34,159
Sheriff, is everything okay?

1025
01:29:34,327 --> 01:29:36,912
There's extra jelly doughnuts
for Agent Cooper

1026
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:38,705
and there's some extra decaf.

1027
01:29:38,873 --> 01:29:42,751
You know, Andy's been drinking
so much caffeinated coffee lately...

1028
01:29:42,919 --> 01:29:44,211
Thank you, Lucy.

1029
01:29:44,378 --> 01:29:48,173
You can go back to work now,
and no listening.

1030
01:29:48,341 --> 01:29:50,300
Sheriff, that reminds me.

1031
01:29:51,302 --> 01:29:55,097
Can you recommend to me
a good inexpensive hotel or motel?

1032
01:29:55,264 --> 01:29:57,933
Now, it doesn't have to be fancy,
and I mean that.

1033
01:29:58,101 --> 01:30:00,310
I can get you a good rate
up at The Great Northern.

1034
01:30:00,478 --> 01:30:02,938
Because, you know, I think
I'm gonna be here for some time,

1035
01:30:03,106 --> 01:30:06,316
and these motels,
they'll promise you a good rate,

1036
01:30:06,484 --> 01:30:08,485
and when you get there
it's a whole different story.

1037
01:30:08,653 --> 01:30:13,031
Now, all I need is a bed,
a bathroom, a telephone,

1038
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:15,659
and sometimes a television,
in the unlikely event that one day

1039
01:30:15,827 --> 01:30:17,911
I'll get a chance to knock off early.

1040
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:21,373
I can get you a good rate
up at The Great Northern.

1041
01:30:21,791 --> 01:30:23,500
Sold.

1042
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:26,419
Well, tomorrow comes early.

1043
01:30:31,467 --> 01:30:34,094
Diane, it's 12:28 a.m.

1044
01:30:34,262 --> 01:30:37,347
Looks like I'll be staying locally at a
place called The Great Northern Hotel.

1045
01:30:37,515 --> 01:30:39,558
Sheriff's getting me a rate.

1046
01:30:43,604 --> 01:30:46,648
When you least expect it.

1047
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:26,146
Hello, sheriff.

1048
01:31:27,982 --> 01:31:29,774
Hey, Jo.

1049
01:31:30,359 --> 01:31:34,321
I understand you wanted
to see the sheriff up here.

1050
01:31:34,488 --> 01:31:37,490
Yes, I did.

1051
01:31:38,826 --> 01:31:40,827
Right over here.

1052
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:54,341
He's here again.

1053
01:31:54,508 --> 01:31:58,803
Let's get together and talk about it.

1054
01:31:58,971 --> 01:32:12,901
All right.

1055
01:32:19,533 --> 01:32:25,538
It must have happened
about this time 24 hours ago.

1056
01:32:27,667 --> 01:32:29,417
I'm afraid.
