What is the cost of lies?

8
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:49,016
It's not that we'll mistake
them for the truth.

9
00:00:49,104 --> 00:00:52,984
The real danger is that
if we hear enough lies,

10
00:00:53,062 --> 00:00:56,102
then we no longer
recognize the truth at all.

11
00:00:57,605 --> 00:00:59,265
What can we do then?

12
00:00:59,354 --> 00:01:02,024
What else is left
but to abandon even
the hope of truth

13
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:06,694
and content
ourselves instead
with stories?

14
00:01:06,771 --> 00:01:10,901
In these stories,
it doesn't matter
who the heroes are.

15
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:14,519
All we want to know is:
who is to blame?

16
00:01:14,605 --> 00:01:17,185
In this story,
it was Anatoly Dyatlov.

17
00:01:17,271 --> 00:01:18,981
He was the best choice.

18
00:01:19,062 --> 00:01:21,062
An arrogant, unpleasant man,

19
00:01:21,146 --> 00:01:24,346
he ran the room that night,
he gave the orders...

20
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:26,348
and no friends.

21
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:30,098
Or, at least,
not important ones.

22
00:01:31,563 --> 00:01:35,443
And now Dyatlov will spend
the next ten years

23
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:37,561
in a prison labor camp.

24
00:01:37,646 --> 00:01:41,016
Of course, that sentence
is doubly unfair.

25
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,189
There were far greater
criminals than him at work.

26
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:50,899
And as for what Dyatlov did do,

27
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:53,349
the man doesn't deserve prison.

28
00:01:54,521 --> 00:01:57,351
He deserves death.

31
00:02:10,187 --> 00:02:15,097
But instead, ten years
for "criminal mismanagement."

32
00:02:15,187 --> 00:02:17,187
What does that mean?

33
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:21,021
No one knows.
It doesn't matter.

34
00:02:23,146 --> 00:02:26,686
What does matter
is that, to them,

35
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,981
justice was done.

36
00:02:29,062 --> 00:02:32,652
Because, you see, to them

37
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,440

38
00:02:38,896 --> 00:02:41,896

00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:10,096
-What about radiation?
-Obviously, down here
it's nothing.

353
00:29:10,187 --> 00:29:12,897
But in the reactor building,
I'm being told

354
00:29:12,979 --> 00:29:15,019
3.6 roentgen per hour.

355
00:29:15,104 --> 00:29:17,274
Well, that's not great,
but it's not horrifying.

356
00:29:17,354 --> 00:29:18,944
Not at all.

357
00:29:19,021 --> 00:29:22,061
-From the feedwater,
I assume?
-Mm-hmm.

358
00:29:22,146 --> 00:29:24,436
We'll have
to limit shifts

359
00:29:24,521 --> 00:29:26,611

but otherwise...

360
00:29:26,688 --> 00:29:29,268

I'll call Maryin.

363

Rest assured, we are all

445

446

malfunctioned,

447
00:38:28,354 --> 00:38:32,234
damaging reactor Building 4

448
00:38:32,313 --> 00:38:35,983
Now, I have spoken directly
to Deputy Secretary Maryin.

449
00:38:36,062 --> 00:38:38,312
Maryin spoke
to Deputy Chief Frolyshev,

450
00:38:38,396 --> 00:38:41,606
Frolyshev to Central Committee
member Dolgikh,

451
00:38:41,688 --> 00:38:44,978
and Dolgikh to
General Secretary Gorbachev.

452
00:38:45,062 --> 00:38:46,902
Now...

453
00:38:46,979 --> 00:38:52,229
Because the Central Committee
has the greatest respect

454
00:38:52,313 --> 00:38:56,273
for the work of the Pripyat
Executive Committee,

455
00:38:56,354 --> 00:39:00,354
they have asked me to brief you
on matters as they stand, so...

456
00:39:01,896 --> 00:39:05,646
First, the accident...
(Stammers) is well
under control.

457
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:10,980
And second, because the efforts
of the Soviet nuclear industry

458
00:39:11,062 --> 00:39:14,772
are considered key state
secrets, it is important

459
00:39:14,855 --> 00:39:18,185
that we ensure
that this incident

460
00:39:18,271 --> 00:39:20,351
has no adverse consequences.

461
00:39:20,438 --> 00:39:24,558
Now, to prevent a panic,
the Central Committee
have ordered

462
00:39:24,646 --> 00:39:27,516
a detachment of military
police to Pripyat.

463
00:39:27,605 --> 00:39:29,435
How large of a detachment?

464
00:39:30,855 --> 00:39:32,895

and four thousand men.

00:39:39,021 --> 00:39:43,021

but it's limited
to the plant itself.

468

-Petrov: No, it isn't.
-Excuse me?

469
00:39:46,271 --> 00:39:50,191
You saw men outside vomiting.

470
00:39:50,271 --> 00:39:52,101
You saw men with burns.

471
00:39:53,187 --> 00:39:55,557
There's more radiation
than they're saying.

472
00:39:55,646 --> 00:39:57,936
We have wives here,
we have children.

473
00:39:58,021 --> 00:40:00,731
I say we evacuate the town.

474
00:40:00,813 --> 00:40:02,563
Bryukhanov:
Gentlemen--

475
00:40:02,646 --> 00:40:06,856
Please, please.
My wife is here.

476
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:08,977
Do you think I would
keep her in Pripyat

477
00:40:09,062 --> 00:40:10,402
if it wasn't safe?

478
00:40:10,479 --> 00:40:14,099
Bryukhanov, the air is glowing.

479
00:40:14,187 --> 00:40:17,227
The Cherenkov effect.
Completely normal phenomenon.

480
00:40:17,313 --> 00:40:19,193
It can happen
with minimal radiation.

483

know the name of this place.

484
00:40:35,813 --> 00:40:39,403
We all call it
"Chernobyl," of course.

485
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,809
What is its real name?

486
00:40:43,271 --> 00:40:46,731
The Vladimir I. Lenin
Nuclear Power Station.

487
00:40:46,813 --> 00:40:48,863
Exactly.

488
00:40:50,979 --> 00:40:54,859

for the people.

492

For is that not the sole purpose
of the apparatus of the State?

493
00:41:19,563 --> 00:41:21,653
Sometimes, we forget.

494
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:25,515
Sometimes, we fall prey to fear.

495
00:41:27,396 --> 00:41:31,186
But our faith in
Soviet socialism

496
00:41:31,271 --> 00:41:34,191
will always be rewarded.

497
00:41:36,354 --> 00:41:40,614
Now, the State tells us
the situation here is
not dangerous.

498
00:41:40,688 --> 00:41:43,228
Have faith, comrades.

499
00:41:44,855 --> 00:41:48,305
The State tells us
it wants to prevent a panic.

500
00:41:48,396 --> 00:41:50,606
Listen well.

501
00:41:53,062 --> 00:41:57,272
It's true, when the people see
the police, they will be afraid.

502
00:41:58,605 --> 00:42:00,725
But it is my experience

503
00:42:01,896 --> 00:42:03,976
that when the people
ask questions

504
00:42:04,062 --> 00:42:07,352
that are not in their
own best interest,

505
00:42:07,438 --> 00:42:09,348
they should simply be told

506
00:42:09,438 --> 00:42:11,608
to keep their minds
on their labor

507
00:42:12,605 --> 00:42:17,475
and leave matters
of the State to the State.

508
00:42:19,146 --> 00:42:21,226
We seal off the city.

509
00:42:22,396 --> 00:42:24,056
No one leaves.

510
00:42:24,771 --> 00:42:26,901
And cut the phone lines.

511
00:42:26,979 --> 00:42:29,769
Contain the spread
of misinformation.

512
00:42:32,438 --> 00:42:35,228
That is how we keep the people

513
00:42:35,313 --> 00:42:38,483
from undermining the fruits
of their own labor.

514
00:42:41,521 --> 00:42:43,311
Yes, comrades...

515
00:42:44,605 --> 00:42:48,645
we will all be rewarded
for what we do here tonight.

516
00:42:50,979 --> 00:42:55,479

522
00:43:44,979 --> 00:43:48,189

523
00:43:49,521 --> 00:43:50,981
The large dosimeter
from the safe,

the 1,000-roentgen capacity--

525
00:43:52,979 --> 00:43:54,309
What was the number?

526
00:43:57,563 --> 00:43:58,773
There was none.

527
00:43:58,855 --> 00:44:01,725
The meter burned out
the second it was turned on.

528
00:44:02,563 --> 00:44:04,443
-It's typical.
-See? This is
what Moscow does.

529
00:44:04,521 --> 00:44:07,651

530

531
00:44:10,021 --> 00:44:11,981
from the military
fire department.

532
00:44:12,062 --> 00:44:15,022
It only goes
to 200 roentgen, but it's
better than the small ones.

533
00:44:15,104 --> 00:44:16,234
And?

534
00:44:17,479 --> 00:44:19,349
It maxed out.

535
00:44:19,438 --> 00:44:21,018
Two hundred roentgen.

536
00:44:23,521 --> 00:44:25,611
What game are you playing?

537
00:44:25,688 --> 00:44:27,098
No, I--I--

538
00:44:27,187 --> 00:44:30,807
I asked him, he took
multiple measurements,
he's my best man.

539
00:44:30,896 --> 00:44:33,556
It's another faulty meter.
You're wasting our time.

540
00:44:33,646 --> 00:44:35,396
I checked the meter
against the control.

541
00:44:35,479 --> 00:44:37,729
What's wrong with you?
How'd you get that number

542
00:44:37,813 --> 00:44:40,063
from feedwater leaking
from a blown tank?

543
00:44:43,563 --> 00:44:47,103
-You don't.
-Then what the fuck
are you talking about?

544
00:44:51,229 --> 00:44:53,099
I, um...
(Clears throat)

545
00:44:54,937 --> 00:44:58,437
I walked around
the exterior of Building 4.

546
00:44:59,479 --> 00:45:02,939
I think there's graphite
on the ground in the rubble.

547
00:45:03,937 --> 00:45:05,727
You didn't see graphite.

548
00:45:06,646 --> 00:45:08,556

-You didn't.

549
00:45:09,479 --> 00:45:13,269

Because it's not there!

550

553

I'd love to know.

559
00:45:51,146 --> 00:45:52,476
I can't.

560
00:45:53,354 --> 00:45:54,864
Are you stupid?

561
00:45:55,979 --> 00:45:58,769
-No.
-Then why can't you?

562
00:46:00,104 --> 00:46:01,694
I... (Stammers)

563
00:46:03,646 --> 00:46:06,266

it could explode.

566

From there you can look right
down into reactor Building 4.
