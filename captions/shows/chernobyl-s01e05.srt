Comrade Dyatlov's been
working per my instructions,

00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:26,551
and Reactor 4 output's been
reduced to 1600 megawatts.

lower power any further,

ten hours.

It's not the grid

Although,

ten hours,

200
00:16:02,176 --> 00:16:07,216
resulting in a nuclear disaster
on April 26, 1986.

The State calls witnesses
Comrade Khomyuk

202
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,255

Deputy Chairman of
the Council of Ministers

206
00:16:23,676 --> 00:16:27,216
and head of the Bureau
for Fuel and Energy.

207
00:17:01,092 --> 00:17:06,682
It began with, of all things,
a safety test.

208
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,680
Why was there need
for a safety test at all?

209
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,010
Reactor Number 4 was not new
when the accident occurred.

210
00:17:14,092 --> 00:17:19,642
In fact, it went into operation
on December 20th, 1983.

211
00:17:19,718 --> 00:17:23,678
Eleven days later,
on the last day of the year,

212
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,510
Plant Director Viktor Bryukhanov
signed this document--

213
00:17:28,593 --> 00:17:34,933
certifying the completion of
the construction of the reactor.

214
00:17:36,593 --> 00:17:40,973
As a result of finishing
the work before
the end of the year,

215
00:17:41,051 --> 00:17:44,801
Comrade Bryukhanov was awarded
Hero of Socialist Labor.

216
00:17:44,885 --> 00:17:49,545
Comrade Fomin was awarded
for Valorous Labor.

217
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:54,295
Comrade Dyatlov was given
an Order of the Red Banner.

218
00:17:56,217 --> 00:17:58,837
But their work was not finished.

219
00:18:00,384 --> 00:18:04,594
And this document was a lie.

220
00:18:04,676 --> 00:18:07,546
In order to sign
this certificate,

221
00:18:07,635 --> 00:18:12,005
all safety tests had to have
been successfully completed,

222
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:15,222
and yet, one remained.

223
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:22,429
A nuclear reactor generates
heat in the core here.

224
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:24,719
A series of pumps,
here and here,

225
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:28,261
send a constant flow
of cooling water
through the core.

226
00:18:28,343 --> 00:18:30,803
The core's heat turns
the water to steam,

227
00:18:30,885 --> 00:18:33,255
and the steam spins
the turbine here,

228
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,643
and the result is electricity.

229
00:18:35,718 --> 00:18:39,468
But what if a power plant
has no power?

230
00:18:40,343 --> 00:18:43,933
What if the power feeding
the plant itself is disrupted?

231
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:46,549
A blackout, equipment failure,

232
00:18:46,635 --> 00:18:49,425
or an attack
by a foreign enemy?

233
00:18:49,509 --> 00:18:51,299
If there's no power,

234
00:18:51,384 --> 00:18:54,264
the pumps cannot move
water through the core.

235
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:57,133
And without water,
the core overheats,

236
00:18:57,217 --> 00:18:58,717
the fuel melts down.

237
00:18:58,801 --> 00:19:01,221
In short, a nuclear disaster.

238
00:19:01,301 --> 00:19:02,971
The solution?

239
00:19:03,051 --> 00:19:06,971
Three diesel fuel
backup generators here.

240
00:19:07,051 --> 00:19:09,301
So, problem solved?

241
00:19:09,384 --> 00:19:11,014
No.

242
00:19:11,092 --> 00:19:13,642
Bryukhanov knew that the problem
was not solved at all.

243
00:19:13,718 --> 00:19:17,128
The backup generators took
approximately one minute

244
00:19:17,217 --> 00:19:19,507
to reach the speed required

245
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:21,643
to power the pumps
and prevent a meltdown,

246
00:19:21,718 --> 00:19:26,258
and by that time,
it would be too late.

247
00:19:26,343 --> 00:19:28,723
So we arrive
at the safety test.

248
00:19:30,426 --> 00:19:34,046
The theory was this:
If the facility lost power,

249
00:19:34,134 --> 00:19:35,974
the turbine,
which had been spinning,

250
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:38,761
would take some time
to slow down and stop.

251
00:19:38,843 --> 00:19:41,223
What if you could take
the electricity

252
00:19:41,301 --> 00:19:44,511
it was still generating
and transfer it to the pumps?

253
00:19:44,593 --> 00:19:46,183
What if the dying turbine

254
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:48,379
could keep the pumps
working long enough

255
00:19:48,468 --> 00:19:52,928
to bridge the 60-second gap
until the generators came on?

256
00:19:53,843 --> 00:19:57,723
(Coughing)

257
00:19:57,801 --> 00:19:59,261
Any questions?

258
00:20:00,718 --> 00:20:04,128
Kadnikov:
No. Continue, please.

259
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,970
To test this theory,

260
00:20:08,051 --> 00:20:11,011
the reactor is placed
in a reduced power mode--

261
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:12,682
700 megawatts--

262
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,340
to simulate
a blackout condition.

263
00:20:15,426 --> 00:20:17,336
Then the turbines
are turned off,

264
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:19,426
and as they slowly spin down,

265
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,299
their electrical output is
measured

266
00:20:21,384 --> 00:20:25,054
to see if it's enough
to power the pumps.

267
00:20:25,134 --> 00:20:27,384
The science is strong,

268
00:20:27,468 --> 00:20:32,508
but a test is only as good
as the men carrying it out.

269
00:20:33,801 --> 00:20:37,221
Now, the first time they tried,
they failed.

270
00:20:37,301 --> 00:20:40,051
The second time they tried,
they failed.

271
00:20:40,134 --> 00:20:42,804
The third time they tried,
they failed.

272
00:20:42,885 --> 00:20:45,885
The fourth time they tried

273
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:50,127
was April 26th, 1986.

274
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,843
Stepashin:
Comrade Khomyuk.

275
00:21:25,426 --> 00:21:27,426
(Breathes deeply)

276
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:29,259
To understand
what happened that night,

277
00:21:29,343 --> 00:21:31,343
we have to go back
ten hours earlier--

278
00:21:31,426 --> 00:21:34,926
April 25th, the day the test
was meant to take place.

279
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:36,259
By two in the afternoon,

280
00:21:36,343 --> 00:21:38,383
the reactor has been
lowered by half

281
00:21:38,468 --> 00:21:41,638
from its normal output level
of 3200 megawatts

282
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:43,928
to 1600 megawatts
and is stable

283
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:47,129
and ready to be reduced to its
final output level for the test:

284
00:21:47,217 --> 00:21:49,127
700 megawatts.

285
00:21:49,217 --> 00:21:53,177
But before they can proceed,
there is a phone call.

286
00:21:54,217 --> 00:21:57,217
Power grid officials in Kiev
say that they cannot afford

287
00:21:57,301 --> 00:22:00,681
a further reduction
in the electricity
until after midnight.

288
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,380
They are asking
for a ten-hour delay.

289
00:22:04,426 --> 00:22:06,296
This is the first
critical moment,

290
00:22:06,384 --> 00:22:08,844
the first link
in the chain of disaster.

291
00:22:08,926 --> 00:22:13,506
Competent management would have
insisted on canceling the test.

292
00:22:13,593 --> 00:22:16,593
These three men
allowed it to proceed.

293
00:22:18,301 --> 00:22:20,301
Why was this delay
so dangerous?

294
00:22:20,384 --> 00:22:23,054
It created two problems:

295
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:26,094
One of them is
scientific in nature...

296
00:22:27,217 --> 00:22:29,837
and the other is very human.

297
00:22:29,926 --> 00:22:32,046
This is the one
we will consider first.

298
00:22:32,967 --> 00:22:37,087
At midnight,
there is a shift change.

299
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,340
-(Men chattering)
-Hey.

300
00:22:52,092 --> 00:22:54,682
-Khodemchuk--
-Forget it.
Find another fool.

301
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,720
Toptunov, want to buy
a motorcycle?

302
00:22:57,801 --> 00:23:00,181
Brazhnik:
Toptunov?
He's just a little boy.

303
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:02,179
He's got more hair on his face
than on his balls.

304
00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:04,549
Hair? Is that
what's on his lip?

305
00:23:04,635 --> 00:23:06,635
(Men chuckling)

306
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,218
Leonid Fedorovych.

307
00:23:08,301 --> 00:23:10,891
Akimov says to come
to the control room
as soon as you can.

308
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:12,717
-Is he already here?
-He came in early.

309
00:23:12,801 --> 00:23:14,801
Something about a test.

310
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:19,967
-You see? Desperate.
-(Indistinct chatter)

311
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,470
Toptunov:
Sasha?

312
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:34,219
Ah. You know the test
they were supposed to run?

313
00:23:34,301 --> 00:23:36,891
The turbine rundown,
they tried it last year.

314
00:23:36,967 --> 00:23:40,377
They couldn't do it
on the day shift,
so they've given it to us.

315
00:23:40,468 --> 00:23:41,508
To us?

316
00:23:41,593 --> 00:23:43,183
-We don't know what--
-Akimov: Shh.

317
00:23:44,801 --> 00:23:46,891
-(Whispering):
We don't know what it is.
-It's fine.

318
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,087
We take it down to 700,
hold it there,

319
00:23:49,176 --> 00:23:51,926
the rest is Stolyarchuk
and Kirschenbaum, but...

320
00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:54,259
Dyatlov is gonna be supervising.

321
00:23:54,343 --> 00:23:56,843
I have to do something
I've never done before

322
00:23:56,926 --> 00:23:58,216
with Dyatlov looking
over my shoulder?

323
00:23:58,301 --> 00:24:01,181
Yeah, well, don't worry,
we'll do it together.

324
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:03,839
I'm looking at
the instructions now.

325
00:24:03,926 --> 00:24:07,466
Are we supposed to do
those or not?

326
00:24:15,384 --> 00:24:17,934
Yes, this is Akimov in 4.

327
00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:21,589
I have the manual
for the rundown test.

328
00:24:21,676 --> 00:24:24,506
You did it last year.

329
00:24:24,593 --> 00:24:26,973
Yes, in the program there's
instructions of what to do,

330
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:29,511
and then, well, there's
a lot of things crossed out.

331
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,053
What should I--?

332
00:24:32,843 --> 00:24:34,723
Well, what should I--?

333
00:24:36,551 --> 00:24:38,091
Are you sure?

334
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:40,886
Right. Thank you.

335
00:24:42,259 --> 00:24:45,049
He says to follow
the crossed-out instructions.

336
00:24:45,134 --> 00:24:47,344
So then why are
they crossed out?

337
00:24:47,426 --> 00:24:49,006
(Door opens)

338
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:56,466
We've been cleared
to run the test.

339
00:24:56,551 --> 00:24:58,301
1600. Good.

340
00:24:58,384 --> 00:25:01,554
Now, is it too much to ask that
you all know what you're doing?

341
00:25:01,635 --> 00:25:03,675
-Well--
-Yes. Absolutely.

342
00:25:05,051 --> 00:25:06,471
-Stolyarchuk?
-Yes.

343
00:25:06,551 --> 00:25:09,591
-Kirschenbaum?
-Uh, I haven't reviewed.

344
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:11,546
We only just
found out really--

345
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:12,925
There, review it.

346
00:25:13,009 --> 00:25:14,839
Or you can just
do what I tell you.

347
00:25:14,926 --> 00:25:17,966
I think even you,
stupid as you are,
can manage that.

348
00:25:18,885 --> 00:25:20,545
Well, let's go.

349
00:25:23,593 --> 00:25:26,053
I'm supposed to switch
the turbine off while
the reactor's still running?

350
00:25:26,134 --> 00:25:30,434
-This is not good--
-Shut the fuck up
and do your job!

351
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:34,299
Toptunov, reduce power to 700.

352
00:25:36,384 --> 00:25:38,554
(Whispering):
I've never done this with
the power so low before.

353
00:25:38,635 --> 00:25:40,885
(Whispers):
It's okay. I'm with you.

354
00:25:45,926 --> 00:25:47,716
Reducing power to 700.

355
00:25:48,926 --> 00:25:51,466
Khomyuk:
I want you to think
of Yuri Gagarin.

356
00:25:53,384 --> 00:25:55,894
I want you to imagine that
he has been told nothing

357
00:25:55,967 --> 00:25:59,717
of his mission into space
until the moment that
he is on the launch pad.

358
00:25:59,801 --> 00:26:01,891
I want you to imagine
that all he has

359
00:26:01,967 --> 00:26:04,677
is a list of instructions
that he has never seen before,

360
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,220
some of which
have been crossed out.

361
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:09,221
This is exactly
what was happening

362
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:10,931
in the control room
of Reactor 4.

363
00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:14,379
The night shift had not
been trained to perform
the experiment.

364
00:26:14,468 --> 00:26:17,218
They hadn't even been
warned it was happening.

365
00:26:17,301 --> 00:26:19,091
Leonid Toptunov,

366
00:26:19,176 --> 00:26:22,716
the operator responsible
for controlling and stabilizing

367
00:26:22,801 --> 00:26:27,971
the reactor that night was...
all of 25 years old.

368
00:26:29,217 --> 00:26:32,337
And his total experience
on the job?

369
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:34,126
Four months.

370
00:26:35,217 --> 00:26:38,177
This is the human problem
created by the delay.

371
00:26:39,092 --> 00:26:41,892
But inside the reactor core,

372
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:44,087
in the space between
the atoms themselves,

373
00:26:44,176 --> 00:26:47,426
something far more
dangerous is forming.

374
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:48,969
A poison.

375
00:26:50,635 --> 00:26:52,835
The time is 28 past midnight.

376
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:13,339
Comrade Legasov.

377
00:27:22,301 --> 00:27:25,181
(Breathes deeply)

378
00:27:33,217 --> 00:27:35,717
(Pushcart rolling)

379
00:27:50,384 --> 00:27:52,804
I'm pleased to see some
of my colleagues here

380
00:27:52,885 --> 00:27:56,635
from the Kurchatov Institute
and Minenergo.

381
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:59,088
But you don't need
to be a nuclear scientist

382
00:27:59,176 --> 00:28:02,216
to understand what
happened at Chernobyl.

383
00:28:02,301 --> 00:28:04,301
You only need to know this:

384
00:28:04,384 --> 00:28:06,974
there are essentially
two things that happen

385
00:28:07,051 --> 00:28:09,681
inside a nuclear reactor.

386
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,300
The reactivity
which generates power

387
00:28:12,384 --> 00:28:16,264
either goes up,
or it goes down.

388
00:28:16,343 --> 00:28:17,763
That's it.

389
00:28:17,843 --> 00:28:22,093
All the operators do
is maintain balance.

390
00:28:24,009 --> 00:28:25,889
Uranium fuel.

391
00:28:27,718 --> 00:28:30,758
As uranium atoms
split apart and collide,

392
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:32,383
reactivity goes up.

393
00:28:32,468 --> 00:28:34,678
But if you don't
balance the reactivity,

394
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,970
it never stops rising. So...

395
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:41,215
Boron control rods.

396
00:28:41,301 --> 00:28:45,931
They reduce reactivity
like brakes on a car.

397
00:28:47,468 --> 00:28:51,468
But there's a third factor
to consider: water.

398
00:28:52,843 --> 00:28:55,343
Cool water takes heat
out of the system.

399
00:28:55,426 --> 00:28:58,756
As it does, it turns to steam,
or what we call a "void."

400
00:28:58,843 --> 00:29:02,263
In an RBMK reactor of
the type used at Chernobyl,

401
00:29:02,343 --> 00:29:06,383
there's something called
a "positive void coefficient."

402
00:29:06,468 --> 00:29:08,218
What does that mean?

403
00:29:08,301 --> 00:29:12,761
It means that the more steam
present within the system,

404
00:29:12,843 --> 00:29:14,843
the higher the reactivity,

405
00:29:14,926 --> 00:29:17,966
which means more heat,
which means more steam,

406
00:29:18,051 --> 00:29:19,591
which means...

407
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:23,586
It would appear we have
a vicious cycle on our hands.

408
00:29:23,676 --> 00:29:26,546
And we would,
were it not for this--

409
00:29:26,635 --> 00:29:28,335
(Clatters)

410
00:29:32,176 --> 00:29:37,966
And we would,
were it not for this:

411
00:29:38,051 --> 00:29:41,471
the negative temperature
coefficient.

412
00:29:41,551 --> 00:29:47,551
When nuclear fuel gets hotter,
it gets less reactive, so...

413
00:29:48,801 --> 00:29:51,181
fuel increases reactivity.

414
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:54,219
Control rods and water
reduce it.

415
00:29:54,301 --> 00:29:56,591
Steam increases it,

416
00:29:56,676 --> 00:29:59,966
and the rise in
temperature reduces it.

417
00:30:00,051 --> 00:30:03,681
This is the invisible dance

418
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,590
that powers entire cities
without smoke or flame.

419
00:30:07,676 --> 00:30:10,966
And it is beautiful

420
00:30:11,051 --> 00:30:13,051
when things are normal.

421
00:30:14,343 --> 00:30:17,223
As uranium splits apart
to release energy,

422
00:30:17,301 --> 00:30:20,801
it breaks down
into a new element, xenon.

423
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:23,755
Xenon reduces reactivity.

424
00:30:23,843 --> 00:30:27,263
This is the poison
Comrade Khomyuk mentioned.

425
00:30:27,343 --> 00:30:29,303
When the core is
running at full power,

426
00:30:29,384 --> 00:30:32,384
it burns the xenon away
before it can cause a problem.

427
00:30:32,468 --> 00:30:34,588
But because of the delay,

428
00:30:34,676 --> 00:30:38,546
Chernobyl Reactor 4 has
been held at half power

429
00:30:38,635 --> 00:30:40,215
for ten hours.

430
00:30:40,301 --> 00:30:43,051
The xenon did not burn away.

431
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:48,764
It built up, poisoning the core.

432
00:30:48,843 --> 00:30:50,513
We're starting to lose balance.

433
00:30:50,593 --> 00:30:54,683
-(Coughing)
-At 28 minutes past midnight,

434
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,180
the reactor is now
primed to slow down.

435
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:01,759
And yet, in less than an hour,
it will explode.

436
00:31:01,843 --> 00:31:05,643
If you can't understand
how a stalled nuclear reactor

437
00:31:05,718 --> 00:31:08,428
could lead to an explosion,
I don't blame you.

438
00:31:08,509 --> 00:31:10,549
After all, you don't work
in the control room

439
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:12,375
of a nuclear power plant.

440
00:31:12,468 --> 00:31:17,888
But as it turned out,
the men who did

441
00:31:17,967 --> 00:31:20,177
didn't understand it either.

442
00:31:20,259 --> 00:31:22,429
(Computers humming)

443
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:27,636
Easy now.

444
00:31:27,718 --> 00:31:29,718
Take it down.

445
00:31:29,801 --> 00:31:31,891
Good. Like that.

446
00:31:31,967 --> 00:31:33,427
Dyatlov:
You should have
finished by now.

447
00:31:33,509 --> 00:31:35,549
We're following protocol
for reduction rate.

448
00:31:35,635 --> 00:31:37,255
You're procrastinating.

449
00:31:37,343 --> 00:31:39,893
There are ten other men
in this plant who would've
done it already.

450
00:31:39,967 --> 00:31:42,637
(Whispers):
Keep working.
You're doing fine.

451
00:31:51,635 --> 00:31:55,335
Kirschenbaum, come get me
when these old women are ready.

452
00:31:55,426 --> 00:31:56,836
Yes, Comrade Dyatlov.

453
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:17,717
Okay, very slow now.

454
00:32:17,801 --> 00:32:20,721
Let's ease it down to 700.

455
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,680
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow.
-I-I didn't move any rods there.

456
00:32:36,718 --> 00:32:40,378
-What is this?
-I'm not even touching it.

457
00:33:05,092 --> 00:33:07,762
We did everything right.
I think that maybe
the core is poisoned.

458
00:33:07,843 --> 00:33:09,303
Well, if you thought
the core was poisoned,

459
00:33:09,384 --> 00:33:10,554
then you didn't
do everything right,

460
00:33:10,635 --> 00:33:12,005
because you're
choking my reactor!

461
00:33:12,092 --> 00:33:12,972
Get it back up!

462
00:33:13,051 --> 00:33:15,341
Uh, I think
if we turn off LAC,

463
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:17,256
it may be possible
to get more control.

464
00:33:17,343 --> 00:33:20,183
-Do it. Go.
-Switch off local
automatic control.

465
00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:23,049
Go to global.
Leonid.

466
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:25,844
LAC disabled.
Global control activated.

467
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,426
What did you do?

468
00:33:34,176 --> 00:33:37,086
-I-I did what you said.
I switched--
-Dyatlov: Look at it!

469
00:33:38,176 --> 00:33:40,546
-Akimov: I don't understand.
-Dyatlov: Fucking amateurs.

470
00:33:40,635 --> 00:33:42,425
You stalled the reactor.

471
00:33:42,509 --> 00:33:44,339
How the fuck did
you get this job?

472
00:33:44,426 --> 00:33:47,046
-Comrade Dyatlov--
-You're gonna tell me you
did everything right again,

473
00:33:47,134 --> 00:33:48,644
you incompetent asshole?

474
00:33:48,718 --> 00:33:52,088
I apologize for this
unsatisfactory result.

475
00:33:56,885 --> 00:34:00,585
-What are you doing?
-We have to shut
all the way down.

476
00:34:00,676 --> 00:34:03,126
-No.
-We could be
in a xenon pit.

477
00:34:03,217 --> 00:34:04,587
We have to shut down
and wait for 24 hours.

478
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:06,796
No. We're doing the test
tonight. Raise power to 700.

479
00:34:06,885 --> 00:34:08,175
We can't raise
the power from here.

480
00:34:08,259 --> 00:34:09,839
-The rules--
-Don't talk to me
about rules.

481
00:34:09,926 --> 00:34:12,086
-If we fall from 80%--
-No, no. We fell from 50%.

482
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:14,466
-Akimov: Fifty percent is worse!
-The rules don't say 50!

483
00:34:14,551 --> 00:34:17,721
-There is no rule!
-Comrade Dyatlov,

484
00:34:17,801 --> 00:34:19,841
I apologize, but what you're
saying makes no sense.

485
00:34:19,926 --> 00:34:22,546
-Raise the power.
-No.

486
00:34:22,635 --> 00:34:25,585
I won't do it.
It isn't safe.

487
00:34:34,426 --> 00:34:37,296
Safety first. Always.

488
00:34:37,384 --> 00:34:40,384
I've been saying that
for 25 years.

489
00:34:40,468 --> 00:34:42,508
That's how long I've
done this job, 25 years.

490
00:34:42,593 --> 00:34:44,053
Is that longer
than you, Akimov?

491
00:34:44,134 --> 00:34:45,054
Yes.

492
00:34:45,134 --> 00:34:47,224
-Is it much longer?
-Yes.

493
00:34:47,301 --> 00:34:50,431
And you with your mother's
tit barely out of your mouth?

494
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:54,721
So if I say it's safe,
it's safe.

495
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,131
And if the two
of you disagree,

496
00:34:56,217 --> 00:34:58,127
then you don't have to work
here and you won't.

497
00:34:58,217 --> 00:35:00,087
But not just here.
You won't work at Kursk

498
00:35:00,176 --> 00:35:02,756
or Ignalina or Leningrad
or Novo-Voronezh.

499
00:35:02,843 --> 00:35:06,223
You won't work
anywhere ever again.
I'll see to it.

500
00:35:06,301 --> 00:35:09,051
I think you know
I will see to it.

501
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:12,009
Raise the power.

502
00:35:15,259 --> 00:35:17,179
I would like you
to record your command.

503
00:35:18,343 --> 00:35:19,683
Raise the power.

504
00:35:30,635 --> 00:35:32,675
(Breathing shakily)

505
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:36,639
Together, then.

506
00:35:40,217 --> 00:35:41,887
Dyatlov:
I wasn't even there.

507
00:35:41,967 --> 00:35:44,217
-(Voices murmuring)
-Legasov: What?

508
00:35:46,092 --> 00:35:48,592
I wasn't in the room
when they raised the power.

509
00:35:48,676 --> 00:35:50,636
If you weren't there,
then where were you?

510
00:35:50,718 --> 00:35:53,718
Comrade Legasov,
you are a witness,

I will ask the questions here.

512
00:35:56,384 --> 00:35:59,554
If you weren't in the room,
then where were you?

513
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,050
The toilet.

514
00:36:03,134 --> 00:36:04,804
(Voices murmuring)

515
00:36:04,885 --> 00:36:06,755
Stepashin:
The toilet?

516
00:36:07,718 --> 00:36:09,508
Comrade Khomyuk
interviewed everyone

517
00:36:09,593 --> 00:36:11,053
who was in the control
room that night.

518
00:36:11,134 --> 00:36:13,094
They all told the same story.

519
00:36:16,426 --> 00:36:19,176
"I knew what Dyatlov
ordered was wrong,

520
00:36:19,259 --> 00:36:22,129
but if I didn't do what
he said, I would be fired."

Leonid Toptunov.

522
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:27,844
One day before he died.

523
00:36:27,926 --> 00:36:29,836
No, Comrade Dyatlov,
you were in the room.

524
00:36:29,926 --> 00:36:31,676
You ordered them
to raise the power.

525
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,300
-This is a fact.

(Coughing)

530
00:37:29,509 --> 00:37:32,639
Do you know anything
about this town, Chernobyl?

531
00:37:34,092 --> 00:37:35,642
Not really, no.

532
00:37:36,801 --> 00:37:39,471
It was mostly Jews and Poles.

533
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:42,591
The Jews were
killed in pogroms,

534
00:37:42,676 --> 00:37:45,176
and Stalin forced
the Poles out.

535
00:37:45,259 --> 00:37:48,759
And then the Nazis came
and killed whoever was left.

536
00:37:48,843 --> 00:37:50,893
But after the war...

537
00:37:52,134 --> 00:37:54,344
people came to live
here anyway.

538
00:37:55,384 --> 00:37:59,094
They knew the ground under
their feet was soaked in blood,

539
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:00,886
but they didn't care.

540
00:38:02,217 --> 00:38:05,337
Dead Jews, dead Poles.

541
00:38:05,426 --> 00:38:07,006
But not them.

542
00:38:10,009 --> 00:38:13,179
No one ever thinks it's going
to happen to them.

543
00:38:14,551 --> 00:38:16,011
And here we are.

544
00:38:25,551 --> 00:38:27,591

545
00:38:27,676 --> 00:38:29,046

547
00:38:32,551 --> 00:38:34,761
They call it a "long illness."

548
00:38:34,843 --> 00:38:37,643
It doesn't seem very long to me.

549
00:38:37,718 --> 00:38:40,258

550

553
00:38:48,801 --> 00:38:51,591
I wasted it all for nothing.

how unconcerned I was?

I don't believe much that
comes out of the Kremlin,

558

The reactor is nearly shut down.

587
00:41:49,718 --> 00:41:52,338
The operators of Reactor 4
are locked on a path

00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,376
that leads directly to disaster.

They do not yet know it,

At 30 megawatts,
xenon is still being created,

592
00:42:03,843 --> 00:42:06,093
but none of it is burning away.

593

The reactor is
drowning in poison.

594

To make matters worse,
the reactor isn't hot enough

596

The only way to safely raise
power from this state

597
00:42:21,593 --> 00:42:23,893
is to do it very, very slowly

598

00:42:26,843 --> 00:42:29,383
But Dyatlov wants it done now.

00:42:41,134 --> 00:42:43,894
still, the power does not budge.

605
00:42:43,967 --> 00:42:46,677
So they begin pulling
them all the way out.

00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,550
There were 211 control rods
in Reactor 4.

Akimov and Toptunov
completely withdrew 205.

Of 211 rods, only six
now remain in the reactor.

As for the fuel,
it's gone cold,

611
00:43:10,967 --> 00:43:13,047
so the negative
temperature coefficient

is no longer weighing
down the reactivity.

613
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:19,586
But even still, the xenon
poisoning is so strong,

614
00:43:19,676 --> 00:43:23,836
the best they can do is raise
the power to 200 megawatts.

00:59:41,301 --> 00:59:42,761
And for what?

856
00:59:42,843 --> 00:59:46,643
Your testimony today
will not be accepted
by the State.

857
00:59:46,718 --> 00:59:49,758
It will not be
disseminated in the press.

858
00:59:49,843 --> 00:59:51,803
It never happened.

859
00:59:53,092 --> 00:59:56,052
No, you will live,

860
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,934
however long you have,

861
00:59:58,009 --> 01:00:01,719
but not as a scientist,
not anymore.

862
01:00:01,801 --> 01:00:06,341
You'll keep your title
and your office,

863
01:00:06,426 --> 01:00:11,336
but no duties,
no authority,
no friends.

864
01:00:11,426 --> 01:00:13,506
No one will
talk to you.

865
01:00:13,593 --> 01:00:15,513
No one will
listen to you.

866
01:00:17,468 --> 01:00:21,758
Other men,
lesser men,

867
01:00:21,843 --> 01:00:25,513
will receive credit for
the things you have done.

868
01:00:25,593 --> 01:00:27,893
Your legacy is
now their legacy.

869
01:00:27,967 --> 01:00:30,717
You'll live long enough
to see that.

870
01:00:34,134 --> 01:00:36,554
What role did
Shcherbina play in this?

871
01:00:36,635 --> 01:00:37,755
None.

872
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:40,383
He didn't know
what I was gonna say.

873
01:00:41,676 --> 01:00:44,756
What role did
Khomyuk play in this?

874
01:00:44,843 --> 01:00:46,303
None.

875
01:00:46,384 --> 01:00:48,894
She didn't know either.

876
01:00:50,259 --> 01:00:52,639
After all you've said
and done today,

877
01:00:52,718 --> 01:00:58,678
it would be curious
if you chose this moment to lie.

878
01:01:01,593 --> 01:01:03,473
I would think a man
of your experience

879
01:01:03,551 --> 01:01:05,891
would know a lie
when he hears one.

880
01:01:10,051 --> 01:01:11,341
You will not meet
or communicate

881
01:01:11,426 --> 01:01:13,586
with either one
of them ever again.

882
01:01:13,676 --> 01:01:16,176
You will not communicate
with anyone

883
01:01:16,259 --> 01:01:18,379
about Chernobyl ever again.

884
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:21,836
You will remain so immaterial
to the world around you

885
01:01:21,926 --> 01:01:23,716
that when you
finally do die,

886
01:01:23,801 --> 01:01:28,091
it will be exceedingly hard
to know that you ever lived
at all.

887
01:01:32,426 --> 01:01:34,256
What if I refuse?

888
01:01:37,426 --> 01:01:40,506
Why worry about something
that isn't going to happen?

889
01:01:40,593 --> 01:01:41,843
(Scoffs)

890
01:01:41,926 --> 01:01:45,926
"Why worry about something
that isn't going to happen?"

891
01:01:46,009 --> 01:01:48,259
Oh, that's perfect.

Legasov (On tape):

We are so focused on

we fail to consider how few
actually want us to find it.
