1
00:00:20,597 --> 00:00:23,795
This one is as crooked
as a dog's hind leg.

2
00:00:24,394 --> 00:00:26,392
Fire it in the vice this afternoon.

3
00:00:27,825 --> 00:00:29,024
Are those yesterday's field reports?

4
00:00:29,157 --> 00:00:31,022
- Yes, sir.
- I want them now.

5
00:00:33,688 --> 00:00:36,985
Three more units added to security
at Coastal Aircraft.

6
00:00:37,152 --> 00:00:39,850
No progress on the
Fairfax Insurance investigation.

7
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,215
We're working with their accountants
on the audit.

8
00:00:42,315 --> 00:00:45,279
Uh, Brooks and Wilcox are in court
this morning on the Monzio divorce.

9
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,211
Brooks anticipates no problem.

10
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:51,108
James case looking very positive,
no negative signs in sight.

11
00:00:51,308 --> 00:00:53,273
All men on surveillance
have checked in except Russell,

12
00:00:53,373 --> 00:00:55,172
but he's in Santa Barbara
and he's undercover.

13
00:00:55,272 --> 00:00:57,703
Let me have
the afternoon report at 5:30.

14
00:00:57,803 --> 00:00:59,269
I assume our guest has arrived.

15
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:01,167
Yes, sir, but Mr. Kennicut
isn't here yet.

16
00:01:01,267 --> 00:01:03,532
Well, he's not due
for another 30 seconds.

17
00:01:42,838 --> 00:01:45,069
He's just coming in now.

18
00:01:45,803 --> 00:01:50,000
<i>I want you to listen
very care fully please.</i>

19
00:02:00,558 --> 00:02:03,357
My name is Arthur Kennicut.
Mr. Brimmer's expecting me.

20
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,821
Oh, yes, sir.
Would you go right in, please?

21
00:02:05,921 --> 00:02:07,020
Thank you.

22
00:02:11,617 --> 00:02:15,914
Oh, Mr. Kennicut.
You're right on time.

23
00:02:16,213 --> 00:02:17,913
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

24
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,411
Would you care
for something to drink?

25
00:02:19,512 --> 00:02:21,810
Oh. Some coffee, black.

26
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:25,040
I was just reading one of your papers.
I see you've taken a stand on this...

27
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:27,506
federal judgeship that's
giving everybody fits.

28
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,403
I'd rather not talk politics right now,
Mr. Brimmer, if you don't mind.

29
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,535
Yes, of course.
Thank you, Henry.

30
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:40,963
Well, this is your wife's file,
Mr. Kennicut,

31
00:02:41,063 --> 00:02:44,660
and the fact sheet shows
five weeks now of...

32
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,326
<i>intensive surveillance.</i>

33
00:02:46,426 --> 00:02:50,622
<i>All movement, personal contact,
telephone communications.</i>

34
00:02:51,056 --> 00:02:52,954
It's really quite extensive.

35
00:02:53,054 --> 00:02:56,052
And, Mr. Kennicut,

36
00:02:56,152 --> 00:02:58,617
you have nothing to worry about.
It's a clean bill of health.

37
00:02:59,217 --> 00:03:00,282
You sure?

38
00:03:00,382 --> 00:03:02,180
Well, I'm not in the habit
of making mistakes.

39
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,279
Yes. I'm sorry, of course.

40
00:03:04,612 --> 00:03:08,176
But lately it's been like
waiting for a biopsy report...

41
00:03:08,276 --> 00:03:10,142
benign or malignant.

42
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:12,507
Well, in this case, benign.

43
00:03:13,872 --> 00:03:17,803
I don't know which I feel most,
relief or anger.

44
00:03:18,203 --> 00:03:22,300
- Anger?
- At myself, my idiotic suspicions.

45
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:25,098
But I suppose when one marries a...

46
00:03:25,198 --> 00:03:28,162
<i>much younger woman, one tends to become
a little paranoid.</i>

47
00:03:28,262 --> 00:03:31,426
<i>Well, some times there's good cause.
In this case, not.</i>

48
00:03:31,526 --> 00:03:34,857
Read it at your leisure.
There's not a hint of another man.

49
00:03:38,288 --> 00:03:39,821
You know, it's funny.

50
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:43,751
I love her.
I love her very much.

51
00:03:43,984 --> 00:03:45,982
And I think I know her.

52
00:03:46,283 --> 00:03:51,312
But lately I could have sworn that...
Well, it doesn't matter now.

53
00:03:52,145 --> 00:03:55,142
I feel so guilty, I'm going to
start showering her with gifts.

54
00:03:55,242 --> 00:03:57,474
She won't know what hit her.

55
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,038
Mr. Brimmer,
I owe you a great deal.

56
00:04:01,138 --> 00:04:02,970
Well, it's a pleasure
to set your mind at rest, sir.

57
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:04,303
Thank you.

58
00:04:05,702 --> 00:04:07,634
And you'll have my check
in the morning.

59
00:04:07,734 --> 00:04:09,266
Very kind of you.

60
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:10,398
Thank you again.

61
00:04:10,732 --> 00:04:11,798
Thank you.

62
00:04:21,824 --> 00:04:23,423
Could you hear everything?

63
00:04:23,523 --> 00:04:24,921
Yes.

64
00:04:27,219 --> 00:04:28,585
Well, you seem confused.

65
00:04:28,752 --> 00:04:30,917
Well, I don't know why
you asked me to come here.

66
00:04:32,316 --> 00:04:33,648
I thought it was obvious.

67
00:04:33,848 --> 00:04:36,479
No, not really. You...

68
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:40,810
What you're trying to say
is that I lied to your husband.

69
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:44,207
Well, that's correct,
Mrs. Kennicut.

70
00:04:44,508 --> 00:04:47,272
I even went so far
as to falsify the report.

71
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,270
Would you like a glass of water?

72
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:52,702
No. Uh, nothing, thank you.

73
00:04:53,135 --> 00:04:56,766
In point of fact,
you were having an affair.

74
00:04:56,965 --> 00:04:58,231
The man's name was Archer.

75
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,429
It's over, Mr. Brimmer.

76
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,558
But I'm sure you already know that.

77
00:05:07,658 --> 00:05:12,720
It was a mistake.
A stupid mistake.

78
00:05:13,487 --> 00:05:17,983
But I ended it.
And it won't ever happen again.

79
00:05:21,314 --> 00:05:23,946
Why didn't you
tell my husband the truth?

80
00:05:24,811 --> 00:05:28,809
Oddly enough, Mrs. Kennicut,
I am a moralist,

81
00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:33,072
a vanishing species, so I'm told.

82
00:05:35,638 --> 00:05:38,569
A thousand broken marriages
come across my desk,

83
00:05:39,102 --> 00:05:43,165
infidelities, uh, domestic deceit.

84
00:05:44,564 --> 00:05:50,327
In your case, 10 years of marriage,
and one brief indiscretion.

85
00:05:50,426 --> 00:05:54,624
So, why not bend the truth
a little bit?

86
00:05:57,255 --> 00:06:00,986
Uh, then you're
not going to tell him?

87
00:06:01,086 --> 00:06:05,916
I haven't and I won't.
File's closed.

88
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,040
Thank you.

89
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:21,804
Thank you, Mr. Brimmer.

90
00:06:25,867 --> 00:06:27,733
I am so grateful.

91
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,029
How grateful?

92
00:06:36,594 --> 00:06:38,159
Mrs. Kennicut,

93
00:06:38,758 --> 00:06:44,688
a detective agency runs on information.
That's our raw material.

94
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:49,351
Your husband owns three newspapers,
two on this coast and one on the East.

95
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,749
Whenever anything happens on the
inside of business...

96
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:53,448
or politics or even in the jet-set.

97
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:55,980
I still don't understand how I...

98
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,742
Information, Mrs. Kennicut.
It is our only stock in trade.

99
00:07:01,842 --> 00:07:04,241
For example, at the moment
I'm working on case...

100
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,904
where in it would be very beneficial to
my client to have certain information...

101
00:07:08,004 --> 00:07:11,602
about a federal judge that
your husband is supporting.

102
00:07:12,101 --> 00:07:17,331
Are you saying that you want me
to be a pipeline to my husband?

103
00:07:17,431 --> 00:07:22,327
No. Just a good listener.

104
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,225
Is it really asking so much,
Mrs. Kennicut?

105
00:07:26,325 --> 00:07:31,588
I can't do this kind of work alone.
I need that kind of help.

106
00:07:34,052 --> 00:07:37,417
Why don't you think about it
and we'll talk again.

107
00:08:37,107 --> 00:08:40,771
Your terrace door was unlocked,
so I trespassed.

108
00:08:41,404 --> 00:08:43,103
Well, there's no car in the front.

109
00:08:43,536 --> 00:08:47,600
Oh. I thought you knew everything,
Mr. Brimmer. We're neighbors.

110
00:08:48,132 --> 00:08:51,697
My husband and I have a weekend house
about three miles from here.

111
00:08:52,662 --> 00:08:54,461
Ironic, isn't it?

112
00:08:55,427 --> 00:08:56,993
Why are you here?

113
00:08:57,825 --> 00:09:01,123
Well, why else?
To discuss your...

114
00:09:01,223 --> 00:09:05,054
What shall we call it?
Your proposition.

115
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:08,618
I've been walking on the beach
for hours, thinking.

116
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,149
And you've come to a decision.

117
00:09:12,249 --> 00:09:13,681
Oh, yes.

118
00:09:14,481 --> 00:09:16,445
Tell me something, Mr. Brimmer.

119
00:09:17,212 --> 00:09:20,509
How many other rich men's wives
owe you favors?

120
00:09:20,943 --> 00:09:23,874
Do they all capitulate easily?

121
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:27,205
I'm waiting for your answer.

122
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:32,167
Oh, indulge me. I should think
the blackmail-ee has some right.

123
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:33,201
Mrs. Kennicut, I...

124
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,698
The answer is no. No deal.

125
00:09:36,797 --> 00:09:41,328
Is that plain enough for you? If you
want a spy, you find someone else.

126
00:09:42,993 --> 00:09:44,525
All right.

127
00:09:48,023 --> 00:09:49,922
I'll have to call your husband
in the morning and...

128
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:53,553
And what?
Tell him I had an affair?

129
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,348
Sorry. It won't work.
I'm going to tell him myself.

130
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,244
I can't believe
that you'd want to do that.

131
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:07,708
Well, what you believe
really doesn't matter, does it?

132
00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:11,072
It's what Arthur thinks
that's important.

133
00:10:11,872 --> 00:10:16,302
Maybe he'll ask for a divorce
or maybe he'll forgive me.

134
00:10:16,702 --> 00:10:18,967
But it's time
I was honest with him.

135
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,466
You're being very foolish.

136
00:10:21,732 --> 00:10:28,161
Only if I lose. But you can't
threaten me anymore, can you?

137
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,125
You just lost your leverage.

138
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:33,457
Oh, and one other thing.

139
00:10:33,557 --> 00:10:37,387
I'm also going to tell him
about the way you run your business.

140
00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:40,719
I wouldn't advise that.

141
00:10:40,818 --> 00:10:42,483
Oh, I'm sure you wouldn't.

142
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:47,280
Because whether he forgives me or not,
he's gonna despise you for lying to him.

143
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,210
And Arthur's not the right man
to have for an enemy.

144
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,242
- Good night, Mr. Brimmer.
- Mrs. Kennicut, I want you to reconsider.

145
00:10:55,341 --> 00:10:58,506
Your husband has some
very powerful friends.

146
00:10:58,606 --> 00:11:02,835
That's right.
Now, if you'll please excuse me.

147
00:11:04,001 --> 00:11:05,867
I cannot permit you to do that.

148
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:10,364
Well, you don't understand.
It's not your choice. You let go of me!

149
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,295
Let go!

150
00:16:26,703 --> 00:16:27,869
What's the trouble, Officer?

151
00:16:27,969 --> 00:16:30,168
May I see your license
and registration?

152
00:16:30,401 --> 00:16:32,699
- Turn signal, right?
- The right one.

153
00:16:32,965 --> 00:16:35,597
You know, it's the second time
I got stopped today.

154
00:16:35,696 --> 00:16:39,128
I tell you, I'll get those things fixed
as soon as I can.

155
00:16:39,427 --> 00:16:40,727
You'll get 'em fixed now.

156
00:16:40,993 --> 00:16:44,124
I would, but I'm on my way
to a 187 P.C.

157
00:16:44,224 --> 00:16:45,257
Say, are you a cop?

158
00:16:45,357 --> 00:16:48,587
Uh, yeah, a lieutenant... Columbo.

159
00:16:51,852 --> 00:16:54,017
Well, I'm sorry, Lieutenant,
I flagged you down.

160
00:16:54,117 --> 00:16:56,382
Well, that's all right.
You're just doing your job.

161
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,047
Listen, I'll get those things fixed.

162
00:16:58,148 --> 00:16:59,946
This license expires next week.

163
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:03,043
Oh. Oh, well, thanks.

164
00:17:03,244 --> 00:17:06,008
Say, I better give you an escort.
That way you'll get where you wanna go.

165
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:10,239
Oh. Okay. Appreciate that.
But listen, not too fast.

166
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:41,983
Can't tell for sure,
but I don't think she was killed here.

167
00:17:42,082 --> 00:17:43,748
Looks like the body was moved.

168
00:17:43,848 --> 00:17:45,214
And the cause of death?

169
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,146
Probably a severe concussion.

170
00:17:47,246 --> 00:17:48,845
Print team all wrapped up, Captain.
Nothing.

171
00:17:48,945 --> 00:17:51,243
- There were two blows.
- Uh, send them on home.

172
00:17:51,342 --> 00:17:55,373
Laceration on the cheek and major
contusion at the base of the skull.

173
00:17:55,473 --> 00:17:56,805
How do you read that?

174
00:17:57,106 --> 00:17:58,171
It's hard to say.

175
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:01,268
Maybe somebody hit her and
she struck her head going down.

176
00:18:02,601 --> 00:18:03,301
Lieutenant, you got that?

177
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,566
I'll know more about this
after the autopsy.

178
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:08,497
Uh, yeah. Got a match?

179
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:10,728
- No.
- No tire tracks we can use.

180
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:13,560
- Got a match?
- I'm sorry. I don't smoke.

181
00:18:15,459 --> 00:18:17,391
No prints. Just smudges.

182
00:18:17,491 --> 00:18:19,556
- Money?
- Just change. No currency.

183
00:18:24,552 --> 00:18:25,784
You got a match.

184
00:18:25,884 --> 00:18:27,783
No, I don't. Sorry.

185
00:18:29,915 --> 00:18:31,214
Got a match.

186
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,712
Yeah, sure.

187
00:18:32,813 --> 00:18:34,478
We're all finished here.
You can load it up.

188
00:18:34,578 --> 00:18:37,409
Identification and purse.
Mrs. Arthur Kennicut...

189
00:18:37,509 --> 00:18:39,075
the Arthur Kennicut.

190
00:18:39,175 --> 00:18:40,274
How do you know that?

191
00:18:40,374 --> 00:18:43,039
Credit card's made out
to Kennicut Publications.

192
00:18:44,404 --> 00:18:45,670
What's the problem?

193
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:46,669
Newspapers.

194
00:18:46,769 --> 00:18:49,201
If we don't handle this according to
Kennicut's satisfaction,

195
00:18:49,301 --> 00:18:52,665
he's got an awful lot of front pages
to beat us over the head with.

196
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:54,930
Thought I told you
to move that out of here.

197
00:18:56,862 --> 00:18:58,628
Lieutenant,
what are you looking at?

198
00:18:58,728 --> 00:19:02,425
The bruise, sir. The lady has a bruise
on the left cheek.

199
00:19:02,525 --> 00:19:03,791
We know that.

200
00:19:05,322 --> 00:19:07,288
I knew you weren't listening.

201
00:19:29,705 --> 00:19:31,138
It's Lenore.

202
00:19:33,103 --> 00:19:34,368
I wanna get out of here.

203
00:19:52,689 --> 00:19:55,286
Oh. Thank you, Lieutenant.

204
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,219
Would you like to be alone
for a few moments?

205
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:00,283
No, no. I can feel sorry for myself
some other time,

206
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,382
after you've caught him.

207
00:20:03,681 --> 00:20:05,713
Well, should we get down
to business?

208
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,811
Are you sure
there's nothing else you want?

209
00:20:09,677 --> 00:20:12,541
As the husband,
I'm the most likely suspect, correct?

210
00:20:13,741 --> 00:20:15,872
You don't have to worry
about my feelings, Lieutenant.

211
00:20:15,972 --> 00:20:19,104
She was killed last night.
What time?

212
00:20:19,336 --> 00:20:20,901
Between 8:00 and 9:00.

213
00:20:21,735 --> 00:20:24,699
Well, I was in San Francisco
addressing a conference.

214
00:20:25,565 --> 00:20:27,963
I didn't fly back until this morning.

215
00:20:28,263 --> 00:20:29,929
Uh, you have the flight numbers on that?

216
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,626
My secretary can give them to you,

217
00:20:32,727 --> 00:20:35,691
together with my hotel
and my schedule.

218
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,423
You'll check them all out, naturally.

219
00:20:37,657 --> 00:20:38,589
Yes, sir.

220
00:20:38,689 --> 00:20:41,853
And when you do,
you'll dismiss me as a possibility...

221
00:20:41,953 --> 00:20:45,451
and then get down to the real business
of finding the real killer.

222
00:20:45,684 --> 00:20:48,415
And I want him found, Lieutenant. Soon.

223
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:49,481
I'll do my best.

224
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,313
I'm sure you will.

225
00:20:52,046 --> 00:20:56,976
Uh, Mr. Kennicut, it would help
if you could tell us a few things.

226
00:20:57,076 --> 00:20:58,575
Did your wife have any enemies?

227
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:02,272
Lenore never offended a soul.

228
00:21:02,938 --> 00:21:05,503
She was an extraordinary woman.

229
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:09,334
I see. This question is
a bit awkward, but...

230
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,399
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask it.

231
00:21:12,265 --> 00:21:14,830
Was there ever, uh,
another man in her life?

232
00:21:16,163 --> 00:21:18,961
Naturally. More than one.

233
00:21:19,893 --> 00:21:23,058
But that was years ago,
before we were married.

234
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:24,989
No, sir.
I meant since you were married.

235
00:21:25,089 --> 00:21:26,654
You're speaking of an affair?

236
00:21:26,888 --> 00:21:28,687
Well, I'm afraid we're gonna
have to consider it.

237
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:35,515
Well, don't bother. Lenore was
faithful to me in every way.

238
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,680
She had a clean bill of health.

239
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,976
All right. Clean bill of health.

240
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,408
So you don't think
we ought to go in that direction?

241
00:21:45,874 --> 00:21:47,073
No, I don't.

242
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:50,338
All right.
Can you tell us about her habits?

243
00:21:50,438 --> 00:21:52,403
What did she do in her spare time?

244
00:21:52,869 --> 00:21:54,435
Nothing unusual.

245
00:21:55,101 --> 00:21:59,065
Shopping, charity work. Sports.

246
00:21:59,165 --> 00:22:01,230
Sports. What kind of sports
did she play?

247
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:05,627
Oh, tennis. She was also
very fond of skin diving.

248
00:22:05,726 --> 00:22:10,157
Yes. Uh, did she do this with you, sir?
Did she do it with friends?

249
00:22:10,989 --> 00:22:15,020
With friends, Lieutenant. Female
friends, in case you're wondering.

250
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,152
Female friends.

251
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,716
All right, sir.
I think I've got enough to start with.

252
00:22:20,182 --> 00:22:21,515
Thank you very much.

253
00:22:23,614 --> 00:22:28,044
Lieutenant, I want you
to understand something.

254
00:22:29,076 --> 00:22:31,608
I married a woman
young enough to be my daughter.

255
00:22:31,974 --> 00:22:35,206
A lot of people were skeptical,
but it worked for us.

256
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:40,035
We loved each other.
We loved each other very much.

257
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,100
We even thought of having a child.

258
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,462
I want this man caught.

259
00:22:49,861 --> 00:22:52,760
And I must warn you,
I don't intend to be patient.

260
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:54,025
Yes, sir.

261
00:22:57,489 --> 00:23:00,920
Oh, Lieutenant.
Thanks for the coffee.

262
00:23:01,454 --> 00:23:02,653
You're welcome, sir.

263
00:23:39,026 --> 00:23:41,291
- Good morning, Lieutenant.
- Good morning, sir.

264
00:23:41,391 --> 00:23:42,890
Would you like some coffee,
some juice?

265
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:45,555
Uh, nothing for me.
No. Thank you very much.

266
00:23:45,655 --> 00:23:46,688
Any progress?

267
00:23:46,788 --> 00:23:51,017
Uh, no, sir. I hate to admit this,
but, uh, nothing.

268
00:23:51,117 --> 00:23:52,850
Not a single lead?

269
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:53,915
No, sir. Nothing.

270
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:57,013
Well, uh-Well,
some of my associates think...

271
00:23:57,113 --> 00:24:02,043
that, uh, your wife was mugged and the fella
ran away with the money. But, um,

272
00:24:02,376 --> 00:24:06,640
you see, they can't really explain
how the body was moved. And, now, me,

273
00:24:07,406 --> 00:24:11,969
I don't know.
I, uh-I think she knew the murderer.

274
00:24:12,502 --> 00:24:15,466
- Why? Excuse me.
- Yes.

275
00:24:17,632 --> 00:24:18,832
Yes?

276
00:24:19,664 --> 00:24:21,829
All right. Be right in.

277
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,293
Why?

278
00:24:25,526 --> 00:24:27,624
Well, her behavior seems
a little strange, sir.

279
00:24:27,724 --> 00:24:31,056
Uh, she went out to the beach house
in the middle of the week,

280
00:24:31,155 --> 00:24:32,788
which is unusual. And, uh,

281
00:24:32,887 --> 00:24:36,785
she said to the caretaker
she had some thinking to do...

282
00:24:36,885 --> 00:24:38,716
and then she went for a walk.

283
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:42,914
And then the next morning her body
was found on the other side of town.

284
00:24:45,579 --> 00:24:46,711
What are you getting at?

285
00:24:46,812 --> 00:24:49,543
I wish I knew. I don't know.
It's just that...

286
00:24:49,643 --> 00:24:52,574
it sounds to me
like a woman that has a problem.

287
00:24:52,673 --> 00:24:54,872
Now, did your wife
have any personal problems?

288
00:24:54,971 --> 00:24:59,269
- My wife was a very happy woman.
- Uh-huh. Yeah, well...

289
00:24:59,968 --> 00:25:01,634
It's just that
if she did have a problem,

290
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:04,465
I thought that maybe it would be
connected with the murder.

291
00:25:04,565 --> 00:25:05,597
But you've no proof of that.

292
00:25:05,697 --> 00:25:07,263
Oh, no, sir. No.

293
00:25:09,061 --> 00:25:10,394
Lieutenant,

294
00:25:10,894 --> 00:25:14,658
I call the City Room every half hour
to find out what you people are doing.

295
00:25:14,757 --> 00:25:16,556
So far, not a word.

296
00:25:16,856 --> 00:25:19,155
No arrest... not even a promise of one.

297
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,319
Now you tell me
you haven't a lead.

298
00:25:21,952 --> 00:25:25,849
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Kennicut.
Uh, looks like it's gonna be slow.

299
00:25:25,949 --> 00:25:27,848
It doesn't have to be.

300
00:25:38,907 --> 00:25:40,073
Lieutenant.

301
00:25:41,805 --> 00:25:44,803
Lieutenant Columbo,
this is Mr. Brimmer.

302
00:25:44,903 --> 00:25:46,136
- How do you do?
- Lieutenant.

303
00:25:46,235 --> 00:25:48,000
You've heard of
Brimmer Associates?

304
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,665
Uh, no, I haven't.

305
00:25:49,766 --> 00:25:52,364
Well, it's security and investigations,
Lieutenant.

306
00:25:52,464 --> 00:25:54,596
You might say you and I
are in the same business.

307
00:25:54,696 --> 00:25:55,528
Oh, really?

308
00:25:55,628 --> 00:25:57,228
Matter of fact, I was talking
about you just last night.

309
00:25:57,327 --> 00:25:59,792
I ran into the commissioner
at a party.

310
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,524
He speaks very highly of you.

311
00:26:01,624 --> 00:26:04,888
Naturally, you're wondering
why Mr. Brimmer's here.

312
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:08,220
Now, please don't take this
as a reflection on you,

313
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:10,485
but I've engaged his firm
to work on the case.

314
00:26:10,585 --> 00:26:11,717
Well, now, Arthur,

315
00:26:11,816 --> 00:26:15,581
I'm here in an advisory capacity,
a supplemental capacity only.

316
00:26:15,681 --> 00:26:18,679
I don't want the lieutenant to get
the idea that I'm competing with him.

317
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:21,077
But there's no reason why a private...

318
00:26:21,176 --> 00:26:24,208
agency and a public one
can't cooperate, is there?

319
00:26:24,575 --> 00:26:25,407
No.

320
00:26:25,707 --> 00:26:28,838
You see, I want as much coverage
in this case as possible.

321
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,669
And when Mr. Brimmer called
and offered his services,

322
00:26:31,769 --> 00:26:33,735
I thought it was an excellent idea.

323
00:26:33,835 --> 00:26:37,898
Sure, uh,
I can understand that. Uh,

324
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:39,230
you two know each other?

325
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,296
Well, Mr. Brimmer's done
some work for me.

326
00:26:41,396 --> 00:26:43,427
I see. I see.

327
00:26:43,527 --> 00:26:45,826
Some kind of security work?
Guards for the paper?

328
00:26:45,926 --> 00:26:49,056
Oh, it was a personal matter.
The point is, Lieutenant,

329
00:26:49,156 --> 00:26:50,222
I told Arthur on the phone...

330
00:26:50,322 --> 00:26:52,554
I couldn't imagine you wouldn't
accept a helping hand...

331
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:55,452
considering the manpower shortage
in your department.

332
00:26:55,885 --> 00:26:58,416
You see, Mr. Brimmer
used to be a police officer himself.

333
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:01,148
Well, it was a long time ago.

334
00:27:01,314 --> 00:27:04,245
But at least I can understand
your problems, Lieutenant.

335
00:27:04,345 --> 00:27:05,578
Well, now, listen, I...

336
00:27:05,678 --> 00:27:09,575
said to Mr. Kennicut I'm grateful
for all the help I can get.

337
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:12,339
I'm just not sure
how my superior's gonna take this.

338
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,305
That's already been taken care of.

339
00:27:14,738 --> 00:27:18,036
It's just that Mr. Kennicut is anxious
for a quick resolution to the case.

340
00:27:18,135 --> 00:27:19,102
You can understand that.

341
00:27:19,202 --> 00:27:21,267
- Well, naturally.
- Well, good.

342
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,398
I hope the association
will be beneficial to you.

343
00:27:24,631 --> 00:27:27,363
Oh, I'm sure it will. Yeah.

344
00:27:28,495 --> 00:27:33,159
You know, I suddenly feel very much
more optimistic about this whole thing.

345
00:27:33,358 --> 00:27:37,022
Uh, it's not based on anything,
no facts, but,

346
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:40,952
you know, I'm a superstitious guy.
You know, I believe in signs.

347
00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:44,949
I believe in palmistry and astrology
and all that kinda thing.

348
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:47,448
- You don't, I know that.
- Oh, definitely not.

349
00:27:47,548 --> 00:27:49,113
Let me see your hand.

350
00:27:52,011 --> 00:27:55,876
You see, Mr. Kennicut, that's your
fate line and it breaks there.

351
00:27:55,975 --> 00:27:58,007
That was your bad fortune.

352
00:27:58,107 --> 00:28:00,805
But it picks up again,
and that's interesting.

353
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,237
That's a very good omen.

354
00:28:03,836 --> 00:28:04,935
May I?

355
00:28:06,368 --> 00:28:10,032
Mmm. Deep line of Apollo.

356
00:28:10,332 --> 00:28:12,430
That's a man devoted to his work.

357
00:28:14,728 --> 00:28:18,559
Your Apollo line crosses the mound of
the Moon. You know, that's very rare.

358
00:28:19,258 --> 00:28:21,124
And very impressive.

359
00:28:21,524 --> 00:28:24,355
That's the sign of a man
who's destined to attain a very...

360
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:27,819
particular kind of distinction.
That's a very good sign.

361
00:28:28,785 --> 00:28:30,484
I know you think it's silly,

362
00:28:30,883 --> 00:28:33,248
but I'm gonna make a believer
out of you before I'm done.

363
00:28:33,348 --> 00:28:34,681
It was very nice meeting you.

364
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:36,779
- Nice to have met you.
- Bye-bye.

365
00:28:38,845 --> 00:28:43,341
Oh, Mr. Brimmer.
Large thumb, low mound of Venus.

366
00:28:43,441 --> 00:28:46,139
That means ambition, purposefulness.

367
00:28:46,872 --> 00:28:48,738
That's a closet, Lieutenant.

368
00:28:49,037 --> 00:28:51,369
Oh, gee. I'm sorry.

369
00:28:51,636 --> 00:28:53,234
A lot of people
make the same mistake.

370
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:58,098
Say, that's a terrific-looking
set of clubs. Do you mind?

371
00:28:58,198 --> 00:28:59,230
Go ahead.

372
00:29:02,794 --> 00:29:05,225
These seem light.
Are these ladies' clubs?

373
00:29:05,325 --> 00:29:06,658
They were Lenore's.

374
00:29:07,191 --> 00:29:09,090
You didn't say she played golf,
did you?

375
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:11,054
You mentioned tennis
and skin diving.

376
00:29:11,154 --> 00:29:12,753
That's because she just started.

377
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,052
Ahh. I see. Where'd she play?

378
00:29:15,418 --> 00:29:16,517
At the country club.

379
00:29:16,618 --> 00:29:18,149
I see. At the club.

380
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:20,715
Well, I was just wondering
why she just...

381
00:29:20,815 --> 00:29:22,447
didn't keep her clubs
in the locker room?

382
00:29:22,547 --> 00:29:26,243
She did. That's an extra set
she used to take lessons with.

383
00:29:26,477 --> 00:29:30,641
Oh, I see.
Well, that explains it. Right. Uh,

384
00:29:31,473 --> 00:29:34,238
you mean she didn't take lessons at her
own club? She took them someplace else?

385
00:29:34,471 --> 00:29:36,836
Sky Lane.
Why, is it important?

386
00:29:38,135 --> 00:29:40,101
It's not important. It's just...

387
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,331
I like to get that background
information very precise if I can.

388
00:29:45,064 --> 00:29:46,063
Bye.

389
00:29:47,596 --> 00:29:48,628
Is this the right door?

390
00:29:48,927 --> 00:29:49,961
Yes.

391
00:29:56,222 --> 00:29:58,853
Well, what was that all about?

392
00:29:58,954 --> 00:30:02,685
Well, I think, uh, police techniques
have changed a little over the years.

393
00:30:31,864 --> 00:30:33,429
Here, try it again.

394
00:30:33,895 --> 00:30:37,393
And remember, keep the back
of your left hand straight.

395
00:30:37,493 --> 00:30:41,956
None of this.
Just stroke it easy, all right?

396
00:30:50,983 --> 00:30:53,148
Oh, that was good.
You're getting better.

397
00:30:53,248 --> 00:30:56,512
Well, I still don't think
I'm ever gonna learn this game.

398
00:30:56,612 --> 00:30:59,111
Oh, you just have to
keep your eye on the ball,

399
00:30:59,211 --> 00:31:02,408
watch your concentration.
You're coming along fine.

400
00:31:02,508 --> 00:31:04,540
Do we have time
for another bucket?

401
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,739
Sorry, Jenny. Time's up.
Tomorrow, 3:00.

402
00:31:06,838 --> 00:31:08,137
Tomorrow then.

403
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,155
You a member of the club?

404
00:31:29,256 --> 00:31:33,986
Uh, no. No, I'm, uh, Lieutenant Columbo.
I'm from the police.

405
00:31:42,379 --> 00:31:43,545
What's the problem?

406
00:31:43,645 --> 00:31:46,610
I'd like to ask you a few questions
about a Lenore Kennicut.

407
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:47,876
Uh, you knew her?

408
00:31:48,642 --> 00:31:52,639
Not very well.
I gave her a few lessons.

409
00:31:52,739 --> 00:31:56,636
I see. Uh, well, this is
your appointment book, isn't it?

410
00:31:56,736 --> 00:31:58,834
Well, you should know.
You've been looking at it.

411
00:31:58,934 --> 00:32:00,700
Well, no offense.
I was just killing time.

412
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,131
But, uh, you know,
now that you mention it,

413
00:32:03,232 --> 00:32:05,497
I see that you gave her
a lot of lessons.

414
00:32:05,596 --> 00:32:07,394
She liked the game.

415
00:32:07,495 --> 00:32:10,959
I see. Well, look here's the thing.

416
00:32:12,158 --> 00:32:13,390
Since you spent
a lot of time with her,

417
00:32:13,491 --> 00:32:15,889
I was wondering if you could
give me some help.

418
00:32:16,455 --> 00:32:17,254
How?

419
00:32:17,354 --> 00:32:20,918
Was she the type of woman...
now this is just between you and me,

420
00:32:21,351 --> 00:32:25,115
was she the type of woman
who was on the lookout? I mean,

421
00:32:25,216 --> 00:32:27,514
did you ever notice her give her eye
to any of the men around here?

422
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:31,678
Uh, look, Lieutenant.
We better get one thing straight.

423
00:32:31,777 --> 00:32:34,741
I teach them golf
and I play in their tournaments,

424
00:32:34,842 --> 00:32:37,240
but I don't get involved
in their personal lives.

425
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:40,104
If they wanna pair off,
that's none of my business.

426
00:32:42,403 --> 00:32:45,767
Okay. All right.
Uh, well, thanks a lot.

427
00:32:45,867 --> 00:32:47,233
It's quite all right.

428
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:48,532
Take it easy.

429
00:32:49,165 --> 00:32:53,595
Uh, say, uh,
what kind of club is this?

430
00:32:56,226 --> 00:32:58,058
Oh, that's a number one wood.

431
00:32:58,724 --> 00:33:00,323
Number one wood.

432
00:33:00,889 --> 00:33:05,053
Listen, uh, could you
give me a lesson?

433
00:33:05,686 --> 00:33:07,585
- What?
- No, I'm serious.

434
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:09,850
You know what my trouble is?
I work too hard.

435
00:33:10,283 --> 00:33:11,515
Never out of the office.

436
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:14,313
I figure this:
if I could take up a sport,

437
00:33:14,413 --> 00:33:16,912
get out in the fresh air
and get some exercise,

438
00:33:17,012 --> 00:33:18,544
that'd do me some good.

439
00:33:19,143 --> 00:33:20,809
- What do you say?
- Well, I...

440
00:33:20,909 --> 00:33:25,539
Just for a few minutes. Just to,
you know, start to swing. Come on.

441
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,329
Say, you know
what was a funny thing about...

442
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:40,728
your appointments with Mrs. Kennicut?

443
00:33:41,294 --> 00:33:43,826
Uh, the first two
were in the morning...

444
00:33:43,925 --> 00:33:47,123
and all the rest,
and I counted 13 of them,

445
00:33:47,223 --> 00:33:49,988
uh, they were always in the middle
or the late afternoon.

446
00:33:50,088 --> 00:33:51,120
So?

447
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:54,885
Uh, well, I guess it's not important.
I guess it's nothing.

448
00:33:54,984 --> 00:33:57,250
Uh, wait a minute.
I'll take off my coat.

449
00:33:57,449 --> 00:33:59,348
Except that, uh,

450
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:02,812
now, every time you had
an appointment with Mrs. Kennicut,

451
00:34:02,912 --> 00:34:04,977
it was always
the last lesson of the day.

452
00:34:06,076 --> 00:34:09,540
I like to finish at a reasonable hour.
Doesn't everyone?

453
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,872
Oh, I see.
So those days, you left the club.

454
00:34:12,972 --> 00:34:16,169
I thought maybe you'd hang around to
see if you could pick up an odd lesson.

455
00:34:16,702 --> 00:34:18,434
Well, I didn't always go home.

456
00:34:18,534 --> 00:34:20,433
Oh, who said anything
about going home?

457
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,963
Oh. What I mean is I didn't always
leave the club. Sometimes...

458
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,994
Hey, listen.
Can I help you out?

459
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:31,025
Don't say anything else.
You don't have an attorney.

460
00:34:31,291 --> 00:34:34,989
Wait until you get an attorney.
This way you can hurt your case.

461
00:34:35,155 --> 00:34:38,253
Believe me,
I know something about my business.

462
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:41,751
I don't know nothing about golf,
you know. See that's your business.

463
00:34:41,984 --> 00:34:44,216
I know something about my business.

464
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:47,214
And believe me, you know,
down through the years, uh,

465
00:34:47,314 --> 00:34:52,076
you get so that you develop
a nose for things, you see?

466
00:34:52,176 --> 00:34:54,008
And, uh...

467
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:05,700
After a while,

468
00:35:06,233 --> 00:35:09,664
the old nose just tells you when
someone's not giving you the truth.

469
00:35:10,763 --> 00:35:12,296
Now, uh,

470
00:35:12,462 --> 00:35:15,793
I'm gonna forget about the lesson,
'cause I could never learn this game,

471
00:35:15,992 --> 00:35:18,092
but I'll be back to talk to you.

472
00:35:23,887 --> 00:35:27,018
Ground covered by the police
is not our concern.

473
00:35:27,118 --> 00:35:30,183
One thing to bear in mind,
money was taken.

474
00:35:30,782 --> 00:35:32,381
Granted, it could have
been a smoke screen,

475
00:35:32,481 --> 00:35:36,578
but sometimes the obvious answer
is the correct one.

476
00:35:37,278 --> 00:35:38,843
- Now, Brooks.
- Yes, sir?

477
00:35:38,943 --> 00:35:42,574
Check into her banking account with
particular attention to withdrawals.

478
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:44,839
See if you can find out how much cash
she was carrying that day.

479
00:35:44,939 --> 00:35:47,403
Mr. Kennicut will be
glad to cooperate.

480
00:35:48,203 --> 00:35:52,334
Now, my theory, gentlemen, and you will
gear your efforts in this direction,

481
00:35:52,434 --> 00:35:55,365
Mrs. Kennicut was walking
along the Pacific Coast Highway.

482
00:35:55,464 --> 00:35:57,697
She was forced into a car...

483
00:35:58,896 --> 00:36:01,760
by someone.
The motive was robbery.

484
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:05,524
She probably fought back.
In any case, she was killed.

485
00:36:06,223 --> 00:36:07,989
The murderer drove around
in a panic...

486
00:36:08,089 --> 00:36:11,720
and finally all the way out to here,
where he got rid of the body.

487
00:36:12,485 --> 00:36:13,218
Yes?

488
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:14,451
<i>Lieutenant Columbo to see you.</i>

489
00:36:14,551 --> 00:36:18,515
Who?
Oh, yes. Yes, send him in.

490
00:36:19,647 --> 00:36:22,412
Gentlemen, we'll finish this later.
I'll call you. Thank you.

491
00:36:45,895 --> 00:36:46,694
Lieutenant!

492
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,493
Come in!

493
00:36:52,057 --> 00:36:53,490
Whew! Boy.

494
00:36:54,322 --> 00:36:57,287
This is quite a building.
This all yours?

495
00:36:57,387 --> 00:36:58,552
'Fraid so.

496
00:36:59,252 --> 00:37:02,150
Must be a lot of business
for your kinda company these days.

497
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,348
Well, we can't handle it all.
Sit down.

498
00:37:04,448 --> 00:37:06,247
Uh, listen, your secretary called.

499
00:37:06,347 --> 00:37:08,679
She said you wanted to see
the files on the case, so I thought...

500
00:37:08,778 --> 00:37:10,311
it'd be a lot safer
if I brought 'em over myself.

501
00:37:10,411 --> 00:37:11,843
Oh. That's very nice of you.

502
00:37:12,276 --> 00:37:14,275
It wasn't necessary,
but I appreciate it very much.

503
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:16,040
- Uh, want some coffee?
- No. No, thanks.

504
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,939
Uh, those are the duplicates.

505
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:21,769
Okay. Yes, this will help.

506
00:37:24,567 --> 00:37:28,231
A lot of it. I wonder if you can
give me a little rundown.

507
00:37:28,564 --> 00:37:31,996
Well, it's just what I told
Mr. Kennicut. No leads.

508
00:37:33,061 --> 00:37:36,225
Except, you know, I was looking
through that stuff last night.

509
00:37:36,325 --> 00:37:37,625
Mm-hmm.

510
00:37:37,825 --> 00:37:41,855
And, uh, drives my wife crazy,
you know.

511
00:37:41,954 --> 00:37:43,753
Because we have the lamp right
next to the bed,

512
00:37:43,853 --> 00:37:45,452
and the poor thing, she can't sleep.

513
00:37:46,285 --> 00:37:47,684
Did you find anything?

514
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:51,115
No, not really. Well, uh,

515
00:37:51,847 --> 00:37:54,479
take the autopsy report.

516
00:37:55,545 --> 00:37:56,510
Yes. Here it is.

517
00:37:57,676 --> 00:37:59,076
You see now,

518
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:01,641
that jibed with something
that I noticed about the body...

519
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,239
the first time I saw it,
and that bothered me.

520
00:38:04,339 --> 00:38:07,970
Mrs. Kennicut was struck on the
left cheek, and she had a bruise.

521
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,768
And she had a weird kinda cut.

522
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:12,033
Um...

523
00:38:13,665 --> 00:38:14,531
Do you see what I mean?

524
00:38:15,297 --> 00:38:17,963
Um, no. I don't think so.

525
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:21,393
Well, let's start with the cut,
because that's what bothered me.

526
00:38:21,493 --> 00:38:22,459
I said to myself,

527
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:25,957
"Now what in the world
could have caused that kind of cut?"

528
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:29,254
Uh, does this lighter work?

529
00:38:29,887 --> 00:38:30,953
Yeah, I think so.

530
00:38:31,752 --> 00:38:32,785
Uh...

531
00:38:41,213 --> 00:38:43,910
- Uh, wh-where was I?
- About the cut.

532
00:38:44,243 --> 00:38:47,408
Oh, yes.
What could have caused the cut?

533
00:38:47,508 --> 00:38:50,972
I said to myself, "It could be a ring."

534
00:38:51,305 --> 00:38:55,635
A ring of... You mean a finger ring.
This kind of ring.

535
00:38:55,935 --> 00:38:59,766
Yeah, something like that.
Now here's the way I figured it.

536
00:39:00,232 --> 00:39:02,530
Suppose you were gonna
strike somebody.

537
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,396
Suppose it was a woman.

538
00:39:04,496 --> 00:39:07,726
Now, do you punch her?
Well, maybe.

539
00:39:07,826 --> 00:39:11,057
But more than likely,
you hit with your open hand.

540
00:39:11,157 --> 00:39:12,923
- Either this way or this way.
- Mm-hmm.

541
00:39:13,023 --> 00:39:17,053
Now, if you hit this way, then
the ring is not gonna cause any cut.

542
00:39:17,153 --> 00:39:20,983
So I figured it was a backhand blow
like this. All right?

543
00:39:23,649 --> 00:39:25,014
I still don't follow you too well,

544
00:39:25,114 --> 00:39:26,913
because that would,
that would put it over on...

545
00:39:27,013 --> 00:39:28,611
- But I used my right hand, you see?
- Yeah.

546
00:39:28,711 --> 00:39:30,544
And if the ring was
on the right hand,

547
00:39:30,644 --> 00:39:33,009
then the bruise would be
on the right cheek.

548
00:39:33,108 --> 00:39:38,337
But it was on the left cheek,
so the murderer was left-handed.

549
00:39:38,671 --> 00:39:40,336
Struck her like this.

550
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,234
Which means the murderer is
left-handed.

551
00:39:43,334 --> 00:39:45,000
Well, that's interesting.

552
00:39:45,566 --> 00:39:49,596
That's provided, of course,
all these, uh, speculations are valid.

553
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:54,126
Yeah, I would say that we have
a left-handed murderer, and, uh,

554
00:39:54,426 --> 00:39:56,092
and an unpremeditated crime.

555
00:39:56,358 --> 00:39:57,291
We have?

556
00:39:57,391 --> 00:39:58,890
Oh, I think so, yes.

557
00:39:59,123 --> 00:40:02,786
I mean, I don't think a man kills
with his hands unless he's angry.

558
00:40:03,419 --> 00:40:06,850
As a matter of fact, you know,
maybe he didn't mean to do it.

559
00:40:07,517 --> 00:40:08,883
Could be.

560
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,914
You know,
maybe it was an accident.

561
00:40:12,413 --> 00:40:15,644
You know, I got a feeling
that when we find our friend,

562
00:40:15,744 --> 00:40:18,409
it's gonna turn out
that he has a terrible temper.

563
00:40:22,073 --> 00:40:24,705
Well, maybe you're right.

564
00:40:25,071 --> 00:40:27,669
I certainly wish
I had your crystal ball, Lieutenant.

565
00:40:35,097 --> 00:40:38,628
Why don't you let me digest this
material, and then we'll talk again.

566
00:40:39,527 --> 00:40:41,758
Okay. All right. Fine.

567
00:40:41,925 --> 00:40:44,923
Sure. Listen.
I want to thank you for the time.

568
00:40:45,023 --> 00:40:47,288
- Listen. Thank you.
- Right.

569
00:40:47,388 --> 00:40:49,453
Oh, listen, before I forget, uh...

570
00:40:50,053 --> 00:40:55,583
Gee whiz. I didn't wanna forget that.
But, uh,

571
00:40:56,216 --> 00:40:59,513
let's see. I had a receipt here
that I wanted you to sign.

572
00:40:59,613 --> 00:41:03,710
Well, listen, let's just make one up.
It's a receipt for the files.

573
00:41:09,339 --> 00:41:13,369
Isn't that weird?
What a coincidence.

574
00:41:13,603 --> 00:41:14,635
What's that?

575
00:41:14,735 --> 00:41:17,034
Here, a moment ago, we were
talking about left-handed people,

576
00:41:17,134 --> 00:41:18,866
and you're left-handed.

577
00:41:24,994 --> 00:41:28,925
And right-handed.
I'm ambidextrous.

578
00:41:29,591 --> 00:41:32,689
That means I don't favor
either hand particularly.

579
00:41:32,789 --> 00:41:36,719
It's a character trait shared
by about 10% of the world's population.

580
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,118
Ten percent? No kidding?

581
00:41:39,218 --> 00:41:41,616
- Anything else?
- Uh, no.

582
00:41:41,715 --> 00:41:45,680
No, I don't think so. Uh, oh, listen.
This is a little bit off the subject.

583
00:41:45,779 --> 00:41:48,844
My sister-in-law, she wants to
buy a place out at the beach.

584
00:41:48,944 --> 00:41:49,976
How do you like it out there?

585
00:41:50,077 --> 00:41:51,575
Who told you I was living
out at the beach?

586
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:52,442
Well, no one.

587
00:41:52,542 --> 00:41:54,907
I-I noticed your car
out in front of Mr. Kennicut's.

588
00:41:55,007 --> 00:41:56,772
You know, you parked it there
in the driveway.

589
00:41:56,871 --> 00:41:59,336
As I was walking by,
I saw the chrome was tarnished.

590
00:41:59,437 --> 00:42:02,734
You know what the salt air does to it.
It just eats the life out of it.

591
00:42:02,834 --> 00:42:04,766
Yeah, that part's a problem, all right.

592
00:42:04,866 --> 00:42:07,798
Uh, you're a very observant man,
Lieutenant.

593
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,395
That's not what my wife says.

594
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:15,159
Well, you tell your sister-in-law
that she will love it at the beach...

595
00:42:15,392 --> 00:42:18,589
if she doesn't mind that problem
with the salt air on the chrome.

596
00:42:18,823 --> 00:42:20,921
I'll give her that message.
And thanks again.

597
00:42:21,021 --> 00:42:22,287
Thank you.

598
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:25,917
Oh, uh, say.

599
00:42:26,017 --> 00:42:28,183
Have you ever been
in Mr. Kennicut's house?

600
00:42:29,349 --> 00:42:31,480
Yes, I met you there.

601
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,678
No, I didn't mean the big house.
I meant out at the beach.

602
00:42:34,278 --> 00:42:35,778
I was just wondering, because...

603
00:42:35,877 --> 00:42:38,375
your beach house and his beach house,
they're fairly close, aren't they?

604
00:42:38,475 --> 00:42:40,640
No. It's a couple miles.

605
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:44,837
That close?
Isn't that a coincidence?

606
00:42:45,903 --> 00:42:48,601
I'll tell you,
this case is just full of 'em.

607
00:43:58,251 --> 00:44:00,350
Why don't you and I take a walk?

608
00:44:21,501 --> 00:44:25,099
When you showed up today,
I... I kinda panicked.

609
00:44:25,198 --> 00:44:27,297
Then you did have
an affair with her?

610
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:31,494
Turning on the ladies is about
the only thing I do well.

611
00:44:31,593 --> 00:44:34,426
- I'm not a very good golfer.
- Yeah, go on.

612
00:44:34,959 --> 00:44:38,755
Well, it was pretty good
for a while at least for me.

613
00:44:39,422 --> 00:44:41,154
She got the guilts.

614
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:44,785
Funny thing, I think
she really loved her husband.

615
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:47,083
One day she said,

616
00:44:47,183 --> 00:44:50,014
"Ken, this is bad for both of us.
Let's call it off."

617
00:44:50,114 --> 00:44:51,579
So we did.

618
00:44:52,112 --> 00:44:54,278
Must have shook you up
when we found her dead.

619
00:44:54,377 --> 00:44:56,143
I couldn't believe it.

620
00:44:56,776 --> 00:45:00,906
Then I got to thinking, sooner or later,
you guys would find out about me.

621
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,038
Maybe even think I killed her.

622
00:45:03,138 --> 00:45:06,902
The night she died, I was...
I was home watching the tube.

623
00:45:07,668 --> 00:45:09,999
No calls. No company.

624
00:45:10,766 --> 00:45:13,764
No alibi. That's...
That's why I started to run.

625
00:45:13,864 --> 00:45:16,895
Uh-huh.
I can understand that.

626
00:45:20,825 --> 00:45:21,891
You didn't kill her.

627
00:45:22,724 --> 00:45:26,288
No, no. I know that, but this afternoon,
you gave me the impression...

628
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:31,285
No. You're in the clear.
You got nothing to worry about.

629
00:45:31,684 --> 00:45:35,548
You see, whoever did this,
he had to wear a ring.

630
00:45:36,181 --> 00:45:38,280
Now, you don't wear a ring.

631
00:45:39,978 --> 00:45:41,610
Well, I could have taken it off.

632
00:45:41,777 --> 00:45:45,074
No, not with that tan,
because that would show.

633
00:45:47,406 --> 00:45:49,704
Now listen.
Tell me something.

634
00:45:49,905 --> 00:45:51,403
Mrs. Kennicut...

635
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:54,801
Did Mrs. Kennicut
ever indicate to you...

636
00:45:55,001 --> 00:45:58,331
that she was concerned that her husband
knew about you two?

637
00:45:58,832 --> 00:45:59,898
No.

638
00:46:00,796 --> 00:46:02,096
That's funny that you
mention it though,

639
00:46:02,196 --> 00:46:04,628
because, well, I was concerned.

640
00:46:04,727 --> 00:46:05,827
Why?

641
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:11,289
Well, Lenore never saw anyone,
but I'm sure we were being followed.

642
00:46:11,389 --> 00:46:12,455
By who?

643
00:46:12,921 --> 00:46:15,419
Well, there was
this one guy in particular.

644
00:46:15,919 --> 00:46:18,917
Sharp, well-dressed.
I only caught him in flashes, but...

645
00:46:19,916 --> 00:46:24,247
Well, he-he had a crew cut.
Kind of an ex-marine type.

646
00:46:30,176 --> 00:46:32,474
- Yes?
- Wilcox, Mr. Brimmer.

647
00:46:32,673 --> 00:46:36,005
The subject is meeting with Archer,
and they've engaged in conversation.

648
00:46:36,404 --> 00:46:38,502
Did you overhear anything?

649
00:46:38,603 --> 00:46:42,833
<i>No, sir. But Archer seems to
be doing most of the talking.</i>

650
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:45,898
Maintain the surveillance
and report to me in the morning.

651
00:46:46,264 --> 00:46:47,396
Yes, sir.

652
00:46:59,388 --> 00:47:01,653
Why, you little bum, you.

653
00:47:03,985 --> 00:47:05,250
Hello?

654
00:47:06,183 --> 00:47:09,148
Oh, yes, he is. Leo.

655
00:47:09,848 --> 00:47:11,279
Mr. Brimmer.

656
00:47:19,906 --> 00:47:20,573
Yes, sir?

657
00:47:20,773 --> 00:47:22,704
I'm sorry to trouble you at home, Leo.

658
00:47:22,804 --> 00:47:24,703
<i>No sweat.
Just playing with Teddy.</i>

659
00:47:26,136 --> 00:47:28,401
Well, I've got a little something
I want you to do for me.

660
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,133
It may complicate your life a little bit.

661
00:47:30,399 --> 00:47:33,463
- When?
- Immediately. Set it up through my secretary.

662
00:47:33,664 --> 00:47:36,029
Yes, sir. I'll be in touch.

663
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:50,118
Every one of our operatives
is a skilled marksman.

664
00:47:50,218 --> 00:47:52,516
Actually, our policy
is to avoid the use of the weapon.

665
00:47:52,817 --> 00:47:55,115
This is our memory bank, Lieutenant.

666
00:47:55,215 --> 00:47:57,180
Millions of bits of information,

667
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,510
all cross-filed and on tape,
immediately available.

668
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:04,808
There are more electrical impulses
in this room than in your brain.

669
00:48:05,607 --> 00:48:07,139
Hard to believe.

670
00:48:07,605 --> 00:48:10,371
We here at Brimmer Associates
use the most up-to-date equipment.

671
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,335
Years ahead of what you use
at police headquarters.

672
00:48:12,735 --> 00:48:15,400
Company cars...
custom designed for us.

673
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,597
Most of them with telephonic
or radio communication.

674
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:21,996
Phew! It's very impressive.

675
00:48:22,228 --> 00:48:24,027
Oh, uh, just one moment,
Lieutenant.

676
00:48:24,426 --> 00:48:26,659
One other thing
that might interest you.

677
00:48:26,758 --> 00:48:28,490
If you'll just move
past this gate.

678
00:48:33,487 --> 00:48:34,419
It's not working.

679
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,986
Well, it has to be.

680
00:48:36,718 --> 00:48:38,350
You're carrying a gun,
aren't you, Lieutenant?

681
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,282
- No.
- No?

682
00:48:40,382 --> 00:48:42,947
Oh. Well, that explains
the malfunction.

683
00:48:43,147 --> 00:48:47,011
Look here. A special system
is built into the gate.

684
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:50,375
Now, if you had a gun,
it would have registered.

685
00:48:53,539 --> 00:48:55,605
It's just like out at the airport.

686
00:48:55,705 --> 00:48:57,003
It's a security precaution.

687
00:48:57,103 --> 00:48:59,468
Not that we expect our clients
to be carrying concealed weapons,

688
00:48:59,568 --> 00:49:01,700
but, uh, well, there have been
a few exceptions.

689
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,466
Really?

690
00:49:02,566 --> 00:49:04,965
Well, a guy came in here
just about a month ago.

691
00:49:05,097 --> 00:49:07,763
Harmless looking.
An accountant for Mid-Century Oil.

692
00:49:07,863 --> 00:49:09,095
We were doing a company audit.

693
00:49:09,194 --> 00:49:10,027
Mr. Denning?

694
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:13,625
I asked you to show
the lieutenant around.

695
00:49:13,759 --> 00:49:18,788
I did not suggest that you discuss
our confidential matters...

696
00:49:18,888 --> 00:49:21,220
with anyone at anytime!

697
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:24,484
Our clients pay us to be discreet.

698
00:49:26,016 --> 00:49:27,215
Yes, sir.

699
00:49:30,846 --> 00:49:32,145
Won't you come in, Lieutenant?

700
00:49:42,238 --> 00:49:45,368
Sorry about the outburst,
but my people have got to learn.

701
00:49:45,469 --> 00:49:46,735
This is a business of trust.

702
00:49:46,835 --> 00:49:49,499
I can't have them gossiping
about the clients.

703
00:49:49,932 --> 00:49:51,264
Thank you, Henry.

704
00:49:51,364 --> 00:49:53,896
Hope you'll have lunch with me.
Like quenelle of sole?

705
00:49:53,995 --> 00:49:56,927
Uh, well, if it's fish,
I like fish. I love fish.

706
00:49:57,027 --> 00:50:00,158
Yeah, it's fish.
Drop your coat and dig in.

707
00:50:01,824 --> 00:50:05,121
On the Kennicut case, my men
have come up with an interesting lead.

708
00:50:05,754 --> 00:50:08,252
There were two derelicts
seen in the area.

709
00:50:08,352 --> 00:50:13,182
I have their description.
I sent them over to your office, copies.

710
00:50:13,282 --> 00:50:15,980
Right.
Uh, I'll have that checked out.

711
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,912
Anything new on your end?

712
00:50:18,212 --> 00:50:22,209
Uh, oh, yeah.
Yeah, we got a couple of things.

713
00:50:23,175 --> 00:50:26,772
It seems as though Mrs. Kennicut
was having an affair, you see?

714
00:50:27,605 --> 00:50:28,871
Uh...

715
00:50:30,969 --> 00:50:34,434
Boy, this is delicious.
How do you make this stuff?

716
00:50:35,299 --> 00:50:39,763
I'll have a recipe sent over to you.
You were saying?

717
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:44,260
Oh, yeah. Uh, it seems as though
Mrs. Kennicut, uh,

718
00:50:44,693 --> 00:50:46,825
she was having an affair.

719
00:50:46,924 --> 00:50:49,223
- And, uh...
- Oh?

720
00:50:49,456 --> 00:50:50,522
And, uh...

721
00:50:50,622 --> 00:50:52,587
Oh, listen, when you send the recipe,
would you send it to the house?

722
00:50:52,688 --> 00:50:54,019
Don't send it to the office.

723
00:50:54,986 --> 00:50:56,817
Yes, I'll send it to your house.

724
00:50:57,184 --> 00:51:00,682
Yeah, she was having an affair
with some golf pro at some country club.

725
00:51:00,782 --> 00:51:03,579
And, uh, here's
the interesting thing.

726
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,378
Not only were they having an affair,

727
00:51:05,744 --> 00:51:08,542
but it seems as though
they were being watched.

728
00:51:08,642 --> 00:51:11,007
Now I got this nutty notion.

729
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,738
Suppose Mr. Kennicut, uh...

730
00:51:15,437 --> 00:51:18,269
I'll tell you, it's too far-fetched.

731
00:51:18,368 --> 00:51:20,833
Sometimes it helps to test it out.
Try me.

732
00:51:20,933 --> 00:51:25,797
It's really crazy. Well, listen.
It doesn't cost anything.

733
00:51:25,897 --> 00:51:29,028
Suppose... Suppose Mr. Kennicut...

734
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:31,726
hired somebody
to check up on his wife.

735
00:51:31,825 --> 00:51:34,790
And this somebody lied to him.

736
00:51:36,056 --> 00:51:37,222
He said to Mr. Kennicut,

737
00:51:37,322 --> 00:51:41,052
"Look. Your wife, she's got
a clean bill of health."

738
00:51:42,052 --> 00:51:44,283
Now this somebody,
whoever it is,

739
00:51:44,549 --> 00:51:47,781
he's in a perfect position
to blackmail Mrs. Kennicut.

740
00:51:47,881 --> 00:51:50,346
Now suppose she refuses.

741
00:51:50,512 --> 00:51:54,276
See? She says,
"No, I'm gonna go tell my husband."

742
00:51:56,142 --> 00:51:59,073
I think it's a terrific motive,
don't you?

743
00:51:59,606 --> 00:52:02,970
Lieutenant, you have
a marvelously convoluted mind.

744
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,068
- I do?
- I like it.

745
00:52:05,835 --> 00:52:09,499
The trouble with your theory is,
not only is it very tenuous,

746
00:52:10,065 --> 00:52:13,296
but it's impossible to prove,
isn't it?

747
00:52:14,196 --> 00:52:18,826
I, uh... Oh.
Got a little tomato on that there.

748
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:21,390
Well, I said it was nutty.

749
00:52:21,557 --> 00:52:24,488
What do you think?
You think I oughta drop it, hmm?

750
00:52:24,687 --> 00:52:28,352
If you believe in it, stick to it.
Run it on down.

751
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:32,282
One other thing
you should keep in mind.

752
00:52:33,448 --> 00:52:35,014
Nothing at all to do with the case.

753
00:52:36,113 --> 00:52:36,779
What's that?

754
00:52:37,812 --> 00:52:38,578
Your future.

755
00:52:40,509 --> 00:52:43,307
I'd like you to work
for Brimmer Associates.

756
00:52:44,673 --> 00:52:45,340
Me?

757
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,339
That's why I had you taken on...

758
00:52:46,439 --> 00:52:49,604
a V.I.P. tour. We're a growing
organization. You can see that.

759
00:52:49,803 --> 00:52:51,668
You'll be a valuable piece
of manpower for us.

760
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:56,165
Oh, boy. You really know
how to toss a curve.

761
00:52:56,265 --> 00:52:58,763
No, no, I don't mean it that way.
I'm quite serious.

762
00:52:59,862 --> 00:53:02,227
You're a good man, Columbo...
up here.

763
00:53:03,027 --> 00:53:05,059
It's time you were thinking
about advancement.

764
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:06,791
What does a lieutenant make?

765
00:53:07,457 --> 00:53:08,922
If you come with us,

766
00:53:09,356 --> 00:53:12,587
I'm almost positive
I can triple your yearly income.

767
00:53:12,687 --> 00:53:16,884
Whew! Boy.
I'll tell you, it's all so sudden.

768
00:53:16,984 --> 00:53:21,048
Uh, let me talk it over with my wife.

769
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,779
Of course talk it over with your wife.
Think about it carefully.

770
00:53:24,111 --> 00:53:26,144
But remember, we want you here.

771
00:53:26,577 --> 00:53:30,007
Listen. I'm very flattered.
I mean that.

772
00:53:30,107 --> 00:53:31,806
Just let me mull it over a little bit.

773
00:53:31,906 --> 00:53:33,572
Well, while you're mulling,

774
00:53:34,405 --> 00:53:37,303
consider my career.

775
00:53:38,135 --> 00:53:39,800
If I'd stayed with the force,

776
00:53:41,699 --> 00:53:43,731
by now, probably with luck,

777
00:53:44,031 --> 00:53:46,828
I could have been
a captain of detectives.

778
00:53:47,428 --> 00:53:51,259
With one eye on the promotion list,
and the other eye on my car payments.

779
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:52,558
No house by the ocean.

780
00:53:52,858 --> 00:53:54,889
No freedom to travel.
No... what would you say?

781
00:53:54,989 --> 00:53:58,354
Power or sense of accomplishment.

782
00:54:03,616 --> 00:54:05,948
Have I succeeded
in getting through...

783
00:54:07,548 --> 00:54:08,680
in stimulating you?

784
00:54:09,146 --> 00:54:11,078
Definitely. Yes, sir.

785
00:54:11,478 --> 00:54:13,543
Yes, I'm gonna give it all
a lot of thought.

786
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:15,874
That's as much as I can ask.

787
00:54:16,908 --> 00:54:19,505
- Uh, one thing.
- Hmm?

788
00:54:19,672 --> 00:54:24,068
If I came with you, would I still
be working on the Kennicut case?

789
00:54:25,934 --> 00:54:27,300
Well, let's see.

790
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:32,896
I have men who are perfectly capable
of handling the Kennicut case. No.

791
00:54:33,462 --> 00:54:35,261
I have several other matters
that are far more important than that,

792
00:54:35,361 --> 00:54:37,260
I'd like to put you on right away.

793
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:44,255
Lieutenant,
to the knock of opportunity.

794
00:54:59,576 --> 00:55:01,142
- Hey.
- Hi.

795
00:55:01,242 --> 00:55:03,474
Dry throat for some reason.

796
00:55:03,573 --> 00:55:04,772
Oh, help yourself.

797
00:55:04,873 --> 00:55:07,971
Yeah. Hey, I hope I didn't
get you into trouble before.

798
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:09,436
I mean, I'm sorry
about what happened.

799
00:55:09,536 --> 00:55:10,902
I'm used to it.

800
00:55:11,602 --> 00:55:13,466
Why? Does he blow off
a lot of steam?

801
00:55:13,566 --> 00:55:16,764
Well, let's just say our
founding father has quite a temper.

802
00:55:16,865 --> 00:55:18,696
No kidding.
That's funny, because he...

803
00:55:18,796 --> 00:55:21,528
he looks to me like he's a guy
that's always under control.

804
00:55:21,627 --> 00:55:24,125
Uh, correction.
He's under control most of the time.

805
00:55:24,226 --> 00:55:27,656
And when people like that let go,
stand back.

806
00:55:27,756 --> 00:55:30,987
I'll tell you why I'm interested.
He offered me a job.

807
00:55:31,087 --> 00:55:32,453
- Oh?
- Yeah.

808
00:55:32,919 --> 00:55:35,951
- Well, welcome to the family.
- Yeah, here's my problem.

809
00:55:36,317 --> 00:55:37,749
I don't know how much to ask for.

810
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:41,314
Whatever you can get.
Top man can pull down about 30,000.

811
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:44,245
No kidding?
That's a lot of money.

812
00:55:44,344 --> 00:55:46,676
Gee, listen. Does anybody else here
make more than that?

813
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:48,142
I mean, besides Mr. Brimmer?

814
00:55:48,808 --> 00:55:51,773
Well, maybe Leo.

815
00:55:51,872 --> 00:55:53,637
- Who's Leo?
- Leo Gentry.

816
00:55:53,737 --> 00:55:55,204
He's the boy
who gets the cream of the cases.

817
00:55:55,304 --> 00:55:56,802
Hey, I think I know him.

818
00:55:57,168 --> 00:55:58,900
Crew cut, ex-marine type?

819
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,533
Yeah, that's Leo.

820
00:56:01,432 --> 00:56:03,398
Teacher's pet, at least this month.

821
00:56:03,497 --> 00:56:07,994
Hey, listen. Where can I talk to him?
Maybe he can give me a few pointers.

822
00:56:09,093 --> 00:56:11,925
Oh. I haven't seen him
around yet today, but, uh...

823
00:56:13,057 --> 00:56:16,688
I'll get his address from Personnel.
Uh, don't mention it to Brimmer.

824
00:56:16,788 --> 00:56:19,419
Who me? No.
That's the last thing I'd do.

825
00:56:29,912 --> 00:56:30,578
Higher.

826
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:32,876
Higher? Listen.
If you go any higher,

827
00:56:32,976 --> 00:56:34,775
you're gonna go right over the top.

828
00:56:37,239 --> 00:56:38,705
Hey, what's going on?

829
00:56:38,806 --> 00:56:41,637
Mrs. Gentry? I wanna tell you,
you got a terrific kid here.

830
00:56:41,737 --> 00:56:45,201
Nothing frightens him.
You can't scare this boy.

831
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,800
I said higher!

832
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,166
Higher? All right, listen.

833
00:56:48,266 --> 00:56:50,397
You go higher, and I'll eat
your ice cream, all right?

834
00:56:50,497 --> 00:56:51,563
No, I wanna eat it.

835
00:56:51,663 --> 00:56:54,994
You wanna eat it. All right.
Here you go. You're coming down.

836
00:56:55,094 --> 00:56:57,691
Down to earth. There you are.
Get your ice cream.

837
00:56:58,191 --> 00:56:59,224
Do we know each other?

838
00:56:59,324 --> 00:57:02,055
Uh, no. Uh, my name is Columbo.

839
00:57:02,156 --> 00:57:04,320
I'm a lieutenant.
I'm from the police.

840
00:57:07,218 --> 00:57:08,784
My daddy's a private eye.

841
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:11,982
I know that, Teddy.
And he's a very good one.

842
00:57:12,082 --> 00:57:13,946
Listen. Do you mind
if I ask you a few questions?

843
00:57:14,213 --> 00:57:15,745
Well, is it about Leo's work?

844
00:57:15,912 --> 00:57:18,710
Well, not exactly. I'm working
on a case, and I thought maybe...

845
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,908
he could help me out.
But I can't seem to locate him.

846
00:57:21,008 --> 00:57:21,875
He went away.

847
00:57:21,975 --> 00:57:24,240
That's right, Lieutenant.
His boss called last night...

848
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,471
and sent him
on a special assignment.

849
00:57:26,737 --> 00:57:29,869
Oh, I see.
Uh, do you know where he went?

850
00:57:29,969 --> 00:57:32,533
Or, uh, how long
he's gonna be away?

851
00:57:32,633 --> 00:57:35,564
Sorry. That's the way
it is with Leo.

852
00:57:35,798 --> 00:57:38,995
He took his passport,
so I guess he's overseas somewhere.

853
00:57:39,262 --> 00:57:41,061
I see.

854
00:57:41,161 --> 00:57:42,093
Is there something wrong?

855
00:57:42,193 --> 00:57:46,057
No, no, no. No, not really.
Listen. Maybe you could help me out.

856
00:57:46,157 --> 00:57:49,055
Was Leo recently on a case
where he was following a woman?

857
00:57:49,155 --> 00:57:50,787
A married woman?

858
00:57:51,121 --> 00:57:53,785
Well, it's... it's possible,
but I don't really know.

859
00:57:54,684 --> 00:57:57,782
No? You never discuss Leo's work?

860
00:57:58,482 --> 00:58:00,947
No. It's a household rule.

861
00:58:01,046 --> 00:58:02,845
I mean, I'm not very much
at keeping secrets.

862
00:58:02,945 --> 00:58:06,043
If Leo were to tell me anything,
it'd be all over the Laundromat.

863
00:58:06,476 --> 00:58:08,707
If you have any questions,
you better ask Leo.

864
00:58:08,807 --> 00:58:11,772
It's kinda hard to ask him,
because I can't locate him.

865
00:58:11,872 --> 00:58:13,304
He went away.

866
00:58:13,671 --> 00:58:16,502
But why don't you talk
to his boss, Mr. Brimmer?

867
00:58:16,602 --> 00:58:18,567
He can tell you
what Leo's working on.

868
00:58:19,133 --> 00:58:22,797
Uh, oh, yeah. I, uh... Thanks.

869
00:58:22,897 --> 00:58:25,196
I have the feeling
he won't be too much help.

870
00:58:25,296 --> 00:58:29,193
But, uh, at any rate,
uh, I'm sorry I bothered you.

871
00:58:29,559 --> 00:58:30,991
Bye-bye, Teddy.

872
00:58:40,651 --> 00:58:45,548
F-E-L-O-P...

873
00:58:45,715 --> 00:58:47,946
Z-D.

874
00:58:48,612 --> 00:58:50,677
All right. Now try
the next to the bottom line.

875
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:55,574
F-D-P...

876
00:58:55,674 --> 00:59:01,703
T-C-E-O?

877
00:59:01,803 --> 00:59:03,269
Perfect vision.

878
00:59:03,768 --> 00:59:05,334
Well, it should be.
This is a new prescription.

879
00:59:05,434 --> 00:59:07,665
Here's your temporary. You should
have your license in a few weeks.

880
00:59:07,765 --> 00:59:10,097
- Thank you very much.
- Keep this too.

881
00:59:10,197 --> 00:59:11,163
Next.

882
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:17,092
Now, while I mark your test,

883
00:59:17,192 --> 00:59:18,490
please read from the eye chart,
third line down.

884
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:21,089
Did that lady say that
she just got a new pair of glasses?

885
00:59:21,555 --> 00:59:22,221
What?

886
00:59:23,421 --> 00:59:25,086
She wasn't wearing glasses.

887
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:26,218
Of course she was.

888
00:59:26,419 --> 00:59:28,983
- Excuse me.
- Uh, wait. What about the eye chart?

889
00:59:31,248 --> 00:59:33,314
And all of a sudden,
I remembered this picture.

890
00:59:33,414 --> 00:59:35,112
See? She's wearing glasses.

891
00:59:35,312 --> 00:59:37,544
But there were no glasses
on the body.

892
00:59:37,643 --> 00:59:39,942
Now, could she have
dropped them somewhere?

893
00:59:41,141 --> 00:59:43,073
I'm sorry, Lieutenant,
but you're on the wrong track.

894
00:59:43,173 --> 00:59:44,239
Why?

895
00:59:44,339 --> 00:59:46,138
Well, shortly after
that picture was taken,

896
00:59:46,238 --> 00:59:49,635
Lenore gave up wearing glasses.
She switched to contact lenses.

897
00:59:49,735 --> 00:59:52,233
Ah, contact lenses.

898
00:59:52,333 --> 00:59:55,398
Just a matter of vanity.
She thought she looked better.

899
00:59:55,498 --> 00:59:58,062
Uh-huh.
Did she wear 'em often?

900
00:59:58,162 --> 01:00:02,659
All the time.
She was extremely nearsighted.

901
01:00:03,126 --> 01:00:05,757
Mr. Kennicut, where's your wife's
personal effects?

902
01:00:09,554 --> 01:00:11,519
The funeral director
sent them over.

903
01:00:14,051 --> 01:00:15,950
I've avoided
going through them.

904
01:00:16,483 --> 01:00:18,181
- Do you mind?
- No, go ahead.

905
01:00:35,169 --> 01:00:36,735
This her lens case?

906
01:00:37,368 --> 01:00:38,667
Yes.

907
01:00:41,164 --> 01:00:42,164
It's empty.

908
01:00:42,697 --> 01:00:45,328
Well, she was probably
wearing them when she died.

909
01:00:48,726 --> 01:00:50,391
Well, then maybe, uh...

910
01:00:50,491 --> 01:00:51,924
Maybe what?

911
01:00:53,955 --> 01:00:56,721
Mr. Kennicut, I'm gonna ask your
permission for something.

912
01:00:56,820 --> 01:01:01,017
This is the world's biggest long shot.
And it's gonna be painful for you.

913
01:01:01,217 --> 01:01:03,149
But I think it's worth a try.

914
01:01:03,781 --> 01:01:05,114
Would it help?

915
01:01:05,314 --> 01:01:07,013
There are no guarantees.

916
01:01:09,744 --> 01:01:12,842
All right, Lieutenant.
You have a blank check.

917
01:01:30,529 --> 01:01:35,226
Mobile Operator,
the number I want is 476-7301.

918
01:01:37,391 --> 01:01:39,456
They just arrived,
and they're entering the vault.

919
01:01:39,556 --> 01:01:40,922
<i>The medical examiner's with them.</i>

920
01:01:41,021 --> 01:01:42,454
Why? What's the reason?

921
01:01:42,554 --> 01:01:45,452
Haven't been able to find out, sir,
but I did learn one thing.

922
01:01:45,552 --> 01:01:47,251
Kennicut signed
an exhumation order.

923
01:01:47,584 --> 01:01:49,683
All right, stay there.
I'll be right over.

924
01:01:54,445 --> 01:01:55,644
Get my car ready.

925
01:02:00,774 --> 01:02:02,473
He says it won't take long.

926
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,300
What's the trouble?

927
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:13,532
I don't know, sir.

928
01:02:13,631 --> 01:02:16,263
The battery's okay,
but the car won't start.

929
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:21,326
I'm in a hurry.
Get me another car.

930
01:02:21,426 --> 01:02:22,458
Yes, sir.

931
01:02:26,522 --> 01:02:29,054
Have this one serviced.
Tell them I want it tomorrow.

932
01:02:29,154 --> 01:02:29,920
Yes, sir.

933
01:02:50,405 --> 01:02:51,305
Arthur.

934
01:02:51,404 --> 01:02:53,769
I should have phoned you,
but there wasn't time.

935
01:02:53,869 --> 01:02:56,867
Well, it's all right.
One of my men told me you were here.

936
01:02:57,034 --> 01:02:57,933
Something break?

937
01:02:58,033 --> 01:03:01,064
I don't know yet.
They're exhuming Lenore's body.

938
01:03:09,791 --> 01:03:10,924
Tell me why.

939
01:03:11,457 --> 01:03:14,022
Well, the lieutenant's
working on a long shot.

940
01:03:14,121 --> 01:03:17,852
Apparently, she was wearing
her contact lenses when she was killed.

941
01:03:19,085 --> 01:03:20,550
How's that significant?

942
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:24,114
Well, there's a chance that
she might have lost one of them,

943
01:03:24,214 --> 01:03:26,846
maybe both of them
at the scene of the crime.

944
01:03:29,744 --> 01:03:33,041
Well, Arthur,
I don't like to be critical,

945
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:35,206
but that's more than a long shot.

946
01:03:35,939 --> 01:03:38,138
You might as well buy
a lottery ticket.

947
01:03:38,238 --> 01:03:41,869
Maybe not. Listen to me.
My nephew wears those things,

948
01:03:41,969 --> 01:03:43,967
and half of the time
they're falling out.

949
01:03:44,067 --> 01:03:47,065
Now, the other morning at breakfast,
one of them ended up in the cereal.

950
01:03:47,431 --> 01:03:50,096
Mrs. Kennicut is not
your nephew, Lieutenant.

951
01:03:50,195 --> 01:03:55,126
Listen. Mrs. Kennicut was struck
forcibly. Now let's bear that in mind.

952
01:03:55,226 --> 01:03:57,491
Why isn't it possible
that they were knocked loose?

953
01:03:57,591 --> 01:03:59,289
Anything's possible.

954
01:03:59,589 --> 01:04:02,787
The autopsy report said
nothing about any of this at all.

955
01:04:02,887 --> 01:04:04,619
Listen. Forget about
the autopsy report.

956
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:06,750
I checked with the medical
examiner about that.

957
01:04:06,851 --> 01:04:09,715
They snuffed it off.
They didn't even bother to look.

958
01:04:09,815 --> 01:04:12,047
All they were concerned about
was the cause of death.

959
01:04:12,147 --> 01:04:13,479
Lieutenant.

960
01:04:21,973 --> 01:04:23,371
Well, I hope it's not a waste.

961
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:29,401
What else can I do?
I've got to pursue every possibility.

962
01:04:29,501 --> 01:04:32,632
Arthur, it's almost
a criminal breach...

963
01:04:33,065 --> 01:04:36,529
to disappoint you now
after what you've been through.

964
01:04:47,655 --> 01:04:48,787
Move over.

965
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,051
Listen. We're in luck.

966
01:04:52,151 --> 01:04:55,116
The right contact lens is missing,
and it's not in the coffin.

967
01:04:55,216 --> 01:04:58,081
Well, it might have fallen out
in the morgue, I guess.

968
01:04:58,181 --> 01:05:00,611
Or in the ambulance. Or in the street.

969
01:05:00,711 --> 01:05:03,576
She might have lost it
before she was killed.

970
01:05:04,176 --> 01:05:05,809
Could be a hundred places.

971
01:05:05,908 --> 01:05:08,339
That's true, but maybe...

972
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,671
and this is what we gotta hope for...

973
01:05:10,771 --> 01:05:12,637
maybe it's at the place
where she was murdered.

974
01:05:13,136 --> 01:05:14,968
But we don't know
where that place is.

975
01:05:15,069 --> 01:05:17,699
No, sir, we don't.
We don't know for sure.

976
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,898
But I've got a few hunches.

977
01:05:20,131 --> 01:05:22,129
Unless you can be specific,
I can't help.

978
01:05:22,229 --> 01:05:24,694
I think the lieutenant
deserves some room. Don't you?

979
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:26,260
As you wish.

980
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:27,958
You go your own way, Lieutenant.

981
01:05:28,059 --> 01:05:29,124
Thank you, sir. I will.

982
01:05:29,224 --> 01:05:30,258
Keep us posted.

983
01:05:30,357 --> 01:05:32,955
Yes, sir. I will.
I'll keep you posted.

984
01:05:39,784 --> 01:05:41,749
I only wish one thing.

985
01:05:42,382 --> 01:05:44,447
I wish the murderer knew about this.

986
01:05:44,547 --> 01:05:45,380
Why?

987
01:05:45,479 --> 01:05:47,378
There'd be a piece of
conclusive evidence...

988
01:05:47,478 --> 01:05:49,543
that might be lying around
in his premises,

989
01:05:49,643 --> 01:05:52,075
and he'd have to find it
before we did.

990
01:05:52,342 --> 01:05:54,173
I'll keep you posted, sir.

991
01:06:29,482 --> 01:06:30,148
Lieutenant.

992
01:06:30,247 --> 01:06:32,712
Mr. Brimmer. Listen. I'm sorry
to bother you at this hour,

993
01:06:32,812 --> 01:06:34,511
but, uh... May I come in?

994
01:06:34,611 --> 01:06:35,977
Yes, sure. Come on in.

995
01:06:36,076 --> 01:06:38,075
There's something
I wanted to talk to you about.

996
01:06:38,175 --> 01:06:41,406
Okay. Fine, if you can make it
a little brief. It's been a late day.

997
01:06:41,506 --> 01:06:46,136
Oh, sure. Say, this is
some terrific place you got here.

998
01:06:46,236 --> 01:06:48,701
And you got the sound
of the ocean all the time, huh?

999
01:06:48,801 --> 01:06:51,165
Well, me, I love the beach. I love it.

1000
01:06:51,265 --> 01:06:53,864
Except when the water gets cold,
then I don't like to go in.

1001
01:06:53,964 --> 01:06:54,930
Then I like a pool.

1002
01:06:55,030 --> 01:06:56,695
Did you say you had
something on your mind?

1003
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:02,591
Oh, yeah.
It's about that job you offered me.

1004
01:07:03,091 --> 01:07:05,289
I've been giving it a lot of thought.

1005
01:07:05,389 --> 01:07:08,387
As a matter of fact,
uh, I haven't been able to sleep.

1006
01:07:08,487 --> 01:07:10,052
And, uh...

1007
01:07:12,651 --> 01:07:17,380
Boy, this is a fantastic rug.
My wife would love this rug.

1008
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:21,244
We gotta get a new rug,
and this is just the kind she wants.

1009
01:07:21,577 --> 01:07:25,375
Fantastic piling, huh?
Very soft.

1010
01:07:25,641 --> 01:07:27,306
Bet you could lose a shoe in here
for a week, you wouldn't find it.

1011
01:07:27,406 --> 01:07:31,171
It's late. I still got a lot of work to
do. You were talking about my job offer.

1012
01:07:32,403 --> 01:07:35,901
I really don't think I'd be very happy
making a change, you know.

1013
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,665
I like it where I am.
It's not a bad life.

1014
01:07:38,765 --> 01:07:42,362
Mm-hmm. Okay.
Uh, is that final?

1015
01:07:42,462 --> 01:07:46,126
I think so, yes. No hard feelings?

1016
01:07:46,226 --> 01:07:48,824
No, no, certainly not.
I just, uh...

1017
01:07:48,924 --> 01:07:51,122
Well, I think you're
making a mistake. That's all.

1018
01:07:51,222 --> 01:07:53,255
You're probably right.
You know, my wife,

1019
01:07:53,355 --> 01:07:55,953
she's always said
I don't have enough ambition.

1020
01:07:56,419 --> 01:07:59,950
You know what it was
that really made up my mind?

1021
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:01,382
What was that?

1022
01:08:01,482 --> 01:08:03,380
The Kennicut case.

1023
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,613
I don't wanna give up
working on it just now.

1024
01:08:05,712 --> 01:08:08,311
Not when I'm so close
to a solution.

1025
01:08:08,743 --> 01:08:12,174
Well, uh, are you gonna
let me in on it?

1026
01:08:12,274 --> 01:08:14,606
Oh, certainly. Don't worry.

1027
01:08:14,706 --> 01:08:17,304
You'll be the first to know.
Good night.

1028
01:08:19,702 --> 01:08:20,735
Good night.

1029
01:08:59,741 --> 01:09:00,406
Hello?

1030
01:09:00,506 --> 01:09:02,505
Yes, this is Mr. Brimmer.

1031
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:04,970
You took my car in
to be repaired, didn't you?

1032
01:09:05,103 --> 01:09:06,968
Yes, sir. Just like you said.

1033
01:09:07,068 --> 01:09:08,834
They'll try to have it for you
as soon as they can.

1034
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:10,799
All right then. Good night.

1035
01:11:18,374 --> 01:11:20,639
You mind telling us
what you're doing?

1036
01:11:21,505 --> 01:11:24,004
I'd say that was none of
your business, Lieutenant.

1037
01:11:24,103 --> 01:11:26,102
Well, if you say so, but, uh,

1038
01:11:26,202 --> 01:11:28,500
it's gonna be kinda hard to
explain, isn't it? I mean,

1039
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:30,665
breaking and entering?
That's against the law.

1040
01:11:30,765 --> 01:11:33,496
Checking the trunk of your car. What
in the world were you looking for?

1041
01:11:34,429 --> 01:11:37,560
Papers... for a case.

1042
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:39,792
I thought they were here.
It's an emergency.

1043
01:11:39,892 --> 01:11:41,224
Why don't you admit it?

1044
01:11:41,324 --> 01:11:43,855
You were searching the trunk,
'cause that's where you hid the body.

1045
01:11:45,721 --> 01:11:47,887
All right. What's the next step?

1046
01:11:47,986 --> 01:11:49,418
Why don't we go downtown
and talk it over?

1047
01:11:49,519 --> 01:11:50,950
Am I under arrest?

1048
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:53,449
- I guess you could say so.
- On what evidence?

1049
01:11:53,549 --> 01:11:55,448
I think it's gotta be
more comfortable downtown.

1050
01:11:55,547 --> 01:11:58,812
All right.
Let's get this farce over with.

1051
01:12:04,807 --> 01:12:06,240
Grab his arm!

1052
01:12:21,662 --> 01:12:23,527
It was an accident, Arthur.

1053
01:12:25,226 --> 01:12:29,856
It wasn't... premeditated.

1054
01:12:30,356 --> 01:12:32,454
I hardly knew your wife.

1055
01:12:34,153 --> 01:12:35,852
I didn't want to hurt
either one of you.

1056
01:12:48,943 --> 01:12:49,975
It happened.

1057
01:12:56,803 --> 01:12:58,169
How'd you get it?

1058
01:12:59,534 --> 01:13:02,799
I got it from the cut on her cheek
and your ring.

1059
01:13:03,566 --> 01:13:05,831
You never should have
let me read your palm.

1060
01:13:06,763 --> 01:13:08,961
'Cause then I felt the ring
and I felt the two diamonds...

1061
01:13:09,061 --> 01:13:11,859
sticking out and that raised
rectangular border.

1062
01:13:12,392 --> 01:13:14,990
That matched up
with the cut on her cheek.

1063
01:13:16,456 --> 01:13:19,188
You should have taken that job.

1064
01:13:35,543 --> 01:13:38,007
You know,
we're lucky Lenore lost this.

1065
01:13:38,474 --> 01:13:39,906
Uh, she didn't lose it.

1066
01:13:40,639 --> 01:13:41,538
What?

1067
01:13:41,838 --> 01:13:44,803
When I spoke to the medical examiner
at the cemetery,

1068
01:13:44,968 --> 01:13:48,233
he told me that both contact lenses
were on the body.

1069
01:13:49,266 --> 01:13:52,130
But that's impossible.
If it isn't hers, whose was it?

1070
01:13:52,230 --> 01:13:55,394
Who knows? Anyway,
it doesn't make any difference.

1071
01:13:55,494 --> 01:13:58,526
The fact that it's not the real
contact lens, that doesn't count.

1072
01:13:58,626 --> 01:14:01,091
What does count
is Mr. Brimmer's actions,

1073
01:14:01,190 --> 01:14:04,188
coming here tonight,
trying to get rid of that thing...

1074
01:14:04,288 --> 01:14:06,520
and doing it all
in front of witnesses.

1075
01:14:08,519 --> 01:14:10,950
What would you have done
if the car hadn't broken down?

1076
01:14:11,051 --> 01:14:12,882
You couldn't set up this trap.

1077
01:14:13,515 --> 01:14:18,211
Well, I guess we would have
found some other way.

1078
01:14:18,778 --> 01:14:21,009
You know what this place
reminds me of?

1079
01:14:23,341 --> 01:14:25,773
Just seeing all these cars,

1080
01:14:25,873 --> 01:14:28,371
you know, in our neighborhood,
we had a bunch of jokers.

1081
01:14:28,471 --> 01:14:30,969
I mean, we were
a real wild bunch of guys.

1082
01:14:31,069 --> 01:14:34,334
And we figured out a perfect way
to put a car out of commission.

1083
01:14:34,433 --> 01:14:37,431
You take a potato,
you stick it in the exhaust pipe.

1084
01:14:38,231 --> 01:14:41,728
It doesn't cause any damage,
but the car won't start.

1085
01:14:41,895 --> 01:14:45,525
It was a terrible thing to do.
And I got a feeling...

1086
01:14:46,458 --> 01:14:48,024
that the reason I became a cop
was to...

1087
01:14:48,124 --> 01:14:51,055
make up for all those jokes
I played when I was a kid.
