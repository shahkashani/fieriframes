1
00:00:03,168 --> 00:00:04,327
I need 80 cents.

2
00:00:04,328 --> 00:00:06,734
No, you don't. You need to put
back two of those extra candy bars

3
00:00:06,735 --> 00:00:08,101
that you just picked up.

4
00:00:08,102 --> 00:00:09,730
Dad, you don't
understand.

5
00:00:09,731 --> 00:00:11,570
I can't put back
one of these.

6
00:00:11,571 --> 00:00:14,839
That would be like saying one of these
candy bars is less worthy than the others.

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,641
And I can't play
those kinds of favorites.

8
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:18,045
All right, fine.
Enjoy your dilemma.

9
00:00:18,046 --> 00:00:20,141
In the meantime,
don't drag Gus into it.

10
00:00:20,142 --> 00:00:21,344
Thanks, Mr. Spencer.

11
00:00:21,345 --> 00:00:22,579
No problem.

12
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,881
Switch places with me.

13
00:00:23,882 --> 00:00:25,183
No.
Why not?

14
00:00:25,184 --> 00:00:27,622
Because then you'll try to
take whatever money I have left.

15
00:00:27,623 --> 00:00:29,250
And when have I tried
to do that to you?

16
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:30,988
Wednesday and Saturday.

17
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,256
Monday.

18
00:00:32,257 --> 00:00:34,660
Gosh, you guys
have scary memories.

19
00:00:34,661 --> 00:00:36,097
Next in line, please.

20
00:00:36,098 --> 00:00:37,532
That's you.
No.

21
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:39,503
Shawn, come on. That's you.

22
00:00:41,073 --> 00:00:42,836
Okay, so, all of these?

23
00:00:44,398 --> 00:00:46,636
Oh, my gosh!
It happened here?

24
00:00:46,637 --> 00:00:48,178
The one-millionth customer.

25
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:49,235
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:49,236 --> 00:00:50,575
Don't be sorry, kid.
You won!

27
00:00:50,576 --> 00:00:51,910
He won? He won what?

28
00:00:51,911 --> 00:00:56,114
All kinds of things. Gift
certificates, that cool bike up there.

29
00:00:56,355 --> 00:01:00,086
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we have
it! Our one-millionth customer!</i>

30
00:01:00,292 --> 00:01:02,316
Can I use one of my
gift certificates now?

31
00:01:02,317 --> 00:01:03,451
Sure.

32
00:01:03,452 --> 00:01:05,894
Cool!
Isn't it awesome?

33
00:01:05,895 --> 00:01:08,592
Isn't this cool, Gus?
How lucky am I?

34
00:01:10,169 --> 00:01:11,601
Thanks for doing this.

35
00:01:11,602 --> 00:01:13,864
Oh, don't be silly.
Are you kidding?

36
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,270
Go out spur of the moment
with a sexy gal

37
00:01:16,271 --> 00:01:18,832
who likes quirky dive bars
as a starting point

38
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:23,172
But then is also open to seeing
where the night goes, you know?

39
00:01:23,173 --> 00:01:25,909
You could've thought
I was weird asking you out

40
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,712
because you walked
by my counter.

41
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:28,843
I don't call that weird.

42
00:01:28,844 --> 00:01:32,948
I call that blind, dumb,
stupid, awe-inspired luck.

43
00:01:36,562 --> 00:01:38,052
I'm gonna get drinks.

44
00:01:39,298 --> 00:01:40,993
Two vodka sodas.

45
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:45,695
I've just decided I am
going to experience life.

46
00:01:45,696 --> 00:01:47,499
You know, try new things.

47
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,472
I signed up for
a painting class today.

48
00:01:49,473 --> 00:01:51,940
You know, they make the kind
of paint you can eat now.

49
00:01:51,941 --> 00:01:55,537
And I'm giving
new focus to my job.

50
00:01:58,217 --> 00:01:59,240
So...

51
00:01:59,241 --> 00:02:00,375
Can I ask you a question?

52
00:02:00,376 --> 00:02:01,611
Anything.

53
00:02:01,612 --> 00:02:04,120
Did you just get out
of a relationship?

54
00:02:04,121 --> 00:02:05,280
How did you know?

55
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,721
Just a wild guess.

56
00:02:06,722 --> 00:02:08,282
Was it

57
00:02:09,361 --> 00:02:10,487
today?

58
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:12,256
Yesterday.

59
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,264
Are you sure you should
be out dating already?

60
00:02:14,265 --> 00:02:16,197
Yes, of course.

61
00:02:16,198 --> 00:02:19,065
He was cheating on me.

62
00:02:19,404 --> 00:02:20,734
Cheating?
Yeah.

63
00:02:20,735 --> 00:02:24,673
And the stupid thing is I thought
everything was going really well, you know?

64
00:02:24,674 --> 00:02:27,644
And then he just started getting
all weird the last month.

65
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,470
Lying, going
through my stuff,

66
00:02:30,471 --> 00:02:32,548
my address book, my jewelry.

67
00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:36,951
Finally, Friday he tells me he's
going to watch the game at a friend's.

68
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:39,850
A co-worker of mine spots him
over at the Eastland center.

69
00:02:39,851 --> 00:02:43,520
He may not accept it yet, but
we are definitely finished.

70
00:02:44,863 --> 00:02:47,126
Thank you. I hope you
don't mind being a rebound.

71
00:02:47,127 --> 00:02:49,190
Oh, I usually prefer it.

72
00:02:51,303 --> 00:02:52,860
But not in this case.

73
00:02:52,861 --> 00:02:53,995
Why not?

74
00:02:54,406 --> 00:02:56,601
Primarily because
he's not cheating on you.

75
00:02:59,311 --> 00:03:02,336
Look, he took your jewelry because he's
trying to figure out your ring size.

76
00:03:02,337 --> 00:03:05,849
He took you to Tiffany's
to buy that fancy necklace

77
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:09,216
because he's really trying to scout out
what kind of stones and settings you like.

78
00:03:09,217 --> 00:03:10,720
What about last Friday?

79
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:12,278
Oh, come on.
The Eastland center?

80
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:14,722
There's no bars or clubs there.
He wasn't there with a chick.

81
00:03:14,723 --> 00:03:16,157
He was probably in the north
side of the parking lot

82
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:19,061
at Robbins Bros.,
picking out the ring.

83
00:03:19,831 --> 00:03:21,092
My address book?

84
00:03:21,093 --> 00:03:23,759
Called your parents to ask for
your hand. He's doing it right.

85
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,165
Do you think
I should call him?

86
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,501
I'll let you be
a psychic on that one.

87
00:03:31,643 --> 00:03:34,440
Ray? Yeah, I need you
to tell me the truth.

88
00:03:34,441 --> 00:03:38,108
If you lie to me, we will never
speak again, do you understand?

89
00:03:41,086 --> 00:03:42,815
About Friday.
Who were you with?

90
00:03:43,088 --> 00:03:44,180
Take your time.

91
00:03:50,162 --> 00:03:51,356
Lassy?

92
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:55,425
Spencer. Why am I surprised?

93
00:03:56,768 --> 00:03:57,825
Why are you wasted?

94
00:03:57,826 --> 00:04:00,427
Hey, do you
like Scotch? Miss!

95
00:04:00,428 --> 00:04:03,234
Can I get two
more of these, please? Thank you.

96
00:04:03,235 --> 00:04:07,437
Listen, there is something I
have got to get off my chest.

97
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:09,638
Is it your shirt?
Please say no.

98
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,942
You

99
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:14,348
astound me.

100
00:04:16,021 --> 00:04:17,044
Come again?

101
00:04:17,045 --> 00:04:18,110
It's beyond astounding.

102
00:04:18,111 --> 00:04:21,556
It is some of the most impressive
reasoning I've ever seen.

103
00:04:21,557 --> 00:04:23,321
Is there a punch line
coming? Let's get to it.

104
00:04:23,322 --> 00:04:24,656
I don't know how you do it.

105
00:04:24,657 --> 00:04:28,496
I mean, it's not psychic-ness, we
both know that's a crock of crap.

106
00:04:29,334 --> 00:04:31,996
But you, sir, are unstoppable,

107
00:04:32,638 --> 00:04:34,196
guaranteed arrest.

108
00:04:35,507 --> 00:04:37,031
What's happening here?

109
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:38,897
Can I tell you a secret?

110
00:04:38,898 --> 00:04:40,500
I wouldn't recommend it, no.

111
00:04:40,501 --> 00:04:41,943
Listen,

112
00:04:41,944 --> 00:04:45,471
you know how everyone thinks my wife and
I have been separated for nine months?

113
00:04:45,472 --> 00:04:46,982
Yes.

114
00:04:46,983 --> 00:04:49,643
Two years. Two years tonight.

115
00:04:50,022 --> 00:04:52,353
And I'm the one who keeps
trying to fix the thing.

116
00:04:52,354 --> 00:04:54,219
I mean...
Jeez.

117
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,920
...counseling, therapy,
acupuncture, you name it.

118
00:04:57,921 --> 00:05:00,692
I have tried to
try to try it.

119
00:05:02,601 --> 00:05:04,899
Well, I'm gonna
let you go.

120
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:07,197
Don't drive.

121
00:05:07,673 --> 00:05:10,574
You know, I used to be
a good cop. Seriously.

122
00:05:11,243 --> 00:05:13,972
Stunning arrest record. It was
one of the best in the department.

123
00:05:13,973 --> 00:05:15,979
I caught the
Back Bay killer.

124
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,537
Yes, you did.
I remember it well.

125
00:05:17,538 --> 00:05:19,412
Although I had a tip.
The blue sedan.

126
00:05:19,413 --> 00:05:20,473
Yeah.

127
00:05:22,254 --> 00:05:23,448
That was you?

128
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,014
It might have been.
See what I mean?

129
00:05:27,015 --> 00:05:29,525
Come on, you still had to
put it all together, right?

130
00:05:29,526 --> 00:05:31,993
Look, Spencer, the blue sedan
was the key to the whole thing.

131
00:05:31,994 --> 00:05:33,223
It was the murderer's car.

132
00:05:33,224 --> 00:05:34,958
Yeah, but who had to
run the plates?

133
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,001
And all those numbers and letters
could have confused many a cop.

134
00:05:38,002 --> 00:05:40,867
Spencer, stop, okay?
I am done.

135
00:05:40,868 --> 00:05:44,932
Here, I want you to have
these. I don't need them.

136
00:05:45,377 --> 00:05:46,844
I am over.

137
00:05:47,212 --> 00:05:50,044
All right, just stop this.
This is nonsense.

138
00:05:50,045 --> 00:05:51,547
You're not over.

139
00:05:51,548 --> 00:05:54,709
Look, you're a striking
man with strong features,

140
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:58,152
eyes that women want
to do cannonballs into.

141
00:05:58,153 --> 00:06:02,281
You have great posture and
penmanship the likes I've never seen.

142
00:06:02,282 --> 00:06:05,557
No, I have officially
hit rock bottom.

143
00:06:05,558 --> 00:06:07,620
A month ago,
I got this case, right?

144
00:06:07,621 --> 00:06:10,531
<i>A healthy 42- year-old
astronomer dies.</i>

145
00:06:10,532 --> 00:06:12,534
Doesn't drink, doesn't
smoke, spends all day

146
00:06:12,535 --> 00:06:15,868
in an ergonomically-designed
chair, charting the night sky.

147
00:06:15,869 --> 00:06:18,773
Natural causes, that's what
the Coroner comes back with.

148
00:06:18,774 --> 00:06:21,073
Does a full autopsy.
No red flags. Nothing.

149
00:06:21,074 --> 00:06:24,843
I know he was murdered.
I just can't...

150
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:28,851
What? What?
What is this?

151
00:06:28,852 --> 00:06:29,978
...prove it!

152
00:06:30,822 --> 00:06:32,721
The department won't even
let me pursue it.

153
00:06:32,722 --> 00:06:34,815
Come on, you'll
figure it out.

154
00:06:34,816 --> 00:06:38,920
No, I won't. I can't.
And I've accepted that.

155
00:06:39,364 --> 00:06:41,264
All right, look, Lassy...

156
00:06:44,503 --> 00:06:45,697
Carlton,

157
00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:49,634
I believe in you.
I really do.

158
00:06:49,841 --> 00:06:52,401
You just gotta trust
your instincts.

159
00:06:55,747 --> 00:06:57,077
I just got engaged!

160
00:06:57,078 --> 00:07:00,550
Oh, my God! Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you!

161
00:07:02,344 --> 00:07:03,979
I got engaged!

162
00:07:05,248 --> 00:07:08,121
I'll never, ever
see you again. Bye.

163
00:07:09,884 --> 00:07:12,088
Stick with it, Lassy. You...

164
00:07:14,032 --> 00:07:15,795
You can solve this thing.

165
00:07:17,135 --> 00:07:19,160
You're halfway there already.

166
00:07:24,843 --> 00:07:28,437
<i>I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth</i>

167
00:07:28,438 --> 00:07:31,675
<i>I know, you know
They just don't have any proof</i>

168
00:07:31,676 --> 00:07:34,912
<i>Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend</i>

169
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:39,821
<i>Your worst inhibitions tend
to psych you out in the end</i>

170
00:07:45,697 --> 00:07:47,391
- Check this out.
- What?

171
00:07:47,392 --> 00:07:48,955
Hey, Lassy.

172
00:07:48,956 --> 00:07:50,259
What is it, Spencer?

173
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,835
How you doing?
You okay?

174
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:54,869
All right. I'll bite.
What's the joke?

175
00:07:55,073 --> 00:07:57,973
Just want to make sure you
got home all right last night.

176
00:07:57,974 --> 00:07:59,066
From what?

177
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:00,542
From the bar.
What bar?

178
00:08:00,543 --> 00:08:02,273
You were at a bar?
No, I wasn't at a bar.

179
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:03,469
I don't drink.

180
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,605
You don't drink?

181
00:08:04,606 --> 00:08:07,651
Well, okay.
Wine at weddings.

182
00:08:07,652 --> 00:08:09,481
Occasional snifter
of brandy.

183
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:11,444
Maybe a single-malt scotch.

184
00:08:11,445 --> 00:08:12,648
Sounds like drinking to me.

185
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:16,454
Spencer, why don't you stop making up
stories, okay? They're obviously bogus.

186
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:19,121
Okay, so you were not
at Tom Blair's Pub last night?

187
00:08:19,122 --> 00:08:20,924
I don't even know
who Tom Blair is.

188
00:08:20,925 --> 00:08:24,127
Mmm-hmm. And how'd you get that
sweet bruise on your forehead?

189
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:25,492
I had an altercation.

190
00:08:25,493 --> 00:08:26,866
Yes, with a table.

191
00:08:26,867 --> 00:08:27,995
With a suspect.

192
00:08:27,996 --> 00:08:31,269
If we're done, I would really
like to move on with my day.

193
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,640
I get it.

194
00:08:32,978 --> 00:08:34,570
Yesterday was

195
00:08:35,046 --> 00:08:36,478
a tough anniversary for you.

196
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,674
What?

197
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,210
Who've you
been talking to?

198
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:42,781
Nobody.

199
00:08:43,622 --> 00:08:45,590
I'll get out
of your hair.

200
00:08:50,262 --> 00:08:53,253
Okay. We gotta solve
that case.

201
00:08:53,254 --> 00:08:54,319
What case?

202
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,490
The one Lassiter
can't solve.

203
00:08:55,491 --> 00:08:56,863
He's gonna hire us
for a case?

204
00:08:56,864 --> 00:08:58,231
Oh, God, no.
He'd never do that.

205
00:08:58,232 --> 00:09:00,167
So, we won't get paid?
Exactly.

206
00:09:00,168 --> 00:09:01,670
And we're just doing
it for the glory? Nope.

207
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:03,297
We give Lassiter
all the credit.

208
00:09:03,298 --> 00:09:06,172
In fact, I don't even think
he can know we're helping him.

209
00:09:06,173 --> 00:09:08,575
Dude, that's
a good idea, Shawn.

210
00:09:08,576 --> 00:09:10,909
I ditch out of work on the day
we release three new products

211
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,983
to spend time
on an unsolvable case

212
00:09:12,984 --> 00:09:15,484
in which we won't get paid and
someone else gets all the credit.

213
00:09:15,485 --> 00:09:18,249
That, quite honestly, is some of the
best nut-shelling I've ever heard.

214
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,983
We made a deal.
Yesterday.

215
00:09:19,984 --> 00:09:22,651
We're equal partners. That
means we collectively decide

216
00:09:22,652 --> 00:09:24,751
which appointments to make,
which cases to take.

217
00:09:24,752 --> 00:09:27,160
We have to live by that, at least
for a day, especially today.

218
00:09:27,161 --> 00:09:28,425
You're right.
Thank you.

219
00:09:28,426 --> 00:09:30,160
It's gonna be a
problem, though. Why?

220
00:09:30,161 --> 00:09:31,997
'Cause we've already got a
meeting with the dead guy's widow.

221
00:09:31,998 --> 00:09:33,093
When?
Ten minutes.

222
00:09:33,094 --> 00:09:34,262
Ten minutes?
Look, don't worry.

223
00:09:34,263 --> 00:09:35,805
I'm gonna do it
in the Chief's office.

224
00:09:35,806 --> 00:09:38,671
Just need you to stand guard at the door,
make sure no one catches us in there.

225
00:09:38,672 --> 00:09:41,176
It's gonna double the
excitement. Maybe triple it.

226
00:09:41,177 --> 00:09:43,304
Now, come on, who's in?

227
00:09:43,305 --> 00:09:44,369
Don't fool around.

228
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,439
You know I can't hold my
hand like this for very long.

229
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,385
Gus, I get very poor circulation
to the limbic regions.

230
00:09:53,858 --> 00:09:55,518
And now my
pinky's going numb.

231
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,960
I guess everything started to change
at the beginning of last summer.

232
00:09:58,961 --> 00:10:01,359
He partnered with his
old friend, Hugo,

233
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,161
and they finally got
accepted for eight months

234
00:10:03,162 --> 00:10:05,667
on the new digital telescope
at the Space Center.

235
00:10:05,668 --> 00:10:08,227
Everything was normal
for two weeks and then,

236
00:10:08,228 --> 00:10:10,567
suddenly, Bryant started
to work really long hours.

237
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,836
I see.

238
00:10:13,144 --> 00:10:14,337
What do you think of this?

239
00:10:14,338 --> 00:10:15,400
I like it.

240
00:10:15,401 --> 00:10:18,813
It was a gift. A friend.
He's a glass blower.

241
00:10:20,318 --> 00:10:22,182
Would you say that's when he
started feeling sick, Mary?

242
00:10:22,183 --> 00:10:24,277
Not sick,
just a little off.

243
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:26,550
Oh! We did cancel
our Fourth of July trip,

244
00:10:26,551 --> 00:10:28,558
so I guess it was
around that time.

245
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:30,684
I'm sorry, something
is really bugging me.

246
00:10:30,685 --> 00:10:32,353
Your name is Lassiter, too?

247
00:10:32,354 --> 00:10:35,125
Yes, that's correct.
Carlton Lassiter.

248
00:10:35,126 --> 00:10:39,067
But you're not affiliated with the
detective Carlton Lassiter who I met before?

249
00:10:39,068 --> 00:10:41,866
Not in any way, shape or
form. Different department.

250
00:10:41,867 --> 00:10:44,534
Matter of fact,
I spell mine with a "K."

251
00:10:44,843 --> 00:10:46,105
Two of them.

252
00:10:47,245 --> 00:10:50,681
Mary, is there anything
you're leaving out?

253
00:10:51,349 --> 00:10:53,612
Maybe something that's
slipped your mind,

254
00:10:53,613 --> 00:10:55,277
something you're
not telling me because

255
00:10:55,754 --> 00:10:59,382
<i>it may embarrass
andlor shame you.</i>

256
00:10:59,383 --> 00:11:01,118
It could be vital.

257
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:04,653
I know this probably isn't true,
but I started to suspect that he...

258
00:11:04,654 --> 00:11:06,218
Was cheating on you.

259
00:11:06,219 --> 00:11:07,957
Well, yes.
How did you know?

260
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,056
A shot in the dark.

261
00:11:09,057 --> 00:11:11,931
The long hours. He was
consumed with his work.

262
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:15,768
He was different. Distant. I don't
even like to say it out loud.

263
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:16,999
Please, don't.

264
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,511
Bryant wasn't really the type. We were
planning a future. He wanted to try for a baby.

265
00:11:21,512 --> 00:11:23,206
He was a good man.

266
00:11:23,415 --> 00:11:25,143
Thanks again for
coming in, Mary.

267
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:26,978
No problem, Kkarlton.

268
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:29,053
If we uncover any...
Carlton?

269
00:11:29,587 --> 00:11:31,611
Yes, Karlton, with a "K."

270
00:11:31,612 --> 00:11:33,590
Two "K"s. The
second one is silent.

271
00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:38,692
May I speak to you privately
in your office, Kkarlton?

272
00:11:38,693 --> 00:11:39,956
Certainly.

273
00:11:39,957 --> 00:11:41,555
We'll be in touch.
Thanks.

274
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:45,364
What are you doing reopening
the Vallery case?

275
00:11:45,365 --> 00:11:47,961
Reopening? Come on. That
word has so many syllables.

276
00:11:47,962 --> 00:11:50,131
That case was determined
not to be a case,

277
00:11:50,132 --> 00:11:52,471
despite Detective Lassiter's
best efforts.

278
00:11:52,472 --> 00:11:53,838
Shawn!

279
00:11:54,312 --> 00:11:58,042
Now, I need a whole lot
of an explanation from you,

280
00:11:58,043 --> 00:12:00,879
because, although you do
make me laugh occasionally,

281
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,316
impersonating an officer is...

282
00:12:02,317 --> 00:12:03,751
Impersonating an officer?
Please.

283
00:12:03,752 --> 00:12:06,289
I told that woman
I was in accounts payable.

284
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,052
Shawn, come clean.

285
00:12:09,194 --> 00:12:11,753
I would like to solve
this case for Lassiter.

286
00:12:11,754 --> 00:12:12,887
He'll never allow it.

287
00:12:12,888 --> 00:12:14,260
That's why he can't
know I'm involved.

288
00:12:14,261 --> 00:12:16,765
I figure I can guide him
through this thing, right?

289
00:12:16,766 --> 00:12:18,734
Build him up, get him
back on his feet again.

290
00:12:18,735 --> 00:12:20,292
You're serious?
Yeah.

291
00:12:20,293 --> 00:12:21,632
Why?

292
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:25,071
I just feel like
he really needs this.

293
00:12:26,444 --> 00:12:27,934
I mean, look at him.

294
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,506
Okay, I'm in.

295
00:12:30,782 --> 00:12:31,805
You're what?

296
00:12:31,806 --> 00:12:33,009
What do you got?

297
00:12:42,627 --> 00:12:44,787
My Dad is not answering
his phone. So?

298
00:12:44,788 --> 00:12:48,264
So, he's always home, and he always
answers his phone after two rings.

299
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,424
This is actually
somewhat troubling.

300
00:12:50,425 --> 00:12:51,491
Why?

301
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,301
Why? Fish Derby is on.

302
00:12:54,302 --> 00:12:55,395
What is this?

303
00:12:55,396 --> 00:12:56,564
It's the Bryant Vallery case.

304
00:12:56,565 --> 00:12:57,698
The one from this morning?

305
00:12:57,699 --> 00:12:58,799
And the rest
of the week.

306
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,176
I predict we will solve it
Friday at 10:01 p.m.

307
00:13:02,547 --> 00:13:03,843
And then maybe
watch some cable.

308
00:13:03,844 --> 00:13:04,903
Sounds great.

309
00:13:04,904 --> 00:13:06,916
And did you find a partner that's
willing to do this with you?

310
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:10,512
Jules is in. My Dad is
clearly missing, or something.

311
00:13:11,022 --> 00:13:12,613
Dude, that leaves you!

312
00:13:12,614 --> 00:13:14,452
Gus, you get to step up
in a big fat way.

313
00:13:14,453 --> 00:13:16,891
You have one job.
I have two jobs, Shawn.

314
00:13:16,892 --> 00:13:19,224
I have presentations to
memorize on three new drugs.

315
00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:22,163
And while you were out drinking
last night and taking on free cases,

316
00:13:22,164 --> 00:13:23,324
I was up half the night
dreaming about

317
00:13:23,325 --> 00:13:25,231
whether the gel caps are more
effective than the tablets.

318
00:13:25,232 --> 00:13:29,000
First of all, tablets. Always
tablets, that's a given.

319
00:13:29,274 --> 00:13:31,867
Secondly, I've been having
this reoccurring dream

320
00:13:31,868 --> 00:13:36,036
where I'm flying over Auckland on the
back of a swan made primarily of cocoa.

321
00:13:36,037 --> 00:13:37,614
His name is Clem.

322
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:40,984
But your dream was
pretty interesting, too.

323
00:13:41,286 --> 00:13:45,312
And thirdly, I guarantee you
that after you hear this reason,

324
00:13:45,313 --> 00:13:47,186
you will definitely want
to take this case.

325
00:13:47,187 --> 00:13:49,191
I doubt it
but give it a shot.

326
00:13:49,192 --> 00:13:51,693
The victim was
an astronomer. Yeah.

327
00:13:51,694 --> 00:13:55,164
The guy died while he was working
the night sky at the observatory.

328
00:13:59,671 --> 00:14:02,332
What would make you think
that would matter?

329
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,931
Oh, come on! I know you go
down to the Space Center.

330
00:14:04,932 --> 00:14:06,600
That's preposterous, Shawn.
Thursdays.

331
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:08,941
I'm never down... In the
afternoon, usually around 2:00.

332
00:14:08,942 --> 00:14:10,001
Have you been following me?

333
00:14:10,002 --> 00:14:11,776
Maybe. Sometimes.

334
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:15,011
To sharpen and refine
my tailing skills, yes.

335
00:14:15,012 --> 00:14:17,053
This is exactly the sort of
thing I was talking about, Shawn.

336
00:14:17,054 --> 00:14:19,782
Okay, I apologize, Gus,
I do. But it's all good.

337
00:14:19,783 --> 00:14:21,916
So you like astronomy.
I accept that.

338
00:14:21,917 --> 00:14:23,084
This conversation is over.

339
00:14:23,085 --> 00:14:25,151
Okay, don't go all
Vincent Gallo on me.

340
00:14:25,152 --> 00:14:26,856
We're just getting
started, man.

341
00:14:26,857 --> 00:14:30,366
Look, some guy dies at a Space Center
that you frequently sneak off to.

342
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:34,598
We gotta get down there and we
gotta do some serious space digging.

343
00:14:34,599 --> 00:14:36,263
No, we don't.
As a matter of fact,

344
00:14:36,264 --> 00:14:38,331
now that I know that you're
tailing me while I'm at work,

345
00:14:38,332 --> 00:14:39,568
get ready to get
lost in my dust.

346
00:14:39,569 --> 00:14:40,769
Okay. Dust?

347
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:41,902
What, are you
going off-roading?

348
00:14:41,903 --> 00:14:44,140
I'm gonna be un-catchable,
like a jackal.

349
00:14:44,141 --> 00:14:45,477
Like a jackal?

350
00:14:46,384 --> 00:14:48,351
How about I just tail you
to the observatory?

351
00:14:48,352 --> 00:14:50,478
Consider me stealth, Shawn.

352
00:14:52,056 --> 00:14:54,854
That's weird. It's like
you're a bobble head.

353
00:15:51,449 --> 00:15:53,610
Excuse me,
I have an annual pass and...

354
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:56,214
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

355
00:15:56,215 --> 00:15:59,279
Didn't see you standing there,
you know, being so stealth-like.

356
00:16:02,051 --> 00:16:03,787
<i>The Jackal has arrived.</i>

357
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,388
What are
you doing, Shawn?

358
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:11,957
What are we doing.
Dude, we're undercover.

359
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,263
We are not undercover.
Sure, we are.

360
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:14,531
I'm the employee,
you're the customer.

361
00:16:14,532 --> 00:16:15,593
I am the customer.

362
00:16:15,594 --> 00:16:17,333
See? You're already in
character, like Don Cheadle!

363
00:16:17,334 --> 00:16:18,567
I'm not involved
with this case.

364
00:16:18,568 --> 00:16:20,075
I only need you
for a minute.

365
00:16:20,076 --> 00:16:21,838
Like when Kenickie
needed Danny Zuko.

366
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,005
And you get to be Travolta
in the analogy.

367
00:16:24,006 --> 00:16:25,946
Tomorrow, they're training me
on the motion simulator.

368
00:16:25,947 --> 00:16:28,746
Tell me you've never wanted to take a
ride on one of those things buck-naked.

369
00:16:28,747 --> 00:16:29,877
No, I haven't.

370
00:16:29,878 --> 00:16:30,942
Sure you have.

371
00:16:30,943 --> 00:16:32,318
I'm only here for
a few minutes, anyway.

372
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:33,447
That's all I need.

373
00:16:33,448 --> 00:16:35,855
Look, there's this
creepy janitor that lurks about.

374
00:16:35,856 --> 00:16:37,985
I want you to distract him
while I grill planetarium girl.

375
00:16:37,986 --> 00:16:39,187
You are not
grilling Jessica.

376
00:16:39,188 --> 00:16:41,753
She's just interning here until
she gets her college units.

377
00:16:41,754 --> 00:16:42,958
Jessica?
Yeah!

378
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,899
How do you know
her name is...

379
00:16:46,025 --> 00:16:48,069
Oh, Gus.
What?

380
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:51,073
You haven't been coming here
on Thursdays to study the stars.

381
00:16:51,074 --> 00:16:52,631
You've been coming
here for her!

382
00:16:52,632 --> 00:16:53,869
Do you love her?
Shut up, Shawn.

383
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,070
You're in love with her.
Shut up, Shawn.

384
00:16:55,071 --> 00:16:56,442
I'm gonna go hook you
guys up. No, Shawn.

385
00:16:56,443 --> 00:16:58,504
She is my co-worker
and I have the inside track.

386
00:16:58,505 --> 00:17:00,345
Listen, there are ways
to go about doing this.

387
00:17:00,346 --> 00:17:02,351
You don't just walk up to somebody
at their place of employment

388
00:17:02,352 --> 00:17:04,512
and start working them over.
You've got to have a plan.

389
00:17:04,513 --> 00:17:06,249
Do you have a plan?
Of course I have a plan.

390
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,689
Well, would you mind
clueing me in, please?

391
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,350
All right, listen.

392
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,821
She's been through a lot
lately. She just had...

393
00:17:13,822 --> 00:17:15,421
Broke up with
her boyfriend.

394
00:17:15,422 --> 00:17:17,364
How'd you know that?
It's my curse, apparently.

395
00:17:17,365 --> 00:17:20,699
Well, since she's just off a
break-up, I gotta move gradually.

396
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,932
Just go over there and ask
her out. Get her digits.

397
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:26,498
Shawn, this is a quality girl. That
means I got to put in quality time, okay?

398
00:17:26,499 --> 00:17:28,442
Oh, here she comes.
Act natural.

399
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,011
Hey, Jessie,

400
00:17:31,816 --> 00:17:33,009
do you know Gus?

401
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,812
Yes. Gus is
a regular.

402
00:17:34,813 --> 00:17:35,874
That's right.

403
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,817
You know, I went to
high school with him.

404
00:17:37,818 --> 00:17:40,686
Of course, I didn't hang out with
cool kids like Gus in high school.

405
00:17:40,687 --> 00:17:43,248
He was a CIF wrestling
champion back then.

406
00:17:43,249 --> 00:17:44,350
Really?

407
00:17:44,351 --> 00:17:46,692
True as toast. And in college,
he was a Heisman candidate

408
00:17:46,693 --> 00:17:48,025
till he blew his knee out.

409
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:50,794
Don't act all surprised. We were all
following you in the newspapers, man.

410
00:17:50,795 --> 00:17:51,891
You're kidding.

411
00:17:51,892 --> 00:17:54,164
Well, he is, actually.
I don't kid, ever.

412
00:17:54,472 --> 00:17:57,907
I idolize this guy. The
coolest dude I have ever known.

413
00:17:57,908 --> 00:18:00,875
Wow, Gus, it seems there's a
lot I don't know about you.

414
00:18:00,876 --> 00:18:03,139
Well, there is... Hey, you guys
should totally talk, you know?

415
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,840
Share stuff and whatnot.

416
00:18:04,841 --> 00:18:06,543
But don't let this guy
grill you too much.

417
00:18:07,948 --> 00:18:11,476
Yeah, well, I'd love to, but I
have to start the planetarium show.

418
00:18:11,477 --> 00:18:13,579
Yes, she has a planetarium show
to start. Oh, can I do that?

419
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,817
Have you been trained
on the show?

420
00:18:14,818 --> 00:18:17,758
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, Jess, I just
did the checklist, like, an hour ago.

421
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:19,558
Perfect score. Uh...

422
00:18:20,498 --> 00:18:22,363
Question 18 has a typo.

423
00:18:23,534 --> 00:18:25,728
Okay, great!
Go ahead then.

424
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:26,996
Are you serious?

425
00:18:26,997 --> 00:18:28,469
Oh, this is great!
Great.

426
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:31,905
All right, I got it. No
worries. No worries. I got it.

427
00:18:31,906 --> 00:18:33,466
Thanks, Shawn.

428
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:36,410
That guy.
You heard about Pluto?

429
00:18:37,381 --> 00:18:38,939
It's messed up, right?
Mmm-hmm.

430
00:18:44,489 --> 00:18:45,978
Here's the
Bryant Vallery file.

431
00:18:45,979 --> 00:18:48,251
The what?
Wait... The astronomer?

432
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,793
Yes, and I just finished the
follow-up with Mary, the widow.

433
00:18:50,794 --> 00:18:52,351
You what?
You asked me to.

434
00:18:52,352 --> 00:18:53,953
I did?
It was in passing.

435
00:18:53,954 --> 00:18:56,498
And wow,
did it ever pay off!

436
00:18:56,499 --> 00:18:58,534
You were right about
the affair. I was?

437
00:18:58,535 --> 00:19:00,968
Yeah, the wife totally
suspected it. She what?

438
00:19:00,969 --> 00:19:03,165
That he potentially was
having an affair.

439
00:19:04,675 --> 00:19:06,665
Well, isn't that interesting?

440
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,938
I want to re-interview
everybody.

441
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,639
And get me a copy
of the Coroner's report.

442
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,774
I told you there was
more to this case.

443
00:19:16,654 --> 00:19:18,315
<i>Hello, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

444
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,653
<i>I will be your narrator.</i>

445
00:19:22,894 --> 00:19:26,125
<i>My name is Aurora Borealis.</i>

446
00:19:27,198 --> 00:19:32,363
<i>There are over 400 stars</i>

447
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,094
<i>in our galaxy.</i>

448
00:19:34,872 --> 00:19:37,306
<i>Maybe more.
No one knows for sure.</i>

449
00:19:37,508 --> 00:19:42,104
<i>Many have said that the universe
is even larger than the Indian Ocean.</i>

450
00:19:43,414 --> 00:19:45,541
<i>And that is why it is called</i>

451
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,176
<i>Infinitum</i>

452
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:50,714
<i>Staroctopusium.</i>

453
00:19:51,155 --> 00:19:52,588
<i>Ah, yes.</i>

454
00:19:53,324 --> 00:19:57,124
<i>Our glorious constellations.
There they all are. Take a look.</i>

455
00:19:58,129 --> 00:20:02,156
<i>Over here we have
one with a guy</i>

456
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,732
<i>holding some sort of thing.</i>

457
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:10,432
<i>Over here, our beloved
Olympic rings, all seven of them.</i>

458
00:20:10,433 --> 00:20:11,839
<i>And here...</i>

459
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,140
<i>Here's one with a fish.</i>

460
00:20:14,141 --> 00:20:15,702
You gotta name them.

461
00:20:16,981 --> 00:20:19,415
<i>Notice straight...</i>

462
00:20:19,684 --> 00:20:23,619
<i>Straight above you,
the Hammer of Jeff.</i>

463
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,845
<i>And over there
in the south...</i>

464
00:20:24,846 --> 00:20:26,183
<i>North.
North,</i>

465
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:29,691
<i>you will see
Monkey with Rash.</i>

466
00:20:30,094 --> 00:20:32,619
<i>The Egyptians used to set
their clocks by him.</i>

467
00:20:33,397 --> 00:20:35,956
<i>Oh look! There goes
an asteroid. Comet.</i>

468
00:20:35,957 --> 00:20:39,001
<i>Comet! It's what they named
that cleaning solution after.</i>

469
00:20:39,002 --> 00:20:41,435
<i>I know it may stink
when you leave it in the sink</i>

470
00:20:41,436 --> 00:20:44,496
<i>but, boy, oh boy,
does it clean!</i>

471
00:20:44,497 --> 00:20:46,565
Is there a reason you're
standing so close to me?

472
00:20:46,566 --> 00:20:47,667
Just looking.

473
00:20:47,668 --> 00:20:49,211
Yeah, well, that's the
great thing about looking,

474
00:20:49,212 --> 00:20:51,908
you can do it from
far, far away.

475
00:20:55,653 --> 00:20:57,678
<i>And now, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

476
00:20:58,322 --> 00:21:00,313
<i>I implore you to enjoy</i>

477
00:21:01,158 --> 00:21:04,457
<i>the majesty of the heavens.</i>

478
00:22:06,624 --> 00:22:07,612
Hey.

479
00:22:07,613 --> 00:22:08,783
You work here?

480
00:22:08,784 --> 00:22:12,260
No, I just happen to own
my own space suit.

481
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:15,729
A smart-ass. I like
that. Get over here, kid.

482
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,259
Do me a favor.

483
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,361
Keep your finger on the space
bar while I adjust this.

484
00:22:20,571 --> 00:22:22,037
Like this?
Uh-huh.

485
00:22:22,038 --> 00:22:23,367
You're gonna trust me
with this?

486
00:22:23,368 --> 00:22:26,001
I don't have a lot of other
options, do I, space man?

487
00:22:31,682 --> 00:22:34,775
I gotta be honest. This
seems like a job for two, no?

488
00:22:34,776 --> 00:22:35,909
Sometimes it is.

489
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:37,543
But once the scope is in
place, all you got to do

490
00:22:37,544 --> 00:22:40,145
is watch the monitor, hoping to
catch things that nobody else has.

491
00:22:40,146 --> 00:22:41,850
You know, if you got a
partner, you can switch off,

492
00:22:41,851 --> 00:22:45,156
you know, rest your eyes, maybe make
calculations on what you've seen,

493
00:22:45,157 --> 00:22:48,824
or just break up the silence
of staring into the unknown.

494
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,992
So, where's your partner?

495
00:22:51,402 --> 00:22:52,993
Yeah, well that's
the bad part of it.

496
00:22:52,994 --> 00:22:55,368
He passed away
not too long ago.

497
00:22:55,706 --> 00:22:58,674
You know, the Buddhists have
this saying about moving on,

498
00:22:58,675 --> 00:23:01,336
honoring the work...
But I don't remember it.

499
00:23:01,337 --> 00:23:05,246
What I do know is that I realize I'm too
old to be doing this stuff all alone.

500
00:23:06,117 --> 00:23:08,550
So, you're
continuing the work, huh?

501
00:23:08,551 --> 00:23:11,610
Bryant would return
from the grave if I didn't.

502
00:23:11,611 --> 00:23:14,451
You know, we petitioned for
five years for use of this scope.

503
00:23:14,452 --> 00:23:17,721
And we got lucky. No, no,
no. No, no. Don't touch, no.

504
00:23:17,722 --> 00:23:20,661
I mean, once you get in here, you gotta
find what you're looking for, fast.

505
00:23:20,662 --> 00:23:23,291
We had eight months.
Bryant saw six.

506
00:23:23,634 --> 00:23:25,225
Eight months seems like
a good chunk of time.

507
00:23:25,226 --> 00:23:26,825
Not in astronomy.

508
00:23:26,826 --> 00:23:29,394
See, once you find it,
you gotta track it.

509
00:23:29,395 --> 00:23:31,667
Okay? And then it's not a
discovery until you chart it

510
00:23:31,668 --> 00:23:34,175
and then it goes around
again and then you prove it.

511
00:23:34,176 --> 00:23:36,144
Must get lonely.

512
00:23:36,145 --> 00:23:37,737
I let you in
here, didn't I?

513
00:23:38,249 --> 00:23:41,513
Look, I just talk. You know?
I've got the gift of gab.

514
00:23:41,514 --> 00:23:44,178
Jeez, I'll talk
to anybody, I suppose.

515
00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:47,155
So, you still haven't found
what you're looking for, huh?

516
00:23:47,156 --> 00:23:51,592
No, but when I do, you'll
read about it, believe me.

517
00:23:51,593 --> 00:23:52,922
You'll read about it.

518
00:23:52,923 --> 00:23:55,087
My real goal is
to become an astronomer.

519
00:23:55,088 --> 00:23:56,564
See something no one else has.

520
00:23:56,565 --> 00:24:00,433
I don't even need to make a big,
flashy discovery, or name a star,

521
00:24:00,434 --> 00:24:02,403
or become famous like
most of these guys want.

522
00:24:02,404 --> 00:24:03,496
Yeah.

523
00:24:03,497 --> 00:24:05,939
All I've ever really wanted
is to know I made a difference.

524
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,569
That's great, knowing what you
want to do since you were a kid.

525
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:09,737
That's a gift.

526
00:24:09,738 --> 00:24:10,905
Thanks.

527
00:24:10,906 --> 00:24:12,379
You know, you're a
great listener, Gus.

528
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,782
Oh, well, it's easy to talk to
you, Jessica. I mean, it's...

529
00:24:15,783 --> 00:24:17,114
Is something wrong?

530
00:24:17,115 --> 00:24:18,984
<i>They've been in
there 45 minutes.</i>

531
00:24:18,985 --> 00:24:20,113
So?

532
00:24:20,114 --> 00:24:21,748
It's a four-minute show.

533
00:24:21,749 --> 00:24:24,123
And that, ladies and
gentlemen, is precisely why

534
00:24:24,124 --> 00:24:28,928
time travel is not only possible,
but may have already happened.

535
00:24:39,543 --> 00:24:41,066
So, I met the
other astronomer.

536
00:24:41,067 --> 00:24:43,977
Nice guy. Chatty.
Hiding something.

537
00:24:43,978 --> 00:24:45,071
Something nefarious?

538
00:24:45,072 --> 00:24:46,877
I don't know yet.
How'd you do?

539
00:24:46,878 --> 00:24:48,975
Please, Shawn.
How do you think?

540
00:24:48,976 --> 00:24:51,247
Digits?
You know this.

541
00:24:51,248 --> 00:24:53,255
Nice! We're going
out tomorrow.

542
00:24:53,256 --> 00:24:55,223
It's all coming
together, man.

543
00:24:55,224 --> 00:24:57,316
Juliet called. She ran our
dead guy's phone records.

544
00:24:57,317 --> 00:24:58,485
We gotta meet her
at the station.

545
00:24:58,486 --> 00:25:00,256
You bet, let's go.
Whoa! Not now.

546
00:25:00,257 --> 00:25:01,888
5:00.
Why 5:00?

547
00:25:01,889 --> 00:25:05,367
Gus, I can't just leave
willy-nilly whenever I want.

548
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:07,296
I have a job to do here.

549
00:25:13,544 --> 00:25:16,512
I don't care what the Coroner says.
Healthy hearts do not just stop.

550
00:25:16,513 --> 00:25:19,615
But you know what? I got a
golf buddy who's a cardiologist.

551
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,910
I'm gonna run
these by him.

552
00:25:20,911 --> 00:25:22,680
Mind the store,
I'll be back.

553
00:25:25,055 --> 00:25:27,284
Hey!

554
00:25:27,285 --> 00:25:31,157
Okay, so we ran the home, the work, and
the cell phone records of Bryant Vallery.

555
00:25:31,158 --> 00:25:34,162
We got nothing on the home phone, a
few strange hits on the work line,

556
00:25:34,163 --> 00:25:36,528
but when we ran the cell
phone, we hit the jackpot.

557
00:25:36,529 --> 00:25:39,193
We found a number that he
calls, only from his cell phone,

558
00:25:39,194 --> 00:25:41,635
all hours of the night,
way too often for business.

559
00:25:41,636 --> 00:25:43,433
Unless it's monkey
business. Sweet!

560
00:25:43,434 --> 00:25:45,804
So we contacted the cell
phone company for the name.

561
00:25:45,805 --> 00:25:50,608
The number is 555-019...

562
00:25:50,609 --> 00:25:52,148
Where is it?

563
00:25:57,855 --> 00:25:59,287
Oh, here it is.

564
00:25:59,288 --> 00:26:01,620
555-019...
Nine?

565
00:26:02,893 --> 00:26:04,291
Wow, that's good.

566
00:26:04,292 --> 00:26:05,692
Not really.

567
00:26:11,502 --> 00:26:14,265
So, she had an affair with a
married guy and probably lied about it.

568
00:26:14,266 --> 00:26:15,395
That doesn't
mean she's guilty.

569
00:26:15,396 --> 00:26:18,065
Shawn, you're confusing me. You're the
one who loves to jump to conclusions,

570
00:26:18,066 --> 00:26:19,165
and you're not even
hopping towards this one.

571
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:20,539
Hopping?
It doesn't track, Gus.

572
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,305
Why would she kill him?
She broke up with a guy.

573
00:26:22,306 --> 00:26:23,675
It's him.
He dumped her.

574
00:26:23,676 --> 00:26:24,804
So, why doesn't she
mention to you

575
00:26:24,805 --> 00:26:26,348
that her ex-boyfriend
just bit the dust?

576
00:26:26,349 --> 00:26:29,044
What's she gonna say? "Hey, how's
it going? My boyfriend just died.

577
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,585
"He might have been killed.
Maybe it was me."

578
00:26:30,586 --> 00:26:32,244
I doubt she chortles.

579
00:26:32,245 --> 00:26:33,480
Damn, she was so
damn good-looking.

580
00:26:33,481 --> 00:26:35,888
And she still is, Gus.

581
00:26:35,889 --> 00:26:38,257
Even if we have a who,
we don't have a clear motive

582
00:26:38,258 --> 00:26:39,986
and we certainly
don't have the method.

583
00:26:39,987 --> 00:26:41,758
We can't give up
on our other suspects.

584
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:42,924
What we need to do

585
00:26:43,989 --> 00:26:45,365
Is keep looking.

586
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,727
You're gonna
set off the alarm.

587
00:26:47,728 --> 00:26:49,135
Clearly, I have
a security pass.

588
00:26:49,136 --> 00:26:50,365
They gave you
a security pass?

589
00:26:50,366 --> 00:26:52,431
They gave Dave the cheddar
corn guy a security pass,

590
00:26:52,432 --> 00:26:54,442
I merely stumbled
upon it by happenstance.

591
00:26:54,443 --> 00:26:55,636
And by happenstance,
you mean?

592
00:26:55,637 --> 00:26:57,077
I swiped it
from his gym bag

593
00:26:57,078 --> 00:26:59,239
while he was shaking a Milky Way
loose from the vending machine.

594
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,874
Damn it! I...

595
00:27:01,752 --> 00:27:02,979
What are you
doing, Shawn?

596
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,679
What I don't
have is a key.

597
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,551
That's not right.
What?

598
00:27:06,552 --> 00:27:08,090
I'm sorry.
I just... I...

599
00:27:08,091 --> 00:27:09,749
I left my pogo stick
in there and I just...

600
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,191
No, I mean you're
not doing it right.

601
00:27:11,192 --> 00:27:13,660
You gotta move upward if you
wanna get the latch to disengage.

602
00:27:13,661 --> 00:27:14,993
Let me do it.

603
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:18,259
Uh... Don't you have
a key for that, or...

604
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,323
For this room? No.

605
00:27:19,324 --> 00:27:22,428
Big bad Bryant took it away a
few weeks after they got here.

606
00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:23,631
Why?

607
00:27:23,974 --> 00:27:27,465
A few small items go missing and
suddenly everyone gets suspicious.

608
00:27:27,466 --> 00:27:28,805
Items such as?

609
00:27:28,806 --> 00:27:30,903
A watch. A comb. Some mail.

610
00:27:30,904 --> 00:27:32,004
Whose mail?

611
00:27:32,005 --> 00:27:33,810
The dead guy, Bryant.

612
00:27:33,811 --> 00:27:35,442
Did you read it?
Well, of course I did.

613
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:38,815
You know, he became quite a jerk. I
don't know if Hugo knows this or not,

614
00:27:38,816 --> 00:27:41,050
but he was dissolving
the partnership.

615
00:27:41,392 --> 00:27:43,825
Apparently, he had some big
plans for himself. I don't know.

616
00:27:43,826 --> 00:27:47,329
Correspondence for jobs
he didn't seem qualified for,

617
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:50,298
heading university
departments, NASA...

618
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:51,628
NASA?

619
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:53,293
Now. Who are
you guys again?

620
00:27:53,294 --> 00:27:55,802
We think something bad
went down in there.

621
00:27:55,803 --> 00:27:59,136
Yes, something bad
did go down in here.

622
00:28:01,011 --> 00:28:02,910
Did you
see anything?

623
00:28:02,911 --> 00:28:05,504
No. But you know,
the dead guy, he changed.

624
00:28:05,505 --> 00:28:06,639
They were friends
at the beginning.

625
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,014
Hugo was always being
nice to him, you know?

626
00:28:09,015 --> 00:28:12,054
In fact, Hugo's the only one
around here who's nice to me.

627
00:28:12,055 --> 00:28:13,953
Brings me coffee
in the mornings,

628
00:28:14,258 --> 00:28:16,089
although he brings
it for everybody,

629
00:28:16,493 --> 00:28:17,983
all four of us.

630
00:28:18,662 --> 00:28:19,685
Three of us.

631
00:28:19,686 --> 00:28:21,320
Stallings, I'll be nice
to you, just do me a favor.

632
00:28:21,321 --> 00:28:23,263
Stop stealing the gum
out of my locker. Okay?

633
00:28:25,335 --> 00:28:27,029
You spotted that?
Sure did.

634
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,663
Hey, do you know
how these books work?

635
00:28:29,664 --> 00:28:33,903
Oh, they switch up every couple
of hours. One looks, one writes.

636
00:28:33,904 --> 00:28:37,002
Yeah, they do it from dark
till dusk all the time.

637
00:28:37,003 --> 00:28:38,377
Hugo's here.

638
00:28:38,378 --> 00:28:39,506
How do you know that?

639
00:28:39,507 --> 00:28:40,810
He gets here at the
same time every day.

640
00:28:40,811 --> 00:28:42,681
You could set
your clock to it.

641
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:46,081
Hey, you should hurry.
You don't have long.

642
00:28:46,082 --> 00:28:48,021
Thanks, dude.
Uh-huh.

643
00:28:52,329 --> 00:28:53,795
Gus, come check this out.
What?

644
00:28:53,796 --> 00:28:55,228
Look, there's a page missing
from this logbook.

645
00:28:55,229 --> 00:28:56,788
I noticed it
the first time I was here.

646
00:28:56,789 --> 00:28:58,027
Look.

647
00:28:59,036 --> 00:29:00,195
June 21st.

648
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,463
What does
the book track?

649
00:29:01,464 --> 00:29:04,802
It's like Stallings said. It's like,
every manual adjustment they make,

650
00:29:04,803 --> 00:29:06,569
who does it, which
guy was on the scope.

651
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:09,236
See, it looks like they switch
shifts about every two hours. Right?

652
00:29:09,237 --> 00:29:10,677
So, why remove this page?

653
00:29:10,678 --> 00:29:13,716
<i>It goes from 8:39 with Hugo
to 10:42 with Bryant.</i>

654
00:29:13,717 --> 00:29:19,050
<i>So the question is, what happened
between 8:39 and 10:42 on June 21st?</i>

655
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:20,646
Some bad juju.

656
00:29:20,647 --> 00:29:22,191
We gotta get out of here.

657
00:29:22,459 --> 00:29:23,925
Why?
Why?

658
00:29:23,926 --> 00:29:27,122
Gus, someone finds me in
here, I could get fired.

659
00:29:29,032 --> 00:29:30,829
Why do you keep
running like that?

660
00:29:32,503 --> 00:29:33,526
Hey, you guys.

661
00:29:33,527 --> 00:29:35,162
Hey. What's up?

662
00:29:35,572 --> 00:29:36,595
Gus, about tonight...

663
00:29:36,596 --> 00:29:38,606
Oh, if you have other
obligations, that's cool.

664
00:29:38,607 --> 00:29:41,575
No, I just wanted to see if
we could go at 6:30 instead.

665
00:29:41,576 --> 00:29:43,736
That's perfect.
That's even better.

666
00:29:43,737 --> 00:29:46,577
Look, I need to borrow
your motorcycle tonight.

667
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:47,775
You can use
my little blue car.

668
00:29:47,776 --> 00:29:48,976
Oh, yeah!
Do that, Gus.

669
00:29:48,977 --> 00:29:50,951
I get a little nervous
on motorcycles.

670
00:29:50,952 --> 00:29:52,715
Settled! Bye, Jess.

671
00:29:52,716 --> 00:29:53,848
Bye.

672
00:29:59,163 --> 00:30:01,426
Think you
want this one.

673
00:30:01,427 --> 00:30:03,465
What's that
in his case?

674
00:30:03,466 --> 00:30:05,263
Tracking readouts.

675
00:30:05,502 --> 00:30:08,368
Dude, it's just a bunch of paperwork.
I saw it at the observatory.

676
00:30:08,369 --> 00:30:09,699
Why does he keep it
locked up like that?

677
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,796
That's a
good question.

678
00:30:10,797 --> 00:30:12,841
Morning, gentlemen.
You up already?

679
00:30:12,842 --> 00:30:15,036
I had to check the
timers on the crab spray.

680
00:30:15,037 --> 00:30:16,601
You need any help
with that giant thing?

681
00:30:16,602 --> 00:30:17,805
Nah, I can manage it.

682
00:30:17,806 --> 00:30:19,814
Only got two more weeks
of this before my time's up.

683
00:30:19,815 --> 00:30:22,078
Might as well follow it
through to the end.

684
00:30:23,654 --> 00:30:25,143
You know
what that means.

685
00:30:25,144 --> 00:30:26,449
I have no idea
what that means.

686
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,855
That means he's
not at his house.

687
00:30:29,326 --> 00:30:30,554
So?

688
00:30:31,428 --> 00:30:33,827
Rainier's not exactly
a high roller, huh?

689
00:30:33,828 --> 00:30:34,954
No.
Look at that.

690
00:30:34,955 --> 00:30:37,261
It should say,
"Welcome to camp something."

691
00:30:37,262 --> 00:30:38,698
Huh!

692
00:30:38,699 --> 00:30:41,202
Stargazing isn't the
most lucrative field.

693
00:30:41,203 --> 00:30:44,137
Well, you can make up to a hundred
grand a year on the lecture circuit

694
00:30:44,138 --> 00:30:45,197
if you're a name.

695
00:30:48,579 --> 00:30:50,012
You're gonna break that.

696
00:30:52,649 --> 00:30:53,877
I don't think so!

697
00:30:55,986 --> 00:30:57,453
Whoa!
What?

698
00:30:57,654 --> 00:30:59,349
Oh, boy!

699
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:02,792
What is this
awful purple stuff?

700
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,317
They're flowers.

701
00:31:04,318 --> 00:31:05,621
Flowers?
It's a garden.

702
00:31:05,622 --> 00:31:09,357
It's a vegetable garden. These
are flowers, weird flowers.

703
00:31:09,358 --> 00:31:10,729
What are you doing?

704
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:11,889
Well, I gotta
check this out.

705
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:13,060
Let Lassiter do that.

706
00:31:13,061 --> 00:31:15,433
Gus, Lassiter has
to come here on his own.

707
00:31:15,434 --> 00:31:17,597
And he has gotta be right.

708
00:31:17,598 --> 00:31:19,732
So, who you gonna get
to check that out for us?

709
00:31:19,733 --> 00:31:22,643
Well, who else do you know who
spends all day in his yard?

710
00:31:24,781 --> 00:31:26,112
Shawn!

711
00:31:26,516 --> 00:31:28,483
Oh, you shouldn't have.

712
00:31:28,484 --> 00:31:30,519
Dad, we need to
talk business.

713
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,020
You're not answering your phone.
What's going on? Did you even check it?

714
00:31:33,021 --> 00:31:34,647
My phone's been fine, Shawn.

715
00:31:34,648 --> 00:31:36,123
I'm just a little
busy right now.

716
00:31:36,124 --> 00:31:37,853
Busy with what?
Things, Shawn.

717
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:38,916
I have things.

718
00:31:38,917 --> 00:31:41,931
Henry, where
are the towels?

719
00:31:42,699 --> 00:31:45,259
Yeah, I'll tell
you in a minute.

720
00:31:45,936 --> 00:31:48,267
Was that a woman?
You have a woman in there?

721
00:31:48,268 --> 00:31:49,770
What do you think?

722
00:31:49,771 --> 00:31:51,670
Where did you meet a woman?

723
00:31:51,671 --> 00:31:52,730
Are you really interested?

724
00:31:52,731 --> 00:31:55,242
It's a question,
Dad. It's an enquiry.

725
00:31:55,243 --> 00:31:56,676
On the Internet.

726
00:31:56,677 --> 00:31:58,873
Shawn, look, she's a very
nice lady. Her name is Sylvia.

727
00:31:58,874 --> 00:32:02,112
She runs a catering
business, has two kids.

728
00:32:02,853 --> 00:32:04,012
Would you like to meet her?

729
00:32:04,013 --> 00:32:06,282
Oh, God, no!
Are you kidding?

730
00:32:06,556 --> 00:32:08,547
Good. Can we pick
this up tomorrow?

731
00:32:08,892 --> 00:32:10,188
Yeah, I'd be glad to.

732
00:32:10,189 --> 00:32:11,420
Good.

733
00:32:19,102 --> 00:32:20,932
You must have thought
your Dad dated again.

734
00:32:20,933 --> 00:32:23,233
Honestly, Gus, I haven't
given it a lot of thought.

735
00:32:23,234 --> 00:32:25,104
It's been 15 years.

736
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:29,503
Yeah, you know what? It's
fine. It's great. Good for him.

737
00:32:29,504 --> 00:32:30,669
You wanna
talk about it?

738
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:31,906
No.
Good.

739
00:32:31,907 --> 00:32:32,970
You left your plant there.

740
00:32:32,971 --> 00:32:34,346
I know. Wanna go
back and get it?

741
00:32:34,347 --> 00:32:35,476
No.

742
00:32:35,852 --> 00:32:39,150
Okay, June 21st is
missing from the logbook?

743
00:32:39,151 --> 00:32:40,381
No, I'll check on
that right away.

744
00:32:40,382 --> 00:32:43,220
Sweet. So, does
Lassiter need any more help?

745
00:32:43,221 --> 00:32:45,385
No, Shawn, he is on fire.

746
00:32:45,386 --> 00:32:49,124
He's already had the autopsy test rerun,
and he's contacted every relative he had.

747
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:50,324
Is that a personal
call, O'Hara?

748
00:32:50,325 --> 00:32:51,457
Yes.
Wrap it up.

749
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:53,866
I think I'm onto something. I think
he was killed by someone he knew.

750
00:32:53,867 --> 00:32:55,426
I gotta go.

751
00:32:55,427 --> 00:32:58,599
Bryant Vallery opened a safety
deposit box account in June.

752
00:32:58,809 --> 00:32:59,866
Was it around June 21st?

753
00:32:59,867 --> 00:33:01,034
What was June 21st?

754
00:33:01,035 --> 00:33:04,307
I don't know. Didn't you say
something about June 21st yesterday?

755
00:33:04,308 --> 00:33:08,374
I've said so many things in the
last few days. Refresh my memory.

756
00:33:10,954 --> 00:33:12,477
Dude, you look sharp.
Thank you.

757
00:33:12,478 --> 00:33:13,715
I've got one more
thing for you.

758
00:33:13,716 --> 00:33:14,950
What's that?

759
00:33:18,195 --> 00:33:19,354
You want me to wear a wire?

760
00:33:19,355 --> 00:33:20,987
Just this little
baby one.

761
00:33:21,198 --> 00:33:23,631
Look, in the event that
she actually did it, right?

762
00:33:23,632 --> 00:33:24,757
She's not gonna suspect you.

763
00:33:24,758 --> 00:33:27,200
Forget it, Shawn. I'm gonna sit
down with her for 30 minutes,

764
00:33:27,201 --> 00:33:30,501
ask a few questions and
keep it cool, just in case.

765
00:33:31,508 --> 00:33:33,134
Just in case she
didn't kill the guy.

766
00:33:33,135 --> 00:33:35,200
All right, here's
a compromise.

767
00:33:35,201 --> 00:33:36,505
Let me follow you.
No.

768
00:33:36,506 --> 00:33:39,309
Come on! From a safe distance.
It'll be like, 30 yards.

769
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,544
Consider me stealth, Shawn.

770
00:33:43,387 --> 00:33:45,048
Hey, be careful.

771
00:33:47,457 --> 00:33:49,687
You know, we have
a mirror in the bathroom.

772
00:33:50,627 --> 00:33:52,594
You seem jumpy.

773
00:33:52,595 --> 00:33:56,029
Me? Oh, no.
No, no. I'm excited.

774
00:33:57,634 --> 00:33:59,033
So...

775
00:33:59,536 --> 00:34:01,503
Tell me about this guy
you just broke up with.

776
00:34:01,504 --> 00:34:03,834
Exes? Ooh!

777
00:34:03,835 --> 00:34:07,035
Don't you know the number
one rule of first dates, Gus?

778
00:34:07,277 --> 00:34:10,303
I'm very comfortable
talking about anything.

779
00:34:10,514 --> 00:34:12,242
Well, there's not
much to tell, really.

780
00:34:12,243 --> 00:34:13,338
Mmm-hmm.

781
00:34:13,339 --> 00:34:15,111
About a month in,
I find out he's married.

782
00:34:15,112 --> 00:34:16,208
Right.

783
00:34:16,209 --> 00:34:17,445
Just my luck.

784
00:34:17,446 --> 00:34:19,178
And then he kept calling.

785
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:22,019
He actually thought I'd be okay
with the whole dirty scenario.

786
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,492
He just... He wasn't the guy I
thought he was, in a lot of ways.

787
00:34:26,926 --> 00:34:28,964
Wow, that's...
That's great.

788
00:34:28,965 --> 00:34:30,294
Why?

789
00:34:31,234 --> 00:34:32,701
I don't know.

790
00:34:35,472 --> 00:34:37,462
Hey, I'm sorry about
having to go earlier.

791
00:34:37,463 --> 00:34:39,599
It's just everything
changed at the observatory

792
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,575
and I gotta get to work
early tomorrow, so...

793
00:34:41,576 --> 00:34:42,633
What's going on?

794
00:34:42,634 --> 00:34:45,180
Well, don't tell
anyone, but

795
00:34:45,916 --> 00:34:49,351
Hugo and Bryant may
have discovered a planet.

796
00:34:49,352 --> 00:34:50,976
Get out of here!
Yeah!

797
00:34:50,977 --> 00:34:53,284
An extra-solar planet.

798
00:34:53,557 --> 00:34:55,080
About six months ago, I think.

799
00:34:55,081 --> 00:34:56,818
Bryant kinda clued me in
the night they found it.

800
00:34:56,819 --> 00:34:58,484
He was so excited.

801
00:34:58,485 --> 00:35:01,223
They had to track their data, wait
for the planet to come around again

802
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,286
and complete its orbit.
Right.

803
00:35:02,287 --> 00:35:04,059
So, it must be verified now.

804
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,567
I mean, you don't just call a press
conference for nothing, right?

805
00:35:06,568 --> 00:35:08,694
Hugo is over the moon.

806
00:35:08,695 --> 00:35:11,002
Yeah, he's gonna
be famous forever.

807
00:35:12,375 --> 00:35:15,810
Do you have any idea how huge
this is for someone's career?

808
00:35:15,811 --> 00:35:18,074
Um...
Of course he does.

809
00:35:18,381 --> 00:35:20,644
Shawn? I was in stealth
mode! How did you find me?

810
00:35:20,645 --> 00:35:22,081
You knew he was
following you?

811
00:35:22,082 --> 00:35:23,175
No, not at all.

812
00:35:23,176 --> 00:35:24,446
Jessica, this is
a good thing.

813
00:35:24,447 --> 00:35:26,215
It means we don't
suspect you anymore.

814
00:35:26,216 --> 00:35:28,256
"We"? Suspect me of what?

815
00:35:28,257 --> 00:35:29,882
I didn't think you killed
him, Jessica. Killed?

816
00:35:29,883 --> 00:35:31,824
And I hope this doesn't create
trust issues for our future.

817
00:35:31,825 --> 00:35:33,191
We just needed to
establish motive.

818
00:35:33,192 --> 00:35:35,127
Dude, we totally
established motive!

819
00:35:35,128 --> 00:35:38,098
Well, congratulations,
Gus, whatever you are.

820
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:41,864
You've got your motive, whatever that
is, but you no longer have a date.

821
00:35:41,865 --> 00:35:43,530
- No.
- Jessie!

822
00:35:47,377 --> 00:35:49,038
Jessica, hold on a sec!

823
00:35:49,779 --> 00:35:50,973
Gus!

824
00:35:52,449 --> 00:35:54,144
Man, that's twice!

825
00:36:00,857 --> 00:36:03,290
...and to the Santa Barbara
Space Center

826
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:05,259
for the use of
their facility.

827
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:09,093
I dedicate this to my departed
comrade, Bryant Vallery.

828
00:36:09,094 --> 00:36:10,255
Professor! Professor!

829
00:36:10,256 --> 00:36:11,629
When was the discovery made?

830
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,430
The 21st of June,

831
00:36:13,737 --> 00:36:18,196
9:55 p.m., during a routine changeover
between my partner and myself.

832
00:36:18,197 --> 00:36:20,139
While readjusting
some coordinates,

833
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:25,113
I inadvertently made what is certainly
the discovery of my lifetime.

834
00:36:25,315 --> 00:36:27,748
Which one of you
made the actual discovery?

835
00:36:27,749 --> 00:36:30,307
It was me. We traded off
chairs every two hours.

836
00:36:30,308 --> 00:36:31,444
This was completely
by accident.

837
00:36:31,445 --> 00:36:34,353
What about a book? Surely
you'll have a lot of book offers.

838
00:36:34,354 --> 00:36:35,515
Gus, you
know what this means?

839
00:36:35,516 --> 00:36:37,389
It's murder.
It's...

840
00:36:37,961 --> 00:36:39,791
No, it's motive.

841
00:36:39,792 --> 00:36:41,157
That's what I said.

842
00:36:41,158 --> 00:36:42,492
No, you said,
"It's murder."

843
00:36:42,493 --> 00:36:44,362
It's the same thing. Motive,
murder, it's the same thing.

844
00:36:44,363 --> 00:36:45,695
No, motive is the
reason for doing it.

845
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,894
It's in the same
family, Shawn.

846
00:36:46,895 --> 00:36:48,266
- Shh! Shh!
- Now, this planet

847
00:36:48,267 --> 00:36:50,601
has everything required
for an Earth-like structure.

848
00:36:50,602 --> 00:36:53,767
It has proximity,
it has the right orbit,

849
00:36:53,768 --> 00:36:56,003
It has
its own energy source...

850
00:36:56,004 --> 00:36:57,544
You've got to change
that phone setting.

851
00:36:57,545 --> 00:36:59,342
Jeez. Hello.

852
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:01,645
Shawn, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

853
00:37:01,646 --> 00:37:04,278
Look, Dad, I can't talk to you about
your love life, okay? I can't do it.

854
00:37:04,487 --> 00:37:05,612
My love life?
You still on that?

855
00:37:05,613 --> 00:37:08,248
I'm talking about this
foxglove you left on my porch.

856
00:37:08,249 --> 00:37:09,348
Foxglove?

857
00:37:09,349 --> 00:37:12,121
Your little plant with the dirty
roots. It's all over my welcome mat.

858
00:37:12,122 --> 00:37:14,287
That was foxglove?
What the hell is foxglove?

859
00:37:14,288 --> 00:37:16,058
<i>Some neighbor's cat
could have wandered in,</i>

860
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:18,565
chewed on it and croaked
right in my front yard, Shawn.

861
00:37:18,566 --> 00:37:21,262
Some foxglove has a chemical
called digitalis in its leaves.

862
00:37:21,263 --> 00:37:22,964
What, is it, like, poison?
It's a medicine!

863
00:37:22,965 --> 00:37:25,472
And you know how I feel
about dead things in my yard.

864
00:37:25,473 --> 00:37:26,701
Look, Dad,
I'm sorry. I gotta go,

865
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,640
I can't have two people
solving my case at once.

866
00:37:28,641 --> 00:37:30,542
Shawn, we should talk.
Okay, fine.

867
00:37:30,543 --> 00:37:32,376
I'll be at Tom Blair's Pub
on Friday. Come by.

868
00:37:32,377 --> 00:37:34,939
I got a date on Friday.
Can you do Saturday?

869
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,246
Never mind.

870
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,348
Digitalis is prescribed
for heart conditions.

871
00:37:38,349 --> 00:37:39,580
I don't see how
that helps us, Gus.

872
00:37:39,581 --> 00:37:42,089
It can cause toxicity in someone
who doesn't have a heart problem.

873
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:43,249
Wouldn't that show up
in the autopsy?

874
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:45,555
That's the problem. You have to
test for digitalis specifically.

875
00:37:45,556 --> 00:37:48,222
No one would consider it if someone
doesn't have a history of heart problems.

876
00:37:48,223 --> 00:37:49,287
Shh!

877
00:37:51,067 --> 00:37:52,124
Hey, what are
you doing here?

878
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:54,328
We just got our motive
for murder, Spencer.

879
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:57,702
Hugo found out that Vallery was gonna take
all the credit for their discovery himself.

880
00:37:57,703 --> 00:37:59,536
Cut him out of it entirely.

881
00:37:59,537 --> 00:38:01,974
Because he was on the scope
when they made the find?

882
00:38:01,975 --> 00:38:03,740
Yes. Maybe.

883
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:05,269
What are you doing here?

884
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,439
Well, we heard
you had the motive,

885
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,312
so we rushed down here
to volunteer our services.

886
00:38:08,313 --> 00:38:09,908
Thanks, but I'll take
this one myself.

887
00:38:09,909 --> 00:38:12,112
Okay, well at least
tell me about the poison.

888
00:38:12,113 --> 00:38:14,212
What poison? I didn't
say anything about poison.

889
00:38:14,213 --> 00:38:15,621
You most certainly did.
I heard it.

890
00:38:15,622 --> 00:38:17,852
Clear as day.
Must have slipped out.

891
00:38:17,853 --> 00:38:21,157
I have been thinking about poison as
a method, but I can't figure out how.

892
00:38:21,158 --> 00:38:23,596
Would you like me to
read your innermost thoughts?

893
00:38:23,597 --> 00:38:25,897
Like deep, deep, deep ones.

894
00:38:27,671 --> 00:38:28,967
Knock yourself out.

895
00:38:28,968 --> 00:38:31,370
Okay, I just
want you to relax.

896
00:38:31,371 --> 00:38:33,102
Breathe normally.
Close your eyes.

897
00:38:36,308 --> 00:38:38,471
Can you feel it? Can... Can...

898
00:38:41,718 --> 00:38:43,582
You want to check
the house, Hugo's house.

899
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:45,586
I am in the process
of getting a warrant.

900
00:38:45,587 --> 00:38:46,712
What did he say?

901
00:38:46,713 --> 00:38:48,757
He's in the process
of getting a warrant now.

902
00:38:48,758 --> 00:38:50,553
The garden, check the garden.

903
00:38:50,554 --> 00:38:51,650
It's buried there?

904
00:38:51,651 --> 00:38:53,252
Something's growing.

905
00:38:53,763 --> 00:38:56,663
Oh, I'm getting something.
I'm getting... I'm getting...

906
00:38:56,664 --> 00:38:58,824
Oh, oh, oh... Prince!

907
00:38:59,035 --> 00:39:00,127
No.

908
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,194
The artist formerly
known as Prince.

909
00:39:03,261 --> 00:39:04,465
Shawn! Wrong again.

910
00:39:04,466 --> 00:39:09,672
It's Prince after he was known as
"the artist formerly known as Prince."

911
00:39:10,113 --> 00:39:11,306
It's purple.
Yes!

912
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,280
Yes! That's it!
You're amazing.

913
00:39:13,281 --> 00:39:16,376
Oh, the caverns of
knowledge in that thing.

914
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,447
Here's the problem.
We ran the toxicology report.

915
00:39:19,448 --> 00:39:20,920
There's no trace of poisoning.

916
00:39:20,921 --> 00:39:23,514
Of course.
Thank you, Detective.

917
00:39:23,515 --> 00:39:27,790
So what you're saying is, he would've
had to administer it very, very slowly.

918
00:39:27,791 --> 00:39:30,355
Yes. That's exactly
what I'm saying.

919
00:39:31,868 --> 00:39:33,563
How do you poison
someone slowly?

920
00:39:35,572 --> 00:39:38,369
<i>He brings me coffee. Although,
he brings it for everybody.</i>

921
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:41,205
<i>All four of us. Three of us.</i>

922
00:39:42,245 --> 00:39:43,871
Coffee.
No, I'm good.

923
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,072
Tea.
Well, if you're going.

924
00:39:45,073 --> 00:39:47,638
It had to be the tea. The leaves
wouldn't stand out in the tea.

925
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:48,705
Hugo poisoned his tea.

926
00:39:48,706 --> 00:39:50,251
Every day for six months.

927
00:39:50,252 --> 00:39:52,184
Digitalis would cause
arrhythmia in a healthy heart.

928
00:39:52,185 --> 00:39:54,222
Which would disappear
as soon as someone died.

929
00:39:54,223 --> 00:39:55,483
- Solved it!
- No, you didn't.

930
00:39:55,484 --> 00:39:57,354
Yes, I did. Yes, I did.
No, you didn't.

931
00:39:57,355 --> 00:39:59,417
Oh, that's right.
You did.

932
00:39:59,418 --> 00:40:03,830
O'Hara, call the Coroner. Tell him to check
for even the slightest traces of digitalis.

933
00:40:05,502 --> 00:40:07,970
And get me a new
pair of handcuffs.

934
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:15,368
I've gotta be off.

935
00:40:23,286 --> 00:40:24,651
Hi. Thank you.

936
00:40:25,588 --> 00:40:26,577
Thanks.

937
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:29,053
Just part of the job.

938
00:40:29,392 --> 00:40:32,293
Spencer, a moment
of your precious time.

939
00:40:34,864 --> 00:40:36,558
Are you sure
we should be in here?

940
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,123
That night in the bar,

941
00:40:38,735 --> 00:40:40,998
I mentioned
my wife, didn't I?

942
00:40:40,999 --> 00:40:42,934
Yes.
Oh, crap.

943
00:40:43,306 --> 00:40:44,602
What did I say, exactly?

944
00:40:44,603 --> 00:40:45,799
That she wants you back.

945
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,671
No, no, I don't
think I said that.

946
00:40:47,672 --> 00:40:48,869
Maybe I sensed that.

947
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:52,005
You didn't sense it either,
but thanks for trying to help.

948
00:40:53,082 --> 00:40:56,643
To tell you the truth, I think
I got some help on this case.

949
00:40:57,754 --> 00:40:59,381
Really?
Yeah.

950
00:40:59,756 --> 00:41:01,552
Well, hey, man, we all
get help sometimes, right?

951
00:41:01,553 --> 00:41:04,353
It's the truly great ones
that know how to accept it.

952
00:41:04,354 --> 00:41:08,123
And if I may add one
more thing, Detective,

953
00:41:08,124 --> 00:41:09,925
you astound me.

954
00:41:10,233 --> 00:41:11,392
Second half to that joke?

955
00:41:11,393 --> 00:41:13,094
No.
No?

956
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,897
The press is asking
for you outside.

957
00:41:14,898 --> 00:41:17,337
Tell them I will
be right there.

958
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:22,340
To tell you the truth, Spencer,
sometimes I astound myself.

959
00:41:22,341 --> 00:41:23,537
How's the knot?
Tight.

960
00:41:23,538 --> 00:41:24,807
Great.

961
00:41:39,362 --> 00:41:40,658
All alone, huh?

962
00:41:40,659 --> 00:41:42,754
That would appear
to be the case.

963
00:41:42,755 --> 00:41:45,062
It's a Friday night.
What happened to Sylvia?

964
00:41:46,302 --> 00:41:49,499
Would you believe that I didn't
want to hurt your feelings?

965
00:41:51,808 --> 00:41:53,833
Sit down. Have a drink.

966
00:42:01,184 --> 00:42:02,446
You buying?

967
00:42:04,087 --> 00:42:05,384
You kidding?

968
00:42:14,831 --> 00:42:18,391
<i>In between the lines
there's a lot of obscurity</i>

969
00:42:18,392 --> 00:42:21,867
<i>I'm not inclined
to resign to maturity</i>

970
00:42:21,868 --> 00:42:25,270
<i>If it's all right
then you're all wrong</i>

971
00:42:25,271 --> 00:42:28,866
<i>But why bounce around
to the same damn song?</i>

972
00:42:29,946 --> 00:42:33,905
<i>You'd rather run
when you can't crawl</i>

973
00:42:36,185 --> 00:42:39,813
<i>I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth</i>

974
00:42:39,814 --> 00:42:43,119
<i>I know, you know
They just don't have any proof</i>

975
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,183
<i>Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend</i>

976
00:42:46,184 --> 00:42:50,197
<i>Your worst inhibitions tend
to psych you out in the end</i>

977
00:42:50,198 --> 00:42:52,392
<i>I know, you know</i>

978
00:42:53,736 --> 00:42:55,465
<i>I know, you know</i>
