1
00:00:02,301 --> 00:00:04,632
"For every action, there is an
opposite and equal reaction."

2
00:00:04,633 --> 00:00:07,534
Who? Isaac Newton,
third law of motion.

3
00:00:07,535 --> 00:00:12,065
And how does that apply to the
nature of man? Anyone? Shawn.

4
00:00:12,066 --> 00:00:13,838
You push, they push back.

5
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:15,004
Correct. Why?

6
00:00:15,005 --> 00:00:17,104
Because man is
a stupid creature

7
00:00:17,105 --> 00:00:19,151
who'd rather fight
than use his brain.

8
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:21,543
And what idiot said that?

9
00:00:22,721 --> 00:00:23,847
You did.

10
00:00:25,424 --> 00:00:28,358
The name of the game
is survival, sports fans.

11
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:30,121
In order to survive,
you've got to fight.

12
00:00:30,122 --> 00:00:32,060
And if you fight,
you better damn well win.

13
00:00:32,061 --> 00:00:36,829
Because if you don't win, and you don't
use your brain, then what happens? Gus?

14
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:37,925
You lose?

15
00:00:37,926 --> 00:00:41,494
<i>And for this troop, that
is not an option. Comprende?</i>

16
00:00:41,495 --> 00:00:42,562
Sir, yes, sir!

17
00:00:42,563 --> 00:00:47,942
Because losing is for lowlifes.
Losing is for quitters.

18
00:00:47,943 --> 00:00:50,945
Are you boys lowlifes?
Are you boys quitters?

19
00:00:50,946 --> 00:00:52,312
Sir, no, sir!

20
00:00:52,313 --> 00:00:54,477
Troop 101, ten-hut!

21
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:58,648
Gentlemen,
we are about to embark on

22
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:02,022
the Junior Bobcat Manual's
infamous Exercise Number 32,

23
00:01:02,023 --> 00:01:04,619
the launching
of a solid fuel rocket.

24
00:01:05,097 --> 00:01:08,190
Now, one of you lucky grunts
is gonna nab this thing

25
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:10,360
and you're gonna
haul ass back to me.

26
00:01:10,803 --> 00:01:13,101
The prize?
A hot fudge sundae.

27
00:01:13,572 --> 00:01:17,063
But if you lose? What
does the loser get, Shawn?

28
00:01:17,064 --> 00:01:18,608
He gets to
look on with envy.

29
00:01:18,609 --> 00:01:21,703
That is correct.
He gets to look on with envy.

30
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,217
Because that, gentlemen,
is the American way.

31
00:01:27,386 --> 00:01:28,876
On your marks.

32
00:01:32,024 --> 00:01:33,218
Ready.

33
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,652
Set.

34
00:01:40,032 --> 00:01:41,056
Go!

35
00:02:02,454 --> 00:02:03,477
What's this?

36
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:04,715
A parachute.

37
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,316
I sent you after a rocket.

38
00:02:07,626 --> 00:02:10,459
Shawn?
Where's my rocket?

39
00:02:11,263 --> 00:02:13,026
I thought he had it.

40
00:02:25,577 --> 00:02:27,909
A shortcut!
You took a shortcut!

41
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:30,780
A shortcut, huh?

42
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:34,115
Prove it.

43
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:38,416
I'll tell you what,
I beat you this time,

44
00:02:39,892 --> 00:02:41,655
I'm eating the sundae.

45
00:02:50,903 --> 00:02:52,164
Ooh, just in time.

46
00:02:52,165 --> 00:02:53,261
For what?

47
00:02:53,472 --> 00:02:56,406
The annual Civil War
re-enactors meltdown.

48
00:02:56,407 --> 00:02:57,839
The event isn't
until next weekend.

49
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,500
Yeah, but this is the
best part, the rehearsal.

50
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:00,976
This is what
they should charge for.

51
00:03:00,977 --> 00:03:02,741
Form battle lines!

52
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,774
Prepare muskets!

53
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:07,647
Is that Lassiter?
Yes, it is.

54
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,051
What died on his face?

55
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,586
Charge!

56
00:03:34,813 --> 00:03:37,111
Stop, stop, stop!
Stop!

57
00:03:40,085 --> 00:03:43,212
Okay, guys,
that was better.

58
00:03:43,213 --> 00:03:45,620
Really.
It was good, actually.

59
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:48,985
Okay, it wasn't good.

60
00:03:48,986 --> 00:03:50,790
Look, guys,

61
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:55,256
I know I promised last week that I
wasn't going to give any more notes.

62
00:03:55,257 --> 00:03:59,202
But, guys, come on,
that last charge, it was...

63
00:03:59,671 --> 00:04:00,831
How do I say this?

64
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,797
It was a
soul-sucking embarrassment

65
00:04:02,798 --> 00:04:04,706
that made me ashamed
to wear the uniform.

66
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:08,005
Luke Bauer?
Where's Luke?

67
00:04:08,313 --> 00:04:09,712
Colonel Lassiter, sir!

68
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:14,785
Luke, what did I say
about the bayonet gag, huh?

69
00:04:15,554 --> 00:04:19,011
Too much. There's gonna be
kids watching this, all right?

70
00:04:19,012 --> 00:04:21,651
We don't want the people
in the grandstands to vomit.

71
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:26,524
Okay, I know we haven't
reenacted this one for a while.

72
00:04:27,132 --> 00:04:30,897
<i>But the battle at
Piper's Cove, Kentucky, 1864,</i>

73
00:04:30,898 --> 00:04:32,265
is special to me.

74
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:35,965
It ended Confederate Quantrill's
plot to assassinate Lincoln.

75
00:04:35,966 --> 00:04:39,806
And it involved my great-great-grandfather,
Colonel Muscum T. Lassiter...

76
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,866
Muscum?

77
00:04:40,867 --> 00:04:42,378
What the hell is a Muscum?

78
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:44,279
It was a very common name
of the era.

79
00:04:46,118 --> 00:04:47,106
<i>History Channel.</i>

80
00:04:47,107 --> 00:04:51,122
ESPN, Gus. Channel 206.
I'm begging you.

81
00:04:52,224 --> 00:04:53,850
Hey, Jules!
Wanna join?

82
00:04:53,851 --> 00:04:54,949
Oh, can I?

83
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,254
I don't know. Do you
have your own hoopskirt?

84
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:57,693
I rent one.

85
00:04:58,263 --> 00:05:00,128
Sally Reynolds,
front and center.

86
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:03,566
You missed your cue, Sally.

87
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:05,864
The cannon fired,
yet no Sally.

88
00:05:05,865 --> 00:05:07,871
I got stuck
in the hospital tent.

89
00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:10,373
Sergeant Menish had a quick question
about his homeowner's policy.

90
00:05:10,374 --> 00:05:14,002
How touching. However, today you are
not here to sell insurance, Sally.

91
00:05:14,003 --> 00:05:16,442
Today you are here to
help me win the Civil War.

92
00:05:16,443 --> 00:05:17,640
And according to
our battle plan,

93
00:05:17,641 --> 00:05:20,411
when the fifth cannon fires
you exit the hospital tent

94
00:05:20,412 --> 00:05:22,476
and you shoot Captain
Quantrill off his horse.

95
00:05:22,477 --> 00:05:23,918
There's no need to get nasty.

96
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,287
I agree.
It was totally out of line.

97
00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:29,994
Sorry, I didn't think
you could hear that!

98
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:35,197
Sally, sweet Sally.

99
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:40,463
If you do not point your
gun at Captain Quantrill

100
00:05:40,464 --> 00:05:43,133
and fire at
the prescribed moment,

101
00:05:43,575 --> 00:05:47,203
the audience will not be able to make
heads nor tails of what we are doing.

102
00:05:47,204 --> 00:05:51,271
And it will appear as if
the evil Captain Quantrill,

103
00:05:51,272 --> 00:05:55,752
now being portrayed by our
horrifyingly method-acting Nelson Poe

104
00:05:55,753 --> 00:05:58,915
who happened to roll
way off his mark, by the way,

105
00:05:59,591 --> 00:06:00,818
fell off his horse

106
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:03,987
and is lying here
for no apparent reason at all.

107
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,555
Get up, Nelson.

108
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,426
Nelson, I swear to God, if you're
sleeping through rehearsal again...

109
00:06:11,427 --> 00:06:12,902
I said get up!

110
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:26,339
Okay, either that guy is
a phenomenal actor

111
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:28,913
or he's dead.

112
00:06:35,627 --> 00:06:39,255
<i>I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth</i>

113
00:06:39,256 --> 00:06:42,527
<i>I know, you know
They just don't have any proof</i>

114
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:45,626
<i>Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend</i>

115
00:06:45,627 --> 00:06:50,141
<i>Your worst inhibitions tend
to psych you out in the end</i>

116
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,480
Oh, come on, let
me in on this. No.

117
00:07:03,481 --> 00:07:06,250
I was there. Inexplicably
drawn to the scene.

118
00:07:06,251 --> 00:07:07,848
I was meant to
solve this case.

119
00:07:07,849 --> 00:07:09,324
It's sort of
like a miracle.

120
00:07:09,325 --> 00:07:11,691
You have been out there every
weekend we've rehearsed.

121
00:07:11,692 --> 00:07:12,888
And don't think
I didn't see you

122
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:14,829
trying to throw M&Ms in the
injured soldiers' mouths.

123
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,662
Okay, first of all,
those were Skittles,

124
00:07:16,663 --> 00:07:18,133
and they have
a rainbow of flavors.

125
00:07:18,134 --> 00:07:20,728
The answer is still no.
Beat it.

126
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:34,140
Oh! Hold it!
I'm suddenly seeing Nelson.

127
00:07:34,141 --> 00:07:36,152
The bullet,
traveling through the air,

128
00:07:36,153 --> 00:07:38,552
tearing, ripping, pain...

129
00:07:38,553 --> 00:07:40,819
The bullet went
straight through his heart.

130
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:43,617
This was not
an accident, Detective!

131
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:46,763
I don't know how you know that,
and I don't give a rat's ass.

132
00:07:46,764 --> 00:07:48,823
This case is personal.

133
00:07:49,301 --> 00:07:51,564
One of my soldiers was
killed on my watch.

134
00:07:51,565 --> 00:07:54,299
And I, not you,
am going to clean it up.

135
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:56,298
We clear?

136
00:07:56,299 --> 00:07:58,842
I wouldn't have gone with something
as traditional as "we clear?"

137
00:07:58,843 --> 00:08:02,606
<i>You could've gone foreign,
right? Comprende? Capisc?</i>

138
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:06,674
Could have had a little fun with
it. You dig my gist, sweetpants?

139
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,886
These are just suggestions.

140
00:08:09,887 --> 00:08:12,582
...and to you, the Central
Reenactment Committee,

141
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,626
I say as of today, the event
next weekend is still on,

142
00:08:15,627 --> 00:08:17,217
pending an investigation.

143
00:08:17,218 --> 00:08:18,922
Now, most of you are cops.

144
00:08:18,923 --> 00:08:23,262
Should we find any evidence that this was
not an accident and do not make an arrest,

145
00:08:23,263 --> 00:08:25,860
we will re-evaluate
at that time.

146
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,500
Now that said,
Detective Lassiter,

147
00:08:28,501 --> 00:08:31,906
I want to know how, I want to
know who, I want to know why.

148
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:34,768
Oh, it...

149
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:38,043
It's kind of hard to get off. It
takes a long time to unstick the glue.

150
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:42,384
All right.

151
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,689
- Ooh!
- Oh, yeah.

152
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,097
Thank you, Chief.

153
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:54,857
Pending the coroner's report,

154
00:08:54,858 --> 00:08:57,423
I'd have to say there are
no indications of foul play.

155
00:08:57,424 --> 00:09:02,269
The general consensus is that a live
round got mixed in with our blanks.

156
00:09:02,674 --> 00:09:06,040
Mr. Mahoney is the regiment's
munitions expert and jeweler,

157
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:09,204
one of Santa Barbara's
finest. He can expand on this.

158
00:09:09,205 --> 00:09:10,611
Mr. Mahoney.

159
00:09:10,612 --> 00:09:13,673
As you know, Detective, we
had live-round target practice

160
00:09:13,674 --> 00:09:14,809
this past weekend.

161
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,115
Along with you,
we assumed a musket ball

162
00:09:17,116 --> 00:09:19,019
got stuck
in one of our rifles,

163
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,318
laid there unseen,

164
00:09:20,319 --> 00:09:24,624
and then a blank was inserted
during the last rehearsal...

165
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:29,098
Poor Nelson. A terrible,
terrible, tragic accident.

166
00:09:30,702 --> 00:09:33,033
The battles meant
so much to him.

167
00:09:33,034 --> 00:09:36,302
Anyway, this is an official
police investigation.

168
00:09:36,608 --> 00:09:39,770
So let's focus on our schematic
and nail down the specifics.

169
00:09:39,771 --> 00:09:41,243
Detective O'Hara,
please.

170
00:09:41,244 --> 00:09:42,302
Hey.

171
00:09:43,348 --> 00:09:45,543
What's the deal, why do
you keep staring at me?

172
00:09:47,018 --> 00:09:48,780
One. It's our understanding

173
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:50,683
that the victim was shot
off his horse

174
00:09:50,684 --> 00:09:52,189
at the top of
the creek bank here...

175
00:09:53,925 --> 00:09:54,949
And then rolled

176
00:09:56,294 --> 00:09:57,761
to the creek bed here.

177
00:09:57,963 --> 00:09:59,725
Two. We know Nelson
was facing west,

178
00:09:59,726 --> 00:10:01,162
so we're gonna
focus our attentions here

179
00:10:01,163 --> 00:10:03,394
on the opposite bank where
we assume the shot originated.

180
00:10:04,836 --> 00:10:05,894
Assume.

181
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:09,065
Detective?
Spencer?

182
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:13,100
What about three,
the missing bullet?

183
00:10:13,578 --> 00:10:17,138
I saw it ripping
through Nelson's body,

184
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:19,182
in through the front,
out through the back.

185
00:10:19,183 --> 00:10:21,515
And it still
hasn't been found.

186
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:24,113
Wait.
How do you know all that?

187
00:10:24,114 --> 00:10:26,281
Lassy,
you wanna take this one?

188
00:10:26,282 --> 00:10:28,848
He had an "episode"
in the hallway.

189
00:10:28,849 --> 00:10:31,395
Look,
I can handle this myself.

190
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,961
Nelson, Nelson, you're going to
have to speak up. You're teeny!

191
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:39,800
You were shot
through the heart?

192
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:41,966
Now, that was
privileged information!

193
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:43,097
I didn't say anything.

194
00:10:43,098 --> 00:10:45,234
Are you sure about this?

195
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,507
It's bold,
but I'll run with it.

196
00:10:51,082 --> 00:10:54,813
He says people don't get shot
through the heart by accident.

197
00:10:57,122 --> 00:10:59,090
He says he was murdered.

198
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:01,383
You're hired.

199
00:11:04,729 --> 00:11:05,717
You told them what?

200
00:11:05,718 --> 00:11:08,128
Gus, she was hot, and she
was dressed as a nurse.

201
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:09,497
You know
how I feel about that.

202
00:11:10,068 --> 00:11:12,127
Oh, come on, what was I
supposed to do, not impress her?

203
00:11:13,104 --> 00:11:15,367
Plus, the tiny figurine made
a very convincing argument.

204
00:11:15,368 --> 00:11:17,805
I don't know how you're gonna prove
murder with two lousy bullet holes.

205
00:11:17,806 --> 00:11:21,812
Oh, relax. I did some checking
on Nelson Poe, nobody liked him.

206
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:24,947
Ever.
And second of all...

207
00:11:24,948 --> 00:11:26,142
What?

208
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:29,415
Dude, I don't have
a second of all.

209
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:32,923
And we know Nelson was on top of
the ridge, facing the Union soldiers

210
00:11:32,924 --> 00:11:35,185
over here when he was shot.
So Schwartz, take Team A,

211
00:11:35,186 --> 00:11:36,283
check out that high grass.

212
00:11:36,284 --> 00:11:39,057
O'Hara, take Team B,
start going over the ridge.

213
00:11:42,767 --> 00:11:43,755
Do it.

214
00:11:43,756 --> 00:11:44,891
Yes, sir.

215
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,304
Find something amusing?

216
00:11:50,305 --> 00:11:52,934
Mildly amusing.
More odd.

217
00:11:52,935 --> 00:11:55,502
Delightful,
in a queer sort of way.

218
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,973
For your edification, the
reenactment of the battles...

219
00:11:57,974 --> 00:11:59,141
Edification?

220
00:11:59,584 --> 00:12:00,845
Yeah, edification.

221
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:04,513
Is that legal? Like, in public.
Public edification's legal?

222
00:12:04,514 --> 00:12:05,816
It means
for your information...

223
00:12:05,817 --> 00:12:07,380
Why didn't you
just say that?

224
00:12:07,381 --> 00:12:10,450
For your edification,
the reenactment of battles,

225
00:12:10,451 --> 00:12:13,520
battles fought by our forefathers
to preserve this Union,

226
00:12:13,521 --> 00:12:15,259
is a sacred trust.

227
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,132
What are you guys
doing here, anyway?

228
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:18,429
I'm a bit of
a Civil War buff.

229
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,935
I'm reading the dirt.

230
00:12:19,936 --> 00:12:21,835
The trees.
The hot dog stand.

231
00:12:21,836 --> 00:12:24,272
No real information there,
but they do great sauerkraut.

232
00:12:24,273 --> 00:12:26,502
I may even be able to
help you name a suspect.

233
00:12:26,503 --> 00:12:29,808
Look, I told you, we're 95% sure
this was an accidental shooting.

234
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:31,347
What about the other 5%?

235
00:12:31,348 --> 00:12:33,610
If I am wrong, we will
hold a press conference,

236
00:12:33,611 --> 00:12:36,586
you two will be cordially
invited to say "I told you so."

237
00:12:37,355 --> 00:12:41,724
Seems fair. Hey...
Can I wear your face wig?

238
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,559
What are you doing?

239
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,125
Shockingly,
Lassiter is holding out on us.

240
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,065
I do not think that he thinks
that this was an accident.

241
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,433
What do you mean?

242
00:12:56,434 --> 00:12:59,271
I saw three names checked off
the roster on his clipboard.

243
00:12:59,272 --> 00:13:00,537
What names?

244
00:13:00,538 --> 00:13:02,910
Gus,
I thought you'd never ask.

245
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:33,308
What is this?
The battlefield.

246
00:13:34,312 --> 00:13:36,802
Based on what? The briefing
room board at the police station.

247
00:13:36,803 --> 00:13:38,575
You did this from memory?
Yes.

248
00:13:38,576 --> 00:13:40,377
You said you saw it
for two minutes.

249
00:13:40,378 --> 00:13:42,386
Right, two whole minutes.

250
00:13:43,021 --> 00:13:44,009
You got problems.

251
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:47,581
Factoid! The musket is
accurate from 30 yards.

252
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:53,123
Poe.

253
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:55,621
G.C.

254
00:13:55,622 --> 00:13:56,689
G. C?

255
00:14:00,305 --> 00:14:01,396
George Cheslow.

256
00:14:01,397 --> 00:14:03,667
George Cheslow?
From sixth grade?

257
00:14:03,668 --> 00:14:04,730
Little Georgie!

258
00:14:04,731 --> 00:14:06,436
He's, like, a dentist now.

259
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:08,776
Really?

260
00:14:09,948 --> 00:14:11,176
See you in six months.

261
00:14:13,218 --> 00:14:14,377
We go in,
we check it out.

262
00:14:14,378 --> 00:14:16,750
See if George Cheslow had
any reason to murder somebody.

263
00:14:17,322 --> 00:14:18,583
Pop out.

264
00:14:18,584 --> 00:14:21,181
Mr. Guster.
The dentist will see you now.

265
00:14:21,182 --> 00:14:22,748
Sweet.
Whoa!

266
00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:26,262
Me? My teeth are gorgeous. You
said the appointment was for you.

267
00:14:26,263 --> 00:14:28,298
Right. For me to
do some snooping.

268
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:30,731
Because I'm a much better
snooper than you are.

269
00:14:30,732 --> 00:14:31,825
You just keep him occupied.

270
00:14:31,826 --> 00:14:33,165
Occupied how?

271
00:14:37,642 --> 00:14:39,166
Gus, stop it. Be a man.

272
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,544
What's he saying? He says
his teeth are gorgeous.

273
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,979
I'm sorry, Shawn, but the reason
you have to be here, too, is?

274
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,185
George, Gus has phobias. And being
alone in a dentist chair is one.

275
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:55,651
He could snap at any moment.

276
00:14:55,652 --> 00:14:57,125
This is actually
for your own protection.

277
00:14:57,126 --> 00:14:59,026
Last time
he bit off an index finger.

278
00:14:59,597 --> 00:15:03,055
Thankfully, I was there. They were
able to save everything but the nail.

279
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:08,636
<i>Oops. Pardonne-moi.</i>

280
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,572
Honey, can I talk
to you for a minute?

281
00:15:10,573 --> 00:15:12,769
Oh, sure.
Gentleman, duty calls.

282
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:25,185
Oh, and the credit card won't
go through. Do you have any cash?

283
00:15:25,186 --> 00:15:26,723
Oh, sure.

284
00:15:26,991 --> 00:15:29,687
I've got tennis,
then dinner with Karen.

285
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:37,796
Okay, I'll hit
an ATM, that's...

286
00:15:37,797 --> 00:15:38,994
Don't wait up if I'm late.

287
00:15:38,995 --> 00:15:41,903
Oh, okay. All right. Bye,
sweetie. Good shopping.

288
00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:46,268
Ah, yes.

289
00:15:47,011 --> 00:15:49,035
George, I heard you got
married, but, wow, huh?

290
00:15:49,036 --> 00:15:51,138
I know what you're thinking,
"What's wrong with this picture?"

291
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:52,512
But, you know,
where is it written

292
00:15:52,513 --> 00:15:55,052
that the ugly guy
never gets the girl?

293
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,078
Everywhere, man.
Yeah.

294
00:15:59,547 --> 00:16:04,584
No, we're fine. We're better,
you're fine. Don't worry about it.

295
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:06,428
Let's see here.

296
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:11,227
So how is married life
treating you these days, George?

297
00:16:11,228 --> 00:16:14,499
Everything...
Everything solid?

298
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:17,298
Why are you
snooping around here, Shawn?

299
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:20,639
You think I did this

300
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,804
because Erlene was
having an affair with Poe?

301
00:16:22,805 --> 00:16:24,906
Huh?
You didn't know.

302
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,247
Of course I knew, George.
I'm a psychic.

303
00:16:31,456 --> 00:16:33,320
It was over, completely over.

304
00:16:33,321 --> 00:16:35,950
I'm beyond it
and Erlene's beyond it.

305
00:16:35,951 --> 00:16:39,757
At least,
I think she is. I...

306
00:16:39,758 --> 00:16:41,454
I had some gauze...

307
00:16:41,455 --> 00:16:44,297
It's right...
If I could just...

308
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:48,398
Oh, there you go.
Thank you.

309
00:16:50,608 --> 00:16:54,441
George, do you wear your
glasses out on the battlefield?

310
00:16:54,442 --> 00:16:56,476
Oh, I want to,
but Lassiter won't let me.

311
00:16:56,477 --> 00:16:58,539
He says they're not
of the period.

312
00:17:00,385 --> 00:17:01,874
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

313
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,214
Gus here doesn't think
you did it.

314
00:17:03,215 --> 00:17:04,276
Neither does Shawn.

315
00:17:04,277 --> 00:17:08,120
Well, thanks, guys,
I appreciate that. Oops!

316
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:09,750
Oops?
Small cavity.

317
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:10,953
I don't have
any cavity in my mouth...

318
00:17:10,954 --> 00:17:12,189
It's right on the surface.
Don't worry about it.

319
00:17:13,355 --> 00:17:17,959
There we go.
There's my trooper.

320
00:17:19,003 --> 00:17:21,096
Listen, Georgie, nobody's
drilled my mouth for anything...

321
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:26,440
George?

322
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:28,969
Why am I surprised?

323
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,481
It is a funny coincidence.
Hey, Jules.

324
00:17:32,116 --> 00:17:33,844
George,
I hate to say this,

325
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:36,317
but you're under arrest
for the murder of Nelson Poe.

326
00:17:36,318 --> 00:17:38,444
What?
On what grounds?

327
00:17:38,445 --> 00:17:39,784
You said
it was an accident.

328
00:17:39,785 --> 00:17:41,984
We discovered a stack of
love letters at Nelson's house

329
00:17:41,985 --> 00:17:44,550
indicating he was having
an affair with your wife

330
00:17:44,551 --> 00:17:46,256
and that you had
threatened to kill him.

331
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:48,028
Oh, come on.

332
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:50,765
I am so disappointed in you.

333
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,973
All right.
Okay, okay, okay.

334
00:17:59,744 --> 00:18:01,109
You got the wrong man.

335
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:03,808
What did he say?

336
00:18:05,016 --> 00:18:06,881
You've got the wrong man.

337
00:18:10,555 --> 00:18:12,317
First, I told you so.

338
00:18:12,318 --> 00:18:15,756
Secondly, I think George
Cheslow is an innocent man.

339
00:18:15,757 --> 00:18:18,158
Yeah, you know, he's right.
We do have a paper-thin case.

340
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:20,753
I mean, all we've got is
motive, means and opportunity.

341
00:18:20,754 --> 00:18:23,426
Look, guys.
I had a dream last night.

342
00:18:23,935 --> 00:18:26,698
I was sipping iced wine
with a baby tree monkey.

343
00:18:26,699 --> 00:18:28,670
And I fell and I landed
in a wooded area.

344
00:18:28,671 --> 00:18:32,072
And that's where
I saw Nelson Poe get shot.

345
00:18:32,073 --> 00:18:36,580
Only, in my dream, the shooter was
much closer than I originally thought.

346
00:18:37,582 --> 00:18:39,947
This is a minie ball,
am I right?

347
00:18:39,948 --> 00:18:41,416
Where did you get this?
Your desk.

348
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:46,479
Now, it's common knowledge that minie balls
cause huge gaping holes in human flesh

349
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,649
which leads to
a quandary in my dream.

350
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:52,560
Why was Nelson Poe's
exit wound so small?

351
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:56,494
If George Cheslow had been
in that wooded area,

352
00:18:56,495 --> 00:19:00,024
he was way too far to make a shot
that caused such a little hole.

353
00:19:00,025 --> 00:19:03,197
Whoever shot Nelson was
much, much closer.

354
00:19:03,198 --> 00:19:06,640
And this "whoever" would be...

355
00:19:06,641 --> 00:19:07,972
Engelbert Humperdinck.

356
00:19:07,973 --> 00:19:09,273
So you've got nothing.

357
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:11,576
Thank you for the random
speculation. Goodbye.

358
00:19:11,577 --> 00:19:15,140
Mr. Spencer, if you can't name names,
I'm afraid he's right this time.

359
00:19:15,141 --> 00:19:17,312
Fine, I'll get you a name.

360
00:19:18,756 --> 00:19:20,951
And I'm gonna
get you a woman.

361
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:26,653
"Afraid he's right"?
"This time"?

362
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:33,103
It's a gift, actually, for
my son. A surprise of sorts.

363
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:38,371
This way he, my son, will be able
to keep track of time for a change.

364
00:19:38,372 --> 00:19:41,104
Kid was late at birth,
he's been late ever since.

365
00:19:41,105 --> 00:19:45,707
Now, he is going to have a gold
pocket watch just like mine.

366
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:48,048
I've had mine for 30 years.

367
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:51,885
I see. Now, the inscription.
What would you like it to say?

368
00:19:52,323 --> 00:19:53,790
"Shawn,

369
00:19:54,792 --> 00:19:57,555
"don't lose this watch,
Henry Spencer."

370
00:19:57,556 --> 00:19:59,118
Spencer.

371
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:02,790
What, too much?

372
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:07,463
No, no. It's just that your son is
no doubt familiar with your last name.

373
00:20:07,672 --> 00:20:10,197
It might contradict
the sentiment.

374
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:13,108
All right,
what would you suggest?

375
00:20:14,278 --> 00:20:16,610
"Love, Dad"?

376
00:20:16,981 --> 00:20:20,939
"Love, Dad." Well, why don't
you just put "Kissy, kissy"?

377
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,248
Right, too mushy.
No problem.

378
00:20:23,249 --> 00:20:25,584
So, before we go any further,
let's see.

379
00:20:25,585 --> 00:20:28,488
Vintage gold pocket watch.
Gold chain.

380
00:20:28,489 --> 00:20:32,518
Taxes and engraving,
comes to a total of...

381
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:35,863
Wait, wait, wait.

382
00:20:35,864 --> 00:20:39,766
Where's my discount? I'm
ex-cop. Half the regiment's cop.

383
00:20:39,767 --> 00:20:41,428
<i>I thought we agreed on $400.</i>

384
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:44,770
<i>Oh, yes, we did.
But at $4 per engraved letter,</i>

385
00:20:44,771 --> 00:20:47,776
that adds a total of $210.

386
00:20:47,777 --> 00:20:52,805
All right, take away "Shawn,"
"this watch", "Spencer."

387
00:20:53,618 --> 00:20:55,916
How much does
that come out to?

388
00:20:56,754 --> 00:21:00,018
$56 for the engraving
plus tax,

389
00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:01,489
<i>$460 even.</i>

390
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,356
And what does
the revised inscription read?

391
00:21:04,357 --> 00:21:06,624
"Don't lose, Henry."

392
00:21:07,932 --> 00:21:11,129
Clean, to the point.
I like it.

393
00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:13,492
Come in.

394
00:21:14,405 --> 00:21:16,668
Mr. Guster, I know you said you
didn't want to be interrupted,

395
00:21:16,669 --> 00:21:18,537
but there is a Lieutenant
Crunch here to see you.

396
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:19,802
Crunch?

397
00:21:19,803 --> 00:21:21,640
Actually, I've been promoted.

398
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,969
It's Captain Crunch.

399
00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:26,448
Thank you.

400
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,516
Not in a thousand years.

401
00:21:30,517 --> 00:21:32,851
Dude, we're joining that
regiment. No, we are not.

402
00:21:32,852 --> 00:21:35,187
They're down to 30 guys.
Please, I have a meeting in...

403
00:21:35,188 --> 00:21:36,725
And this mystery is
still wide open.

404
00:21:36,726 --> 00:21:39,887
Gus, think about it.
Camping out under the stars.

405
00:21:39,888 --> 00:21:45,458
Living history. Eating beans and
rotten meat with men who reek of valor.

406
00:21:45,459 --> 00:21:46,968
There's just one thing
you haven't considered

407
00:21:46,969 --> 00:21:49,062
in this perfect scenario
of yours, Shawn.

408
00:21:49,063 --> 00:21:50,470
That's not true.
I've considered everything.

409
00:21:50,471 --> 00:21:53,998
Really? And what role would I
play in this production of yours?

410
00:21:53,999 --> 00:21:55,305
I don't... What do you...

411
00:21:55,306 --> 00:21:56,868
What role would I play

412
00:21:56,869 --> 00:21:58,539
in the midst of
all those hardcore

413
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:01,710
down-to-the-last-detail
Civil War re-enactors?

414
00:22:02,153 --> 00:22:03,585
Would I be...
No.

415
00:22:03,586 --> 00:22:06,019
Gus, no.

416
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,116
Okay, then maybe would I be...
Never.

417
00:22:09,393 --> 00:22:11,485
Who are you talking to? You're
talking to me. This is me.

418
00:22:11,486 --> 00:22:13,461
Then what, Shawn?
What would I be?

419
00:22:13,462 --> 00:22:17,968
Because I tell you, there is no way,
no way, that I would ever, never ever...

420
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,868
May I please tell you
what I was thinking?

421
00:22:20,869 --> 00:22:22,030
What?

422
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,599
<i>I was thinking Glory.</i>

423
00:22:25,476 --> 00:22:27,740
I was thinking Denzel.

424
00:22:28,646 --> 00:22:31,877
Did you just say Denzel?
As in Denzel Washington?

425
00:22:32,283 --> 00:22:33,579
No, the other Denzel.

426
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,210
Of course. And we'll
put you on a horse,

427
00:22:36,211 --> 00:22:38,982
and we'll give you
your own sword.

428
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:40,647
You're gonna have
a chestful of medals.

429
00:22:40,648 --> 00:22:43,989
You can be anything you
want. You can be a pilot.

430
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:46,290
The Air Force wasn't
formed until World War I.

431
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:48,524
That's fair.
So you can't be a pilot.

432
00:22:48,525 --> 00:22:51,931
Look, I called Mr. Mahoney,
he's Mr. Uniform,

433
00:22:51,932 --> 00:22:55,302
and I told him to make you
something spectacular.

434
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:58,035
Denzel Washington.

435
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:07,749
<i>Captain Mahoney, you said
we needed recruits? Voilà.</i>

436
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:12,318
Welcome aboard, son. I didn't
expect you back so soon.

437
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:14,857
Don't know if
the uniforms are ready yet.

438
00:23:14,858 --> 00:23:16,756
But it is spectacular?

439
00:23:16,757 --> 00:23:19,556
<i>You saw Glory?
This is the best we had.</i>

440
00:23:19,557 --> 00:23:20,960
Well, come along.

441
00:23:20,961 --> 00:23:22,522
I told you.

442
00:23:23,467 --> 00:23:26,697
Wow, Captain, it's quite
an establishment you've got here.

443
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:28,568
My sanctum sanctorum.

444
00:23:34,478 --> 00:23:37,913
Fine jewelry, yes. Even my
vintage pocket watch collection.

445
00:23:37,914 --> 00:23:41,940
But above all, the finest
Civil War memorabilia

446
00:23:41,941 --> 00:23:44,453
and props
west of the Mississippi.

447
00:23:45,156 --> 00:23:48,682
I can attest to that. I've
repaired nearly half of them.

448
00:23:48,683 --> 00:23:52,785
Sally. I am so happy
to see you,

449
00:23:52,786 --> 00:23:55,763
though I'm a little disappointed
you're not wearing your nurse's uniform.

450
00:23:55,764 --> 00:23:58,801
Griffin called me, frantic,
saying we needed one more outfit.

451
00:23:58,802 --> 00:23:59,926
You okay with that?

452
00:23:59,927 --> 00:24:02,631
I sure am. It's just a shame
you didn't dress me.

453
00:24:02,632 --> 00:24:04,504
Still time for that.

454
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:08,143
Aside from reenacting,

455
00:24:08,144 --> 00:24:09,735
Sally insures
half the regiment.

456
00:24:09,736 --> 00:24:12,577
Auto policies, homeowners.
Even theft.

457
00:24:12,578 --> 00:24:15,675
Speaking of which, Griff, I'm
thinking of insuring my legs.

458
00:24:15,676 --> 00:24:17,379
Sort of like Mary Hart.

459
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:20,480
What do you think,
three, five million a haunch?

460
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:23,082
Keep in mind my calves are
like carved marble.

461
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:25,719
That's not the kind
of policy she writes.

462
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,126
So she wrote yours?

463
00:24:27,127 --> 00:24:31,328
Of course. And it's worth more
than both your legs put together.

464
00:24:31,602 --> 00:24:34,764
Does that policy include
plastic explosives?

465
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:39,375
<i>'Cause I see that you're
packing C-4. Is this authentic?</i>

466
00:24:39,376 --> 00:24:40,875
Better yet,
is it even legal?

467
00:24:40,876 --> 00:24:44,402
For the reenactments. We
fudge the fireworks sometimes.

468
00:24:44,403 --> 00:24:46,540
Our audience goes wild
every year

469
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:49,779
when the fake cannon fire
showers them with dirt.

470
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,717
What do we have here?

471
00:24:52,857 --> 00:24:58,227
C.S. Richmond High Hump. .58-caliber
percussion loader. Iron ramrod.

472
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,725
Good Lord, Burton,
you are a wonk.

473
00:25:01,726 --> 00:25:03,026
What the heck?

474
00:25:03,027 --> 00:25:06,934
Sorry. Sorry. The battlefield
can be pretty messy at times.

475
00:25:09,974 --> 00:25:12,134
What about these jars
with the buttons in them?

476
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:15,736
For the super hardcores. They
soak their brass in urine.

477
00:25:20,651 --> 00:25:22,710
You ready
to try this thing on?

478
00:25:22,953 --> 00:25:24,250
Sure.

479
00:25:30,628 --> 00:25:32,152
Dude, you look awesome.

480
00:25:41,595 --> 00:25:43,070
Are you sure there's
not another uniform?

481
00:25:43,071 --> 00:25:46,507
Yeah. But, I'm checking
with the Ventura Association.

482
00:25:46,777 --> 00:25:49,267
Personally, I think
you look dashing.

483
00:25:49,268 --> 00:25:51,110
I always loved
the marching band.

484
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:58,350
It's not so much me as it
is Mickelson. He's good.

485
00:25:59,256 --> 00:26:01,986
Shawn, we're supposed
to be roughing it.

486
00:26:02,226 --> 00:26:05,787
Gus, for your edification,
they don't have TiVo out here.

487
00:26:07,331 --> 00:26:09,060
Hi, Sally Reynolds.

488
00:26:11,035 --> 00:26:12,900
Keep an eye on
those patties.

489
00:26:13,504 --> 00:26:14,766
Shall we?

490
00:26:15,706 --> 00:26:18,732
Let's go somewhere dark. You
can give me a history lesson.

491
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:29,313
Captain Quantrill, he's the guy that
burned down the abolitionist town?

492
00:26:29,314 --> 00:26:31,684
Lawrence, Kansas, 1863.

493
00:26:31,685 --> 00:26:34,451
A year later they were hell-bent
on assassinating Lincoln.

494
00:26:34,452 --> 00:26:37,789
But Lassiter's great-
great-granddad, Muscum,

495
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,920
he stopped 'em cold
on the bridge, yeah?

496
00:26:39,921 --> 00:26:42,658
Sort of like
a noble calling, right?

497
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:44,097
Something like that.

498
00:26:44,098 --> 00:26:45,634
And the nurse you portray,
who's that?

499
00:26:45,635 --> 00:26:46,691
Jenny Winslow.

500
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:49,204
She lost her husband
and two sons at Lawrence.

501
00:26:49,205 --> 00:26:52,071
She wanted revenge,
and she got it.

502
00:26:54,478 --> 00:26:57,879
And what about you,
Sally Reynolds?

503
00:26:59,483 --> 00:27:00,882
What do you want?

504
00:27:01,485 --> 00:27:03,578
Shouldn't you already know?

505
00:27:03,854 --> 00:27:05,821
Why, because I'm psychic?

506
00:27:05,822 --> 00:27:07,857
My aunt used to think
she was a psychic.

507
00:27:07,858 --> 00:27:09,789
She got predictions wrong
all the time.

508
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:12,419
Then she'd get the smallest
random detail right,

509
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,090
and she'd say, "You see?"

510
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:19,234
So, what you're saying is
that you doubt me?

511
00:27:19,703 --> 00:27:21,603
That hurts my feelings.

512
00:27:22,306 --> 00:27:26,333
Well, you still haven't
guessed what I want.

513
00:27:35,753 --> 00:27:36,981
Damn it!

514
00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:50,967
Shawn? What happened?

515
00:27:51,402 --> 00:27:52,528
Gus.

516
00:27:54,238 --> 00:27:56,229
I know how Nelson Poe
was killed.

517
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:04,113
Good morning, Father.

518
00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:07,140
Good morning, Your Highness.

519
00:28:07,384 --> 00:28:09,375
I lost your pocket watch.

520
00:28:12,723 --> 00:28:16,284
The truth, Shawn, you're
not really my son, are you?

521
00:28:17,027 --> 00:28:20,587
Because I gave you a watch with
the inscription "Don't lose."

522
00:28:20,588 --> 00:28:22,255
And what is
the first thing that you do?

523
00:28:22,256 --> 00:28:24,391
I lose the watch.
You lose the watch!

524
00:28:24,392 --> 00:28:27,197
Well, here's a news flash, Dad.
My birthday wasn't yesterday, okay?

525
00:28:27,198 --> 00:28:28,897
It was four months ago.

526
00:28:28,898 --> 00:28:30,940
Yeah, well, here's
a newsflash for you, kid.

527
00:28:30,941 --> 00:28:33,999
After you were born, it took
you four months to smile at me.

528
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,307
That's when the clock
started ticking.

529
00:28:36,308 --> 00:28:39,542
Look, Shawn, I appreciate this newfound
respect that you've got for time,

530
00:28:39,543 --> 00:28:41,413
but what the hell are you
doing out here in the boonies

531
00:28:41,414 --> 00:28:43,179
with an antique
gold pocket watch?

532
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:47,588
I don't know, trying to clear an
innocent man named George Cheslow?

533
00:28:56,567 --> 00:28:57,726
It's a button.

534
00:28:57,727 --> 00:29:00,827
All right, look,
this case of yours, I...

535
00:29:01,939 --> 00:29:04,134
I've been thinking
about it and...

536
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:05,765
Really?

537
00:29:05,766 --> 00:29:07,970
What? No,
I haven't been "thinking."

538
00:29:09,346 --> 00:29:13,213
Look, killing your wife's lover
is something that's rarely planned.

539
00:29:13,214 --> 00:29:14,375
It usually just happens.

540
00:29:14,376 --> 00:29:17,851
So even if this dentist
Cheslow did plan it,

541
00:29:17,852 --> 00:29:20,651
he's not gonna be some numb nuts
hanging around waiting for love letters

542
00:29:20,652 --> 00:29:22,588
that're gonna point the cops
in his direction, right?

543
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:24,752
Exactly. He's not gonna hang
around like a numb nuts.

544
00:29:24,753 --> 00:29:27,819
So here's the deal. I think
Nelson rolled into this creek

545
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:30,695
and was shot from that tree
right up there.

546
00:29:30,696 --> 00:29:32,758
And you figured
this out last night

547
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:34,928
when you fell on your ass
down here by yourself.

548
00:29:34,929 --> 00:29:36,266
Right on my ass.

549
00:29:36,267 --> 00:29:39,103
Now all I need to do
is find the missing bullet.

550
00:29:39,104 --> 00:29:42,475
And how and where do we find
this missing bullet?

551
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,387
How about right here?

552
00:29:56,293 --> 00:29:59,387
Shawn, what about the watch?

553
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:05,364
You mean this watch?

554
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,934
Hey, I needed
a metal detector.

555
00:30:07,935 --> 00:30:12,066
Target was out of stock. And you
won't let anyone use yours, so...

556
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:14,634
Hey, I found the bullet.

557
00:30:14,635 --> 00:30:17,578
Well, hey, you didn't find
the killer, did you?

558
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:20,674
You need to find
the killer.

559
00:30:24,254 --> 00:30:25,845
Hell of an exit.

560
00:30:25,846 --> 00:30:28,153
P.S., you look like an idiot.

561
00:30:29,393 --> 00:30:31,758
I am warning you, he'd
better not be wasting my time.

562
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:34,490
Honestly, Detective, I've never
seen him so excited before.

563
00:30:34,491 --> 00:30:36,930
"Four score
and seven years ago..."

564
00:30:36,931 --> 00:30:38,024
Shawn!

565
00:30:38,025 --> 00:30:40,433
"Ask not what your country
can do for you..."

566
00:30:40,434 --> 00:30:41,902
Shawn! "...but
what you can do for..."

567
00:30:41,903 --> 00:30:43,939
Gus? Is that you?
Shawn!

568
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:46,943
Yellow! All I see is yellow.

569
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:50,477
Yellow and the number two.

570
00:30:50,478 --> 00:30:52,104
I'm already getting
a bad feeling here.

571
00:30:52,105 --> 00:30:55,912
There's lead. No, graphite.

572
00:30:55,913 --> 00:30:58,715
Fine, I'll play. A pencil?

573
00:30:58,716 --> 00:31:01,621
Yes, a yellow pencil.

574
00:31:01,622 --> 00:31:03,454
You see a yellow pencil?

575
00:31:03,455 --> 00:31:04,823
Yes.
Where?

576
00:31:04,824 --> 00:31:07,624
I'm not sure. Please,
help me, Detective, please.

577
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:09,256
A little to your left.

578
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:13,166
Back to your right.

579
00:31:14,304 --> 00:31:16,898
Oh, you are getting warm,
you are so warm!

580
00:31:17,174 --> 00:31:18,470
Oh, gosh!

581
00:31:18,471 --> 00:31:21,375
You're burning up!
How can you stand that?

582
00:31:25,082 --> 00:31:28,642
Great, you found a pencil.
Now we can all take the SATs.

583
00:31:28,643 --> 00:31:31,209
There's more. The evidence,
the critical evidence,

584
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:34,381
it's there, just look closer.

585
00:31:34,382 --> 00:31:36,187
Look closer.

586
00:31:43,467 --> 00:31:45,696
That's it. Gus.

587
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:47,360
That's it. That's the
bullet that killed Poe.

588
00:31:47,361 --> 00:31:49,132
And I bet when I run it through
ballistics, it's gonna match

589
00:31:49,133 --> 00:31:50,433
George Cheslow's musket.

590
00:31:50,434 --> 00:31:52,030
No, you're wrong,
it's not Cheslow.

591
00:31:52,031 --> 00:31:55,544
O'Hara. Yeah.
We're on our way.

592
00:31:55,545 --> 00:31:56,873
<i>It's a 439 in progress.</i>

593
00:31:56,874 --> 00:31:58,004
Four thirty-nine?
Yeah.

594
00:31:58,005 --> 00:31:59,571
We gotta go.

595
00:31:59,572 --> 00:32:02,048
Wait, I was...

596
00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:04,313
I'm not finished!
There's more!

597
00:32:04,314 --> 00:32:05,878
E-mail me!

598
00:32:07,591 --> 00:32:10,492
Juliet!
I found the bullet! I...

599
00:32:12,863 --> 00:32:14,330
Should we go?

600
00:32:14,765 --> 00:32:15,993
No.

601
00:32:17,134 --> 00:32:19,863
No. Let's run through this

602
00:32:19,864 --> 00:32:22,303
from the killer's
point of view.

603
00:32:25,008 --> 00:32:27,476
Okay, Nelson was shot
from up here.

604
00:32:28,378 --> 00:32:29,537
Let's do a list.

605
00:32:29,538 --> 00:32:31,376
Okay. One.

606
00:32:31,782 --> 00:32:33,715
The killer climbs
the tree, like so.

607
00:32:33,716 --> 00:32:35,080
Right. Two?

608
00:32:35,081 --> 00:32:37,449
He gets ready
to shoot from here.

609
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,646
Three.

610
00:32:38,647 --> 00:32:42,158
Three. Nelson rolls down the
creek, way past his mark.

611
00:32:42,526 --> 00:32:43,788
Four.

612
00:32:45,262 --> 00:32:47,286
Looks up, sees the bad guy.

613
00:32:47,287 --> 00:32:50,127
Okay, which means Nelson
wasn't the original target!

614
00:32:50,128 --> 00:32:51,928
Bingo.
He interrupted the plan.

615
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:54,265
Okay, look up there
and see if you see a notch.

616
00:32:54,266 --> 00:32:55,770
You know,
that would steady a gun.

617
00:32:55,771 --> 00:32:56,896
A notch.

618
00:32:56,897 --> 00:32:58,838
Yeah, like a notch.

619
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:01,309
It should lead us
to the intended target.

620
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,080
That's not a notch.

621
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:06,773
That's a notch.

622
00:33:12,422 --> 00:33:14,049
The hospital tent.

623
00:33:15,459 --> 00:33:17,323
Dude, I think I got it.
What?

624
00:33:17,324 --> 00:33:19,156
Sally Reynolds.

625
00:33:19,157 --> 00:33:21,025
Sally Reynolds?
Sally Reynolds.

626
00:33:21,026 --> 00:33:23,327
Why would someone want
to kill Sally Reynolds?

627
00:33:23,328 --> 00:33:25,095
I have no idea.

628
00:33:30,507 --> 00:33:33,943
<i>Folks, our Civil War
re-enactment has begun.</i>

629
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:38,841
Hey, what's up, guys?

630
00:33:38,842 --> 00:33:40,542
You're going to get a call
from a very irate Sally Reynolds

631
00:33:40,543 --> 00:33:42,880
saying two guys just drove by and
stole her dress. Just ignore it, okay?

632
00:33:42,881 --> 00:33:44,977
What the hell are you guys
doing? Sally was the target.

633
00:33:44,978 --> 00:33:47,079
Shawn's gonna put on that dress
and wait for someone to shoot him.

634
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,716
Right, but the plan sounds a lot
better when you don't say it like that.

635
00:33:49,717 --> 00:33:51,555
Listen, Detective,
we have reason to believe

636
00:33:51,556 --> 00:33:52,958
that the intended target
was Sally Reynolds.

637
00:33:52,959 --> 00:33:54,053
Now, we've stolen her dress

638
00:33:54,054 --> 00:33:56,826
and we're gonna catch the
yellow-bellied son of a bitch red-handed.

639
00:33:56,827 --> 00:33:58,730
I forced the ending,
that's horrible.

640
00:33:58,731 --> 00:34:01,895
So, risking getting shot is
the only way to solve the case?

641
00:34:01,896 --> 00:34:03,734
Absolutely. Then we
should stop the battle.

642
00:34:03,735 --> 00:34:04,932
No, we can't.
It's too late.

643
00:34:04,933 --> 00:34:07,238
They're gonna start in less
than a minute. Listen, Juliet,

644
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:08,970
please let us go?

645
00:34:08,971 --> 00:34:10,274
I can't let you do that.

646
00:34:11,575 --> 00:34:13,512
You're a civilian.
It's too dangerous.

647
00:34:13,513 --> 00:34:14,572
It's fine.

648
00:34:14,573 --> 00:34:16,642
We'll spot the guy well
before he gets a shot off.

649
00:34:17,621 --> 00:34:19,349
I'll do it. I'll do it.
What?

650
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,913
Juliet?

651
00:34:21,725 --> 00:34:23,249
Charge!

652
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,965
Careful, Gus!
Sorry!

653
00:34:36,966 --> 00:34:38,438
Just take a deep breath.
Okay.

654
00:34:38,439 --> 00:34:41,476
I don't think these dresses were
intended to fit over a bulletproof vest.

655
00:34:41,477 --> 00:34:44,035
Remember, we will be out
there watching. Got you.

656
00:34:44,036 --> 00:34:46,547
To catch the bad guy before
you get shot. I understand.

657
00:34:46,548 --> 00:34:49,312
But just in case, I want you
to bob left, weave right.

658
00:34:49,313 --> 00:34:51,512
Traditional bob and weave, no
reason to get fancy out there.

659
00:34:51,513 --> 00:34:52,576
And don't become
an easy target.

660
00:34:52,577 --> 00:34:53,985
I did go to
the academy.

661
00:34:53,986 --> 00:34:55,580
Or you could die.

662
00:34:55,581 --> 00:34:56,716
Right.

663
00:34:56,717 --> 00:34:58,191
Now remember, the fifth
cannon boom is your cue

664
00:34:58,192 --> 00:34:59,558
to shoot whoever's
playing Quantrill.

665
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:01,426
Right. Wait,
how do you know that?

666
00:35:01,427 --> 00:35:02,828
I read the manual.
Didn't you?

667
00:35:02,829 --> 00:35:04,457
<i>I didn't open the manual,
it was like War and Peace.</i>

668
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:06,125
There were 17 chapters.
It's the manual, Shawn.

669
00:35:06,126 --> 00:35:07,260
- It was this thick...
- Hey.

670
00:35:07,261 --> 00:35:08,803
- Hey.
- Sorry.

671
00:35:08,804 --> 00:35:12,568
Sorry, sorry, sorry. All about you
right now. All right, you're a champion.

672
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:14,633
Now go out there
and catch us a killer.

673
00:35:14,634 --> 00:35:17,304
Juliet, please be careful.

674
00:35:17,305 --> 00:35:18,905
And don't die.

675
00:35:19,216 --> 00:35:21,308
How many times you gonna
say die? Shawn, just get...

676
00:35:21,309 --> 00:35:23,818
You're putting the word "die" into
her head. She knows there's a killer!

677
00:35:23,819 --> 00:35:24,875
Guys?
Yeah?

678
00:35:24,876 --> 00:35:26,252
A favor.
Sure! Name it.

679
00:35:26,823 --> 00:35:27,983
Kick me.

680
00:35:28,325 --> 00:35:29,656
Do what?

681
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:31,554
- Kick me!
- Okay!

682
00:35:42,606 --> 00:35:43,765
Now what?

683
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:46,400
Now we get ready
to find a killer.

684
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:02,921
Here it comes.
The moment of truth.

685
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:19,833
Where's our killer?

686
00:36:21,211 --> 00:36:23,543
That's weird. Nobody came.

687
00:36:23,947 --> 00:36:26,972
Well, at least Juliet
is out of danger now.

688
00:36:26,973 --> 00:36:28,210
What?

689
00:36:32,589 --> 00:36:34,853
Well, I wonder
where this leads.

690
00:36:52,542 --> 00:36:54,509
Watch your head.

691
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:57,445
Oh, did you get sewage
on your feather?

692
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:06,250
We've crossed to the other
side of the creek bed.

693
00:37:06,251 --> 00:37:08,517
Yeah, the police accounted
for all of the Union soldiers.

694
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:12,459
But nobody's considered that the
murderer could have come from this side.

695
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,995
After all, this was
the bad side, right?

696
00:37:14,996 --> 00:37:17,090
You know that's right.

697
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:27,041
May I ask, who goes out on the
battlefield without their boots?

698
00:37:27,042 --> 00:37:28,508
Maybe someone has bunions.

699
00:37:28,509 --> 00:37:30,807
Bunions, Gus? Really? That's
what you're bringing to the table?

700
00:37:30,808 --> 00:37:32,177
I'm trying to solve
a murder here.

701
00:37:32,178 --> 00:37:33,875
I deal with bunions
at work every day, Shawn.

702
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,507
They hurt...
They hurt people.

703
00:37:35,508 --> 00:37:36,846
That's a perfectly
logical assumption.

704
00:37:36,847 --> 00:37:40,048
Oh, yeah? What about
this? No tunic.

705
00:37:42,826 --> 00:37:44,487
This is Mahoney's!

706
00:37:47,831 --> 00:37:48,820
What?

707
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:53,093
The brass button.

708
00:37:54,137 --> 00:37:55,661
Mahoney did it.

709
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,874
That's why he had
that sticky musket.

710
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:02,410
He must've gotten sap on it
from that notch in the tree.

711
00:38:02,411 --> 00:38:06,414
Wait. This doesn't track. Why kill
Sally? She's hot, they're friends.

712
00:38:06,415 --> 00:38:07,745
She even wrote
his insurance policy.

713
00:38:09,581 --> 00:38:11,120
<i>That was C-4!</i>

714
00:38:11,354 --> 00:38:13,879
That didn't come from the
battlefield, it came from the south.

715
00:38:15,158 --> 00:38:16,215
I solved the crime.
No, I did.

716
00:38:16,216 --> 00:38:17,350
I said it first.
I identified the uniform.

717
00:38:17,351 --> 00:38:19,917
I found the button near the tree. I
said it first. Tap, tap, no take-backs.

718
00:38:19,918 --> 00:38:21,462
<i>That's not fair, Shawn. I
was identifying the C-4 sound.</i>

719
00:38:21,463 --> 00:38:24,466
Dude, you snooze you lose,
Gus. I don't have to tell you.

720
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:27,032
That manhole we found
connects to the sewer.

721
00:38:27,033 --> 00:38:29,867
It's going to lead us right
to our killer. Let's go.

722
00:38:29,868 --> 00:38:30,997
We're going in by ourself?

723
00:38:30,998 --> 00:38:32,541
What, are you crazy?

724
00:38:47,057 --> 00:38:49,547
Where you going, Mahoney?
Hey, Griff!

725
00:38:49,548 --> 00:38:51,456
Hello, boys.

726
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:54,729
Back off. Back off.

727
00:38:55,398 --> 00:38:58,697
Back off. This gun is loaded.

728
00:39:01,204 --> 00:39:03,695
Yes, but mine are
so much bigger.

729
00:39:04,407 --> 00:39:05,600
Get out of the way,
I'm coming through.

730
00:39:05,601 --> 00:39:08,337
What the hell is
going on down here?

731
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:10,605
Colonel,

732
00:39:10,606 --> 00:39:12,944
arrest this traitor.

733
00:39:15,318 --> 00:39:17,878
I'll have that weapon,
Captain.

734
00:39:25,362 --> 00:39:28,956
Okay, hold on, I'm gonna need
you to walk me through this.

735
00:39:28,957 --> 00:39:30,726
Mahoney blew up
his own vault?

736
00:39:30,727 --> 00:39:33,632
That is an absolutely
outrageous... Shut up!

737
00:39:33,633 --> 00:39:35,830
Not only did he blow it up,

738
00:39:36,072 --> 00:39:38,539
he used the battle as a cover
to rob his own store.

739
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:42,099
Then, he'd collect a multi-million dollar
insurance policy in a couple of weeks,

740
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,339
then slip back to the
battle during the cannon fire

741
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,974
with no one ever
being the wiser.

742
00:39:48,451 --> 00:39:52,887
Oh, ye immoral
man of low fiber!

743
00:39:52,888 --> 00:39:54,354
You should really
eat more bran.

744
00:39:54,355 --> 00:39:55,788
I want to see my lawyer.

745
00:39:55,789 --> 00:39:57,382
In due time.

746
00:39:57,383 --> 00:40:00,951
Wait, but I still don't
understand. Why kill Nelson Poe?

747
00:40:00,952 --> 00:40:03,157
That is the rub, isn't it?

748
00:40:03,158 --> 00:40:05,598
Sally Reynolds was
the intended target.

749
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,660
The question is why?

750
00:40:09,005 --> 00:40:10,904
Hi, Juliet.
Got your message.

751
00:40:10,905 --> 00:40:12,099
What the hell is going on?

752
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,698
Oh, I can see it
clearly now.

753
00:40:13,699 --> 00:40:16,438
Sally wrote Mahoney's multi-million
dollar insurance policy.

754
00:40:16,439 --> 00:40:18,037
That means she...

755
00:40:18,882 --> 00:40:21,281
She was in on the fraud
from the start.

756
00:40:21,282 --> 00:40:22,783
That's a lie.

757
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:26,617
But Mahoney here didn't want to share
those millions, so he gets an idea.

758
00:40:26,618 --> 00:40:29,214
What if sweet, sweet Sally
with the filthy mouth

759
00:40:29,215 --> 00:40:31,725
and the bedroom eyes
had a little accident

760
00:40:31,726 --> 00:40:34,126
out on the battlefield
during the rehearsal?

761
00:40:34,127 --> 00:40:36,426
You mean Griffin tried
to kill me? That's right.

762
00:40:36,427 --> 00:40:38,659
This is a lie. You are fabricating
everything you're saying.

763
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,065
Now you hold on a second,
Mr. Mahoney.

764
00:40:40,066 --> 00:40:43,502
Oh, hey, Gus, you see, when
Nelson rolled down the creek bed

765
00:40:43,503 --> 00:40:45,267
<i>and landed too close
to the river, he looked up</i>

766
00:40:45,268 --> 00:40:48,139
<i>and he saw Griffin in the tree
with his trusty musket, who said,</i>

767
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:51,668
"Griffin, now you must
kill Nelson Poe

768
00:40:51,669 --> 00:40:54,683
"to keep his
stinking mouth shut."

769
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:56,716
Told you you had
the wrong person, Lassiter.

770
00:40:56,717 --> 00:40:57,980
I know.

771
00:40:58,188 --> 00:41:02,317
Detective O'Hara... Lose the hoop
skirt before you hurt someone.

772
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:04,724
Read 'em their rights
and book ' em.

773
00:41:06,896 --> 00:41:08,727
Excuse me, gentlemen.

774
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:12,892
Hey, it was good work,
Detective. We got 'em.

775
00:41:12,893 --> 00:41:13,992
"We"?

776
00:41:13,993 --> 00:41:15,867
We're a team, right?

777
00:41:24,547 --> 00:41:28,448
Gus. When we grow up,
think I'll ever be as cool as you?

778
00:41:28,449 --> 00:41:30,985
You're better at kickball.

779
00:41:30,986 --> 00:41:32,578
Not what I asked.

780
00:41:33,356 --> 00:41:34,549
We talking about
your dad again?

781
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:36,090
Mmm-hmm.

782
00:41:36,091 --> 00:41:38,683
Come on, dude.
The guy respects you.

783
00:41:38,684 --> 00:41:40,228
Not like he does you.

784
00:41:40,229 --> 00:41:41,490
I'm not his son.

785
00:41:41,491 --> 00:41:44,658
I mean, he might like me okay,
but he loves you.

786
00:41:45,568 --> 00:41:46,966
Did he say that?

787
00:41:46,967 --> 00:41:47,717
No.

788
00:41:48,538 --> 00:41:50,596
Then how can you be sure?

789
00:41:50,597 --> 00:41:53,198
You mean he's never said it?

790
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:55,608
Come on, Gus. We're guys.

791
00:42:02,585 --> 00:42:04,052
Charge!
Charge!

792
00:42:13,963 --> 00:42:17,454
<i>In between the lines
there's a lot of obscurity</i>

793
00:42:17,455 --> 00:42:21,034
<i>I'm not inclined
to resign to maturity</i>

794
00:42:21,035 --> 00:42:24,366
<i>If it's all right
then you're all wrong</i>

795
00:42:24,367 --> 00:42:27,808
<i>But why bounce around
to the same damn song?</i>

796
00:42:29,245 --> 00:42:33,443
<i>You'd rather run
when you can't crawl</i>

797
00:42:35,418 --> 00:42:38,751
<i>I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth</i>

798
00:42:38,955 --> 00:42:42,219
<i>I know, you know
They just don't have any proof</i>

799
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,283
<i>Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend</i>

800
00:42:45,284 --> 00:42:49,386
<i>Your worst inhibitions tend
to psych you out in the end</i>

801
00:42:49,387 --> 00:42:51,434
<i>I know, you know</i>

802
00:42:52,969 --> 00:42:54,766
<i>I know, you know</i>
