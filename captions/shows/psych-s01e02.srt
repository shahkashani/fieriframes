1
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:24,585
Excuse me,
you're in my seat.

2
00:00:25,324 --> 00:00:27,813
Am I?
Actually, yes, you are.

3
00:00:27,814 --> 00:00:29,825
You one of those
weirdo compulsives

4
00:00:29,826 --> 00:00:31,724
who come to the same restaurant,
sit in the same chair,

5
00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:34,094
and eat the same food
every day?

6
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:37,231
No, no, no, I was sitting
right there three minutes ago,

7
00:00:37,232 --> 00:00:40,598
and then I went outside
to get myself a paper.

8
00:00:40,599 --> 00:00:44,502
I ordered a juice, and look, I made a
crawling snake with the straw wrapper.

9
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:46,267
You can finish it if you think
you're up to the job.

10
00:00:46,268 --> 00:00:48,332
I'm sorry.
You want me to move?

11
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:49,843
Not anymore.

12
00:00:51,146 --> 00:00:52,702
So, what's up? I don't
have time to talk.

13
00:00:52,703 --> 00:00:54,076
But you haven't heard
what I'm going to say.

14
00:00:54,077 --> 00:00:57,049
See, now we've already
talked more than I wanted to.

15
00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:06,487
Well, I did give you
my seat, you know.

16
00:01:06,488 --> 00:01:07,753
I think that gets me
one question.

17
00:01:07,754 --> 00:01:09,589
Listen, diner guy...
Shawn.

18
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,322
Shawn. Flattered, really.

19
00:01:11,323 --> 00:01:13,227
Very often, I am happy
to meet new people.

20
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:15,630
But today, right here,
right now, I can't talk.

21
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:17,430
I understand. I do.

22
00:01:17,836 --> 00:01:20,030
What if I do the talking
for both of us?

23
00:01:20,031 --> 00:01:21,196
Have at it!

24
00:01:21,197 --> 00:01:22,432
Do you mind if
I read the paper

25
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:24,736
and stare aimlessly out the
window while you two talk?

26
00:01:24,737 --> 00:01:27,299
No. Can I get a name
to work with?

27
00:01:28,012 --> 00:01:29,206
Juliet.

28
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,074
Well, it's very nice
to meet you, Juliet.

29
00:01:32,075 --> 00:01:33,911
It's
nice to meet you, too, Shawn.

30
00:01:33,912 --> 00:01:37,577
And I am sorry about your
seat. So, lunch is on me.

31
00:01:37,578 --> 00:01:39,086
So, what do you
do for a living?

32
00:01:39,087 --> 00:01:40,382
I do a
little bit of everything.

33
00:01:40,383 --> 00:01:41,717
Oh, that sounds interesting.

34
00:01:41,718 --> 00:01:43,279
And maybe a little bit
dangerous.

35
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,654
Oh, I like your jacket.
I like it...

36
00:01:44,655 --> 00:01:46,693
Okay, can I stop you here?

37
00:01:46,694 --> 00:01:48,922
First off, in your
portrayal of me,

38
00:01:48,923 --> 00:01:50,554
I sound like I'm
in the eighth grade.

39
00:01:50,555 --> 00:01:52,963
Well, in my portrayal of you, you
only have an eighth grade education.

40
00:01:55,169 --> 00:01:58,968
All right, smarten you up.
College, yeah?

41
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:02,167
Top your class,
graduate early... Got it.

42
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,608
I'm new to
town, and I don't know many people.

43
00:02:07,747 --> 00:02:10,408
But I do know my cats.
Two of them.

44
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,248
The gray one is
very affectionate,

45
00:02:12,249 --> 00:02:15,616
the white one makes me work much,
much harder for the attention.

46
00:02:15,617 --> 00:02:17,177
And what about your family?

47
00:02:18,756 --> 00:02:20,587
My family is amazing!

48
00:02:21,192 --> 00:02:24,251
My parents have been together
for, what is it, 30 years now?

49
00:02:24,252 --> 00:02:25,851
Okay, do we know each other?

50
00:02:25,852 --> 00:02:28,591
Yes, you were the girl
who stole my seat!

51
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:41,174
Oh, my gosh, you're a cop!

52
00:02:41,175 --> 00:02:42,231
I'm not a cop!

53
00:02:42,232 --> 00:02:45,278
The paper, the vantage point,
the layout, of course!

54
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:49,339
You got defensive when Scary Guy
walked in, you're totally a cop!

55
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,350
Okay, Shawn, I may need you
to do me a favor.

56
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:53,909
Name it.
Duck!

57
00:02:54,254 --> 00:02:55,414
Police!

58
00:02:56,423 --> 00:02:57,617
Gun! Go!

59
00:02:59,293 --> 00:03:00,884
Let me go!
Get him up!

60
00:03:01,594 --> 00:03:02,925
Come on!

61
00:03:16,675 --> 00:03:18,801
First time
pulling your gun?

62
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,904
Maybe.

63
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,584
<i>I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth</i>

64
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:41,753
<i>I know, you know
They just don't have any proof</i>

65
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:45,025
<i>Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend</i>

66
00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:49,229
<i>Your worst inhibitions tend
to psych you out in the end</i>

67
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:57,704
Thirty seconds,
Mr. Guster.

68
00:03:59,545 --> 00:04:00,265
A-G...

69
00:04:06,552 --> 00:04:07,779
...G...

70
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:18,084
Let me start over!
"Aggiornamento."

71
00:04:19,296 --> 00:04:20,422
A...

72
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:23,593
...G...

73
00:04:24,668 --> 00:04:25,929
...G...

74
00:04:35,577 --> 00:04:36,669
...O...

75
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:45,442
<i>Beautiful
Santa Barbara, California,</i>

76
00:04:45,443 --> 00:04:49,010
<i>is the backdrop for this afternoon's
coverage of the American Spelling Bee,</i>

77
00:04:49,011 --> 00:04:51,351
<i>being held at the downtown
Cabrillo Theater.</i>

78
00:04:51,352 --> 00:04:53,618
<i>Champions from all over
these western United States</i>

79
00:04:53,619 --> 00:04:55,854
<i>have made the trek to test...</i>

80
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,993
What are you watching?
Nothing.

81
00:04:58,994 --> 00:05:01,657
Is that Korean porn?
Come on, man!

82
00:05:01,658 --> 00:05:04,997
It's the Regional Finals
of the American Spelling Bee.

83
00:05:04,998 --> 00:05:06,128
What?

84
00:05:06,605 --> 00:05:08,970
Don't mock me.
It's a huge event.

85
00:05:09,407 --> 00:05:13,206
No, I'm just... I'm shocked that
you didn't take the whole day off.

86
00:05:13,207 --> 00:05:15,403
It's on Sports Cal Two,
for your information.

87
00:05:15,404 --> 00:05:16,604
And it's hosted
by Bud Collins.

88
00:05:16,605 --> 00:05:19,944
Really? Did they bump the car
washing championships for this?

89
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:23,542
And is it over soon? 'Cause I'd like
to get back to the woodcarving finals.

90
00:05:23,543 --> 00:05:25,552
<i>Let's recap this
morning's unexpected high drama.</i>

91
00:05:25,553 --> 00:05:27,451
It's being held in
Santa Barbara this year.

92
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,583
Down at the Cabrillo.
It's huge. Sold out.

93
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,951
<i>All the experts are
shaking their heads.</i>

94
00:05:31,952 --> 00:05:33,686
I tried to get tickets,
but you gotta know somebody.

95
00:05:33,687 --> 00:05:36,354
Somebody lame. Dude, I can't
believe you're watching that!

96
00:05:36,355 --> 00:05:38,728
I'm taping it! And I don't
care what you think, Shawn,

97
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:40,061
I watch the bee semis
every year.

98
00:05:40,062 --> 00:05:42,999
Okay, for your sake and mine, stop giving
the spelling bee hip little nicknames.

99
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,731
<i>For those
of you who have just joined us,</i>

100
00:05:45,732 --> 00:05:49,469
<i>well, a bit of a shock.
And a little sad, too.</i>

101
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:54,241
<i>The heavy favorite has had a
bad spell, and Brendan Vu is out!</i>

102
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,276
<i>What?
Boo-hoo for Vu, Bud.</i>

103
00:05:56,277 --> 00:05:58,872
No way. Brendan Vu is out?
Already?

104
00:05:58,873 --> 00:05:59,973
Okay, now you're
just scaring me.

105
00:05:59,974 --> 00:06:02,143
Come on, Shawn. He took second
last year, everybody knows that!

106
00:06:02,144 --> 00:06:06,315
No, Gus, nobody knows that,
except for Brendan and his mother.

107
00:06:06,316 --> 00:06:07,549
Okay.

108
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,421
<i>We're gonna show this again.</i>

109
00:06:09,422 --> 00:06:11,687
<i>It looks like
young Mr. Vu</i>

110
00:06:11,688 --> 00:06:13,160
<i>may be having
trouble breathing.</i>

111
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:15,924
<i>He does look to be under
some sort of duress, Bud.</i>

112
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:18,593
<i>His inhaler did not appear
to help, and Vu tumbled.</i>

113
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,824
<i>Dang! Paramedics
rushed to the scene,</i>

114
00:06:20,825 --> 00:06:22,871
<i>and within moments, the competition
had taken an unexpected turn.</i>

115
00:06:22,872 --> 00:06:25,202
Wait a second.
Did you see that?

116
00:06:31,013 --> 00:06:33,571
This is no accident. There's
something wrong with that inhaler.

117
00:06:33,572 --> 00:06:35,512
Shawn, get out of here.

118
00:06:35,513 --> 00:06:38,778
<i>For 35 minutes,
competition was suspended.</i>

119
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:39,841
Psych.

120
00:06:39,842 --> 00:06:43,582
<i>...and Vu and his family were
rushed to the hospital. It's the Chief.</i>

121
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,180
I'll have to check with Gus.

122
00:06:45,181 --> 00:06:46,885
Are we available?

123
00:06:47,127 --> 00:06:48,650
Appears we are.

124
00:06:48,651 --> 00:06:49,955
We'll be right there.

125
00:06:50,696 --> 00:06:51,992
What? I can get us
into the spelling bee.

126
00:06:51,993 --> 00:06:53,087
Really?

127
00:06:53,088 --> 00:06:54,825
Guess I was right about
the whole Bandon Dunes thing.

128
00:06:54,826 --> 00:06:56,491
Brendan Vu.
Sure.

129
00:06:56,492 --> 00:06:57,762
They need a psychic
detective for that?

130
00:06:57,763 --> 00:06:59,234
They don't,

131
00:07:00,071 --> 00:07:01,902
unless he was sabotaged.

132
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,903
The kid said his
inhaler felt funny.

133
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:07,273
When he used it,
his hand stung,

134
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:09,642
paramedics get there,
there's no inhaler.

135
00:07:09,643 --> 00:07:11,976
Apparently, the thing just
vanished into thin air.

136
00:07:11,977 --> 00:07:14,313
Shawn, we are so taking this!
Let's go!

137
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,845
How come I can't get you this
excited about girls? Let's go, Shawn!

138
00:07:17,846 --> 00:07:19,182
Or Mexico?

139
00:07:27,796 --> 00:07:28,819
We're here!

140
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,524
Go on in, Mr. Spencer. I've
arranged everything you need inside.

141
00:07:31,525 --> 00:07:34,192
You're leaving? Oh, I was only
here for the mayor's presentation,

142
00:07:34,193 --> 00:07:36,201
and we have a robbery
standoff across town.

143
00:07:36,202 --> 00:07:37,964
Whoa, shouldn't I go
to the hospital,

144
00:07:37,965 --> 00:07:39,971
meet the victim,
get his statement?

145
00:07:39,972 --> 00:07:42,336
Mr. Spencer,
the case is sabotage.

146
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:46,136
<i>There are 43 remaining contestants,
all presumably with a motive.</i>

147
00:07:46,137 --> 00:07:49,270
Now, you can read guilt just
by talking with someone, right?

148
00:07:49,271 --> 00:07:50,439
Do it.

149
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,607
You want us to talk to all
of them? And their parents.

150
00:07:52,608 --> 00:07:54,742
Today?
Mmm-hmm. By 5:00.

151
00:07:54,743 --> 00:07:56,616
In two days,
this whole thing is over.

152
00:07:56,617 --> 00:07:58,881
At that time, all the witnesses
will be in 100 different cities

153
00:07:58,882 --> 00:08:00,422
all over the western
United States.

154
00:08:00,423 --> 00:08:02,959
So, it's now or never.

155
00:08:04,662 --> 00:08:05,720
Good luck.

156
00:08:09,232 --> 00:08:12,291
<i>Spellmaster Elvin
Cavanaugh is a secretive guy,</i>

157
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:16,702
<i>and yet, he has called for a
press conference after this round!</i>

158
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:19,397
<i>Can you repeat that, please?</i>

159
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:20,965
<i>"Butyraceous."</i>

160
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,071
<i>Definition, please?</i>

161
00:08:23,072 --> 00:08:24,541
<i>Adjective.</i>

162
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:27,273
<i>"Having the characteristics
of butter. "</i>

163
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,539
This thing's been
sold out for weeks.

164
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:35,315
I can see why. It moves so fast,
it's like hockey with words.

165
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:37,920
There's Elvin Cavanaugh, the
greatest spell champion ever.

166
00:08:37,921 --> 00:08:40,480
<i>He's been the spellmaster
for 14 years.</i>

167
00:08:40,481 --> 00:08:41,786
He's a legend.
Wow.

168
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,351
<i>"Butyraceous."</i>

169
00:08:43,696 --> 00:08:45,993
He sits up there all by
himself in that fancy box?

170
00:08:45,994 --> 00:08:47,361
<i>Language of origin?</i>

171
00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:48,693
What is he, the
Phantom of the Opera?

172
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,667
He's a huge celebrity! He
can't just sit in the crowd!

173
00:08:51,668 --> 00:08:53,168
<i>Can you repeat the word?</i>

174
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:54,865
<i>"Butyraceous."</i>

175
00:08:56,241 --> 00:08:57,467
<i>"Butyraceous"?
Oh, come on, dude,</i>

176
00:08:57,468 --> 00:08:58,802
you're not bored at all?

177
00:08:58,803 --> 00:09:01,400
Do you know how to spell
any of these words?

178
00:09:01,401 --> 00:09:04,412
Proudly. I have never heard
of any of these words.

179
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:06,310
I file these words under
"Things to say

180
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:08,440
"when I want to be ridiculed
or kicked out of bed."

181
00:09:08,441 --> 00:09:11,748
See, the problem is that butyraceous
is clearly a Round One word.

182
00:09:11,749 --> 00:09:12,912
Oh, God, stop talking.

183
00:09:12,913 --> 00:09:15,080
I'd like to pretend we still
have things in common, Gus!

184
00:09:15,081 --> 00:09:18,422
Well, instead of sitting here,
maybe we should get to work!

185
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:26,627
Try not to break anything.

186
00:09:26,628 --> 00:09:27,690
Wow!

187
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:30,695
So this is what
it looks like.

188
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:31,758
What?

189
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,304
The comfort room.

190
00:09:33,305 --> 00:09:35,465
This is where you go to
deal with missing a word.

191
00:09:35,466 --> 00:09:37,099
Oh, yeah? Where do they
take you to deal with

192
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,041
missing your entire
childhood?

193
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:42,876
Shawn, this misplaced malevolence
you have with the spelling bee

194
00:09:42,877 --> 00:09:44,813
is getting monotonous.

195
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,184
Stop hating on the bee!

196
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,652
I'm sorry, ma'am, I do apologize
for his inappropriate virulence.

197
00:09:50,653 --> 00:09:52,882
Why are you using all these
big-ass words all of a sudden?

198
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,686
I'm not doing that.

199
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,723
That's preposterous!

200
00:09:59,096 --> 00:10:01,029
I was in the spelling bee
myself.

201
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,086
I almost won.

202
00:10:02,087 --> 00:10:03,153
Dude, are you
still on that?

203
00:10:03,154 --> 00:10:05,665
Of course I'm still on it!
I know it wasn't "O"!

204
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08,999
You may have five minutes
with each contestant, no more.

205
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,129
If the room is needed,
you'll be asked to vacate.

206
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,470
I'll begin with the
eliminated contestants.

207
00:10:13,471 --> 00:10:15,303
Actually, we'd only like
to speak with the ones

208
00:10:15,304 --> 00:10:18,708
that were still in the competition
when the accident occurred.

209
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:20,213
Ms. Foote.

210
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,646
And let's start with the
shifty-eyed ones, shall we?

211
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,320
And you were there
the whole time?

212
00:10:30,357 --> 00:10:31,550
I was.

213
00:10:32,258 --> 00:10:33,725
Assimilation.

214
00:10:34,527 --> 00:10:39,293
A-S-S-l-M-l-L-A-T-l-O-N.
Assimilation.

215
00:10:40,298 --> 00:10:43,630
My son, no one expect him
to come this far.

216
00:10:43,631 --> 00:10:47,467
But he surprise everyone.
You watch him win.

217
00:10:47,468 --> 00:10:50,438
Oh, I don't know. Are they
running odds on this thing now?

218
00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:52,566
'Cause I've got some cash
I'd like to lay down

219
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:55,008
on the really, really tall
girl with the bulldog underbite.

220
00:10:55,009 --> 00:10:56,272
What, is she on stilts?

221
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,944
You do not understand.

222
00:10:58,945 --> 00:11:02,006
This contest, it is
money for scholarship.

223
00:11:02,007 --> 00:11:04,848
It is entry into any
school in the future.

224
00:11:05,621 --> 00:11:07,087
Yeah, Shawn.

225
00:11:07,088 --> 00:11:09,885
The winner of this competition can
just about choose his university.

226
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:10,981
Your friend is right.

227
00:11:10,982 --> 00:11:13,525
And it teaches
grace under pressure.

228
00:11:13,526 --> 00:11:16,256
Poise. Dignity.

229
00:11:17,965 --> 00:11:20,762
All things you can get at a
hot-dog eating competition.

230
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,028
Plus...

231
00:11:24,037 --> 00:11:25,026
Hot dogs.

232
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,465
Still studying, huh?

233
00:11:27,466 --> 00:11:30,475
Oh, she loves it.
Won't put that thing down.

234
00:11:30,843 --> 00:11:33,141
Well, kudos on
the childrearing.

235
00:11:33,546 --> 00:11:35,912
Let me know how
the therapy goes.

236
00:11:36,215 --> 00:11:37,203
Huh?

237
00:11:37,204 --> 00:11:41,784
We're gonna keep rolling because of the
exceptional request by Elvin Cavanaugh,

238
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:45,219
a behind-the-scenes guy,
to give a press conference

239
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,118
right here at this stage
of the competition!

240
00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:49,283
<i>What's that all about?</i>

241
00:11:49,284 --> 00:11:50,985
<i>Well, I mean, this could
be something big, Bud.</i>

242
00:11:50,986 --> 00:11:54,086
<i>I mean, this year's competition has
just been peppered with controversy.</i>

243
00:11:54,087 --> 00:11:55,357
<i>It certainly has.</i>

244
00:11:55,358 --> 00:11:59,799
<i>Well, he's been watching from a
private box on the balcony, but now,</i>

245
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,462
he's going to come out
so that we can see him.

246
00:12:02,463 --> 00:12:05,027
This could
be something big, Bud.

247
00:12:05,028 --> 00:12:07,630
I think he's having
difficulty breathing!

248
00:12:07,631 --> 00:12:09,734
He does look
under duress, Bud.

249
00:12:10,612 --> 00:12:12,579
Oh, jeez!

250
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,738
Oh, my! Oh, my God! Oh!

251
00:12:14,739 --> 00:12:17,215
- Call 911!
- Okay, move over.

252
00:12:21,321 --> 00:12:24,313
Okay. Not to belittle
this guy's life,

253
00:12:25,225 --> 00:12:27,921
but this just got more interesting
than the woodcarving finals.

254
00:12:40,037 --> 00:12:42,436
When do we decide if we
should cancel this event?

255
00:12:42,437 --> 00:12:44,302
Why would we cancel?

256
00:12:44,303 --> 00:12:48,241
Well, a body did just
tumble into the crowd.

257
00:12:49,145 --> 00:12:50,475
Didn't land on anybody.

258
00:12:50,476 --> 00:12:51,706
It might be traumatic.

259
00:12:51,707 --> 00:12:52,804
For who?

260
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:55,145
The mayor, when he realizes all
the hotel rooms are now empty?

261
00:12:55,146 --> 00:12:57,776
We could postpone at least a
day, I'm sure that's allowed.

262
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,616
Do you have any idea how important
this event is to the city?

263
00:13:00,617 --> 00:13:03,054
Now, unhealthy guy
has heart attack,

264
00:13:03,055 --> 00:13:05,091
falls over railing.
Case closed.

265
00:13:05,092 --> 00:13:07,251
Certainly not declaring it
a crime scene.

266
00:13:07,252 --> 00:13:09,819
Come on, you can
introduce me to the press.

267
00:13:10,031 --> 00:13:12,157
Okay, just be sensitive.

268
00:13:12,466 --> 00:13:14,866
How about if we don't sell
the seat the guy landed on?

269
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,031
Can I help you?

270
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,470
Has anyone come
out of there?

271
00:13:20,471 --> 00:13:22,130
Just the cops. I've
been here the whole time.

272
00:13:22,131 --> 00:13:23,265
Did you hear anything
from in there?

273
00:13:23,266 --> 00:13:25,333
I'm sorry, who are you?

274
00:13:25,645 --> 00:13:28,512
I'm Shawn Spencer, I'm a psychic
with the police department.

275
00:13:29,115 --> 00:13:31,013
I'm sorry, Mr. Spencer. Look,
I don't doubt your ability,

276
00:13:31,014 --> 00:13:35,314
I actually have an aunt who can see
apparitions, and some spooky stuff.

277
00:13:35,787 --> 00:13:39,585
But they told me not to let anybody
in here without a badge, so...

278
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:40,749
I see.

279
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:43,684
Okay. As long as
you feel safe.

280
00:13:44,128 --> 00:13:45,254
Safe?

281
00:13:46,396 --> 00:13:49,763
What with the dead guy's spirit
being here, and him being so angry.

282
00:13:51,768 --> 00:13:53,133
How angry?

283
00:13:54,137 --> 00:13:57,195
Well, considering he might
have just been murdered,

284
00:13:57,196 --> 00:13:59,137
that's definitely
a negative.

285
00:14:01,043 --> 00:14:02,101
Man, I wouldn't be happy!

286
00:14:08,783 --> 00:14:11,876
No, please, spare me!
I'm here to help you! Gus!

287
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:15,281
Back me up here!
Oh! Oh! Oh!

288
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:19,314
Segrete ammunus!

289
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:30,897
You guys just take
a quick little look-see, okay?

290
00:14:30,898 --> 00:14:32,698
I'll be downstairs!

291
00:14:38,675 --> 00:14:40,165
Come on, get up!

292
00:14:53,656 --> 00:14:57,091
Well, we certainly know
what his vice was.

293
00:14:58,026 --> 00:14:59,356
He was a heavy eater,
so what?

294
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:02,758
Nothing. I'm just thinking
Lassiter's heart attack theory

295
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:04,593
might not be so far off.

296
00:15:09,803 --> 00:15:11,632
Who's Contestant 1953?

297
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:13,865
It only goes up
to 200-something.

298
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,031
What's 1953 mean?

299
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,104
Nothing.

300
00:15:19,412 --> 00:15:22,676
Is it a rule? No, they don't
really number the rules like that.

301
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:32,584
Think there was
an altercation?

302
00:15:32,585 --> 00:15:35,021
No, something else. He was
all by himself up here.

303
00:15:35,022 --> 00:15:36,650
You smell that?

304
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,453
Dude, don't look at me.

305
00:15:38,454 --> 00:15:40,018
It's sulfuric.

306
00:15:40,563 --> 00:15:42,154
Gus, I am not the one
who had the egg salad.

307
00:15:42,155 --> 00:15:44,859
No, no, no. We manufactured
something last year, heavy stuff.

308
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,763
When it starts to go bad,
smelled the same.

309
00:15:46,764 --> 00:15:49,429
You could pick out a bottle
across the warehouse.

310
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:52,169
I can't smell anything!

311
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,469
Well, you don't have
the supersmeller.

312
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,875
Gus! You have got to stop calling
your nose the supersmeller.

313
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,477
You wanna nickname
a body part?

314
00:15:59,478 --> 00:16:01,104
Nickname your butt, man!

315
00:16:01,105 --> 00:16:03,944
Call it the "tightbouncer,"
or the "hexagon."

316
00:16:03,945 --> 00:16:06,576
Ladies are gonna dig that,
I'm telling you.

317
00:16:06,577 --> 00:16:08,916
It's there. It's right there.
It's subtle, but it's right there.

318
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:10,216
Well, what is it?
I don't know.

319
00:16:10,217 --> 00:16:11,277
It's nothing we manufacture.

320
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:12,414
Aren't you supposed to
know this kind of stuff?

321
00:16:12,415 --> 00:16:14,424
Shawn, I sell pharmaceutical
supplies, I'm not a scientist!

322
00:16:14,425 --> 00:16:17,189
But you're saying it is
something? Yes, I'm pretty sure.

323
00:16:20,165 --> 00:16:21,256
Don't eat it!

324
00:16:21,257 --> 00:16:23,061
What, do I look
like an idiot?

325
00:16:29,773 --> 00:16:31,364
What... What... Are you
taking some to go?

326
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:34,001
Yes! For the road! In case
later on I get hungry enough

327
00:16:34,002 --> 00:16:35,602
to eat something
that might be poisoned!

328
00:16:39,148 --> 00:16:41,673
There are four up there,
and two on the other side.

329
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:43,608
What, you mean those
two guys up there?

330
00:16:43,609 --> 00:16:46,448
Excuse me, hi, it's time.
The press are ready.

331
00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:47,613
Thank you.
All right.

332
00:16:49,124 --> 00:16:50,751
Man, we gotta go!

333
00:16:52,794 --> 00:16:54,020
Sorry, could I just
try that again?

334
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:56,392
I kind of fumbled
the "safe and secure" part.

335
00:16:56,393 --> 00:16:57,624
Sure.

336
00:16:57,832 --> 00:16:58,889
Be sensitive.

337
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,057
Of course.

338
00:17:00,058 --> 00:17:02,623
The finals will continue
tomorrow as scheduled.

339
00:17:02,624 --> 00:17:06,228
At this point, all indications are Mr.
Cavanaugh was having a heart attack,

340
00:17:06,229 --> 00:17:09,002
stumbled forward, falling
over the railing to his death.

341
00:17:09,242 --> 00:17:10,832
But we wanna
assure everyone

342
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,569
that this building
is both safe and...

343
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,907
Our sympathies go out
to Mr. Cavanaugh's family,

344
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,503
and we would like
to offer counseling

345
00:17:16,504 --> 00:17:18,776
- to anyone who feels that they might need it.
- Who's the blonde?

346
00:17:18,777 --> 00:17:20,942
Lassiter's new partner. They
transferred his girlfriend.

347
00:17:20,943 --> 00:17:24,748
And again, we wanna ensure everyone
coming out for this fantastic event

348
00:17:24,749 --> 00:17:26,311
that it is entirely safe.

349
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:27,616
Shawn! They're gonna
stop investigating!

350
00:17:27,617 --> 00:17:29,749
One last question, and then I
really have to go wrap up this thing.

351
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,814
Do something!

352
00:17:30,815 --> 00:17:33,259
Is there any word as to what
Cavanaugh's big announcement was?

353
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,957
Moo goo gai pan!

354
00:17:35,532 --> 00:17:37,863
Beef lo mein, kung pao!

355
00:17:39,502 --> 00:17:42,403
Check the food!
It was murder!

356
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:46,464
Oh, did I just say
all that out loud?

357
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:51,204
Shawn, you'll never find out
what that is without a lab.

358
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:52,210
I'll get a lab.

359
00:17:52,211 --> 00:17:53,973
A high-tech lab?
Right now?

360
00:17:53,974 --> 00:17:55,071
Maybe.

361
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,983
Might have
a connection.

362
00:17:58,952 --> 00:17:59,941
Yo!

363
00:18:00,721 --> 00:18:02,779
Shawn.
Hey, Dad, great shirt!

364
00:18:03,956 --> 00:18:05,115
You want something.

365
00:18:05,116 --> 00:18:06,418
Why do you always think
I want something?

366
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,927
Oh, you don't want anything.
What a pleasant surprise.

367
00:18:11,229 --> 00:18:13,526
Okay, you got me!
I want something.

368
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:15,531
<i>I got a poker game
in 45 minutes.</i>

369
00:18:15,532 --> 00:18:17,157
You still talk
to Jim Syklan?

370
00:18:17,158 --> 00:18:19,428
Syklan? Sometimes.
Why, what's he to you?

371
00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:21,333
Is he still working at the
regional crime lab out here?

372
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:22,632
Last I checked. Why?

373
00:18:22,633 --> 00:18:24,867
I need to know
what this is.

374
00:18:26,043 --> 00:18:28,237
It looks like a Number 15
with chicken.

375
00:18:28,945 --> 00:18:30,742
Dad, you made a joke!

376
00:18:31,214 --> 00:18:33,409
I think
there's poison in it.

377
00:18:34,517 --> 00:18:36,006
Goodbye, Shawn.

378
00:18:38,887 --> 00:18:40,877
It's just one time! Once!

379
00:18:40,878 --> 00:18:44,014
No cases, Shawn! I was
painfully clear about that.

380
00:18:44,015 --> 00:18:45,990
Oh, no, no,
this isn't for a case.

381
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,085
This is for a friend.

382
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,624
Oh, friend, different.

383
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:53,655
No!

384
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:01,328
Look, I'll do anything, whatever
you want, it's one favor.

385
00:19:01,329 --> 00:19:05,103
Anything he can tell me about this
would be very helpful, it's serious.

386
00:19:05,104 --> 00:19:06,973
Shawn, this is really
important to you?

387
00:19:06,974 --> 00:19:08,103
Extremely.

388
00:19:08,104 --> 00:19:09,406
And you'll do anything?

389
00:19:09,407 --> 00:19:10,777
Name it.

390
00:19:13,751 --> 00:19:14,740
Grab a saw.

391
00:19:15,653 --> 00:19:16,676
What, now?

392
00:19:16,677 --> 00:19:19,347
Well, you said you'd
do anything, right?

393
00:19:21,592 --> 00:19:26,585
You know, most people will wait five, six
whole minutes before they cash in a favor.

394
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,222
I will not saw through
bone for you.

395
00:19:36,037 --> 00:19:39,029
The doghouse?
From eighth grade?

396
00:19:39,374 --> 00:19:41,740
Well, it's not really
a doghouse.

397
00:19:42,477 --> 00:19:43,567
Not yet.

398
00:19:43,568 --> 00:19:45,042
What do you
want me to do?

399
00:19:45,043 --> 00:19:46,135
Finish it.

400
00:19:46,136 --> 00:19:47,510
What, now?

401
00:19:48,582 --> 00:19:50,708
Or whenever you want
your information.

402
00:19:50,709 --> 00:19:55,048
You got more wood out back, nails on the
workbench, Home Depot's open till 9:00.

403
00:19:55,049 --> 00:19:56,986
Don't cut any corners.

404
00:20:01,226 --> 00:20:02,749
You're insane!

405
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,293
You're losing light.

406
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:07,529
Make sure you lock up.

407
00:20:12,103 --> 00:20:14,333
It's creepy that
you kept this!

408
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:22,208
Shawn, you've
done absolutely nothing

409
00:20:22,209 --> 00:20:24,838
to convince me that you're
responsible enough for a dog.

410
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:25,970
You'll never give me
a chance.

411
00:20:25,971 --> 00:20:28,038
Chances are earned, Shawn.

412
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:30,244
You'll never
let me earn it!

413
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:35,421
Fair enough.

414
00:20:36,391 --> 00:20:37,982
You're gonna need
a doghouse.

415
00:20:37,983 --> 00:20:40,549
I saw one at the hardware
store. No. No, no, no.

416
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:43,117
You're gonna make it.
I can't.

417
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:44,526
Well, it seems to me
that somebody who thinks

418
00:20:44,527 --> 00:20:46,963
they're responsible enough
for the life of an animal

419
00:20:46,964 --> 00:20:51,993
should certainly be able to construct
a roof for the ratty little thing.

420
00:20:52,204 --> 00:20:55,230
All right, I'll make it.
I'll make it right now.

421
00:21:06,751 --> 00:21:08,218
What is that?

422
00:21:09,753 --> 00:21:12,220
"What is that?" It's the
doghouse. No, it's not.

423
00:21:12,221 --> 00:21:13,516
What are you talking about?

424
00:21:13,517 --> 00:21:15,387
I gave you specifications.

425
00:21:15,893 --> 00:21:18,156
When?
When I gave you the job.

426
00:21:19,796 --> 00:21:21,126
In 1989?

427
00:21:21,127 --> 00:21:24,860
Shawn, you know as well as I
do this is not what I asked for.

428
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,267
Keep working.
Don't be too loud.

429
00:21:28,804 --> 00:21:30,999
The neighbors are
trying to sleep.

430
00:22:06,728 --> 00:22:08,326
You expect me to
be okay with this?

431
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,428
I worked hard on it.

432
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:11,336
Shawn, you've been at this
for hours now.

433
00:22:11,337 --> 00:22:12,897
The nails aren't
pounded in all the way,

434
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:14,442
the base has gotta be
up off the ground.

435
00:22:14,443 --> 00:22:16,602
If it rains, the rain's
gonna flow right in.

436
00:22:16,603 --> 00:22:17,975
And who's gonna fit in
through that door?

437
00:22:17,976 --> 00:22:19,445
That door's not high enough.

438
00:22:19,446 --> 00:22:21,812
I built it, Dad,
what do you want me to do?

439
00:22:21,813 --> 00:22:23,749
I want you to do it right.

440
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:53,502
Listen, Dr. Sloane, if I can get
you this product this afternoon,

441
00:22:53,503 --> 00:22:57,275
would it be possible to sit
down with you to discuss the...

442
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,589
<i>M- A...</i>

443
00:23:01,986 --> 00:23:05,387
The unbelievable results
we've been having...

444
00:23:08,792 --> 00:23:10,156
<i>...O...</i>

445
00:23:10,157 --> 00:23:12,319
I'm sorry.
Can I call you back?

446
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,624
Thanks.

447
00:23:22,304 --> 00:23:24,703
Burton Guster. Shawn?

448
00:23:25,773 --> 00:23:27,604
You're in the hospital?

449
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:29,435
What happened?

450
00:23:29,811 --> 00:23:31,072
You call your dad?

451
00:23:31,073 --> 00:23:33,111
I'm fine.
They're releasing me.

452
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:34,647
Did you call him?

453
00:23:35,649 --> 00:23:37,741
Gus, I am not gonna
talk to my dad.

454
00:23:37,742 --> 00:23:39,580
He'd wanna know
you're okay.

455
00:23:39,581 --> 00:23:41,846
All he cares about
are results.

456
00:23:41,847 --> 00:23:44,913
Just like those possessed
spelling bee parents.

457
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:48,119
You know what's wrong
with this? All of this.

458
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:50,316
Shawn, you're delirious.
You're upset.

459
00:23:50,317 --> 00:23:52,795
You lost control of
your bike last night.

460
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:55,655
Gus, I didn't lose
control of anything.

461
00:23:55,656 --> 00:23:59,190
Someone tried to kill me or
send a very serious message.

462
00:24:02,206 --> 00:24:03,934
Brendan appreciates you
checking on him.

463
00:24:03,935 --> 00:24:05,234
Well, we were in
the neighborhood.

464
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,538
And, Gus here
is a huge fan.

465
00:24:07,877 --> 00:24:10,505
He almost won the
spelling bee himself.

466
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,880
I took some bad advice.

467
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,344
Well, Brendan's
going home tomorrow.

468
00:24:20,345 --> 00:24:21,820
He's fine.

469
00:24:21,821 --> 00:24:24,517
He's more upset about
missing the spelling bee.

470
00:24:25,226 --> 00:24:28,389
Well, maybe they'll decide
to redo the whole thing.

471
00:24:29,263 --> 00:24:30,855
Why'd they do that?

472
00:24:33,233 --> 00:24:34,790
Did you see the inhaler?

473
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:36,357
Same one as that
little Czech kid?

474
00:24:36,358 --> 00:24:37,459
Get me a seating chart.

475
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,834
I'll bet you I know who Brendan
was sitting next to on day one.

476
00:24:39,835 --> 00:24:41,371
I already checked it out.
Nice!

477
00:24:41,372 --> 00:24:44,135
Shawn, something's going
on with that Czech kid.

478
00:24:44,136 --> 00:24:47,109
Talk to me. The doctor on his
inhaler, Dr. Zavin, in Ventura?

479
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,668
Yeah?
He doesn't exist.

480
00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:51,976
I do training on that route. The
last doctor in the book is Youngerman.

481
00:24:51,977 --> 00:24:53,572
I double-checked it today.

482
00:24:53,573 --> 00:24:55,845
You're saying that inhaler...

483
00:24:55,846 --> 00:24:57,251
Is a fake.

484
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:00,812
Where you going?

485
00:25:00,813 --> 00:25:04,418
I am going to build
a doghouse!

486
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:12,963
I thought you gave up.

487
00:25:13,202 --> 00:25:15,795
Yeah, well, it doesn't
appear so, huh?

488
00:25:17,238 --> 00:25:18,226
What happened to your leg?

489
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:20,035
Absolutely nothing.

490
00:25:20,275 --> 00:25:23,243
You're running your roofing
vertical there, huh?

491
00:25:23,244 --> 00:25:24,299
Yeah.

492
00:25:25,078 --> 00:25:27,375
You might wanna pop
a ridge beam in first.

493
00:25:27,376 --> 00:25:30,746
Well, yeah, that's a given.

494
00:25:43,929 --> 00:25:45,259
What the hell
are you doing?

495
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,991
I'm gonna help you.

496
00:25:47,566 --> 00:25:49,589
You've never helped me
before, ever.

497
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,259
You've never asked.

498
00:25:52,536 --> 00:25:54,060
Put a nail in here.

499
00:25:57,508 --> 00:26:00,169
All right. This is weird.

500
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:08,777
No, thanks.

501
00:26:19,226 --> 00:26:20,352
Not bad.

502
00:26:21,417 --> 00:26:22,859
"Not bad"?

503
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,919
It's like the Park Hyatt
for poodles.

504
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,023
Will you call Jack Syklan?

505
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,935
What is this?
Your results.

506
00:26:29,936 --> 00:26:31,799
We had an agreement.

507
00:26:32,438 --> 00:26:34,928
This is a derivative of methyl
parathion. High-grade stuff.

508
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:37,839
Whatever you're into,
I want you to get out quick.

509
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,571
I'm not kidding.

510
00:26:43,748 --> 00:26:46,341
Wait a sec. How did you
get this so quickly?

511
00:26:46,342 --> 00:26:49,214
Hmm? Oh, Syklan's a part
of my poker game.

512
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,249
So you didn't even
have to call him?

513
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,415
That game was at his house.

514
00:26:55,025 --> 00:26:57,618
And I did all of that
for nothing?

515
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,361
For nothing? Shawn, you've never
completed a thing in your life.

516
00:27:04,233 --> 00:27:05,666
Now you have.

517
00:27:15,876 --> 00:27:16,967
Poisoned?

518
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,511
I feel somebody
poisoned his food.

519
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,070
There is a

520
00:27:22,483 --> 00:27:25,781
Styrofoam container, yes,
and a...

521
00:27:29,989 --> 00:27:32,422
"Happiness is a golden poem."
What?

522
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:34,288
A fortune cookie!

523
00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:35,586
This is ridiculous.
Is it?

524
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:39,721
Mr. Spencer, what we have now points
to a medical condition, not murder.

525
00:27:39,722 --> 00:27:42,890
All appearances show Mr. Cavanaugh
having an anaphylactic reaction.

526
00:27:42,891 --> 00:27:46,925
Not to be out of line, but that could
be triggered by several types of poisons.

527
00:27:46,926 --> 00:27:48,129
Or altered medications.

528
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,898
Or shellfish, which
he was allergic to.

529
00:27:49,899 --> 00:27:52,873
Those results will show up
in the toxicology report,

530
00:27:52,874 --> 00:27:54,966
which we will have a copy of
in approximately two weeks.

531
00:27:54,967 --> 00:27:56,568
No, no, no!
That'll be too late.

532
00:27:56,569 --> 00:27:58,636
All the contestants
will be gone...

533
00:28:00,182 --> 00:28:01,274
Home.

534
00:28:02,184 --> 00:28:05,050
You won't be able to finish
a real investigation.

535
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:07,713
Chief, I sense this!

536
00:28:08,189 --> 00:28:09,314
Look, something
got out of control

537
00:28:09,315 --> 00:28:11,880
and the perpetrator was
willing to kill to cover it up!

538
00:28:11,881 --> 00:28:13,858
What proof do you have?

539
00:28:21,601 --> 00:28:23,227
Only what I feel.

540
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:25,267
Why are you still
listening to this crap?

541
00:28:25,268 --> 00:28:26,598
Dude, what is your glitch?

542
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:28,639
You! You're my glitch!

543
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,607
Look, he got nowhere with his
little inhaler assignment,

544
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,972
and then he tells the media
that we had a murder scene!

545
00:28:32,973 --> 00:28:34,841
Cut him loose, Karen!

546
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:42,679
I mean, do whatever you
think is best, Chief.

547
00:28:43,821 --> 00:28:46,618
Mr. Cavanaugh was gonna make an
announcement. What about that?

548
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:48,451
The Director said he'd
recently spoken of retiring.

549
00:28:48,452 --> 00:28:49,683
That's not what
he was gonna say.

550
00:28:49,684 --> 00:28:51,055
Oh, you know?

551
00:28:51,056 --> 00:28:52,150
I know.

552
00:28:52,151 --> 00:28:55,685
Mr. Spencer, I asked you to check
in about the inhaler incident.

553
00:28:55,686 --> 00:28:57,162
If you or your partner
have anything about that,

554
00:28:57,163 --> 00:28:59,199
I'd be happy
to hear about it.

555
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,495
Otherwise...

556
00:29:08,442 --> 00:29:10,432
We gotta get back into
the spellmaster's room.

557
00:29:10,433 --> 00:29:11,909
Are you serious?
Gus, the killer was there!

558
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,845
There's gotta be some other
piece of evidence inside.

559
00:29:15,181 --> 00:29:17,648
We're not gonna have
time to get in there.

560
00:29:17,649 --> 00:29:18,910
Besides, it's locked.

561
00:29:18,911 --> 00:29:20,316
We'll make it work.

562
00:29:21,187 --> 00:29:22,585
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

563
00:29:22,855 --> 00:29:25,049
How hard is it to get into
this event without a ticket?

564
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,523
Impossible.

565
00:29:27,493 --> 00:29:30,257
The new spellmaster.
Check it out.

566
00:29:31,162 --> 00:29:33,653
It's exactly what
I was hoping you'd say.

567
00:29:37,335 --> 00:29:38,426
You can't do
that to him!

568
00:29:38,427 --> 00:29:42,063
Gus, he has to learn sometime
that smoking is bad for him.

569
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,932
We're picking it up
as a new round commences.

570
00:29:46,933 --> 00:29:48,441
A lot of excitement
in the air. Ooh, yeah.

571
00:29:48,442 --> 00:29:50,672
The tension is becoming
butyraceous, Bud.

572
00:30:00,655 --> 00:30:03,749
I'm so sorry if my agonizing
pain is inconveniencing you.

573
00:30:11,965 --> 00:30:13,363
What's this?

574
00:30:14,567 --> 00:30:16,967
It's a mark on a carpet.
Let's go.

575
00:30:17,303 --> 00:30:19,031
Someone must have
heard that.

576
00:30:19,032 --> 00:30:21,936
<i>Thirty seconds. Live
to air. Positions, please.</i>

577
00:30:21,937 --> 00:30:23,338
Time's up, Shawn.

578
00:30:24,776 --> 00:30:26,710
Did you hear me, Shawn?

579
00:30:29,481 --> 00:30:30,970
I've got something!

580
00:30:35,886 --> 00:30:36,875
Yes!

581
00:30:38,688 --> 00:30:40,656
<i>Ten seconds.
Prepare the next word.</i>

582
00:30:41,057 --> 00:30:42,114
That can't be right.

583
00:30:42,115 --> 00:30:43,658
It doesn't mean anything,
Shawn, let's go.

584
00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:48,287
<i>Broadcast in five,
four, three, two...</i>

585
00:30:48,997 --> 00:30:50,395
Maybe this direction.

586
00:30:50,396 --> 00:30:52,626
<i>Hello? We need the word now.</i>

587
00:30:53,836 --> 00:30:55,598
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

588
00:30:57,104 --> 00:30:59,538
<i>Leann, something's wrong,
send security.</i>

589
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:03,605
No, sorry for the delay.

590
00:31:04,411 --> 00:31:05,570
Give me a word!
A word?

591
00:31:05,571 --> 00:31:07,271
Yeah! Something hard,
but something you can spell.

592
00:31:07,272 --> 00:31:10,145
I can spell anything.
Except "aggiornamento."

593
00:31:10,884 --> 00:31:11,907
Give me one!
No!

594
00:31:11,908 --> 00:31:13,007
You are not gonna
be spellmaster!

595
00:31:13,008 --> 00:31:15,918
Gus, give me a word so we can
get out of here! We're so close!

596
00:31:16,889 --> 00:31:18,982
<i>Is everything okay up there?</i>

597
00:31:20,259 --> 00:31:21,589
It's fine.

598
00:31:22,961 --> 00:31:24,223
"Banana."

599
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:29,689
<i>Can you repeat that?</i>

600
00:31:30,367 --> 00:31:31,459
<i>Yes.</i>

601
00:31:32,369 --> 00:31:33,734
<i>"Banana."</i>

602
00:31:35,205 --> 00:31:37,069
"Banana," Shawn?
This is the third round!

603
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,196
You could have helped me!

604
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:40,605
This is a dead end, Shawn,
we're walking. Let's go!

605
00:31:40,606 --> 00:31:42,507
<i>Definition, please?</i>

606
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:44,205
What?

607
00:31:47,837 --> 00:31:49,349
<i>A yellow fruit.</i>

608
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:52,044
<i>Also, a kind of pudding.</i>

609
00:31:52,854 --> 00:31:54,651
<i>A delicious pudding.</i>

610
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:56,555
<i>Sentence, please?</i>

611
00:32:00,094 --> 00:32:04,792
<i>"Anna Banana would like
to hear Venus by Bananarama. "</i>

612
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,559
<i>"Banana."</i>

613
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,659
<i>B- A-N-A-N-A. Banana.</i>

614
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,908
Oh, wait a second,
I've got something!

615
00:32:19,077 --> 00:32:21,236
Dude, we got him!
He was watching the Czech.

616
00:32:21,237 --> 00:32:22,505
Let me see.

617
00:32:22,506 --> 00:32:24,707
<i>We need to get
the next word.</i>

618
00:32:25,816 --> 00:32:27,248
Give me a word.
No!

619
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:28,375
You're ruining
the whole event!

620
00:32:28,376 --> 00:32:29,941
Suit yourself.

621
00:32:30,687 --> 00:32:31,881
<i>"Onion."</i>

622
00:32:32,589 --> 00:32:33,817
"Onion?"

623
00:32:34,491 --> 00:32:35,650
<i>"Onion?"</i>

624
00:32:35,651 --> 00:32:36,919
"Onion?"

625
00:32:37,227 --> 00:32:39,455
Even Dan Quayle
could spell that.

626
00:32:39,456 --> 00:32:41,462
<i>O- N-l-O-N. Onion.</i>

627
00:32:46,968 --> 00:32:48,696
<i>Are we off the list, Bill?</i>

628
00:32:48,697 --> 00:32:50,635
No, everything's fine.

629
00:32:51,673 --> 00:32:52,969
You're using
his grocery list!

630
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,904
You refused to help me!

631
00:32:54,905 --> 00:32:57,205
Now I gotta give them
something else.

632
00:32:59,046 --> 00:33:00,445
<i>"Mitchum."</i>

633
00:33:04,417 --> 00:33:06,248
<i>"Mitchum"?
Yes.</i>

634
00:33:06,786 --> 00:33:11,950
<i>"When I go to Albertsons, I need
to buy some Mitchum Ice Blast. "</i>

635
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,028
<i>"And bananas."</i>

636
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:20,593
That wasn't me!
I was locked outside.

637
00:33:20,594 --> 00:33:22,959
I have a reputation
to uphold!

638
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:28,102
So he was watching the Czech,
we have no proof.

639
00:33:28,103 --> 00:33:29,831
There was no film
in the camera!

640
00:33:29,832 --> 00:33:33,466
He was using that lens for something
else besides taking pictures. Now, what?

641
00:33:33,467 --> 00:33:35,339
Cavanaugh was known for
ferreting out rule breakers.

642
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,434
He once caught a kid stealing
the advance word list.

643
00:33:37,435 --> 00:33:39,673
And everything he did
had a purpose.

644
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:52,188
You couldn't have grabbed
one of these five minute ago?

645
00:33:56,029 --> 00:33:58,326
<i>We're down to
the final two spellers.</i>

646
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:01,264
<i>This has been a hard-fought
battle right from the start!</i>

647
00:34:01,265 --> 00:34:03,493
<i>We've had tragedy,
controversy,</i>

648
00:34:03,494 --> 00:34:07,129
<i>but when it really mattered, these
kids put together a fantastic display</i>

649
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,537
<i>of the power of learning.</i>

650
00:34:09,869 --> 00:34:13,308
Look at this. Brendan Vu
went down on "gladiolus."

651
00:34:13,978 --> 00:34:15,002
So?

652
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,915
So? If I'd been able to see any of
the competition, I could have told you

653
00:34:18,916 --> 00:34:22,610
that was the winning word from
the first spelling bee in 1929.

654
00:34:22,611 --> 00:34:24,778
Okay, you're
scaring me again.

655
00:34:25,589 --> 00:34:28,818
All of these words from that
round were the winning words.

656
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:32,153
They do that once in a while,
they make it a theme round.

657
00:34:32,154 --> 00:34:34,321
This one won the 1985 bee,

658
00:34:35,431 --> 00:34:36,953
<i>this one from 1943.</i>

659
00:34:36,954 --> 00:34:38,863
Gus, what are
you saying?

660
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:42,795
Guess which kid got
the winning word from 1953?

661
00:34:44,939 --> 00:34:46,963
You're staring at his father.

662
00:34:51,845 --> 00:34:54,311
Gus, that's who Cavanaugh
was gonna disqualify.

663
00:34:54,312 --> 00:34:56,279
That's what he was
tracking in the rulebook!

664
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,906
1953! It was 1953.

665
00:34:57,907 --> 00:35:00,612
<i>Jiri Prochazka,
you have the next word.</i>

666
00:35:00,853 --> 00:35:02,410
<i>"Mastoparietal."</i>

667
00:35:04,322 --> 00:35:06,016
<i>Part of speech?</i>

668
00:35:06,017 --> 00:35:07,854
<i>It is an adjective.</i>

669
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,785
<i>Could I
have the definition?</i>

670
00:35:10,786 --> 00:35:11,986
<i>Yes.</i>

671
00:35:11,987 --> 00:35:15,589
<i>"Relating to the mastoid
portion of the temporal bone,</i>

672
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,395
<i>"and to the parietal lobe."</i>

673
00:35:24,607 --> 00:35:25,733
<i>M...</i>

674
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,349
<i>...A-S-T...</i>

675
00:35:32,848 --> 00:35:33,648
<i>...O-P-A-R-I...</i>

676
00:35:39,654 --> 00:35:41,814
I got him.
Let's call the Chief.

677
00:35:41,815 --> 00:35:47,086
<i>And this year's winner of the
Central California Regionals</i>

678
00:35:47,087 --> 00:35:49,754
<i>is Jiri Prochazka!</i>

679
00:35:58,804 --> 00:36:02,101
Move out, people, this is what
you came to see, right here.

680
00:36:02,102 --> 00:36:03,800
This is it! Yes!

681
00:36:05,643 --> 00:36:08,134
This competition meant
everything to Miklous!

682
00:36:10,214 --> 00:36:13,512
Oh, boy! Gus!
Gus, here we go!

683
00:36:13,513 --> 00:36:15,176
Gus, it's happening!

684
00:36:24,694 --> 00:36:27,094
I know who killed
Elvin Cavanaugh.

685
00:36:27,829 --> 00:36:30,490
Can't he ever just tell
us to arrest someone?

686
00:36:30,491 --> 00:36:31,861
He does this a lot?

687
00:36:31,862 --> 00:36:32,956
Yes.

688
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:37,402
I'm sorry. I'm kind of a slave
to my visions. I'm a slave.

689
00:36:37,738 --> 00:36:38,863
Do you want me
to cuff him?

690
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:40,804
Why would I want that?

691
00:36:41,542 --> 00:36:43,203
Just a suggestion.

692
00:36:43,611 --> 00:36:46,579
They just sort of come
when they wanna come, and...

693
00:36:46,846 --> 00:36:47,972
Jiri.

694
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,308
Spell "soubrette."

695
00:36:53,652 --> 00:36:55,118
Why is this man speaking?

696
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,813
You can't, can you?

697
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:59,119
Not without help
from your dad.

698
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:02,614
And that's not a
real inhaler, is it?

699
00:37:02,615 --> 00:37:04,854
This is crazy, this...
This...

700
00:37:10,066 --> 00:37:12,864
<i>Cheating was
Cavanaugh's obsession.</i>

701
00:37:13,336 --> 00:37:16,168
He was gonna expose you
as a cheater.

702
00:37:16,169 --> 00:37:18,172
He was gonna disqualify Jiri,
and you knew it,

703
00:37:18,173 --> 00:37:19,831
and you couldn't
let that happen.

704
00:37:19,832 --> 00:37:22,139
You had way too much
to lose.

705
00:37:22,745 --> 00:37:24,609
<i>You slipped into the box.</i>

706
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,874
<i>You knew his comfort
was food!</i>

707
00:37:27,982 --> 00:37:30,143
<i>He was dangerously unhealthy!</i>

708
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:38,753
He's starting
to go into shock.

709
00:37:40,594 --> 00:37:42,185
You knew he wouldn't
stop the bee!

710
00:37:42,186 --> 00:37:44,092
He never stops the bee!

711
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:46,898
By the end of the round,
it was too late!

712
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:50,133
Too dizzy to walk,
he stumbles...

713
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,631
He tumbles over the rail,

714
00:37:58,877 --> 00:38:01,367
<i>Crashes
onto the chairs below.</i>

715
00:38:05,115 --> 00:38:06,980
<i>And there goes
the evidence.</i>

716
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:10,550
Except for one thing.

717
00:38:13,189 --> 00:38:14,247
That inhaler.

718
00:38:15,858 --> 00:38:18,087
It sends electronic signals!

719
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,086
The transmitter
is in your jacket.

720
00:38:20,087 --> 00:38:22,858
You sent the signals from
the audience to the stage.

721
00:38:23,298 --> 00:38:26,857
And I bet at your home,
we'll find the van

722
00:38:26,858 --> 00:38:30,802
that ran me off the road
when I alerted the police!

723
00:38:32,406 --> 00:38:35,862
Dangerous cocktail,
unforgiving poisons.

724
00:38:35,863 --> 00:38:37,603
You don't need it.

725
00:38:38,345 --> 00:38:39,709
I took your advice.

726
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:43,043
I ran the Chinese food through
the lab, nothing's definite.

727
00:38:43,044 --> 00:38:44,547
I'm sorry.

728
00:38:44,548 --> 00:38:46,710
He just seemed sure.
I took a shot.

729
00:38:50,856 --> 00:38:52,755
I'll take it from here.

730
00:39:07,404 --> 00:39:08,870
I could've won
that thing.

731
00:39:10,132 --> 00:39:12,105
Yeah, you could've.

732
00:39:12,106 --> 00:39:14,299
Thank the Lord
you didn't.

733
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,638
What is that supposed
to mean?

734
00:39:17,179 --> 00:39:18,270
Oh, Gus.

735
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:22,140
The guy who wins?
Saddled forever as,

736
00:39:22,617 --> 00:39:25,586
you know, the dude that
won the spelling bee.

737
00:39:25,819 --> 00:39:27,786
I'm sure you would've
dealt with it later,

738
00:39:27,787 --> 00:39:30,322
but kids, high school
kids, especially,

739
00:39:30,323 --> 00:39:32,484
they're just ruthless,
judgmental.

740
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,550
Horrible little bastards.

741
00:39:34,551 --> 00:39:36,719
You wouldn't have been
able to date a cheerleader.

742
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,263
They wouldn't have invited
you to any parties.

743
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,320
You'd have been
the object of ridicule.

744
00:39:40,321 --> 00:39:43,390
I mean, this way, you got to
be a smart kid and a cool kid.

745
00:39:43,391 --> 00:39:44,559
Best of both worlds.

746
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,933
That's true.
I appreciate that, Shawn.

747
00:39:46,934 --> 00:39:48,995
Yeah, it's a nice balance.

748
00:39:48,996 --> 00:39:51,667
That's why I had to
give you the wrong letter.

749
00:39:54,211 --> 00:39:56,178
You knew that was wrong?

750
00:39:56,179 --> 00:39:58,976
Oh, come on, Gus.
"Aggiornamento"?

751
00:39:58,977 --> 00:40:01,244
Everybody knew
it was an "I".

752
00:40:03,753 --> 00:40:05,720
All right, you hold on.

753
00:40:05,721 --> 00:40:07,187
You were happy
one second ago.

754
00:40:07,188 --> 00:40:09,416
I was about to win!
I studied for three months.

755
00:40:09,417 --> 00:40:12,254
Yeah, and you would have kept
studying forever and ever!

756
00:40:12,255 --> 00:40:14,228
All the way till Nationals!

757
00:40:16,632 --> 00:40:18,427
But you're upset now,
I can see that.

758
00:40:18,428 --> 00:40:19,522
But you'll be fine
with it later.

759
00:40:19,523 --> 00:40:20,793
You know what that did to me?

760
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:23,199
Yes, yes, I do. We
went out the next night,

761
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,295
and you were so flustered that
you threw caution to the wind,

762
00:40:26,296 --> 00:40:29,239
and you hooked up with Melinda
Castleberg! It was nice!

763
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,708
Come here, Shawn!
At least I was honest.

764
00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:33,006
Come here!

765
00:40:46,791 --> 00:40:49,191
Ah, Shawn, what a coincidence.

766
00:40:49,794 --> 00:40:50,986
Yeah, I was just reading
the newspaper,

767
00:40:50,987 --> 00:40:54,962
a little article that sounded
very familiar about a spelling bee.

768
00:40:54,963 --> 00:40:56,590
Thanks for the help, Dad.

769
00:40:57,167 --> 00:40:58,997
Police ever get
that evidence?

770
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,298
Yeah, a funny little bird
tipped them off.

771
00:41:03,139 --> 00:41:04,230
Leg doing better?

772
00:41:04,231 --> 00:41:06,935
It's getting there,
doesn't hurt so bad.

773
00:41:10,345 --> 00:41:14,372
Listen, Dad, the thing
about the house, the dog,

774
00:41:14,583 --> 00:41:15,571
it was kind of a big deal.

775
00:41:15,572 --> 00:41:17,878
And I know I held a grudge
about it for a while.

776
00:41:17,879 --> 00:41:20,216
But I think
you were right.

777
00:41:22,156 --> 00:41:25,921
A dog needs a house, and a
doghouse needs an occupant,

778
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,624
so as a token of
my appreciation,

779
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:30,822
I left you
a little something.

780
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,425
Sincerely,

781
00:41:32,732 --> 00:41:33,823
thanks.

782
00:41:38,437 --> 00:41:41,667
Shawn. Shawn!
No. No way!

783
00:41:41,668 --> 00:41:43,205
Enjoy, Dad.

784
00:41:43,206 --> 00:41:45,571
Shawn, you gotta take
this thing with you!

785
00:41:45,572 --> 00:41:47,974
You kidding? There's no pets
allowed in my apartment!

786
00:41:47,975 --> 00:41:50,511
I'm gonna stick it
on the street, Shawn!

787
00:41:50,512 --> 00:41:52,342
I swear I'm gonna stick...
Shawn!

788
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,213
Shawn!

789
00:41:55,085 --> 00:41:56,745
He's not gonna keep
that thing, you know.

790
00:41:56,746 --> 00:41:58,549
It's my neighbor's dog.

791
00:41:58,755 --> 00:41:59,811
Shawn!
Take a lap around the block.

792
00:41:59,812 --> 00:42:01,856
Let him stew a little bit. I'm
gonna take it, and I'm gonna go,

793
00:42:01,857 --> 00:42:03,447
and I'm gonna
stick it on the street!

794
00:42:03,448 --> 00:42:05,790
Shawn! Shawn!

795
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:18,865
<i>In between the lines
there's a lot of obscurity</i>

796
00:42:18,866 --> 00:42:22,305
<i>I'm not inclined
to resign to maturity</i>

797
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:25,468
<i>If it's all right
then you're all wrong</i>

798
00:42:25,469 --> 00:42:29,174
<i>But why bounce around
to the same damn song?</i>

799
00:42:30,149 --> 00:42:34,278
<i>You'd rather run
when you can't crawl</i>

800
00:42:36,588 --> 00:42:40,045
<i>I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth</i>

801
00:42:40,046 --> 00:42:43,183
<i>I know, you know
They just don't have any proof</i>

802
00:42:43,184 --> 00:42:46,285
<i>Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend</i>

803
00:42:46,286 --> 00:42:50,627
<i>Your worst inhibitions tend
to psych you out in the end</i>

804
00:42:50,628 --> 00:42:52,258
<i>I know, you know</i>

805
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:55,728
<i>I know, you know</i>
