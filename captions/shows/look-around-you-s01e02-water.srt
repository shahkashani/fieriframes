1
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,837
Look around you.

2
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,120
Look around you.

3
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,590
Just look around you.

4
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,156
Have you worked out
what we're looking for?

5
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,960
Correct. The answer is...

6
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,757
This programme, "Water",

7
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,389
is discussed in chapter 1
of your textbook,

8
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,671
which accompanies this series.

9
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,480
Please ensure that you have
your copybook at hand,

10
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,474
as you'll be asked
to take down notes from the screen

11
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,200
at various points
throughout the programme.

12
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,919
Water.

13
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,073
Delicious, refreshing water.

14
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,477
From ocean, to sea,
to lake, to pool,

15
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,395
to pond, to puddle,
to drop, to drip.

16
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,510
Water, chemical symbol
H twenty, is all around us.

17
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,149
It's the giver of life.

18
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,677
And it's there with us from our
first cup of tea in the morning...

19
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,756
.. to our nightly Bithuvy.

20
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,110
But what is water?

21
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,354
It's a difficult question, because
water is impossible to describe.

22
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,910
One might ask the same about birds.

23
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,117
What are birds?

24
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,556
We just don' t know.

25
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,431
But we do know that water is the
most powerful substance on earth.

26
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,640
And whatever form it's in,
be it ice,

27
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,280
vapour

28
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,394
or just water,

29
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,952
it is capable of affecting whatever
it comes into contact with.

30
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,917
Ruined.

31
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,991
An experiment was carried out

32
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,074
to demonstrate the effects
of boiling water upon proteins.

33
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,230
A quantity of water
is heated over a Bunsen

34
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,395
until it reaches its boiling point
of one thousand degrees.

35
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,197
Now we take our sample of protein.

36
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,829
For the purposes of this
experiment, we're using an egg.

37
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,076
Next, the egg is placed carefully
into the beaker.

38
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,512
Let's see what happens to the egg

39
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,195
after it's been in
the boiling water for one minute.

40
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,277
The scientist removes the egg

41
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,878
and examines
its interior consistency.

42
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,471
From the state of the albumen,

43
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,792
we can see that the protein
has hardly reacted

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,117
to the intense heat of the water.

45
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,598
Let's try another egg,
this time for two minutes.

46
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,117
Make sure you look out for
the release of the new albumen.

47
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,476
It's out now!

48
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,552
The protein is beginning to react.

49
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,992
We try a further egg,
this time for three minutes.

50
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,871
Now let's take a look
inside the third egg.

51
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,360
The heat of the water

52
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,878
has caused the molecular structure
of the protein to coagulate.

53
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,151
In other words,
not too runny, not too hard.

54
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,312
A perfect eggy.

55
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,432
Salt is added to taste.

56
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,990
And breakfast is served.

57
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,796
Write that down
in your copybook now.

58
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,917
When rain freezes,

59
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,510
it becomes snow.

60
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,990
Snow's main use, of course,
is for entertainment.

61
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,314
Here's a modern snowman.

62
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,154
Batteries have been used
for the eyes,

63
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,075
an aerial for the nose,
and a calculator for the mouth.

64
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,519
Hello.

65
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,797
(MECHANICAL VOICE) Hello.

66
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,593
But it's not just man
that uses frozen water.

67
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,600
These ants have been trained
to design and build an igloo,

68
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,195
using tiny blocks of ice.

69
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,437
Once the igloo is complete,

70
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,956
the ants take a well-deserved rest.

71
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,800
We'll come back to the ants later.

72
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,031
In the meantime, thanks, ants.

73
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,953
An experiment was carried out

74
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,750
to determine the effects
of nitrogen gas upon water.

75
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,918
First, a sample of water was taken.

76
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,070
Next, a Jane Grey's Pipe is fitted

77
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,835
to the nozzle
of a canister of nitrogen.

78
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,349
The Jane Grey is placed
in the beaker of water.

79
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,353
We're using
about 10 pence worth of gas.

80
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,831
Now we turn on the canister
to release nitrogen.

81
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,871
The gas mafipulates gently through
the Jane Grey and into the water,

82
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,997
causing bubbling.

83
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,949
The mafipulation is allowed
to continue for five minutes.

84
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,080
When the time is up,
we turn off the gas.

85
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,358
And free the Jane Grey
from the beaker.

86
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,876
(HARPSICHORD MUSIC)

87
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,520
Now let's take a look
at our water sample.

88
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,036
If you look carefully,

89
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:39,320
you'll see the water has changed
colour from invisible to brown.

90
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,156
What we have produced
is Embenzalmine nitrotomine,

91
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,279
more commonly known...as whiskey.

92
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,238
Whiskey is a pleasant-tasting,
thirst-quenching drink,

93
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,471
and it's enjoyed by all.

94
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,552
Now let's rejoin the ants

95
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,878
and see how
they're settling into their igloo.

96
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,270
A change has taken place.

97
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,319
The igloo appears to have melted.

98
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,671
Perhaps the scientist
forgot to turn off a Bunsen.

99
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,552
Water, water,

100
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,791
what hast thou donst?

101
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,952
Bless you, ants.

102
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,192
(CRASH)

103
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,759
Now hand in your copybook
to your teacher or head of class.

104
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,400
In the next programme,
we will look at romance.
