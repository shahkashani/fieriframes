1
00:01:27,944 --> 00:01:29,177
What about a composer?

2
00:01:29,643 --> 00:01:32,075
I am not, uh, Irving Berlin.

3
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,874
More classical than that?

4
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:35,440
No, I am not Berlioz.

5
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,472
Another one.

6
00:01:36,572 --> 00:01:37,738
I am not Brahms.

7
00:01:37,938 --> 00:01:39,371
Are you a famous New York conductor?

8
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,369
No, I am not Leonard Bernstein.

9
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:42,802
Are you a famous murderer?

10
00:01:43,101 --> 00:01:45,267
Good try, I am not Lizzie Borden.

11
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,398
I hope you stump him, darling,
because I am running out of B's.

12
00:01:48,498 --> 00:01:53,494
All right, are you a well known
18th century English jurist?

13
00:01:53,695 --> 00:01:55,127
Typical lawyer's question, Burt.

14
00:01:55,227 --> 00:01:57,892
No, I'm not Sir William Blackstone...
Cynthia.

15
00:01:58,025 --> 00:01:58,892
I pass.

16
00:01:59,124 --> 00:02:02,789
You know, every time we play Botticelli
with you I feel like a dropout.

17
00:02:02,955 --> 00:02:05,187
Do I see the flutter of white flags?

18
00:02:05,853 --> 00:02:07,153
Go ahead...tell us who it is.

19
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:09,018
No, no, no, please!
Let's keep guessing.

20
00:02:09,152 --> 00:02:10,617
We'll be here all night.

21
00:02:10,717 --> 00:02:11,750
Come on, Ray.

22
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:13,648
It's very simple...Josef Breuer.

23
00:02:13,748 --> 00:02:14,481
Who?

24
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:17,680
Breuer. He and Freud co-authored
"Studies on Hysteria."

25
00:02:17,912 --> 00:02:20,411
That's unfair! Dr.Flemming,
you're a psychiatrist.

26
00:02:20,511 --> 00:02:22,476
You should've picked someone
everyone knew.

27
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:23,442
Well, like who, honey?

28
00:02:23,842 --> 00:02:27,806
Last time we played the game you were
stumped by Alexander Graham Bell.

29
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:31,337
Has my husband finished dazzling you
with his intelligence?

30
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:35,168
Because I have a little surprise for
everyone. Everyone ready?

31
00:02:51,392 --> 00:02:54,256
Henri at the Denise found out about
our anniversary.

32
00:02:54,356 --> 00:02:55,622
He insisted.

33
00:02:55,722 --> 00:02:57,887
I insist we get at this while
it's cold.

34
00:03:00,052 --> 00:03:02,451
I think a toast is in order.

35
00:03:03,084 --> 00:03:05,249
To our host and hostess...

36
00:03:05,548 --> 00:03:08,780
On the tenth anniversary of their
horrible mistake.

37
00:03:09,346 --> 00:03:11,245
You'd better rephrase that, counselor.

38
00:03:11,345 --> 00:03:12,645
Pleasure, your honor...

39
00:03:13,278 --> 00:03:15,476
To the two finest people I ever knew.

40
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:17,907
Here's to ten more years of happiness.

41
00:03:25,236 --> 00:03:26,003
Excuse me.

42
00:03:31,366 --> 00:03:32,132
Hello?

43
00:03:34,397 --> 00:03:35,230
Now?

44
00:03:36,663 --> 00:03:37,528
Can't it wait?

45
00:03:41,059 --> 00:03:42,659
We're having a party here.

46
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,689
I'll be there as soon as I can.

47
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,719
Believe me, anything Henri chooses is
superb.

48
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:55,883
He's got the best wine cellar in town.

49
00:03:58,049 --> 00:03:59,148
Excuse me.

50
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:05,677
What is it darling?

51
00:04:06,344 --> 00:04:08,009
It's a patient.
I'm afraid I have to leave.

52
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:09,442
This is our anniversary.

53
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,173
But it's an emergency.
He's having an anxiety attack.

54
00:04:12,273 --> 00:04:14,072
You're not a family doctor.

55
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:15,705
You don't have to go chasing off...

56
00:04:15,804 --> 00:04:17,803
...every time somebody runs out of
tranquilizers.

57
00:04:17,903 --> 00:04:19,369
Darling, we've been through this
before...

58
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,134
I won't allow you to leave.
We have guests...

59
00:04:21,235 --> 00:04:22,766
And they shouldn't see us arguing,
should they?

60
00:04:23,865 --> 00:04:26,564
Make my excuses. I'll try to get back
before they leave.

61
00:04:47,017 --> 00:04:48,183
Do you love me?

62
00:04:51,415 --> 00:04:52,415
How much?

63
00:04:52,781 --> 00:04:53,813
This much...

64
00:05:09,937 --> 00:05:12,035
Well, actually, I should be strangling
you.

65
00:05:12,135 --> 00:05:13,068
Why?

66
00:05:13,234 --> 00:05:14,967
You know I was giving a party.

67
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:16,799
I had to see you...

68
00:05:17,631 --> 00:05:21,296
When I'm alone...I don't know,
I...I get confused.

69
00:05:21,895 --> 00:05:23,061
Second thoughts?

70
00:05:23,794 --> 00:05:24,727
A few.

71
00:05:35,287 --> 00:05:37,785
It's a natural reaction...
under the circumstances.

72
00:05:38,852 --> 00:05:41,017
I keep wishing there were
some other way.

73
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:42,483
There isn't.

74
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:44,814
But if you talk to her.
If I talk to her.

75
00:05:46,181 --> 00:05:47,779
Joan, don't be naive.

76
00:05:48,678 --> 00:05:51,644
We have one alternative.
We decided that a long time ago.

77
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:55,641
It's funny...I can't even picture what
she looks like.

78
00:05:55,908 --> 00:05:57,239
Are we really so different?

79
00:05:58,805 --> 00:05:59,639
Completely.

80
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:03,702
All right, I'm younger than she is,
I'm prettier.

81
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:07,233
But she's probably more intelligent
than I am.

82
00:06:09,465 --> 00:06:12,164
It's a kind of destructive
intelligence.

83
00:06:12,563 --> 00:06:14,662
Why me?
What have I got to offer?

84
00:06:14,762 --> 00:06:16,128
A typical actress...

85
00:06:16,227 --> 00:06:18,527
Too many bit parts
and too much ambition.

86
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:20,259
I like ambition.

87
00:06:21,025 --> 00:06:22,657
For all the good it's done me.

88
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:24,456
It brought you to me, didn't it?

89
00:06:25,421 --> 00:06:28,154
With my nails gnawed off and
every neurosis in the book.

90
00:06:28,653 --> 00:06:30,685
I was in great shape, wasn't I?

91
00:06:31,352 --> 00:06:33,151
It's not a bad shape at all.

92
00:06:34,716 --> 00:06:35,649
Ray...

93
00:06:37,515 --> 00:06:39,746
Ray, you do love me, don't you?

94
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:41,378
Very much.

95
00:06:52,605 --> 00:06:54,669
I won't disappoint you tomorrow.

96
00:06:55,402 --> 00:06:56,869
I never thought you would.

97
00:07:23,384 --> 00:07:24,585
I didn't think you'd be up.

98
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,745
Don't bother to undress.

99
00:07:32,846 --> 00:07:35,544
You're sleeping in the guest room.
I've turned down the bed.

100
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:37,076
Carol.

101
00:07:37,576 --> 00:07:41,474
I think you should know I'm calling
my lawyers in the morning.

102
00:07:41,706 --> 00:07:44,171
It's been a long day.
Do we have to start on that again?

103
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:48,435
You'll have to indulge me just this
one last time, deary.

104
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:52,500
It's lucky for you.
I'm too well-bred to throw a tantrum.

105
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:54,798
All right...fire away.

106
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:57,197
Six months ago I gave you a choice...

107
00:07:58,596 --> 00:08:03,792
...between me and your...
how shall I put it...

108
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,890
Extracurricular activity.

109
00:08:07,224 --> 00:08:08,423
I made that choice.

110
00:08:08,523 --> 00:08:13,020
I wanted a husband in fact,
not just in appearance.

111
00:08:14,653 --> 00:08:17,883
If you refused I'd divorce you.

112
00:08:18,017 --> 00:08:19,782
There was a catch to that, as I recall.

113
00:08:21,115 --> 00:08:24,512
Well, naturally. You don't think
I'm going to make it easy for you?

114
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:27,511
I'd create as much scandal as I
possibly could...

115
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,910
and ruin your practice, entirely.

116
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,341
Aside from taking every penny that
I've got.

117
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:36,172
Those were my terms.
You accepted them...

118
00:08:37,805 --> 00:08:38,970
...until tonight.

119
00:08:39,104 --> 00:08:41,502
Carol, none of this is necessary.

120
00:08:41,635 --> 00:08:43,734
I told you.
I was with a patient.

121
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:47,398
Till one in the morning? What are you
doing, giving discount rates?

122
00:08:47,498 --> 00:08:49,530
On my way home I dropped by
to see Dr.Cobb.

123
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,429
He was the referral psychoanalyst
and we discussed the case.

124
00:08:53,294 --> 00:08:55,460
Do you really expect me to believe
that?

125
00:08:55,793 --> 00:08:56,858
Call him.

126
00:08:57,426 --> 00:08:59,724
What's that gonna prove?
He's a friend of yours.

127
00:08:59,824 --> 00:09:02,256
But his wife is a friend of yours,
talk to her.

128
00:09:21,777 --> 00:09:23,275
Hang up, hang up...

129
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:27,106
I haven't seen Cobb
for two weeks.

130
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:32,770
Then you've been lying to me.

131
00:09:33,702 --> 00:09:35,301
Not the way you think.

132
00:09:42,763 --> 00:09:44,762
Well I guess, the game's up...

133
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:49,725
I stopped by the hospital
to see Dr. Rosales.

134
00:09:50,358 --> 00:09:53,789
We talked about the trip you and I
were going to take to Acapulco.

135
00:09:55,955 --> 00:09:57,221
Acapulco?

136
00:09:57,587 --> 00:09:58,953
Yeah, we leave tomorrow night.

137
00:10:00,352 --> 00:10:03,217
Well, I thought we could use
a couple of days in the sun.

138
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:04,749
Just you and me.

139
00:10:06,382 --> 00:10:08,147
Happy anniversary, darling.

140
00:10:09,013 --> 00:10:10,679
Oh, Ray, darling.

141
00:10:13,677 --> 00:10:15,376
That's why I stopped in to see
Rosales.

142
00:10:15,476 --> 00:10:18,307
He's from Mexico and I thought maybe
he could...

143
00:10:18,407 --> 00:10:21,039
...fill me in on what to do
when we got there.

144
00:10:22,071 --> 00:10:23,770
Why didn't you tell me?

145
00:10:24,869 --> 00:10:28,101
Well, I was saving it for breakfast.
I wanted it to be a surprise.

146
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:30,599
And I almost ruined it.

147
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:33,298
Oh, darling.

148
00:10:33,664 --> 00:10:35,596
So you're going to have
a big day tomorrow.

149
00:10:36,662 --> 00:10:38,128
Why don't you get some sleep.

150
00:10:40,093 --> 00:10:41,859
I think I'll read for a while.

151
00:10:45,923 --> 00:10:46,888
Ray...

152
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,306
You can go in now, Miss Hudson.

153
00:11:11,406 --> 00:11:12,239
Thank you.

154
00:11:18,935 --> 00:11:20,767
Oh, darling, you're tense.

155
00:11:20,934 --> 00:11:21,766
A little.

156
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:24,332
Did you get any sleep last night?

157
00:11:24,565 --> 00:11:26,763
No...Well, maybe an hour or two.

158
00:11:34,426 --> 00:11:35,724
Take one of these when you get home.

159
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:36,624
What are they?

160
00:11:36,724 --> 00:11:39,355
Sleeping pills. I want you to
get some rest this afternoon.

161
00:11:39,488 --> 00:11:41,021
I can't. I'm working.

162
00:11:41,487 --> 00:11:44,086
This is an odd time to be pursuing
your career, isn't it?

163
00:11:44,186 --> 00:11:45,651
How many chances do I get?

164
00:11:46,117 --> 00:11:47,417
It's a good part.

165
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,282
Let's concentrate on the part you're
playing tonight.

166
00:11:55,245 --> 00:11:56,211
Do you think it'll fit?

167
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,809
Might be a little big.

168
00:12:00,175 --> 00:12:01,142
Noticeably?

169
00:12:01,608 --> 00:12:03,141
No, I don't think so.

170
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,472
Shall I take it home with me?

171
00:12:04,572 --> 00:12:07,071
No, I don't want you wearing it
until it's necessary.

172
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:10,236
This photograph is the best one
I have of her.

173
00:12:10,635 --> 00:12:13,567
In the others, she's standing off in the
distance or wearing sunglasses.

174
00:12:15,099 --> 00:12:16,299
Notice the makeup.

175
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,697
She uses a heavy eyebrow pencil.

176
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,096
What about the wig?

177
00:12:20,729 --> 00:12:23,094
I'll get it from the studio makeup
department today.

178
00:12:23,194 --> 00:12:24,660
They'll never know it's missing.

179
00:12:24,927 --> 00:12:26,492
Good, you take that along with you
as reference,

180
00:12:26,592 --> 00:12:28,524
But be sure you bring it back
tonight...

181
00:12:30,923 --> 00:12:32,489
Well, what about the timing?

182
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:35,553
I'll be at your apartment
at nine o'clock.

183
00:12:35,886 --> 00:12:36,952
But no sooner.

184
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:41,449
How do you get there?

185
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:42,782
Car?

186
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:44,481
You're testing me?

187
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,712
Do you mind?

188
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:50,310
No, I suppose we both have to be
sure about things.

189
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:54,874
I won't drive, I'll come by bus.

190
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,672
I'll get off a few blocks away and
walk.

191
00:12:58,106 --> 00:12:58,838
Right.

192
00:12:59,471 --> 00:13:02,535
Use the back entrance to the garage,
then take the service elevator.

193
00:13:03,469 --> 00:13:04,301
The apartment number?

194
00:13:04,635 --> 00:13:07,133
You're in the penthouse.
I ring the bell twice.

195
00:13:08,266 --> 00:13:09,431
Anything else?

196
00:13:11,297 --> 00:13:12,263
Joan?

197
00:13:12,663 --> 00:13:13,996
The sunglasses.

198
00:13:14,228 --> 00:13:15,128
Good girl.

199
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,226
And a large purse for the dress.

200
00:13:18,126 --> 00:13:20,058
Are you sure of everything?
Should I do it over again?

201
00:13:20,158 --> 00:13:21,891
No, I don't what to talk about it
any more.

202
00:13:21,991 --> 00:13:24,155
Oh, but it'll be fine.
I promise you.

203
00:13:24,788 --> 00:13:28,053
Just pretend you're working
on a role...right down to the props.

204
00:13:39,546 --> 00:13:40,879
I'll see you tonight.

205
00:14:23,218 --> 00:14:25,583
Ten o'clock?
Thank you very much.

206
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,481
The plane's leaving on schedule.

207
00:14:28,582 --> 00:14:29,681
Then you'd better hurry.

208
00:14:29,781 --> 00:14:31,645
Oh, darling, let's not rush.

209
00:14:32,046 --> 00:14:33,945
Here, let me help you with that.

210
00:14:34,844 --> 00:14:37,409
You're a brilliant man, but you're not
very mechanical.

211
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,007
That's what wives are for.

212
00:14:39,107 --> 00:14:41,639
That and other things.

213
00:14:43,172 --> 00:14:44,138
Burt Gordon called today.

214
00:14:44,238 --> 00:14:45,137
Anything important?

215
00:14:45,237 --> 00:14:46,969
No, just to wish us a pleasant trip.

216
00:14:47,403 --> 00:14:49,001
He could use a vacation himself,
you know.

217
00:14:49,101 --> 00:14:51,000
He's prosecuting two new cases
next month.

218
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,032
Well, that's what he gets for having
political ambitions...

219
00:14:55,364 --> 00:14:57,263
Do you remember him when he was in
law school?

220
00:14:57,362 --> 00:14:58,329
Vaguely.

221
00:14:58,695 --> 00:15:01,127
I never saw anybody work so hard...
including you.

222
00:15:01,726 --> 00:15:04,425
I didn't have to.
My wife had a rich father.

223
00:15:04,758 --> 00:15:07,057
And you married me for my money.

224
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,222
Not yours, darling.
Your father's.

225
00:15:09,322 --> 00:15:11,954
I like to think you loved me a little.
Didn't you?

226
00:15:12,053 --> 00:15:13,153
Of course I did...

227
00:15:14,752 --> 00:15:16,450
Is the maid coming tomorrow?

228
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:18,882
As far as I know.

229
00:15:19,283 --> 00:15:21,980
Why don't you give her a call and check?
Sometimes she forgets.

230
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,712
All right.

231
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:28,543
Oh, say did you see my blue dress?
My blue wool?

232
00:15:28,943 --> 00:15:29,775
My blue wool dress.

233
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,440
I was going to take it on the trip.
I can't find anywhere.

234
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:33,972
Maybe you sent it to the cleaners.

235
00:15:34,072 --> 00:15:37,404
Oh, no...it should be in the closet.
Where is that address book?

236
00:16:04,387 --> 00:16:06,153
Charlotte...this is Mrs.Flemming.

237
00:16:06,253 --> 00:16:08,152
I just wanted to be sure
you'll be in tomorrow.

238
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:10,283
Good.

239
00:16:10,483 --> 00:16:12,548
Oh, don't forget to water
the plants, huh?

240
00:16:13,548 --> 00:16:14,580
You've got your key, huh?

241
00:16:15,247 --> 00:16:16,046
Good.

242
00:16:16,713 --> 00:16:19,943
Oh, yes, we will.
Thank you very much. Bye.

243
00:16:27,805 --> 00:16:29,670
She's coming in at ten.

244
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,370
Good.

245
00:16:42,729 --> 00:16:43,529
Drink, darling?

246
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:46,860
No. Set it down, will you?

247
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:50,424
Such a beautiful night, isn't it?

248
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,889
I hadn't noticed.

249
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:58,220
Perfect weather for flying.
You can see for miles.

250
00:17:00,585 --> 00:17:01,851
Do you know what I was thinking?

251
00:17:02,683 --> 00:17:03,483
What?

252
00:17:04,015 --> 00:17:06,581
When we get back we must redecorate.

253
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,544
The place looks cold...it should
have warmer colors.

254
00:17:11,045 --> 00:17:14,110
Maybe we should buy some paintings of
soup cans.

255
00:17:14,275 --> 00:17:15,142
If you think so.

256
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,841
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

257
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:21,205
We're going to have such a
wonderful time the next few days.

258
00:17:22,637 --> 00:17:25,402
Does your secretary know
where you're going?

259
00:17:25,801 --> 00:17:28,966
Only that we're in Mexico.
No specifics.

260
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:32,530
Good.
Complete privacy.

261
00:17:32,964 --> 00:17:38,194
We're going to have a nice quiet
weekend.

262
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:44,024
You'd better close the doors
and change.

263
00:17:48,121 --> 00:17:51,152
Our second honeymoon may be better
than our first.

264
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:42,253
Hello?

265
00:18:43,385 --> 00:18:44,918
Oh...hello, Burt, how are you?

266
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:47,683
Well, yeah, Carol told me you called...

267
00:18:48,482 --> 00:18:50,348
Fine, fine, we're just leaving...

268
00:18:52,113 --> 00:18:54,578
Oh, no, she's uh...she's dressing.

269
00:18:55,311 --> 00:18:56,411
Yes, I'll tell her.

270
00:18:57,377 --> 00:19:00,641
I'd better be going now, Burt.
Give our love to Cynthia, will you?

271
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,573
All right.

272
00:21:29,447 --> 00:21:30,313
Joan!

273
00:21:30,979 --> 00:21:32,045
Did anyone see you come up?

274
00:21:33,244 --> 00:21:34,777
There's a drink on the bar.
Take it.

275
00:21:34,977 --> 00:21:35,643
No, I

276
00:21:35,742 --> 00:21:36,609
Take it!

277
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:38,707
And I want you to wear these gloves.

278
00:21:39,574 --> 00:21:42,405
Don't, please. I don't need a drink.
I'll be all right.

279
00:21:42,505 --> 00:21:44,104
Be careful not to touch anything.

280
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:46,236
Did you bring the photograph?

281
00:21:48,901 --> 00:21:49,733
The wig?

282
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:52,998
Yes, some shoes to go with the dress.

283
00:21:53,332 --> 00:21:54,031
Very good.

284
00:21:59,228 --> 00:22:01,893
Put this on.
Come on get ready.

285
00:23:56,953 --> 00:23:58,052
It looks fine.

286
00:23:58,552 --> 00:24:00,017
It won't fool anybody.

287
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,617
Don't be negative.

288
00:24:02,116 --> 00:24:04,148
Suppose we meet someone who knows
your wife?

289
00:24:04,248 --> 00:24:05,447
I don't even look like her.

290
00:24:05,714 --> 00:24:09,011
People see what they expect to see.
It's the principle of association.

291
00:24:09,345 --> 00:24:10,811
You're dressed like Carol and you're
travelling with me...

292
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,443
That means you are my wife.

293
00:24:13,709 --> 00:24:14,375
Are we ready?

294
00:24:14,575 --> 00:24:16,707
Not yet.
Make your call to the cleaners.

295
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,136
What are you waiting for?

296
00:24:24,368 --> 00:24:26,800
Well...won't they be closed this time
of night?

297
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,166
They're open till midnight.

298
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,618
Rodeo Cleaners? This is...

299
00:24:53,983 --> 00:24:57,015
This is Mrs.Flemming, Cumberland
Apartments on Wilshire.

300
00:24:57,648 --> 00:25:00,146
I have a bundle of laundry and some
things to clean...

301
00:25:01,145 --> 00:25:02,745
It'll be outside the door.

302
00:25:02,844 --> 00:25:04,410
I'm leaving it outside the door.

303
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,675
Will you have someone pick it up
first thing in the morning?

304
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:08,607
Thank you.

305
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,572
Fine. The sunglasses.

306
00:25:15,336 --> 00:25:16,302
Where are they?

307
00:25:16,702 --> 00:25:18,035
I know I have them.

308
00:25:20,766 --> 00:25:21,566
Good.

309
00:25:23,532 --> 00:25:24,664
Now, put these on.

310
00:25:25,364 --> 00:25:26,229
Why?

311
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,262
She always wore them with that dress.

312
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:43,218
When you get back from the airport,

313
00:25:43,318 --> 00:25:45,317
add the her dress and the gloves
to that bundle.

314
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,949
What about the wig?

315
00:25:47,582 --> 00:25:50,348
I'll return it Monday.
No one will know I have it.

316
00:25:50,947 --> 00:25:51,780
Fine.

317
00:25:52,312 --> 00:25:53,312
Are you ready?

318
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:55,943
I think so.

319
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,076
Let's get started.

320
00:26:04,339 --> 00:26:05,238
The light.

321
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:58,771
Dr. and Mrs.Ray Flemming,
ticket on 12-A.

322
00:27:00,436 --> 00:27:01,302
Thank you.

323
00:27:03,134 --> 00:27:05,200
Wait, you're 13 pounds
overweight, Doctor.

324
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,032
Put it on my credit card, will you?

325
00:27:11,862 --> 00:27:12,928
Mrs.Flemming.

326
00:27:14,028 --> 00:27:14,927
Carol.

327
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,126
Mrs.Flemming...

328
00:27:16,226 --> 00:27:16,792
Yes?

329
00:27:16,892 --> 00:27:18,758
Will you be carrying any
hand luggage aboard?

330
00:27:18,991 --> 00:27:19,790
No.

331
00:27:20,124 --> 00:27:21,556
Will you sign here please, Doctor?

332
00:27:28,818 --> 00:27:29,851
Thank you very much.

333
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:33,715
That'll be at Gate 35 boarding in
about three minutes.

334
00:27:36,647 --> 00:27:37,746
Have a pleasant trip, sir.

335
00:27:37,846 --> 00:27:38,578
Thank you.

336
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:47,506
<i>Flight number 12-A for Acapulco
is in the final boarding...</i>

337
00:27:47,606 --> 00:27:49,905
<i>process at Gate number 35.</i>

338
00:27:50,271 --> 00:27:53,602
<i>Passengers having reservations
for this flight should be on board.</i>

339
00:27:55,368 --> 00:27:56,801
May I have your names, please?

340
00:27:56,933 --> 00:27:58,299
Dr. and Mrs.Flemming.

341
00:27:59,532 --> 00:28:01,564
Ah, aisle 3, seats A and B.

342
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,463
Thank you.

343
00:28:20,152 --> 00:28:22,017
Remember...don't call or try to get
in touch with me.

344
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,216
I'll reach you.

345
00:28:23,883 --> 00:28:25,015
When will I see you?

346
00:28:25,215 --> 00:28:27,447
Not for a while.
At least a week.

347
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,279
Ray, I'm worried.

348
00:28:29,413 --> 00:28:30,945
Don't be.
Just try to get some rest.

349
00:28:31,046 --> 00:28:33,377
And don't read the papers,
they'll upset you.

350
00:28:35,209 --> 00:28:36,275
Shall we get started?

351
00:28:36,975 --> 00:28:37,907
What should I say?

352
00:28:38,107 --> 00:28:40,206
You're an actress, darling.
Improvise.

353
00:28:42,438 --> 00:28:44,603
If you feel that way, why'd you
agree to come along?

354
00:28:44,836 --> 00:28:47,068
It's a good question!
I really don't know.

355
00:28:47,402 --> 00:28:49,301
You never wanted to take this trip
in the first place.

356
00:28:49,466 --> 00:28:50,266
Can you blame me?

357
00:28:50,366 --> 00:28:53,032
What am I supposed to do...sit in our
room while you go fishing?

358
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:54,730
Maybe you'd rather not go at all!

359
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,929
Maybe I wouldn't!

360
00:28:56,229 --> 00:28:57,495
Fine. Spend the weekend
with your friends.

361
00:28:57,595 --> 00:28:58,827
Run up a nice bar bill.

362
00:28:58,927 --> 00:29:00,559
Leave my friends out of this!

363
00:29:01,092 --> 00:29:02,991
Will you lower your voice?
People are listening.

364
00:29:03,091 --> 00:29:05,623
I don't care who's listening!
I wasn't the one that started this.

365
00:29:05,723 --> 00:29:06,856
You're making a scene.

366
00:29:06,956 --> 00:29:08,554
Oh, this is impossible!

367
00:29:08,655 --> 00:29:09,521
What do you think you're doing?

368
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,420
Isn't it obvious?
I'm leaving!

369
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:12,586
Carol, don't be a fool.

370
00:29:12,685 --> 00:29:13,585
Have they shut the door yet?

371
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:15,384
No, ma'am, but we're just about to...

372
00:29:15,484 --> 00:29:18,881
Enjoy yourself. I'm sure
you'll have a better time without me.

373
00:29:19,714 --> 00:29:20,347
Carol!

374
00:29:23,212 --> 00:29:24,977
Is there anything I can do, sir?

375
00:29:25,211 --> 00:29:26,143
No, let her go.

376
00:31:00,283 --> 00:31:03,049
Miguel, why don't you fix us some lunch?
I'm starving.

377
00:32:33,358 --> 00:32:34,390
Doctor Flemming?

378
00:32:40,386 --> 00:32:41,086
Who are you?

379
00:32:41,785 --> 00:32:43,518
Lieutenant Columbo, police.

380
00:32:44,783 --> 00:32:46,183
I don't understand.

381
00:32:47,083 --> 00:32:48,314
What's happened here?

382
00:32:48,648 --> 00:32:49,481
Where's my wife?

383
00:32:50,147 --> 00:32:52,845
Maybe you'd better sit down.
I've got some bad news for you.

384
00:32:53,678 --> 00:32:55,110
Has something happened to Carol?

385
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,976
You sure you don't want to sit down?

386
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,206
Has she been in an accident?

387
00:33:01,306 --> 00:33:02,340
Not exactly...

388
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,971
Well, what is it?
Tell me.

389
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:10,400
Well...somebody broke in here and
tried to kill her.

390
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,758
Tried to kill her?

391
00:33:24,525 --> 00:33:26,957
That's right, Doctor.
She's lucky, she's still alive.

392
00:33:28,056 --> 00:33:29,655
She's still alive...

393
00:33:30,422 --> 00:33:31,854
Well, where is she now?

394
00:33:32,054 --> 00:33:33,619
She's at the hospital.

395
00:33:34,652 --> 00:33:37,350
You're sure you don't want a drink?
Water, brandy or something?

396
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,616
No, no, I want to know how she is.

397
00:33:39,915 --> 00:33:42,913
Is she conscious?
Has she been able to say anything?

398
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:46,377
I'm afraid not.
She's been in a coma.

399
00:33:46,544 --> 00:33:48,111
What's her condition, right now?

400
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:52,408
Oh, come on!
I must know the truth.

401
00:33:53,674 --> 00:33:55,005
It's not very good, Doctor.

402
00:33:55,106 --> 00:33:59,203
We only hope she comes to long
enough to be able to talk to us.

403
00:33:59,703 --> 00:34:00,902
I've got to see her!

404
00:34:01,002 --> 00:34:04,034
Don't you think you ought to rest a
while?

405
00:34:04,133 --> 00:34:06,199
After all, it's been quite a shock...

406
00:34:06,499 --> 00:34:07,465
Well you can understand.

407
00:34:07,565 --> 00:34:09,729
My wife's in hospital.
She may be dying.

408
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,129
I want to see her.

409
00:34:11,229 --> 00:34:14,626
All right.
I've got a car downstairs.

410
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:21,489
I don't want to talk to anyone, now.

411
00:34:22,655 --> 00:34:25,353
Might be the hospital, Doctor.
They know I'm here.

412
00:34:34,481 --> 00:34:36,213
Hello?
This is Dr.Flemming.

413
00:34:36,546 --> 00:34:39,510
Darling, I just had to talk to you.
The newspapers...

414
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,876
No, I...I can't keep any
appointments today.

415
00:34:41,975 --> 00:34:44,075
Why don't you come in Friday at two?

416
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:46,506
My secretary will verify it.

417
00:34:47,006 --> 00:34:48,372
Ray...is there someone with you?

418
00:34:54,201 --> 00:34:56,267
They expect me to be on call
at all hours.

419
00:34:56,367 --> 00:34:57,800
Same with me, Doc.

420
00:35:05,761 --> 00:35:07,460
Nurse, I'm Dr.Flemming.

421
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,825
My wife is a patient here.
I'd like to see her.

422
00:35:13,489 --> 00:35:14,922
I'm afraid she's on the critical list.

423
00:35:15,021 --> 00:35:16,787
She's not permitted to have any
visitors.

424
00:35:16,887 --> 00:35:17,987
Miss, I'm a Doctor!

425
00:35:18,086 --> 00:35:19,585
I'm sorry, but my orders...

426
00:35:19,685 --> 00:35:22,117
Is Dr.Lansbury still Chief of staff
here?

427
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:26,148
Tell him that Dr.Ray Flemming is here
and would like to see him.

428
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,213
He may be in surgery, Doctor.

429
00:35:28,313 --> 00:35:30,545
But you wouldn't know that unless
you check, would you mind?

430
00:35:36,275 --> 00:35:38,607
Dr.Lansbury, please, reception.

431
00:35:39,739 --> 00:35:42,637
There's a Dr.Flemming here.
He insists on seeing his wife.

432
00:35:43,004 --> 00:35:44,736
Yes, thank you.

433
00:35:45,668 --> 00:35:46,901
He's being paged.

434
00:35:47,268 --> 00:35:48,100
Thank you.

435
00:35:49,999 --> 00:35:51,332
Hospital red tape.

436
00:35:51,865 --> 00:35:53,597
Yeah, I know what you mean, Doctor.

437
00:35:54,296 --> 00:35:55,529
Well, let's get on with it.

438
00:35:56,528 --> 00:35:57,661
Get on with what?

439
00:35:57,861 --> 00:35:59,093
Your red tape...

440
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:03,357
This thief, did he leave any traces?

441
00:36:03,491 --> 00:36:07,788
Oh, no. Not a thing. But of course
we might be able to run him down,

442
00:36:07,888 --> 00:36:09,353
when he tries to sell the stuff
he stole.

443
00:36:09,453 --> 00:36:13,884
We can't be sure, but we think maybe
he stole some of your wife's jewelry,

444
00:36:13,984 --> 00:36:15,250
and some other things.

445
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:16,915
Listen Doc, when you get a chance,

446
00:36:17,016 --> 00:36:19,247
Would you make out a list of
what was stolen?

447
00:36:19,447 --> 00:36:20,214
Of course.

448
00:36:20,646 --> 00:36:23,711
And then, we can check with
the fences and the pawn shops.

449
00:36:23,811 --> 00:36:26,010
Who knows, you know,
something might turn up.

450
00:36:26,576 --> 00:36:29,241
Oh, a few questions for my
report, Doc...

451
00:36:29,341 --> 00:36:33,605
Now, you were in Mexico
when this thing took place.

452
00:36:33,739 --> 00:36:36,836
And the dates, they were...

453
00:36:37,702 --> 00:36:39,701
You don't have a pencil, do you?

454
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,266
Thanks.

455
00:36:42,965 --> 00:36:45,564
You know, my wife, she gives me one
every morning, and uh...

456
00:36:45,731 --> 00:36:47,663
I just can't seem to hold on to it.

457
00:36:48,396 --> 00:36:50,828
Oh yes...Now, we know you were in
Mexico...

458
00:36:50,927 --> 00:36:54,891
But the local police down there
they couldn't seem to locate you.

459
00:36:55,790 --> 00:37:00,221
Yes, I was in a little village about
20 miles from Acapulco.

460
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:03,152
It was very quiet and relaxing.

461
00:37:03,553 --> 00:37:05,051
And hardly any telephones.

462
00:37:06,584 --> 00:37:09,649
<i>Dr. Lansbury, call
reception desk, please.</i>

463
00:37:09,749 --> 00:37:13,612
I ah...I suppose you know about what
happened on the plane.

464
00:37:14,945 --> 00:37:18,910
Yeah, yeah, we talked with the
airline people.

465
00:37:19,009 --> 00:37:20,841
And they told us that you and
your wife checked in.

466
00:37:20,941 --> 00:37:22,441
Boy, that really threw us.

467
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:26,905
But then of course we contacted the
stewardess and she explained what happened.

468
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:28,903
Yes, it was my fault.

469
00:37:29,803 --> 00:37:33,334
We had an argument on the plane,
something ridiculous.

470
00:37:33,434 --> 00:37:35,966
I never thought that she'd actually
leave.

471
00:37:36,898 --> 00:37:40,096
Yeah, she probably went home and
went right to bed.

472
00:37:40,196 --> 00:37:42,494
I guess the attack was
close to midnight.

473
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,659
I mean, we know she was at the
airport at ten o'clock.

474
00:37:47,025 --> 00:37:50,690
Lieutenant, if there's any further way
that I can be of assistance to you.

475
00:37:50,789 --> 00:37:54,853
Oh, no, no, you just make out
that list. That'll be fine, Doc.

476
00:37:56,686 --> 00:37:59,184
Oh, oh, one more thing before I
forget.

477
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:03,014
I had to borrow a photograph
the other day. I hope you don't mind.

478
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,014
A photograph?

479
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:05,413
Yeah, a picture of you and your wife.

480
00:38:05,513 --> 00:38:08,644
We had to have something to show the
stewardess. For identification.

481
00:38:09,344 --> 00:38:10,110
I see.

482
00:38:11,109 --> 00:38:13,775
She was still out of town, but we
contacted her by phone.

483
00:38:14,007 --> 00:38:16,906
And we sent the picture down by
Wire photo.

484
00:38:18,471 --> 00:38:19,405
And?

485
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:22,269
She identified your wife.

486
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:24,801
The picture wasn't too clear
but she recognized her.

487
00:38:26,034 --> 00:38:26,866
Ray!

488
00:38:28,565 --> 00:38:31,096
I was hoping to find you here.
Are you all right?

489
00:38:31,397 --> 00:38:33,062
I'm holding up, I suppose.

490
00:38:33,162 --> 00:38:35,394
I just don't know what to say.
It's terrible.

491
00:38:35,527 --> 00:38:37,359
We just saw her at your party.

492
00:38:37,459 --> 00:38:38,192
I know.

493
00:38:38,293 --> 00:38:39,392
What happened on Friday?

494
00:38:39,492 --> 00:38:41,924
When I called, the two of you were
getting ready to leave.

495
00:38:42,056 --> 00:38:45,621
We had an argument on the plane.
Suddenly Carol decided she wasn't going.

496
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,887
She walked off.

497
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:47,986
I shouldn't have let her...

498
00:38:48,086 --> 00:38:51,151
You can't blame yourself.
How could you possibly have known.

499
00:38:54,116 --> 00:38:55,382
Have you heard anything yet?

500
00:38:55,482 --> 00:38:56,481
Not yet, Doctor.

501
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,612
Lieutenant Columbo.

502
00:38:59,612 --> 00:39:02,077
My name's Gordon. I'm with the
District Attorney's office.

503
00:39:02,177 --> 00:39:03,143
Yes, sir, I know.

504
00:39:03,243 --> 00:39:05,575
I appreciate it, anything you
can do for Dr.Flemming.

505
00:39:05,675 --> 00:39:06,941
He's a good friend of mine.

506
00:39:07,173 --> 00:39:08,173
I'll try.

507
00:39:09,406 --> 00:39:12,237
Ray, we're going to find the man
that is responsible for this.

508
00:39:12,337 --> 00:39:15,269
As soon as Carol gets better and
can give us a full description.

509
00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:19,399
By the way, Cynthia wants you to
spend the next few days with us.

510
00:39:20,032 --> 00:39:21,265
Let me think about it, will you.

511
00:39:21,365 --> 00:39:22,331
I understand.

512
00:39:22,464 --> 00:39:23,497
Dr.Flemming?

513
00:39:23,663 --> 00:39:25,363
Dr.Lansbury on the phone.

514
00:39:26,495 --> 00:39:27,427
Hello, Doctor.

515
00:39:27,728 --> 00:39:29,726
There's something I want you
to do for me.

516
00:39:31,459 --> 00:39:33,690
Any progress so far?

517
00:39:35,389 --> 00:39:38,754
Well, it's still a little early, but...

518
00:39:39,454 --> 00:39:41,785
Sooner or later something
usually breaks.

519
00:39:42,252 --> 00:39:44,850
Let's make that sooner.
Right, Lieutenant?

520
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:46,749
Try my best.

521
00:39:46,848 --> 00:39:47,948
I'm sure you will.

522
00:39:48,047 --> 00:39:50,613
I don't think I have to remind
you that this could be...

523
00:39:50,713 --> 00:39:52,944
quite the little feather in your cap.

524
00:39:53,445 --> 00:39:56,009
Wrap it up and everybody is happy.

525
00:39:58,108 --> 00:39:59,140
Lieutenant?

526
00:40:00,241 --> 00:40:02,838
Oh, I'm sorry. I was uh...

527
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,770
I was just thinking about something.

528
00:40:04,871 --> 00:40:05,637
What was that?

529
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:07,869
No, it's nothing important. It's uh...

530
00:40:08,368 --> 00:40:12,466
Dr.Flemming, he didn't call to his wife
when he came back to his apartment.

531
00:40:12,999 --> 00:40:14,198
I don't follow you.

532
00:40:14,798 --> 00:40:17,129
Well, I was in the bedroom
I was checking some things,

533
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:20,194
And I heard him open the front door.
And he didn't say anything...

534
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,793
Gee, it's funny how people are different,
isn't it?

535
00:40:23,192 --> 00:40:25,957
Now, you take myself,
when I come home from a trip, uh...

536
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:29,255
First thing I do is,
I say, "Honey? You here?"

537
00:40:29,355 --> 00:40:31,620
Exactly what is your point,
Lieutenant?

538
00:40:32,853 --> 00:40:33,652
Point?

539
00:40:34,152 --> 00:40:35,351
I wasn't making a point.

540
00:40:35,484 --> 00:40:37,383
It sounded to me as if you were.

541
00:40:37,883 --> 00:40:40,415
You heard the man admit that
he had an argument with his wife.

542
00:40:40,515 --> 00:40:43,046
He probably still had a chip on his
shoulder this morning.

543
00:40:43,213 --> 00:40:43,846
I was only...

544
00:40:43,946 --> 00:40:46,678
Lieutenant, I have already told you
that...

545
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,742
Dr.Flemming is a close
personal friend of mine.

546
00:40:48,843 --> 00:40:50,974
Now I hope he's not going to be annoyed
by a lot of...

547
00:40:51,141 --> 00:40:53,539
...tactless remarks,
especially at a time like this.

548
00:40:54,939 --> 00:40:57,870
Well, I'm sorry Mr.Gordon. I guess
I shouldn't have mentioned it.

549
00:41:03,466 --> 00:41:04,899
They're letting me go up
to see her.

550
00:41:04,999 --> 00:41:06,398
Good.
You need company?

551
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:09,163
No, I'd rather be with her alone.

552
00:41:11,128 --> 00:41:12,594
I'll have to go with you, Doc.

553
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,259
Why?

554
00:41:14,593 --> 00:41:16,292
We got a man on the door.

555
00:41:26,552 --> 00:41:30,149
Uh...it's all right, officer.
This is her husband.

556
00:41:30,249 --> 00:41:32,614
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
Nobody's allowed in right now.

557
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:33,581
Why not?

558
00:41:33,681 --> 00:41:36,013
She's conscious.
The doctor's with her.

559
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,342
Well, maybe we got lucky.

560
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:13,488
Oh, Doctor...I'm the patient's
husband. Is she...all right?

561
00:42:14,988 --> 00:42:18,186
I'm sorry...she passed away.

562
00:42:25,914 --> 00:42:29,512
Did she...did she say anything?

563
00:42:30,478 --> 00:42:34,908
If it's any consolation, one thing
she said was your name...

564
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:14,816
Getting some fresh air?

565
00:43:16,582 --> 00:43:18,481
I was on my way back from lunch.

566
00:43:19,047 --> 00:43:22,412
Well, as a matter of fact, I was headed
toward your office myself.

567
00:43:22,511 --> 00:43:24,111
Do you mind if I walk along?

568
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:25,876
Not at all.

569
00:43:30,573 --> 00:43:31,539
Any news?

570
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:32,772
No, nothing much, Doctor.

571
00:43:32,871 --> 00:43:34,237
We're just sorta waiting around...

572
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:36,436
...until our friend tries to
get rid of the jewelry.

573
00:43:37,669 --> 00:43:39,767
I'd imagine he'd hold on to it
for a while.

574
00:43:40,999 --> 00:43:42,299
Yeah, probably.

575
00:43:45,564 --> 00:43:47,096
Have I had any calls, Miss Petrie?

576
00:43:47,995 --> 00:43:50,160
Five or six.
I left a list on your desk.

577
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,659
First day back and everyone wants me
to hold their hands.

578
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:03,952
You know, I've never been in a
psychiatrist's office before...

579
00:44:04,151 --> 00:44:05,085
...first time.

580
00:44:05,551 --> 00:44:06,950
I keep looking for the couch.

581
00:44:07,583 --> 00:44:08,315
So do my patients.

582
00:44:08,415 --> 00:44:10,347
I keep telling them it's bad
for their posture.

583
00:44:10,448 --> 00:44:12,779
"Bad for their posture,"
that's very good.

584
00:44:13,113 --> 00:44:16,577
I tell you, you put me in a horizontal
position, I'd fall asleep.

585
00:44:16,677 --> 00:44:18,975
Nice office, though.
It seems restful.

586
00:44:19,475 --> 00:44:22,773
I guess it puts people in the mood
to talk.

587
00:44:23,206 --> 00:44:28,170
You know, my sister, she has a
living room...it's very very modern.

588
00:44:28,703 --> 00:44:31,867
Well, the minute you sit down there,
you can't open your mouth.

589
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,964
You know, she's got this big, kidney-shaped
coffee table.

590
00:44:36,065 --> 00:44:37,930
It upsets me just to look at it.

591
00:44:38,663 --> 00:44:40,063
Her husband, he doesn't say anything.

592
00:44:40,162 --> 00:44:44,293
And I figure the coffee table
got to him years ago.

593
00:44:45,858 --> 00:44:47,224
Is there something I can do for you?

594
00:44:47,557 --> 00:44:49,955
No, not really, Doctor. No.

595
00:44:50,089 --> 00:44:52,320
I just came up to bring back
your pen.

596
00:44:52,854 --> 00:44:55,219
I forgot to give it to you
at the inquest.

597
00:44:55,452 --> 00:44:57,217
Thanks. I missed it.

598
00:44:57,451 --> 00:44:59,450
You know, that's my trouble,
I got a bad memory.

599
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:02,515
My wife tells me I oughtta have
strings on all ten fingers.

600
00:45:03,913 --> 00:45:05,379
Was there anything else you wanted?

601
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:09,344
Oh no, it's nothing important.
There's one detail that bothers me.

602
00:45:09,443 --> 00:45:10,376
What is it?

603
00:45:10,842 --> 00:45:13,675
It's um...it's about you luggage.

604
00:45:14,774 --> 00:45:15,839
My luggage?

605
00:45:17,838 --> 00:45:19,604
I think you need fluid here.

606
00:45:20,237 --> 00:45:21,202
Oh, no, maybe...

607
00:45:23,068 --> 00:45:25,433
Oh, yeah, well it's quite a flame.

608
00:45:28,132 --> 00:45:29,764
You were talking about my luggage.

609
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:34,861
Yeah. You took two suitcases
with you, didn't you?

610
00:45:34,961 --> 00:45:36,992
Well. Actually we packed more than
we needed.

611
00:45:38,158 --> 00:45:40,990
I went out to the airport the other
day. You know, just a routine check.

612
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:44,122
And it seems as though you were
13 pounds overweight.

613
00:45:44,222 --> 00:45:45,954
You know, they keep those records.

614
00:45:46,054 --> 00:45:48,486
Yes, I know.
I charged it on my credit card.

615
00:45:49,751 --> 00:45:50,817
Well, when you came back,

616
00:45:50,917 --> 00:45:53,216
I know, it's a stupid point, Doc,
and it doesn't mean anything.

617
00:45:53,316 --> 00:45:56,080
But you were only
four pounds overweight.

618
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:59,511
I was wondering what happened
to the other nine pounds?

619
00:46:01,311 --> 00:46:03,275
I don't see what that has to do
with my wife's death.

620
00:46:03,542 --> 00:46:04,942
Oh, it's all part of the job.

621
00:46:05,041 --> 00:46:07,240
You know, just trying to tie
the loose ends together.

622
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:12,370
You went to a lot of trouble, didn't you?
Going all the way out to the airport.

623
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:16,501
Forty-five minutes. Boy, that's
quite a place, that airport.

624
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,833
You know, I get lost just walking
around.

625
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,431
Lieutenant, about those nine pounds.

626
00:46:21,664 --> 00:46:24,829
I took along a stack of trade journals
and medical magazines.

627
00:46:25,195 --> 00:46:27,627
You know, it seems I never get a chance
to go through them at the office.

628
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:29,492
Catchin' up on your reading?

629
00:46:29,626 --> 00:46:30,891
You might say that.

630
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:33,223
You didn't bring them back, then?

631
00:46:33,823 --> 00:46:36,854
There'd be no reason to.
It was mostly advertising stuff.

632
00:46:38,287 --> 00:46:41,019
And you figure they weighed as much
as nine pounds?

633
00:46:41,285 --> 00:46:43,650
They'd have to. Why else
the weight discrepancy?

634
00:46:44,249 --> 00:46:46,781
Yeah. Well, I guess
that clears that up.

635
00:46:46,881 --> 00:46:50,346
OK Doc, thank you very much.
I'm sorry I bothered you.

636
00:46:50,446 --> 00:46:51,712
No bother at all.

637
00:46:52,545 --> 00:46:54,444
Oh, listen, there's one more thing.

638
00:46:55,242 --> 00:46:58,407
You don't remember what your wife was
wearing that night, do you?

639
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,705
Carol had so many dresses.
Is it important?

640
00:47:03,204 --> 00:47:04,670
Well, yes, in a way, it is.

641
00:47:05,569 --> 00:47:11,366
Let's see now ah yes, she was wearing
a blue wool dress with brass buttons...

642
00:47:11,665 --> 00:47:12,831
If I'm not mistaken.

643
00:47:13,698 --> 00:47:15,396
Yeah, that's what the stewardess
said.

644
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:18,528
She's back in town, by the way, and
I spoke to her and...

645
00:47:18,661 --> 00:47:23,458
She told me your wife was wearing
a blue wool dress with blue kid gloves.

646
00:47:23,824 --> 00:47:25,324
Well then, that's probably it.

647
00:47:27,956 --> 00:47:29,621
That's funny though, if...

648
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,419
...if she came home from the airport, what
did she do with the dress and gloves?

649
00:47:34,118 --> 00:47:36,783
When we went over to your apartment
last week, we couldn't find them.

650
00:47:37,216 --> 00:47:38,715
Well, they may have been stolen.

651
00:47:39,114 --> 00:47:40,647
Yeah, maybe, maybe.

652
00:47:40,847 --> 00:47:43,745
Did you put those on the list of
stolen items?

653
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:47,276
Really, Lieutenant, how could you expect
me to notice they were missing?

654
00:47:48,442 --> 00:47:51,207
Still, it's puzzling when you
think about it.

655
00:47:51,774 --> 00:47:54,471
I mean, why would a guy steal
a dress and a pair of gloves?

656
00:47:54,572 --> 00:47:55,405
What are they worth?

657
00:47:56,071 --> 00:47:57,836
People don't always do the rational
thing.

658
00:47:58,136 --> 00:47:59,635
Oh, they sure don't.

659
00:48:00,035 --> 00:48:02,200
You learn a lot about that
in my line.

660
00:48:03,266 --> 00:48:04,932
Well I guess, you do in yours, too.

661
00:48:07,031 --> 00:48:08,096
Oh, excuse me.

662
00:48:08,629 --> 00:48:09,229
Yeah?

663
00:48:09,496 --> 00:48:10,894
Miss Hudson is here, Doctor.

664
00:48:11,061 --> 00:48:12,160
I'll be through in a moment.

665
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:15,059
I have a patient coming in now,
Lieutenant.

666
00:48:16,791 --> 00:48:18,090
Two o'clock.

667
00:48:18,223 --> 00:48:21,488
Oh, that was the one who called you
at your apartment.

668
00:48:21,588 --> 00:48:23,554
Oh, and you say you have a bad memory.

669
00:48:23,654 --> 00:48:26,585
Well, listen.
It comes and goes, you know.

670
00:48:27,118 --> 00:48:29,083
I'm sorry I couldn't have been
any help to you...

671
00:48:29,182 --> 00:48:31,048
with the dress and gloves, but uh...

672
00:48:31,315 --> 00:48:33,047
Maybe you just missed them
in your search.

673
00:48:33,147 --> 00:48:35,546
Yeah, you're probably right, Doc.

674
00:48:36,012 --> 00:48:37,311
Listen, uh...

675
00:48:38,044 --> 00:48:40,875
Would you mind if I came over this
afternoon and took another look?

676
00:48:41,042 --> 00:48:42,674
What time do you think
you're gonna be home?

677
00:48:42,941 --> 00:48:44,007
Not before five.

678
00:48:44,207 --> 00:48:46,039
Suppose I meet you there
at five-thirty.

679
00:48:46,938 --> 00:48:48,371
If you think it's necessary.

680
00:48:48,604 --> 00:48:51,202
Well, it's just another loose end.
You understand.

681
00:48:56,165 --> 00:48:57,964
You can go in now, Miss Hudson.

682
00:49:01,329 --> 00:49:02,195
Oh, Miss?

683
00:49:03,028 --> 00:49:05,693
Excuse me.
What was your name again?

684
00:49:07,026 --> 00:49:08,725
Joan Hudson. Why?

685
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:10,956
Sorry to trouble you, Ma'am.

686
00:49:18,185 --> 00:49:19,751
Who was that man out there?

687
00:49:19,851 --> 00:49:22,316
Lieutenant Columbo.
He's a police officer. Why?

688
00:49:22,415 --> 00:49:23,882
He wanted to know my name.

689
00:49:24,015 --> 00:49:24,947
Did you tell him?

690
00:49:25,314 --> 00:49:26,580
What else could I do?

691
00:49:30,544 --> 00:49:32,077
Ray, is something wrong?

692
00:49:32,343 --> 00:49:33,575
He was with me when you called.

693
00:49:33,675 --> 00:49:35,574
I told you not to try to get in touch
with me.

694
00:49:35,674 --> 00:49:36,307
I had to...

695
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:39,372
...when I read that Carol was
still alive I wanted to warn you.

696
00:49:39,671 --> 00:49:40,871
Well, not to worry about it.

697
00:49:40,971 --> 00:49:43,669
As far as he knows, you're just another
patient on my list.

698
00:49:45,435 --> 00:49:46,367
Now...

699
00:49:48,166 --> 00:49:50,865
Now I am going to call the
cleaners.

700
00:49:51,431 --> 00:49:53,029
You did as I told you, didn't you?

701
00:49:53,796 --> 00:49:56,861
You left Carol's dress and gloves
with the rest of the laundry?

702
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:58,293
Gloves...?

703
00:49:59,059 --> 00:50:00,625
Yes, dress and gloves.

704
00:50:01,091 --> 00:50:02,790
Well, you know, Joan, I told you.

705
00:50:11,651 --> 00:50:12,351
What is it?

706
00:50:13,883 --> 00:50:16,515
I changed in the restroom
at the airport and...

707
00:50:16,615 --> 00:50:18,247
...put her things in my bag.

708
00:50:19,513 --> 00:50:21,378
Then I went back to your apartment,

709
00:50:21,678 --> 00:50:24,143
and left the dress
with the other laundry.

710
00:50:27,807 --> 00:50:28,640
Go on.

711
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,972
But I...I forgot about the
gloves.

712
00:50:32,071 --> 00:50:34,103
I didn't even think of them
until you mentioned them.

713
00:50:34,536 --> 00:50:37,568
But we went over it.
How many times did I tell you?

714
00:50:37,668 --> 00:50:40,766
I'm sorry.
But what difference does it make?

715
00:50:41,165 --> 00:50:42,265
Is it that important?

716
00:50:42,365 --> 00:50:45,830
Is it that important?
Where are the gloves now?

717
00:50:46,162 --> 00:50:49,061
They're in my other bag at home.
I haven't used it since that night.

718
00:50:51,126 --> 00:50:52,258
Let me think...

719
00:50:53,058 --> 00:50:56,556
We're safe as far as the dress is concerned,
it's at the cleaners.

720
00:50:57,855 --> 00:50:59,354
Now the gloves?

721
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:04,951
They're small, they could be easily
overlooked. They could be almost anywhere.

722
00:51:06,882 --> 00:51:09,880
Listen, Columbo's coming back
to my apartment.

723
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:11,447
He wants to make another search.

724
00:51:11,547 --> 00:51:14,911
You go back home, get the gloves,
and come back to my place.

725
00:51:15,011 --> 00:51:16,843
I'll see you there in an hour.

726
00:51:16,943 --> 00:51:18,309
Why can't I just throw them away?

727
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:19,841
Because I want him to find them.

728
00:51:20,175 --> 00:51:23,305
He'll only be satisfied if all his
loose ends are in place.

729
00:51:23,405 --> 00:51:24,071
But Ray...

730
00:51:24,172 --> 00:51:26,137
Now, you just do as I say, darling.

731
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:27,537
Hurry!

732
00:51:53,087 --> 00:51:54,386
There you are.

733
00:51:58,717 --> 00:51:59,749
Did you bring them?

734
00:52:00,516 --> 00:52:03,614
Good. Put them on the table.
I'll hide them in her bureau.

735
00:52:04,379 --> 00:52:06,478
Columbo's going to find them
this time...

736
00:52:07,344 --> 00:52:08,511
Would you like a drink?

737
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:09,376
Please.

738
00:52:13,607 --> 00:52:15,006
Are you angry with me?

739
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:16,538
Not at all.

740
00:52:17,471 --> 00:52:19,370
I would have to do something foolish.

741
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:22,068
I kept going over everything
in my mind.

742
00:52:22,634 --> 00:52:24,234
But those stupid gloves.

743
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:27,232
Don't you worry about it.
We've protected ourselves.

744
00:52:33,194 --> 00:52:34,594
I've missed you.

745
00:52:35,493 --> 00:52:38,091
I'm lucky I was working...it helped
me get through the week.

746
00:52:38,491 --> 00:52:39,857
It's behind us now.

747
00:52:41,022 --> 00:52:43,554
What about that man...that Columbo?

748
00:52:43,721 --> 00:52:45,121
You'll never see him again.

749
00:52:45,587 --> 00:52:47,386
But why does he keep bothering you?

750
00:52:49,184 --> 00:52:52,515
Because Carol's death has been almost
too perfect.

751
00:52:53,515 --> 00:52:56,446
That's what irritates him, it's like
a speck in his eye.

752
00:52:57,146 --> 00:52:59,611
He'd even look for flaws
in the Old Testament.

753
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:02,809
You don't seem to be very upset about it.

754
00:53:03,109 --> 00:53:04,241
Why should I be?

755
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:07,140
Whatever he turns up I've got an
answer for him.

756
00:53:07,905 --> 00:53:10,970
Eventually he'll lose interest and
start hounding someone else.

757
00:53:12,636 --> 00:53:14,469
I wish I could feel that sure.

758
00:53:15,167 --> 00:53:18,232
The past two weeks I've been
trying to find...

759
00:53:18,332 --> 00:53:23,729
...an excuse for what we've done...
I haven't been very successful.

760
00:53:23,829 --> 00:53:24,695
Joan...

761
00:53:26,227 --> 00:53:27,827
There was no other option.

762
00:53:28,792 --> 00:53:30,258
Does that justify...?

763
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:32,124
Yes.

764
00:53:33,456 --> 00:53:34,522
We're in love...

765
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:38,353
We want a future together. That's
all the justification we need.

766
00:53:39,419 --> 00:53:42,284
Look, this isn't something you just
forget.

767
00:53:43,783 --> 00:53:45,881
Don't let it interfere with
what we have.

768
00:53:47,847 --> 00:53:48,946
I won't.

769
00:53:54,409 --> 00:54:00,039
All we have to do is wait.
I promise I'll make it up to you.

770
00:54:16,895 --> 00:54:18,194
What are you doing here?

771
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:20,826
Doctor, I...ah...

772
00:54:21,326 --> 00:54:25,357
I just kinda thought I'd save you some
time and look for the stuff myself.

773
00:54:25,489 --> 00:54:28,221
I mean, I just didn't want to
inconvenience you more that I have to.

774
00:54:28,621 --> 00:54:30,886
Don't you people usually require
a search warrant?

775
00:54:31,386 --> 00:54:34,117
I just didn't think
it was necessary, Doctor.

776
00:54:34,817 --> 00:54:36,749
I mean, you gave me permission,
didn't you?

777
00:54:37,549 --> 00:54:40,946
Say, what are you doing here, now?

778
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,345
It bothered me, too.

779
00:54:43,944 --> 00:54:46,209
I wanted to save some time
for both of us.

780
00:54:46,543 --> 00:54:47,909
There are the gloves, Lieutenant.

781
00:54:48,008 --> 00:54:50,473
I found them in one of Carol's
bureau drawers.

782
00:55:09,994 --> 00:55:13,725
Whaddya know about that?
We covered every inch of that bureau.

783
00:55:15,025 --> 00:55:16,624
We must have missed these.

784
00:55:19,089 --> 00:55:21,388
You didn't find the dress by any
chance, did you?

785
00:55:21,687 --> 00:55:24,286
No, I turned the place upside down.
It's not here.

786
00:55:25,385 --> 00:55:27,284
I wonder what she did with it.

787
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,248
I'm afraid I have no idea.

788
00:55:31,781 --> 00:55:33,946
Why don't we both take another look?

789
00:55:34,879 --> 00:55:35,545
Lieutenant...

790
00:55:36,845 --> 00:55:39,376
It's not in the apartment. I went
through every one of the closets.

791
00:55:39,476 --> 00:55:42,074
There's a laundry hamper in the
bedroom, isn't there?

792
00:55:42,941 --> 00:55:43,906
But I just told you...

793
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,972
Well, there's no harm in checking,
is there?

794
00:55:54,033 --> 00:55:58,597
Lieutenant, would you mind getting that?
I don't feel like talking to anyone.

795
00:56:08,491 --> 00:56:09,624
Rodeo Cleaners.

796
00:56:11,189 --> 00:56:12,388
Ah...Doctor.

797
00:56:16,286 --> 00:56:17,252
How much do I owe you?

798
00:56:17,352 --> 00:56:18,218
4.50

799
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:21,482
Keep the change.

800
00:56:21,582 --> 00:56:22,382
Thank you.

801
00:56:37,539 --> 00:56:39,471
Say, isn't that your wife's dress?

802
00:56:45,867 --> 00:56:47,033
Of course.

803
00:56:48,732 --> 00:56:51,164
She must have put it outside
for the cleaners,

804
00:56:51,264 --> 00:56:52,829
when she got back from the airport.

805
00:56:52,996 --> 00:56:56,393
Yes, that makes sense, it certainly
matches the description.

806
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:57,726
May I take a look?

807
00:56:57,826 --> 00:56:59,391
Take a good look at it, Lieutenant.

808
00:57:00,657 --> 00:57:02,590
Well, I've gotta get back to my office.

809
00:57:03,423 --> 00:57:05,921
I guess we've both wasted
a lot of time.

810
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:09,851
Well, listen. I'm sorry about
all of this, Doctor.

811
00:57:10,518 --> 00:57:12,950
I seem to be making a pest of myself.

812
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,979
Yes? Oh, Lieutenant.

813
00:57:20,545 --> 00:57:21,411
It's for you.

814
00:57:27,074 --> 00:57:28,240
Yeah, thanks.

815
00:57:28,607 --> 00:57:30,972
Columbo...yeah...

816
00:57:32,871 --> 00:57:33,603
Who?

817
00:57:36,135 --> 00:57:37,168
Are you sure?

818
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,932
Yeah, whaddya know about that.

819
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:46,562
All right.

820
00:57:47,161 --> 00:57:49,060
Yes, I'll be right down, yeah.

821
00:57:51,792 --> 00:57:52,958
That does it, Doc.

822
00:57:54,124 --> 00:57:54,857
Does what?

823
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:56,922
We just got a confession.

824
00:57:57,488 --> 00:57:59,554
A fella just admitted killing your wife.

825
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:05,750
Listen, I gotta go, ah... If I get
any more information, I'll call you!

826
00:58:09,914 --> 00:58:12,112
Isn't that funny the way those things
happen...

827
00:58:24,371 --> 00:58:25,870
How did you break the window, Tommy?

828
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:29,301
I had this flashlight.
I knocked it through the glass.

829
00:58:30,567 --> 00:58:31,666
What happened next?

830
00:58:32,332 --> 00:58:33,299
I told you.

831
00:58:34,165 --> 00:58:35,264
She came out.

832
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:37,896
I didn't think she'd be home.

833
00:58:38,562 --> 00:58:39,928
You mean, Mrs.Flemming.

834
00:58:40,194 --> 00:58:41,027
Yeah.

835
00:58:41,593 --> 00:58:44,159
She was wearin' this nightgown.

836
00:58:45,258 --> 00:58:45,991
Go on.

837
00:58:46,257 --> 00:58:49,655
Well, the second she saw me, she
started to yell her head off.

838
00:58:50,455 --> 00:58:52,220
So I ran over to keep her quiet.

839
00:58:54,153 --> 00:58:55,918
I put my hand over her mouth.

840
00:58:57,916 --> 00:59:02,313
And then I...I just strangled her.

841
00:59:02,447 --> 00:59:04,112
Uh-huh.
Then what happened?

842
00:59:04,346 --> 00:59:07,277
Like I said, I began taking things.

843
00:59:08,243 --> 00:59:14,273
The silverware, a couple of candle holders,
a couple of lighters, and the jewelry.

844
00:59:14,739 --> 00:59:16,438
Did you take any money, Tommy?

845
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:19,237
Yeah. She had about 30 bucks
in her purse.

846
00:59:19,369 --> 00:59:21,502
What'd you do with the stuff you
stole?

847
00:59:22,101 --> 00:59:22,901
I fenced it.

848
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:23,766
Where?

849
00:59:25,133 --> 00:59:26,365
Why should I get him in trouble.

850
00:59:26,465 --> 00:59:27,631
What did he give you for it?

851
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:30,496
Look, Lieutenant, how many times
do we have to go over this?

852
00:59:30,596 --> 00:59:32,994
I told you I killed her,
that oughtta be enough.

853
00:59:33,094 --> 00:59:36,725
Tommy, why that particular apartment?

854
00:59:38,923 --> 00:59:40,722
I saw them leaving with their luggage.

855
00:59:41,455 --> 00:59:43,687
The initials on his bag said R.F.

856
00:59:44,121 --> 00:59:48,051
So I looked at the mail boxes and
I saw Dr.Ray Flemming, penthouse.

857
00:59:48,784 --> 00:59:50,749
The only name that fit the initials.

858
00:59:51,015 --> 00:59:52,682
That was pretty shrewd of you.

859
00:59:52,914 --> 00:59:55,546
How many jobs have you had in the
past few months?

860
00:59:56,612 --> 00:59:57,412
One or two.

861
00:59:57,645 --> 01:00:00,577
If I was working steady, would I be
breaking into apartments?

862
01:00:03,142 --> 01:00:04,474
No, I guess you wouldn't.

863
01:00:04,774 --> 01:00:06,439
All right. That's all.
You can take him out.

864
01:00:14,234 --> 01:00:15,434
That was quick.

865
01:00:17,466 --> 01:00:19,598
Well, you've been very cooperative,
Tommy.

866
01:00:34,988 --> 01:00:35,954
What do you think, Doc?

867
01:00:37,686 --> 01:00:39,485
I don't believe a word he says.

868
01:00:42,683 --> 01:00:45,048
Really? Why?

869
01:00:46,847 --> 01:00:48,313
He knew exactly what was stolen.

870
01:00:48,413 --> 01:00:50,311
He knew how the thief got
into the apartment,

871
01:00:50,411 --> 01:00:52,011
he knew what your wife
was wearing...

872
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:54,142
So does everyone who reads the
papers.

873
01:00:55,408 --> 01:00:58,640
Yes, that's...
That's true, that's true.

874
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:00,838
The boy's obviously neurotic.

875
01:01:01,937 --> 01:01:04,303
Some people have an urge to confess
after every murder...

876
01:01:04,402 --> 01:01:06,002
I've even treated a few of them.

877
01:01:06,801 --> 01:01:09,965
They have a compulsion to purge
themselves.

878
01:01:10,732 --> 01:01:12,531
Maybe they just wanna get their names
in the papers.

879
01:01:12,631 --> 01:01:14,496
But the boy's story
does not hold up.

880
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:16,795
You know, you might be right.

881
01:01:17,561 --> 01:01:19,093
You know, come to think of it,

882
01:01:19,692 --> 01:01:25,423
didn't he say that your wife was screaming
and he put his hand over her mouth.

883
01:01:26,289 --> 01:01:29,354
Then he said he lowered his hands
and he strangled her.

884
01:01:30,153 --> 01:01:32,052
I don't know what you're getting at.

885
01:01:34,184 --> 01:01:36,050
Your wife was strangled from behind.

886
01:01:37,282 --> 01:01:40,446
There were thumb indentations marks on
the back of her neck, not on the front.

887
01:01:42,211 --> 01:01:44,110
Oh, and I checked one more thing, Doc.

888
01:01:44,611 --> 01:01:48,008
Tommy was discharged from the Army
on a Section 8. He's mentally unstable.

889
01:01:48,508 --> 01:01:50,440
If you knew that, why do you ask
what I thought?

890
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,339
Oh, well, I uh...

891
01:01:53,371 --> 01:01:56,836
I just wanted to get another professional
opinion, Doc. I mean... no offense.

892
01:01:57,469 --> 01:02:00,533
I don't have to be a psychiatrist to
know the boy's lying.

893
01:02:01,034 --> 01:02:01,832
Why not?

894
01:02:03,032 --> 01:02:05,031
For one thing I have no initials on
my luggage.

895
01:02:05,331 --> 01:02:07,096
Oh, yeah, I was gonna check that out,

896
01:02:07,196 --> 01:02:09,294
if you told me that you believed
Tommy's story.

897
01:02:09,861 --> 01:02:11,227
I thought you might.

898
01:02:11,826 --> 01:02:15,758
It also occurred to me that you may have
planted this whole Tommy episode.

899
01:02:16,157 --> 01:02:18,689
Now, why on earth would I do
a thing like that?

900
01:02:30,647 --> 01:02:33,746
Oh, that reminds me. Did you do any
fishing while you were in Acapulco?

901
01:02:35,212 --> 01:02:36,378
A little. Why?

902
01:02:36,744 --> 01:02:38,676
Oh, it's nothing important,
it's just that...

903
01:02:39,409 --> 01:02:41,341
I'm a terrific bug on fishing.

904
01:02:41,441 --> 01:02:44,939
My wife and I were looking for place
to take a vacation this summer.

905
01:02:45,938 --> 01:02:49,435
You see, the trouble with places
around here is that uh...

906
01:02:49,969 --> 01:02:53,600
People keep dumping all kinds of thing
off the boats. You know, bottles, cans...

907
01:02:53,699 --> 01:02:55,765
It's a terrible shame, criminal.

908
01:02:55,999 --> 01:03:00,396
And uh...I suppose you don't notice that
in the ocean, do ya? I mean uh...

909
01:03:01,128 --> 01:03:04,426
So big, it'll just swallow everything up.

910
01:03:06,025 --> 01:03:07,224
Tell me, uh...

911
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:12,121
Those trade journals and
medical books.

912
01:03:12,821 --> 01:03:14,886
Did you take them with you when you
went fishing?

913
01:03:20,416 --> 01:03:22,481
Lieutenant, for the past week
you've been asking me...

914
01:03:22,581 --> 01:03:24,014
...some rather pointless questions.

915
01:03:24,114 --> 01:03:26,279
I'm getting very tired of them.

916
01:03:27,978 --> 01:03:29,078
I'm sorry, Doc.

917
01:03:29,177 --> 01:03:33,275
I just thought a boat's a good place
to get some reading done.

918
01:03:33,641 --> 01:03:35,573
What do my reading habits have to
do with this?

919
01:03:35,973 --> 01:03:37,138
You've been concentrating on
everything...

920
01:03:37,238 --> 01:03:38,771
...but the man who broke into
my apartment.

921
01:03:39,304 --> 01:03:42,035
Is this some new type of police
procedure?

922
01:03:42,536 --> 01:03:43,568
I'm only uh...

923
01:03:43,702 --> 01:03:47,099
I want the man who murdered my wife.
Everything else is irrelevant.

924
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:48,165
I'm only trying to...

925
01:03:48,265 --> 01:03:50,497
I know. You're only trying to tie up
loose ends.

926
01:03:50,596 --> 01:03:52,196
Well, if you spent a little less time on
loose ends,

927
01:03:52,296 --> 01:03:54,261
maybe you'd come up with
something important.

928
01:03:57,093 --> 01:03:58,159
You know...

929
01:03:58,558 --> 01:04:01,856
Sometimes I get the impression
you think I killed my wife.

930
01:04:04,488 --> 01:04:07,320
You? Oh, no, Doc.

931
01:04:07,986 --> 01:04:09,785
How could you?
You were out of town.

932
01:04:10,917 --> 01:04:12,516
I'm glad you remembered that.

933
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:16,647
Unless you think I hired someone to
kill her.

934
01:04:16,747 --> 01:04:19,945
The boy who confessed.
Maybe I paid him to do it.

935
01:04:20,245 --> 01:04:21,743
No, Doc, you didn't do that.

936
01:04:23,209 --> 01:04:24,142
How do you know?

937
01:04:24,741 --> 01:04:26,441
I already asked him.

938
01:04:33,403 --> 01:04:34,568
Are you serious?

939
01:04:34,669 --> 01:04:35,568
I am.

940
01:04:35,868 --> 01:04:38,134
He's making an absolute pest of
himself.

941
01:04:38,633 --> 01:04:40,831
Telephone calls, question and
answer sessions...

942
01:04:40,932 --> 01:04:43,829
He's even bothering me at the office.
It's getting ridiculous.

943
01:04:44,362 --> 01:04:46,695
He's probably trying too hard.
I'll have a word with him.

944
01:04:46,794 --> 01:04:47,861
A word won't do it.

945
01:04:48,726 --> 01:04:50,959
Burt, you won't believe this,
but somewhere in the back of his mind,

946
01:04:51,058 --> 01:04:52,890
he thinks I'm involved with
Carol's murder.

947
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:54,989
You?
You've got to be kidding.

948
01:04:55,355 --> 01:04:57,754
I'm not, and neither is Columbo.

949
01:04:58,288 --> 01:05:00,753
Look, is there some way you can
get him off my back?

950
01:05:01,286 --> 01:05:02,717
Well, if he's pushing that hard.

951
01:05:02,817 --> 01:05:03,651
He is.

952
01:05:04,449 --> 01:05:06,016
I guess I can pull a few strings.

953
01:05:06,348 --> 01:05:08,048
All right, consider it done.

954
01:05:08,147 --> 01:05:09,413
Well, that was painless.

955
01:05:10,346 --> 01:05:11,845
Looks like I owe you a favor.

956
01:05:11,945 --> 01:05:13,544
Forget it.
What are friends for?

957
01:05:36,763 --> 01:05:37,896
Evening, Doctor.

958
01:05:42,059 --> 01:05:43,392
I just stopped by with some news.

959
01:05:43,492 --> 01:05:45,423
I thought you might be interested...

960
01:05:47,855 --> 01:05:52,119
I got taken off the case today.
I'm no longer workin' on it.

961
01:05:52,852 --> 01:05:53,719
Oh...

962
01:05:54,018 --> 01:05:56,383
It happened all of a sudden, too.

963
01:05:56,683 --> 01:05:59,315
I was sitting at my desk and a call
came down from upstairs.

964
01:05:59,414 --> 01:06:03,179
And they told me that they wanted me
to work on something else. Real strange.

965
01:06:03,979 --> 01:06:06,843
And they told me to turn my files
over to Lieutenant Silver,

966
01:06:06,910 --> 01:06:08,809
who's a very nice guy,
but he's young and...

967
01:06:09,275 --> 01:06:11,374
not experienced in this kinda thing.

968
01:06:12,273 --> 01:06:13,440
That's funny...

969
01:06:14,239 --> 01:06:16,504
Here I thought I was doing
a good job.

970
01:06:16,637 --> 01:06:20,268
How unfortunate for you, but I
suppose they know what they're doing.

971
01:06:20,768 --> 01:06:22,867
You'll have to excuse me.
I've got a dinner engagement.

972
01:06:22,967 --> 01:06:24,199
Where, at the Gordons?

973
01:06:26,631 --> 01:06:27,997
Why do you say that?

974
01:06:28,129 --> 01:06:30,128
Well, you're a good friend of
Mr.Gordon, aren't you?

975
01:06:30,229 --> 01:06:31,194
I mean, uh...

976
01:06:31,494 --> 01:06:34,859
Last week at the hospital, he
invited you over. You remember that?

977
01:06:35,859 --> 01:06:37,357
No, it isn't the Gordons.

978
01:06:37,457 --> 01:06:40,223
No? A lady friend, maybe?

979
01:06:41,921 --> 01:06:43,520
I don't think it's any of your
business.

980
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:45,119
No, I guess not.

981
01:06:46,052 --> 01:06:47,684
I was wondering, Doctor...

982
01:06:48,517 --> 01:06:50,549
Would you take me on as a patient.

983
01:06:52,548 --> 01:06:53,913
Take you on as a what?

984
01:06:54,013 --> 01:06:56,046
You know, I mean it. Maybe you can
help me.

985
01:06:56,245 --> 01:06:58,710
I don't know, there must be
something wrong with me.

986
01:06:58,810 --> 01:07:02,575
I seem to bother people, I seem to
make them nervous.

987
01:07:03,241 --> 01:07:04,806
Maybe you could tell me why.

988
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:06,472
Are you serious?

989
01:07:06,573 --> 01:07:08,338
I'm very very serious.

990
01:07:08,604 --> 01:07:11,203
I've never been more serious
in my life.

991
01:07:13,068 --> 01:07:15,100
My wife says I ought to have it
looked into.

992
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:18,931
So I told her I know this a psychiatrist,
and uh...

993
01:07:19,431 --> 01:07:22,429
I figure if I came here,
like once a week,

994
01:07:22,829 --> 01:07:24,661
maybe we could get it ironed out.

995
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:27,859
You know what I think
the problem is...

996
01:07:29,691 --> 01:07:32,023
I think I'm too suspicious.

997
01:07:32,422 --> 01:07:34,854
I don't trust people, that's my
trouble...

998
01:07:35,254 --> 01:07:37,219
For instance,
when I get taken off a case,

999
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:40,185
right away I figure somebody
put the pressure on...

1000
01:07:40,684 --> 01:07:43,116
...right way, I ask myself why.

1001
01:07:44,614 --> 01:07:46,047
What do you think, Doc?

1002
01:07:46,147 --> 01:07:47,779
I think you'd better get out of
here.

1003
01:07:48,612 --> 01:07:49,379
Beg your pardon?

1004
01:07:49,478 --> 01:07:53,376
Columbo, you're a public servant.
You say you've been taken off the case? Fine.

1005
01:07:53,809 --> 01:07:56,940
Bother me again, and I shall have to
talk to your superiors.

1006
01:07:57,939 --> 01:08:01,137
You've been talking to a lot of people
these days, Doctor.

1007
01:08:11,564 --> 01:08:14,495
Columbo, you're magnificent.
You really are.

1008
01:08:15,795 --> 01:08:17,327
What makes you say that, Doc?

1009
01:08:17,527 --> 01:08:20,225
You are the most persistent
creature I've ever met.

1010
01:08:20,325 --> 01:08:21,092
But likeable.

1011
01:08:21,191 --> 01:08:23,023
The astonishing thing is
you're likeable.

1012
01:08:23,524 --> 01:08:25,422
Has anyone ever told you
you're droll?

1013
01:08:26,388 --> 01:08:26,954
Me?

1014
01:08:27,487 --> 01:08:28,154
Yes, you.

1015
01:08:29,286 --> 01:08:32,484
Oh, come on, Doc...Come on.

1016
01:08:33,017 --> 01:08:35,915
Oh, but you are.
You're a sly little elf.

1017
01:08:36,015 --> 01:08:38,280
You should be sitting under
your own private little toadstool.

1018
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:41,212
You say you've been thrown off
the case,

1019
01:08:41,312 --> 01:08:43,310
and yet you have the flagrant
audacity...

1020
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:45,576
...to come back here and
bother me again.

1021
01:08:45,842 --> 01:08:46,975
I respect that.

1022
01:08:47,075 --> 01:08:48,840
It irritates me, but I respect it.

1023
01:08:50,939 --> 01:08:51,905
How about a drink?

1024
01:08:53,971 --> 01:08:54,870
Well...all right.

1025
01:09:04,897 --> 01:09:07,562
Hey, that's pretty clever.

1026
01:09:08,795 --> 01:09:11,127
You can always have a snort
between patients.

1027
01:09:12,692 --> 01:09:14,758
I haven't given you a Rorschach
test yet,

1028
01:09:14,858 --> 01:09:16,922
but I've got a hunch you're a
bourbon man.

1029
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,686
Thank you very much, Doctor.

1030
01:09:24,018 --> 01:09:25,151
What do we drink to?

1031
01:09:25,851 --> 01:09:26,883
Oh, I don't know.

1032
01:09:28,182 --> 01:09:29,215
How about you and me?

1033
01:09:30,181 --> 01:09:31,080
Fine.

1034
01:09:38,542 --> 01:09:39,842
You like to read huh Doctor?

1035
01:09:40,874 --> 01:09:41,940
Yes, I do.

1036
01:09:42,673 --> 01:09:43,905
You read murder mysteries?

1037
01:09:44,538 --> 01:09:45,504
Not very often.

1038
01:09:45,604 --> 01:09:48,470
Me, I love 'em.
I find 'em nice and relaxing.

1039
01:09:48,902 --> 01:09:52,400
Now, the only trouble is that they got
nothing to do with real life.

1040
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:56,198
I mean, the guy who did it, they
catch him every time.

1041
01:09:56,331 --> 01:09:58,130
You and I know that uh...

1042
01:09:58,396 --> 01:10:00,096
It doesn't always work out
that way.

1043
01:10:00,828 --> 01:10:02,327
You never stop, do you?

1044
01:10:03,393 --> 01:10:04,259
What?

1045
01:10:06,357 --> 01:10:09,456
The insinuations, the change of
pace.

1046
01:10:09,823 --> 01:10:11,254
You're a bag of tricks, Columbo.

1047
01:10:11,354 --> 01:10:13,554
Right down to that prop cigar
you use.

1048
01:10:13,986 --> 01:10:15,386
Oh...come on Doc.

1049
01:10:15,585 --> 01:10:17,350
I'm going to tell you something
about yourself.

1050
01:10:17,917 --> 01:10:20,682
You say you need a psychiatrist.
Maybe you do and maybe you don't.

1051
01:10:21,115 --> 01:10:24,080
But you are the a textbook example of
compensation.

1052
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:24,946
Of what, Doc?

1053
01:10:25,212 --> 01:10:27,744
Compensation. Adaptability.

1054
01:10:28,744 --> 01:10:31,176
You're an intelligent man, Columbo,
but you hide it.

1055
01:10:32,275 --> 01:10:34,673
You pretend you're something
you're not. Why?

1056
01:10:35,339 --> 01:10:36,805
Because of your appearance.

1057
01:10:37,138 --> 01:10:40,336
You think you cannot get by
on looks or polish,

1058
01:10:40,437 --> 01:10:42,967
So you turn that defect into a virtue.

1059
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,300
You take people by surprise.

1060
01:10:45,399 --> 01:10:47,864
They underestimate you and that's
where you trip them up.

1061
01:10:48,198 --> 01:10:49,397
Like coming here tonight.

1062
01:10:52,495 --> 01:10:54,760
Boy, you've got me pegged pretty
good, Doctor.

1063
01:10:55,926 --> 01:10:59,191
I'm gonna have to watch myself with you,
because...

1064
01:10:59,857 --> 01:11:02,322
You figure out people
pretty good.

1065
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:07,019
Now you're trying flattery.

1066
01:11:07,652 --> 01:11:10,251
No, really. I'm serious, Doctor.
You've got a gift.

1067
01:11:10,351 --> 01:11:12,882
I know it's your job and I know
you've studied for years...

1068
01:11:12,982 --> 01:11:15,414
But still it's... well,
it's amazing that...

1069
01:11:15,514 --> 01:11:17,812
a person'll come in here and sit down
and in a couple hours,

1070
01:11:17,912 --> 01:11:18,912
you know all about him.

1071
01:11:19,011 --> 01:11:19,844
Oh, not quite.

1072
01:11:19,944 --> 01:11:21,810
Psychiatry isn't a parlor trick.

1073
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:26,306
Oh, I didn't mean that. No.
I was just wondering...that ah...

1074
01:11:27,506 --> 01:11:30,737
Well, no, I guess that is
impossible.

1075
01:11:30,837 --> 01:11:31,570
What is it?

1076
01:11:32,903 --> 01:11:35,268
Well, I know it's easy enough to
figure out a patient.

1077
01:11:35,368 --> 01:11:37,600
Or a guy like me who's always hanging
around all the time.

1078
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:40,498
But what about a stranger,
what about...

1079
01:11:41,097 --> 01:11:43,663
...a fella that you never
met before?

1080
01:11:44,396 --> 01:11:46,428
Can you tell what makes him tick?

1081
01:11:47,494 --> 01:11:49,525
Any particular one in mind?

1082
01:11:49,625 --> 01:11:52,857
No, nobody special.
Just a type.

1083
01:11:53,323 --> 01:11:55,688
Like a murderer, for instance?

1084
01:11:56,588 --> 01:11:58,786
Well, yeah, now that you mention it.

1085
01:11:59,952 --> 01:12:02,284
I guess we're on the same wave
length.

1086
01:12:02,983 --> 01:12:04,650
Yes, I guess we are.

1087
01:12:05,216 --> 01:12:07,514
What about this hypothetical
murderer?

1088
01:12:08,613 --> 01:12:10,479
Well, I'm not talking about your
average hothead.

1089
01:12:10,579 --> 01:12:12,844
You know, the guy who pops somebody
with a nogging, with a bottle.

1090
01:12:12,944 --> 01:12:14,843
What I mean is a, uh...

1091
01:12:15,442 --> 01:12:19,906
...kind of man that figures
everything out in advance,

1092
01:12:20,007 --> 01:12:23,137
Who takes everything step by step.

1093
01:12:24,703 --> 01:12:27,501
What do you know about that kind
of man, Doctor?

1094
01:12:28,167 --> 01:12:29,300
I should charge you for this.

1095
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:32,431
But since it's on a theoretical basis,
let's just call it...

1096
01:12:32,531 --> 01:12:33,697
...a free consultation...

1097
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:35,630
All right.

1098
01:12:36,496 --> 01:12:39,693
We are talking about a man
who commits a crime...

1099
01:12:40,393 --> 01:12:43,591
not the garden variety of
bar room brawl...

1100
01:12:44,391 --> 01:12:47,688
but an elaborate intellectual
project.

1101
01:12:48,921 --> 01:12:50,554
What do we know about this man?

1102
01:12:51,453 --> 01:12:53,585
Obviously, he's not impulsive.

1103
01:12:53,951 --> 01:12:57,982
He plans, he calculates,
he minimizes risks.

1104
01:12:59,448 --> 01:13:03,445
He's oriented by his mind, not by his
emotions.

1105
01:13:06,444 --> 01:13:09,108
And he's probably well educated,
too.

1106
01:13:09,541 --> 01:13:11,440
Like, maybe, a professional man?

1107
01:13:12,073 --> 01:13:13,238
Like maybe.

1108
01:13:13,672 --> 01:13:16,869
At any rate...an orderly man,
with an eye for detail.

1109
01:13:17,036 --> 01:13:18,135
And courage.

1110
01:13:18,536 --> 01:13:19,435
Courage?

1111
01:13:19,802 --> 01:13:20,701
Certainly.

1112
01:13:21,167 --> 01:13:23,665
To go through a thing like this...
whatever it maybe...

1113
01:13:24,699 --> 01:13:26,763
It takes a strong nervous system.

1114
01:13:27,230 --> 01:13:28,629
Well, you could be right.

1115
01:13:29,662 --> 01:13:31,127
But one thing bothers me, Doctor.

1116
01:13:31,227 --> 01:13:34,259
This man that we're talking about
has taken a human life.

1117
01:13:34,892 --> 01:13:36,824
Wouldn't you say that he was insane?

1118
01:13:37,424 --> 01:13:40,688
Why? Because he committed
an immoral act?

1119
01:13:43,219 --> 01:13:45,385
Morals are conditioned, Lieutenant.

1120
01:13:45,751 --> 01:13:47,917
They're relative, like everything
else is today.

1121
01:13:49,249 --> 01:13:52,347
Our murderer may be as sane as
you and me.

1122
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:54,879
Killing may be repugnant to him.

1123
01:13:56,278 --> 01:13:58,543
But if it's his only solution,
he uses it.

1124
01:13:58,677 --> 01:14:02,374
That's pragmatism my friend,
not insanity.

1125
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:05,472
Tell me, Doctor.

1126
01:14:06,205 --> 01:14:07,804
How do you catch a man like that?

1127
01:14:10,869 --> 01:14:11,702
You don't.

1128
01:14:12,634 --> 01:14:14,267
You're probably right.

1129
01:14:16,399 --> 01:14:18,664
He sounds just too clever for us.

1130
01:14:18,764 --> 01:14:22,261
What I mean is, you know, cops,
we're not the brightest guys in the world.

1131
01:14:23,061 --> 01:14:25,893
Of course, we got one thing going
for us...we're professionals.

1132
01:14:26,192 --> 01:14:28,624
I mean, you take our friend here,
the murderer.

1133
01:14:28,990 --> 01:14:31,889
He's very smart, but he's an amateur.

1134
01:14:32,055 --> 01:14:35,120
I mean he's got just one time to learn,
just one.

1135
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:39,218
With us...well, it's a business.

1136
01:14:39,584 --> 01:14:42,049
You see, we do this a hundred
times a year.

1137
01:14:42,949 --> 01:14:46,879
I tell you Doc, that's a lot of
practice.

1138
01:14:47,746 --> 01:14:49,278
It didn it help you very much,
didn't it?

1139
01:14:49,444 --> 01:14:52,276
I mean with all that experience,
you jumped to the wrong conclusion.

1140
01:14:53,342 --> 01:14:54,041
What do you mean?

1141
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:56,407
I didn't kill my wife.

1142
01:14:58,672 --> 01:15:00,005
I never said you did.

1143
01:15:00,237 --> 01:15:01,436
Oh, that's true.

1144
01:15:01,537 --> 01:15:03,636
Imply, imply is more the word.

1145
01:15:05,268 --> 01:15:07,333
But if I killed my wife...

1146
01:15:08,199 --> 01:15:09,964
And I did say if...

1147
01:15:11,697 --> 01:15:13,762
You're never going to
be able to prove it.

1148
01:15:16,361 --> 01:15:17,993
So why don't we just part as friends?

1149
01:15:18,126 --> 01:15:19,359
You go on to something new,

1150
01:15:19,825 --> 01:15:21,891
and I'll forget this whole thing
ever happened.

1151
01:15:22,490 --> 01:15:25,355
As a matter of fact, there's no reason
for us to see each other again.

1152
01:15:25,888 --> 01:15:27,786
Well I have to be going now.

1153
01:15:28,419 --> 01:15:30,051
I'll go out with you.

1154
01:15:30,185 --> 01:15:34,749
Oh, no, no, no. You just stay here.
Relax. Search the office.

1155
01:15:37,614 --> 01:15:41,711
And if you want another
drink, help yourself.

1156
01:15:42,477 --> 01:15:43,344
Good night.

1157
01:15:47,141 --> 01:15:51,272
Oh, by the way, when you leave,
turn out the light.

1158
01:16:48,569 --> 01:16:49,634
Miss Hudson...

1159
01:16:55,565 --> 01:16:56,464
Who are you?

1160
01:16:57,096 --> 01:17:00,761
Lieutenant Columbo, ma'am.
police.

1161
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:04,991
Ah, we met the other day, remember?

1162
01:17:05,691 --> 01:17:07,157
What's this all about?

1163
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:11,087
Is there some place where we could go,
where we could talk?

1164
01:17:11,954 --> 01:17:12,753
Why?

1165
01:17:12,853 --> 01:17:15,185
Just a few routine questions.
That's all.

1166
01:17:15,285 --> 01:17:16,417
Would you like some ice cream?

1167
01:17:16,651 --> 01:17:18,516
No, thanks...Questions about what?

1168
01:17:18,849 --> 01:17:21,781
Ah, could we go in there?

1169
01:17:46,465 --> 01:17:47,998
This is quite a place.

1170
01:18:01,523 --> 01:18:03,921
Lieutenant, would you mind
telling me why you're here?

1171
01:18:04,987 --> 01:18:05,586
Yes, of course.

1172
01:18:05,686 --> 01:18:08,718
I was hoping you might help us
with a case we're working on.

1173
01:18:09,784 --> 01:18:10,983
What case is that?

1174
01:18:13,782 --> 01:18:14,714
Lieutenant?

1175
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,712
The Flemming case.

1176
01:18:18,878 --> 01:18:21,776
You mean Dr.Flemming, my psychiatrist?

1177
01:18:21,909 --> 01:18:22,642
Uh-huh.

1178
01:18:24,441 --> 01:18:25,974
Is he in some kind of trouble?

1179
01:18:27,439 --> 01:18:28,571
What was that?

1180
01:18:29,505 --> 01:18:31,603
I said, is he in some kind of
trouble?

1181
01:18:31,703 --> 01:18:33,335
Well, you might say yes.

1182
01:18:33,968 --> 01:18:35,501
Sit down, Miss Hudson.

1183
01:18:39,332 --> 01:18:42,130
There's no rule about smoking
here, is there?

1184
01:18:42,263 --> 01:18:43,129
No.

1185
01:18:43,496 --> 01:18:46,993
Well then, if you don't mind,
I'll light up.

1186
01:18:47,559 --> 01:18:49,126
See, a lot of women,
they don't like cigars.

1187
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:52,356
My wife, she prefers a pipe.

1188
01:18:52,523 --> 01:18:54,455
I could never get used to those things.

1189
01:18:54,555 --> 01:18:56,121
There's just too much to carry around
with you.

1190
01:18:59,319 --> 01:19:02,183
How long have you known
Dr.Flemming?

1191
01:19:03,349 --> 01:19:05,115
You mean how long has he been
treating me?

1192
01:19:05,382 --> 01:19:06,914
Well, that's the same thing, isn't
it?

1193
01:19:08,747 --> 01:19:10,545
I've been seeing him for about a
year.

1194
01:19:11,011 --> 01:19:12,543
Uh-huh.

1195
01:19:14,275 --> 01:19:15,608
That checks out.

1196
01:19:16,841 --> 01:19:19,573
By the way, when was the last time
you spoke to Dr.Flemming?

1197
01:19:20,672 --> 01:19:22,237
Last week. When I met you.

1198
01:19:22,637 --> 01:19:24,403
Oh, that's right, yes.

1199
01:19:24,769 --> 01:19:26,302
Lieutenant, would you mind
explaining...

1200
01:19:26,402 --> 01:19:28,234
Are you working here in a movie
now?

1201
01:19:29,367 --> 01:19:30,199
That's right.

1202
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:32,264
Well, I'm gonna have to see it
when it comes out.

1203
01:19:32,365 --> 01:19:36,261
What are you...Are you playing
a Roman girl or a Greek girl?

1204
01:19:36,662 --> 01:19:37,828
Do you do your own makeup?

1205
01:19:38,694 --> 01:19:40,625
What has this got to do with Dr.Flemming?

1206
01:19:40,859 --> 01:19:41,592
Pardon me?

1207
01:19:41,958 --> 01:19:43,890
Lieutenant, you're not being very
clear.

1208
01:19:44,290 --> 01:19:46,955
You came here to ask me about a man
I hardly know.

1209
01:19:47,055 --> 01:19:48,254
You said he was in trouble.

1210
01:19:48,754 --> 01:19:52,185
Now before we go on, suppose you
tell me what kind of trouble.

1211
01:19:52,385 --> 01:19:55,150
Well...I know this is gonna come as
a shock to you.

1212
01:19:56,383 --> 01:19:59,348
But we think that he killed his
wife.

1213
01:20:03,311 --> 01:20:04,544
You seem stunned.

1214
01:20:05,143 --> 01:20:08,308
Of course I'm stunned.
I don't believe it.

1215
01:20:08,542 --> 01:20:09,307
No?

1216
01:20:24,098 --> 01:20:27,563
Yeah, I wonder who these belong to?

1217
01:20:30,461 --> 01:20:32,959
Maybe somebody left them by mistake.

1218
01:20:34,225 --> 01:20:35,158
Miss Hudson...

1219
01:20:38,022 --> 01:20:39,689
You seem nervous.

1220
01:20:40,355 --> 01:20:42,653
Haven't you seen a pair of sunglasses
before?

1221
01:20:44,053 --> 01:20:45,384
Would you like to try them on?

1222
01:20:45,984 --> 01:20:46,750
Why should I?

1223
01:20:46,850 --> 01:20:50,847
No reason. But there's no reason
why you shouldn't either.

1224
01:20:51,547 --> 01:20:52,547
Is there?

1225
01:20:56,245 --> 01:20:57,411
I think I'd better go.

1226
01:20:57,511 --> 01:20:58,876
Sit down, Miss Hudson.

1227
01:20:59,109 --> 01:21:01,874
If you insist on questioning me,
I'm going to have to call my lawyer.

1228
01:21:01,974 --> 01:21:02,840
Sit down!

1229
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:05,239
You can't stop me from calling my
lawyer!

1230
01:21:06,039 --> 01:21:08,970
You have no right to order me around,
you're not even on this case any more!

1231
01:21:09,070 --> 01:21:10,769
How did you know that?

1232
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,366
Dr.Flemming told me.

1233
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:18,231
But you said you haven't seen Dr.
Flemming since last week.

1234
01:21:20,195 --> 01:21:21,595
He called me.

1235
01:21:22,861 --> 01:21:25,526
Oh? Is the doctor in the habit of
doing that?

1236
01:21:26,858 --> 01:21:28,658
I'm not going to answer any more of
your questions.

1237
01:21:28,757 --> 01:21:31,689
Just one more point, Miss Hudson,
that I'd like to clear up.

1238
01:21:31,788 --> 01:21:33,221
I am on the case.

1239
01:21:33,654 --> 01:21:35,586
It's true somebody tried to pull
a few strings.

1240
01:21:35,686 --> 01:21:38,584
But my superior, he doesn't like that.
He gets thinking.

1241
01:21:38,817 --> 01:21:40,449
So he said to me, he said...

1242
01:21:40,549 --> 01:21:44,747
Lieutenant Columbo, you must be
touching a sore spot.

1243
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:46,879
So you just keep right on trying.

1244
01:21:47,845 --> 01:21:49,810
He's very intelligent, my superior.

1245
01:21:50,943 --> 01:21:52,508
I want to call my lawyer.

1246
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:55,340
I don't understand that.

1247
01:21:56,172 --> 01:22:00,371
Dr.Flemming killed his wife
and you wanna call your lawyer,

1248
01:22:01,436 --> 01:22:03,568
Would you explain that to me,
Miss Hudson?

1249
01:22:04,368 --> 01:22:06,367
I want to call my lawyer.

1250
01:22:07,432 --> 01:22:08,165
All right.

1251
01:22:10,397 --> 01:22:11,297
Go ahead.

1252
01:22:16,526 --> 01:22:18,958
If he wants to know
what the charge is...

1253
01:22:20,258 --> 01:22:22,156
it's accessory to murder.

1254
01:22:24,022 --> 01:22:26,254
Go ahead and make your call,
Miss Hudson.

1255
01:22:26,354 --> 01:22:28,652
When you get done we'll take a
drive.

1256
01:22:30,384 --> 01:22:31,217
Drive?

1257
01:22:31,584 --> 01:22:33,083
Yes, we're gonna go see the
stewardess.

1258
01:22:33,183 --> 01:22:37,247
I don't have the blue dress
and I don't have the gloves.

1259
01:22:38,412 --> 01:22:40,777
I don't think, you're going to try on
these sunglasses.

1260
01:22:40,877 --> 01:22:45,042
But maybe she'll remember you any
how, wig or no wig.

1261
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:55,768
I don't know what you're
talking about.

1262
01:22:56,468 --> 01:22:58,067
You're trying to confuse me.

1263
01:22:59,266 --> 01:23:00,699
I've nothing to do with this.

1264
01:23:01,098 --> 01:23:01,898
With what?

1265
01:23:02,197 --> 01:23:05,129
With this... with the thing
you said about Ray.

1266
01:23:05,229 --> 01:23:05,995
Ray?

1267
01:23:06,295 --> 01:23:07,394
Dr.Flemming!

1268
01:23:07,827 --> 01:23:09,227
But you just called him "Ray."

1269
01:23:09,893 --> 01:23:13,424
What difference does that make?
I know him, he's my doctor.

1270
01:23:13,524 --> 01:23:14,389
Your lover?

1271
01:23:15,022 --> 01:23:15,956
My doctor!

1272
01:23:16,056 --> 01:23:17,955
And you said you never met his wife?

1273
01:23:18,254 --> 01:23:20,086
No, I never met his wife!

1274
01:23:20,186 --> 01:23:21,519
Would you like to see some
pictures of her.

1275
01:23:21,619 --> 01:23:24,217
I had them taken at the morgue.
They're in my briefcase.

1276
01:23:24,650 --> 01:23:25,449
No!

1277
01:23:25,549 --> 01:23:26,182
Why should you?

1278
01:23:26,282 --> 01:23:29,514
After all, you saw the real thing.
That must have been quite a shock.

1279
01:23:29,614 --> 01:23:31,912
Why don't you leave me alone?
I didn't do anything.

1280
01:23:32,012 --> 01:23:32,645
No?

1281
01:23:33,011 --> 01:23:36,609
What about these?
What about the sunglasses?

1282
01:23:37,542 --> 01:23:39,674
What about the overweight luggage?

1283
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:42,039
What about the argument on the
plane?

1284
01:23:42,172 --> 01:23:43,205
I don't wanna listen to
any of this!

1285
01:23:43,305 --> 01:23:46,336
Now, you were there when he
strangled her, weren't you?

1286
01:23:46,436 --> 01:23:46,936
No!

1287
01:23:47,036 --> 01:23:49,035
Well, does that mean
that you came later?

1288
01:23:49,267 --> 01:23:50,600
I was never there at all.

1289
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:51,966
I think you were.

1290
01:23:52,666 --> 01:23:56,130
I think you probably changed into
her dress while she was lying there.

1291
01:23:56,230 --> 01:23:58,095
Then you and the Doctor went to the
airport and...

1292
01:23:58,196 --> 01:24:00,993
...had that fake argument on the plane.
Didn't you?

1293
01:24:01,426 --> 01:24:04,325
Didn't you.
Didn't you help plan it with him,

1294
01:24:04,491 --> 01:24:07,256
Didn't you help carry it out
with him? Now didn't you?

1295
01:24:07,356 --> 01:24:07,989
Stop it!

1296
01:24:08,089 --> 01:24:10,054
Without you that woman would be alive.

1297
01:24:10,221 --> 01:24:12,586
Without you she wouldn't be lying
in the morgue.

1298
01:24:13,119 --> 01:24:14,485
Stop it!

1299
01:24:27,076 --> 01:24:30,009
Why don't we go downtown,
and you can make a statement.

1300
01:24:44,566 --> 01:24:45,431
No!

1301
01:24:46,831 --> 01:24:48,364
You have no right!

1302
01:24:51,028 --> 01:24:53,894
I have nothing to do with this.
Do you understand?

1303
01:24:53,993 --> 01:24:54,926
Nothing.

1304
01:24:55,225 --> 01:24:56,392
Nothing at all...

1305
01:24:57,991 --> 01:25:00,889
If you want to take me to the
stewardess, then take me.

1306
01:25:01,788 --> 01:25:03,786
If you want to arrest me, go ahead.

1307
01:25:04,087 --> 01:25:06,019
But you can't prove anything.

1308
01:25:08,417 --> 01:25:10,883
Now either charge me or let me leave.

1309
01:25:11,349 --> 01:25:12,981
I don't care what you do.

1310
01:25:19,611 --> 01:25:20,376
You can go.

1311
01:25:30,669 --> 01:25:31,703
Miss Hudson...

1312
01:25:33,801 --> 01:25:36,633
I hope you understand this is only
the beginning...

1313
01:25:37,066 --> 01:25:38,598
In a way, I feel sorry for you.

1314
01:25:38,698 --> 01:25:41,963
Because from now on I'm gonna do
everything I can to break you down.

1315
01:25:42,063 --> 01:25:43,129
Do you understand?

1316
01:25:43,928 --> 01:25:46,327
Dr.Flemming made one mistake and
you're it.

1317
01:25:46,693 --> 01:25:48,692
You're the weak link, Miss Hudson.

1318
01:25:49,657 --> 01:25:52,523
You surprised me today, because
you were strong.

1319
01:25:53,222 --> 01:25:54,654
But there's always tomorrow.

1320
01:25:55,387 --> 01:25:56,953
And the day after that.

1321
01:25:57,552 --> 01:25:59,085
And the day after that.

1322
01:25:59,984 --> 01:26:02,549
Sooner or later you're gonna talk
to me.

1323
01:26:03,149 --> 01:26:05,714
Until you do you're gonna be
questioned.

1324
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:09,679
You're gonna be followed,
you're gonna be hounded.

1325
01:26:10,911 --> 01:26:13,343
Dr.Flemming can't do anything
about it.

1326
01:26:13,976 --> 01:26:15,808
You're on your own, Miss Hudson.

1327
01:26:16,874 --> 01:26:21,704
And I'm going to get to him
through you...that's a promise.

1328
01:28:37,584 --> 01:28:41,149
Ray, thank heavens.
I've been calling for hours.

1329
01:28:41,749 --> 01:28:43,114
What's wrong?
You sound upset.

1330
01:28:43,447 --> 01:28:45,645
Columbo came to see me
at the studio today.

1331
01:28:47,212 --> 01:28:48,077
Columbo?

1332
01:28:48,844 --> 01:28:50,210
He tried to break me down.

1333
01:28:50,542 --> 01:28:51,775
Did you tell him anything?

1334
01:28:51,875 --> 01:28:53,174
No, of course not.

1335
01:28:53,308 --> 01:28:56,772
But he knows. Every detail.
Even the alibi on the plane.

1336
01:28:57,271 --> 01:28:59,670
He's only guessing.
And guesses are no proof.

1337
01:29:00,470 --> 01:29:03,068
Why should he be questioning you?
He's off the case.

1338
01:29:03,168 --> 01:29:05,200
No he's not, he's right in the
middle of it.

1339
01:29:07,299 --> 01:29:09,764
Two of his men are parked outside
right now.

1340
01:29:11,329 --> 01:29:13,195
I think we'd better have a talk.

1341
01:29:13,694 --> 01:29:15,060
Come in tomorrow for your
appointment.

1342
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:16,259
<i>We'll figure some thing out.</i>

1343
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:17,726
Can't you come over here now?

1344
01:29:17,992 --> 01:29:20,724
With his men watching your house?
Joan, use your head.

1345
01:29:20,890 --> 01:29:21,689
But you're my doctor.

1346
01:29:21,789 --> 01:29:23,855
There's nothing wrong in visiting
a patient.

1347
01:29:24,088 --> 01:29:26,686
He obviously expects us to get
together tonight.

1348
01:29:26,786 --> 01:29:28,252
Let's not be predictable.

1349
01:29:29,285 --> 01:29:30,351
What are we going to do?

1350
01:29:30,783 --> 01:29:32,283
Just ride it out.

1351
01:29:32,949 --> 01:29:36,280
You're his last resort.
If you don't panic we're home free.

1352
01:29:37,146 --> 01:29:39,978
Ray, I have to see you.

1353
01:29:40,544 --> 01:29:42,077
You will. In the morning.

1354
01:29:43,209 --> 01:29:45,441
Now put on some music and have
yourself a drink.

1355
01:29:45,541 --> 01:29:47,007
And stop worrying.

1356
01:29:47,373 --> 01:29:48,239
Ray...

1357
01:29:48,539 --> 01:29:49,339
<i>Yes...</i>

1358
01:29:52,769 --> 01:29:55,368
All right, I'll try.

1359
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:08,493
Miss Petrie?

1360
01:30:08,859 --> 01:30:10,658
Doesn't Miss Hudson have a ten
o'clock appointment?

1361
01:30:11,258 --> 01:30:12,224
Yes, she does.

1362
01:30:12,324 --> 01:30:14,256
It's ten-thirty.
Why don't you give her a call?

1363
01:30:27,847 --> 01:30:29,680
Hello? Is Miss Hudson...

1364
01:30:31,112 --> 01:30:32,178
Well, no, I...

1365
01:30:33,644 --> 01:30:36,275
This is the receptionist in
Dr.Flemming's office...

1366
01:30:37,974 --> 01:30:40,106
Well, she had an appointment here
this morning...

1367
01:30:42,904 --> 01:30:43,938
I see.

1368
01:30:48,302 --> 01:30:50,199
I just called Miss Hudson,
and a man answered.

1369
01:30:50,300 --> 01:30:52,299
He said he was from the coroner's
office.

1370
01:30:53,731 --> 01:30:55,796
Try it again.
Maybe you got the wrong number.

1371
01:31:08,988 --> 01:31:12,352
This is Dr.Flemming's office
again. Is Miss Hudson there?

1372
01:31:14,918 --> 01:31:16,350
You don't understand.

1373
01:31:16,683 --> 01:31:18,548
Dr.Flemming is her psychiatrist.

1374
01:31:19,848 --> 01:31:22,079
Well, I'm only trying to get some
information.

1375
01:31:22,746 --> 01:31:23,712
Let me have that!

1376
01:31:24,012 --> 01:31:26,077
Hello, this is Dr.Flemming.
Who are you?

1377
01:31:27,410 --> 01:31:29,408
Miss Hudson is under my care.

1378
01:31:30,574 --> 01:31:31,873
I want to know what happened?

1379
01:31:33,705 --> 01:31:35,671
Look, I am her psychiatrist!

1380
01:31:39,235 --> 01:31:40,801
What kind of accident?

1381
01:31:42,833 --> 01:31:44,466
Well, who do I call to find out?

1382
01:31:45,298 --> 01:31:46,997
Can't you get it through your head...

1383
01:31:48,463 --> 01:31:49,129
Never mind!

1384
01:31:54,226 --> 01:31:56,191
Miss Petrie, I'm going out for a while.

1385
01:31:56,757 --> 01:31:58,689
Tell my next patient I'll be late.

1386
01:32:40,729 --> 01:32:41,662
Where is she?

1387
01:32:42,628 --> 01:32:43,927
I said...where is she?

1388
01:33:10,311 --> 01:33:12,509
She stuffed herself with
barbiturates...

1389
01:33:15,007 --> 01:33:16,173
I didn't think...

1390
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:17,873
What didn't you think?

1391
01:33:41,824 --> 01:33:43,456
You didn't think what?

1392
01:33:45,455 --> 01:33:49,719
I questioned her yesterday...
I guess I pushed her too far.

1393
01:33:49,819 --> 01:33:53,117
I told her that I...
I was gonna get to you through her.

1394
01:33:53,417 --> 01:33:55,348
You had to bring her into this,
didn't you?

1395
01:33:55,715 --> 01:33:57,880
Didn't you know what she'd do?
Or didn't you care?

1396
01:33:57,980 --> 01:33:59,380
Don't lecture me, Doctor!

1397
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:01,312
I'm responsible!
And I'm gonna have to live with it.

1398
01:34:01,411 --> 01:34:02,877
But you're leaving somebody out.

1399
01:34:03,744 --> 01:34:06,209
We both killed that girl, the two
of us together!

1400
01:34:06,375 --> 01:34:09,207
She committed suicide for one
reason...to protect you!

1401
01:34:09,606 --> 01:34:12,838
You see it was all for you,
for you, Doc.

1402
01:34:20,833 --> 01:34:22,465
By the way, congratulations.

1403
01:34:24,197 --> 01:34:25,862
I mean, you're home free now aren't you?

1404
01:34:26,329 --> 01:34:28,095
Boy, it couldn't have worked
out better.

1405
01:34:29,294 --> 01:34:31,659
She was the only one who could have
given you away.

1406
01:34:32,591 --> 01:34:36,489
I can't touch you any more, Doc.
Nobody can. You're free and clear.

1407
01:34:38,022 --> 01:34:39,054
You won, Doc.

1408
01:34:43,584 --> 01:34:46,283
The only trouble is you didn't get
what you were going after.

1409
01:34:50,447 --> 01:34:51,846
What is that supposed to mean?

1410
01:34:52,613 --> 01:34:53,612
The girl.

1411
01:34:55,011 --> 01:34:58,242
You loved her and you wanted her,
and you were willing to murder for her.

1412
01:34:58,342 --> 01:35:02,073
And now she's gone.
All that planning, all that sweat...

1413
01:35:03,472 --> 01:35:05,371
And you wind up with nothing.

1414
01:35:08,002 --> 01:35:09,401
What're you trying to tell me?

1415
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:15,698
I'm not trying to tell you anything,
Doctor. I was just thinking that uh...

1416
01:35:16,764 --> 01:35:19,928
You're going to be a terribly lonely
man from here on in...

1417
01:35:21,027 --> 01:35:24,558
And maybe you'd feel better
if you got a few things off your chest.

1418
01:35:24,759 --> 01:35:25,791
Like what?

1419
01:35:26,524 --> 01:35:27,690
Like the truth.

1420
01:35:29,756 --> 01:35:31,287
Are you asking me to confess?

1421
01:35:31,588 --> 01:35:33,253
Well, is that so strange?

1422
01:35:34,053 --> 01:35:36,284
After all, what do you have to
look forward to?

1423
01:35:36,551 --> 01:35:38,016
Think about that, Doc.

1424
01:35:38,417 --> 01:35:43,013
The girl isn't around any more...and
who knows? Maybe you owe her something.

1425
01:35:54,473 --> 01:35:55,539
What do you say, Doc?

1426
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:05,999
You're a very funny man.

1427
01:36:06,466 --> 01:36:07,732
I wasn't trying to be funny.

1428
01:36:07,897 --> 01:36:09,896
But you are...more than you know.

1429
01:36:10,563 --> 01:36:12,861
So you want me to purge myself.

1430
01:36:13,028 --> 01:36:15,992
My one-and-only love is dead and
I have nothing more to live for.

1431
01:36:16,093 --> 01:36:16,759
Is that it?

1432
01:36:16,859 --> 01:36:19,357
All I'm saying is that if you loved
that girl...

1433
01:36:19,523 --> 01:36:20,989
Loved that girl?

1434
01:36:21,823 --> 01:36:24,154
Look Columbo, I overestimated you.

1435
01:36:24,821 --> 01:36:27,452
I thought you understood about
human nature.

1436
01:36:28,452 --> 01:36:30,150
I never loved that girl.

1437
01:36:30,250 --> 01:36:31,349
Come on, Doc.

1438
01:36:31,882 --> 01:36:32,948
No, really...

1439
01:36:33,581 --> 01:36:36,447
Remember that hypothetical
murderer we were talking about?

1440
01:36:37,046 --> 01:36:38,079
He needed an alibi.

1441
01:36:38,179 --> 01:36:41,476
The girl was available so he used her.
It was as simple as that.

1442
01:36:41,910 --> 01:36:42,742
No.

1443
01:36:43,642 --> 01:36:46,606
You killed your wife
because you were in love with the girl.

1444
01:36:47,672 --> 01:36:51,836
If I killed Carol...and there's no
proof that I did...I did it for myself.

1445
01:36:51,936 --> 01:36:54,069
Not for some dime-a-dozen little
actress.

1446
01:36:54,368 --> 01:36:57,965
She helped you with the murder.
You would've had to marry her.

1447
01:36:59,465 --> 01:37:02,862
Not really. Something would have
been arranged.

1448
01:37:06,061 --> 01:37:08,026
Like an accident, maybe.

1449
01:37:08,559 --> 01:37:11,224
Always planning ahead, aren't you,
Ray?

1450
01:37:34,276 --> 01:37:36,608
They said there was something I
should hear...

1451
01:38:12,119 --> 01:38:13,951
Would you like to make a statement
now?

1452
01:38:24,810 --> 01:38:26,776
Why don't we sit down, we can work
over here.
