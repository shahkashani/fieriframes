1
00:05:34,994 --> 00:05:35,795
You're late.

2
00:05:35,895 --> 00:05:37,562
I'm sorry.
The path out there was dark.

3
00:05:37,662 --> 00:05:38,696
Anybody see you?

4
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,230
No. And I parked
where you told me.

5
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,664
Good. Take that.

6
00:05:52,869 --> 00:05:55,938
Pull yourself together.
There's no reason to be frightened.

7
00:05:56,604 --> 00:05:59,206
It's just my uncle.
And I assure you,

8
00:05:59,306 --> 00:06:02,808
he's far more amiable now
than he ever was when he was alive.

9
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:11,245
I'll be all right.

10
00:06:11,345 --> 00:06:13,346
Of course you will, my love.

11
00:06:14,213 --> 00:06:18,182
I couldn't possibly be any help to
your career from inside a gas chamber.

12
00:06:18,282 --> 00:06:20,416
Don't say things like that.

13
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,852
Anyway, what difference
does my career make?

14
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:28,054
Dale, look,
they're all yours now.

15
00:06:28,153 --> 00:06:31,489
They will be,
but not unless you do your part.

16
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,192
Don't worry, Dale.
I... I was just a little upset.

17
00:06:38,092 --> 00:06:39,860
- Now I'm fine.
- Good.

18
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,594
Now remember,
when you open the window, fire high.

19
00:06:42,994 --> 00:06:43,895
You better get started.

20
00:06:43,995 --> 00:06:45,863
That electric blanket
goes back upstairs...

21
00:06:45,963 --> 00:06:49,631
Top drawer, left side. How many times
have you told me that? Dale, hurry!

22
00:08:18,675 --> 00:08:23,245
All right, Melvin,
5,000 and it's a steal.

23
00:08:23,845 --> 00:08:26,813
Would you please move faster?
Uh, boys, keep those bottles popping.

24
00:08:26,913 --> 00:08:28,714
Thank you. Good evening.

25
00:08:29,815 --> 00:08:33,884
One thousand dollars?
And you're not even a Frenchman.

26
00:08:33,984 --> 00:08:36,050
Well, you see, the only thing
I really need is...

27
00:08:36,151 --> 00:08:38,719
something pink
for the guest bathroom.

28
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:42,220
I just paint the pictures, ma'am,
I don't set prices.

29
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,221
Don't pick on my artist, darling.

30
00:08:44,321 --> 00:08:46,823
After all, your husband
adores cactus. He told me so.

31
00:08:46,923 --> 00:08:50,057
I know, but it's the wrong shade
of pink for the wallpaper.

32
00:08:50,158 --> 00:08:51,492
Well, how about 800?

33
00:08:51,592 --> 00:08:54,960
I mean, that's if he takes
the green Indian to go in the office.

34
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,128
Mind you... I'm so glad you...

35
00:08:57,228 --> 00:08:58,962
Oh, excuse me.

36
00:08:59,696 --> 00:09:03,565
Dale! Dale Kingston,
I don't believe it.

37
00:09:03,665 --> 00:09:07,133
Your invitation said free champagne,
Mitilda, my love.

38
00:09:07,233 --> 00:09:10,735
Oh, you're such a snob. You never
come to my showings. Sam, quick!

39
00:09:10,835 --> 00:09:12,602
Well, I had nothing to do
tonight anyway.

40
00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:14,103
I was half hoping that
it'd be over by...

41
00:09:14,203 --> 00:09:18,138
Oh, it's just begun.
Please, Dale. Excuse me.

42
00:09:18,238 --> 00:09:21,507
Sam... This is Sam Franklin.

43
00:09:21,607 --> 00:09:24,809
It's his first private showing,
so would you please be nice?

44
00:09:24,909 --> 00:09:26,776
Honey, this is Dale Kingston.

45
00:09:26,876 --> 00:09:29,111
- How do you do?
- Yes, yes. How do you do, sir?

46
00:09:29,211 --> 00:09:33,847
Oh, you must be the artist of these,
uh, arid little landscapes, aren't you?

47
00:09:33,946 --> 00:09:36,014
Well, they're not too bad.
Not too bad at all.

48
00:09:36,114 --> 00:09:40,383
- Mr. Kingston? Mr. Dale Kingston?
- Yes.

49
00:09:40,483 --> 00:09:42,517
And you're the famous art critic?

50
00:09:42,617 --> 00:09:45,119
Well, as of the moment, yes,
whatever the moment happens to be...

51
00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:49,621
Of course he is, darling, and you're
already raving about Sam's work.

52
00:09:49,721 --> 00:09:50,822
I'm sorry, dear.

53
00:09:50,922 --> 00:09:54,690
But you couldn't possibly have
this cactus for a penny less than 12.

54
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,492
- I have five minutes to 11:00, sir.
- Five to 11:00.

55
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:01,427
- Yes.
- So it is.

56
00:10:01,527 --> 00:10:04,495
Thank you very much, Mr., uh, Franklin.

57
00:10:05,462 --> 00:10:07,564
- Oh, of course you'd love champagne.
- Oh, you bet.

58
00:10:07,664 --> 00:10:09,198
Sam, the painting.

59
00:10:44,315 --> 00:10:49,484
And so that the meaning of the mobile
stems not only from its form,

60
00:10:49,585 --> 00:10:53,720
but the relationship between the pieces,
which gives it its meaning.

61
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:59,223
And I suppose the relationship between
the pieces is really where it's at, isn't it?

62
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,927
Yes.

63
00:12:56,714 --> 00:12:58,916
It's not so much a question of
his masculinity.

64
00:12:59,016 --> 00:13:02,217
I think the artist
just saw him that way.

65
00:13:03,084 --> 00:13:04,785
I'll drink to that.

66
00:13:17,091 --> 00:13:19,726
You notice no matter
how abstract the painter,

67
00:13:19,825 --> 00:13:23,028
he always signs his name
realistically, doesn't he?

68
00:13:23,662 --> 00:13:25,229
Of course.

69
00:13:57,245 --> 00:13:59,413
- Were you home tonight?
- Oh, no, sir.

70
00:13:59,513 --> 00:14:03,515
My wife and I left the house at 8:00.
It's our regular night off.

71
00:14:03,615 --> 00:14:06,616
There's just you and your wife?
No other servants in a place this size?

72
00:14:06,716 --> 00:14:09,484
Well, Mr. Matthews seldom entertained.

73
00:14:09,584 --> 00:14:12,953
He was divorced many years ago
and has very few friends.

74
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:15,688
Tonight I believe he planned
to spend in his room reading.

75
00:14:15,787 --> 00:14:16,821
Just a minute.

76
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:19,323
You got all this, Columbo?
You want anything more from Mr. Evans?

77
00:14:19,423 --> 00:14:20,356
No.

78
00:14:23,191 --> 00:14:24,558
Please, sir!

79
00:14:25,592 --> 00:14:29,094
Mr. Matthews was very fussy
about smoking.

80
00:14:29,194 --> 00:14:31,195
Oh, sorry.

81
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:34,263
Oh, Doctor,
call us from downtown, will ya?

82
00:14:34,363 --> 00:14:37,265
Oh, I don't think the autopsy
will change my opinion.

83
00:14:37,365 --> 00:14:40,633
It was a single bullet.
Must've died almost instantly.

84
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:41,733
And the time of death?

85
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,435
Oh, I'd say around 11:00,
give or take a few minutes.

86
00:14:44,535 --> 00:14:47,703
- Wasn't it?
- Yeah. The body was still warm.

87
00:14:47,869 --> 00:14:49,538
Talk to you later, Captain.

88
00:14:50,972 --> 00:14:56,074
Oh, Mr. Kingston. I've been trying to
reach you. I'm so terribly sorry.

89
00:14:56,174 --> 00:14:59,509
- Somebody broke in, I assume?
- Yes, your uncle probably came down...

90
00:14:59,609 --> 00:15:03,044
I told him about it. He just got back to
his apartment at 2:00,

91
00:15:03,144 --> 00:15:06,079
after some party at a gallery, he says.

92
00:15:06,512 --> 00:15:10,114
There are two paintings missing, I think.
I told them to hold everything for you.

93
00:15:10,214 --> 00:15:14,550
Mr. Kingston, we've been waiting to dust
some of these canvases for fingerprints.

94
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,651
Evans wouldn't let us
touch anything but the frames.

95
00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:17,585
Well, it's perfectly all right.

96
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:20,019
No problem as long as you're careful.
Which ones did you want?

97
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,320
These right here.

98
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,854
I suppose he's gonna be
your new boss, huh?

99
00:15:23,954 --> 00:15:27,256
Well, I would hope he keeps on
and keeps the house.

100
00:15:27,357 --> 00:15:30,658
After all, he's Mr. Matthews's
only living relative.

101
00:15:30,925 --> 00:15:34,360
- But, really, sir, at a time like this...
- Oh, listen. I'm sorry.

102
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,361
Of course. You're absolutely right.

103
00:15:36,461 --> 00:15:40,229
Would you like to spend some time with
your wife? I'm sure she's very upset.

104
00:15:40,329 --> 00:15:41,696
Thank you.

105
00:15:43,231 --> 00:15:46,299
Uh, Mr. Kingston,
before you get too involved there...

106
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,799
- Excuse me a minute, Captain.
- Okay.

107
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:51,968
I wonder if maybe first you'd try to
help me out with a problem I have?

108
00:15:52,068 --> 00:15:56,104
- Yes.
- Um, it's this...

109
00:15:56,704 --> 00:15:59,872
- This painting.
- Well, what's the problem?

110
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:02,774
Haven't you ever seen people
without faces before?

111
00:16:03,508 --> 00:16:04,908
They've loaned them out.

112
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:08,010
You've heard of two-faced people,
I suppose?

113
00:16:08,477 --> 00:16:10,845
Oh, yes. But, uh...

114
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,179
You see, it's this
crazy signature that bothers me...

115
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:17,248
DeGrote. George DeGrote.
Quite famous.

116
00:16:17,448 --> 00:16:20,950
I thought so. Isn't that funny?

117
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:25,185
'Cause I noticed the signatures
on this other painting, um...

118
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,888
- Does that say Birnbaum?
- Yes, it does.

119
00:16:30,988 --> 00:16:34,556
That's what I thought.
"Birnbaum."

120
00:16:34,656 --> 00:16:37,991
You'd think that these artists
would be able to write more clearly.

121
00:16:38,091 --> 00:16:42,127
Really, do you think all this is
quite appropriate at this time, Mr....

122
00:16:42,227 --> 00:16:46,896
Oh, I guess not. Uh, I realize this has been
a terrible shock for you.

123
00:16:46,996 --> 00:16:50,531
- I wanna express my deepest sympathies.
- Thank you, Mr....

124
00:16:50,631 --> 00:16:53,966
- Lieutenant Columbo.
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

125
00:16:54,433 --> 00:16:58,702
Uh, tell me, Mr. Kingston,
has anybody tried to rob this place before?

126
00:16:58,802 --> 00:17:02,170
Certainly. This place is
a magnet for art thieves.

127
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,038
It's one of the finest collections
in the world.

128
00:17:04,238 --> 00:17:09,174
Is that so?
Really? Very impressive.

129
00:17:10,908 --> 00:17:15,244
You seem inordinately fascinated
by these paintings.

130
00:17:15,344 --> 00:17:18,345
Well, I'll tell you what bothers me.
You see, it's this.

131
00:17:18,445 --> 00:17:23,481
If you came in here to grab some paintings,
wouldn't you grab a DeGrote first...

132
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,548
instead of a Birnbaum?

133
00:17:25,948 --> 00:17:28,550
Perhaps.
But then, I'm an art critic.

134
00:17:29,418 --> 00:17:33,819
- You're the detective.
- You're the art critic. That's right.

135
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,188
And I'm gonna need a lot of your help.
I suppose you noticed that already.

136
00:17:37,288 --> 00:17:42,223
Uh, like in there, there's two little frames
and they're empty,

137
00:17:42,323 --> 00:17:45,792
and there doesn't seem to be
anything around that fits inside.

138
00:17:47,026 --> 00:17:49,127
Oh, no.

139
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,628
Now, Mr. Evans wasn't quite sure either.

140
00:17:51,728 --> 00:17:54,329
He thought that one of 'em
had some dancing girls.

141
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,697
But I don't think
he knows much about art either.

142
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:00,032
He also said that a lot of these things
had just been rehung.

143
00:18:00,132 --> 00:18:02,133
That they'd just come back from
some kind of a traveling exhibit?

144
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:04,268
Yes, that's what those crates are
out in the hall there.

145
00:18:04,368 --> 00:18:06,402
I unpacked most of them myself.

146
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,904
You know, I noticed that a piece of that
wrapping paper had been torn loose.

147
00:18:10,004 --> 00:18:13,173
These two are listed
in the exhibit catalogue.

148
00:18:14,506 --> 00:18:16,507
Got that in here somewhere.

149
00:18:19,675 --> 00:18:20,743
Here, look.

150
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,811
- Those were the two that were taken?
- Yes.

151
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:28,613
- Hey, they're beautiful.
- They're two of my favorites. Degas pastels.

152
00:18:28,713 --> 00:18:32,415
Pastels? You mean like
the kids use in school?

153
00:18:32,715 --> 00:18:35,217
Nobody ever used pastels
like Degas, Lieutenant.

154
00:18:35,317 --> 00:18:38,885
These two alone together happen to be worth
over a half million dollars.

155
00:18:41,853 --> 00:18:44,321
- You know, that's funny too.
- Not at all.

156
00:18:44,421 --> 00:18:47,789
There isn't a painting in this entire exhibit
that's worth under 50,000.

157
00:18:47,889 --> 00:18:52,459
No, I mean that out there,
somebody picked a Birnbaum first.

158
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,326
Then when your uncle interfered,

159
00:18:54,626 --> 00:18:57,161
then when he went to his desk
and took out a gun,

160
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:01,097
then when he was killed...
in the middle of all that, then...

161
00:19:01,197 --> 00:19:03,497
the thief suddenly got smart,

162
00:19:03,764 --> 00:19:06,933
and he took two of the most valuable
paintings in the house and he ran.

163
00:19:07,866 --> 00:19:10,668
Guess that does seem
a bit inconsistent, doesn't it?

164
00:19:10,768 --> 00:19:13,369
Then life has its own inconsistencies.

165
00:19:13,469 --> 00:19:18,438
- Lt. Columbo?
- Oh, Sally, nice of you to come.

166
00:19:19,438 --> 00:19:21,906
Let's go out back. I wanna try something.

167
00:19:22,273 --> 00:19:25,309
Uh, Mr. Kingston,
you might be interested in this.

168
00:19:26,642 --> 00:19:30,044
- Uh, you were here?
- Yeah, that's right.

169
00:19:30,144 --> 00:19:32,512
- Wait there. I'll holler.
- All right.

170
00:19:35,314 --> 00:19:37,647
Hi. Hi, Charlie. How are you?

171
00:19:37,814 --> 00:19:39,249
What's all this?

172
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:43,384
Well, you see, they have private patrolmen
here to make checks at every hour.

173
00:19:43,484 --> 00:19:45,751
- At 11:00...
- No, no, no. I mean this, this, this.

174
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,486
- What? Oh, the lock?
- Yes.

175
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,087
Well, you see, he found that open.

176
00:19:49,187 --> 00:19:52,655
The lock was scarred like
it'd been forced from the outside.

177
00:19:52,755 --> 00:19:56,424
Of course, what I don't understand
is why the burglar alarm didn't go off.

178
00:19:56,524 --> 00:19:58,892
A professional thief could
manage that pretty well, couldn't he?

179
00:19:58,992 --> 00:20:01,960
No, no, no. You see, professionals,
they always pick windows.

180
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,393
They're just easier to crack.

181
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:05,229
- Sally, are you ready?
- Whenever you are.

182
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:09,530
Okay. When I holler inside,
you run just the way I told you to run.

183
00:20:09,964 --> 00:20:12,532
Okay! Here she goes!

184
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:31,541
- Well?
- That's it. That's what I heard.

185
00:20:31,641 --> 00:20:35,244
I couldn't be sure before.
I was running myself.

186
00:20:35,344 --> 00:20:38,612
- Now you heard high heels on those stone steps?
- Yes, sir.

187
00:20:38,712 --> 00:20:40,012
- Thank you very much.
- You bet.

188
00:20:40,112 --> 00:20:41,913
- Charlie, will you get Sally?
- Wait a minute.

189
00:20:42,013 --> 00:20:45,414
- You mean, you think the thief was a woman?
- One of 'em.

190
00:20:45,815 --> 00:20:46,716
One of them?

191
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:50,117
Well, there were too many pictures for
one person to carry, don't you think?

192
00:20:50,818 --> 00:20:52,785
And besides, the burglar alarm thing.

193
00:20:52,886 --> 00:20:54,987
You know, there's only one way
to really beat that...

194
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:58,221
is if you have somebody else
from the inside open the door.

195
00:20:58,922 --> 00:21:00,389
I don't think I understand.

196
00:21:00,723 --> 00:21:03,524
You know what?
That's the trouble. Neither do I.

197
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:09,261
Well, if you ever want to know
any more about art, Lieutenant.

198
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,662
Oh. Thank you very much. Well, listen,
now that you mention it, tell me this.

199
00:21:14,029 --> 00:21:15,897
How does a thief get rid of
a painting like that?

200
00:21:15,997 --> 00:21:19,032
I mean, if they're that famous,
how can anybody sell it?

201
00:21:19,698 --> 00:21:24,067
Well, someone in
a foreign country maybe.

202
00:21:24,168 --> 00:21:27,402
Although, art thieves usually try to
make a deal of some kind with the owner,

203
00:21:27,502 --> 00:21:29,703
the gallery, the insurance company.

204
00:21:29,803 --> 00:21:33,305
You see, that's what I thought.
It's just like a kidnapping.

205
00:21:33,472 --> 00:21:35,373
In other words, what they want really
is the ransom.

206
00:21:35,473 --> 00:21:37,574
- Exactly.
- Right.

207
00:21:38,108 --> 00:21:40,042
So, you know in this case,

208
00:21:40,142 --> 00:21:43,111
somebody must be pretty scared
right now, don't you think?

209
00:21:43,211 --> 00:21:45,311
Might be anxious to settle quick.

210
00:21:45,811 --> 00:21:47,812
- Possibly.
- Sure.

211
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,148
You know, and since you're the first person
they might try to contact...

212
00:21:53,082 --> 00:21:56,384
I'll tell you what.
You give me your telephone number...

213
00:21:56,484 --> 00:22:00,352
and I'll put a tap on your phone
and we'll monitor all your calls.

214
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:02,921
You wouldn't mind that, would you?

215
00:22:04,054 --> 00:22:06,355
Of course not. Why should I?

216
00:22:11,925 --> 00:22:13,559
Gee, thank you very much.

217
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,626
- Good night.
- Good night.

218
00:23:21,993 --> 00:23:24,728
- Look out!
- Gee, I'm sorry.

219
00:23:24,828 --> 00:23:28,797
Oh, that's all right. I've been
bumping into things myself today.

220
00:23:28,897 --> 00:23:30,497
A little bit too much of
the grape last night.

221
00:23:30,598 --> 00:23:32,498
I didn't clear out of here till 3:00 a.m.

222
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:34,967
Mr. Kingston went home
a little earlier than that, I guess.

223
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:37,767
Well, he stayed long enough
to make every other gallery owner...

224
00:23:37,867 --> 00:23:40,035
on the street green with envy.

225
00:23:40,135 --> 00:23:42,237
Of course, you know,
Dale is usually in London or Paris.

226
00:23:42,403 --> 00:23:44,204
He doesn't fool around
with us peasants.

227
00:23:44,304 --> 00:23:48,006
I'll tell you what I really wanna know...
what time he got here.

228
00:23:48,707 --> 00:23:51,641
Yes. I know, I know.
Uh, Sam is right through there.

229
00:23:51,741 --> 00:23:54,009
I called the parking boy.
Be over in a minute.

230
00:23:54,109 --> 00:23:57,078
Sam, this is the policeman
who phoned.

231
00:23:57,277 --> 00:24:00,546
- Is it all right?
- Uh, bring him in.

232
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,514
They interrupted Rembrandt,
why shouldn't they interrupt me?

233
00:24:06,449 --> 00:24:07,949
Yeah, what is it?

234
00:24:08,617 --> 00:24:12,018
- If I'm interrupting something...
- No, you're not interrupting anything.

235
00:24:12,218 --> 00:24:15,419
Uh, forgive the mood,
but, uh, you caught me in a bad day.

236
00:24:15,686 --> 00:24:18,555
- This here is Chris.
- Oh, hi.

237
00:24:18,655 --> 00:24:22,123
- Hello. Are you an artist?
- No.

238
00:24:22,323 --> 00:24:25,358
- I can come back another time. I think I'm...
- Go ahead and interrupt.

239
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:27,592
- I'm here under duress.
- Thanks a lot.

240
00:24:27,692 --> 00:24:31,628
- Stop moving! I'm trying to paint you.
- Well, paint.

241
00:24:31,728 --> 00:24:34,062
Well, actually, it's very routine.
It's not that important. I think...

242
00:24:34,162 --> 00:24:37,430
Well, me and champagne
are not routine.

243
00:24:38,298 --> 00:24:40,566
And if you're interested in
finding out about Mr. Kingston,

244
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:42,934
what time he got here I don't know.

245
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:47,202
Uh, there was something about
his watch, but I'm not sure.

246
00:24:48,136 --> 00:24:49,937
Might help if you try to remember.

247
00:24:52,372 --> 00:24:54,439
Oh, yeah. Well...

248
00:24:55,107 --> 00:24:59,075
Uh, there was something wrong
with his watch.

249
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:04,077
Yeah, that's it, and, uh,
and he asked me what time it was.

250
00:25:04,745 --> 00:25:06,979
- That's it.
- That's it. I see.

251
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:09,947
- Well, thanks. Sorry to bother you.
- No bother.

252
00:25:10,047 --> 00:25:12,115
- Right.
- I'm in my commercial phase right now.

253
00:25:12,215 --> 00:25:15,050
Yeah. Sam's just mad at
the whole world that's all.

254
00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:18,418
That's because I made him
put her in his pretty pink cactus.

255
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:20,519
Can you imagine? He thinks
the artist should decide what the...

256
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:23,153
Mitilda, are you looking for me?

257
00:25:23,987 --> 00:25:24,821
Fine.

258
00:25:25,421 --> 00:25:28,690
Well, listen, I'll let you
finish your work. Excuse me.

259
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:32,058
- Do come back soon.
- Stop moving!

260
00:25:32,358 --> 00:25:33,792
All right.

261
00:25:38,595 --> 00:25:42,764
Hey, Joe, didn't the other boys tell me
you parked Kingston's car last night?

262
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,898
Sure, I remember.
The guy who gave me two bucks.

263
00:25:45,331 --> 00:25:48,066
Two bucks?
Just for parking a car?

264
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,035
No. He lost a cuff link.
I helped him search the whole car for it,

265
00:25:52,235 --> 00:25:53,268
trunk and everything.

266
00:25:53,368 --> 00:25:55,770
- Did you find it?
- No. Why?

267
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:58,805
Well, you know, most people's trunks,
they're kind of messy to look into.

268
00:25:59,138 --> 00:26:03,273
His wasn't. Nothing but a spare tire
and a topcoat. Nothing else in the whole car.

269
00:26:03,373 --> 00:26:04,808
What time was that?
Would you know?

270
00:26:05,541 --> 00:26:07,509
Oh, sure, 'cause he asked me.

271
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:10,077
Something was wrong with
his watch, I guess.

272
00:26:10,811 --> 00:26:12,445
It was five minutes to 11:00, sir.

273
00:26:12,812 --> 00:26:16,080
Mmm. Thanks. All right, that's it.

274
00:26:17,814 --> 00:26:21,749
Now, uh, what is this all about?
Because, like, uh,

275
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:24,618
Dale's uncle was murdered
sometime last night, right?

276
00:26:24,951 --> 00:26:27,352
Oh, no. Oh, no...

277
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:30,654
When I think what this
is gonna do to the art world.

278
00:26:30,754 --> 00:26:35,790
Can you imagine an art critic inheriting
that gorgeous collection? I do.

279
00:26:36,657 --> 00:26:39,325
Hey. Hey, would you look at that.

280
00:26:39,925 --> 00:26:41,526
A blue horse?

281
00:26:44,995 --> 00:26:50,564
<i>Painting the ladies and gentlemen
of the Spanish court with a savage brush.</i>

282
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:54,499
<i>Relentlessly, unremittingly
showing them in every detail,</i>

283
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:56,634
<i>down to the tiniest wart.</i>

284
00:26:56,934 --> 00:27:00,169
<i>But, when you take the "W"
off of wart,</i>

285
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:05,738
<i>you are still left with "art,"
and Goya was the penultimate artist.</i>

286
00:27:05,838 --> 00:27:10,107
<i>We will continue our discussion
of this fascinating artist tomorrow.</i>

287
00:27:10,207 --> 00:27:11,908
<i>Copies of today's lecture...</i>

288
00:27:12,008 --> 00:27:15,543
<i>may be obtained for a nominal fee
by writing to this station.</i>

289
00:27:15,643 --> 00:27:19,044
<i>This is Dale Kingston.
Good afternoon.</i>

290
00:27:19,144 --> 00:27:21,412
<i>Be with us again tomorrow
when Channel 16...</i>

291
00:27:21,512 --> 00:27:24,648
<i>brings you
Dale Kingston's World of Art.</i>

292
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:49,360
Studio 2. Yeah, we just broke.
I'll call him.

293
00:27:50,027 --> 00:27:52,261
- Telephone call, Mr. Kingston.
- Thank you, Phil.

294
00:27:52,362 --> 00:27:55,963
Phil, listen. While I've got you,
can we manage to get... Is that on?

295
00:27:56,063 --> 00:28:00,833
Phil, can't you cut that camera off me
the minute I finish talking, please?

296
00:28:00,933 --> 00:28:03,934
I'm always left with egg on my face.
Thank you.

297
00:28:05,868 --> 00:28:09,403
- Yes.
- Dale, I finally got you.

298
00:28:09,536 --> 00:28:11,337
I remembered you'd be doing your show.

299
00:28:11,437 --> 00:28:14,673
What are you doing calling?
I told you not to call for a whole week.

300
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:16,640
I know, but I was worried.

301
00:28:16,741 --> 00:28:22,310
That's just free-floating anxiety, dear.
Now, relax. Everything's going just...

302
00:28:24,111 --> 00:28:28,113
I'm terribly sorry.
No, I simply don't have time.

303
00:28:30,314 --> 00:28:31,547
Well, Lieutenant.

304
00:28:31,647 --> 00:28:33,949
Gee, I wish you wouldn't hang up
like that, Mr. Kingston.

305
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:35,516
I mean, somebody you don't know
tries to call...

306
00:28:35,616 --> 00:28:40,552
Lieutenant, I get a dozen calls a day
just like that from would-be artists,

307
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:42,186
from ladies who want to evaluate...

308
00:28:42,286 --> 00:28:44,855
some stupid, little print their maiden aunts
left them in their attic.

309
00:28:44,954 --> 00:28:47,722
- If I paid attention to every one of 'em...
- You mean, that was a woman?

310
00:28:47,822 --> 00:28:51,357
Yes, and it wasn't any ransom call
if that's what you're thinking.

311
00:28:51,457 --> 00:28:56,560
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a museum
to go to, then a dinner, then a lecture.

312
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,561
Well, I was hoping that
we could have a little time to talk.

313
00:28:59,661 --> 00:29:01,863
We can get together later if you'd like.

314
00:29:03,463 --> 00:29:06,332
No, I've gotta take my makeup off anyway.

315
00:29:06,565 --> 00:29:09,533
- May as well do it now. Follow me.
- Fine. Thank you very much.

316
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,802
- Uh, so this is a television studio, huh?
- Yes.

317
00:29:13,902 --> 00:29:16,170
- Quite a place.
- Well, it's a barn, really.

318
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,971
I'm sure it's not as glamorous
as you'd thought it'd be.

319
00:29:18,071 --> 00:29:19,571
That's right. It isn't.

320
00:29:19,671 --> 00:29:23,173
But things aren't really
what they seem to be, are they?

321
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,975
My, how observant you are.

322
00:29:26,442 --> 00:29:28,143
Hildy, my beauty,

323
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:30,511
how fast do you think
we can get this paint off me?

324
00:29:30,611 --> 00:29:32,578
I'll use high-speed turpentine.

325
00:29:33,111 --> 00:29:34,312
Well, anyway, uh,

326
00:29:34,413 --> 00:29:37,547
I'm sorry to bother you here,
but you haven't been home much.

327
00:29:37,814 --> 00:29:39,014
Now that's too bad in a way.

328
00:29:39,114 --> 00:29:41,783
That tap on your phone,
it's not helping us any.

329
00:29:41,883 --> 00:29:44,418
I'm not
your only possibility, Lieutenant.

330
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:47,485
I don't know whether you know this,
but my uncle was married once.

331
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:51,087
In fact, his ex-wife still lists herself
in the phone book under her married name.

332
00:29:51,187 --> 00:29:55,356
So, you see, whoever took those paintings
could very well be trying to contact her.

333
00:29:55,456 --> 00:29:57,023
You know, somebody mentioned that.

334
00:29:57,123 --> 00:30:00,559
So I saw Mrs. Matthews this morning.
We're watching her phone too.

335
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:02,794
Oh, that must have been
some interview.

336
00:30:03,126 --> 00:30:06,228
- Aunt Edna can be a bit trying.
- I thought she was kind of nice.

337
00:30:06,328 --> 00:30:09,029
Oh, she's very nice, but, uh, trying.

338
00:30:09,363 --> 00:30:14,132
Well, you said you had
some questions you wanted to ask me?

339
00:30:14,232 --> 00:30:16,767
Yeah. Nothing important,
just a few details.

340
00:30:16,866 --> 00:30:19,735
Like that backdoor thing.
That really bothers me.

341
00:30:19,835 --> 00:30:20,836
What about it?

342
00:30:20,935 --> 00:30:23,103
Um, does that coffee machine work?

343
00:30:23,203 --> 00:30:25,438
Yes, of course it does.
What about it?

344
00:30:25,738 --> 00:30:27,105
Well, you know, the lab says that...

345
00:30:27,205 --> 00:30:30,774
there was just no way for that lock
to be forced from the outside.

346
00:30:30,873 --> 00:30:33,308
Thank you, Hildy. So?

347
00:30:33,508 --> 00:30:35,776
- Would you like a coffee?
- No, thanks.

348
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:38,178
Well, how did anyone get in?

349
00:30:39,178 --> 00:30:40,512
You see, Evans is positive that...

350
00:30:40,612 --> 00:30:43,580
all the doors were locked
when he left the house earlier.

351
00:30:44,347 --> 00:30:48,550
And I don't see your uncle
letting anyone in, unless he knew 'em.

352
00:30:52,318 --> 00:30:55,786
Did you come all this way
just to tell me that?

353
00:30:56,654 --> 00:31:01,189
Well, I thought you'd be interested.
Like, I did clear up one routine thing.

354
00:31:01,456 --> 00:31:04,924
You know that gallery you went to?
Checked out. Hope you don't mind.

355
00:31:05,024 --> 00:31:07,559
Well, that's your job. And?

356
00:31:07,826 --> 00:31:10,927
The parking lot boy, he remembered
when you got there all right.

357
00:31:11,027 --> 00:31:15,029
So that if Mr. Matthews was killed at 11:00,
then you sure didn't do it.

358
00:31:16,464 --> 00:31:19,164
Now isn't that a shame, Lieutenant?

359
00:31:19,264 --> 00:31:23,033
And here I am your best
and most obvious suspect too.

360
00:31:23,867 --> 00:31:28,203
Aw, don't say things like that.
Really, you've got me all wrong.

361
00:31:28,436 --> 00:31:31,938
It's just that I get bugged by
those little things.

362
00:31:32,605 --> 00:31:33,672
Like, no connection.

363
00:31:33,772 --> 00:31:38,475
But why would a person look in
the trunk of a car for a missing cuff link?

364
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:41,175
'Cause I happened to toss
my topcoat in there...

365
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:43,376
in order to
keep it from getting stolen.

366
00:31:43,477 --> 00:31:45,311
Then I noticed that the link was missing.

367
00:31:46,278 --> 00:31:47,779
Of course.

368
00:31:47,879 --> 00:31:50,380
See, I could've guessed that.

369
00:31:50,481 --> 00:31:54,382
A little while later I found the link
caught in the lining of my sleeve.

370
00:31:54,483 --> 00:31:56,183
I'm gonna tell you somethin'.

371
00:31:56,317 --> 00:31:59,318
Do you know that there is
a reasonable explanation for everything...

372
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:01,118
if you just put your mind to it?

373
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,221
Of course, sometimes these things,
they pop up.

374
00:32:04,521 --> 00:32:08,223
Like with alibis.
Do you know in most cases,

375
00:32:08,523 --> 00:32:10,491
people, they don't remember
what time it is.

376
00:32:10,591 --> 00:32:13,592
They forget all that.
Like the artist fella.

377
00:32:13,692 --> 00:32:15,860
He's all mixed up about the time.

378
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:20,062
And Mrs. Matthews, she don't even remember
what time she went to bed last night.

379
00:32:20,462 --> 00:32:22,929
Well, being sober
might help, I suppose.

380
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:27,832
Now, with you, Mr. Kingston,
it's just the opposite. Very unusual.

381
00:32:28,533 --> 00:32:32,734
With you, we know exactly
where you were and when.

382
00:32:33,068 --> 00:32:37,103
Not only that,
we know your whole car was empty.

383
00:32:38,037 --> 00:32:39,738
Yes. Isn't that nice?

384
00:32:42,073 --> 00:32:43,540
Well, if you'll excuse me.

385
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,275
Mm. Oh, listen, by the way,
can I show you something?

386
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:48,376
It's only gonna take a second.

387
00:32:48,476 --> 00:32:50,544
Uh, you can rent paintings,
did you know that?

388
00:32:50,644 --> 00:32:51,410
Yes, I know.

389
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,612
And my father-in-law,
he loves Western movies,

390
00:32:53,712 --> 00:32:56,680
so I figured, a few bucks,
you can't get hurt.

391
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:00,349
Uh, what do you think?

392
00:33:00,715 --> 00:33:01,616
Any good?

393
00:33:01,716 --> 00:33:04,783
For wallpaper in a child's room,
absolutely perfect.

394
00:33:04,884 --> 00:33:09,119
In fact, it looks like it might've been
done by an untalented 12-year-old.

395
00:33:09,686 --> 00:33:12,821
You know, I was kind of afraid
you were going to say something like that.

396
00:33:13,355 --> 00:33:15,089
But you know, then I say,

397
00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:19,224
why would you bother to go there
last night if this guy's stuff is so bad?

398
00:33:19,324 --> 00:33:22,226
I mean, this was painted by the artist
whose exhibit you were covering.

399
00:33:22,326 --> 00:33:26,262
Lieutenant Columbo, unlike my uncle,
I am not independently wealthy.

400
00:33:26,362 --> 00:33:30,030
I have to work for a living.
Magazines pay me to review art.

401
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,298
Unfortunately, they pay me best...

402
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:35,633
when I write hostile reviews
about hacks like Sam Franklin.

403
00:33:35,733 --> 00:33:37,934
Oh. Well, I'll tell ya,

404
00:33:38,034 --> 00:33:40,335
I'd sure hate to see
his review when you write it.

405
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,537
- Mmm.
- Oh, listen. One more thing.

406
00:33:42,637 --> 00:33:47,105
It just... It'll just take a second.
I stopped by your apartment a few times.

407
00:33:47,205 --> 00:33:49,172
Why, do you want to search my place?

408
00:33:49,273 --> 00:33:51,340
No. Just to ask you something
about art.

409
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,409
You said you had some books
and things there that I could see.

410
00:33:54,509 --> 00:33:56,776
You may look at anything you wish.

411
00:33:56,876 --> 00:34:00,512
You can snoop in all of my closets.
You can peek under the beds.

412
00:34:00,612 --> 00:34:02,413
You won't find any stolen paintings.

413
00:34:02,513 --> 00:34:03,914
Oh, really, I've never said
anything about...

414
00:34:04,014 --> 00:34:05,548
Here. Would you like the key
to my apartment?

415
00:34:05,648 --> 00:34:08,316
You may simply leave it under the mat
when you leave.

416
00:34:08,416 --> 00:34:11,317
- No, really. I...
- No, no. Go ahead. I insist.

417
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:14,519
See what I live like.
Find out what kind of human being I am.

418
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:16,587
Learn everything you can about me.

419
00:34:16,686 --> 00:34:19,388
Well, I... I mean, I admit
it would be more convenient.

420
00:34:19,488 --> 00:34:22,123
But, uh, thank you
very much, Mr. Kingston.

421
00:34:22,223 --> 00:34:24,257
Uh, I'm sorry I took up
so much of your time.

422
00:34:24,357 --> 00:34:27,725
I might drop by and borrow a few books
or something like that.

423
00:34:32,827 --> 00:34:33,495
See ya.

424
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,439
Dale!

425
00:34:57,574 --> 00:34:58,840
You all right?

426
00:34:58,941 --> 00:35:01,042
Yeah. I'm sorry I called you.

427
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:03,643
Well, I just couldn't wait.
I had to know what was happening.

428
00:35:03,743 --> 00:35:08,279
Nothing's happening. No problems at all.
Everything's just perfect.

429
00:35:08,645 --> 00:35:11,147
Now, the gun and the paintings,

430
00:35:12,248 --> 00:35:13,348
they're still in your car, right?

431
00:35:13,448 --> 00:35:15,883
Oh, yeah. I did exactly what you told me.
I haven't touched a thing.

432
00:35:15,983 --> 00:35:20,018
Good. You'll feel a lot better
once you get those off your hands.

433
00:35:25,254 --> 00:35:26,988
Hold that open for me.

434
00:35:40,628 --> 00:35:42,996
- Dale!
- What's the matter?

435
00:35:43,129 --> 00:35:46,898
Well-Well, I never saw them before.
They're beautiful.

436
00:35:51,267 --> 00:35:53,168
Now why can't I paint like that?

437
00:35:53,268 --> 00:35:55,970
Patience, my dear. Patience.

438
00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:00,439
I told you you had talent
when you first came to see me, remember?

439
00:36:02,173 --> 00:36:05,474
Takes time to get
what you really want.

440
00:36:15,245 --> 00:36:18,281
Sometimes I think my talent
isn't what you like best about me.

441
00:36:18,381 --> 00:36:21,082
Well, it's a combination
of things, Myla.

442
00:36:23,216 --> 00:36:27,652
Dale, you do
care for me, don't you?

443
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,620
After the risks
you've taken for me?

444
00:36:31,687 --> 00:36:33,822
Of course I do.

445
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:43,727
Now let's get out of here.

446
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,461
Is there anything else
you want me to do?

447
00:36:45,561 --> 00:36:47,762
Not a thing.
I'll be in touch with you by phone.

448
00:36:50,297 --> 00:36:51,497
When will I see you again?

449
00:36:51,897 --> 00:36:53,898
Very shortly, my love.

450
00:36:57,767 --> 00:36:58,434
When will I...

451
00:38:03,733 --> 00:38:05,067
Columbo.

452
00:38:10,469 --> 00:38:11,637
Mr. Kingston.

453
00:38:11,871 --> 00:38:13,471
What are you doing here
at this hour of the night?

454
00:38:14,738 --> 00:38:15,506
Is it night?

455
00:38:16,306 --> 00:38:17,306
Yes, it is.

456
00:38:20,242 --> 00:38:23,276
Gee, I...
I must've fallen asleep here.

457
00:38:23,376 --> 00:38:26,511
I came in to read these book...
Did you get your key?

458
00:38:26,811 --> 00:38:30,013
I left a key under the mat.
Oh, good. You got it.

459
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,714
Gee. Yes, I...

460
00:38:33,415 --> 00:38:36,350
I was readin' these articles.
I must've fallen...

461
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:40,018
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.
I just fell asleep here.

462
00:38:40,118 --> 00:38:42,719
Look, it's quite late, Lieutenant.
If you don't mind,

463
00:38:42,819 --> 00:38:45,587
I've just had a tiresome evening
at a lecture,

464
00:38:45,688 --> 00:38:49,289
after which I spent some time with some
even more tiresome people from the museum.

465
00:38:49,389 --> 00:38:51,057
- So if you'll excuse me.
- Oh, of course.

466
00:38:51,157 --> 00:38:53,625
I'll get out of your hair.
I'm-I'm awfully sorry about this.

467
00:38:53,725 --> 00:38:55,893
Did you pick up something interesting?

468
00:38:56,993 --> 00:38:59,194
Uh, no, just some, um,

469
00:38:59,494 --> 00:39:02,063
insipid watercolors that
these people want me to evaluate.

470
00:39:02,163 --> 00:39:03,296
- Watercolors?
- Yes.

471
00:39:03,396 --> 00:39:07,298
I was just looking at watercolors.
Matisse? Wonderful.

472
00:39:07,398 --> 00:39:09,533
I'd love to hear
what you had to say about him.

473
00:39:09,633 --> 00:39:12,667
- Could we take just a moment...
- No... Lieutenant, please!

474
00:39:13,401 --> 00:39:15,135
- If you don't mind, I...
- Oh.

475
00:39:15,235 --> 00:39:17,704
It's quite late. I'm-I'm quite exhausted.
Some other time, please.

476
00:39:17,804 --> 00:39:20,205
Oh, I'm sorry. Of course.
I should've realized.

477
00:39:20,305 --> 00:39:23,206
- I just got so caught up in this art thing...
- My phone. My phone, Lieutenant.

478
00:39:23,306 --> 00:39:25,474
- Your phone?
- My phone.

479
00:39:25,641 --> 00:39:29,409
It, uh, just might be
people about the ransom.

480
00:39:29,843 --> 00:39:31,777
Oh. By all means.

481
00:39:34,578 --> 00:39:37,513
Hello? Yes.

482
00:39:38,747 --> 00:39:40,948
Yes, he is. Just a moment.
It's for you.

483
00:39:42,249 --> 00:39:44,717
I told 'em at the office
that I might stop by.

484
00:39:44,817 --> 00:39:46,651
- Thank you very much.
- It's all right.

485
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:50,153
Yeah? What?

486
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,687
Well, where was it?

487
00:39:54,421 --> 00:39:57,623
Yes, I understand,
but why are you calling me for?

488
00:39:58,423 --> 00:40:01,459
Oh. Okay, I'll be right down.

489
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:02,659
Mmm.

490
00:40:04,993 --> 00:40:07,095
Listen, I'm sorry. I gotta run.

491
00:40:07,395 --> 00:40:09,162
Gee, it's always somethin'.

492
00:40:10,329 --> 00:40:13,631
This highway patrolman,
he found a girl in a car.

493
00:40:13,832 --> 00:40:16,300
Ran over a cliff to Malibu Canyon.

494
00:40:16,399 --> 00:40:17,467
Dead.

495
00:40:19,468 --> 00:40:22,535
- You get all sorts of cases, don't you?
- Yeah, listen.

496
00:40:22,702 --> 00:40:24,770
They won't let me live.
What are you gonna do?

497
00:40:25,537 --> 00:40:28,438
Uh, I'm sorry.
I-I didn't mean to fall asleep here.

498
00:40:28,538 --> 00:40:30,573
- I hope I didn't bother you too much.
- It's all right.

499
00:40:30,673 --> 00:40:31,974
Get some rest.

500
00:41:01,622 --> 00:41:02,989
Mrs. Matthews?

501
00:41:03,289 --> 00:41:05,891
- Oh, Lieutenant Columbo!
- How are ya?

502
00:41:05,991 --> 00:41:06,791
I'm fine.

503
00:41:06,891 --> 00:41:07,692
Good. Listen,

504
00:41:07,792 --> 00:41:10,559
Mr. Kingston and the attorney
said it was all right if I dropped by.

505
00:41:10,659 --> 00:41:14,129
- I hope you don't mind.
- Oh, no! Of course not.

506
00:41:14,229 --> 00:41:17,330
The more, the merrier. But it...

507
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:21,899
it does seem such a shame
to hear poor Rudy this way.

508
00:41:21,999 --> 00:41:26,201
All those "whereases."
It won't sound like him at all.

509
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,702
You know, lawyers
always have a way of makin'...

510
00:41:27,802 --> 00:41:29,636
It's like an old movie...

511
00:41:29,736 --> 00:41:32,971
with all the barristers and the butlers
and the discarded wives...

512
00:41:33,071 --> 00:41:37,140
all gathering together
in the library to hear the will read.

513
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,974
Oh! Perhaps we'd better go.

514
00:41:39,074 --> 00:41:41,809
It's never bothered me
till just about two months ago.

515
00:41:41,909 --> 00:41:42,976
Really? You know, I have a friend...

516
00:41:43,076 --> 00:41:46,277
He wasn't always
a very nice man, you know.

517
00:41:46,377 --> 00:41:48,212
Just business, business, business.

518
00:41:48,311 --> 00:41:50,746
And then collecting. Oh!

519
00:41:50,846 --> 00:41:53,281
Collecting like some old pack rat.

520
00:41:53,381 --> 00:41:57,150
But how anyone
could want to kill Rudy, I...

521
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:00,384
- Oh, hello, Dale.
- Edna, darling.

522
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,186
- Hello, Lieutenant.
- Mr. Kingston.

523
00:42:02,285 --> 00:42:04,987
What have you got there this time,
a pink rabbit?

524
00:42:05,087 --> 00:42:07,855
Oh, this? No, no, not really. But it is
something that I wanted to show you.

525
00:42:07,955 --> 00:42:10,056
- Oh, show me too.
- Edna, my dear.

526
00:42:10,157 --> 00:42:11,724
- Frank.
- Dale.

527
00:42:11,824 --> 00:42:14,792
And Lt. Columbo. We can begin now.

528
00:42:14,892 --> 00:42:16,692
Mr. Evans and his wife are here already.

529
00:42:16,793 --> 00:42:18,360
But Lieutenant was just going
to show us...

530
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,461
Never mind. He'll show me.

531
00:42:19,561 --> 00:42:21,796
We'll join you in a little while.
Thank you, Frank.

532
00:42:21,896 --> 00:42:24,496
I hope you're feeling better, Edna.

533
00:42:27,131 --> 00:42:28,298
What do you think?

534
00:42:32,267 --> 00:42:33,401
It's frightful.

535
00:42:33,501 --> 00:42:35,636
That's what I figured.
But you know what?

536
00:42:35,736 --> 00:42:39,538
I thought maybe you just might
recognize the style or the signature.

537
00:42:41,939 --> 00:42:43,840
No. Who on earth is Tracy?

538
00:42:44,174 --> 00:42:48,109
Well, do you remember the other night
when I had to leave your place in a hurry?

539
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:51,677
Oh, yes, that highway patrol thing.
Some kind of an accident, wasn't it?

540
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:54,211
That's what it looked like.
But you see, I told...

541
00:42:54,311 --> 00:42:57,880
I said whenever a case comes up that has
anything to do with art or painting,

542
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:58,647
you call me.

543
00:42:58,747 --> 00:43:00,881
Now, wait a minute.
You mean it wasn't an accident?

544
00:43:01,248 --> 00:43:04,783
Oh, yeah, it's an accident.
I mean, that's what it's listed as.

545
00:43:04,917 --> 00:43:08,652
But, anyway, you see, the dead girl,
she was some kind of an art student.

546
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:12,121
And I thought, well, who knows,
maybe you knew something about her.

547
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,788
Tracy O'Connor?

548
00:43:16,889 --> 00:43:22,192
Lieutenant, there must be over 100,000
art students in Southern California.

549
00:43:22,959 --> 00:43:23,693
Well, you see,

550
00:43:23,793 --> 00:43:27,128
I remember seein' one of those
lecture schedules in your apartment.

551
00:43:27,328 --> 00:43:28,295
And a couple of months ago,

552
00:43:28,395 --> 00:43:31,564
you gave several lectures
in the school where this girl was enrolled.

553
00:43:32,031 --> 00:43:35,132
- This is what she looks like.
- Be realistic, Lieutenant.

554
00:43:35,232 --> 00:43:38,533
You think I can remember everyone who
ever sat in on one of my lectures?

555
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:41,535
I've never seen that girl before
in my life.

556
00:43:41,635 --> 00:43:43,837
Why don't you stop wasting
everybody's time?

557
00:43:45,003 --> 00:43:46,604
These are all minor details.

558
00:43:46,704 --> 00:43:49,339
- Sit down, Dale, won't you?
- Thank you, Frank.

559
00:43:50,139 --> 00:43:54,842
"For their devoted service to me...
for the past 10 y..."

560
00:43:55,342 --> 00:43:58,343
Uh, Lieutenant, why don't you
make yourself comfortable.

561
00:43:58,543 --> 00:44:03,079
We've uh, skimmed over the preliminaries.
We're now down to the salient points.

562
00:44:03,179 --> 00:44:04,980
- Proceed as you wish, Counselor.
- Mmm.

563
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:08,381
"For their devoted service to me
for the past 10 years,

564
00:44:08,481 --> 00:44:11,150
I bequeath to Mr. and Mrs. Evans jointly...

565
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:14,284
an annual payment of $2,000...

566
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:16,853
to be paid on the first day
of each and every year...

567
00:44:17,286 --> 00:44:20,088
in which either one of them
is still surviving."

568
00:44:20,187 --> 00:44:21,722
Such a kind man.

569
00:44:22,388 --> 00:44:23,690
"Finally, to, uh...

570
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:27,692
to my primary heir of all previous wills,
to my nephew Dale Kingston,

571
00:44:27,925 --> 00:44:31,260
whom I once supported through college
and who has had the full freedom...

572
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:34,995
of my home and possessions
ever since without thought of recompense,

573
00:44:35,596 --> 00:44:39,097
I bequeath the full bulk and remainder
of my estate...

574
00:44:39,331 --> 00:44:41,832
with this one single exception:

575
00:44:42,699 --> 00:44:48,134
To Edna Matthews, the wife whom I mistakenly
divorced 15 years ago,

576
00:44:48,401 --> 00:44:51,036
I bequeath
my entire art collection,

577
00:44:53,071 --> 00:44:57,073
including all of those paintings listed
in the so-called Matthews Collection."

578
00:44:57,173 --> 00:45:00,774
- Mr. Kingston! Oh, no!
- If you please.

579
00:45:01,041 --> 00:45:04,343
This will is properly signed and
witnessed as of the 10th of last month.

580
00:45:04,476 --> 00:45:06,777
Here. I think you all
should take a look at these.

581
00:45:08,211 --> 00:45:12,047
Dale, I'm sorry.
I-I'm really sorry.

582
00:45:12,146 --> 00:45:14,748
Oh, no.
Don't be silly, Aunt Edna.

583
00:45:14,848 --> 00:45:16,849
All it means is that I'll now
be able to criticize...

584
00:45:16,949 --> 00:45:19,517
your collection
like I used to criticize his.

585
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:22,151
- Thank you, Frank.
- Mm-hmm.

586
00:45:23,319 --> 00:45:24,486
Lieutenant.

587
00:45:25,587 --> 00:45:28,688
Mrs. Matthews, I hope...
This is just such a surprise.

588
00:45:28,788 --> 00:45:30,689
We are... I'm happy for you.

589
00:45:30,789 --> 00:45:33,424
I know you'll be pleased with it.
I'm sure you will.

590
00:45:33,524 --> 00:45:36,058
- I wasn't prepared for that.
- Nope. Really is a shock.

591
00:45:36,158 --> 00:45:40,094
File those, would you, please?
I tried to talk Rudy out of it, naturally.

592
00:45:41,795 --> 00:45:44,463
He always intended to leave
that collection to Dale.

593
00:45:44,696 --> 00:45:46,297
Then, give it to her.

594
00:45:47,765 --> 00:45:49,900
That's why I thought
you'd like to be here.

595
00:45:50,366 --> 00:45:53,001
- Legally, I couldn't say anything until...
- Oh, sure. I understand that.

596
00:45:53,101 --> 00:45:56,836
It's just that that was a new will?
Only last month?

597
00:45:56,936 --> 00:45:59,304
That's correct.
He wrote most of it himself.

598
00:45:59,571 --> 00:46:02,372
Oh, he promised to let me
draw up something more detailed...

599
00:46:02,472 --> 00:46:04,339
and complete later on, but...

600
00:46:04,439 --> 00:46:06,440
Boy, I can't figure it. I...

601
00:46:07,108 --> 00:46:09,509
You'd think the nephew
would get the paintings.

602
00:46:09,609 --> 00:46:11,343
I agree. I agree.

603
00:46:11,911 --> 00:46:14,411
Mr. Matthews had
disagreements with Dale,

604
00:46:14,511 --> 00:46:18,146
but an art collection like that
is big business.

605
00:46:18,914 --> 00:46:22,749
To manage that requires
specialized skill, taste.

606
00:46:23,883 --> 00:46:29,920
Why he'd simply leave the whole thing
to a poor, unstable creature like Ed...

607
00:46:31,253 --> 00:46:33,254
Those comments are hardly
professional of me, are they?

608
00:46:33,321 --> 00:46:34,688
One thing, though.

609
00:46:35,055 --> 00:46:38,390
If Mr. Kingston doesn't get the collection,
he at least gets the rest of the estate.

610
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:40,090
It's meaningless.

611
00:46:40,491 --> 00:46:44,960
He rented that big house.
Rudy disposed of all his business interests.

612
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,228
There really isn't any
remaining estate to speak of.

613
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:54,131
Well, listen, uh,
thanks for lettin' me come down.

614
00:46:54,231 --> 00:46:57,633
- I gotta get back to work.
- Uh, Lieutenant?

615
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,401
- Your painting.
- Oh, thank you very much.

616
00:47:00,501 --> 00:47:03,169
Uh, Lieutenant? My lighter.

617
00:47:04,002 --> 00:47:04,970
Oh.

618
00:47:06,337 --> 00:47:07,905
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

619
00:47:12,907 --> 00:47:14,841
Miss Henderson,
I'll make my calls now, please.

620
00:47:19,444 --> 00:47:21,078
Looking for me, Lieutenant?

621
00:47:22,312 --> 00:47:26,580
Oh. Yeah, I thought I'd kind of catch you
out in the parking lot.

622
00:47:26,681 --> 00:47:30,916
Expect you'd find me there kicking my tires
in frustration, I suppose?

623
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:33,584
Well, I thought there'd be
the normal amount of disappointment.

624
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:36,419
You are so transparent, Columbo.

625
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:39,721
You had this thing all figured out
right from the start, haven't you?

626
00:47:39,921 --> 00:47:44,323
Dale Kingston hired someone
to fake the theft and kill his uncle.

627
00:47:44,656 --> 00:47:47,358
Maybe even some
poor little art student, perhaps.

628
00:47:47,458 --> 00:47:48,658
Mr. Kingston, I never said that.

629
00:47:48,758 --> 00:47:52,460
And even though I had
an airtight alibi by total accident,

630
00:47:52,727 --> 00:47:55,329
at the time of my uncle's murder,
that still didn't stop you, did it?

631
00:47:55,429 --> 00:47:56,395
Mr. Kingston, really, I...

632
00:47:56,495 --> 00:47:57,430
Well, at this point,

633
00:47:57,530 --> 00:48:01,598
I'm sure that even a compulsively
suspicious bureaucrat like you...

634
00:48:01,899 --> 00:48:04,399
must have his doubts about my guilt.

635
00:48:04,766 --> 00:48:06,767
Because you heard it up there,
Mr. Columbo.

636
00:48:07,068 --> 00:48:11,670
You heard it in plain English.
I do not inherit.

637
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:14,638
- Edna does.
- That's very true, Mr. Kingston.

638
00:48:14,738 --> 00:48:18,473
- That's very true, except...
- Except what?

639
00:48:19,374 --> 00:48:23,643
Well, maybe you didn't know that
your uncle changed his will.

640
00:48:24,176 --> 00:48:26,944
Oh, I was hoping you'd say that,

641
00:48:27,978 --> 00:48:30,145
because, you see,
I've known for more than 10 days...

642
00:48:30,245 --> 00:48:33,681
that I couldn't possibly inherit
any part of that collection.

643
00:48:34,214 --> 00:48:37,016
But since you won't believe me,
maybe you'll believe my uncle.

644
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:41,452
Go on. I'm sure
somebody in your department...

645
00:48:41,552 --> 00:48:44,419
is capable of verifying
that signature.

646
00:48:45,454 --> 00:48:46,754
Go on, read it.

647
00:48:47,455 --> 00:48:50,055
He sent me that letter 10 days ago
telling me about the new will.

648
00:48:50,456 --> 00:48:52,090
Look at the postmark.

649
00:48:55,525 --> 00:48:58,593
- So you did know?
- Of course I knew.

650
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,663
Now, would you please do me a favor
and stop pestering me...

651
00:49:03,962 --> 00:49:07,431
and go on out and do what you
should've done in the first place, huh?

652
00:49:07,698 --> 00:49:09,632
Find the real killer!

653
00:49:29,709 --> 00:49:32,710
- Lieutenant, I'm not a busybody.
- I never said that.

654
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:34,111
Yeah, well,

655
00:49:34,211 --> 00:49:37,846
some landlords like to pry into the lives
of their tenants, but not me.

656
00:49:37,946 --> 00:49:39,913
My policy is live and let live.

657
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:43,516
Come on. What's bothering Walter?
He won't eat?

658
00:49:43,616 --> 00:49:45,050
Well, maybe he's not hungry.

659
00:49:45,217 --> 00:49:49,119
Listen, it's not that you're a busybody.
You live here and you see things.

660
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:51,320
I mean, how can you live here
and not see things?

661
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:52,687
Such as?

662
00:49:52,787 --> 00:49:55,821
Well, who goes out with who
and who's doing what. All those things.

663
00:49:55,921 --> 00:49:57,989
This girl, Tracy O'Connor,
who did she go out with?

664
00:49:58,089 --> 00:49:59,591
Come on. Tell me.
She dated, didn't she?

665
00:49:59,691 --> 00:50:01,525
Oh, of course she dated.

666
00:50:01,625 --> 00:50:04,126
Oh, you know, that was
a terrible shame about that accident.

667
00:50:04,226 --> 00:50:06,627
- That was a very talented girl.
- Very.

668
00:50:06,727 --> 00:50:09,095
Well, you oughta know. You took one of
her paintings the last time you were here.

669
00:50:09,195 --> 00:50:11,363
- She was a very gifted girl.
- You're darn right.

670
00:50:11,463 --> 00:50:14,231
- And it was a shame about the accident.
- Right.

671
00:50:14,331 --> 00:50:15,898
You know why I hated
to give up the painting?

672
00:50:16,165 --> 00:50:17,700
Well, why did you give it up?

673
00:50:17,799 --> 00:50:19,267
- I had to.
- What for?

674
00:50:19,434 --> 00:50:22,969
- Well, that was evidence.
- Evidence for what?

675
00:50:23,069 --> 00:50:26,404
Listen, I don't wanna get into that.
That's too complicated. Walter, come here.

676
00:50:26,704 --> 00:50:28,905
Come here, boy.
Don't-Don't-Don't-Don't do that!

677
00:50:29,005 --> 00:50:30,873
Walter doesn't like strangers.
He'll bite.

678
00:50:30,973 --> 00:50:34,408
- Will he? Oh.
- It was an accident, wasn't it?

679
00:50:34,508 --> 00:50:37,676
Listen, are you gonna tell me
about the men in her life or not?

680
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:42,311
All right, the men. Now, remember,

681
00:50:42,412 --> 00:50:44,746
I wasn't particularly trying
to find out about her,

682
00:50:44,846 --> 00:50:47,081
but I do remember one or two.

683
00:50:47,847 --> 00:50:51,983
There was an actor fella.
There were a couple of those beach types.

684
00:50:52,083 --> 00:50:54,484
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- And there was a kid that played...

685
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:56,886
- You want me to tell you the truth?
- Yeah.

686
00:50:56,986 --> 00:50:59,754
- I'm interested in one guy in particular.
- Who?

687
00:50:59,853 --> 00:51:03,122
Forty years old, well dressed,
distinguished.

688
00:51:03,789 --> 00:51:05,490
Wait a minute. Now, wait a minute.

689
00:51:05,756 --> 00:51:09,025
Come to think of it, there was one
older gentleman she was seeing.

690
00:51:09,125 --> 00:51:10,926
Really? Can you describe him?

691
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:13,628
Would a picture help?

692
00:51:13,894 --> 00:51:17,829
A picture? Are ya kidding?
You have a picture of this fella?

693
00:51:17,929 --> 00:51:19,830
Yeah, it's around here someplace
if I haven't thrown it away.

694
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:21,398
It's probably in my album.

695
00:51:21,498 --> 00:51:22,965
Where did you get a photograph of him?

696
00:51:23,066 --> 00:51:27,034
Well, I was taking some snapshots of my nephew
out at the pool.

697
00:51:27,134 --> 00:51:30,903
And Tracy and her friend were out there,
so I took one of them too.

698
00:51:31,003 --> 00:51:33,304
- I'm sure it's in one of these.
- You're a lifesaver.

699
00:51:33,404 --> 00:51:35,838
Well, let's see.

700
00:51:37,872 --> 00:51:41,475
Oh! Here was one. That's when my cousins
were out here from Milwaukee.

701
00:51:41,575 --> 00:51:44,676
We stopped at one of those roadside
stands, you know, for date malts.

702
00:51:44,776 --> 00:51:47,545
Oh, I got so sick, but they're awful good.
Have you ever had one?

703
00:51:47,645 --> 00:51:49,045
Think you'd like 'em.

704
00:51:49,845 --> 00:51:51,979
Oh, there's Cindy Lou.
That's my cousin's kid.

705
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,981
She's named for me. Look at her.
That's at Grauman's Chinese.

706
00:51:55,082 --> 00:51:58,616
She's trying to fit her feet into the...
you know, the things in the concrete.

707
00:51:58,716 --> 00:52:00,617
That's awful cute.
I made her that dress.

708
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:03,419
- Doesn't that look nice?
- Um...

709
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:05,620
- Can you see...
- Well, let's see, now.

710
00:52:05,719 --> 00:52:09,456
Oh! Here's a whole bunch of us that went
out to the family plot and had a picnic.

711
00:52:09,556 --> 00:52:12,290
We did some weeding and planting.
We had the best time.

712
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:15,292
We had more laughs... Look, isn't that cute?
That's my Uncle Henry there.

713
00:52:15,392 --> 00:52:17,193
- Oh.
- Now, wait a minute. We must...

714
00:52:17,293 --> 00:52:19,693
That's a nice one too. Look at that.
That was taken at the zoo.

715
00:52:19,793 --> 00:52:22,628
- Isn't that a good one of a lion?
- Wonderful. Do you have any idea...

716
00:52:22,728 --> 00:52:23,463
Now, wait a minute.

717
00:52:23,563 --> 00:52:27,231
Oh-oh, here it is. Here you go.
There. Well, there he is.

718
00:52:30,065 --> 00:52:32,400
That's the one. Any help?

719
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,868
No kidding?

720
00:52:34,968 --> 00:52:37,470
- That's not him.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

721
00:52:39,736 --> 00:52:41,838
You guys still guarding this place?

722
00:52:41,938 --> 00:52:44,272
Just me. I keep the tourists away.

723
00:52:44,873 --> 00:52:47,575
Say, uh, you know anything
about aphids?

724
00:52:48,508 --> 00:52:51,310
- Aphids?
- Yeah, they're destroying my roses.

725
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:54,277
My wife doesn't want me
to use any pesticides.

726
00:52:55,045 --> 00:52:58,847
Hard spray from your garden hose
around 4:00 or 5:00 p.m.

727
00:52:59,013 --> 00:53:01,747
Uh, the sun's still hot enough
to dry,

728
00:53:02,014 --> 00:53:04,916
and it won't burn your flowers.

729
00:53:05,183 --> 00:53:06,684
Just water, huh?

730
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:10,319
- Thanks. I'll try it.
- Okay.

731
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:19,957
Hey! Come here!

732
00:53:20,724 --> 00:53:21,791
Look at this!

733
00:53:41,667 --> 00:53:43,603
Your ex-husband lived
right up there, didn't he?

734
00:53:43,702 --> 00:53:46,437
Uh, y-yes, right up there on the hill,

735
00:53:46,537 --> 00:53:49,671
brooding down on me like Zeus.

736
00:53:49,972 --> 00:53:53,441
When we were married,
I always used to like this house.

737
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:56,075
As soon as we got divorced,
I moved in.

738
00:53:56,242 --> 00:54:01,044
But for years, Rudy and I couldn't
have been farther away from each other...

739
00:54:01,145 --> 00:54:03,745
if I'd bought a house on the Moon.

740
00:54:03,912 --> 00:54:05,779
- Are you sure you wouldn't like a drink?
- Oh, no.

741
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,047
Thank you very much.
Are they real?

742
00:54:08,148 --> 00:54:09,449
- Yes.
- May I?

743
00:54:09,549 --> 00:54:12,016
- Oh, of course. Help yourself.
- Thank you.

744
00:54:12,116 --> 00:54:14,251
So, uh, what changed all that?

745
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:17,019
I mean, how did you and Rudy
get to seeing one another again?

746
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:21,621
Well, we just bumped into each other
a couple of months ago.

747
00:54:21,988 --> 00:54:25,524
And, well, we were older...

748
00:54:26,023 --> 00:54:29,259
and he wasn't quite so stuffy anymore.

749
00:54:30,425 --> 00:54:32,760
And maybe I don't throw things...

750
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:36,095
like parties and handsome Italians
quite so much.

751
00:54:36,629 --> 00:54:38,630
Ma'am, I know you're in a hurry.
You wanna go shopping.

752
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:40,964
But I wondered first
if we could talk about...

753
00:54:41,064 --> 00:54:44,566
But you want to know
about that will thing.

754
00:54:44,666 --> 00:54:47,667
Of course. I-I don't blame you.

755
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:51,336
Uh, but don't misunderstand.

756
00:54:51,636 --> 00:54:53,803
Rudy and I weren't starting...

757
00:54:53,904 --> 00:54:57,039
to sing September songs
or anything like that.

758
00:54:57,139 --> 00:54:58,239
But...

759
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:02,108
Well, you see, years ago...

760
00:55:02,275 --> 00:55:04,776
I used to think I was artistic,

761
00:55:04,876 --> 00:55:08,244
and I literally dragged him
into his first museum.

762
00:55:09,012 --> 00:55:12,079
And that's how
his whole collection all began.

763
00:55:12,513 --> 00:55:17,082
Because naturally, Rudy started
sensing a good investment area.

764
00:55:17,183 --> 00:55:21,817
And some of the paintings
I liked weren't too bad.

765
00:55:22,351 --> 00:55:23,752
But it was my understanding that...

766
00:55:23,852 --> 00:55:25,953
it was his nephew
who picked out all his paintings.

767
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,688
Oh, yes, later on.

768
00:55:28,788 --> 00:55:31,323
But Dale was just in college then.

769
00:55:31,456 --> 00:55:35,758
Uh, that was just about the time when...

770
00:55:36,025 --> 00:55:39,693
when I started misbehaving.

771
00:55:40,394 --> 00:55:42,195
And then, of course, after our divorce,

772
00:55:42,295 --> 00:55:45,263
the collection became an obsession
with Rudy...

773
00:55:45,363 --> 00:55:47,398
and a whole career for Dale.

774
00:55:47,498 --> 00:55:48,631
So since you were in at the beginning,

775
00:55:48,731 --> 00:55:51,766
Mr. Matthews last month decided
to leave the whole collection to you?

776
00:55:52,033 --> 00:55:54,334
But he didn't want me to keep them.

777
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:57,369
- You don't think that, do you?
- Well...

778
00:55:58,136 --> 00:56:02,271
Oh, dear.
I guess nobody's going to understand.

779
00:56:02,505 --> 00:56:05,140
No. You see,

780
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:09,708
poor Rudy was finally tired of it,
that's all...

781
00:56:09,808 --> 00:56:13,510
all the greedy buying
and bidding and hoarding.

782
00:56:13,843 --> 00:56:16,879
He finally...
He finally agreed with me...

783
00:56:16,979 --> 00:56:22,114
that the people should own those lovely
things instead of just collectors.

784
00:56:22,882 --> 00:56:26,183
He decided to give them all away...

785
00:56:26,283 --> 00:56:28,284
to schools, museums.

786
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:31,453
Oh! But, oh, dear,

787
00:56:31,552 --> 00:56:35,021
it takes so much time to work that out...

788
00:56:35,121 --> 00:56:38,323
to decide which places get which.

789
00:56:38,423 --> 00:56:41,891
And in the meantime, he didn't want Dale
Kingston to get his hands on it. Is that it?

790
00:56:41,991 --> 00:56:44,125
I don't like to say that.

791
00:56:44,626 --> 00:56:49,561
I was just so happy that
Rudy was finally turning human.

792
00:56:51,896 --> 00:56:53,897
Who on Earth...

793
00:56:59,566 --> 00:57:02,868
Hello, Aunt Edna. May I come in?
How are you, dear?

794
00:57:02,969 --> 00:57:06,503
I didn't think you'd even remember
where I lived.

795
00:57:06,604 --> 00:57:10,072
Of course I do.
Got a message from a Lt. Col...

796
00:57:10,806 --> 00:57:13,840
Oh, there you are.
What's this all about?

797
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:16,041
- Is it about the gun?
- What?

798
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:19,043
Wait a minute.
What gun? What is all this?

799
00:57:19,143 --> 00:57:21,677
Well, I thought you'd be interested.
About a half hour ago,

800
00:57:21,777 --> 00:57:24,079
a gardener up on that hill there,

801
00:57:24,379 --> 00:57:26,480
he found a.38 revolver,

802
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:30,515
and it's the same kind as the one
that was missing from your uncle's desk.

803
00:57:30,849 --> 00:57:33,251
Uh, may I use your phone?

804
00:57:33,351 --> 00:57:34,918
Oh, yes, of course.

805
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:39,419
Isn't that silly?
Right up above my house.

806
00:57:39,853 --> 00:57:42,722
I-I've walked on that hill myself.

807
00:57:47,291 --> 00:57:48,458
Ballistics.

808
00:57:49,858 --> 00:57:52,994
Is this Charlie?
Lt. Columbo.

809
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:56,528
Charlie, I sent that stuff over there
over a half hour ago...

810
00:57:56,996 --> 00:58:00,264
Oh. Thank you.

811
00:58:03,199 --> 00:58:04,266
It's the murder gun, all right.

812
00:58:07,034 --> 00:58:08,768
Oh, there's nothing to be upset about.

813
00:58:08,868 --> 00:58:11,502
But I was just telling Dale,

814
00:58:11,602 --> 00:58:15,504
I-I go up there myself
when I want a breath of air.

815
00:58:15,604 --> 00:58:18,506
I even walked over to see Rudy
just the night before he was killed.

816
00:58:18,606 --> 00:58:20,607
Aunt Edna, I don't think
you oughta say another word.

817
00:58:20,707 --> 00:58:23,875
- The lieutenant may get the wrong idea.
- What?

818
00:58:25,609 --> 00:58:28,911
Oh, but-but surely
no one would think that I...

819
00:58:29,012 --> 00:58:29,911
Threw that gun there?

820
00:58:30,012 --> 00:58:33,080
Oh, no, Mrs. Matthews.
No, no, no, no, no.

821
00:58:33,347 --> 00:58:35,681
No, you see,
I finally figured out what happened.

822
00:58:35,814 --> 00:58:40,017
Whoever was in that house that night, they
ran out the back. They just kept on going.

823
00:58:40,117 --> 00:58:43,185
Well, naturally, they were anxious
to get rid of your ex-husband's gun.

824
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:44,986
It could've been anybody.

825
00:58:45,086 --> 00:58:48,087
- It could?
- Yes. Absolutely, it could.

826
00:58:48,488 --> 00:58:51,789
You have nothing to worry about.
Now, did you wanna go shopping?

827
00:58:54,524 --> 00:58:56,725
Well, I was planning to meet
some friends at the fashion center,

828
00:58:56,825 --> 00:58:57,992
but I can do that some other time.

829
00:58:58,092 --> 00:59:00,027
No, I want you to go right ahead,

830
00:59:00,127 --> 00:59:02,061
and I want you
to forget about all this.

831
00:59:02,161 --> 00:59:05,429
Just do what my wife does,
'cause when she hits a department store,

832
00:59:05,529 --> 00:59:09,364
she can forget anything, even the fact that
I'm sittin' outside waiting.

833
00:59:09,798 --> 00:59:12,066
- Have a good time, Edna.
- Bye.

834
00:59:17,036 --> 00:59:19,369
What are you trying to do to her?

835
00:59:20,337 --> 00:59:21,671
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

836
00:59:21,771 --> 00:59:22,872
Well, you know perfectly well...

837
00:59:22,972 --> 00:59:25,307
that it was a woman that ran out
of that place that night.

838
00:59:25,406 --> 00:59:28,308
- You said so yourself.
- Yeah, sure, but not her.

839
00:59:28,975 --> 00:59:31,342
Oh, I hope
you really mean that, Lieutenant...

840
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:33,977
that you're not just playing
some kind of a game with her.

841
00:59:34,077 --> 00:59:35,577
- A game?
- Yes. You know what I mean.

842
00:59:35,678 --> 00:59:39,846
Lulling her into a sense of false security.
Edna's a very vulnerable woman.

843
00:59:39,946 --> 00:59:43,581
Mr. Kingston, you've got me all wrong, really.
I wouldn't think of a thing like that.

844
00:59:43,682 --> 00:59:47,217
- That lady wouldn't hurt a fly.
- Lieutenant?

845
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:49,618
Can you come around here for a minute?

846
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:55,221
You told me not to bother you
until she'd gone.

847
00:59:55,487 --> 00:59:57,689
- What is it?
- Well, we found something else.

848
00:59:57,789 --> 01:00:00,223
She's got some trash cans back here.

849
01:00:04,125 --> 01:00:06,827
"Rudy Matthews, 417 Pine View."

850
01:00:06,927 --> 01:00:08,628
Looks like that piece of wrapping paper...

851
01:00:08,728 --> 01:00:11,896
that was torn from the rest of it
in his house. Remember?

852
01:00:12,697 --> 01:00:14,397
We figured the thief used it.

853
01:00:15,265 --> 01:00:16,465
All right, you'd better get that down...

854
01:00:16,565 --> 01:00:18,466
for fingerprinting and comparison
with the other paper.

855
01:00:18,566 --> 01:00:19,499
Is there anything else?

856
01:00:20,133 --> 01:00:22,468
No, we've covered
every inch of the grounds.

857
01:00:23,468 --> 01:00:24,936
Be careful with that.

858
01:00:31,339 --> 01:00:33,440
- Now what?
- I don't know.

859
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,608
I know what you're thinking, Lieutenant.

860
01:00:37,109 --> 01:00:39,643
The gun,
and now this new evidence.

861
01:00:40,510 --> 01:00:43,478
- Looks pretty bad for her.
- Yes, it does. Yes.

862
01:00:43,578 --> 01:00:47,547
I'm still convinced that Edna
had absolutely nothing to do with this.

863
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:50,115
You know, I think I agree with ya.

864
01:00:51,016 --> 01:00:53,550
Look at it this way.
If she's really guilty,

865
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:56,685
she's not gonna put that paper
in a garbage can, is she?

866
01:00:56,785 --> 01:00:59,753
I mean, she's probably gonna
burn it in the fireplace or somethin'.

867
01:01:01,253 --> 01:01:03,122
Yes, exactly.
That's the point.

868
01:01:03,321 --> 01:01:07,256
And you know something else, Mr. Kingston?
You're absolutely right about her.

869
01:01:07,357 --> 01:01:09,192
She's a...
What did you call it before?

870
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:12,960
- Vulnerable.
- Vulnerable, yes. She's a vulnerable woman.

871
01:01:13,194 --> 01:01:16,695
And I'm afraid that if I press her too hard,
she'll fall apart.

872
01:01:16,795 --> 01:01:17,795
Oh, yes.

873
01:01:17,895 --> 01:01:21,098
And I sure don't wanna make
the same mistake that I made with you.

874
01:01:21,964 --> 01:01:24,899
No, sir.
What I'm gonna do is this.

875
01:01:24,999 --> 01:01:28,868
I'm gonna sit on everything
until those stolen paintings show up.

876
01:01:29,301 --> 01:01:29,968
I see.

877
01:01:32,703 --> 01:01:35,437
I mean, that's the best way
to handle it, don't you think?

878
01:01:35,537 --> 01:01:36,805
Yes, yes, of course.

879
01:01:39,473 --> 01:01:42,441
I mean, I don't wanna go around
pointing my finger at anyone...

880
01:01:42,541 --> 01:01:44,609
until I have an airtight case.

881
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:47,543
- Right?
- Right.

882
01:01:49,211 --> 01:01:50,846
Uh, Lieutenant,

883
01:01:50,946 --> 01:01:53,913
your man said that you'd, uh...

884
01:01:54,013 --> 01:01:56,615
you'd covered every...
every inch of the place here.

885
01:01:56,715 --> 01:01:58,249
Did that include the inside of the house?

886
01:01:58,349 --> 01:02:00,650
Well, she gave us permission,
but I don't wanna bother.

887
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:04,319
Well, don't you think you should?
I mean, for her protection.

888
01:02:04,719 --> 01:02:08,020
And when you fail to find the paintings,
you can cross her name off the list entirely.

889
01:02:08,121 --> 01:02:09,421
Well, it hardly seems worth the trouble.

890
01:02:09,521 --> 01:02:11,455
Neither of us thinks she's guilty.
Why bother?

891
01:02:11,956 --> 01:02:15,858
Well, for her sake so she can be certain.
Search the house, Lieutenant.

892
01:02:16,725 --> 01:02:18,626
No, really,
I think it's a waste of time.

893
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:21,494
But if anything new comes up,
I'll let you know.

894
01:02:30,232 --> 01:02:33,500
Edna? She's utterly harmless.

895
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,535
Exactly.
That's why we've got to help her.

896
01:02:36,735 --> 01:02:38,603
But is there really
any danger of her arrest?

897
01:02:38,703 --> 01:02:40,904
You told me yourself
the lieutenant doesn't think she's guilty.

898
01:02:41,004 --> 01:02:43,872
That's today, Frank.
Who knows what he'll think tomorrow?

899
01:02:43,972 --> 01:02:47,673
In case you haven't noticed,
he is a very haphazard individual.

900
01:02:47,907 --> 01:02:50,609
Hmm. And if he doesn't
break the case soon?

901
01:02:50,709 --> 01:02:54,344
Exactly.
He starts looking for a scapegoat...

902
01:02:54,444 --> 01:02:56,612
because the pressure's
building up on him,

903
01:02:56,712 --> 01:02:59,312
and Edna's the most
obvious candidate.

904
01:03:00,414 --> 01:03:02,548
Well, what should we do?

905
01:03:04,182 --> 01:03:05,649
Protect her.

906
01:03:06,016 --> 01:03:09,551
I'm sure Rudy would've wanted
both of us to look out for her interests.

907
01:03:09,651 --> 01:03:11,986
She trusts you, Frank.

908
01:03:12,186 --> 01:03:16,321
Get her in here. Talk to her like a
Dutch uncle. Fill her in on the situation.

909
01:03:16,688 --> 01:03:20,223
You're sure we should
allow her house to be searched?

910
01:03:20,323 --> 01:03:23,758
Absolutely. In fact, I think you ought
to recommend that we insist on it.

911
01:03:23,858 --> 01:03:27,593
And that way, we get it on the record that
nothing has been found to incriminate her.

912
01:03:30,028 --> 01:03:34,164
All right. Miss Henderson,
get me Mrs. Matthews.

913
01:03:34,264 --> 01:03:37,765
Oh, uh, she's shopping
at the fashion center in Beverly Hills.

914
01:03:37,865 --> 01:03:41,100
You could bring her in here right now
and clarify this whole thing.

915
01:03:43,101 --> 01:03:46,270
Miss Henderson, have her paged
at the fashion center.

916
01:03:47,037 --> 01:03:48,204
We'll clear it up today.

917
01:03:49,005 --> 01:03:53,139
Well, there may be
one small hitch to that.

918
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:56,608
Unfortunately, Lt. Columbo
refuses to search the house.

919
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:59,609
- He claims it to be a waste of time.
- Oh?

920
01:04:00,243 --> 01:04:03,511
Which merely perpetuates
Edna's anxiety.

921
01:04:03,845 --> 01:04:06,880
I really wish there was something
we could do about that man, Frank.

922
01:04:07,947 --> 01:04:11,882
Well, perhaps there's, um,
some way around him.

923
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:14,117
You really think so?

924
01:04:14,384 --> 01:04:17,618
I have a few friends at city hall.
Let me look into it.

925
01:04:18,252 --> 01:04:19,786
Fine. Thank you.

926
01:04:19,953 --> 01:04:22,888
I'll just run one little errand,
and I'll be right back.

927
01:04:22,988 --> 01:04:25,322
Fine. Fine.
Uh, Miss Henderson,

928
01:04:25,422 --> 01:04:28,991
after I talk to Mrs. Matthews,
I want the police department.

929
01:04:29,191 --> 01:04:30,459
Dale?

930
01:04:32,059 --> 01:04:34,794
Edna does have an excellent motive.

931
01:04:34,894 --> 01:04:38,296
You, uh... You don't think
there's any chance...

932
01:04:38,963 --> 01:04:41,096
Of course not.

933
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:43,865
You oughta be ashamed of yourself, Frank.

934
01:04:45,499 --> 01:04:47,934
Yeah. Sorry.

935
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:31,652
I just don't understand any of this.

936
01:06:31,752 --> 01:06:35,020
It's just a precautionary measure,
Aunt Edna, nothing more.

937
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:38,623
But what do you want them
to search my house for?

938
01:06:38,723 --> 01:06:42,157
- What will they find?
- Absolutely nothing. That's just the point.

939
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:44,158
Now, come on.

940
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:48,127
- Frank.
- Mm-hmm.

941
01:06:49,027 --> 01:06:50,729
Where, uh...
Where do you want me to put these?

942
01:06:50,829 --> 01:06:53,096
Oh, uh, in there.

943
01:06:53,196 --> 01:06:55,998
Anywhere.
Oh, I need a drink.

944
01:06:56,098 --> 01:06:59,432
Of course you do, darling.
So do I. Let me fix it for you.

945
01:06:59,699 --> 01:07:01,267
Here are your keys.

946
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:03,801
- Still scotch?
- Yes.

947
01:07:04,235 --> 01:07:07,703
- How about you, Frank? A drink?
- Yes, on the rocks, please.

948
01:07:08,137 --> 01:07:11,138
I'm sorry we have to put you through this now.
But believe me,

949
01:07:11,238 --> 01:07:13,206
it'll all be over soon, huh?

950
01:07:13,339 --> 01:07:17,108
Why would anyone think that
I'd want to kill Rudy?

951
01:07:17,208 --> 01:07:18,876
Nobody does.

952
01:07:19,109 --> 01:07:21,977
We just wanna make sure
that it stays that way, that's all.

953
01:07:22,077 --> 01:07:25,312
That's why Frank is having the police
come in and search the house.

954
01:07:25,712 --> 01:07:27,513
Believe me, it's all for the best.

955
01:07:27,613 --> 01:07:31,282
Dale, I don't even remember
what happened...

956
01:07:31,382 --> 01:07:33,550
the night Rudy was killed.

957
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:37,552
I get so nervous,
I-I take sleeping pills sometimes.

958
01:07:37,652 --> 01:07:40,053
- That's one thing you should...
- Oh!

959
01:07:40,986 --> 01:07:42,655
Oh! Excuse me.

960
01:07:42,755 --> 01:07:45,422
Let me just dry off.
I'll be right back.

961
01:07:48,691 --> 01:07:50,559
Oh, isn't that a shame?

962
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:53,459
Uh, Frank...

963
01:08:36,615 --> 01:08:39,549
Frank, must we go through this?

964
01:08:39,649 --> 01:08:42,017
Edna, you will be
so much better off...

965
01:08:44,851 --> 01:08:46,019
Come on. Come on.

966
01:08:48,087 --> 01:08:49,988
Nothing to be nervous about now.

967
01:08:50,221 --> 01:08:51,221
Go ahead.

968
01:08:56,425 --> 01:08:59,559
Miss Matthews?
Captain Wyler, police department.

969
01:08:59,859 --> 01:09:02,161
Yes. Please, come in.

970
01:09:02,261 --> 01:09:03,361
Thank you.

971
01:09:52,386 --> 01:09:53,753
Sorry. You can't go in there.

972
01:09:54,387 --> 01:09:56,921
I'm a lieutenant, so, do you mind?

973
01:09:57,021 --> 01:09:58,822
It's okay, Ferguson. Let him in.

974
01:10:00,923 --> 01:10:03,091
- Hi, Captain.
- Columbo.

975
01:10:03,691 --> 01:10:06,892
- Uh... Oh, hi, Mr. Kingston.
- Hello, Lieutenant.

976
01:10:06,993 --> 01:10:08,394
Listen, I just heard about this.

977
01:10:08,494 --> 01:10:11,161
Word came down from above
to have the place searched.

978
01:10:11,261 --> 01:10:12,096
Is that so?

979
01:10:12,196 --> 01:10:14,830
Yeah. And I can't understand why.

980
01:10:14,930 --> 01:10:19,766
The fact is, I was kind of bypassed
when I came over here.

981
01:10:19,866 --> 01:10:22,134
Well, apparently you're
just not needed here then, Lieutenant.

982
01:10:22,234 --> 01:10:24,335
Why don't you just go home
and have your dinner?

983
01:10:24,435 --> 01:10:26,603
Oh, no, I'd better hang around,
because, you know,

984
01:10:26,703 --> 01:10:30,005
if I leave now,
it looks bad upstairs, you know.

985
01:10:35,273 --> 01:10:38,775
Oh, hello, Mrs. Matthews.
Mr. Simpson.

986
01:10:38,875 --> 01:10:41,143
Gee, I hope this is not
upsetting you too much.

987
01:10:41,243 --> 01:10:46,480
Well, I'm not very happy
about my house being torn apart.

988
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:49,648
But they advised me to do it.

989
01:10:49,748 --> 01:10:50,848
- They?
- Who is "they"?

990
01:10:50,948 --> 01:10:53,516
Mr. Kingston and I
thought it was necessary, Lieutenant.

991
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:56,652
Oh, I see. Oh.

992
01:10:56,751 --> 01:11:00,153
It's really very confusing.

993
01:11:00,753 --> 01:11:05,455
You said you didn't suspect me
of anything, didn't you?

994
01:11:05,555 --> 01:11:07,657
Yes, I did, ma'am, and I meant that.

995
01:11:07,757 --> 01:11:10,625
- And, actually, I was opposed to...
- Captain Wyler.

996
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:16,328
Clear this table.

997
01:11:26,099 --> 01:11:27,133
Where'd you find those?

998
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:30,268
Linen closet in the hallway.

999
01:11:31,769 --> 01:11:34,671
Edna, how could you?

1000
01:11:36,104 --> 01:11:38,339
Dale, believe me,

1001
01:11:38,439 --> 01:11:41,640
I have no idea how they got there!

1002
01:11:43,608 --> 01:11:45,642
- You'd better not say another word.
- But...

1003
01:11:45,742 --> 01:11:48,210
Edna, he's right.

1004
01:11:49,177 --> 01:11:51,045
Do you intend
to charge her formally, Captain?

1005
01:11:51,145 --> 01:11:53,579
It's up to Lt. Columbo.
It's his case.

1006
01:11:53,813 --> 01:11:55,347
What do you mean it's his case?
I thought it was...

1007
01:11:55,447 --> 01:11:57,715
We know what you thought,
Mr. Kingston.

1008
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:00,483
Lieutenant?

1009
01:12:01,283 --> 01:12:04,152
Well, I think we can
get started with the fingerprinting.

1010
01:12:04,252 --> 01:12:05,485
Let's get the kit.

1011
01:12:09,954 --> 01:12:12,089
Careful, there.
Be very careful.

1012
01:12:13,990 --> 01:12:15,824
Gee, they're something, aren't they?

1013
01:12:15,991 --> 01:12:17,425
Pastels, you know.

1014
01:12:19,292 --> 01:12:21,160
May I ask
what this is all about, Lieutenant?

1015
01:12:21,393 --> 01:12:23,227
- Both of 'em.
- Lieutenant?

1016
01:12:23,327 --> 01:12:24,328
Oh, Mr. Kingston.

1017
01:12:24,628 --> 01:12:27,463
Uh, yes, just give us a moment, please.
Do you mind?

1018
01:12:27,830 --> 01:12:30,065
- We're getting a few.
- Good.

1019
01:12:31,432 --> 01:12:33,266
I'd like an answer, if you don't mind.

1020
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:38,269
Uh, well, I'd have to start
with your uncle's will.

1021
01:12:38,868 --> 01:12:39,636
What about it?

1022
01:12:40,603 --> 01:12:42,237
Well, you see, he pulled a rug
out from under you...

1023
01:12:42,337 --> 01:12:44,038
when he left his collection
to Mrs. Matthews.

1024
01:12:44,138 --> 01:12:46,772
So you only had
one thing that you could do...

1025
01:12:47,273 --> 01:12:49,741
murder him and blame it on her.

1026
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:57,578
I hope you realize the full import
of what you're saying, Lieutenant.

1027
01:12:57,678 --> 01:12:59,145
There are witnesses here.

1028
01:13:00,046 --> 01:13:03,381
You see, under the law, anyone who criminally
causes the death of someone else...

1029
01:13:03,481 --> 01:13:04,848
can't inherit from that person.

1030
01:13:04,948 --> 01:13:07,349
- Is that right, Mr. Simpson?
- That's correct.

1031
01:13:10,385 --> 01:13:13,553
So if Mrs. Matthews is convicted,
you're next in line.

1032
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:17,121
Everything goes to you.
That's why you planted the gun,

1033
01:13:17,488 --> 01:13:19,756
and that's why
you planted the wrapping paper,

1034
01:13:19,956 --> 01:13:21,757
and that's why
you planted these paintings.

1035
01:13:21,857 --> 01:13:26,560
Dale! I can't believe it!

1036
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:30,794
But you'd like to, wouldn't you?
Get you right off the hook.

1037
01:13:31,528 --> 01:13:32,895
All right, Lieutenant.

1038
01:13:32,995 --> 01:13:36,797
You claimed that I planted these paintings?
Suppose you prove it.

1039
01:13:37,998 --> 01:13:39,733
- Can we?
- Yeah.

1040
01:13:40,533 --> 01:13:42,633
Yeah... with fingerprints.

1041
01:13:42,867 --> 01:13:47,203
Sorry to disappoint you, Lieutenant.
Fingerprints won't help you at all.

1042
01:13:47,303 --> 01:13:49,804
My fingerprints are all over
those paintings.

1043
01:13:49,904 --> 01:13:52,072
My uncle and I unwrapped them
when they came back from the exhibit.

1044
01:13:52,172 --> 01:13:56,074
I told you, didn't I? I told you myself.
They're covered with my prints.

1045
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,975
No, we're not looking for your prints.

1046
01:14:02,677 --> 01:14:03,344
What?

1047
01:14:03,811 --> 01:14:05,979
Do you remember the time
that I was in your apartment,

1048
01:14:06,079 --> 01:14:07,813
and you came in with some paintings?

1049
01:14:08,147 --> 01:14:11,315
And you said that they were watercolors,
and you wanted to evaluate 'em.

1050
01:14:11,515 --> 01:14:15,550
And remember I wanted to see 'em, and
you wouldn't let me? And I even touched 'em.

1051
01:14:17,685 --> 01:14:19,052
You touched...

1052
01:14:19,419 --> 01:14:21,687
Yes, my fingerprints
are on those paintings.

1053
01:14:23,454 --> 01:14:25,722
Now, if Mrs. Matthews is guilty,

1054
01:14:26,356 --> 01:14:29,424
how could my fingerprints
get on paintings that she stole?

1055
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:39,229
Uh, this is entrapment.

1056
01:14:40,996 --> 01:14:42,597
It's a setup, that's all.

1057
01:14:42,697 --> 01:14:47,333
You-You-You-You touched those paintings
just now while I wasn't looking.

1058
01:14:47,433 --> 01:14:50,268
You saw him do it, didn't you?
You put your prints on those paintings...

1059
01:14:50,368 --> 01:14:52,369
while you were bent over watching them
while they were working on it!

1060
01:14:52,469 --> 01:14:55,070
He touched them!
You touched... You...
