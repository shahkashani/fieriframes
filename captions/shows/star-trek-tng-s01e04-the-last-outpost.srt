1
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:06,007
<i>Captain's log, stardate 41386.4.</i>

2
00:00:06,215 --> 00:00:09,385
<i>We are in pursuit of a starship
of Ferengi design.</i>

3
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:11,220
<i>Our mission is to intercept</i>

4
00:00:11,387 --> 00:00:14,724
<i>and recover a T-9 energy converter
which the Ferengi stole</i>

5
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:17,727
<i>from an unmanned monitor post
on Gamma Tauri IV.</i>

6
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:19,687
<i>A theft which automatic
scanners recorded,</i>

7
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:22,606
<i>providing us
with the long-awaited opportunity</i>

8
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:26,110
<i>to make close contact
with a Ferengi vessel.</i>

9
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:30,990
<i>If we succeed in this chase, it will be
Starfleet's first look at a life form</i>

10
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:35,870
<i>which, discounting rumor,
we know almost nothing about.</i>

11
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:38,205
There she is.

12
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,043
Enlarge.

13
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:48,007
What is their course?

14
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:51,135
They are now angling
through that solar system, captain.

15
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:54,805
- Identify.
- Listed as Delphi Ardu, sir.

16
00:00:55,014 --> 00:00:56,724
Eleven planets, unexplored.

17
00:00:57,475 --> 00:00:59,769
- Stay with them, La Forge.
- Aye, sir.

18
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,817
Sensors read a power surge
from their last maneuver, captain.

19
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:10,988
They are dropping to sub-warp speed.

20
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,949
Reduce to impulse power.

21
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,872
Sensors record fluctuations
in the energy readings from it, captain.

22
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:21,332
Possibility:

23
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,752
- A malfunction in their engines, sir.
- Breaks my heart.

24
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:26,712
In visual range, captain.

25
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:28,297
Fully enlarge.

26
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,054
Hello, stranger.

27
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,431
Very impressive design.

28
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,058
Anything on that design, Data?

29
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,935
Nothing specific, sir.

30
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:43,145
As you know,
Ferengi technology is estimated

31
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:44,939
to be generally equal to our own.

32
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:48,192
But that does not mean
identical, however.

33
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:49,985
Correct, sir.

34
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:52,571
We are no doubt advanced
in some areas, they in others.

35
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,156
Showing another power surge, sir.

36
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:58,285
They are firing on us.

37
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,496
- Damage report.
- Shields holding.

38
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,290
Mostly electromagnetic.

39
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:05,793
Fusion generator
and batteries down by 30 percent.

40
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,753
Our impulse engines
are surging now.

41
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:10,256
They're firing again.

42
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:15,469
Deflector shield power
weakening, captain.

43
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,513
Phasers ready.

44
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,306
Photon torpedoes ready.

45
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:26,522
- Do we return their fire, sir?
- Negative, Number One.

46
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,233
They're just responding
to our close pursuit.

47
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:31,944
Fall back a bit, but stay with them.

48
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:36,407
They are slowing too, sir.

49
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,416
They may be turning to fight.

50
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:52,423
Open hailing frequen-- Why are we
gaining on them? Don't anticipate.

51
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,258
I'm not, sir. Something's wrong.

52
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,427
Sir, something is dragging us forward.

53
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,223
I read that too.

54
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,976
Lieutenant Yar,
what do your sensors show?

55
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:07,521
Not certain, sir.
I'm getting very confusing readings.

56
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,232
Captain, this shouldn't be.

57
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:12,276
Our power systems are failing.

58
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,361
Deflector shield failing.

59
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,322
Phasers going inoperative, captain.

60
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,824
Captain, something
is completely immobilizing us.

61
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:22,328
Immobilized by the damn Ferengi?

62
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,413
I need more information.

63
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:26,248
What the hell are they using?

64
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,721
Obviously we've underestimated
their technology, captain.

65
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,598
Considerably.

66
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:49,104
It appears the Ferengi have us
right where they want us:

67
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,732
In their sights.

68
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,966
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

69
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:21,595
<i>These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.</i>

70
00:04:21,804 --> 00:04:26,934
<i>Its continuing mission:
to explore strange new worlds,</i>

71
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:31,689
<i>to seek out new life
and new civilizations,</i>

72
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:36,568
<i>to boldly go where no one
has gone before.</i>

73
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:49,016
Are you searching all
frequencies? Is there any message?

74
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,893
Negative, sir.

75
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:53,937
Weapons report, lieutenant.

76
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,231
I have phasers
and torpedoes armed.

77
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,859
But I show insufficient power
to fire them.

78
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:03,072
Engineering, give me status
on power recovery.

79
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,950
Engineering, come in.

80
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:11,705
Why aren't they answering?

81
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:13,665
- La Forge.
- Sir?

82
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,502
- Get me a full report from Engineering.
- Aye, sir.

83
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,756
It's impossible they could be
draining all power from all systems.

84
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:23,050
Counselor?

85
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,178
I'm sensing nothing from them, sir.

86
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:30,307
Which could mean they can shield their
thoughts and emotions from others.

87
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:31,850
Which still makes it our move.

88
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:35,312
Sir, they may know as little about us
as we do about them.

89
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:38,357
Except that they know
that they've got us in deep trouble.

90
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,693
If so, then the question becomes
what do they do with that knowledge?

91
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:45,989
Data, do you have any information
touching this on any file?

92
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:50,285
None, sir. Only hearsay and third-hand
reports, most of which conflict.

93
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:52,663
Which reports do not conflict?

94
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:55,207
That the Ferengi are--

95
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,043
Well, the best description
may be traders.

96
00:06:58,252 --> 00:06:59,753
What kind of traders?

97
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:02,464
A comparison modern scholars
have drawn from Earth history

98
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:05,551
likens the Ferengi
to the ocean-going Yankee traders

99
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,761
of 18- and 19-century America, sir.

100
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,764
From the history of my forebears.
Yankee traders.

101
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,891
Who, in this case, sail the galaxy

102
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,769
in search of mercantile
and territorial opportunity.

103
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:18,981
And are these scholars saying
that the Ferengi may not be unlike us?

104
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:23,819
Hardly, sir. I believe the analogy refers
to the worst quality of capitalists.

105
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,405
The Ferengi are believed
to conduct their affairs of commerce

106
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,658
on the ancient principle
caveat emptor.

107
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:31,910
"Let the buyer beware."

108
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:34,413
Yankee traders.
I like the sound of that.

109
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,957
Well, sir,
I doubt they wear red, white and blue

110
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,042
or look anything like Uncle Sam.

111
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:40,461
Engineering?

112
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,671
Join La Forge down below
in Engineering, Number One.

113
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:44,423
Aye, sir.

114
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:48,886
Without warp capacity,
we're just a floating target.

115
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:51,305
Uncle who?

116
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,350
What have bright primary colors
got to do with it?

117
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,811
Oh, I understand the allusion.

118
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:02,316
Colors representing countries at a time
when they competed with each other.

119
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,776
Red, white and blue
for the United States.

120
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:09,823
Whereas the French more properly
used the same colors

121
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:12,618
in the order blue, white and red.

122
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,786
And the German nation,
red, black and gold.

123
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,872
The Italians, green, white and red
British--

124
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,041
- That's enough, Data.
- It was you who--

125
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,835
We were discussing the Ferengi.

126
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,590
I wish I had some clue
as to what they will do next.

127
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,759
Given what is now happening
to our ship, sir,

128
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,929
their weapons could be vastly
superior to ours.

129
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,767
Yes, Data,
that is a natural assumption.

130
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,436
Engineering?

131
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:42,814
- Bottom line, La Forge.
- Ah, it's not good, sir.

132
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,943
Ferengi force field that holds this ship
compensates almost as fast

133
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,028
- as we can increase power.
- Almost?

134
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:52,032
Well, there's a 0.372 millisecond delay
between the use of our power

135
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:54,243
and the neutralizing counterforce
of the Ferengis.

136
00:08:55,285 --> 00:09:00,457
See, we push, and they push back
with equal force, sir.

137
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,719
What's our acceleration delay

138
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:15,556
between slow-reverse impulse
and top warp speed?

139
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:19,476
Well, that's 0.300 milliseconds.
There's...

140
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,938
Ah, I see where you're going.

141
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,566
We shift down,
then kick hard into warp 9.

142
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,693
Yeah, come back fighting.
Whoo-ee!

143
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:31,196
- Can we do it, Geordi?
- Ask me after it's done, sir.

144
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:35,742
I want a slow reverse into drop-off
over five minutes.

145
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,578
We'll show them
what this baby can do, sir.

146
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,037
Give it everything you've got.

147
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,373
Aye, aye, sir.

148
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:48,380
In a sudden, abrupt power
surge to high warp speed, captain,

149
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:52,009
we may be able to break loose
from that Ferengi force field.

150
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:54,970
I wish I knew
what they were thinking over there.

151
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,057
They're wondering
what we're going to do next.

152
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,144
I say fight, sir.

153
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,522
There's nothing shameful
in falling before a superior enemy.

154
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:08,734
And nothing shameful
in a strategic retreat, either.

155
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,236
All systems ready, captain.

156
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,614
And communication now restored
to Engineering.

157
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,365
Excellent, La Forge.

158
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:20,287
Now let's, uh, throw them off guard.

159
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,789
Lieutenant Yar,
open hailing frequencies.

160
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,335
Hailing frequencies open, sir.

161
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,379
At least we won't begin
with weakness.

162
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,923
Attention, Ferengi starship.

163
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:35,636
This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard
of the USS Enterprise.

164
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:37,679
In the name
of the United Federation of Planets,

165
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:40,807
I demand that you return
the T-9 energy converter

166
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:44,227
you removed from Gamma Tauri IV.

167
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,859
Send that in all language forms.

168
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,444
All language forms, sir.

169
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:56,490
Sometimes, Riker,
the best way to fight is not to be there.

170
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:59,826
Yes, sir. "He will triumph
who knows when to fight

171
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,995
- and when not to fight."
Hmm.

172
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:05,499
Glad the Academy is still teaching
the strategies of Sun Tzu.

173
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:08,460
This delay had better prove out,
La Forge.

174
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,754
Point-300 milliseconds, sir.

175
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:14,383
Let's blast full power into warp 9.
Ready?

176
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,967
On your command, captain.

177
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:19,179
On the count of three.
Stand by on phasers.

178
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:23,558
One. Set warp to nine.

179
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:27,813
Two.
Divert shield power to main engines.

180
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,690
Three.

181
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:52,045
Merde.

182
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,131
Shields up.

183
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:06,393
Captain,
I think you had better see this.

184
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,729
What's wrong?

185
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,564
Someone is reading every file,

186
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:14,109
every bit of information stored
in the Enterprise memory banks.

187
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,694
They can do that?

188
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:17,779
And more, perhaps.

189
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:25,787
Captain, if I may recommend,

190
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:31,501
with our attention on the Ferengi vessel,
we have ignored the planet.

191
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:36,882
Data, consult the charts on this planet.
See what we've got on it.

192
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:42,512
Conference evaluation.

193
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,521
So while we still have some power left,
it's time for difficult decisions.

194
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:54,149
- Opinions, please.
- I say put all available power

195
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:57,569
into a full-out combined phaser
and photon torpedo salvo.

196
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:00,071
Destroy their ability
to sustain this force field, sir.

197
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,033
Yes, hit them hard and hit them fast.

198
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,868
Impractical.

199
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,078
And provocative.

200
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,332
Even assuming that we have
the power to sustain such a tactic.

201
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,043
But, captain,
isn't firing on us an act of war?

202
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:18,507
The facts are the Ferengis did
fire on us, but we were chasing them.

203
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,051
Since then, all they've done
is search our computers,

204
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:22,969
trying to learn who and what we are.

205
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,680
- Your point, counselor?
- Let's talk to them.

206
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:27,516
It's been tried. No response.

207
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,937
But did we tell them anything
they wanted to hear?

208
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,324
La Forge?

209
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,869
Other opinions?

210
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:50,121
Thank you for your advice.

211
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,294
Will?

212
00:13:58,088 --> 00:13:59,548
I haven't heard your assessment.

213
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:04,761
I believe we've covered
every available option, captain.

214
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:07,973
Are there other options
that you wanna analyze?

215
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:12,143
The only one remaining is the one
that needs no conversation.

216
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,188
- The one we must avoid.
- Sir?

217
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:19,401
The one that leads
to total annihilation.

218
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,252
- Open hailing frequencies.
- Open, sir.

219
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:45,719
Attention, Ferengi starship.
This is Captain Picard.

220
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:51,349
It is obvious that we are in a situation
here which needs resolving.

221
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:57,355
And we are willing to do
whatever is required,

222
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,399
whatever is necessary.

223
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,614
I would like--

224
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:12,120
I would request
that you present your terms to us.

225
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:28,553
<i>Captain's log, stardate 41386. 5.</i>

226
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,555
<i>It is with a heavy heart
that I have offered</i>

227
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,433
<i>to meet whatever reasonable
and necessary terms</i>

228
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,518
<i>are demanded by the Ferengi.</i>

229
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:37,771
<i>I fear for my people and my vessel</i>

230
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:42,025
<i>in the event the unknown Ferengi
ask the unreasonable.</i>

231
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:45,695
<i>How can I oppose
even unreasonable demands?</i>

232
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:46,947
It's moving, sir.

233
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:52,827
We ask to surrender
and now they fire on us?

234
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:55,956
Ready torpedoes, sir? We have
enough power for a few of them.

235
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:59,042
Ready, but hold on ready.

236
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,752
Open hailing frequencies.

237
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:02,963
Hailing frequencies open, sir.

238
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:07,842
Ferengi vessel,
we await your response.

239
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,594
Suggest first strike, sir.

240
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:13,014
Our shields now only have 63 seconds
of power left before lowering.

241
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:15,600
If the Ferengi ship's sensors
can read us, sir,

242
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,978
they will be waiting
until we are most vulnerable.

243
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:20,105
I'm afraid I agree.
They have not responded.

244
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,190
We will wait a bit more,
Number One.

245
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,275
Fifty seconds.

246
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:28,780
Patience. Patience.

247
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,367
<i>The quicker we can come to terms,</i>

248
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:36,538
the better, NCC-1701-D.

249
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,415
Who is speaking?

250
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:42,794
<i>I am Tarr, daimon of the Ferengi.</i>

251
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:46,172
<i>You wish to discuss surrender,
Captain Picard?</i>

252
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,842
What I said, Daimon Tarr, is--

253
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:55,598
<i>Unconditional surrender,
I warn you, is totally unacceptable.</i>

254
00:16:56,266 --> 00:17:00,311
<i>We will die to the last one of us
before such dishonor.</i>

255
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,818
Hailing frequencies closed, sir.

256
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:10,405
Something has seized their ship too.
They're in the same predicament as us.

257
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,034
Launch a sensor probe.

258
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:17,203
Set it to search for the source
of whatever this something is

259
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,872
that is holding both ships.

260
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,374
Go back to hailing frequency, fast.

261
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:25,128
And I regret, Daimon Tarr,

262
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:30,175
that I can no longer negotiate
unless it is conducted visually.

263
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,719
<i>Your complete message
not received, Enterprise.</i>

264
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,972
<i>But visual communication
is against our custom.</i>

265
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:39,434
And it is against Starfleet orders
to accept a surrender otherwise.

266
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:42,228
Do you withdraw your surrender?

267
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,780
<i>You give us no choice, Enterprise.</i>

268
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:55,325
<i>May we have a visual on you
as well?</i>

269
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,661
Agreed, Daimon Tarr.

270
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:02,082
You should be able to view us now.
Are we on your screen?

271
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,333
<i>Yes.</i>

272
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,878
<i>The ugliness of the human
was not an exaggeration.</i>

273
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:10,965
<i>I do not know how your twisted alien
culture has paralyzed our vessel,</i>

274
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:13,510
<i>but I concede your Enterprise
is superior.</i>

275
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,678
<i>We will return
your worthless T-9 device</i>

276
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:17,806
<i>and we offer the lives
of our second officers</i>

277
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,683
<i>as required by the Ferengi code.</i>

278
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:25,647
Fortunately Starfleet has no such rules
involving its second officers.

279
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:29,943
<i>Is this to your satisfaction,
Picard Captain?</i>

280
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:34,864
Your offer may be inadequate,
but I will discuss it with my staff.

281
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,658
Stand by for further communication.

282
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,874
Matthew, Pola.
You know this area is off limits.

283
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,377
Come on, come on, come on.

284
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:49,921
Boys will be boys, captain.

285
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,422
Have you launched the probe?

286
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,384
Aye, sir. We should be getting
those readings soon.

287
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:56,719
Well, if we're not holding the Ferengi

288
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,680
and they're not holding us,
who the hell is?

289
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,766
Well, the probe will give us
some of those answers, sir.

290
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,311
Data, you were going
to show us something?

291
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,147
As requested, captain,

292
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:10,275
library-computer information
on this planet.

293
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:13,778
It has been charted only
from long-range scans.

294
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:18,741
It is class M, but shows no indication
of life forms, sentient or otherwise.

295
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:21,870
However,
you may find this of interest.

296
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:25,165
Resolving it into our language.

297
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:30,628
The center of a huge space federation.
A population of trillions.

298
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,297
Trillions?

299
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,341
I've never heard the word
"Tkon" before.

300
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:40,722
Understandable.
It has been extinct for 600,000 of our--

301
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,893
Of our years.

302
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:52,525
These planets were once outposts
of that empire.

303
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:54,194
Data, what are you doing?

304
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:57,238
Apologies, captain.

305
00:19:57,447 --> 00:20:02,702
I seem to have reached
an odd functional impasse.

306
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:07,040
I am, uh, stuck.

307
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:09,459
Then get unstuck
and continue with the briefing.

308
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,878
Yes, sir.
That is what I am trying to do, sir.

309
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:16,382
But the solution eludes me.

310
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,260
My hero, ha-ha-ha.

311
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:25,725
Continue, commander.

312
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:32,273
Intriguing. It de-Uh--

313
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:36,527
It describes the Empire as being
highly advanced and powerful,

314
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,405
and capable of actually moving stars.

315
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:42,242
Stars whose planets
are their defense system?

316
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,619
Correct, sir. Outposts.

317
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,996
The planet below
was possibly one of them.

318
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:50,166
<i>Excuse
the interruption, but this may be worth it.</i>

319
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,002
<i>We're now receiving a signal
from the probe.</i>

320
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,546
We'll take it here.

321
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:00,510
Incredible.

322
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:03,096
- Our mysterious something, captain.
- Hmm.

323
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:07,850
- It is a force field of some kind.
- Reaching up from the planet surface.

324
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:09,394
Amazing power.

325
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:13,273
Data, what does the legend say
about the end of the Tkon Empire?

326
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:14,941
Their sun went supernova, sir.

327
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,568
Could this planet have escaped that?

328
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,156
This planet may have been
the most distant outpost, sir.

329
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:24,033
But it shows no life-form readings.

330
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:29,038
We should take a look at it.
Stand by with an away team.

331
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:31,332
And if the Ferengi also realize

332
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,334
the force field emanates
from the planet, sir?

333
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,628
Hmm, that's a complication.

334
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:37,672
Maybe we should ask them
to join us in this.

335
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,340
Team up with the Ferengi, sir'?

336
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:41,551
We've been ordered
to learn all we can about them.

337
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,636
Do you know a better way?

338
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:47,765
Data.

339
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,443
<i>Captain's log, supplemental.</i>

340
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:02,071
<i>In orbit of a mysterious planet
whose unexplained force field</i>

341
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,034
<i>has seized us with a power
almost beyond imagination.</i>

342
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,202
<i>If there is a solution to this,</i>

343
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:11,831
<i>it almost certainly will involve
cooperation from the Ferengi.</i>

344
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,250
Ship's power drain is critical, captain.

345
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:17,295
I must now shut down our shields
to maintain life support systems.

346
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,213
Understood.

347
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:22,759
Open hailing frequencies.

348
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,261
Hailing frequencies open, sir.

349
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,431
Ferengi vessel from Enterprise,
come in.

350
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:35,021
<i>Your alien images again shock us.</i>

351
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:38,149
With regard to surrender, Daimon Tarr,
the facts are somewhat different.

352
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:41,319
<i>Our own probe has already
shown us your trickery, human.</i>

353
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:45,114
<i>- We withdraw our surrender.
- Agreed.</i>

354
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:49,535
Perhaps you would agree
to a more productive relationship.

355
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:52,747
<i>I prefer</i> a <i>more profitable one
human.</i>

356
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,082
Yankee trader.

357
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:57,001
<i>Explain what means
"Yankee traders."</i>

358
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:58,211
He heard that.

359
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:03,299
It recognizes your interest in profit.
Or is that an incorrect assumption?

360
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:06,928
<i>We seek only what is equitable.
What do you seek?</i>

361
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:08,930
<i>Why did you begin by attacking us?</i>

362
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,181
We did not attack you.

363
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,643
We gave chase in order to recover
a Federation-owned energy device

364
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,269
- which--
- <i>Which we know is ours.</i>

365
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:18,189
<i>Your barbarous Federation
placed it on one of our planets.</i>

366
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:21,734
On the contrary, Gamma Tauri IV is
recognized by all civilized members of--

367
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:24,195
<i>The Ferengi
are not uncivilized, human.</i>

368
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:27,198
<i>Are you suggesting otherwise?</i>

369
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:32,662
All I'm saying
is that you removed something

370
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,747
which clearly did not belong to you.

371
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:37,458
<i>Are you now calling us thieves?</i>

372
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:38,876
On the contrary.

373
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:41,462
I have no wish to discuss issues
of property or territory

374
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:43,381
while our mutual problem remains.

375
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:46,634
Like it or not, we are both trapped

376
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:51,139
by this energy-draining force field
from the planet.

377
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,395
<i>On that matter,
there can be no argument.</i>

378
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:01,441
I would like to propose a swap.

379
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:04,152
<i>And what is a swap?</i>

380
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,946
It's a trade, uh, an exchange.

381
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:10,074
<i>Yes, trade, human.
What do you offer?</i>

382
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:12,118
We'd tell you
what we know about the planet,

383
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:15,580
and in trade,
you would give us your information.

384
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:18,749
<i>Ridiculous. How do we know
you will not withhold information?</i>

385
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,543
We must trust each other, Tarr.

386
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:24,422
<i>Amusing, human. Trust each other?</i>

387
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:28,843
I propose that we test this relationship

388
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:33,723
by cooperating in a joint exploration
of the planet surface.

389
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:36,142
<i>And what profit is in this,
Picard Captain?</i>

390
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:39,937
The profit, Daimon Tarr,
of saving all our lives.

391
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:43,065
<i>We will agree, no doubt foolishly,</i>

392
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:45,443
<i>but you are warned that
any further trickery on your part</i>

393
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,945
<i>- will be met with no mercy.
- Agreed.</i>

394
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,490
If you join us, we have a well-proven
transporter device--

395
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:53,117
<i>We have a matter-energy device
of our own.</i>

396
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:57,038
<i>We will beam a science team of three
to whatever coordinates you propose.</i>

397
00:24:57,246 --> 00:25:00,124
Excellent, we will transmit
the information shortly.

398
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:01,918
<i>Enterprise out.</i>

399
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:03,461
Hailing frequencies off.

400
00:25:06,506 --> 00:25:10,134
I would log that agreement
as promising, at least.

401
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:12,303
I wonder, captain.

402
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:15,932
I'm not usually one to distrust at first
sight, but this may be an exception.

403
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,935
Especially in view of the fact
that the image he transmitted, sir,

404
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:20,353
was somehow distorted.

405
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:24,398
I sensed the same thing, captain.
He's hiding something.

406
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:26,234
With this power drain, we can't delay.

407
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:28,945
Now, I'd like some additional help,
in case we run into trouble.

408
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,613
- Can you spare Worf?
- Take him.

409
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:34,325
And be careful, Number One.

410
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:48,881
With this power drain,
we may have trouble communicating

411
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,717
- with the Enterprise, sir.
- Understood. Anything else?

412
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:55,179
Due to this force field, there is
presently no way to beam us back, sir.

413
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:58,140
- Oh, you had to ask.
- Understood.

414
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:00,142
Energize.

415
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,008
Tasha? Data?

416
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,969
Geordi?

417
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:37,138
Worf?

418
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:54,655
Anybody?

419
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:08,169
Data?

420
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:19,388
- What are you doing up there?
- Most intriguing, sir.

421
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:22,933
I assume a problem of inaccurately
transmitted program coordinates

422
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:25,936
due to the force field
around the ship, sir.

423
00:27:29,774 --> 00:27:32,902
- Are we alone, sir?
- Unfortunately.

424
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:34,695
Let's find the others.

425
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:42,244
What do you make of these?

426
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:47,041
Crystalline. Mostly inert.

427
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,585
Nothing to write home about.

428
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:51,754
Excuse me?

429
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:53,881
Slang, sir.

430
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:58,052
I did use it correctly, did I not?

431
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:02,682
They've gotta be around
here somewhere.

432
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:13,859
- What's that?
- What?

433
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:15,111
That.

434
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,029
Geordi!

435
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:22,743
Are you conscious?

436
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:25,287
Do I look conscious?

437
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:27,748
- What are you doing?
- I'm resting, sir.

438
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,543
My foot's stuck up there.

439
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,463
I materialized upside-down
above the planet's surface.

440
00:28:34,672 --> 00:28:37,508
Tricorders useless, sir.
Communications gone too.

441
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:40,386
- Fortunately you did not break--
- Data.

442
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:41,721
Mm-hm?

443
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,806
Data, who's that?

444
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:50,229
Who are you?

445
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:16,547
<i>Captain's log, supplemental.</i>

446
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:20,968
<i>It is now six hours since our away team
beamed down to the planet surface.</i>

447
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:24,889
<i>On the Enterprise,
our condition is rapidly worsening.</i>

448
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:27,308
<i>Ordinarily,
with reserve power alone,</i>

449
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:30,394
<i>we could maintain life support
for several months,</i>

450
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:33,939
<i>but the force holding us
has closed down all engines</i>

451
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:37,234
<i>and is draining
our reserve power too.</i>

452
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:39,820
It's getting much, much colder, sir.

453
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:42,072
- How far down is it likely to go?
- A lot.

454
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:45,117
Even in orbital space,
it will get below minus-200 degrees.

455
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:48,370
We won't have to worry much
past minus-70 or so.

456
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:52,374
Feels like that now.
Good, thank you.

457
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:30,538
- If he moves, kill him.
- Letek.

458
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:35,543
Has what we've done broken
our agreement with their captain?

459
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:38,671
We will accuse the humans

460
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:41,423
- of preparing to ambush us.
- Ah.

461
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:46,053
It will be our word against theirs.

462
00:30:46,262 --> 00:30:48,597
And who is more trustworthy,
Mordoc?

463
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,266
Uh...

464
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:53,644
It looks like gold.

465
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:56,689
Tastes like gold.

466
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:58,941
It is gold.

467
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:07,741
Accursed planet!

468
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,660
Nothing compared
to what our captain will do

469
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:12,288
when he finds out you've broken
our landing party agreement.

470
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:18,085
What part of the agreement?
You appeared and attacked us.

471
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:20,921
Are you one of their assassins?

472
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:25,593
I'm Commander William Riker,
first officer of the USS Enterprise.

473
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:28,470
You have a lot to learn.

474
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:37,938
I've got this one!

475
00:31:38,147 --> 00:31:40,357
Careful, commander.
They are much stronger than--

476
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:45,404
- Let me go!
' Pygmy cretins!

477
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:47,865
Let me go!

478
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:50,242
Let me go!

479
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:55,456
- Kill them.
- Hideous monsters.

480
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:57,041
No!

481
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:01,295
Good.

482
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:05,841
You've heard of phasers.
Now, over there.

483
00:32:08,886 --> 00:32:11,889
Is this a female?

484
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:15,059
A human female, Letek?

485
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,603
Hmm, then it is true.

486
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:23,025
You work with your females,
arm them,

487
00:32:23,192 --> 00:32:26,528
and force them to wear clothing.

488
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:30,908
Sickening.

489
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:38,791
I've diverted the reserve power
down here to the family decks.

490
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:41,085
They'll last longest.

491
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:48,342
Is there anything else
we can do, doctor?

492
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:54,181
Where's Wesley?

493
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:57,851
He's in our quarters.

494
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:02,481
- I was tempted to give him a sedative.
- You shouldn't.

495
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:05,359
I know, but he's my son. I love him.

496
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:09,279
He has the right
to meet death awake.

497
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:15,285
Is that a male perspective?

498
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:19,373
Rubbish.

499
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:23,877
Hold it right there.

500
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:27,881
Stop. Stop.

501
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:30,342
- Phasers on stun.
- Already set.

502
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:36,724
What's going on?

503
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,858
What is this?

504
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:53,449
I believe we can deduce
that these crystalline tree shapes

505
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,617
are actually energy collectors.

506
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:59,705
Along the same principle as that which
is draining energy from our ships.

507
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:02,374
But the Ferengi whips were working
when we first arrived.

508
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:04,251
Which means
something new has happened.

509
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:08,213
I'm finally beginning to understand
what my eyes have been showing me.

510
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:11,258
There's patterns of force
everywhere.

511
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:15,345
This entire planet has been turned
into a power accumulator.

512
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,514
- And these?
- Whole point of this place.

513
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:20,559
I can see the planet's power
emanating from--

514
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:23,604
Commander.

515
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:43,207
<i>Be you barbarians?</i>

516
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:44,875
<i>Speak.</i>

517
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:01,892
<i>Who meets the challenge?</i>

518
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:06,688
<i>Who Will it be?</i>

519
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:10,943
Him.

520
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:15,906
<i>You have awakened Portal 63.</i>

521
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:19,368
<i>Do you petition to enter the Empire?</i>

522
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:21,328
Who asks the question?

523
00:35:21,537 --> 00:35:25,666
<i>A guardian of the Tkon Empire.</i>

524
00:35:30,671 --> 00:35:33,215
Biped. Excellent.

525
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:39,763
Why would we petition to enter
an empire that no longer exists?

526
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:42,641
Why do you attempt this deception?

527
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:44,893
The empire is forever.

528
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:48,147
Your empire fell prey to a supernova.

529
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:52,359
We are forever.

530
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:55,654
Data, please repeat the file.

531
00:35:55,863 --> 00:35:59,408
It is a matter of record, Portal,
in the Age of Makto,

532
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,536
the central star
of the Tkon Empire destabilized--

533
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:05,956
There has never been
an Age of Makto.

534
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:08,750
In fact, there have been many ages

535
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:10,586
which have come and passed
since Makto.

536
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:14,673
- This is the Age of Bastu.
- I'm afraid not.

537
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:19,011
According to the Tkon use of
the galactic motionary startime charts,

538
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:23,056
after Bastu came Cimi,
Xora, Makto--

539
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:26,393
Enough. Absurdities.

540
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:30,856
You must have been asleep, Portal,
for hundreds of thousands of our years.

541
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:37,779
Deception is the way of the humans.

542
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:42,910
We Ferengi will gladly
make a petition.

543
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:45,120
We invite your petition.

544
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:46,371
Speak.

545
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:51,710
We wish to offer our services

546
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:57,716
to serve the Tkon Empire
at no profit.

547
00:36:57,925 --> 00:37:01,178
Return control of our starship to us

548
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:07,517
and we will happily destroy
the human criminals

549
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:12,481
and their vessel which attacked us
without provocation.

550
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:15,567
They came to loot your empire.

551
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:20,781
But we intercepted them.

552
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:24,284
You are accused
of deceit and treachery.

553
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:29,122
Do you give yourself up
for judgment?

554
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:30,707
Yes.

555
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:33,835
If you believe these accusations,
then you certainly should act on them.

556
00:37:34,044 --> 00:37:36,630
And there is even more.

557
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:43,804
We can prove that the humans
are destroyers of legal commerce

558
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:50,686
and that they selfishly withhold
vital technology from backward worlds.

559
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:53,772
And necessary
defensive weapons too.

560
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:59,903
We Ferengi now challenge
this human madness.

561
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:03,782
I admit, we've withheld modern
technologies from some worlds.

562
00:38:03,991 --> 00:38:07,369
You see? They are demented,
their values are insane.

563
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:10,372
You cannot believe the business
opportunities they have destroyed.

564
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,583
Proof of their barbarism.

565
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:21,508
They adorn themselves with gold,
a despicable use of a valuable metal.

566
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:28,223
And they shamelessly
clothe their females.

567
00:38:28,432 --> 00:38:34,271
Inviting others to unclothe them,
the very depth of perversion.

568
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:37,024
Paws off, Ferengi.

569
00:38:38,317 --> 00:38:44,614
No female, human or Ferengi,
can order Mordoc around.

570
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:45,824
Submit.

571
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:49,453
Just try it, shorty.

572
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:50,829
At ease, lieutenant.

573
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:57,210
And we still have more faults.

574
00:38:57,419 --> 00:39:01,548
They should add that Starfleet has
permitted several civilizations to fall.

575
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:04,968
We have, at times, allowed the strong
and violent to overcome the weak.

576
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:08,430
They admit their crimes. Hear them.

577
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:11,808
They admit the evil that they do.

578
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:13,060
Barbarian.

579
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:18,148
Yes, you show wisdom.

580
00:39:18,732 --> 00:39:21,234
Barbarians, all.

581
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:23,195
But this one first.

582
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:29,451
In the fashion the Empire
has always challenged savages.

583
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:32,204
No, for battle, come to me!

584
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:34,831
No! That's an order.

585
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,125
You have a single chance for life.

586
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:39,836
One only.

587
00:39:40,087 --> 00:39:43,423
What is the answer
to my challenge?

588
00:39:43,632 --> 00:39:45,926
I offer a thought:

589
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:51,473
"He will triumph who knows
when to fight and when not to fight."

590
00:39:58,105 --> 00:40:00,857
You are being tested, Riker.

591
00:40:01,108 --> 00:40:02,651
What is the answer?

592
00:40:03,402 --> 00:40:04,736
How do you know my name?

593
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,372
Ah.

594
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:19,334
You are facing fate with composure.

595
00:40:19,543 --> 00:40:21,962
But what is the answer
to my challenge?

596
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:29,136
Fear is the true enemy.
The only enemy.

597
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:35,142
Unlike these little ones
who close their minds,

598
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:38,270
your mind holds interesting thoughts.

599
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:43,942
"Know your enemy and know yourself,
and you will always be victorious."

600
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:50,240
Why that thought?
And who is this Sun Tzu you revere?

601
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:56,037
An old Chinese philosopher
from ancient Earth history.

602
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:59,291
You must tell me more of this wisdom,
so much like our own.

603
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:02,043
Gladly, but first our starship.

604
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:04,337
Can you release it?

605
00:41:05,172 --> 00:41:07,424
It is released.

606
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:09,843
All power is restored.

607
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:33,575
Not a moment too soon, Jean.

608
00:41:39,206 --> 00:41:41,374
I mean, captain.

609
00:41:58,558 --> 00:42:02,354
I admit I had my doubts
as your ships battled each other.

610
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:06,399
In overt acts of belligerence, normally
I would have destroyed all of you.

611
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:10,737
And your ships.
But something confused me.

612
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:12,697
Which was?

613
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:15,825
First you wanted
to destroy each other.

614
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:18,203
Then you were willing
to assist each other.

615
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:21,665
What of our vessel?
We knew the same answer.

616
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:26,211
The truth is,
I gave those words to this human.

617
00:42:27,963 --> 00:42:32,092
What of them?
Shall I destroy them?

618
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:34,719
Then they would learn nothing.

619
00:42:34,928 --> 00:42:37,722
A most interesting conclusion.

620
00:42:37,931 --> 00:42:41,601
But what if they never learn, Riker?

621
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:44,688
- Is this a test also?
- Hmm.

622
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:47,732
In life, one is always tested.

623
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:51,570
I see them much as we were
several hundred years ago.

624
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:55,282
But possessing the technology
they now have, they're very dangerous.

625
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:58,410
Untrue.
We seek friendship with you.

626
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:00,745
But we can hardly hate
what we once were.

627
00:43:00,954 --> 00:43:03,873
They may grow and learn.

628
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:05,834
And learn ways to destroy you.

629
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:10,171
Well, our values require us
to face that possibility.

630
00:43:10,714 --> 00:43:14,301
What of you,
with your empire gone?

631
00:43:15,302 --> 00:43:19,347
The universe exists to me
to create life.

632
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:25,478
I shall sleep until needed again.

633
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:49,336
- Compliments, lieutenant.
- Thank you.

634
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:51,296
Lieutenant Worf.

635
00:43:55,592 --> 00:43:59,137
- You've done well.
- Something to write home about.

636
00:44:00,722 --> 00:44:04,142
"Something to write home about"?
Data, that's very human.

637
00:44:04,351 --> 00:44:07,562
The T-9 energy converter has been
beamed aboard and secured, sir.

638
00:44:07,771 --> 00:44:09,022
The Ferengi complained bitterly,

639
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,983
but one final roar from Portal
convinced them.

640
00:44:12,192 --> 00:44:13,902
I commend your performance,
Number One.

641
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,820
One final request, sir.

642
00:44:16,655 --> 00:44:20,075
Permission to beam a box of Data's
Chinese finger puzzles

643
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:23,912
over to the Ferengi,
a thank-you for all they tried to do.

644
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:32,962
Make it so.

645
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:35,882
Set course, La Forge.
