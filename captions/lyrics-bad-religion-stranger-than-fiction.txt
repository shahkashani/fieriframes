Mother, father
Look at your little monster
I'm a hero, I'm a zero
I'm the butt of the worst joke in history

I'm a lock without a key, a city with no door
A prayer without faith, a show without a score
A bad word, a wink, a nod, a shiver
An untold story, sex without purity
A creeping gray memory

I am...
Incomplete, incomplete
Incomplete, incomplete

Doctor, cure me
What is the cause of my condition
This madness shoots me
Like bullets smashing glass in a silent movie

I'm a trap without a spring, a temple with no god
A jack without an ace, the tip of your tongue
I'm a promise, an unmailed letter
An unbuilt motor, deck without a joker
A creeping gray memory

I am...
Incomplete, incomplete
Incomplete, incomplete
Tell Saint Peter not to bet on
Me, yeah
I got a naked obsession
A good intention gone bad

I am...
Incomplete, incomplete
Incomplete, incomplete
Incomplete, incomplete
Incomplete

There are desperate times upon us, there are codes of white and black
Political resentment and people start to crack
There's hate and opposition, there's fumbling dialog
Yet you sit there and judge me and you think it makes a difference

If you think I'm all alone, you are foolishly wrong
There's an entire army who blindly follow along
And you happen to be one of them, believe it or not
Even though you try not to be, we are of the same plague

The other ways we're taught to fear
Don't even scratch the surface of the problem here
But I'm not blind, and I'm not scared
So many crucial factors exist out there
And we're but one, and they're but two
And how we come to terms will help us pull through

Things cannot change too fast, it took us this much time
To reach our current platform and walk this fragile line
If I thought I'd make a difference, I'd kill myself today
But so many are like me, lost in the fray

You create your own reality
And leave mine to me, leave mine to me
Leave mine to me, leave mine to me
A febrile shocking violent smack
And the children are hoping for a heart-attack
Tonight the windows are watching, the streets all conspire
And the lamppost can't stop crying

If I could fly high above the world
Would I see a bunch of living dots spell the word stupidity?
Or would I see hungry lover homicides, loving brother suicides
And olly olly oxen frees who pick a side and hide?

(Woah, oh, oh)
The world is scratching at my door
(Woah, oh, oh)
My morning paper's got the scores
The human interest stories
And the obituary, oh yeah

Cockroach naps, rattling traps
How many devils can you fit upon a match head?
Caringosity killed the Kerouac cat
Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction

In my alley around the corner, here's a wino with feathered shoulders
And a spirit giving head for crack and he'll never want it back
There's a little kid and his family eating crackers like thanksgiving
And a pack of wild desperadoes scornful of living

(Woah, oh, oh)
The world is scratching at my door
(Woah, oh, oh)
My morning paper has the scores
The human interest stories
And the obituary, oh yeah

Cradle for a cat, Wolfe looks back
How many angels can you fit upon a match?
I want to know why Hemingway cracked
Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction

Life is the crummiest book
I ever read, there isn't a hook
Just a lot of cheap shots, pictures to shock
And characters an amateur would never dream up
Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction
The brown and orange sky holds its breath as the sun retreats
To the distant horizon
And our hearts palpitate anxiously as we soon will lay supine
And wait for sleep to overcome us

And from somewhere in our black subconscious minds, when we're asleep
Comes a haunting, swelling mass of voices, resonating
It screams of forgotten victims and the cries of innocence
And the desperate plea for recognition and recompense

Tiny voices
Echoes of our heritage, our long and sallow faces turn the other way
Tiny voices
Harbored deep within as we outwardly deny that they have something to say
And if you don't confront them they will never go away

The billions of tiny pinhole embers fade into a morning sky
Filled with poignant morose wonder
Waking we bear a cosmetic peace that verifies
The turmoil that we carry deep inside
And from somewhere in our black subconscious minds, when we're asleep
Comes a haunting, swelling mass of voices, resonating
It screams of forgotten victims and the cries of innocence
And the desperate plea for recognition and recompense

Tiny voices
Echoes of our heritage, our long and sallow faces turn the other way
Tiny voices
Harbored deep within as we outwardly deny that they have something to say
And if you don't confront them they will never go away

Go away
Go away
Every time you shake someone's hand
And it feels like your best friend
Could it be that it's only superficiality?
Without regard for well-being
Without an inkling of compromise
Handshakes are nothing but a subtle "fuck you"
Contracts determine the best friendships

This is the way of the modern world
Everyone's vying for patronage
This is the way of the modern world
And something's gotta give

Every time you shake someone's hand
And you share neither color or creed
You gotta overcome the obstacles of history
There is restrained passion
Mistrust and bigotry
And these have created the new foundations of society
There's no harmony, just class and race

This is the way of the modern world
Everyone's fighting for dominance
This is the way of the modern world
And something's gotta give

Now I believe in unity
And I am willing to compromise
But I'm not gonna lie or sell my soul
Every time you shake someone's hand
It determines where you stand
And if you won't uphold your side, it's better to...

Fend for yourself, fend for yourself
Fend for yourself, and shun the handshake
Fend for yourself, fend for yourself
Fend for yourself, and shun the handshake
(I believe in unity)
Fend for yourself, fend for yourself
Fend for yourself, and shun the handshake
(And I am willing to compromise)
Fend for yourself, fend for yourself
Fend for yourself, and shun the handshake
(I believe in unity)
Fend for yourself, fend for yourself
Fend for yourself, and shun the handshake
(But I'm not gonna lie or sell my soul)
Fend for yourself, fend for yourself
Fend for yourself, and shun the handshake
Someone's gotta give!
I'm sorry
About the sun
How could I know
That you would burn?
And I'm sorry
About the moon
How could I know
That you'd disapprove?

And I'll never make
The same mistake
The next time I create the universe
I'll make sure we communicate at length
Oh yeah

But until then, better off dead
A smile on the lips and a hole in the head
Better off dead, yeah better than this
Take it away 'cause there's nothing to miss

I'm sorry
About the world
How could I know
You'd take it so bad?

And I'll never make
The same mistake
So if you're looking for a patsy
Why not try the entire human race
Just to play it safe?

But until then, better off dead
A smile on the lips and a hole in the head
Better off dead, yeah better than this
Take it away 'cause there's nothing to miss
Better off dead, you're better off dead
Why don't you try pushing daisies instead?
Better off dead, you're better off dead
A smile on the lips and a hole in the head

And I'll never make
The same mistake
The next time I create the universe
I'll make sure you participate
Oh yeah

And I'll never make the same mistake
The next time I create the universe
I'll make sure you participate
Just in case

Now here I go, hope I don't break down
I won't take anything, I don't need anything
Don't want to exist, I can't persist
Please stop before I do it again

Just talk about nothing
Let's talk about nothing, let's talk about no one
Please talk about no one, someone, anyone!

You and me have a disease
You affect me, you infect me
I'm afflicted, you're addicted
You and me, you and me

I'm on the edge, get against the wall
I'm so distracted, I love to strike you
Here's my confession, you learned your lesson
Stop me before I do it again

Just talk about nothing, let's talk about nothing
Let's talk about no one, please talk about no one, someone, anyone!

You and me have a disease
You affect me, you infect me
I'm afflicted, you're addicted
You and me
You and me

You're clear as a heavy lead curtain
Want to drill you like an ocean
We can work it out, I've been running out
Now I'm running out, don't be mad about it baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

You and me
Have a disease
I want to tie you (You affect me)
Crucify you (You infect me)
Kneel before you (I'm afflicted)
Revile your body (You're addicted)
You and me
Were made in heaven (Have a disease)
I want to take you, (You affect me)
I want to break you (You infect me)
Supplicate you, (I'm afflicted)
With thorny roses (You're addicted)
You and me
Are incurable (Have a disease)
I want to bathe you, (You affect me)
In holy water (You infect me)
I want to kill you, (I'm afflicted)
Upon the altar (You're addicted)
You and me
You and me
Television, television, television, television
Television, television, television, television

Oh yeah, I want to bask in your golden light
Submerge in electric waves, I need my connection
To the world outside

Yeah, the world outside is buzzing like an angry wasp in summer
The candidates are running and the son of God is coming
Crackle mental convolutions tune in to the revolution
Now everyone's included so we never gotta be alone

Television, television, television, television
Television, television, television, television

Oh yeah, I want to bathe in your golden light
Submerge in electric waves, I need my injection
From the world outside

Every atom of my body, blood, sinew, bone and fiber
I can't distill you from my blood, you're like a hungry germ inside of me
You're my lover, my heroine, my conscience, and my voice
And I know now that I have learned to let you in, I will never have to be alone

Television, television, television, television
Television, television, television, television

Oh yeah, I want to bathe in your golden light
Submerge in electric waves

I'd take after my mother but she's from a different generation
I prefer my big brother, he's so gentle and understanding
I learn what I can by the television light
But when I'm alone I know it's gonna be alright
Be alright

Television, television, television, television
Television, television, television, television
Individuals run for cover
For the multitudes of thoughtless clones
Have reached a critical mass
Have reached a critical mass
Individuals hide in fear
Under cover, sheltered by the wafer
Thin veil of intelligence
Thin veil of intelligence

Individuals nowhere to be seen
Ah-ah-ah-ah...

Urbana is oozing
Like a bloated carcass with maggots
Cooking in the desert heat
Cooking in the desert heat
Oozing with progeny writhing
And desperate for input from
Someone more determined
Someone more determined

Congregating in invisible circles
Half a part and half apart
All too aware of the insignificance
Pushing on with soul and heart

Ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah

Individuals don't pray for forgiveness
When pinned up against the wall
Under siege of persecution
Under siege of persecution
Individuals command exception
And accept dichotomy
Maybe you can't choose anymore
Maybe you can't choose anymore

Procreation without gain or purpose (Ah-ah, ah)
Languid wills and torpid minds (Ah-ah, ah)
Catapulted ever faster (Ah-ah, ah)
By the arrow of time (Ah-ah, ah)

You take yours and I'll keep mine (Ah-ah, ah)
Individual!
Well I can see my teenage father standing straight on a desolate corner
In the shadow of tentacled towers by the red light of America
I imagine how his mother felt
When she heard that her husband was dying
And the underground heroes of the tarmac, shooting smack
Were blowing up worlds and damned out loud
Hey, can you tell me, how does it feel?

Yeah, tell me

Can you imagine for a second
Doing anything that you don't have to?
Well, that's what I'm accustomed to
So hooray for me… and fuck you!

When I slept with stony faces on the riverbank
My angel-devil reveler shook me desperately in dying
I don't exactly want to apologize for anything
And now we're all mad and tangled
In secret rooms with Roman candles
On an endless graveyard train

Yeah, tell me

Can you imagine for a second
Doing anything just 'cause you want to?
Well, that's just what I do
So hooray for me… and fuck you!

Yeah, I was dreaming through the "how’s life?" yawning car black in my mind
She told me, "Mad and meaningless as ever..."
And a song came on my radio like a cemetery rhyme
For a million crying corpses in their tragedy
Of respectable existence
Tell me

Can you imagine for a second
Trying half the things you ever wanted to?
Well, that's just what I do
So hooray for me... oh yeah

I'm unrespectable, never sensible
Maybe incredible, so damned irascible, and
I like the things I do
So hooray for me… and fuck you!
So, you're feeling unimportant
'Cause you've got nothing to say
And your life is just a ramble
No one understands you anyway

Well, I got a piece of news son
That might make you change your mind
Your life is historically meaningful
And spans a significant time

Slumber will come soon
And you are helping to put it to sleep
Side by side we do our share, faithfully assuring
That slumber will come soon

Well, now do you feel a little better
Lift up your head and walk away
Knowing we're all in this together
For such a short time anyway

There is just no time to parade around sulking
(Slumber will come soon)
I would rather laugh than cry
(Slumber will come soon)
The rich, the poor, the strong, the weak, we share this place together
(Slumber will come soon)
And we pitch in to help it die
We pitch in to help it die!
I'm not too good at giving morals
And I don't fear the consequence
If life makes you scared and bitter
At least it's not for very long

Slumber will come soon
And you are helping to put it to sleep
Side by side we do our share, faithfully assuring
That slumber will come soon

Slumber will come soon
(Slumber will come soon)
Slumber will come soon
(Slumber will come soon, slumber will come soon)
Slumber will come soon
If I'm a monster, I am a willing one
This roller coaster ride is an enticing one
On the tip of a continuum, flowing wavelike through disorder
Carrying me like a vessel to water

Everything you see leaves a mark on your soul
Everything you feel leaves a mark on your soul
Everything you touch leaves a mark on your soul
Everything you make leaves a mark on your soul

If I can touch it, I can destroy it
If it's imaginable to some degree, I can become it
Like a hungry turning vortex that just flickers to existence
Consuming bits and pieces until I'm finally extinguished

Everyone you see leaves a mark on your soul
Everyone you bare leaves a mark on your soul
Everyone you touch leaves a mark on your soul
Everyone you love leaves a mark on your soul
Oh!
And everything you take leaves a mark on your soul
Everything you give leaves a mark on your soul
And all the fear and loneliness that's impossible to control
And every tear you cry leaves a mark on your soul
Automatons with business suits swinging black boxes
Sequestering the blueprints of daily life
Contented, free of care, they rejoice in morning ritual
As they file like drone ant colonies to their office in the sky

I don't ask questions, don't promote demonstrations
Don't look for new consensus, don't stray from constitution
If I pierce the complexity, I won't find salvation
Just the bald and overt truth of the evil and deception

There is an inner logic
And we're taught to stay far from it
It is simple and elegant
But it's cruel and antithetic
And there's no effort to reveal it

Graduated mentors stroll in marbled brick porticos
In sagacious dialog they despise their average ways
Betraying pomp and discipline, they mold their institution
Where they practice exclusion on the masses every day

I don't ask questions, don't promote demonstrations
Don't look for new consensus, don't stray from constitution
If I pierce the complexity, I won't find salvation
Just the bald and overt truth of the evil and deception

There is an inner logic
And we're taught to stay far from it
It is simple and elegant
But it's cruel and antithetic
And there's no effort to reveal it
Decorated warriors drill harmless kids on pavement
Simulating tyranny under red alert
Protecting the opulent and staging moral standard
They expect redemption of character and self-growth

There is an inner logic
(I don't ask questions, don't promote demonstrations)
And we're taught to stay far from it
(Don't look for new consensus, don't stray from constitution)
It is simple and elegant
(If I pierce the complexity, I won't find salvation)
But it's cruel and antithetic
(Just the bald and overt truth of the evil and deception)

There is an inner logic
(No equality, no opportunity)
And we're taught to stay far from it
(No tolerance for the progressive alternative)
It is simple and elegant
(No equality, no opportunity)
But it's cruel and antithetic
(No tolerance for the progressive alternative)
And there's no effort to reveal it
There's a purpose and there's a goal
There's virtuous and immoral
There's a reason for all of this
But I don't know what it is

I am one and plural, too
I accept them, but they exclude
I could make sense of all of this
But I don't know what it is

The seeds of inspiration never germinated in my mind
The beacon of awakening is somewhere that I can't find
So I don't know what it is
There's a beginning and there's an end
There's a climax, some would contend
There's a way to signify this
But I don't know what it is

The seeds of inspiration never germinated in my mind
The beacon of awakening is somewhere that I can't find
So I don't know what it is

Show me something more definitive
I don't know what it is
I can't believe it
The way you look sometimes
Like a trampled flag on a city street
Oh yeah

And I don't want it
The things you're offering me
Symbolized bar code, quick ID
Oh yeah

'Cause I'm a 21st century digital boy
I don't know how to live but I've got a lot of toys
My daddy's a lazy middle-class intellectual
My mommy's on Valium, so ineffectual
Ain't life a mystery?

I can't explain it
The things you're saying to me
It's going ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
Oh yeah

'Cause I'm a 21st century digital boy
I don't know how to read but I've got a lot of toys
My daddy's a lazy middle-class intellectual
My mommy's on Valium, so ineffectual
Ain't life a mystery?

Tried to tell you about no contro-o-ol
But now I really don't know
And then you told me how bad you had to suffer
Is that really all you have to offer?
'Cause I'm a 21st century digital boy
I don't know how to live but I've got a lot of toys
My daddy's a lazy middle-class intellectual
My mommy's on Valium, so ineffectual

Cat's foot, iron claw (21st century digital boy)
Neurosurgeon, scream for more (21st century digital boy)
Innocence raped with napalm fire (21st century digital boy)
Everything I want, I really need (21st century digital boy)
Ain't life a mystery?
Blood is a river
Flowing darkly amidst the tangled roots of the tall shining city
Crazy flowing man tide migrations
Engorge the big ventricle of heartbroken America
So many heaven hoping, hopeful groping breathers
All tap together quietly and desperately in unison
Hey, hey, hey, is anybody listening?

News from the front
News from the front
We're living in troubled times
So many fighting for their lives
Why do the troops despise the news from the front?

Ignorance is the root of fear
And fear is the kindling of anger
War is the bringer of shame
But never has the burden lain so heavily upon the victim
Rage and desolation, pain and loneliness
Isn't it all alarmingly familiar?
Hey, hey, hey, silence is a killer

News from the front
News from the front
Yeah these are troubled times
How many more will have to die
Before the governors can't deny the news from the front?
Yeah!
Break down the barriers, ally the carriers
What is your motivation?
Take a good look in the mirror

News from the front
News from the front
So many are fighting for their lives
How many more will have to die?
Why does the government decry the news from the front?
You will all say
That I am surely crazy
Only an unrepentant pessimist
Whose thoughts should be detained

But facts are sterile
Not vulgar nor sublime
And they're not religion, they're for everyone
And signify the times

Today is a window
Tomorrow the landscape
All you need to do is take a look outside
To know what we're bound to face

The level of disparity, the common man
The manner of destruction of the native land
The poverty of reprisal from all involved
And the scathing trajectory from the past

Markovian process
Lead us not in vain
Prove to our descendants what we did to them
Then make us go away

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah

There's the image of a man who commands a high opinion
But he hides his hatred with a sheepish grin
And beside him flanking closely are the boisterous hollow masses
Who lap up whatever trickles in

This intercourse of nature, this vulgar social pastime
Reflects the lowest mark of our progress
And the few who ride peripheral maintain subtle advantage
Fighting hard to abstain and redress

Do you know your place in the big charade?
Are you more than they?

Leaders and followers, leaders and followers
Leaders and followers, leaders and followers

Recognition by proximity and a brand new face
Just a smidgen of success pie and a pinch of social grace
You can play with the big boys
Or you can tell them what to do
But sooner or later there's another one like you
The voyeuristic public of which we're all a part
Maintains perspective on the human play
And while many have desires of joining in the show
Many turn and go the other way

Tell me do you know your place in the big parade?
Are you fear and shame?

Leaders and followers, leaders and followers
Leaders and followers, leaders and followers
Leaders and followers, leaders and followers
Leaders and followers, leaders and followers
