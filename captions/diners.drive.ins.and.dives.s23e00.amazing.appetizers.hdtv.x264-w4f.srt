1
00:00:02,136 --> 00:00:03,602
         I'm Guy Fieri,
      and we're rolling out

2
00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:06,405
 looking for America's greatest
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.

3
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:08,107
          This trip...
              Wow!

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,075
   It's a first-course feast.

5
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:12,177
          This is like
     an eclectic funk menu.

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,114
      On this full hour of
       amazing appetizers.

7
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:17,116
  I'm gonna have to go back for
   another round of hot yoga.

8
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:19,218
  We've got tasty Denver tots.

9
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,253
  That's the most tot-alistic.

10
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:23,122
     Smoked Kansas poppers.

11
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:24,623
     Brother, that's wicked.

12
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,492
        And in Oklahoma,
         how about some

13
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:28,460
    good, old Rocky Mountain
            oysters?

14
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:30,129
 You got to be right in my face
      with this, don't you?

15
00:00:30,131 --> 00:00:32,431
  Then we're wrapping cheese in
            Atlanta.

16
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:33,465
     I've never seen it done
            this way.

17
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:35,200
      Stuffing grape leaves
          in Maryland.

18
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:36,535
 Do you put magic in there, too?

19
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,637
    Eating escargot in Miami.

20
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:39,905
  That's pretty well done, huh?

21
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:42,708
And in Queens, atomic fireballs?

22
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,176
 These things are banging, dude.

23
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:46,612
    Plus, all kinds of wings.

24
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:47,946
           Oh, oh, oh!

25
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:50,249
         Made with some
       unexpected things.

26
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:53,485
Probably gonna get kicked out of
 the national wing-eating club.

27
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:55,888
    So, get ready to share...
I can get in trouble with these.

28
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,724
        As we start this
       appetizer-palooza.

29
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:01,493
  Are you guys excited at home?

30
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:03,796
     That's all right here,
           right now,

31
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:05,597
         on "Triple D."

32
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,509
                     ♪

33
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:23,282
           I'm here in
   the Highlands neighborhood,

34
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:25,784
   about a mile from downtown
        Denver, Colorado,

35
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:27,619
     and about a mile away
     from Citizen Pictures,

36
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:30,189
the folks that happen to produce
 "Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives,"

37
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:31,890
   but don't let those details
          confuse you.

38
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:34,460
      I'm here to check out
       a joint that I hear

39
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:36,261
     has the most real-deal,
          off-the-hook,

40
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,130
       outrageous bar food
          you can find.

41
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:40,065
    This is Highland Tavern.

42
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:46,271
   Stupid Burger
   in the window.

43
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:49,074
   Much more upscale than what
 you would consider a local bar.

44
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:50,843
    Not a Philly.

45
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:52,911
  MAN: The attention to having
     higher-end ingredients

46
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:54,480
       in a dive-bar feel.

47
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:01,587
     FIERI: Just when owners
 Brian Sommatino and Andy Stutz

48
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:03,989
           had in mind
when they bought this old joint.

49
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:06,859
       The building we're in is
  an old Coors Brewing building?

50
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:08,760
 Yeah, built in 1901
      by Coors.

51
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:12,631
It's been a bar pretty much
 from 1901 till now,

52
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,199
 minus prohibition.

53
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,938
 So, they kept the suds flowing

54
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,808
   and hired fine-dining chef
          Jeremy McMinn

55
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,510
      to build up the menu.

56
00:02:24,512 --> 00:02:27,412
Every dish has a little
something added to it

57
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:29,081
 that just makes you
    remember it.

58
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:32,184
        Like a pork shank
     braised in ancho chili,

59
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:34,653
           spare ribs
     glazed with Dr Pepper,

60
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,288
     and house-made pastrami

61
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,590
          he's dropping
    on<i> this</i> killer sandwich.

62
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,058
       McMINN:
    Bombshell up.

63
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,261
It is just marvelous.

64
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:44,730
    And if you're looking for
something at the table to share,

65
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:46,698
       they're rocking out
          their version

66
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,066
          of a bar food
           favorite...

67
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:49,301
    Tavern Tots.

68
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:51,637
   ...the homemade tater tot.

69
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,105
     By far, the best things

70
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:54,640
         I've ever found
       in my entire life.

71
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:57,976
                  Do I need
             to freeze-dry them?

72
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,378
                  Do I need
             to dehydrate them?

73
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,679
               What exactly --

74
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,948
Eventually I just gave up
and we made up our own thing.

75
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,716
                 All right.
  Well, let's see how you do it.

76
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,085
  We're gonna cook
    the potatoes.

77
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:09,121
     Cold water.

78
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:12,791
We're gonna bring these up
to just barely a simmer.

79
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:13,792
                    Okay.

80
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,460
    And then even
 the heat out on it,

81
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:16,762
and just let them sit.

82
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:19,131
It usually takes about 40
minutes until they're al dente.

83
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:20,265
           Al dente -- No, okay.

84
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:22,434
Yeah, that's probably
a pretty good description.

85
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:24,203
         So, do you have a timer
                  on this?
    No.

86
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:25,304
                  Awesome.
         No.

87
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:27,673
          So, there's a variable
                    here.
      Yeah.

88
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,242
                 All right.

89
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:32,644
        So, we got our partially
                cooked potato

90
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:36,148
      that's just cooked enough
   that it'll still make shreds.

91
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,783
        Yeah.
             So, hash brown-ish.

92
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:40,152
Hash brown-ish, yeah.
                   There you go.

93
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:45,591
                    Ooh!
        It's like a snow blower.

94
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:47,326
                So, if you're
             a breakfast house,

95
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:51,363
          you would die to have
      hash coming out like that.

96
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:52,764
            A little bit of grit
                   to it,

97
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,234
so it's not completely finished,
   and this is the foundation.

98
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:56,335
     That's it.
                   I love it.

99
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:58,136
         Now what's the process?

100
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:00,205
Then we got to mix in
our dry ingredients.

101
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:01,740
                      Salt?
       Salt.

102
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,242
 Granulated garlic.

103
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:04,610
  Granulated onion.

104
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:06,845
   Cayenne pepper.
                      Nice.

105
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:08,880
        The key is there's a lot
          of nooks and crannies

106
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:09,948
               to all that --

107
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,151
      All those different pieces
                 of potato,

108
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:16,388
             so the more evenly
      you can distribute this...

109
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,290
        Okay.

110
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:20,359
We're gonna add tamari
    to our eggs.

111
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:21,927
                   Really?
         Yeah.

112
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,363
    So, that little bit of egg's
            gonna help bind it.

113
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:25,530
        Yeah.
                 I'm excited.

114
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,566
            Are you guys excited
                  at home?

115
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,335
      Now, we got to form these,
                freeze them,

116
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:31,403
         form them, set them up.

117
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:32,638
      Form them
   and drop them.

118
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,039
               Like it's hot?

119
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:38,176
  They will be hot
once we've dropped them.

120
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:39,478
             Okay. What size tot
                do you make?

121
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,813
 It's about an ounce
   and a quarter.
                         Okay.

122
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,950
              Cook them on 350?
      375.

123
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,551
                       375.
  Till they're GBD.

124
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,687
 That's golden brown
   and delicious.
                  I pick it up.

125
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:51,623
A little salt on these.

126
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,592
    There it is.
Small order of tots.

127
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:55,527
             This is the moment.

128
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,030
     [ Angelic vocalizing ]

129
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:02,267
              Good separation.
            Looking good so far.

130
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:03,902
That's what you're looking for
      in a tot.

131
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:12,277
  Out of all the house-made tots
                 I've had...

132
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,645
              mine included...

133

that's probably one of the best,

00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,326
             of a homemade tot.

145
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:38,303
     I like to think of them

 Everybody knows the bartenders.

 In fact, the place is<i> so</i> local,

 plucked Jeremy from a barstool.

  He was a regular.
He lived about a block away.

155
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:02,094
Came here after work
to have his beer to go home,

156
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:04,229
and I asked him to be the chef
  and he said yes.

00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,998
                That was like

   Yes.

is what you want to use in this?

         This is where the bacon
            has been taken out,

172
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:33,492
              just to give you
              some reference,

in some boiling water.

    like it's skin.

i"Silence of the Lamb"-y for me.

                  through.

   Got four hours
 at a full-on boil.

179

             are these gonna go?

194
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:19,704
          When you dehydrate it
 and take all that moisture out,

195
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,606
         that's what gives them
   the chance to really puff up?

196
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,108
        Yeah.
                    All right.

          a restaurant.

257
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,242
 Now, it didn't look like much.

00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:40,011
   It's here in a strip mall,
      but they had a plan.

259
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,880
        All right, guys.

260
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:44,015
      People would call it
          a sports bar.

261
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,283
You're having the escargot?

262
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:46,451
    And you're serving escargot?

263
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:47,786
Yep.
         It's fabulous.

264
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:50,822
       Mussels Provençal,
      blackened mahi mahi.

265
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,190
     It's got a nice kick to it.

266
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:53,258
       Chicken Francaise.

267
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,260
The seared tuna.
                It's incredible.

268
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,861
    10 wings, Buffalo style.

269
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,430
       Even the bar food's
          over the top.

270
00:09:58,432 --> 00:09:59,631
         Gourmet wings.

271
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:01,399
    It's like chicken piccata
           on a stick.

272
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:03,635
     What you don't expect,
        you'll get here.

273
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:05,737
 I do this food because I worked
     in a French restaurant.

274
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,472
   You got guys in chef coats.

275
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:09,341
       Dude, you're legit.

276
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:12,243
 Chris Hirsh started working in
    the restaurant biz at 14.

277
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:13,278
   Rock and roll.

278
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,013
          Got out at 26
    to go into construction.

279
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:16,748
           You're supposed to be
              ordering a cake.

280
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,150
      Then his wife, Cass,
      won a kind of lottery

281
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:22,387
  the state of Florida runs to
 hand out some liquor licenses.

282
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:25,790
 CASS: So I said, "Look, you can
   build bars, you're a chef."

283
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,259
Had either of you managed or
owned a restaurant before this?
                      No.

284
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:31,363
  But they weren't gonna do it
    the standard way, anyway.

285
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:32,864
       Pickup.

286
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:36,034
   Chris introduced different
     things to these people,

287
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,770
  and they just learned to love
          his cuisine.

288
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:40,438
       What does Chris do?
          I don't know,

289
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,340
   but it's melt in your mouth
           delicious.

290
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:44,109
      Everything is fresh.

291
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:45,677
   Home cooked, from scratch.

292
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,612
WOMAN: Peppercorn dressing.
    FIERI: Makes it himself?

293
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:48,747
 He should bottle it, oh, yeah.

294
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:50,715
        Homemade croutons
      from leftover bread.

295
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:52,050
  Wow, those are good croutons.

296
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,119
  And look at all the different
       sauces being held.

297
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:55,887
   That tartar sauce is legit.

298
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:59,424
     That scampi butter with
        shallots, garlic.

299
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:01,893
    I put my juices in, which is
     white wine and lemon juice.

300
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:03,561
     Mm, it's tasty already.

301
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:04,829
    And they use it all over
           the place.

302
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,398
Pick up, one mussel.

303
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,401
     From mussels Provençal
   to oysters with jalapeños,

304
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:12,370
    lemon juice, and a little
     provolone, to escargot.

305
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:15,106
    Yeah, this is exactly the
process I thought I'd be finding

306
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:16,408
  when I pulled up to Scully's.

307
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,475
     A lot of people pass us by,

308
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:18,743
               don't know what
             they're gonna miss.

309
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,712
I looked at the menu, I said,
"Oh, they have escargot."

310
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:22,247
   You find that at every bar
          joint, right?

311
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:24,449
WOMAN: They serve it to you just
      like you would get it

312
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:25,950
     in a French restaurant.

313
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:27,686
  Hands down, first time we've
  ever seen escargot on a menu.

314
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,354
     But it goes over well?
Fantastic.

315
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:30,922
         People love it?
They love it.

316
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:32,891
Quit talking, let's get into it.
Let's do it, then.

317
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:34,392
    Let's do it.
The pan's hot, already.

318
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:36,394
    6 mushrooms.

319
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:37,595
         Okay, is this new math,
              'cause you got 7.

320
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:39,964
There you go. Put a little oil
     in it first

321
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:42,233
just to get it started.

322
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:45,704
We take Belgian escargot,

323
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:48,339
got a little seasoning with
salt and white pepper.

324
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:50,542
And then as we made earlier,
 our garlic butter.

325
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:52,610
          So, everybody comes to
           temperature together.

326
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:54,379
We're gonna take out
   our mushrooms.

327
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,114
 Take our escargot.

328
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,415
        And this is a big seller
                on the menu?

329
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,651
      Big time.
You come and have that,

330
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:02,253
a couple appetizers,
   make it a meal.

331
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:03,755
               Oh.

332
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:07,892
We're gonna take a little
  provolone cheese.

333
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,628
          Look at that.
   That's pretty well done up.

334
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,498
 Mm, nothing like a little snail
           and cheese.

335
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,368
    I've had so many escargot
       that are so chewy.

336
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,537
      That was so delicate,
         it was like --

337
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,706
       It was like buttah.
            Oh, man.

338
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,641
     What you getting after,
       a little escargot?

339
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:25,677
          Mm. It's good?
      Excellent.

340
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,748
It's rich, very well-cooked,
    very tender.

341
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,816
        Mm. It's so good.

342
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:35,053
    I asked for extra garlic,
         and you get it.

343
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:39,124
   I didn't see where it said
   <i> Le</i> Sports Bar and<i> Le</i> Pub.

344
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:40,759
          [ Laughter ]

345
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,927
 Blackened dolphin.

346
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,230
   Gourmet food in a dark bar.

347
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:46,531
Blue Burger, no fries.

348
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:48,666
 Even their bar food classics...
Chili cheeseburger.

349
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:50,969
  ...are done the Scully's way.
10 wings.

350
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:53,238
     I mean, I've had wings
      many ways to Sunday.

351
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,040
    I have never fried them,
     and then grilled them.

352
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:58,143
 But that's exactly what they're
           doing here.

353
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:00,645
    And what are you having,
       the Oriental Wings?

354
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:01,946
     The Garlic and Buffalo.

355
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,882
         Scampi Wings and sauce.

356
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,750
All with sauce done Chris's way.

357
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,352
10 wings, Buffalo style.

358
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:09,320
   Buffalo wings are hot sauce
           and butter,

359
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:11,256
         and that's it,
     but I'm ready to watch.

360
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:14,526
We're gonna take a gallon of
     hot sauce,

361
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:16,327
half gallon of Worcestershire.

362
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,363
Fresh chopped garlic.
   Whipped butter.

363
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:20,799
Yeah, roasted wings.
They're all fresh wings.

364
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,433
       Like a pterodactyl.
We par-fry 'em.

365
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:24,702
      Put a crunch on 'em.
Yeah.

366
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:26,871
         So you fry 'em,
       then you toss 'em,

367
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:29,274
       then you grill 'em,
       then you toss 'em,

368
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:31,843
       then you grill 'em,
      and then you eat 'em.

369
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:34,946
       I love the handle.
       That's a good wing.

370
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:37,849
It has that smoky under flavor.
     Delicious.

371
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:40,718
I have never tasted any wings
     like this.

372
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,453
            Or this.
                   Scampi wings.

373
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:45,523
Scampi wings, take our smashed
 and crushed garlic,

374
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:46,825
   chopped garlic.

375
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:49,093
             No oil in the pan?
Not yet.

376
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:52,564
        I don't know that
         I've seen this.

377
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:54,332
  Or the sauté with the finger.

378
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,768
Gonna add a little bit of oil.
  Caramelize that.

379
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,970
Now we can start to add
     our butter.

380
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:00,638
     So, you let that slowly
           melt down.

381
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,740
   How are our wings looking?
What do you think?

382
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:05,143
                     Crispy?
  Just grill it up,
give it a little flavor.

383
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,744
         Sauce is ready?
Let's do it, let's do it.

384
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:08,246
     Wow, you can smell 'em.

385
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:10,648
  Parmesan cheese.

386
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,317
   And that's it.

387
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:15,420
Probably gonna get kicked out of
 the national wing-eating club.

388
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:17,055
           Sacrilege.

389
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:19,891
  Mm, I would have just done it
      with regular garlic,

390
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:22,393
       but the kicker was
     the caramelized garlic.

391
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,996
    Some legit food, brother.
          Legit, legit.

392
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:26,297
               It's delicious.

393
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,899
 Got a card special,
    Bleu Burger.

394
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:30,001
I've had everything on the menu.

395
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:31,436
           You're never gonna be
                disappointed.

396
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:34,272
 The thing that makes this place
     work is Chris and Cass,

397
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:35,773
           they're great.
This is awesome.

398
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,076
      People just love it,
      and they keep coming.

399
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:40,411
 FIERI: The joint that's got two
          pool tables,

400
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:42,313
      people would call it
          a sports bar,

401
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:43,781
  and you're serving escargot.

402
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:46,217
             Yep.
                Fantastic, dude.

403
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,386
 Coming up in Queens, New York.

404
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,122
               What up?
   Mac and cheese gone atomic.

405
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:52,857
    All right, this is now --

406
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:55,293
       And an offer that's
         hard to refuse.

407
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:57,395
  Never seen that coming, baby.

408
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,639
  So, I'm right over the bridge
         from Manhattan

409
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:08,640
       in Astoria, Queens.

410
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:10,408
     You remember Astoria --

411
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,144
wan area with a lot of history

412
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:14,879
     and a lot of character,
           this is it.

413
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:17,782
And speaking of characters, wait
 till you check out this joint.

414
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:20,118
    I hear it's off the hook.
     This is Queens Comfort.

415
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,757
Captain Crunch chicken fingers,
      table 11.

416
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:26,958
     It's just mind blowing.

417
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,793
       The Egg Mc'Ruffin.

418
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:30,628
           I love it.
         This is great.

419
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,030
      I mean, it brings you
     back to your childhood.

420
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:33,097
   A little bit of nostalgia.

421
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,166
        It makes you feel
    like you're a kid again.

422
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:37,902
      MAN: All the pictures
 on the wall made you feel like

423
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:39,137
you were at your aunt's house --

424
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,605
    your aunt that could cook
          really good.

425
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,140
     Brisket mac and cheese,
           table six.

426
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:43,608
   The food here is unmatched.

427
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,043
      Donnie makes it work
         fantastically.

428
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:47,245
       This is Donnie D'Alessio.
                 Double "D."

429
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:48,313
  Nice to meet you.

430
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:50,481
                 [ Laughs ]
                  What up?

431
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:54,385
             FIERI:
  A cat from Queens who traded
  in his low-budget film career

432
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:57,355
 to open up this joint in 2011.

433
00:15:57,357 --> 00:16:00,391
    And he's had a "Triple D"
drive-by on his mind ever since.

434
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:01,492
       This is
 my dream come true.

435
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:02,961
                 Seriously?
  Yeah.

436
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,096
        Are you married, Donnie?
Um...

437
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:06,965
                      [ Laughs ]
Okay, I'm not married yet.

438
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,466
I've been in a relationship
   for five years

439
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,002
and I just recently bought
       a ring,

440
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:12,737
but I haven't proposed yet.
                      Very nice.

441
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,539
    Probably 'cause he's had
         his hands full

442
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,407
coming up with the out-of-bounds
             dishes

443
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:18,810
  that keeps this place packed.

444
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,578
    This is like
an eclectic-funk menu.

445
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,815
     Enchiladas and burgers
        and comfort food.

446
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,683
D'ALESSIO:
Chicken and waffles.
    Anything you can imagine.

447
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:28,987
             FIERI:
     Or Donnie can imagine.

448
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,555
             Atomic Fire Balls.

449
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:32,156
    FIERI: Plus, he's making
    the kind of unique food

450
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,225
 that only a kid could dream up.

451
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:36,728
  I got the Atomic Fire Balls.

452
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,696
     It's like homemade mac
 and cheese scooped into a ball.

453
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:44,235
  They're atomic, but they're
  really, really, really good.

454
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:46,637
So, now we're making
the Atomic Fire Balls.

455
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,139
                    Okay.
            All kinds of cheese.

456
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:52,176
We got the Béchamel, here.
This is milk and cream.

457
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,212
                  When are
          you gonna get engaged?

458
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:56,114
         Oh,
a couple years from now.

459
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:58,950
     Man, I wouldn't wait around
     on that one. Okay, we good?

460
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:00,551
   Garlic powder.
                           Okay.

461
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:01,886
Onion powder.      Onion powder.

462
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:03,287
      Cayenne.

463
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:04,689
        Salt.

464
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,290
    Black pepper.

465
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:07,592
      Tabasco.

466
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:08,860
     Texas Pete.

467
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,361
             Wow, this<i> is</i> spicy.

468
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,996
      Sriracha.

469
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:13,865
Shredded yellow cheddar.

470
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,433
   White cheddar.
                           Yeah.

471
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:17,502
Shredded fontina cheese.

472
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:19,070
     All right,
so we're gonna whisk this...

473
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,407
        Okay.
  So, that's that.

474
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:24,909
We're gonna add heavy cream
 and the egg yolks.

475
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,677
            Gonna whisk that in.

476
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:27,745
   Elbow macaroni.

477
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:33,284
Pour it into a hotel pan
   and let it set.

478
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:34,786
           That looks
   like it's gonna be a mess.

479
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:36,554
                  Try this.

480
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,490
     Mmm! That is spicy, though.
                    Whoo!

481
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:43,027
                 Parchment.
               Let it set up.

482
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:45,663
So, now we're gonna make
the egg wash. Eggs, here.

483
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:48,032
      Tabasco.

484
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:49,567
     Texas Pete.

485
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,469
      Sriracha.
 That's ready to go.

486
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:54,572
All right, so, now we have
  our flour, panko.

487
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,474
Now we're gonna make
     the balls.

488
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:58,209
 Scoop the macaroni.

489
00:17:58,211 --> 00:17:59,844
      Form it.

490
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:02,647
      Now you go into the flour,
           into the egg wash...

491
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:05,116
Yeah. Into the panko,
which we also have --

492
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:07,385
                And the panko
            is seasoned with...?
Cayenne.

493
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:08,820
              You deep fry it.

494
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:12,457
                     So,
       they're out of the fryer.

495
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:13,424
You get five per order.

496
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:16,794
This is the garnish.

497
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:18,196
                  Oh, geez.

498
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:19,730
                 All right,
            this is now obscene.

499
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,801
                  Mmm! Aw!

500
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:27,839
      I'm gonna have to go back
  for another round of hot yoga.

501
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:30,875
     [ Laughs ]
                   That's crazy.

502
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:34,278
   Typically, when you have mac
  and cheese balls, they're dry.

503
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,781
       But the fact that you had
        that Béchamel so thick,

504
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,117
        you fried them quickly,
      you made them small enough

505
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,085
           so the heat could get
            all the way through

506
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:42,820
               without cooking
             all the cheese out.

507
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:44,155
                These things
             are bangin', dude.

508
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:46,824
                 Well done.

509
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:47,992
                    Pow!

510
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:49,760
  Fire Balls ready.

511
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:52,864
   It's like my mom's mac and
  cheese but with a kick to it.

512
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:54,999
  Clear your sinuses right up.

513
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:56,767
 It's just a great thing to have
      in the neighborhood.

514
00:18:57,837 --> 00:19:00,938
 Being on this show
has been a dream come true.

515
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,674
  It would also be
a dream come true if...

516
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:06,244
    Jill Sirota,
 will you marry me?

517
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:09,147
         Yes, of course!

518
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:17,421
                 [ Laughs ]
    Engaged today on "Triple D."

519
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:20,057
         Never seen that coming,
                    baby!

520
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:25,096
  Up next on this full hour of
      amazing appetizers...

521
00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:26,464
  I'm telling you.
                      Thank you.

522
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:27,498
     Good eats.

523
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,033
       In Paola, Kansas...

524
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:30,902
        A lot of work for
      a chicken wing, man.

525
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:33,804
...a barbecue joint even smoking
          the starters.

526
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:37,508
   I've had smoked mozzarella,
    but smoked cream cheese?

527
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,477
   And in Vinita, Oklahoma...

528
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:40,912
               Ah!

529
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:42,313
     ...a down home café...

530
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:43,581
    Look at that right there.

531
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:46,884
    ...taking the bull by the
   opposite end of the horns.

532
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:48,686
              Huh?
       Moo, moo, buckaroo.

533
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,027
     about 40 miles south of
          Kansas City.

534
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,296
  Now, a lot of folks think of
     this as cattle country,

535
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:00,498
 but you might change your mind
      after you try some of

536
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,634
        the tasty pork at
         the BBQ Shack.

537
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:04,902
                  Order up!

538
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:07,838
         From whole hogs
        to racks of ribs.

539
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,874
                      Fantastic.
         It's go big...

540
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,843
          Look at that!
  ...or go home at this joint.

541
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:14,345
             Just get into it?
        Yeah.

542
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:15,646
And you can eat the whole thing?

543
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:17,114
           Come back in an hour.
            Order up!

544
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:21,085
  It was a big gamble that paid
 off big for Rick Schoenberger.

545
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:23,621
Got the barbecue blood flowing.
            You barbecue, right.

546
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:27,225
Who left a corporate job to turn
  his hobby into his business.

547
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,360
       Now, he's firing up
      the monster smoker...

548
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:32,430
Figure out what you need and get
the next step bigger.

549
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:35,633
   ...cranking out burnt ends,
        homemade sausage,

550
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:38,402
   and even loading the smoker
       with chicken wings.

551
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,271
That's a mess of wings.
          They're good.

552
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:42,006
 They're the best chicken wings
             around.

553
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:45,409
   Most people just take 'em,
       fry 'em, sauce 'em,

554
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,478
  but you're gonna season 'em,
           smoke 'em,

555
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,813
   and then fry 'em to order.

556
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:50,014
Then we deep fry them to order.

557
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:53,384
We'll just take some of this
rub, dump it right on.

558
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:55,553
           And a little of this?
 Now, this is the secret kicker?

559
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:57,989
Throw some of them peppers
   in there, too.

560
00:20:57,991 --> 00:21:00,658
   Dried chipotles, 'cause these
    are dried, smoked jalapeños.

561
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,827
   Put a nice little kick on it.

562
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:04,262
   How long do these go on the
           smoker for?

563
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:06,097
Probably a couple hours.

564
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:09,884
       Really? A lot of work for
            a chicken wing, man.

565
00:21:09,886 --> 00:21:12,820
t iteytake --
Oh, maybe a minute.ours.

566
00:21:12,822 --> 00:21:14,021
Looks like they're ready.

567
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,856
    All that seasoning still
            stays on?

568
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,258
                    Yeah.

569
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,560
  Yeah, it's cooked into 'em out
            there on the smoker.

570
00:21:21,497 --> 00:21:23,364
       You get that smoke
       right off the bat.

571
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:24,732
                   Yeah.
Wow, this is good.

572
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:26,534
Good stuff, brother,
  I'm telling you.

573
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:29,570
                  Thank you.
Good eats.

574
00:21:29,572 --> 00:21:31,539
   I think it's the best place
        in Paola to eat.

575
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,708
  Just real friendly, just that
       kind of atmosphere.

576
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,911
  FIERI: And the kind of place
       where the smoker's

577
00:21:36,913 --> 00:21:40,614
 always smoking with everything
    from whole hog to ribs...

578
00:21:40,616 --> 00:21:42,316
                      Fantastic.
        ...to brisket...

579
00:21:42,318 --> 00:21:45,453
It's real tender.
  ...and now jalapeño poppers --

580
00:21:45,455 --> 00:21:46,587
     the way they were done

581
00:21:46,589 --> 00:21:48,589
before the chain restaurants got
         a hold of 'em.

582
00:21:48,591 --> 00:21:50,257
    Where do all the peppers
           come from?

583
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:52,159
These particular ones
I grew in my garden.

584
00:21:52,161 --> 00:21:57,698
We actually just core the seeds,
the insides of the jalapeño.

585
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,367
  Okay, so you take the top off.

586
00:21:59,369 --> 00:22:01,836
Yeah, core the jalapeños
with the chili twister.

587
00:22:01,838 --> 00:22:04,505
         Now, tell me about this
             cream cheese thing.

588
00:22:04,507 --> 00:22:09,076
Okay. Take just your standard
    cream cheese

589
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:12,179
and just squeeze a little bit
into each one of them peppers.

590
00:22:12,181 --> 00:22:15,049
                    That enough?
Yeah, that's probably good.

591
00:22:15,051 --> 00:22:16,584
We'll take it a step further.

592
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:20,254
I use a water chestnut
 marinated overnight

593
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:24,058
in a little brown sugar
 and some soy sauce.

594
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,794
I have seen some funny things to
            stuff a pepper with,

595
00:22:26,796 --> 00:22:29,430
but this might be the top of it,
              a water chestnut.

596
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:33,034
      And then some more cheese?

597
00:22:33,036 --> 00:22:35,736
All right, now we're ready
   for the baking.

598
00:22:35,738 --> 00:22:38,005
   Try to get your beginning and
   end to meet in the same spot?

599
00:22:38,007 --> 00:22:39,340
That'd be a good thing.

600
00:22:39,342 --> 00:22:41,108
       And then go right through
                 the center.

601
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,077
    And now we're gonna sprinkle
               the dry rub --

602
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,545
          the universal dry rub?

603
00:22:44,547 --> 00:22:48,049
Just a little bit, kind of use
   it like paprika

604
00:22:48,051 --> 00:22:49,717
  to give a little
  nice appearance.

605
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:51,452
   Just dust it, add some color.
Yeah.

606
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:54,155
Now these go in the barbecue.
       Yep, right on the smoker.

607
00:22:56,392 --> 00:22:59,660
   Look at those.

608
00:22:59,662 --> 00:23:01,695
Those are like mondo popper.

609
00:23:01,697 --> 00:23:05,099
      I've had smoked brie,

610
00:23:05,101 --> 00:23:08,636
   I've had smoked mozzarella,
    but smoked cream cheese?

611
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,908
    Those are fresh peppers.

612
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,177
   Brother, that's wicked hot.

613
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:17,611
                         It is.
          Great flavor.

614
00:23:17,613 --> 00:23:19,313
         Like everything
       Rick's rolling out.

615
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,115
Just really good, really good.

616
00:23:21,117 --> 00:23:23,184
   He really is the real deal.

617
00:23:23,186 --> 00:23:27,988
       The rub, the smoke,
     all done low and slow.

618
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,790
   And it's the same every time,
                 wonderful.

619
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,426
            I've had everything.
You've run the menu?

620
00:23:32,428 --> 00:23:33,994
              I eat here a lot.

621
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:35,529
   Out goes the old theory of

622
00:23:35,531 --> 00:23:37,631
          cooking them
      cools them down, huh?

623
00:23:37,633 --> 00:23:40,468
                   That's right.
 Seasoned peppers are hot. Wow!

624
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,236
  Welcome to Vinita, Oklahoma,

625
00:23:42,238 --> 00:23:44,472
about an hour northeast of Tulsa
       in cattle country.

626
00:23:44,474 --> 00:23:46,474
  Now, we're heading to a place
        called Clantons,

627
00:23:46,476 --> 00:23:49,009
      a family-owned joint
       for over 80 years.

628
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,845
        Famous for their
      chicken-fried steak,

629
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:52,580
           and another
     cattle country delicacy

630
00:23:52,582 --> 00:23:54,648
   you just got to check out.

631
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:55,850
      Ever had calf fries?

632
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:57,118
     I've not had any calf fries

633
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,053
   anywhere else in a restaurant
                 like these.

634
00:23:59,055 --> 00:24:00,888
    Cat fries?
                      Calf.

635
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:03,224
     Some places know 'em as
     Rocky Mountain oysters.

636
00:24:03,226 --> 00:24:05,025
  Others don't know 'em at all.

637
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:07,194
  They come from the underside
          of the calf.

638
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:08,362
         Mm.

639
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,097
    They say -- when you're a
      first-time customer,

640
00:24:10,099 --> 00:24:11,432
   they send out a free order.

641
00:24:11,434 --> 00:24:14,068
  They're a classic here, along
    with chicken-fried steak.

642
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,903
   And they do use
the good seasonings.

643
00:24:15,905 --> 00:24:17,138
    And chicken and dressing.

644
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,572
It's just like my mom
  would have made.

645
00:24:18,574 --> 00:24:22,843
      Country favorites --
      and a local favorite.

646
00:24:22,845 --> 00:24:25,579
       In the same family
      for four generations,

647
00:24:25,581 --> 00:24:28,149
    starting with a guy named
          Sweet Tater.

648
00:24:28,151 --> 00:24:29,717
    WOMAN: My great-grandfather.
Sweet Tater.

649
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:31,785
                    Sweet Tater.
    'Cause he was
a sweet potato farmer.

650
00:24:31,787 --> 00:24:33,187
   Wasn't making a living at it.

651
00:24:33,189 --> 00:24:35,422
So, he said he was gonna
open up his own restaurant.

652
00:24:35,424 --> 00:24:37,124
       And 80 years later,
         Dennis Patrick

653
00:24:37,126 --> 00:24:39,093
    and his wife, Melissa --
       she's a Clanton --

654
00:24:39,095 --> 00:24:40,394
     are keeping it rolling.

655
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:41,762
Chicken-fried chicken ready?

656
00:24:41,764 --> 00:24:44,031
         They took over
      almost ten years ago

657
00:24:44,033 --> 00:24:46,066
         when Melissa's
        parents retired.

658
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:48,469
  MELISSA: We were both pretty
  busy in the corporate world,

659
00:24:48,471 --> 00:24:50,504
 and our kids were getting into
        high-school age,

660
00:24:50,506 --> 00:24:53,340
   junior high age, and we said,
            "We're coming back."

661
00:24:53,342 --> 00:24:54,708
        Nice.

662
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,043
        Iced tea, got it.

663
00:24:56,045 --> 00:24:58,212
      Real friendly people,
           great food.

664
00:24:58,214 --> 00:25:00,181
 It's just a nice, homey place.

665
00:25:00,183 --> 00:25:02,483
FIERI: A homey place where their
       home cooking knows

666
00:25:02,485 --> 00:25:04,251
      homemade calf fries.

667
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:06,654
  DENNIS: The governor and his
       wife come in here.

668
00:25:06,656 --> 00:25:08,155
         She loves 'em.

669
00:25:08,157 --> 00:25:10,824
    FIERI: "You have the best
    calf fries in Oklahoma"?

670
00:25:10,826 --> 00:25:13,594
That is the first lady of
Oklahoma telling you that.

671
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:17,431
 Here we have Oklahoma's finest
           calf fries.

672
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,567
FIERI: Where does one
   harvest these?

673
00:25:19,569 --> 00:25:22,570
  From the underside of a calf,
            actually.

674
00:25:22,572 --> 00:25:23,871
        Agh!

675
00:25:23,873 --> 00:25:25,573
Yeah, the batter's gonna matter.

676
00:25:25,575 --> 00:25:27,308
                Chicken base,
               ground mustard,

677
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,176
        a little salt and pepper
                  in here.

678
00:25:29,178 --> 00:25:30,778
        Just pour that in there.
The whole thing?

679
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,047
                    Yes, sir.
It's chunky.

680
00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:34,481
          Well, it's buttermilk.

681
00:25:34,483 --> 00:25:36,817
        With a cornmeal,
      cayenne flour dredge.

682
00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:38,586
Cayenne, kill it, kill it.

683
00:25:38,588 --> 00:25:40,487
            Now we just dump 'em
             in the deep fryer.

684
00:25:40,489 --> 00:25:42,656
See, they didn't even scream.

685
00:25:42,658 --> 00:25:44,625
           [ Laughs ]

686
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:46,860
 You got to be right in my face
      with this, don't you?

687
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,435
            Not bad.
        Not really good.

688
00:25:54,437 --> 00:25:56,904
       Got any hot sauce?

689
00:25:56,906 --> 00:25:58,505
Digging it with the blue cheese.

690
00:25:58,507 --> 00:26:03,777
    Chicken-fried calf fries,
       Buffalo wing style.

691
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:05,246
        Hot.

692
00:26:05,248 --> 00:26:06,547
         That was good.

693
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:08,616
    I don't know that I like
        the big ones yet.

694
00:26:08,618 --> 00:26:10,217
    Look at that right there.
              Huh?

695
00:26:10,219 --> 00:26:12,086
       Moo moo, buckaroo.

696
00:26:12,088 --> 00:26:13,821
Calf fries, you need ketchup
  with those fries?

697
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:16,624
     Do they ever do, like,
       calf fries ceviche

698
00:26:16,626 --> 00:26:18,892
          or calf fries
       on the half shell?

699
00:26:18,894 --> 00:26:20,194
          [ Laughter ]

700
00:26:20,196 --> 00:26:21,762
How did you like the calf fries?

701
00:26:21,764 --> 00:26:23,697
 We were anxious to see how you
           liked them.

702
00:26:23,699 --> 00:26:26,233
They were very unique.
     I like smaller ones better.

703
00:26:26,235 --> 00:26:28,469
I did -- a couple that I had
   were very big.

704
00:26:28,471 --> 00:26:30,804
 Were very, like --
the whole family was there.

705
00:26:30,806 --> 00:26:32,106
          [ Laughter ]

706
00:26:32,108 --> 00:26:35,909
  We pride ourselves on carrying
             over the tradition

707
00:26:35,911 --> 00:26:38,379
           that started actually
                80 years ago.

708
00:26:38,381 --> 00:26:40,047
       FIERI: And not just
        the calf fries --

709
00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:41,615
   they're keeping everything
            classic.

710
00:26:41,617 --> 00:26:43,050
               Two iced teas.

711
00:26:43,052 --> 00:26:45,586
  With down home favorites like
         fried catfish,

712
00:26:45,588 --> 00:26:48,055
       homemade apple pie,
     and Clanton's legendary

713
00:26:48,057 --> 00:26:49,490
      chicken and dressing.

714
00:26:49,492 --> 00:26:51,392
   How you doing?

715
00:26:51,394 --> 00:26:53,227
        And for the folks
       in this small town,

716
00:26:53,229 --> 00:26:55,262
   Clanton's has been kind of
         an extension of

717
00:26:55,264 --> 00:26:57,665
      their own dining room
  as far back as they remember.

718
00:26:57,667 --> 00:26:59,066
              Appreciate y'all
                 coming in.

719
00:26:59,068 --> 00:27:02,303
Everybody kind of gets together,
and they know one another.

720
00:27:02,305 --> 00:27:03,704
     It's nice.

721
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:05,572
      It's like sitting at
          mama's table.

722
00:27:05,574 --> 00:27:06,774
Is it, really?
              Yes.

723
00:27:06,776 --> 00:27:10,811
     Every day, every dish,
    for everyone of 80 years.

724
00:27:10,813 --> 00:27:13,247
         Like you'd get at home.
Just a real savory taste.

725
00:27:13,249 --> 00:27:14,715
       A few more minutes.

726
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:17,484
    I've ate here ever since
    I've been 6, 7 years old,

727
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:19,153
 that's where I've always come.

728
00:27:19,155 --> 00:27:20,921
                 Thank you.
              Have a good day.

729
00:27:20,923 --> 00:27:23,023
Your order of calf fries are
coming out right now.

730
00:27:23,025 --> 00:27:24,625
                      Oh, super.
       How many you have?

731
00:27:24,627 --> 00:27:26,760
       You got to evolve.
   People are always changing,

732
00:27:26,762 --> 00:27:28,595
       except they'll say,
       "Hey, that's great.

733
00:27:28,597 --> 00:27:30,998
   Let's try that on the menu.
    Let's put something fancy

734
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,334
   on that, but I'm gonna eat
    my chicken-fried steak."

735
00:27:33,336 --> 00:27:34,968
You get emotional about this?

736
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:37,538
                    I do.
             I love this place.

737
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,406
Coming up in Atlanta, Georgia...

738
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:40,507
       Gosh, that's good.

739
00:27:40,509 --> 00:27:42,009
 ...we're bellying up the bar...

740
00:27:42,011 --> 00:27:44,578
appetizer menu you
       Gwouldn't expect..

741
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,113
         Jerk chili?
                Yeah.

742
00:27:52,054 --> 00:27:53,687
You know, finding great bar food

743
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:56,523
 is way more than just a menu --
    it's a whole experience,

744
00:27:56,525 --> 00:27:59,159
     like here in Atlanta at
   this joint, The Highlander.

745
00:27:59,161 --> 00:28:01,195
It's a dive bar in a strip mall.

746
00:28:01,197 --> 00:28:02,763
 Now, they're heavy on tattoos,

747
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:06,066
        but serious about
        scratch cooking.

748
00:28:06,068 --> 00:28:07,668
              Cheers!
                   Cheers!

749
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,236
  Everybody here is
   really twisted.

750
00:28:09,238 --> 00:28:10,804
       Who's got the chili
          and fritters?

751
00:28:10,806 --> 00:28:12,906
The food here is so much better
than it needs to be.

752
00:28:12,908 --> 00:28:14,608
    MAN: Look at the menu --
          oxtail soup.

753
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,243
           You see that on every
               drive through.

754
00:28:16,245 --> 00:28:18,112
          It's awesome bar food.
It's very fresh.

755
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:20,147
  Wow, you got it going on with
           this, man.

756
00:28:20,149 --> 00:28:21,849
                      Excellent.
It's a neighborhood place.

757
00:28:21,851 --> 00:28:24,218
   FIERI: Has been since '92...
You want a cider, right?

758
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,719
   when Jeff Merback and some
      buddies took a chance

759
00:28:25,721 --> 00:28:28,138
 and opened up in a strip mall.

760
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,373
Anrear   16 years later.

761
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,641
That's your brand, right? mall.

762
00:28:30,643 --> 00:28:32,376
      Like being the place
        that's still open

763
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:33,577
   at the end of a long night.

764
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:35,579
More Jaegers, absolutely.

765
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:38,982
 We knew our clientele was gonna
     be bartenders, waiters,

766
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:41,902
    waitresses, cooks, and I
       couldn't throw out

767
00:28:41,904 --> 00:28:45,072
          Ibrahim Garba Jahumpa.

768
00:28:45,074 --> 00:28:46,940
  Oh, so let's just
    go with Ice.

769
00:28:46,942 --> 00:28:48,776
                 Ice, yeah.
       French dip, there you go.

770
00:28:48,778 --> 00:28:50,978
When he became our kitchen
 manager, he brought

771
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,846
   his personality
to our special board.

772
00:28:52,848 --> 00:28:54,581
     Every day, something's
           different.

773
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:55,883
They have a lot of things here

774
00:28:55,885 --> 00:28:57,851
that a lot of places
in Atlanta don't have.

775
00:28:57,853 --> 00:29:00,287
This week, our specialty is
oxtail soup and curried goat.

776
00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:02,589
   I'd walk right by here and
   think, "Mm, curried goat."

777
00:29:02,591 --> 00:29:06,427
And for a starter, there's a cup
      of this with a twist.

778
00:29:06,429 --> 00:29:08,295
       Jerk chili?
              Yeah.

779
00:29:08,297 --> 00:29:10,030
     It's the best bowl of chili
                  in town.

780
00:29:10,032 --> 00:29:11,331
 What makes it jerk?

781
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,133
 There's a jerk marinade that we
                 add to it.

782
00:29:13,135 --> 00:29:14,701
I mean, just because you're
 cooking it with me

783
00:29:14,703 --> 00:29:16,370
doesn't make it jerk, right?
        No, no, no, ground beef.

784
00:29:16,372 --> 00:29:19,740
80/20?
Yeah, and spicy Italian sausage.

785
00:29:19,742 --> 00:29:21,241
          So, this cooks to nice
                 and brown.

786
00:29:21,243 --> 00:29:22,843
            Onions, yellow, red.

787
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:24,611
     Yellow peppers, red pepper,
                green pepper.

788
00:29:24,613 --> 00:29:25,813
 I like the colors.

789
00:29:25,815 --> 00:29:27,047
    Now we add the kidney beans,

790
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:28,682
                black beans,
          and the peeled tomato.

791
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:29,783
       No garlic, though?

792
00:29:29,785 --> 00:29:31,185
The garlic is coming
    in a second.

793
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:32,453
  All right, just making sure.

794
00:29:32,455 --> 00:29:34,588
This looks like about the entire
         spice counter.

795
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,990
  So, that is the veggie base.

796
00:29:36,992 --> 00:29:38,625
               Chicken stock.
The habaneros?

797
00:29:38,627 --> 00:29:40,160
                 Habaneros.
               Roasted garlic.

00:29:40,162 --> 00:29:42,396
Oh, I like that call.
Your jerk seasoning?

799
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:44,097
   Can I taste it?
   Not too spicy.

800
00:29:44,099 --> 00:29:45,532
       Spiced rum, tomato paste.

801
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:48,836
    We just gonna mix everything
               that's in here.

That's nice.

 Put that in my bag.

This goes in our cauldron of
 beans and peppers.

808
00:30:01,617 --> 00:30:02,816
            Want me to scrape?
              Sure.

809
00:30:02,818 --> 00:30:04,451
       I mean, if we're gonna be
                 same team.

810
00:30:04,453 --> 00:30:08,589
Brown sugar, black pepper,
thyme, onion powder, mustard.

811

     Dry mustard, garlic powder,
                  bay leaf.

812
00:30:10,793 --> 00:30:14,061
    Right, color.

 Cilantro.
            Cilantro.

814
00:30:15,764 --> 00:30:18,232
          Okay, red chili flake,
                celery seed.

815
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:19,666
                The allspice.
      So, there's your Jamaican.

00:30:19,668 --> 00:30:20,868
          A little white pepper.

817
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,836
      White pepper, cumin,
          chili powder.

818
00:30:22,838 --> 00:30:24,271
  Round it out with the cayenne.

819
00:30:24,273 --> 00:30:26,073
        Wow. So, now how long we
      gonna let that simmer for?

820
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:27,574
   A couple hours.

821
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:30,177
             Big chunks of meat,
       still see all the colors.

822
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:31,879
       Gosh, that's good.

823
00:30:31,881 --> 00:30:33,313
 That's got a little heat to it.

824
00:30:33,315 --> 00:30:35,215
    Great spice, great color,
         great textures.

825
00:30:35,217 --> 00:30:36,383
       That's good chili.

826
00:30:36,385 --> 00:30:38,685
    Dude, is the chili legit?
Outstanding.

827
00:30:38,687 --> 00:30:40,521
                 It's meaty,
             lots of nice spice.

828
00:30:40,523 --> 00:30:41,755
Crazy dependable food.

00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,323
     Crazy dependable food.

830
00:30:43,325 --> 00:30:44,558
             There's some chips,
               ready to roll.

831
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,160
  The fish specials
 are always amazing.

832
00:30:47,162 --> 00:30:50,330
There's a wonderful caprese
salad that I really dig.

833
00:30:50,332 --> 00:30:53,534
Marinated lime chicken, it's got
really refreshing lime marinade.

834
00:30:53,536 --> 00:30:55,369
Mussels, the corn fritters.

835
00:30:55,371 --> 00:30:57,271
               Those are huge.
    They're like golf ball size.

        The Highlander's

  roasted red pepper remoulade.

838
00:31:01,076 --> 00:31:03,577
   I like the remoulade sauce
   'cause I'm from Louisiana.

839
00:31:03,579 --> 00:31:04,912
             Mm, I like it, man.

840
00:31:04,914 --> 00:31:07,447
     I got to make myself a note
             on that remoulade.

841
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:09,249
    It's spicy and delicious.

Potato skins are up.

00:31:12,655 --> 00:31:14,955
      Like everything here.
Turkey sandwich with a salad.

845
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:17,524
 FIERI: 'Cause a lot of folks'll
      tell you that this is

     their first choice for
   eating out and hanging out.

847
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:21,929
Who's dry?
            This food is nothing

848
00:31:21,931 --> 00:31:23,931
if you don't have the atmosphere
               going with it.

849
00:31:23,933 --> 00:31:25,566
             Jaeger?
   All night, coming right up.

850
00:31:25,568 --> 00:31:27,234
     From mohawks just down
           to yuppies.

851
00:31:27,236 --> 00:31:30,237
   It is the epitome of where
 you're allowed to be yourself.

852
00:31:30,239 --> 00:31:31,772
Everybody's welcome here.

853

     It's a twisted Cheers.

854

                Ally's on it.

855
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,610
People would come here to drink,
             anyway,

856
00:31:36,612 --> 00:31:38,645
   and you get a great menu of
       food on top of it.

   FIERI: Even the bar basics.

 With that Jamaican jerk chili.

860
00:31:43,052 --> 00:31:44,918
  Tonight, I'm eating the loaded
                potato skins.

861
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,620
  Mini burgers they're calling
            sliders.

862
00:31:46,622 --> 00:31:48,522
 Chicken quesadilla,
    I love them.

863
00:31:48,524 --> 00:31:51,224
    Spicy buffalo or Jamaican
       jerk chicken wings.

864
00:31:51,226 --> 00:31:53,060
         MAN: Bar food,
     you don't expect much,

865
00:31:53,062 --> 00:31:55,228
 but here, they give you it made
          from scratch.

866
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:57,664
   FIERI: Even the bar staple
        mozzarella stick.

867
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,800
  Here, it's wrapped in pasta.

868
00:31:59,802 --> 00:32:02,269
 They're much better than normal
             mozzarella sticks.

869
00:32:02,271 --> 00:32:04,838
           It just adds a little
          something extra to it.

870
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,441
I'm gonna make an egg wash, egg
yolk, a little bit of water.

871
00:32:07,443 --> 00:32:08,542
   Whoa, whoa, whoa, just yolks?

872
00:32:08,544 --> 00:32:09,910
         I've never seen it done
                  this way.

873
00:32:09,912 --> 00:32:11,845
I've never seen it done this way
 until I came here.

874
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,747
            Until you came here.
This is the breading.

875
00:32:13,749 --> 00:32:15,682
We're going to add Italian
  seasoning to it.

876
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:18,185
Sheeted egg pasta, brush it with
   a little bit of the egg wash.

877
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:20,487
Just like that.
   That's it, just one rollover.

878
00:32:20,489 --> 00:32:22,189
Yeah. Yeah, now we're gonna
  dip it in the --

00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:24,424
                 Wash again.
       And then the bread crumb.

880
00:32:24,426 --> 00:32:26,493
                I like this.
        Now we're gonna fry 'em?

881
00:32:26,495 --> 00:32:28,261
  So, does the pasta get crunchy
               on the outside?

882
00:32:28,263 --> 00:32:29,296
               Yes.
Oh.

883
00:32:29,298 --> 00:32:30,597
What are we gonna serve
     with these?

884
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:31,932
             The marinara sauce.
Marinara sauce.

885
00:32:31,934 --> 00:32:34,501
    Scratch made with roasted
         garlic, onions,

886
00:32:34,503 --> 00:32:36,903
    peppers, red wine, herbs,
           and spices.

887
00:32:36,905 --> 00:32:38,372
      Wow, those look good!

888
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:40,641
              Wow.

889
00:32:40,643 --> 00:32:43,143
         I'm impressed.

890
00:32:43,145 --> 00:32:44,478
       That's great, man.

891
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,279
  The sheet around it makes it
         hold together,

892
00:32:46,281 --> 00:32:48,148
   gives it a nice texture --
       that's tasty, man.

893
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:50,350
    Those are bananas.
            These are delicious.

894
00:32:50,352 --> 00:32:52,052
              MAN:
    Everyone loves this food.

895
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:55,355
  He is as good for this place
          as any of us.

896
00:32:55,357 --> 00:32:57,758
   Atlanta has better bar food
     than any city deserves,

897
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,960
  and The Highlander is one of
        the best in town.

898
00:32:59,962 --> 00:33:02,562
You come here, and it's just

    FIERI: Whatever the hour.

00:33:03,966 --> 00:33:05,866
 Roll in, hang out,
    have a blast.

901
00:33:05,868 --> 00:33:06,900
You got food coming.

902
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:08,335
   It's supposed to be a bar,

903
00:33:08,337 --> 00:33:09,603
     but it's not bar food.

904
00:33:09,605 --> 00:33:10,871
Southern comfort food,
    all the way.

905
00:33:10,873 --> 00:33:13,473
      You still like each other?
   Oh, yeah.

906
00:33:13,475 --> 00:33:15,075
Anybody got a Highlander tattoo?

907
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:17,511
Not one I can show you.

     In Dundalk, Maryland...

911
00:33:21,283 --> 00:33:23,517
   You are the quintessential
           diner dude.

912
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,819
        Real deal Greek.

913
00:33:25,821 --> 00:33:26,887
         That is killer.

914
00:33:26,889 --> 00:33:28,689
   Just like Yia Yia made it.

915
00:33:28,691 --> 00:33:31,091
  Your Yia Yia should be very,
    very impressed with that.

916
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:32,893
  And in Belmar, New Jersey...

917
00:33:32,895 --> 00:33:35,629

       These are rockin'.
 ...getting a Mexican makeover.

00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:40,801
  Got to come try these wings.

921
00:33:45,507 --> 00:33:47,207
 You know, I think we've figured
         it out by now.

922
00:33:47,209 --> 00:33:49,276
   Some of the greatest diners
    we've seen on "Triple D"

923
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:51,311
  are owned by Greek families.

924
00:33:51,313 --> 00:33:54,448
    I mean, it's the passion
  for food, the strong family,

925
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,116
    and fueled by tradition.

926
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:57,451
  And this one's no different.

927
00:33:57,453 --> 00:33:59,152
     Here we are in Dundalk,
            Maryland,

928
00:33:59,154 --> 00:34:01,922
  right outside of Baltimore --
  this is the Boulevard Dinner.

929
00:34:01,924 --> 00:34:05,425
   Spinach Pie up.
Brown gravy on that.

930
00:34:05,427 --> 00:34:07,094
   It's like a landmark here.

931
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,531
This is the go-to joint.
                       Oh, yeah.

00:39:00,722 --> 00:39:02,822
Went for a job one day, and I've
 been in the kitchen ever since.

1068
00:39:02,824 --> 00:39:04,491
        And after decades
          in the biz...

1069
00:39:04,493 --> 00:39:06,793
Tequila lime shrimp.
   ...he brought his own take

1070
00:39:06,795 --> 00:39:09,362
   on Mexican home to Jersey.
Amazing.

1071
00:39:09,364 --> 00:39:11,097
 You can't get any Mexican like
        this around here.

1072
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,099
       I just like to let people
             experiment with new

1073
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:14,234
          and different flavors.

1074
00:39:14,236 --> 00:39:16,102
   FIERI: Like a Mexican spin
        on chicken wings.

1075
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:18,104
                Adobo wings.
          I've never made Adobo.

1076
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:19,539
         And that gets tossed on
                 the wings?

1077
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:22,308
That gets tossed on the wings.

1078
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:25,712
The Adobo sauce is outrageous.

1079
00:39:25,714 --> 00:39:27,280
                    Adobo wings.
           I love 'em.

1080
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:28,882
  We're gonna make Adobo sauce.

1081
00:39:28,884 --> 00:39:30,884
             Adobo being the red
                tomato sauce,

1082
00:39:30,886 --> 00:39:33,486
 some vinegar that reconstitutes
               the chipotles.

1083
00:39:33,488 --> 00:39:35,422
     Absolutely.
     Which is a smoked jalapeño.

1084
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,923
       Got 'em right here.

1085
00:39:36,925 --> 00:39:38,625
  Put the strainer in the pot,

1086
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:40,260
    and then we're gonna add
   everything in the strainer.

1087
00:39:40,262 --> 00:39:41,895
                           Okay.
     Whole heads of garlic.

1088
00:39:41,897 --> 00:39:43,430
        Onions in there.
              Wow, this is cool.

1089
00:39:43,432 --> 00:39:45,265
    Cinnamon sticks, a little
    sweetness with the heat,

1090
00:39:45,267 --> 00:39:47,033
       thyme, the oregano.

1091
00:39:47,035 --> 00:39:49,002
     Like a cup, just about.
     Throw some bay leaves.

1092
00:39:49,004 --> 00:39:50,370
     Peel and seal it.
                             Oh!

1093
00:39:50,372 --> 00:39:53,506
       This, crystallized, hard,
         Mexican sugar. Awesome.

1094
00:39:53,508 --> 00:39:56,042
     Add just a few cloves,
         oranges, water,

1095
00:39:56,044 --> 00:39:57,710
   straight-up white vinegar.

1096
00:39:57,712 --> 00:39:59,412
And this is pineapple and orange

1097
00:39:59,414 --> 00:40:02,148
    that I just let steep in
   cold water for a few days.

1098
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,584
  Let that cook down for about
          3 1/2 hours.

1099
00:40:04,586 --> 00:40:06,119
                 All right,
            so this is simmered.

1100
00:40:06,121 --> 00:40:08,021
    Strain out all the solids
         from the Adobo.

1101
00:40:08,023 --> 00:40:10,090
   Look at 'em, how they soak up
               all that juice.

1102
00:40:10,092 --> 00:40:11,624
     A little tomato puree.

1103
00:40:11,626 --> 00:40:13,493
    Let it boil out, go ahead
       and give this a --

1104
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:15,562
       Whoo! How much longer are
       we gonna let this simmer?

1105
00:40:15,564 --> 00:40:17,931
        For about another
        15 or 20 minutes.

1106
00:40:17,933 --> 00:40:19,299
           I don't feel any more
                chunks, boss.

1107
00:40:19,301 --> 00:40:21,167
 I think we're good to go, then.

1108
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:22,635
         Check this out.

1109
00:40:22,637 --> 00:40:24,137
              That is awesome.

1110
00:40:24,139 --> 00:40:25,538
              Aw, you're gonna
             put that on wings.

1111
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,073
    Season them with a little
          kosher salt,

1112
00:40:27,075 --> 00:40:29,209
 a little cracked black pepper,
   and toss 'em in the sauce.

1113
00:40:29,211 --> 00:40:30,510
  Nice, thickened up a little.

1114
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:32,011
    And you don't just serve 'em
like that, put 'em on the grill?

1115
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,413
   No, we actually put 'em on
           the grill,

1116
00:40:33,415 --> 00:40:35,482
   just a little more flavor,
put 'em right back in this bowl.

1117
00:40:35,484 --> 00:40:37,383
    Awesome, and we're gonna
  come over here and plate 'em,

1118
00:40:37,385 --> 00:40:38,618
            a little
     avocado ranch dressing.

1119
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,654
                 Here we go.
               Mm, gosh, dude.

1120
00:40:41,656 --> 00:40:43,423
          Mm, these are rocking.

1121
00:40:43,425 --> 00:40:45,959
     The sauce is out of bounds.

1122
00:40:45,961 --> 00:40:50,063
        Right heat, right spice.
                 Mm, mm, mm!

1123
00:40:50,065 --> 00:40:51,965
             Dude, you are truly
            a rock star on this.

1124
00:40:51,967 --> 00:40:53,600
                       Nice job.
          Thanks, man.

1125
00:40:53,602 --> 00:40:54,868
    Got to come try these wings.

1126
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,035
          Adobo wings.
Fantastic.

1127
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,170
              MAN:
   Caramelized on the outside,

1128
00:40:57,172 --> 00:40:58,538
       when it's grilled,
      puts it over the top.

1129
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,007
Pork mole platter.
    Fresh food, unique food.

1130
00:41:01,009 --> 00:41:03,443
            Amazing.
Adobo mac and cheese, please.

1131
00:41:03,445 --> 00:41:04,644
You're knocking this food out.
  It's a great job.

1132
00:41:04,646 --> 00:41:05,745
                Thanks, man.
           I appreciate it, man.

1133
00:41:05,747 --> 00:41:06,913
It's really a pleasure.
                      Thank you.

1134
00:41:06,915 --> 00:41:09,782
        So, that's it for
this road trip, but don't worry,

1135
00:41:09,784 --> 00:41:12,919
  we got plenty more joints to
   find all over this country!

1136
00:41:12,921 --> 00:41:14,654
     I'll be looking for you
            next time

1137
00:41:14,656 --> 00:41:17,257
     on "Diners, Drive-ins,
           and Dives."

1138
00:41:17,259 --> 00:41:19,626
          [ Applause ]
            Amazing.

1139
00:41:19,628 --> 00:41:22,061
           Did you see the tear?
  Actually, I got a little tear.

1140
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:26,065
   He gave you the ring, and you
started to cry, I'm, like, "Ah!"
