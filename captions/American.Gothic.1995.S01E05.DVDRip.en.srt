1
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,147
Evening, Holly G.

2
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,901
Afraid you're under arrest.

3
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,528
On what charge?

4
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,200
Stealing my heart.

5
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,048
God,
I love a man in uniform.

6
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:40,184
Hey, boyfriend.
Hey, yourself.

7
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,852
Where's my file?

8
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,188
I love you, Lucas Buck.

9
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:47,065
I know you do, darling.
Where's the file?

10
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,068
Almost got caught
sneaking it out.

11
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,613
Birth record on
one Caleb Temple.

12
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,072
Good work.

13
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,742
So what's this baby
to you, anyway?

14
00:01:56,825 --> 00:02:00,204
I told you. I'm investigating
the mother's suicide.

15
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:01,496
Hmm.

16
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,083
What's "hmm"?
Nothing.

17
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,420
Where we going?
I'm taking you home.

18
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:09,713
Home?

19
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:13,217
But you promised we'd go
dancing or maybe take
a swim under Johnson Bridge.

20
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,885
No, not tonight.

21
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,685
You're the father,
aren't you?

22
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:24,728
What?

23
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,190
That baby's yours.
Don't be crazy.

24
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,192
All week it's been:

25
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:33,487
"How's the baby doing?
Did you check on the baby?"

26
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,407
You're Caleb Temple's father.

27
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,326
Put on your seat belt.

28
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,750
If you really loved me...

29
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,377
you would have told me
the truth.

30
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,962
You got
an overactive imagination.

31
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,880
You stop lying!
Hey, calm down, will you?

32
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:53,298
I will not!

33
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:57,177
And I ain't keeping
your dirty little secret,
neither.

34
00:02:58,554 --> 00:02:59,972
You used me.

35
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:05,102
And I'm gonna tell everybody
what you've done.

36
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,689
Everybody's gonna know
about that baby.

37
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,530
Holly, I don't want things
to end this way.

38
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,661
So I've changed my mind
about that swim.

39
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:27,476
What you hunting, Caleb?
Wild boar.

40
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,727
Me, too.

41
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,942
Got him!

42
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,366
My boar's dead.

43
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,034
Mine got away.

44
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,496
Your friend's
quite a shot, ain't he?

45
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,623
Well, he's the best.

46
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,416
The best man
don't always win.

47
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,673
Boone, would you mind
if I gave Caleb some tips?

48
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:58,715
No, sir.

49
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,969
Why don't you run home
and pick up some flowers
for your mama on the way?

50
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,220
On me.

51
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,556
But we're practicing
for the contest.

52
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,101
I don't think Boone here needs
any more practice, do you?

53
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:10,644
Go on, Boone.

54
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,652
So where'd you get that thing?
Five-and-dime?

55
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:20,946
My daddy
gave it to me.

56
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,323
I guess it's serviceable.
If you know how to work it.

57
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:25,909
I can work it just fine.
Prove it.

58
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:33,500
Anybody could hit that thing.
What about a man's target?

59
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,045
How about...

60
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,758
...that crow?
Think you could reach him?

61
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,802
I don't kill nothing
I don't eat.

62
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:46,388
Hell, cherry farmers
around here kill them
by the handful.

63
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,806
Pests, vermin.

64
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,308
Ruin a whole crop
if you let them.

65
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,101
Well, he didn't do
nothing to me.

66
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:53,478
I get it.
He's a little too far for you?

67
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,939
That's all right.
No, he's not too far.

68
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,983
Go on, Mr. Crow. Long life.

69
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,861
Nothing to worry about
from this little fellow.

70
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,453
I got him.

71
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:15,709
Well, all right.
See, I hit him dead on.

72
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,711
What are you doing?

73
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:18,879
Taking off a claw.

74
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,464
You've earned yourself
a talisman.

75
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,382
I don't want that thing.

76
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:24,176
What do you mean?
You killed it, you own it.

77
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,260
You made me.

78
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:29,515
Son, nobody makes anybody
do anything they don't want
to do in the first place.

79
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:32,059
I ain't listening to you
no more.
Caleb?

80
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,561
I ain't listening to you
no more.

81
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,840
Now, you for example...

82
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,886
are a fall color,
so you would do well
with our Autumn Glow.

83
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,763
Mrs. Gallagher?
Yes?

84
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,516
It's Gail Emory.

85
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:15,435
A friend of Holly's.

86
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,397
Will you ladies
give me a moment?

87
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,481
Surely.

88
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,151
Gail Emory.

89
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:25,737
You remember me?
Of course I do.

90
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:28,031
Well, all grown up.

91
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,577
And with a perfect
summer complexion.

92
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,413
You look wonderful.
I wasn't even sure that...

93
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:37,374
I mean you look great.

94
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,002
Thank you.
I'm so happy to see you.

95
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,922
What brings you back to town?
My cousin, Caleb Temple.

96
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:47,134
I'm sure that you heard
what happened to
his father and his sister.

97
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,553
Yes. What an ugly mess.

98
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,097
I thought maybe if I knew
a little more
about his past...

99
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,975
I would be able to help him
through this, so...

100
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:59,521
I understand that Holly was
working at the hospital
when his mother died.

101
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:01,940
Why don't you come inside,
Gail?

102
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,989
You and Holly
were friends in what?

103
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,490
Fourth grade?
That's right.

104
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:14,536
Then you probably remember
our house during
its avocado period.

105
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,872
All greens and oranges.

106
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,499
Lots of changes since then.

107
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,089
This is exactly
as Holly left it.

108
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:29,009
She doesn't live here
anymore?

109
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,472
Holly's dead, Gail.

110
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:36,308
It's been over
10 years now.

111
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,602
Car accident.

112
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,104
I'm sorry, Mrs. Gallagher.

113
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:42,898
It's all right.

114
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,817
I like to show people
this room...

115
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:49,279
because I think it says
more about Holly...

116
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,365
than I ever could.

117
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,535
There's
her nursing certificate...

118
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:57,496
and her commendation
from the Ladies League.

119
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:00,040
Holly had great potential.

120
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:03,585
Everyone thought she was
going to conquer the world.

121
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:08,674
And so did I.

122
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,512
Would you like some lemonade?

123
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:14,596
Sure.

124
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,445
Yes, Miss Welsley.

125
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,656
All right, Miss Welsley.

126
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,326
We'll send you
our sample pack right away.

127
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,286
Thank you for calling.

128
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,414
Was Holly seeing anyone
when she died?

129
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,083
She was very popular.

130
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,670
But there was no one serious.

131
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:29,922
Are you sure?

132
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,716
You're a romantic,
aren't you?

133
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,510
Just like my Holly.

134
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,887
Have some lemonade.

135
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:52,903
You gonna shoot me, too?

136
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:54,863
Hey.

137
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:59,368
How long you been here?
Long enough.

138
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:03,580
What happened today, Caleb?

139
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:04,748
Nothing.

140
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,416
Well, you're not sleeping.

141
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,585
I didn't wanna
shoot that crow, Merly.

142
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:09,837
I swear.

143
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,172
I just...

144
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:16,134
Something came over me.

145
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,637
Lucas is a part of you,
Caleb.

146
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,723
The sooner you accept that,
the better.

147
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:24,476
Does that mean
I gotta be like he is?

148
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,979
No. But you can't
run from him.

149
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,899
Guess I can't run from you,
neither.

150
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,154
Do you get smarter
when you die?

151
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:37,698
I don't know.

152
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,248
I'm scared, Merly.

153
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,667
So am I.

154
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:16,862
Barbara Joy?

155
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,199
Now look what you
made me do.

156
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:22,159
Now, what are you doing?

157
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:25,245
Righting
a centuries-old wrong,
I'm told.

158
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:29,625
Ben Junior's been getting
some flack about
this damn thing at school.

159
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,043
It ain't P.C.

160
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:35,714
If you're here to see him,
you're two weeks early.

161
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,966
I'm here to see your husband.

162
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,676
About what?

163
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:43,639
How about taking off
those glasses?

164
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:48,185
He's in the shop.

165
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,322
Waylon?

166
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:03,408
Well,
if it ain't Deputy Dawg.

167
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:05,953
It's nice to see you, too.

168
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:08,872
Watch out there, Son.

169
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:10,123
Sorry, Daddy.

170
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,711
Hey, Ben. How you doing?

171
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:18,090
All right, I guess.

172
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,758
What else do you say, Son?

173
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:23,637
I'm fine,
thank you for asking.
How are you?

174
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:25,889
I've been better.

175
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:31,436
Son, would you mind if I talk
to your stepfather
for a minute alone?

176
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,731
He's a big boy now.
He can hear anything
you've got to say.

177
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:37,150
I really don't think
that's a good idea.

178
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,863
Weekend father
laying down the law.

179
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:46,368
Okay, Benji, run up and ask
your mama to hustle us up
some sandwiches.

180
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,788
Yes, sir.

181
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:55,836
Private enough for you?

182
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:01,133
Your wife's wearing
dark glasses.

183
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:03,051
And you're wearing
rayon pants.

184
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:05,679
You're here to
dissect her wardrobe?

185
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:07,931
How you two
been getting along?

186
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:09,683
Excuse me, Deputy...

187
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:12,352
but since when was that
any of your business?

188
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:13,937
She's the mother
of my child.

189
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:16,481
Well, that may be,
but she's my wife now.

190
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:19,902
Well, that don't give you
any reason to mistreat her.

191
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:21,945
She call you up here?

192
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:22,988
No.

193
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:26,450
Is this police business?
Well, not yet.

194
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,037
Well, then...

195
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,128
I guess you ain't got
a leg to stand on.

196
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:50,015
Benji, get the deputy here
some ice.

197
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:51,934
He walked into a door.

198
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,371
Hey, Sheriff. What is
an eight-letter word
for "snoop"?

199
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,874
"Intruder"?

200
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:18,585
Has to end in a "Y."

201
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:21,964
Reach for the stars, Floyd.

202
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:27,135
Hello, Miss Emory.
I see my tax dollars
are hard at work.

203
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:30,055
Sounds like we're in
for an exposé.

204
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,724
You want me to pad
some expense reports for you?

205
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:35,352
I'd rather you answer
a few questions...

206
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:36,728
about Holly Gallagher.

207
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:38,605
Now there's a name
from the vault.

208
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,484
"Every time I see
your angelic face...

209
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:46,488
"my heart sings with the joy
of a thousand trumpets."

210
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,866
So I was a lousy poet.
What's the point?

211
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,576
You were seeing her
when she died.

212
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:51,618
Jealous?

213
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:54,538
We had dinner
a couple of times. Sweet girl.

214
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,583
Little obsessive.
I suppose
you found the body.

215
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:00,627
Wrong. Her car went off
the Johnson Bridge,
we never found nothing.

216
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:01,837
How hard did you look?

217
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,380
We had all kinds of divers,
ma'am.

218
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:04,923
Hell, even used
coast guard radar.

219
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:06,967
No luck.
The coast guard?

220
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,927
Slow news day?

221
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,266
What the hell
happened to you?
Nothing.

222
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,476
Look,
there's no mystery here.

223
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,936
But if you try
and invent one...

224
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:19,771
Holly's mother's the one
who's gonna suffer.

225
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:22,274
She's put this behind her,
I suggest you do the same.

226
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:26,069
Holly was a nurse
at the hospital when
Caleb's mother died.

227
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:29,448
I'm aware of that, ma'am.
She was also my friend.

228
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,328
Would you get out of the way,
please?

229
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:47,466
Floyd, I believe I've found
your magic word.

230
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:48,967
What's that?

231
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,302
Busybody.

232
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:59,186
Who done this to you, Ben?

233
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:01,188
Waylon Flood.

234
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,273
Family dispute?

235
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:04,816
Yeah, you could say that.

236
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,402
You want me to handle it?
No.

237
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:11,615
Well, people lose
respect for you,
they lose respect for me.

238
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,368
And I can't have that
in my town.

239
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:17,371
I'll take care of it, Lucas.
You'd better.

240
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:25,128
Can't we all just get along?

241
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:28,090
We live in a violent world...

242
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:32,135
but that doesn't mean
we need to succumb
to our basic instincts.

243
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:34,638
People like
Martin Luther King...

244
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:37,182
Gandhi and
Robert E. Lee all believed...

245
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:40,352
there was a peaceful solution
to every problem.

246
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,354
Yes, Charlotte?

247
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:45,691
I thought Robert E. Lee
was a general
in the Civil War.

248
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:47,526
Well, yes, he was, darling.

249
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:49,403
But only because
he was pushed.

250
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:55,784
Boone Mackenzie,
would you come here a moment?

251
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:02,916
This is yours, isn't it?

252
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:06,628
Well, what's happened
to your penmanship?

253
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:09,506
I had a blister.

254
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:12,593
Well, Boone, I'm afraid all
these outside activities...

255
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:14,678
are getting in the way
of your work.

256
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,722
I'm sorry, Miss Coombs.

257
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:19,683
But it's better now.
Good.

258
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:22,811
Then maybe we'd like to take
another pass at this.

259
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:26,023
But we've got practice.
The contest is tomorrow.

260
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:28,400
Well, I'm aware
of that, Caleb...

261
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:31,486
but I think this is
more important, don't you?

262
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:34,489
No.

263
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:39,244
It's okay.
I'll catch up with you later.

264
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:57,179
Hey, hotshot.

265
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:58,430
Leave me alone.

266
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:01,225
On your way to practice?
I wouldn't want to
interfere with that.

267
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:04,728
Practice is an important part
of the victory equation.

268
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:08,232
Of course,
there is another part.

269
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:09,274
What?

270
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:12,236
The right tools.

271
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:23,121
Well, what are you
waiting for? Pick it up.

272
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:25,666
Whose is it?
Yours, of course.

273
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:27,835
I felt so bad about
what happened yesterday...

274
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:29,920
I didn't want us getting off
on the wrong foot.

275
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:31,088
Here.

276
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:37,052
Feels good, don't it?

277
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,888
Much better than this
old branch you were using.

278
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:41,473
It's so light.

279
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:43,642
It's more then that, Son.

280
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:45,853
It's your ticket to glory.

281
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:51,650
What say we take it
for a test drive?

282
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:02,578
Water's real muddy.

283
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:04,621
The vehicle's only down there
about 15 feet.

284
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:07,416
I can't believe
they couldn't find it.
Maybe they didn't look.

285
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:11,170
Or maybe the Sheriff
just wants to let
sleeping dogs lie.

286
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:16,633
You have a problem
with this?

287
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:17,634
No.

288
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:19,761
Just leave my name
out of the papers.

289
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:26,310
All right, T.J.
Let's do it.

290
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:14,316
Can you help me
with this door?

291
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:16,985
Sorry, ma'am. I knew Holly.

292
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,500
There's nothing in here.

293
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,612
How tall was she?
Holly?

294
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:45,115
Little bit shorter
than you, I reckon.

295
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:49,995
She was shorter.

296
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,752
She wasn't driving.

297
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:02,382
I ain't shooting
no more crows.

298
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:04,218
Of course not.
Playtime's over.

299
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:06,178
And now that you've got
the right equipment...

300
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,971
all you're missing is
the fire in the belly.

301
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:09,681
A what in the belly?

302
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:13,101
The will to win, Son.
The burning desire to conquer.

303
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:15,062
You know how you find it?
No.

304
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:18,232
By letting go.
Let go of your fear...

305
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:21,693
see yourself in
the winner's circle,
and there you are.

306
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:24,154
Now who's the best shot
out here?

307
00:23:28,784 --> 00:23:30,160
Josh is pretty good.

308
00:23:30,202 --> 00:23:32,246
Then you set up next to him
and I'll teach you...

309
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:34,957
a little something
about psychological warfare.

310
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,166
Go on.

311
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,502
Hold on, boy.

312
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:41,505
Don't just slink
over there.

313
00:23:41,547 --> 00:23:44,883
It's not who you are,
it's who people think you are.

314
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,969
Give him some attitude.

315
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:54,017
First shot will be
the most important.

316
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:56,395
'Cause that's the one
he'll be watching.

317
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:59,731
Use the equipment,
trust the sights.

318
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:02,359
And let go.

319
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:12,327
Whoa!
What'd I tell you?

320
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:14,538
Nice shot, Caleb.
Thanks.

321
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:15,956
Don't thank him.

322
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:18,375
Just smile like it's
the easiest thing
in the world.

323
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:20,210
Let's see it again.

324
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:31,263
It works.
Of course it works.

325
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:32,931
Wow, two in a row.

326
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:34,558
Still...
What?

327
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:37,186
...Boone's better then me.

328
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:39,897
Well, if you believe that,
you ain't got a chance.

329
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,858
Gotta put Boone in his place.
But he's my best friend.

330
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:45,068
No room for friendship
on the battlefield, Son.

331
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,571
He'd gladly beat you,
wouldn't he?

332
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:49,990
I guess.
Close your eyes.

333
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:52,534
Go on.

334
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:58,290
Now, picture Boone's face
up there on that target.

335
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:01,919
You see him?

336
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,962
Yeah.
Okay. Now...

337
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:07,674
if he was really
your friend...

338
00:25:09,384 --> 00:25:11,053
would he want to
humiliate you...

339
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:13,180
in front of all those people
tomorrow?

340
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:14,473
No.

341
00:25:15,057 --> 00:25:18,852
If he was really your friend,
he'd be trying to help you,
wouldn't he?

342
00:25:18,936 --> 00:25:19,937
I guess.

343
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,563
He's your enemy, Caleb.

344
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:23,482
Never forget that.

345
00:25:24,358 --> 00:25:25,984
He's your enemy.

346
00:25:27,152 --> 00:25:29,613
Now, open your eyes.

347
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:34,326
And meet your new best friend.

348
00:25:37,621 --> 00:25:39,790
Don't you worry,
Mrs. Balstrap.

349
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:42,042
I'm sure the dentist
will know what to do.

350
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,005
No, I would not advise
trying to take
the braces off yourself.

351
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:49,466
Look,
could you hold on a sec?

352
00:25:49,508 --> 00:25:51,385
Doc, I got a lady
on the phone here...

353
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:53,846
whose son fell off his bike,
landed on his face...

354
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:56,348
and mashed his braces
up into his gums.

355
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,308
Now, what do I tell her?

356
00:25:58,392 --> 00:26:00,936
Get him to a dentist.
That's what I've been
telling her.

357
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:02,688
She's fighting me.

358
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,981
Mrs. Balstrap...

359
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:05,899
the doctor here says you
should get Clarence...

360
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:08,360
to the dentist
as soon as possible.

361
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:11,196
Well, now I don't know
about that.

362
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:13,907
All right. Bye.

363
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:17,995
She says she can't afford
any more dental work.

364
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:21,290
She wants to know if Lucas
will loan her the money.

365
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:22,833
What a world.

366
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:24,501
Ben?

367
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:27,087
Well, Sheriff's out, Doc.

368
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:28,964
I came to see you.

369
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:30,465
Well, sit down.

370
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:37,097
Your ex-wife came to
see me again.

371
00:26:38,015 --> 00:26:40,517
She had some
pretty serious bruises.

372
00:26:42,853 --> 00:26:45,314
I'm gonna kill that
son of a bitch...
Now, hold on.

373
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:47,983
I'm not here to make
the situation worse.

374
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:51,320
Your wife is an adult.
If she wants to
change her life, she will.

375
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:53,363
Your son doesn't have
any choice in this.

376
00:26:53,447 --> 00:26:55,282
Did he hurt my boy?

377
00:26:55,574 --> 00:26:57,201
Not physically. No.

378
00:26:57,242 --> 00:26:58,994
But if that man is his
only role model...

379
00:26:59,077 --> 00:27:00,913
he's gonna think
that kind of behavior's okay.

380
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,374
Well, I see him
twice a month.

381
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:06,460
Have you talked to him
about this?
No.

382
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:09,004
Spousal abuse is
a learned behavior.

383
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:11,965
Your son needs to know that
what's happening is wrong...

384
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,926
and it won't be tolerated.

385
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:17,054
Well, I've wanted to spend
more time with him.

386
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:19,973
But Barbara Joy just...

387
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:24,853
She doesn't have
much respect for me.

388
00:27:28,232 --> 00:27:31,109
This might be an opportunity
to change that.

389
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:35,280
I could throw Waylon's
sorry ass in jail.

390
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:37,741
Well, that's your call.

391
00:27:37,783 --> 00:27:41,245
But if you do, he may end up
looking like the victim.

392
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:44,998
Talk to your son, Ben.

393
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:47,584
Talk to him.

394
00:27:56,677 --> 00:27:58,554
Gail?
Mrs. Gallagher.

395
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:01,557
I'm kind of busy right now.

396
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:03,392
We need to talk.

397
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,979
All right. Come on in.

398
00:28:12,651 --> 00:28:15,195
Thin mint?
No, thank you.

399
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:20,576
I went to Johnson's Bridge
this afternoon.

400
00:28:20,993 --> 00:28:22,661
What on earth for?

401
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:25,247
To find Holly's car.

402
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:28,083
It was only in 15 feet
of water.

403
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:30,002
You had no right to do that.

404
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:33,881
You don't want to know
what happened?
I know what happened.

405
00:28:38,844 --> 00:28:41,054
Lynda Lee,
how may I help you?

406
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:45,976
I can't talk to you right now.

407
00:28:46,977 --> 00:28:48,687
I can't talk.

408
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,065
I'll have to call you back.

409
00:28:56,612 --> 00:28:58,697
Why are you
doing this to me?

410
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,700
Her body wasn't in the car,
Mrs. Gallagher.

411
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:04,620
But more importantly,
I don't think
that she was driving.

412
00:29:04,703 --> 00:29:06,872
What difference
does it make?

413
00:29:07,873 --> 00:29:09,791
Holly is dead.

414
00:29:11,543 --> 00:29:13,962
I would just appreciate it
if you would just...

415
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:15,172
Janice?

416
00:29:15,214 --> 00:29:17,925
You said this would
only take a minute.

417
00:29:19,218 --> 00:29:20,552
I'm sorry.

418
00:29:23,138 --> 00:29:25,766
Miss Emory
was just leaving.

419
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:44,409
Mrs. Gallagher,
I'm sorry to call you back.

420
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:47,371
I'm sorry,
what kind of place is this?

421
00:29:47,538 --> 00:29:49,414
It's a sanitarium, ma'am.

422
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:51,959
We have a question
about Holly's medication.

423
00:30:14,106 --> 00:30:15,566
Yeah, right.

424
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:18,443
Ain't you got nothing better
to do than annoy people?

425
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:20,821
I've come to apologize,
Waylon.

426
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,115
Is that so?

427
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:25,325
Yeah, I believe
I mishandled things.

428
00:30:25,409 --> 00:30:27,411
Well, you got that right.

429
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:30,289
So, what do you got
to say to me?

430
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,374
I ain't got nothing
to say to you.

431
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:33,709
This is for my son.

432
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:41,508
I'm sorry I asked you to leave
earlier today, Son.

433
00:30:41,592 --> 00:30:44,887
Waylon here was right, you are
old enough to hear this.

434
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,763
What is this garbage?

435
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:49,766
I'm afraid your
stepfather here is a coward.

436
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:52,519
He thinks that the way to
control people is by
bullying them

437
00:30:52,603 --> 00:30:53,770
and beating on them.

438
00:30:53,812 --> 00:30:55,480
You're on my property, Deputy.

439
00:30:55,564 --> 00:30:58,275
But I'm here to tell you that
all that's gonna stop now.

440
00:30:58,317 --> 00:31:01,778
'Cause you don't deserve it.
And neither does your mother.

441
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,864
Get out of here, boy. Git!

442
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:06,575
You go on, Son,
and you tell your mama...

443
00:31:06,658 --> 00:31:09,161
that everything's gonna be
fine now.

444
00:31:12,748 --> 00:31:17,586
All right, now we can
either talk or you can
try hitting me again.

445
00:31:25,302 --> 00:31:28,430
Hell, Ben,
what kind of choice is that?

446
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:30,974
It's yours.
Look.

447
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,853
Maybe I have been a bit harsh.

448
00:31:34,937 --> 00:31:37,189
I've had a lot of pressure
in the business.

449
00:31:37,231 --> 00:31:40,108
You tell Sheriff Buck that
I appreciate the warning...

450
00:31:40,192 --> 00:31:42,694
and I won't ever lay a hand
on Barbara Joy again.

451
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:44,738
And you gonna stop
bullying my boy?

452
00:31:44,821 --> 00:31:46,448
Yeah, yeah, sure.

453
00:31:46,865 --> 00:31:49,701
Hell, these are the hands
of an artist.

454
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:52,162
Then I guess
we're done talking.

455
00:32:55,225 --> 00:32:56,393
Holly?

456
00:32:59,855 --> 00:33:01,231
It's Gail.

457
00:33:02,107 --> 00:33:03,483
Gail Emory.

458
00:33:04,151 --> 00:33:05,235
Gail?

459
00:33:05,777 --> 00:33:07,196
Gail Emory?

460
00:33:07,738 --> 00:33:09,448
Do you remember me?

461
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:11,033
Is he here?

462
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:12,993
Who?

463
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:15,078
My boyfriend.

464
00:33:17,372 --> 00:33:19,333
Who's your boyfriend, Holly?

465
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:22,920
"Every time I see
your angelic face...

466
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:27,549
"my heart sings with the joy
of a thousand trumpets."

467
00:33:28,634 --> 00:33:30,469
What happened, Holly?

468
00:33:31,261 --> 00:33:32,638
He's here.

469
00:33:37,434 --> 00:33:39,144
Evening, Holly G.

470
00:33:40,145 --> 00:33:42,272
Afraid you're under arrest.

471
00:33:42,356 --> 00:33:44,149
On what charge?

472
00:33:46,235 --> 00:33:47,945
Stealing my heart.

473
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:06,672
Why didn't you tell me
she was still alive?

474
00:34:06,755 --> 00:34:09,049
Now, don't take it
personally.
Nobody in town knows.

475
00:34:09,132 --> 00:34:12,052
That's the way Holly's mama
wants it to stay.

476
00:34:12,845 --> 00:34:15,347
I think she invested so much
of herself in that child...

477
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:18,433
the thought of living
with her this way was
just too much to bear.

478
00:34:18,517 --> 00:34:20,561
Four minutes
without oxygen.

479
00:34:20,644 --> 00:34:23,689
That's all it took,
a lifetime of dreams
washed away.

480
00:34:23,814 --> 00:34:25,816
You were driving the car,
weren't you?

481
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:27,317
I've tried to do
the right thing.

482
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,696
I found this place for her.
Visit at least once a week.

483
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:32,489
You were driving the car.

484
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:35,450
And I want to know
what happened that night.

485
00:34:39,663 --> 00:34:41,206
Get in the car.

486
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:44,751
I don't need
a demonstration.

487
00:34:44,835 --> 00:34:48,130
Words are cheap, Miss Emory.
If you really want to know
what happened...

488
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:49,506
I'm gonna have to show you.

489
00:34:49,548 --> 00:34:53,260
Awful lot of people in there
saw you come out here with me.

490
00:34:54,303 --> 00:34:57,598
Then you don't have anything
to worry about, do you?

491
00:34:59,183 --> 00:35:00,350
Get in.

492
00:35:09,193 --> 00:35:11,069
Put on your seat belt.

493
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:19,286
You like dancing?

494
00:35:20,037 --> 00:35:22,956
Holly sure did.
She could dance up a storm.

495
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:27,836
Where are we going?

496
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,923
That's funny. Holly asked me
the same question.

497
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:34,551
I thought we'd retrace
the steps of
that fateful night.

498
00:35:35,385 --> 00:35:38,805
I believe I could drive
this road with
my eyes closed.

499
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:42,976
I'm not impressed.
Have faith, Miss Emory.

500
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,562
See, that was Holly's problem.
She lost her faith.

501
00:35:45,771 --> 00:35:47,856
Slow down.
No faith in me.

502
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,109
No faith in love.
And mostly,
no faith in herself.

503
00:35:52,611 --> 00:35:54,738
Were you playing this game
with her, too?

504
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:56,782
No game. We were past that.

505
00:35:56,823 --> 00:35:58,742
She realized it was
over between us.

506
00:35:59,326 --> 00:36:01,578
And she wasn't wrong.
Enough.

507
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,081
Open your eyes.
She grabbed the wheel...

508
00:36:04,122 --> 00:36:07,084
Open your eyes!
I couldn't control the car.

509
00:36:23,976 --> 00:36:25,227
You see?

510
00:36:25,477 --> 00:36:27,563
She wanted us both to die.

511
00:36:28,522 --> 00:36:29,648
Why?

512
00:36:31,275 --> 00:36:33,652
Because she was a romantic,
Gail.

513
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:47,124
And so am I.

514
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:12,858
Next up, Caleb Temple.

515
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:32,377
Doing real good, Caleb.
That practice sure paid off.

516
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:35,130
And now up is
Boone Mackenzie.

517
00:37:39,927 --> 00:37:41,970
That was a good shot, too,
honey.

518
00:37:42,054 --> 00:37:43,096
Nice shot.

519
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:47,142
Nice try.
It's okay.
We're both in the lead.

520
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:49,811
Don't you want to win?

521
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:53,315
Of course. But if I don't,
your winning is just as good.

522
00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:02,741
Come on, honey. Come on.

523
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:06,745
Go ahead.

524
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:09,540
Dad?

525
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:13,418
Hi, Son.

526
00:38:15,087 --> 00:38:16,839
What you doing here?

527
00:38:17,256 --> 00:38:20,717
I just wanted to tell you
that it meant a lot to Mama...

528
00:38:20,926 --> 00:38:23,846
your coming by the hospital
to see Mr. Flood.

529
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,811
Well, I'm real sorry
about what happened.

530
00:38:30,894 --> 00:38:32,980
It meant a lot to me, too.

531
00:38:33,063 --> 00:38:35,023
I appreciate that, Son.

532
00:38:40,195 --> 00:38:42,906
You'd do the same for me,
wouldn't you?

533
00:38:46,285 --> 00:38:48,996
Well, I guess
I'll see you around, huh?

534
00:38:51,123 --> 00:38:53,125
Yeah, I believe
you will.

535
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,471
Now trying to break the tie,
Caleb Temple.

536
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,543
Better luck next time,
Caleb.

537
00:39:37,836 --> 00:39:41,048
Now shooting his final round,
Boone Mackenzie.

538
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:47,763
I don't want this no more.

539
00:39:48,347 --> 00:39:50,432
I ain't winning your way.

540
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:53,060
Well, Caleb, your call.

541
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:56,396
Just remember,
a good loser,
is still a loser.

542
00:40:02,486 --> 00:40:07,407
In the final round,
Boone Mackenzie leads
Caleb Temple 30-23.

543
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:11,161
Caleb Temple needs a bulls-eye
to win the match.

544
00:40:22,339 --> 00:40:25,008
Don't worry, darling.
He can still win.

545
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:42,109
Boone Mackenzie
wins the match, 30-28.

546
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:43,110
Good.

547
00:40:43,193 --> 00:40:44,194
Well done, Boone.

548
00:40:44,236 --> 00:40:45,237
Good shooting.

549
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:46,697
Stupid game.

550
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:55,956
Congratulations, Boone.
Thanks. You had me scared.

551
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:57,708
You had me scared, too.

552
00:40:57,749 --> 00:41:00,836
But I took my best shot,
and that's what counts.

553
00:41:01,295 --> 00:41:04,798
Sorry about the way
I treated you, though.
It's okay.

554
00:41:05,424 --> 00:41:07,885
But will you still go
boar-hunting with me?

555
00:41:07,926 --> 00:41:11,221
If you'll help me
with my handwriting.
All right.

556
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:51,595
Hello, Gail.

557
00:41:52,346 --> 00:41:55,432
Are you here
for a consultation?

558
00:41:55,807 --> 00:41:57,309
I saw Holly.

559
00:42:02,022 --> 00:42:04,900
I'll bet you didn't know
she was a dancer.

560
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,777
Did you know that?

561
00:42:07,069 --> 00:42:09,530
She had so much talent.

562
00:42:09,947 --> 00:42:11,323
She still may.

563
00:42:11,406 --> 00:42:13,534
Did you know that
she finished first...

564
00:42:13,617 --> 00:42:15,702
in her class
in nursing school?

565
00:42:15,786 --> 00:42:17,162
Number one.

566
00:42:17,746 --> 00:42:19,581
Smart girl, my Holly.

567
00:42:19,998 --> 00:42:22,501
Then why don't you
bring her home?

568
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:27,673
Holly may be different,
but she's still your daughter.

569
00:42:29,049 --> 00:42:32,135
And I'm sure she still wants
to make you proud.

570
00:42:39,393 --> 00:42:41,019
There's my phone.

571
00:42:41,436 --> 00:42:44,147
Another customer
dreaming of a makeover.

572
00:42:45,816 --> 00:42:47,985
Another chance
to be perfect.

573
00:42:52,698 --> 00:42:54,658
Goodbye, Mrs. Gallagher.

574
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,620
Goodbye, Gail.

575
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,181
Okay, let's try it again.

576
00:43:17,681 --> 00:43:21,351
The three most important
vital signs are:

577
00:43:22,352 --> 00:43:25,647
I'll give you a hint.
The first two are:

578
00:43:25,814 --> 00:43:30,360
pulse rate
and body temperature.

579
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:33,989
And the third is...

580
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,491
Lucas Buck.

581
00:43:39,244 --> 00:43:40,579
Good girl.

582
00:43:41,705 --> 00:43:43,665
Blood pressure is right.

583
00:43:47,586 --> 00:43:51,423
You are my
perfect little girl.

584
00:43:52,382 --> 00:43:53,800
Aren't you?

585
00:43:59,765 --> 00:44:02,226
Perfect in every way.

586
00:44:09,525 --> 00:44:12,069
Children are a puzzle,
aren't they?

587
00:44:12,277 --> 00:44:16,782
You give and you give
and you give and you give,
and what do you get back?

588
00:44:17,324 --> 00:44:18,617
Nothing.

589
00:44:19,618 --> 00:44:21,370
He shot that crow,
didn't he?

590
00:44:21,453 --> 00:44:24,122
Big deal.
Even Ben's son could do that.

591
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,753
Where did I go wrong?

592
00:44:31,463 --> 00:44:32,756
Honey...

593
00:44:33,757 --> 00:44:36,426
that's the question
on everyone's lips.
