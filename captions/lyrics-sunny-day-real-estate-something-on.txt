But you were always one to stay the same, girl.
I know you want to be the rain.
And I know that we would fall in there.
For a time and then unfall again.
For a while, I'll take you burying old bones.
Dawn's grey, the sign in the winter light.
And I know that you can feel the pain.
Your eyes speak one hundred million lies.

Don't tell me you've gone astray.
I walk in circles.
I've seen million things that tell me so.

But I was one to play the fool, girl.
Though rules were somewhat dark to me.
And I know that we could fall in there.
For a time and then unfall again.
For a while, I give you darium bound stones.
Grow through the roots of your mind set apart.
And I know that you can feel the pain.
Your eyes speak one hundred million lies.

Don't tell me you've gone astray.
I walk in circles.
I've seen million things that tell me so.

Total anxiety, pay for variety.
Oh, we'll wait for time to turn around.
Turn around your faith.
We'll wait for time to turn.

The world we sold, there was a choir there.
The world we sold, there was a choir there.
Disgrace for you.

Don't tell me you've gone astray.
I talk in circles.
Everlasting chains that bind my purpose.
Only I've seen million things that tell me so.

Total anxiety, pay for variety.
Oh, we'll wait for time to turn around.
Turn around your faith.
We'll wait for time to...
Choked on society, laced with cyanide.
Oh, we'll wait for time to turn around.
Turn around your faith.
We'll wait for time to turn.
Roses in water.
Wise men see.
Move around before centuries.
Later on, we'll travel far.
Roses in wine.
I can see strange ways.

An endless wave.
Strange.

Roses in water.
Wise men see.
Later on, we'll follow love.
Roses in wine.
I can see strange ways.

To walk with me.
An endless wave.
Strange.
Changing every little desire.
We were counting on forces we could not control.
Oh, and all those things you realized.
Were nothing more than a memory displaced through.

So the story's told beyond our grasp.
We were climbing forever, an infinite task.
Shoulders straining with the endless toil.
We're nothing more than a feather moving in the wind.

I want to change everything.
I want to change everything.
I want to blame everything on.

Oh, and all these seeds will grow anyway.
Even though the outcome, we cannot say.
So, you'll always have your time to shine.
Even in the winter of your darkest hour.

I want to change everything.
I want to change everything.
I want to blame everything on.

In the depths of my gloom.
I crawl out for you.
From the peaks of my joy.
I crawl back into.
Oh, letting me down every time you smile.
Every shining time you arrive.
You arrive.
You arrive.
Long days, caught in his room.
Trapped in the gloom of the dying light.
His heart pleads through the wounds that he bleeds.
The wounds he never can close.
Wrong way, mind in a haze.
Never know what he could do.
He thinks, 'I gave her my heart, she tasted my soul.
Now she's gone again.'.
He thinks, 'I gave her my heart, she tasted my blood.
Now she's gone again.'.

Long days, alone with his shame.
Fanning the flames of desire.
His heart breaks as his memory plays images of her betrayal.
Wrong way, his mind in a rage.
Never know what he could do.
He thinks, 'I gave her my heart, she tasted my soul.
Now she's gone again.'.
He thinks, 'I gave her my heart, she tasted my blood.
Now she's gone again.'.

Why did you leave me here?
How could you lead me down here?

He can't decide where to go then, oh.
Two promises, one imperfect, oh.
Walls he's building keep on crumbling down.
Walls are falling, try to keep them sound.
To keep them sound.

Long days, he thinks the time will be soon.
Pacing his room with his dark thoughts.
His heart breaks at the road he must take.
The road that will lead to the end.
Wrong way, he thinks it's time for release.
He'll never know peace in his lifetime.
He thinks, 'I gave her my heart, she tasted my soul.
Now she's gone again.'.
He thinks, 'I gave her my heart, she tasted my blood.
Now she's gone again.'.

Why did you leave me here?
How could you lead me down here?

He can't decide where to go then, oh.
Two promises, one imperfect, oh.
Walls he's building keep on crumbling down.
Walls are falling, now, there is no sound.
There is no sound.
There is no sound.
There is no sound.
Pay for the sign on the hill that says, 'You're home.'.
Pay for the hole in the ground to place your bones.
Pay for the words in your mouth to flow.
Pay for the soles of your shoes to walk the streets of kings.
Pay for the simplest things.

Pay for the food on your plate to live.
Pay for the mood in your mind to give a thought disguised.
Pay for the simplest things.

Who turned.
Who turned the light out?
Who turned.
Who turned away?
Who turned.
Who turned the light out?
Who turned.
Who turned away?

One hundred million.
Fences around us.
Can we own everything.
Including the moon and the sun and the stars?

Pay for the whip on your back to break.
Pay for the chain on your neck to control your life.
Pay for everything.

Who turned.
Who turned the light out?
Who turned.
Who turned away?
Who turned.
Who turned the light out?
Who turned.
Who turned away?

One hundred million.
Fences around us.
Can we own everything.
Including the moon and the sun and the stars?
If I break down all that I am.
A field of wires will see what it's worth to walk.
To break the lines of all that I feel.
If I turn 'round, what matters the most in time.
We're going nowhere.

Don't tell me now.
The days I've had.
To fill it up but spill instead.
Talk to remind.
Days, weeks and hours.

All in time will be.
Later on, we'll try.
Hollow peaks we've climbed.
All these things I've seen.
How it feels to be something on.
That's how the days go.

If I break down all that I am.
A field of wires will see what it's worth to walk.
To break the lines of alternate steel.
In time, we're going nowhere.

Don't tell me, God.
The dreams I've had.
To fill it up but spill instead.
Talk to remind.
Days, weeks and hours.

All in time will be.
Later on, we'll try.
All we gave to fly.
Hollow peaks we've climbed.
All these things I've seen.
How it feels to be something on.
Sun shines on my face.
How its golden design.
Rain falls in this place.
And the fields come alive.
Days are only rumors we've wasted.

We've crossed the millions.
We'll see where we stand.
Far removed from the womb.
Will you carry me across the sea?
Will you carry me?

We can drink from fountains.
And the taste of truth.
Far removed from the womb.
Will you carry me 'cross the sea?
Will you carry me?

Rhythm and mind.
Don't waste no time.
Want to let it all out.
When the chains fall off.
And the walls fall down.
When we break the seal.
And our hearts pour out.
When the frozen ground.
Comes alive around us with a scream.
How is it you feel?
I remember you in the top of my room.
All these things we wondered how to hide.
See how it works when.
All the day long in a bottle of mud.
All these fears we wondered how to hide with our love.

How is it you feel when you run?
Ships won't come in in a bottle of mud.
All this time looking for love.
And you want to find peace.
And you find me.
Mondrary fields, where we run.
See how it works with a bottle of rum.
All this time hiding from death.
And we want to be strong.
But we find...

The true story, a tale.
Writing itself as we sail.
A story, a tale.
Writing itself as we wail.
Oh, no.

Never again, my dear.
Should we come dancing here.
We'll play guitar and video games.

What if we refuse to follow the rules of fashion?
Tell me something you'd tell a fool.
Ways to refuse to follow the rules of fashion.

How is it you feel, then?
Remember you in the top of my room.
All these things remade me and caused.
To be something grand.

Never again shall we.
Come dancing in the sea.
We'll play guitar for a new.
We'll play guitar for a new.
We'll play guitar and video games.

What if we refuse to follow the rules of fashion?
Tell me something you'd tell a fool.
Ways to refuse to follow the rules of fashion.
We choke on the poison wind.
Well, these sad eyes can tell the story.
Walk along an empire's path.
And you said you'd come back again.
But you talk to yourself.
Believing the fear that drives your greed.
When you discover the empty place.
A hollow world of instant pleasures.

The way you were.
So disturbed.
What's your worth?

Try to smile as they devour our youth.

With a diamond eye, you gaze.
At the blackened plains spread out beneath you.
When the lights go out.
You see the world as you have never known it.
And I talked to myself.
Believing that you would come back again.

The way you were.
So disturbed.
What's your worth?
What is it you heard?

Try to smile as they devour our youth.
The days were golden.
We were known to be.
We won't escape this memory.
Forward on, to the place we sail.

Oil to believe.
When you raise an iron hand.
This place without a song for all.
The words just crawl.

Glimmering and everything, another skull.
You said it was dangerous.
Found out the place where you were going.
Follow me down the path.
I take your hopes, I promise you this.
A dying, cold world, but gold.
Shimmering gold.

Come mama now, tell me the story.
Only laughing about our gilded wasteland.
Devoured, torn into pieces.
Come now, we shine.
Small things ever calling out your name.
You hear some other time.
Unchained, alive.
A world undefined.

All to be free.
When you raise an open hand.
This place without a wall.
The words just grow.

Glimmering and everything, another skull.
You said it was dangerous.
Found out the place where you were going.
Follow me down the path.
I take your hopes, I promise you this.
A dying, cold world, but gold.
Shimmering gold.

Come mama now, tell me the story.
Only laughing about our gilded wasteland.
Devoured, torn into pieces.
Come now, we shine.
Small things ever calling out your name.
You hear some other time.
Unchained, alive.
A world undefined.
