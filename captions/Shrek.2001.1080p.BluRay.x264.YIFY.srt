upon her of a fearful sort...</i>

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,640
<i>which could only be broken
by love's first kiss.</i>

4
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,060
<i>She was locked away
in a castle...</i>

5
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,360
<i>guarded by a terrible
fire-breathing dragon.</i>

6

free her from this dreadful prison,</i>

<i>but none prevailed.</i>

8
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,910
<i>She waited in the
dragon's keep...</i>

9
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,910
<i>in the highest room of
the tallest tower...</i>

10

true love's first kiss.</i>

13
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,090
Somebody once told me the
world is gonna roll me

14
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,140
I am not the sharpest
tool in the shed.

15
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,140
She was looking kind of dumb
with her finger and her thumb.

16
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,940
In the shape of an
I on her forehead.

17
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,940
The years start coming and
they don't stop coming.

18
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,860
Fed to the rules and I
hit the ground running.

19
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,200
Didn't make sense not
to live for fun.

20
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,490
Your brain gets smart but
your head gets dumb.

21
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,490
So much to do So much to see.

22
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,160
So what's wrong with
taking the backstreets.

23
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,290
You'll never know
if you don't go.

24
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,830
You'll never shine

You're bundled up now but
wait till you get older.

32
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,400
But the meteor men
beg to differ.

33
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,400
Judging by the hole in
the satellite picture.

34
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,200
The ice we skate is
getting pretty thin.

But, uh, I don't
have any friends.

And I'm not going out
there by myself.

Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea!
I'll stick with you.

Listen, little donkey. Take a look at me.
What am I?

156
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,600
Uh...

157
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,730
- Really tall?
- No! I'm an ogre.

158
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:30,020
You know. Grab your
torch and pitchforks.

159
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,110
Doesn't that bother you?

160
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,320
Nope.

161
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,280

- Really, really.

- Man, I like you. What's your name?

163
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,250
Uh, Shrek.

164
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:47,580
Shrek? Well, you know what
I like about you, Shrek?

165
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,678
You got that kind of.

I like that. I respect that, Shrek.
You all right.

168
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:59,680
Wooh! Look at that. Who'd want
to live in a place like that?

169

That would be my home.

Just beautiful.

That is a nice Boulder.

another thing we have in common.

got somebody in your face.

You're trying to give them a
hint, and they won't leave.

178

There's that awkward silence.

- Uh, what?

Can I stay with you, please?

181
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,890
- Of course!
- Really?

182
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,350
- No.
- Please! I don't wanna go back there!

183
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:49,350
You don't know what it's like to be
considered a freak. Well, maybe you do.

184
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,020
But that's why we gotta stick together.
You gotta let me stay!

- Please! Please!
- Okay! Okay!

I'm making waffles.

308
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,700
She likes Sushi and
hot tubbing anytime.

309
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,240
Her hobbies include cooking and
cleaning for her two evil sisters.

310
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,700
Please welcome Cinderella.

311
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:49,830
Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing
girl from the land of fancy.

312
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,630
Although she lives with seven
other men, she's not easy.

313
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,170
Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and
find out what a live wire she is.

314
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:00,010
Come on. Give it
up for Snow White!

315

And last, but
certainly not least,

316
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,890
bachelorette number three
is a fiery redhead...

317
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,520
from a dragon-guarded castle
surrounded by hot boiling lava!

318

But don't let that cool you off.

319
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:12,900
She's a loaded pistol who likes pina
coladas and getting caught in the rain.

320
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:17,030
Yours for the rescuing,
Princess Fiona!

321
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:19,570
So will it be
bachelorette number one,

322
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:23,160

bachelorette number three?

Okay, okay, uh, number three!

Lord Farquaad, you've
chosen Princess Fiona.

329

If you love pina coladas.

330

- Princess Fiona.</i>

332
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,230
All I have to do is just
find someone who can go...

333
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,570
But I probably should mention the
little thing that happens at night.

334
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,570
- I'll do it.
- Yes, but after sunset...

Princess Fiona my queen,

have the perfect king!

00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,800
You leave them out in the sun, they get all
brown, start sprouting little white hairs.

461
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,880
No! Layers!

462
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,300
Onions have layers.

463
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,680
Ogres have layers!
Onions have layers.

464
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,180
You get it? We both have layers.
(SIGHS)

465
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,690
Oh, you both have layers. Oh.

466
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:34,150
(SNIFFS) You know, not
everybody likes onions.

467
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,860
Cake! Everybody loves cakes!
Cakes have layers.

468
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,860
I don't care... what
everyone likes.

469
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,660
Ogres are not like cakes.

470
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,870
You know what else everybody likes?
Parfaits.

471
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,880
Have you ever met a person, you
say, Let's get some parfait,

472
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,880
they say, No, I don't
like no parfait?

473
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,710
- Parfaits are delicious.
- No!

474
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,550
You dense, irritating,
miniature beast of burden!

475
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:02,550
Ogres are like onions!
End of story.

476
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,600
Bye-bye. See ya later.

477
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:12,860
Parfaits may be the most delicious
thing on the whole damn planet.

478
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,150
You know, I think I
preferred your humming.

479
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,900
Do you have a tissue or something?
I'm making a mess.

480
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,900
Just the word parfait
make me start slobbering.

481
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:31,210
I'm on my way from misery
to happiness today.

482
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:33,790
Uh-huh, uh-huh Uh-huh, uh-huh

483
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:39,340
I'm on my way from misery
to happiness today.

484
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,880
Uh-huh, uh-huh Uh-huh, uh-huh.

485
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:45,890
And everything that you
receive up yonder.

486
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:49,890
Is what you give to
me the day I wander

487
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,940
I'm on my way

488
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,940
I'm on my way

489
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,110
I'm on my way.

490
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,650
Ooh! Shrek! Did you do that?

491
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:06,530
You gotta warn somebody before you
just crack one off. My mouth was open.

492
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:10,330
Believe me, Donkey, if it
was me, you'd be dead.

493
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:13,170
(SNIFFS) It's brimstone.

494
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,420
- We must be getting close.
- Yeah, right, brimstone.

495
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,533
Don't be talking about
it's the brimstone. I

496
00:29:18,546 --> 00:29:20,590
know what I smell. It
wasn't no brimstone.

497
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,630
It didn't come off
no stone neither.

498
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,760
(RUMBLING)

499
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:43,990
Sure, it's big enough, but
look at the location.

500
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:47,030
(LAUGHING)

501
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,830
Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when
you said ogres have layers?

502
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,830
Oh, aye.

503
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:57,500
Well, I have a bit of
a confession to make.

504
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:00,960
Donkeys don't have layers. We wear our
fear right out there on our sleeves.

505
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:03,078
Wait a second. Donkeys
don't have sleeves.

506
00:30:03,091 --> 00:30:05,130
You know what I mean.

507
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,890
You can't tell me you're
afraid of heights.

508
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:10,253
I'm just a little
uncomfortable about being on

509
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,560
a rickety bridge over a
boiling lake of lava!

510
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,690
Come on, Donkey. I'm right
here beside ya, okay?

511
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:19,440
For emotional support,

512
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,070
we'll just tackle this thing together
one little baby step at a time.

513
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:26,070
- Really?
- Really, really.

514
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:29,370
- Okay, that makes me feel so much better.
- Just keep moving.

515
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:34,040
- And don't look down.
- Okay, don't look down. Don't look down.

516
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,500
Don't look down. Keep on moving.
Don't look down.

517
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:41,380
(GASPS) Shrek! I'm
looking down!

518
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,380
Oh, God, I can't do this!
Just let me off, please!

519
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:48,010
- But you're already halfway.
- But I know that half is safe!

520
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:50,890
Okay, fine. I don't have time for this.
You go back.

521
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:53,390
- Shrek, no! Wait!
- Just, Donkey...

522
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:56,560
- Let's have a dance then, shall we?
- Don't do that!

523
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,520
Oh, I'm sorry. Do what?

524
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:03,690
- Oh, this?
- Yes, that!

525
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:07,200
Yes? Yes, do it. Okay.

526
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,570
(SCREAMS) No, Shrek!

527
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,780
- No! Stop it!
- You said do it! I'm doing it.

528
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:17,120
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.
Shrek, I'm gonna die.

529
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:19,710
Oh!

530
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:23,800
That'll do, Donkey.
That'll do.

531
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:29,430
Cool.

532
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:32,260
(DONKEY) So where is this
fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway?

533
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:36,100
Inside, waiting for
us to rescue her.

534
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:39,100
(CHUCKLES) I was talking
about the dragon, Shrek.

535
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,440

537

(DONKEY WHISPERING)
You afraid?

538
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,870
No, but... Shh.

539
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,500
Oh, good. Me neither. (GASPS)

540
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:06,960
'Cause there's nothing
wrong with being afraid.

541
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:10,300
Fear's a sensible response
to an unfamiliar situation.

542
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,430
Unfamiliar dangerous
situation, I might add.

543
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:15,219
With a dragon that breathes fire and
eats knights and breathes fire,

544
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:18,680
it sure doesn't mean you're a
coward if you're a little scared.

545
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,770
I sure as heck am not a coward.
I know that. (GASPS)

546
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:26,190
Donkey, two things, okay?

547
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,820
Shut... up.

548
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,660
Now go over there and see
if you can find any stairs.

549
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,370
Stairs? I thought we was
looking for the princess.

550
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:39,330
The princess will be up the stairs in
the highest room in the tallest tower.

551
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:43,000
- What makes you think she'll be there?
- I read it in a book once.

552
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:47,000
Cool. You handle the dragon.
I'll handle the stairs.

553
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,130
I'll find those stairs.
I'll whip their butt too.

554
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,180
Those stairs won't know
which way they're going.

(CREAKING)

556
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,640
I'm gonna take drastic steps.

557
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,520
Kick it to the kerb. Don't mess with me.
I'm the stair master.

558
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,190
I've mastered the stairs. I wish I had a
step right here. I'd step all over it.

559
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:12,700
Well, at least we know where the
princess is, but where's the...

probably hear this all

- I don't think so.

him that when we get there.

way, Princess.

01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:40,570
Only my true love's kiss
can break the spell.

1068
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:44,190
But, you know, um,
you're kind of an ogre,

1069

and Shrek... well, you
got a lot in common.

Shrek?

Princess, I... Uh, how's
it going, first of all?

1072
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:56,080
Good? Um, good for me too.

1073
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:58,080
I'm okay.

1074
01:03:58,170 --> 01:04:03,050
I saw this flower and thought of
you because it's pretty and...

1075
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:07,380
well, I don't really like it, but I thought
you might like it 'cause you're pretty.

1076
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:10,680
But I like you anyway.

at me, Donkey.

I mean, really,

who could ever love a beast
so hideous and ugly?

don't go together.

- Don't you see, Donkey?

That's just how it has to be.

1088

It's the only way
to break the spell.

1089

- You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.
- No!

1090
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:51,470
You can't breathe a word.
No one must ever know.

1091
01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:53,680
What's the point of being able to
talk if you gotta keep secrets?

1092

Promise you won't tell.
Promise!

1093

All right, all right. I won't tell him.
But you should.

1094

I just know before this is over, I'm gonna
need a whole lot of serious therapy.

wouldn't matter to you.

about her you don't know.

why don't you follow her home?

go with you.

not coming home with me.

a secret chord.

it pleased the Lord.

Oh! Your half. Hmm.

Yes, my half. I helped

get half the Booty.

Now it's my turn!

So you just shut up
and pay attention!

You are mean to me.

appreciate anything that I do!

right, Donkey.

I forgive you... for
stabbing me in the back!

Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers, onion
boy, you're afraid of your own feelings.

again just like you did to Fiona.

you, maybe even love you.

Love me? She said I was
ugly, a hideous creature.

I heard the two
of you talking.

She wasn't talking about you.

She was talking about,
uh, somebody else.

She wasn't talking about me?

Well, then who was
she talking about?

Uh-uh, no way. I am not saying anything.
You don't wanna listen to me.

what did Fiona say about me?

1243
01:13:55,970 --> 01:13:59,100
What are you asking me for? Why
don't you just go ask her?

never make it in time.

Listen to me!

don't listen to him.
