I have a son who's home alone.

Our phones are out of order, so I'd

- No. - Has he been involved
in a household accident?

I don't know. I don't...
I hope not.

and/or any other object that has
become lodged in his throat?

at night when we came to our senses.

01:33:10,341 --> 01:33:13,845
And there he was. Apparently he was
there alone all day with a corpse.

- Oh! - Whew, yeah. He
was okay, you know.

01:33:16,681 --> 01:33:21,603
After six, seven weeks, you know, he
came around and started talking again.

1160
01:33:21,686 --> 01:33:26,149
But he's okay. You know, they get over
it. Kids are resilient like that.
