1
00:02:17,535 --> 00:02:21,922
Diane, 7:15 am. I'll be heading for
the Sheriff's after breakfast.

2
00:02:21,922 --> 00:02:25,682
From there we'll be going on
to Laura Palmer's funeral.

3
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:42,190
Good morning, Colonel Cooper.

4
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:46,076
Just Agent, Audrey. Special Agent.

5
00:02:46,076 --> 00:02:47,964
Special Agent.

6
00:02:49,346 --> 00:02:52,557
Would you care to join me
for breakfast?

7
00:02:53,652 --> 00:02:56,326
I'm in a hurry.
- For what?

8
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,417
Audrey, that perfume you're wearing
is incredible.

9
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,099
Do you really think so?
- Yes, I do. Please, have a seat.

10
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:11,574
And would you write your name down
for me? Here.

11
00:03:12,504 --> 00:03:13,254
OK.

12
00:03:24,501 --> 00:03:27,592
Audrey, there's something
you'd like to tell me.

13
00:03:27,592 --> 00:03:29,757
There is?

14
00:03:29,757 --> 00:03:34,398
You slipped this note underneath
my door the night before last.

15
00:03:34,398 --> 00:03:35,118
I did?

16
00:03:40,427 --> 00:03:42,970
I wanted to help you. For Laura.

17
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,778
You said you and Laura
weren't exactly friends.

18
00:03:45,778 --> 00:03:50,033
We weren't friends, but I
understood her better than the rest.

19
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:54,304
What is "One-Eyed Jacks?"
- It's a place up north.

20
00:03:54,304 --> 00:03:57,266
Men go there.
- What about women?

21
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:03,950
Women... you know, work there.

22
00:04:04,547 --> 00:04:06,377
Did Laura work there?

23
00:04:07,264 --> 00:04:11,983
I don't know. Laura worked
at my father's department store.

24
00:04:11,983 --> 00:04:15,120
Horne's?
- He named it after himself.

25
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,079
Where at Horne's department store?

26
00:04:19,595 --> 00:04:22,639
At the perfume counter.

27
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,613
So did Ronnette Pulaski.
- Really?

28
00:04:26,534 --> 00:04:31,207
The rightward slant in your handwriting
indicates a romantic nature.

29
00:04:31,207 --> 00:04:34,141
A heart that yearns. Be careful.

30
00:04:36,066 --> 00:04:37,942
I do?

31
00:04:43,672 --> 00:04:47,976
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave now. Police business.

32
00:04:51,197 --> 00:04:53,824
Thank you for talking to me.

33
00:05:01,438 --> 00:05:03,316
Trudy, two more coffees, please.

34
00:05:03,316 --> 00:05:05,698
Harry, Lucy...

35
00:05:05,698 --> 00:05:09,620
It is an absolutely beautiful morning.

36
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,424
Griddlecakes, melted butter, maple
syrup, lightly heated, slice of ham.

37
00:05:13,327 --> 00:05:17,767
Nothing beats the taste sensation
when maple syrup collides with ham.

38
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:20,438
Griddlecakes, slice of ham.

39
00:05:20,438 --> 00:05:22,531
Who killed Laura Palmer?

40
00:05:27,467 --> 00:05:30,308
Let me tell you about the dream
I had last night.

41
00:05:30,308 --> 00:05:32,521
Tibet?
- No.

42
00:05:32,521 --> 00:05:35,361
You were there. Lucy, so were you.

43
00:05:35,361 --> 00:05:39,243
Harry, my dream is a code
waiting to be broken.

44
00:05:39,243 --> 00:05:41,959
Break the code, solve the crime.

45
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:46,562
"Break the code, solve the crime."

46
00:05:47,657 --> 00:05:50,950
In my dream, Sarah Palmer
has a vision of her daughter's killer.

47
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,040
Deputy Hawk sketched his picture.

48
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,432
I got a phone call from
a one-armed man named Mike.

49
00:05:56,432 --> 00:05:59,319
The killer's name was Bob.
- Mike and Bobby?

50
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:01,733
No, it's a different Mike
and a different Bob.

51
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:04,449
They lived above
a convenience store.

52
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:10,395
They had a tattoo,
"Fire, walk with me".

53
00:06:10,395 --> 00:06:13,655
Mike couldn't stand the killing
any more, so he cut off his arm.

54
00:06:13,655 --> 00:06:16,452
Bob vowed to kill again,
so Mike shot him.

55
00:06:16,452 --> 00:06:20,425
Do you know
where dreams come from?

56
00:06:20,425 --> 00:06:22,516
Not specifically.
- No.

57
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:27,780
Acetylcholine neurons fire
high-voltage impulses into the forebrain.

58
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,091
These impulses become pictures,
the pictures become dreams, but...

59
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:35,183
no one knows why we choose
these particular pictures.

60
00:06:35,183 --> 00:06:38,188
So what was the end of this dream?

61
00:06:38,188 --> 00:06:42,535
Suddenly, it was 25 years later.
I was old, sitting in a red room.

62
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:45,003
There was a midget in a red suit
and a beautiful woman.

63
00:06:45,003 --> 00:06:48,183
The midget told me that my favourite
gum was coming back into style,

64
00:06:48,183 --> 00:06:52,109
and didn't his cousin look exactly
like Laura Palmer, which she did.

65
00:06:52,109 --> 00:06:54,695
What cousin?
- The beautiful woman.

66
00:06:54,695 --> 00:06:57,334
She's filled with secrets.

67
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,629
Sometimes her arms bend back.

68
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:02,094
Where she's from,
the birds sing a pretty song

69
00:07:02,094 --> 00:07:05,696
and there's always music in the air.
The midget did a dance.

70
00:07:05,696 --> 00:07:09,963
Laura kissed me and she whispered
the name of the killer in my ear.

71
00:07:10,842 --> 00:07:14,467
Who was it?
- I don't remember.

72
00:07:15,106 --> 00:07:18,028
Damn!
- Damn!

73
00:07:18,028 --> 00:07:21,206
Harry, our job is simple:
break the code, solve the crime.

74
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:24,540
Yeah?

75
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,597
Sheriff, I'm at the morgue
and there's a big fight going on.

76
00:07:27,597 --> 00:07:29,774
Youhang on, I'll be right there.

77
00:07:29,774 --> 00:07:33,202
That was Andy.
There's a fight over at the morgue.

78
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,538
Albert.

79
00:07:35,435 --> 00:07:37,313
You're the most cold-blooded man
I've ever seen.

80
00:07:37,313 --> 00:07:41,365
I've never known such little regard for
human frailty. Have you no compassion?

81
00:07:41,365 --> 00:07:45,841
I've got compassion running out of
my nose. I'm the Sultan of Sentiment.

82
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:48,222
Doctor Hayward,
I have travelled thousands of miles

83
00:07:48,222 --> 00:07:51,027
and apparently several centuries
to this forgotten sinkhole

84
00:07:51,027 --> 00:07:52,864
to perform a series of tests.

85
00:07:52,864 --> 00:07:55,869
I do not ask you to understand
these tests. I'm not cruel.

86
00:07:55,869 --> 00:07:59,502
I just ask you to get out,
so I can finish my work!

87
00:07:59,502 --> 00:08:02,141
We are here to conduct
Laura Palmer's body to the cemetery.

88
00:08:02,141 --> 00:08:05,856
If you think we're gonna leave
without her, you are crazy!

89
00:08:05,856 --> 00:08:08,078
All right, all right, all right!

90
00:08:09,795 --> 00:08:11,424
Mr Rosenfield, please.

91
00:08:15,146 --> 00:08:19,783
Leland Palmer couldn't be
with us today,

92
00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:23,454
but I know I speak for everyone,
the Palmer family included,

93
00:08:23,454 --> 00:08:29,648
when I say that we appreciate and
understand the value of your work.

94
00:08:29,648 --> 00:08:34,033
But, as their representative,
I must insist

95
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:38,130
that we consider the feelings
of the Palmer family as well.

96
00:08:39,307 --> 00:08:43,148
Mr Horne, I realise that your position
in this fair community

97
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:46,452
pretty well guarantees venality,
insincerity

98
00:08:46,452 --> 00:08:49,202
and a rather irritating method
of expressing yourself.

99
00:08:49,202 --> 00:08:52,764
Stupidity, however,
is not a necessarily inherent trait.

100
00:08:52,764 --> 00:08:57,612
Therefore, please listen closely.
You can have a funeral any old time.

101
00:08:57,612 --> 00:08:59,662
You dig a hole, you plant a coffin.

102
00:08:59,662 --> 00:09:02,917
I, however, cannot perform
these tests next year,

103
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:07,515
next month, next week or tomorrow.
I must perform them now.

104
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,904
I've got a lot of cutting
and pasting to do, so please,

105
00:09:10,904 --> 00:09:14,417
why don't you return to your
porch rockers and resume whittling?

106
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:18,677
That does it. I'm taking charge of
the body and you don't touch Laura...

107
00:09:18,677 --> 00:09:20,557
What the hell
do you think you're doing?!

108
00:09:20,557 --> 00:09:23,068
Gentlemen.
- What's going on?

109
00:09:23,068 --> 00:09:25,029
Thank God!

110
00:09:26,335 --> 00:09:29,460
This old fool is obstructing
a criminal investigation. Cuff him!

111
00:09:29,678 --> 00:09:32,471
He won't release Laura's body
for the funeral. He's not human.

112
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,982
What's the hold-up?
- Please, Cooper.

113
00:09:34,982 --> 00:09:38,489
I do not suffer fools gladly,
and fools with badges, never.

114
00:09:38,489 --> 00:09:42,173
I want no interference
from this hulking boob. Is that clear?

115
00:09:42,173 --> 00:09:44,591
I've had just about enough
of your insults.

116
00:09:44,811 --> 00:09:46,557
Oh, yeah?

117
00:09:46,557 --> 00:09:50,192
Well, I've had about enough of
morons and half-wits,

118
00:09:50,192 --> 00:09:53,164
dolts, dunces,
dullards and dumbbells.

119
00:09:53,164 --> 00:09:56,013
And you chowderhead yokel,
you blithering hayseed,

120
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:58,431
you've had enough of me?

121
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,477
Yes, I have.

122
00:10:06,088 --> 00:10:08,250
That's nice. How appropriate.

123
00:10:09,807 --> 00:10:11,768
Wait in the car, Harry.

124
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,627
The old rustic sucker punch, huh?
A hail of bullets would be nice.

125
00:10:21,627 --> 00:10:25,014
That's enough.
The sheriff didn't mean anything.

126
00:10:25,014 --> 00:10:28,947
He hit me.
- Well, I'm sure he meant to do that.

127
00:10:28,947 --> 00:10:32,251
Albert, release this girl's body
to her family immediately.

128
00:10:32,251 --> 00:10:36,094
I want your test results by noon.
Those are orders.

129
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:46,292
Thank you, Agent Cooper.

130
00:11:12,718 --> 00:11:14,846
Invitation to love

131
00:11:14,846 --> 00:11:19,405
Starring Martin Hadley as Chet...

132
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,833
Selena Swift as Emerald and Jade...

133
00:11:26,346 --> 00:11:30,138
Evan St Vincent as Jared Lancaster...

134
00:11:31,403 --> 00:11:35,111
and Jason Denbo as Montana.

135
00:11:38,635 --> 00:11:43,354
My darling daughter Jade... and Emerald.

136
00:11:43,354 --> 00:11:48,829
Because of my financial difficulties,
I have decided to end it all tonight.

137
00:11:48,829 --> 00:11:53,472
I hope you can find the strength to
go on without me. Your loving father...

138
00:11:53,472 --> 00:11:55,769
Uncle Leland?

139
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,152
Uncle Leland?

140
00:12:03,215 --> 00:12:04,925
Madeleine?

141
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:10,276
Jade, what a surprise.

142
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:22,484
Maddy? Is it you?

143
00:12:24,741 --> 00:12:26,620
Uncle Leland...

144
00:12:28,044 --> 00:12:31,218
I am so sorry.

145
00:12:49,148 --> 00:12:53,950
I'm sure Hank appreciates
your unwavering devotion.

146
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,124
Your husband has been
a model prisoner,

147
00:12:56,124 --> 00:12:59,506
an inspiration to guard
and inmate alike.

148
00:12:59,506 --> 00:13:01,477
He greets the day with a smile

149
00:13:01,477 --> 00:13:04,280
and confounds adversity
with a kind word.

150
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:07,695
Hank's parole hearing
is scheduled for tomorrow.

151
00:13:07,695 --> 00:13:10,453
Barring unforeseen circumstance,

152
00:13:10,453 --> 00:13:13,515
with your full support
before the board,

153
00:13:13,515 --> 00:13:16,646
he could be released
shortly thereafter.

154
00:13:17,615 --> 00:13:19,696
Any questions?

155
00:13:19,696 --> 00:13:20,446
No.

156
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:27,515
Will you help find the job that Hank
needs to effect successful parole?

157
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,019
Yes.
- How exactly?

158
00:13:32,203 --> 00:13:35,496
I own the RR Mr Mooney.

159
00:13:36,843 --> 00:13:38,555
You're quite a girl, Norma.

160
00:13:38,555 --> 00:13:43,486
I'll bet you get all kinds of Romeos
in here begging for favours.

161
00:13:43,486 --> 00:13:45,363
How do you keep them
from your door?

162
00:13:45,363 --> 00:13:48,962
I usually tell them I have
a homicidally jealous husband

163
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:51,510
who's doing 3-5 for manslaughter.

164
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:56,192
But he expects to be a productive
member of society real soon.

165
00:13:57,701 --> 00:14:00,829
That should conclude our session
for today, Mrs Jennings.

166
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,640
Look at that!

167
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,857
Ducks on the lake!

168
00:14:07,857 --> 00:14:11,536
So fill me in on Leo Johnson.

169
00:14:11,536 --> 00:14:14,335
Leo's one of those guys
you keep your eye on.

170
00:14:14,335 --> 00:14:18,764
So far, we haven't caught him
with his paws in the cookie jar.

171
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:21,856
Morning, Leo.

172
00:14:23,537 --> 00:14:24,999
Who the hell is he?

173
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:28,383
This is Special Agent Cooper, FBI.

174
00:14:28,383 --> 00:14:31,138
We'd like to ask you
a couple of questions.

175
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:31,978
So ask.

176
00:14:34,531 --> 00:14:36,778
"Leo". Is that short for "Leonard"?

177
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:39,286
That's a question?

178
00:14:41,176 --> 00:14:44,220
Did you know Laura Palmer?
- No.

179
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,646
How well did you know her?
- I said I didn't.

180
00:14:47,646 --> 00:14:49,445
You're lying.

181
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:53,166
I knew who she was, all right?
Everybody did.

182
00:14:55,055 --> 00:14:58,646
Do youhave a criminal record?
- Nothing. Youcan look it up.

183
00:14:58,646 --> 00:15:00,564
Illegal U-turn, April 1986.

184
00:15:00,564 --> 00:15:02,446
Drunk and disorderly,
November 1987.

185
00:15:02,446 --> 00:15:06,841
September '88, aggravated assault,
charges dropped.

186
00:15:06,841 --> 00:15:10,137
I paid my debt to society.

187
00:15:10,137 --> 00:15:14,534
Where were you the night of Laura
Palmer's murder? Around midnight?

188
00:15:14,534 --> 00:15:18,666
On the road. I called my wife Shelly
from Butte, Montana.

189
00:15:19,301 --> 00:15:22,142
She'll confirm this?
- If you ask her.

190
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,107
Robert?

191
00:15:40,986 --> 00:15:43,566
This may be a good time
for a brief discussion.

192
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:49,421
You want to talk about cigarettes?
Today?

193
00:15:50,727 --> 00:15:55,114
No, but put it out. It's a filthy habit,
especially for a varsity athlete.

194
00:16:08,828 --> 00:16:13,464
I've attended my share of funerals.
Too many.

195
00:16:13,464 --> 00:16:17,592
Any time a man dies in war,
he dies too soon.

196
00:16:18,608 --> 00:16:20,902
Laura died too soon as well.

197
00:16:21,912 --> 00:16:24,074
Yeah, she did.

198
00:16:25,172 --> 00:16:28,178
But we have a responsibility
to the dead, Robert.

199
00:16:28,178 --> 00:16:31,439
Responsibility is the linchpin
of our society.

200
00:16:31,439 --> 00:16:33,606
Each man responsible
for his own actions,

201
00:16:33,606 --> 00:16:36,826
each action contributing
to the greater good.

202
00:16:37,961 --> 00:16:42,052
What's the good of putting someone
in the ground?

203
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:46,653
That's man's way of achieving closure.

204
00:16:46,653 --> 00:16:49,029
In ceremony begins understanding

205
00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:52,874
and the will to carry on
without those we must leave behind.

206
00:16:52,874 --> 00:16:57,191
In your life, you must learn, you
will learn, to carry on without them.

207
00:16:58,362 --> 00:16:59,942
Great.

208
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:05,341
I realise you experience
an ongoing disinclination

209
00:17:05,341 --> 00:17:08,642
to enter fully into
meaningful exchange.

210
00:17:08,642 --> 00:17:11,232
This leads to stalemate

211
00:17:11,232 --> 00:17:15,707
and a desire on my part to force
certain wisdom upon you.

212
00:17:15,707 --> 00:17:17,748
This isn't necessarily a bad thing,

213
00:17:17,748 --> 00:17:21,140
sometimes it's
the best course available.

214
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,395
Son, don't be afraid.

215
00:17:25,395 --> 00:17:28,249
We'll all be there together.

216
00:17:29,713 --> 00:17:32,755
Afraid of what?
- Well, the funeral.

217
00:17:34,978 --> 00:17:38,606
I'm not afraid of any damn funeral.

218
00:17:38,606 --> 00:17:40,245
Afraid?

219
00:17:43,005 --> 00:17:46,179
I can hardly wait.

220
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:48,227
Afraid?!

221
00:17:48,227 --> 00:17:51,489
I'm gonna turn it upside down!

222
00:17:52,579 --> 00:17:54,574
Everybody ready?

223
00:18:03,194 --> 00:18:04,472
Deputy Hawk.

224
00:18:04,572 --> 00:18:07,991
Agent Cooper, there's no sign
of the man with one arm.

225
00:18:07,991 --> 00:18:10,587
Keep trying.
He's out there somewhere.

226
00:18:11,972 --> 00:18:13,885
If anyone can find him, Hawk can.

227
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:16,355
He's a tracker?
- The best.

228
00:18:18,111 --> 00:18:20,108
OK, Albert.
What have you got?

229
00:18:20,108 --> 00:18:22,412
Enough forensic spadework
to save your butt

230
00:18:22,412 --> 00:18:24,996
and get mine out of
this godforsaken burg.

231
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:30,185
What have you got?

232
00:18:30,185 --> 00:18:35,195
OK, first of all, contents of envelope
found in Palmer diary: cocaine.

233
00:18:35,195 --> 00:18:37,252
Toxicology results also positive.

234
00:18:37,252 --> 00:18:40,382
Newsflash: the little lady had a habit.

235
00:18:40,382 --> 00:18:43,482
We've got fibres of twine embedded
in her wrists and upper arms.

236
00:18:43,482 --> 00:18:46,278
Two different kinds of twine.

237
00:18:46,278 --> 00:18:50,327
Fibres of twine found in railroad car
matched the sample from her wrist.

238
00:18:50,327 --> 00:18:53,003
The same twine was used
to bind the Pulaski girl.

239
00:18:53,003 --> 00:18:57,563
Conclusion: she was tied up twice, at
different locations, the night she died.

240
00:18:57,563 --> 00:19:01,322
Once here, once here. Like this.

241
00:19:01,917 --> 00:19:04,629
"Sometimes my arms bend back."

242
00:19:05,722 --> 00:19:09,312
We found traces of pumice in
standing water outside the railroad car.

243
00:19:09,312 --> 00:19:11,314
Soap, industrial strength.

244
00:19:11,314 --> 00:19:15,706
I found identical particles on Laura's
neck. It's not her home-use brand.

245
00:19:15,706 --> 00:19:19,506
My conclusion:
the killer washed his hands

246
00:19:19,506 --> 00:19:23,018
and then leaned in for a kiss.
Like this.

247
00:19:24,072 --> 00:19:25,821
Good Lord...

248
00:19:28,044 --> 00:19:31,136
Distinctive wounds found
on Laura's neck and shoulder

249
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:35,061
appear to be claw marks,
bites of some kind.

250
00:19:35,903 --> 00:19:37,234
An animal?

251
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,036
Look, it's trying to think.

252
00:19:44,805 --> 00:19:47,480
Finally, a small plastic fragment
from her stomach,

253
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:52,119
partially dissolved by digestive acids.
I'm taking it back for reconstruction,

254
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:55,504
as the local facilities give
new meaning to the word "primitive".

255
00:19:55,504 --> 00:19:59,056
I note with some interest
what appears to be the letter "J".

256
00:20:00,941 --> 00:20:02,190
Good work, Albert.

257
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,899
A couple more days, who knows
what I might have found?

258
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:07,368
Sheriff? It's time.

259
00:20:09,427 --> 00:20:13,267
Excuse us. We have got
a funeral to get to.

260
00:20:18,832 --> 00:20:21,411
Cooper, may I have
a word with you alone?

261
00:20:24,894 --> 00:20:28,982
There's also a report concerning
the physical assault on me this morning.

262
00:20:28,982 --> 00:20:32,825
I think you'll find it's quite accurate.
Requires your signature.

263
00:20:34,675 --> 00:20:37,171
Albert, I'm not going to sign this.

264
00:20:37,171 --> 00:20:38,598
What?

265
00:20:39,774 --> 00:20:45,207
Albert, I hope you can hear me. I've
only been in Twin Peaks a short time.

266
00:20:45,207 --> 00:20:49,043
But in that time I have seen decency,
honour and dignity.

267
00:20:49,043 --> 00:20:51,265
Murder is not a faceless event here.

268
00:20:51,265 --> 00:20:54,814
It is not a statistic
to be tallied up at the end of the day.

269
00:20:54,814 --> 00:20:58,699
Laura Palmer's death has affected
every man, woman and child

270
00:20:58,699 --> 00:21:00,959
because life has meaning here,
every life.

271
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:04,179
That's a way of living I thought
had vanished, but it hasn't.

272
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,600
It's right here in Twin Peaks.

273
00:21:08,283 --> 00:21:11,910
Sounds like you've been snacking
on some of the local mushrooms.

274
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:14,251
With your behaviour
towards these good people,

275
00:21:14,251 --> 00:21:17,007
you're lucky
I do not file a report

276
00:21:17,007 --> 00:21:21,318
that could bury youso deep in
Washington you'd never see the sun.

277
00:21:32,365 --> 00:21:34,659
Diane, it's 12:27 pm.

278
00:21:35,751 --> 00:21:40,424
Look into my pension plan options
on outside real estate investment.

279
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:43,524
I may purchase a piece of property
at what I assume

280
00:21:43,524 --> 00:21:46,570
will be a very reasonable price.

281
00:22:18,192 --> 00:22:20,235
Love me?

282
00:22:20,235 --> 00:22:22,243
You bet.

283
00:22:24,336 --> 00:22:26,084
This a new one?

284
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,596
Yes.

285
00:22:30,147 --> 00:22:32,477
Isn't it beautiful?

286
00:22:37,087 --> 00:22:39,167
How do I look?

287
00:22:41,976 --> 00:22:45,898
Well, you look fine, Nadine.
- Oh, Ed!

288
00:22:46,993 --> 00:22:50,000
Last night was wonderful.

289
00:22:51,214 --> 00:22:56,183
Oh, my darling Ed,
you came back to me.

290
00:22:56,857 --> 00:23:00,864
Now I feel like we're
really together again.

291
00:23:11,655 --> 00:23:14,616
In high school,

292
00:23:14,616 --> 00:23:21,556
I used to watch Norma and you
at those football games.

293
00:23:21,556 --> 00:23:25,022
She was so pretty.

294
00:23:25,022 --> 00:23:28,284
You made such a handsome couple.

295
00:23:29,714 --> 00:23:31,342
But I knew...

296
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:34,262
even though...

297
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,069
I was just...

298
00:23:38,366 --> 00:23:40,743
a little nobody...

299
00:23:42,128 --> 00:23:47,015
just a little brown mouse...

300
00:23:50,655 --> 00:23:53,533
I always knew inside...

301
00:23:55,546 --> 00:23:58,258
once you got to know me...

302
00:24:00,103 --> 00:24:03,480
we'd be together forever.

303
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:10,381
That's not your bike, is it, Ed?

304
00:24:10,381 --> 00:24:12,634
It's James.

305
00:24:14,566 --> 00:24:16,647
James who?

306
00:24:30,493 --> 00:24:34,416
We don't want to be late. Ready?
- I'm not going.

307
00:24:35,383 --> 00:24:37,179
It's Laura, James.

308
00:24:37,179 --> 00:24:41,902
I can't. I just can't.
- James!

309
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,714
I don't care what the doctor says.

310
00:24:49,714 --> 00:24:53,307
If you keep indulging him,
he is never going to change.

311
00:24:53,307 --> 00:24:56,314
I don't think we should discuss this
while Johnny is here.

312
00:24:56,314 --> 00:25:00,246
Johnny doesn't know what day it is.
- We have to be patient, Ben.

313
00:25:00,461 --> 00:25:05,098
You be patient. I have waited 20 years
for some sign of intelligent life.

314
00:25:11,459 --> 00:25:13,706
I'm clear about this, Sylvia.
I have my limits.

315
00:25:13,706 --> 00:25:15,470
Don't I know it?

316
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:18,433
Fine, let's all spray venom
in my general direction.

317
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:22,952
You take it with no problem.
- Taking it is a speciality of the house.

318
00:25:22,952 --> 00:25:26,830
Sylvia, I'm gonna make it
extremely simple for you.

319
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:30,350
We can't take Johnny to the funeral
in that ridiculous getup.

320
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:34,823
Then let the great Doctor Jacoby
see what he can do.

321
00:25:34,823 --> 00:25:37,074
You do it then.

322
00:25:37,074 --> 00:25:39,164
Am I going to have to call
Doctor Jacoby

323
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:43,048
every damn time I have
a problem with Johnny?

324
00:25:55,810 --> 00:26:00,946
Thank God. All right, let's everyone
just get into the car.

325
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:20,402
I am the Resurrection and the Life.

326
00:26:20,402 --> 00:26:23,371
He that believeth in me,
though he were dead,

327
00:26:23,371 --> 00:26:26,047
yet shall he live.

328
00:26:26,047 --> 00:26:29,263
And whosoever liveth
and believeth in me

329
00:26:29,263 --> 00:26:31,519
shall never die.

330
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:33,699
For none of us liveth to himself

331
00:26:33,699 --> 00:26:36,497
and no man dieth to himself.

332
00:26:37,297 --> 00:26:40,639
For, if we live, we live unto the Lord

333
00:26:40,639 --> 00:26:44,315
and, if we die, we die unto the Lord.

334
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:50,249
Whether we live, therefore, or we die,
we are the Lord's.

335
00:26:50,249 --> 00:26:54,055
Blessed be the dead
who die in the Lord.

336
00:26:54,055 --> 00:27:00,029
Even so saith the Spirit,
for they rest from their labours.

337
00:27:00,029 --> 00:27:02,077
The Lord be with thee.

338
00:27:03,424 --> 00:27:05,086
Let us pray.

339
00:27:07,018 --> 00:27:12,618
O, God, entrust this child Laura
to Thy never-failing care and love

340
00:27:12,618 --> 00:27:15,580
and bring us all
to Thy heavenly kingdom

341
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:18,924
through the same, Thy son,
Jesus Christ, our Lord,

342
00:27:18,924 --> 00:27:23,237
who liveth and reigneth with Thee,
and the Holy Spirit,

343
00:27:23,237 --> 00:27:27,626
one God, now and forever. Amen.

344
00:27:28,712 --> 00:27:32,172
I baptised Laura Palmer.

345
00:27:32,172 --> 00:27:36,606
I instructed her in Sunday school.

346
00:27:36,606 --> 00:27:41,003
And l, like the rest of you, came to
love her with that special love

347
00:27:41,003 --> 00:27:46,260
that we reserve for the headstrong
and the bold.

348
00:27:47,943 --> 00:27:49,688
Laura was bright.

349
00:27:51,287 --> 00:27:54,828
She was beautiful, she was charming.

350
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:01,062
But most of all Laura was,
I think, impatient.

351
00:28:01,062 --> 00:28:04,279
She was impatient for her life
to begin,

352
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:09,460
for the world to finally catch up
to her dreams and ambitions.

353
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,139
Laura used to say that I talk too much.

354
00:28:12,139 --> 00:28:15,354
I'll not make that mistake today.

355
00:28:15,354 --> 00:28:19,538
Just let it be said that I loved her

356
00:28:19,538 --> 00:28:22,970
and I will miss her
the rest of my days.

357
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,220
Amen!

358
00:28:26,065 --> 00:28:27,943
Amen!

359
00:28:31,383 --> 00:28:32,667
Thank you, Johnny.

360
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:33,917
Amen!

361
00:28:42,651 --> 00:28:44,780
What are you looking at?

362
00:28:46,372 --> 00:28:48,453
What are you waiting for?

363
00:28:49,967 --> 00:28:52,213
You make me sick.

364
00:28:52,213 --> 00:28:55,357
You damn hypocrites make me sick!

365
00:28:56,864 --> 00:29:00,240
Everybody knew she was in trouble,

366
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,794
but we didn't do anything.

367
00:29:04,263 --> 00:29:06,427
All you good people...

368
00:29:08,026 --> 00:29:10,188
You wanna know who killed Laura?

369
00:29:10,188 --> 00:29:12,237
You did!

370
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,796
We all did.

371
00:29:17,597 --> 00:29:21,473
And pretty words aren't gonna bring
her back, man, so save your prayers.

372
00:29:21,473 --> 00:29:24,571
She would've laughed at them
anyway.

373
00:29:31,768 --> 00:29:34,811
You are dead, man! You're dead!

374
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:41,842
That's enough, Bobby. That's enough!

375
00:29:45,187 --> 00:29:48,563
You are dead!

376
00:29:50,662 --> 00:29:52,076
Get off me!

377
00:29:52,961 --> 00:29:54,959
You are dead, man. Dead!

378
00:29:57,057 --> 00:30:00,185
You are dead, man. God... Dead!

379
00:30:02,743 --> 00:30:04,704
Get off me!

380
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:11,101
Ah, my baby. Laura!

381
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:15,988
Laura! Laura!

382
00:30:15,988 --> 00:30:17,872
Lee, hang on.

383
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,603
The whole thing has gone haywire.

384
00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:31,459
Don't ruin this, too!

385
00:30:36,602 --> 00:30:38,313
My baby!

386
00:30:39,151 --> 00:30:39,871
Laura!

387
00:30:46,467 --> 00:30:47,187
Laura!

388
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,590
Here's the father
and this is his daughter in the coffin.

389
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:26,007
I'm telling you, Harry,
he's just not gonna figure this out.

390
00:31:26,007 --> 00:31:29,978
Ed, that's a bet I'll take. For the check.

391
00:31:29,978 --> 00:31:32,111
He's right on time.

392
00:31:32,111 --> 00:31:34,659
Harry, careful who you trust.
He's just not one of us.

393
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,836
Cooper, take a seat.

394
00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:41,139
Harry, I got your note.
Hawk. Big Ed.

395
00:31:41,139 --> 00:31:45,574
How would you like
some fresh huckleberry pie?

396
00:31:46,626 --> 00:31:50,680
I would love a slice of pie.
Norma, slice of huckleberry pie, heated.

397
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,933
Vanilla ice cream, coffee.
- Coming right up.

398
00:31:57,285 --> 00:32:00,376
Big Ed, how long have you been
in love with Norma?

399
00:32:05,561 --> 00:32:08,689
Ed, looks like pie and coffee's on you.

400
00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:15,129
What did you call me in for
besides the highlights of the menu?

401
00:32:15,129 --> 00:32:16,848
You'd better tell him.

402
00:32:16,848 --> 00:32:20,982
Somebody's running drugs into
Twin Peaks from across the border.

403
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:25,660
We've tried for six months to set up a bust,
top to bottom. Nobody walks.

404
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,755
Who's targeted?
- Jacques Renault.

405
00:32:27,755 --> 00:32:31,183
Bartender at the Roadhouse.
We figure him for the middle man.

406
00:32:31,486 --> 00:32:33,312
Ed's been doing some undercover.

407
00:32:33,312 --> 00:32:36,455
The night you got into town,
he was staking Renault out.

408
00:32:36,313 --> 00:32:38,437
We think Renault slipped him
a mickey.

409
00:32:38,437 --> 00:32:40,865
Felt like being hit with a log splitter.

410
00:32:40,865 --> 00:32:44,254
I didn't know you were a deputy.
- He's not.

411
00:32:45,361 --> 00:32:48,202
It's a little outside your jurisdiction.

412
00:32:48,202 --> 00:32:50,865
Somebody's selling drugs
to high school kids.

413
00:32:50,865 --> 00:32:53,084
That's everybody's jurisdiction.

414
00:32:53,084 --> 00:32:57,357
I call Ed in when I need him.
He's not the only one I called.

415
00:33:02,499 --> 00:33:05,376
Thanks, Norma.
- Enjoy.

416
00:33:09,899 --> 00:33:13,441
This must be where pies go
when they die.

417
00:33:16,085 --> 00:33:20,923
OK, Harry, would you please tell me
why you really called me in here?

418
00:33:21,143 --> 00:33:24,602
Go along with me on this,
even if it sounds a little weird.

419
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:27,572
I'm with you.
- Twin Peaks is different.

420
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:29,575
A long way from the world.
You've noticed that.

421
00:33:29,575 --> 00:33:33,670
Yes, I have.
- That's exactly the way we like it.

422
00:33:33,953 --> 00:33:39,554
But there's a back end to that
that's kind of different, too.

423
00:33:39,554 --> 00:33:42,063
Maybe that's the price we pay
for the good things.

424
00:33:42,063 --> 00:33:46,152
What would that be?
- There's a sort of evil out there.

425
00:33:47,452 --> 00:33:51,674
Something very, very strange
in these old woods.

426
00:33:51,674 --> 00:33:55,895
Call it what you want.
A darkness. A presence.

427
00:33:55,895 --> 00:33:57,894
It takes many forms,

428
00:33:57,894 --> 00:34:02,285
but it's been out there for as long
as anyone can remember.

429
00:34:02,285 --> 00:34:06,555
We've always been here to fight it.
- We?

430
00:34:06,555 --> 00:34:11,935
Men before us. Men before them.

431
00:34:11,935 --> 00:34:16,168
More after we're gone.
- A secret society.

432
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:20,389
Why don't we take Agent Cooper
for a little ride?

433
00:34:21,144 --> 00:34:24,937
Where to?
- The Bookhouse.

434
00:34:35,189 --> 00:34:37,733
This is where we get together.

435
00:34:37,733 --> 00:34:43,376
Going on 20 years now.
- "We" meaning...?

436
00:34:43,376 --> 00:34:45,844
The Bookhouse Boys.

437
00:34:45,844 --> 00:34:49,018
Coffee's free.
- Like the sound of that.

438
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:55,871
Cooper, you know James.

439
00:34:55,871 --> 00:34:58,337
Agent Cooper.
- James.

440
00:34:58,337 --> 00:35:01,434
This is Joey Paulson.
- Joey.

441
00:35:01,434 --> 00:35:04,950
Who's this?
- Bernard Renault, Jacques' brother.

442
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:07,795
Janitor at the Roadhouse.

443
00:35:07,795 --> 00:35:12,973
Bernard came across the border this
morning with an ounce of cocaine.

444
00:35:12,973 --> 00:35:15,945
Thought we'd ask him
a few questions.

445
00:35:20,042 --> 00:35:24,299
Did you sell drugs to Laura Palmer?
- I don't sell drugs.

446
00:35:24,299 --> 00:35:26,678
How much does Jacques pay you
to be the mule?

447
00:35:26,678 --> 00:35:30,232
Jacques don't pay me nothing.
I'm no mule.

448
00:35:30,232 --> 00:35:34,498
So that ounce was for personal use?
- That's right.

449
00:35:34,498 --> 00:35:37,347
I guess you don't get much sleep
at night, Bernie.

450
00:35:37,347 --> 00:35:40,440
Your brother didn't come to work
the last few days. Where's he been?

451
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,067
I don't know.
He got personal business.

452
00:35:44,067 --> 00:35:47,544
Who else is he dealing with?
- Why don't you ask him?

453
00:35:47,544 --> 00:35:50,051
He'll be back tonight. Any minute.

454
00:35:50,051 --> 00:35:54,064
To work at the Roadhouse?
- He's the bartender, isn't he?

455
00:35:54,064 --> 00:35:57,493
Bernard, we've got you tied up
in a chair.

456
00:35:57,493 --> 00:36:01,718
You're mixed up with your brother
in a wide variety of felonies.

457
00:36:01,718 --> 00:36:06,350
Why in the world would you tell us
where and when to find him?

458
00:36:41,024 --> 00:36:43,816
Yeah?
- Leo, it's Jacques.

459
00:36:43,816 --> 00:36:46,368
What's up?
- The light. The bust light's on.

460
00:36:46,368 --> 00:36:48,462
Bernard's in trouble.
- You sure?

461
00:36:48,462 --> 00:36:52,726
I saw it, man. You gotta get me
out of here, Leo. Border run.

462
00:36:52,726 --> 00:36:56,396
Where are you?
- Phone booth by the Cash & Carry.

463
00:36:56,396 --> 00:37:00,747
And I don't like waiting, man.
- Shut up. I'm on my way.

464
00:37:01,758 --> 00:37:02,508
Hi.

465
00:37:07,777 --> 00:37:11,117
Where are you going?
- You don't need to know.

466
00:37:49,544 --> 00:37:53,384
Josie? Josie, what's wrong?

467
00:37:54,124 --> 00:37:55,084
Nothing.

468
00:37:58,355 --> 00:37:59,816
Nothing?

469
00:38:06,923 --> 00:38:09,384
God, you're beautiful.

470
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:22,631
Josie, there is something wrong.

471
00:38:22,631 --> 00:38:25,519
What is it? I want you to tell me.

472
00:38:27,782 --> 00:38:30,492
Something horrible is going
to happen.

473
00:38:31,879 --> 00:38:36,932
They want to hurt me. I know it.
- Who? Who wants to hurt you?

474
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:41,448
Catherine.
Catherine and Benjamin Horne.

475
00:38:45,005 --> 00:38:46,881
What makes you think so?

476
00:38:46,881 --> 00:38:50,180
I heard Catherine on the phone

477
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:53,397
saying I'd never suspect.

478
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:55,571
Just like with Andrew's death.

479
00:38:55,571 --> 00:38:59,879
Andrew's death was an accident.
- Was it?

480
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:02,853
Catherine keeps
the mill account books in her safe.

481
00:39:02,853 --> 00:39:06,146
Two books, different numbers.

482
00:39:08,956 --> 00:39:11,715
Andrew built this years ago.

483
00:39:13,764 --> 00:39:17,186
I don't think Catherine knows
that I know it's here.

484
00:39:20,786 --> 00:39:23,628
Why do you think they have
two sets of books?

485
00:39:23,628 --> 00:39:28,267
The usual reasons would be something
to do with stealing. Maybe worse.

486
00:39:33,869 --> 00:39:36,546
There were two. I saw them.

487
00:39:37,715 --> 00:39:40,843
You believe me, don't you?
- Of course I do.

488
00:39:42,439 --> 00:39:47,362
There's nothing unusual in this one.
- There were two.

489
00:39:47,362 --> 00:39:50,000
I swear, there were two.

490
00:40:05,012 --> 00:40:08,720
Have... have you seen my tackle box?

491
00:40:10,572 --> 00:40:13,948
The next time you and the merry
widow want to take a peak in my safe,

492
00:40:13,948 --> 00:40:16,127
don't go to so much trouble.

493
00:40:16,127 --> 00:40:19,930
Be a man about it, Pete.
Ask me to my face.

494
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:28,622
Maybe I'll check the truck.

495
00:41:03,996 --> 00:41:05,541
Dr Jacoby?

496
00:41:06,546 --> 00:41:08,757
I didn't see you at the funeral today.

497
00:41:11,688 --> 00:41:14,017
I'm a terrible person, Agent Cooper.

498
00:41:15,325 --> 00:41:17,786
I pretend that I'm not.

499
00:41:17,786 --> 00:41:19,295
But I am.

500
00:41:21,218 --> 00:41:26,651
Oh, I sit and listen to their problems.
Day after day.

501
00:41:28,158 --> 00:41:32,211
These people think of me
as their friend.

502
00:41:36,935 --> 00:41:38,767
Truth is, I really don't care.

503
00:41:40,949 --> 00:41:43,362
I thought nothing,

504
00:41:43,362 --> 00:41:47,250
no one could ever reach me again.

505
00:41:52,486 --> 00:41:54,281
Laura changed all that.

506
00:41:59,342 --> 00:42:01,172
I couldn't come today.

507
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:05,433
I just couldn't.

508
00:42:09,165 --> 00:42:11,578
I hope she understands.

509
00:42:14,347 --> 00:42:16,761
I hope she forgives me.

510
00:42:19,029 --> 00:42:20,694
You think it's possible?

511
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,661
You think somebody killed Andrew?

512
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:29,478
I don't know.

513
00:42:31,279 --> 00:42:36,876
I believe what they want is
to take the mill away from me.

514
00:42:38,343 --> 00:42:40,921
For Benjamin to have the land.

515
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:46,532
If it was true with Andrew...

516
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:52,213
you think they'll kill me too?
Think they would?

517
00:42:56,024 --> 00:42:57,438
Josie...

518
00:42:58,825 --> 00:43:02,368
Nothing is gonna happen to you.
Not now, not ever.

519
00:43:02,368 --> 00:43:04,627
Not while I'm around.

520
00:43:51,744 --> 00:43:53,409
Do you believe in the soul?

521
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:56,677
Several.

522
00:43:57,471 --> 00:44:00,645
More than one?
- Blackfoot legend.

523
00:44:00,645 --> 00:44:05,327
Waking souls that give life
to the mind and the body.

524
00:44:05,327 --> 00:44:07,743
A dream soul that wanders.

525
00:44:07,743 --> 00:44:10,257
Dream souls...

526
00:44:10,257 --> 00:44:14,726
Where do they wander?
- Faraway places.

527
00:44:14,726 --> 00:44:16,900
The Land of the Dead.

528
00:44:18,121 --> 00:44:20,451
Is that where Laura is?

529
00:44:20,451 --> 00:44:24,850
Laura is in the ground, Agent Cooper.
That's the only thing I'm sure of.

530
00:44:39,565 --> 00:44:41,562
To Laura.

531
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,907
Godspeed.

532
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:55,235
Will you dance with me?
- Sorry.

533
00:44:55,235 --> 00:44:56,739
Please?

534
00:44:57,749 --> 00:45:00,424
Dance with me? Please?

535
00:45:01,637 --> 00:45:04,216
Dance with me.
- Leave us alone.

536
00:45:04,216 --> 00:45:07,563
Dance with me, please.
Please.

537
00:45:07,563 --> 00:45:09,617
Please.

538
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,375
Somebody dance with me.

539
00:45:19,653 --> 00:45:22,364
Mr Palmer?
- Leland.

540
00:45:33,237 --> 00:45:35,151
Let's take you home.

541
00:45:35,151 --> 00:45:37,206
Home...

542
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:42,511
Home. Home.
