Daddy?

01:23:59,451 --> 01:24:00,451
Lara.

652
01:24:03,788 --> 01:24:05,039
Is this real?

653
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:08,625
It is a crossing...

654
01:24:09,794 --> 01:24:11,920
of my past and your present.

655
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:14,882
Why did you not tell me
about the Illuminati?

656
01:24:15,508 --> 01:24:17,217
You were only a child.

657
01:24:17,302 --> 01:24:19,136
You could have written in yourjournals.

658
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:23,182
-You never mentioned it, not once.
-Lara, I burst to tell you everything.

659
01:24:23,641 --> 01:24:26,018
But in the fierceness
of my own battles...

660
01:24:26,102 --> 01:24:28,896
I strove to tell you
only that which would inspire you...

661
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:30,564
and keep you safe.

662
01:24:31,858 --> 01:24:33,817
I love you so much.

663
01:24:35,153 --> 01:24:36,653
But I've missed you.

664
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:39,823
And I have missed you.

665
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:44,995
I know why you came here...

666
01:24:45,038 --> 01:24:48,332
why you took the power of the light,
but this must not happen.

667
01:24:48,666 --> 01:24:52,211
Why? Why can't we use the power
just this once?

668
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:55,672
Why can't you stay?

669
01:24:56,299 --> 01:24:58,926
We can't change time.

670
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:02,137
But time was stolen from us...

671
01:25:04,516 --> 01:25:06,016
and it's not fair.

672
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:08,685
No, it's not fair.

673
01:25:09,687 --> 01:25:11,772
But you have stolen time itself...

674
01:25:12,482 --> 01:25:14,775
and you must give it back.

675
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:18,862
You must destroy the triangle.

676
01:25:21,032 --> 01:25:22,783
Suddenly I feel so alone.

You're never alone. I am with you
always, just as I've always been.

No.

Wait!

Your father begged for his life...

684
01:27:29,786 --> 01:27:31,745
when we caught him betraying us.

685
01:27:31,829 --> 01:27:34,539
He pleaded like a baby.

686
01:27:34,624 --> 01:27:35,874
Surrender.

687
01:27:38,002 --> 01:27:39,253
Never.

688
01:27:42,799 --> 01:27:47,386
He seemed particularly concerned
that I shouldn't take this.
