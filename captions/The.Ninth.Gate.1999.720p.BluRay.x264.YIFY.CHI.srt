1
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:41,048
It's an impressive collection.
You have some very rare editions here.

2
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,050
Are you sure you
wanna sell them all?

3
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,344
They're no use to
Father, not anymore.

4
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,721
Not since he's been this way.

5
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:52,100
His library was his whole world.
Now it's just a painful memory.

6
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,561
<font color="#808080">WOMAN:</font>
Unbearably painful.

7
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,731
I understand.

8
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:06,323
Well, at a rough preliminary estimate,
you have a collection here...

9
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,325
...worth around $600,000.

10
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,910
Six hundred thousand?

11
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,412
Yes, or thereabouts.

12
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:16,541
I've picked out one or two volumes
that merit special attention.

13
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,586
This Persiles, for
example, is important.

14
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:20,962
I'd hang on to that.

15
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,507
It will never depreciate.
It's a good investment.

16
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,718
- Valuable?
- Very valuable.

17
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:33,600
As for this Hypnerotomachia Di
Poliphili by Colonna, Venice 1545...

18
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,728
...I'm sure I could
find you a buyer.

19
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:40,190
But I wouldn't let the rest
go for less than $500,000...

20
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,776
...under any circumstances.

21
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,112
It may take a month
to place them.

22
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,280
In the meantime, I advise
you to be patient.

23
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,241
- A month?
- Yes, a month or two.

24
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,493
It depends on how much
of a hurry you're in.

25
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,203
You see, more hurry, less money.

26
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:57,040
- Of course.
- Well, that's my advice anyway.

27
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,251
I'm sure you wouldn't
want to rush things...

28
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,795
...but please feel free to
consult another expert.

29
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,464
If you have any questions,
you know where to reach me.

30
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:09,970
Incidentally, this four-volume edition
of Don Quixote is quite nice...

31
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,972
...but not
particularly valuable.

32
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:17,352
Now, I could take it
off your hands...

33
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,896
...right away.

34
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,944
How much were you thinking of?

35
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:29,823
I couldn't go more
than 4000, 4200, tops.

You didn't waste much time.

There's a small fortune
in there, help yourself.

A vulture.

Who isn't, in our business?

42
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,677
You'd stoop to anything.

43
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,679
For a Quixote by Ybarra?
You bet I would.

44
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:56,057
Unscrupulous. Thoroughly
unscrupulous.

00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,875
He's spitting blood.

49

Really?
What's his problem?

50
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,883
He said you're a double-dealing,
money-grubbing bastard.

51
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,261
Thought he had that
deal sewed up.

52
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,263
He said you queered his pitch.

53
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,933
Well, he should've been
quicker off the mark.

54
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,559
May I?

55
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:44,022
Sure. And he said your
evaluation was way over the top.

56
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,858
Got those people
coming out in a rash.

00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,736
Now they're asking twice
what those books are worth.

Fantastic. You are the best.

That client of yours, the Swiss, you
think he'd still be interested in this?

68
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,486
I have Witkin on my ass. I told him
I had no part of this operation.

69
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,363
Except 10 percent.

70

20 percent. The Swiss

78

And earlier, in 1580, in De La
Demonomanie Des Sorciers...

79
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,839
...by the Frenchman, Jean Bodin.

80
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:37,636
Bodin was probably the first to
attempt to establish a system...

81
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:41,890
...if the term 'system' may be
applied to the Middle Ages...

82
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:45,310
...for classifying the
contemporary perceptions of evil.

83
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:50,023
In Bodin, we find one of the first
definitions of the word 'witch. '

84
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,025
And I quote,

85
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:56,655
"A witch is a person who, though
cognizant of the laws of God..."

86
00:10:56,822 --> 00:11:01,159
"...endeavors to act through the
medium of a pact with the devil."

87
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,704
To assist them in their work,
many witches kept familiars.

88
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,707
That is to say, creatures
such as cats or toads...

89
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:12,545
...in which supernatural spirits
or demons were thought to reside.

For those of you ladies and gentlemen
who wish to delve more deeply...

91
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,385
...into the controversial
subject of witchcraft...

92
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:22,597
...a great deal of relevant information
may be found in the following works,

00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,725
Nicolas Remes'
Demonolatria Libri...

94
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:31,064
...and Compendium Maleficarum
by Francesco Maria Guazzo.

I see you were stimulated by
my little talk, Mr. Corso.

96
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,624
- Did I snore?
- Well, it's nice of you to ask.

97
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,794
No. Not that I noticed.

Not, I suspect, that you have

Your kind seldom does.

That makes two of us.

You're right, of course.

Your friendships don't
concern me in the least.

Our relations have always been strictly
commercial and that's the way I like it.

The professional and the personal

They're the rarest, the

Only the supreme

You know your business, but
you're mistaken nonetheless.

According to my own research,
only one is authentic.

Well, three are known.

That's the trouble.

Where'd you get it?

I bought it from Telfer.

153
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:16,289
- Telfer?
- Yes, he finally sold it to me.

The day before he
killed himself.

155

157
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,142
- Silence is golden.
- Precisely.

158
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,937
Ever heard of the Delomelanicon?

159
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,231
I've heard of it, yes.
It's a myth, isn't it?

160
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,817
A book reputed to have been
written by Satan himself.

161
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,110
No myth.

162
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,779
That book existed.

163
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,573
Torchia actually acquired it.

164
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,870
The engravings you are now
admiring were adapted...

165
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,040
...by Torchia from
the Delomelanicon.

166
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,585
They form a kind
of satanic riddle.

167
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:05,421
Correctly interpreted with the
aid of the original text...

168
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,423
...and sufficient
inside information...

169
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:11,928
...they're reputed to conjure up
the prince of darkness in person.

170
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,138
You don't say.

171
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,016
Are you a religious man,
Mr. Corso?

172
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:20,228
I mean, do you believe
in the supernatural?

173
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,439
I believe in my percentage.

174
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,568
Don't you get dizzy
standing there?

175
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,908
What is it that you
want from me, Balkan?

176
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,000
I want you to go to
Europe and investigate.

177
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,585
The other two copies are
in Portugal and France.

178
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:47,672
I want you to find some way
of comparing them with mine.

179
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,967
Every page, every engraving,
the binding, everything.

180
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,886
I'm convinced only one is authentic.
I wanna know which.

181
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,555
That could be an expensive trip.

182
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,475
That's to get you started.

183
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,644
Spend what you need.

184
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,356
What if I find that
your copy's a forgery?

185
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,400
It's quite possible.

186
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,110
Really?

187
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,655
It doesn't appear to be.

188
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,661
- Even the paper sounds kosher.
- Even so.

189
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:22,081
- There's something wrong.
- You mean the devil won't show up?

190
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,546
If all three copies turn out to be bogus
or incomplete your work will be done.

191
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,507
If, on the other hand, one of
them turns out to be genuine...

192
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,092
...I'll finance you further.

193
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,889
I want you to get it for me,
at all costs, never mind how.

194
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,975
- "Never mind how" sounds illegal.
- Wouldn't be the first time...

195
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,769
...you've done
something illegal.

196
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:46,606
- Not that illegal.
- Hence the size of the check.

197
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:54,322
Do a good job, I'll double it.

198
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,495
Gotta be something wrong with it if
you're letting it out of your hands.

199
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,622
I have the utmost faith in you,
Mr. Corso.

200
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,459
Nothing more reliable than a man whose
loyalty can be bought for hard cash.

201
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:09,021
Good morning, I'm Dean Corso.

202
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:13,401
I'm terribly sorry to disturb
you at a time like this.

203
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:27,999
It would be very helpful, ma'am, if
you could tell me what you know...

204
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,209
...about this book.

205
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,929
- Isn't this one of my husband's books?
- Right.

206
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:46,058
It was in his collection until very
recently. He sold it to a client of mine.

207
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,643
I'm trying to authenticate it.

208
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,770
He sold it, you say?

209
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,565
Strange. This was one of his
most treasured possessions.

210
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,609
- He never mentioned the sale?
- No.

211
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,736
It's news to me.

212
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,362
Who bought it?

213
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,656
A private collector.

214
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,200
May I know his name?

215
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,161
I'm afraid that's confidential.

216
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,413
I suppose he has a bill of sale?

217
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,790
- No problem there.
- Is this your job?

218
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,876
Authenticating rare books?

219
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,545
And tracking them down, yes.

220
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,047
You're a book detective.

221
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,924
Kind of.

222
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:22,220
Do you recall when and where
your husband acquired this book?

223
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,224
In Spain.

224
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,768
We were vacationing at Toledo.

225
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,145
Andrew got very excited.

226
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,940
He paid a great deal
of money for it.

227
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,609
He was a fanatical collector.

228
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,736
So I gather.

229
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,239

spend many hours in here.

232
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,558
Too many.

233
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,477
Did he ever try it out?

234
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,146
I don't understand.

The book.

236
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,234
Did he ever use it to perform
some kind of ritual...

237
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:21,487
...intended to produce
a supernatural effect?

238
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,072
Are you serious?

239
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,241
Yes, absolutely.

240

Andrew was a trifle eccentric,
Mr. Corso...

241
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,997
...but he wasn't insane.

242
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,457
It's true he'd been acting...

243
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,962
...strangely those last few days.
He shut himself up in here.

244
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,841
He seldom emerged
except for meals.

245
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,677
That morning, I was awoken...

246
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,346
...by the screams of the maid.

247
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,852
He'd hanged himself.

Mr. Corso,
what have you got for me?

345
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,552
- More than I bargained for.
- What do you mean?

- Yeah.
- The dealer?

352
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:40,280
I gave him your book to stash for
me, and now he's dead. Murdered.

353
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,907
Because of the book?

What else?

It was Mrs. Telfer
who made him buy it.

- He didn't seem particularly...
- Interested.

384
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,553

- Forgery?

- I took you for a professional.

- You speak too lightly of forgeries.
- Far too lightly.

388

Forging a book is
very expensive.

389
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:25,070
Paper of the period, right inks.
Too expensive to be profitable.

390

- Still, it can be done.
- Of course.

Requires a great skill,
but, yes, it can be done.

392
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:32,243
Do you think that could
be the case here?

393

What makes you ask?

394
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:37,582
My client wishes to satisfy himself
on the book's authenticity.

395
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,752
His name is Balkan. Boris
Balkan of New York.

396
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,839
- All books have a destiny of their own.
- And a life of their own.

397
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:48,968
Mr. Balkan is a celebrated collector.
He's no fool.

398
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:50,929
He must know this
book is authentic.

399
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,680
- We know it.
- So must he.

400
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:55,058
- We had this book for years.
- Many years.

401
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,769
And ample opportunity
to study it thoroughly.

402
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:01,064
The printing, the binding
are magnificent examples...

403
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,191
...of 17th century
Venetian craftsmanship.

404
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:07,862
Finest rag paper, resistant
to the passage of time.

405
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,323
None of your modern wood pulp.

406
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:14,411
Watermarks, ink, typefaces.

407
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:18,123
If this is a forgery, or a copy
with missing pages restored...

408
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,791
...it's the work of a master.

409
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,793
- A master.
- Yes.

410
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,129
Have you studied the engravings?

411
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:26,965
They seem to have some
underlying significance.

412
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,884
But of course.
Here, for example.

413
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:32,303
This one could be
interpreted as a warning.

414
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:37,725
"Venture too far," it seems to say, "and
danger will descend on you from above."

415
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:40,728
These type of books often
contain little puzzles.

416
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:44,274
Especially in the case of such
an illustrious collaborator.

417
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,442
Collaborator?

418
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,987
You could not have proceeded very
far in your research, señor.

419
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,655
Here, look close.

420
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:53,324
Now, you see? Only six of
the nine engravings...

421
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:55,243
...were signed by
Aristide Torchia.

465
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,001
Home, sweet home.

466
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:43,216
You won't say no to a
brandy, I take it?

467

<font color="#808080">CORSO:</font>
Thank you very much.

468
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,608
Thank you.

469
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,861
What handsome glasses.

470
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:06,447
They're the only
ones I have left.

471
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:08,533
Thanks.

472

- Must've been a beautiful place.
- It was.

473
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:16,582
But old families are like
ancient civilizations...

474
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:19,001
...they wither and die.

475
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:25,675
There they are, 834 our of them.

476
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,594
A pity you didn't see
them in better times.

477
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:29,971
I used to have 5000.

478
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:33,015
But these are the survivors.

479
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,393
So this is the
Fargas collection?

480
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:38,396
Not quite as I imagined
it, I must say.

481
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,064
C'est la vie, my friend.

482
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:45,152
But I keep them in perfect condition.
Safe from damp, light, heat, rats.

483
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,238
I dust and air them every day.

484
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:54,745
These are the occult.

485
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:56,581
What do you think?

486
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,875
- Not bad.
- Not bad indeed.

487
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:01,544
At least 10 of them are
extremely rare. Here.

488
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,589
Plancy's Dictionnaire Infernal.

489
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:08,843
First edition, 1844.

490
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:16,684
Leonardo Fioravanti's
Compendio de Secreti, 1571.

491
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,649
And there it is.

492
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,027
In perfect condition.

493
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:32,658
It has traveled the world for
three and a half centuries...

494
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:35,369
...yet it might've been
printed yesterday.

495
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:39,373
Is it in order? I mean, you haven't
detected anything unusual?

496
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:42,960
Unusual? No. The text is
complete, the engravings too.

497
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:45,963
Nine, plus the title page,
just as the catalog states...

498
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:50,134
...just like Kessler in Paris
and Telfer in New York.

499
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:53,137
Yes. It isn't the
Telfer anymore.

500
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:54,972
Telfer killed himself.

501
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:58,559
But he sold his copy
to Boris Balkan first.

502
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,645
Balkan.

503
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:03,731
If he sets his heart on a
book, no price is too high.

504
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:06,150
Not that I would
ever sell this one.

505
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:07,944
Not at any price.

506
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,280
It's...

507
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:13,783
It's strange that he
should've sent you here...

508
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,535
...if he already had...

509
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,956
You have it here?

510
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,708
May I see it?

511
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,521
Superb.

512
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:50,027
Beautiful.

513
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:51,696
Identical.

514
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,365
Two of the only three
to escape the flames...

515
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:57,952
...reunited for the first
time in over three centuries.

516
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:00,871
Yes.

517
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:03,207
Look at this slight
imperfection here.

518
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,209
The damaged S.

519
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:08,295
The same type, the
same impression.

520
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,881
Incredible.

521
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:15,720
You see, if it weren't for
this slight discoloration...

522
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:19,390
...on the back of your copy,
no one could tell them apart.

523
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:24,228
If you don't mind, I'd like to stay for
a while and examine them in detail.

524
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:30,067
What are you looking for,
Mr. Corso?

525
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:32,236
I'm not quite sure.

526
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:36,574
Some books are dangerous.
Not to be opened with impunity.

527
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,159
That's very true.

528
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,780
I'll be damned.

Unexpectedly.

Yes. Unexpectedly is right.

Good afternoon.

630
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:26,111
I'm Dean Corso. I have an
appointment with Baroness Kessler.

631
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,450
This way.

632
01:04:41,168 --> 01:04:43,837
You have 30 minutes.

633
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:51,511
- Yes?
- Monsieur Corso.

634
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:54,973
Oh, yes, Mr. Corso. Come in.

635
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:58,768
- I've heard a great deal about you.
- Oh.

636
01:04:58,936 --> 01:05:02,355
- Nothing good, I hope.
- You hope right. Merci, Simone.

637
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:05,942
Well, I'm reassured, baroness,
because in my trade...

638
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:10,864
...to be spoken well of can
be professionally disastrous.

639
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:15,243
- My God.
- Yes, there it is.

640
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:17,746
The Kessler collection.

641
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:21,499
I know your catalog
almost by heart.

642
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:23,376
Strange we haven't met before.

643
01:05:23,544 --> 01:05:26,129
Your name is a byword among
dealers and collectors.

644
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:30,759
But I imagine you know your own
reputation better than I do.

645
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:33,929
Yes, well, it does keep the wolf
from the door, so to speak.

646
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:36,056
Sorry, were you in the
middle of something?

647
01:05:36,223 --> 01:05:40,644
My latest work, The Devil, History
and Myth, a kind of biography.

648
01:05:41,228 --> 01:05:43,980
It will be published
early next year.

649
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:46,316
- Why the devil?
- I saw him one day.

650
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:50,403
I was 15 years old and I saw
him as plain as I see you now.

651
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:52,238
It was love at first sight.

652
01:05:52,406 --> 01:05:55,492
You know, 300 years ago, you'd
have been burned at the stake...

653
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:59,454
- ...for saying something like that.
- I wouldn't have said it.

654
01:05:59,872 --> 01:06:03,124
Nor would I have made a
million by writing about it.

655
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:04,834
Yeah.

656
01:06:05,002 --> 01:06:08,254
What is it you wish to discuss,
Mr. Corso?

657
01:06:08,422 --> 01:06:11,508
There's a book in your collection
I'd like to examine, if possible.

658
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:13,593
The Nine Gates of the
Kingdom of Shadows?

659
01:06:13,761 --> 01:06:16,805
The Nine Gates.
An interesting work.

660
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:19,224
Everyone's been asking
me about it lately.

661
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:21,851
- Is that so?
- Follow me.

662
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:27,732
Do you truly believe
in the devil, baroness?

663
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:31,778
Enough to devote my
life and my library to him.

664
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:35,365
Not to mention many
years of work.

665
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:36,700
Don't you?

666
01:06:36,867 --> 01:06:38,702
Almost.

667
01:06:40,204 --> 01:06:42,706
This book demands a
certain amount of faith.

668
01:06:42,873 --> 01:06:45,125
I'm afraid my faith is in
short supply these days.

669
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:50,005
I know this work extremely well.
I've studied it for years.

670
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:52,799
Do you have any doubts
about its authenticity?

671
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:54,801
- None whatsoever.
- You're sure?

672
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:57,470
My knowledge of this
book is profound.

673
01:06:57,638 --> 01:07:00,765
- I wrote a biography of its author.
- Yes, I've read it.

674
01:07:00,933 --> 01:07:04,144
Aristide Torchia, The Devil's Apprentice.
Excellent work.

675
01:07:04,311 --> 01:07:05,895
A courageous man.

676
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:10,150
He died for the sake of
this very book in 1667.

677
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:14,070
While studying the black arts in
Prague, he acquired a copy...

678
01:07:14,238 --> 01:07:16,614
...of the dread Delomelanicon.

679
01:07:16,782 --> 01:07:21,911
This is Torchia's adaptation of that work
which was written by Lucifer himself.

680
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:25,498
After they burned him at the stake,
a secret society was founded...

681
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:29,753
...to perpetuate its memory
and preserve its secrets.

682
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,964
The Order of the Silver Serpent.

683
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:36,092
- A sect?
- A kind of witches' coven.

684
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:38,762
For centuries, they have met
to read from this book...

685
01:07:38,929 --> 01:07:41,097
...and worship the
prince of darkness.

686
01:07:41,265 --> 01:07:44,267
Today, they have degenerated
into a social club...

687
01:07:44,435 --> 01:07:48,271
...for bored millionaires and
celebrities who use its meetings...

688
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:52,942
...as an excuse to indulge
their jaded sexual appetites.

689
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:55,862
I, myself, belonged
to the order.

690
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:59,491
Years ago, but time is
too precious at my age.

691
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:02,243
Besides, my orgy days are over.

692
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:04,120
I told them to go to the devil.

694
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:08,249
You mean it's all
about sex or...?

695
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:09,542
Of course not.

696
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:13,046
They are under the illusion that
they owe their money and success...

697
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:14,756
...to membership in the order.

698
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:15,965
Do they still meet?

699
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:19,677
Every year on the anniversary
of Torchia's death.

700
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:21,471
They'll be meeting
very soon now.

701
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:24,307
- And you say they read from this book.
- Not this one.

702
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:28,895
I took mine back when Liana Telfer
acquired the one in Toledo.

703
01:08:29,063 --> 01:08:30,814
Victor Fargas is a nonbeliever.

704
01:08:30,981 --> 01:08:35,902
He's always refused to participate, so
naturally, they use the Telfer copy.

705
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:38,279
Not that it has ever worked.

706
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:41,366
- Did Andrew Telfer ever take part?
- Telfer?

707
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,326
No, no.

708
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:47,247
That creature, Liana,
married him for his money.

709
01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:50,667
She comes of an old and
aristocratic French family...

710
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:53,086
...the Saint Martins, but
they were penniless...

711
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:57,173
...so Liana used his dollars
to restore her chateau...

712
01:08:57,341 --> 01:08:59,008
...and buy The Nine Gates.

713
01:08:59,176 --> 01:09:02,554
If he ever finds out what his wife
gets up to at these gatherings...

714
01:09:02,721 --> 01:09:04,681
...he'll probably kill himself.

715
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:09,102
Funny you should say that, baroness,
he hanged himself last week.

716
01:09:13,774 --> 01:09:17,402
Who, exactly, are you
working for, Mr. Corso?

717
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:21,698
My client's name is irrelevant, baroness.
I'm simply trying to authenticate his copy.

718
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:24,075
The one that Telfer sold
him before he died.

719
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:28,329
How stupid of me. I
should have guessed.

720
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:32,709
You've outstayed your welcome,
Mr. Corso.

721
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:35,128
I was hoping to examine
your copy in detail.

722
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:37,338
Certainly not.

723
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:40,008
Tell your client, who can
only be Boris Balkan...

724
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:44,804
...to come and examine
it himself, if he dares.

725
01:09:45,222 --> 01:09:49,434
Tell him not to send any more
wolves in sheep's clothing.

726
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:53,146
Now, kindly leave.

727
01:09:55,566 --> 01:09:59,235
I'm sorry if I
have troubled you.

You don't know what you're getting
yourself into, Mr. Corso.

Get out, before it's too late.

is, baroness.

How did you get on today?

773

- Where exactly are you?
- What about her copy?

774
01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:44,825
No. Why do I get
the impression...

775
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:47,244
...that you've been down
my neck the entire time?

776

You're an investment of mine, Mr. Corso.
I'm merely looking after it.

copy's authentic...

...but I didn't get a chance
to examine it closely.

779
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:04,762
She threw me out as soon as she guessed
that you were behind my visit.

First, let me apologize.

799
01:22:38,995 --> 01:22:42,873
I should've told you right away
that I'm working for Boris Balkan.

What is this supposed to be?

808
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:12,277
You said that your knowledge of
The Nine Gates was extensive...

809
01:23:12,445 --> 01:23:15,739
...but did you ever compare
your copy with the other two?

810
01:23:15,907 --> 01:23:17,533
No.

811
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:20,411
- Why?
- Well, you should.

812
01:23:20,578 --> 01:23:23,914
These are copies of the
engravings in Balkan's book.

813
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:26,667
You'll find that some of
them differ from yours.

814
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:28,627
Differ?

815
01:23:29,212 --> 01:23:32,840
So you question my book's
authenticity, do you?

816
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:35,509
If that's your peace offering,
you can take it and go.

817
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:38,053
My Nine Gates is
absolutely genuine.

818
01:23:38,221 --> 01:23:39,930
I don't dispute that, baroness.

819
01:23:40,098 --> 01:23:43,017
In my opinion, all three
copies are genuine.

820
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:45,519
But the fact remains,
they display variations.

821
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:47,813
Variations?

822
01:23:48,398 --> 01:23:51,692
If that were true, it
would be a revelation.

What makes you so sure?

824
01:23:55,113 --> 01:23:57,740
I've already compared these
with the Fargas engravings.

825
01:23:57,907 --> 01:24:00,200
And in his book...

826
01:24:01,494 --> 01:24:04,747
...the keys were
in the other hand.

827
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:08,584
Here, the doorway
wasn't bricked up.

828
01:24:09,335 --> 01:24:10,586
And in this one...

829
01:24:10,754 --> 01:24:14,256
...the man was hanging
by the other leg.

830

- Well, what?

I'm convinced there'll be a
third one in here somewhere.

837
01:25:01,971 --> 01:25:05,516
Three variations in three
copies makes nine.

838
01:25:05,683 --> 01:25:08,477
Coincidence, or something more?

839
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:13,524
Maybe Torchia hid the secret of the
Ninth Gate in three books, not one.

02:00:25,009 --> 02:00:29,179
I must travel alone,
but you may look on...

1080

...and marvel.

1081
02:00:30,848 --> 02:00:34,684
- That's very kind of you.
- Indeed it is.

1082
02:00:37,104 --> 02:00:40,190
There have been men who
have been burned alive...

1083
02:00:40,358 --> 02:00:43,735
...or disemboweled for
just a glimpse...

1084
02:00:43,903 --> 02:00:48,949
...of what you are
about to witness.

1085
02:00:56,207 --> 02:00:58,583
I give you my
allegiance, master.

I pledge myself to
you, body and soul.

nor fire, nor poison.

...inscribe me in the
black book of death.

Admit me to the ninth gate.

Let it be so.

Let it be so now.

1093
02:01:31,826 --> 02:01:33,535
Yes.

1094
02:01:35,079 --> 02:01:38,957
I feel the power surge through
me like an electric current...

1095
02:01:39,125 --> 02:01:42,335
...rendering me capable of
any feat of mind or body.

1096
02:01:42,503 --> 02:01:44,045
I'm invulnerable.

That's just great.
