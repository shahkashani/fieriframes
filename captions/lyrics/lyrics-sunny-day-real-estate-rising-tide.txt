Welcome to the lonesome world of Abel.
Where every brother's knife is set to slay you.
And paranoia keeps you healthy.
Crooked deals can keep you wealthy.
Serum vials to help you when you're sad.

Every other face is bent and broken.
Wrap your teeth around the only game in town.
Made you clothes from insulation.
Break your day for pay and ration.
Hide.
Hide.
Hide.

Killed by an angel.
Lost inside amazing colors.
It's never how you feel.
It comes in a bottle.
Let's say you found a gun.
How would your bad side burn?
It's never how you feel.
It comes in a bottle.

Relax and all these whores will lick the membrane.
Just a touch, a stain, a hole in your brain.
It's cold when you remove the nails.
Beg for more when all else fails.
Serum vials to help you when you're sad.

Killed by an angel.
Lost inside amazing colors.
It's never how you feel.
It comes in a bottle.
Let's say you found a gun.
How would your bad side burn?
It's never how you feel.
It comes in a bottle.

The way the sea reflects the sun.
Long gone.
And all the miracles of love.
Long gone.
You hold your heart out in your hand.
One last long sigh gone.
One last long sigh gone.

When you see the sores you can't believe them.
Pathogenic lovers in a basement cell.
Dirty white sheets cut up in strips.
Cracks in the mirror, and your mind slips.
Serum vials to help you when you're sad.

Killed by an angel.
Lost inside amazing colors.
It's never how you feel.
It comes in a bottle.
Let's say you found a gun.
How would your bad side burn?
It's never how you feel.
It comes in a bottle.

Killed by an angel.
Killed by an angel.
And it's strange.
How we're wasting our lives.
Novocane.
When the pain helps us rise.
Here we stay.
Though it's only a clever game.
Running from our lives.
And we linger on...
But if we try to lift up our eyes.
Replacing the lies.
We own this moment.
Everything and everyone and in the end we all are one.
The truth will not be denied.
Everything and everyone and in the end we all are one.
The truth will not be denied.

And it's strange.
How we're selling our time and we wait.
We are lost in a clever game.
Running from our lives.
And they lead us on.
But if we try to lift up our eyes.
Replacing the lies.
We own this moment.
Everything and everyone and in the end we all are one.
The truth will not be denied.
Everything and everyone and in the end we all are one.
The truth will not be denied.

Everything and everyone and in the end we all are one.
The truth will not be denied.
Everything and everyone and in the end we all are one.
The truth will not be denied.
All games they play.
Undead and awake and returning within.
You are a devil, they say.
And its candy.

How long I've known.
This seed burst and grown.
You're the one that I love.
You are the one that I trust.
And its candy.

When they speak of the open door.
And the way you've flown, its fine.
When they show me the evidence.
And theyre talking down your memory.

Nevermind the words they waste.
They can't see you're mine.
Waiting here until words run out.
Dreaming of the day when you.
Open your arms in the light of our love.

Of course.
We're miles away from home.
We sink like stones.
And we're lost beneath the waves.
Not a trace to mark the graves.

Lost and tired.
And chained.

Of course.
We plan the great escape.
We drag our fate around the razor wire.
But our fear keeps us in line.

Turn me inside out this time.
Looking back the place that I come from.
Disappeared.
Turn my face.
To the place where I go into the sun.
Disappear into the sun.

Lost and tired.
And chained.

I know.
What sleeps inside my heart.
There's a path that starts.
With a single step at dawn.
Though the road goes on and on.

Turn me inside out this time.
Looking back the place that I come from.
Disappeared.
Turn my face.
To the place where I go into the sun.
Disappear into the sun.

Turn me inside out this time.
Looking back the place that I come from.
Disappeared.
Turn my face.
To the place where I go into the sun.
Disappear into the sun.

(Deep inside a song a thousand miles away)
(Every moment the start of a greater day)
(Running to a field a world we'll find)

And now.
The time has come for me.
I must break free.
From the prison I have made.
And to face the way ahead.

Turn me inside out this time.
Looking back the place that I come from.
Disappeared.
Turn my face.
To the place where I go into the sun.
Disappear into the sun.

Disappear into the sun.
Disappear into the sun.
(Does this) wilted flower seem strange to you.
With all this poison at the roots?
Shut away from love and light.
And you wonder why its screaming...

Old enough to abuse me.
But all too cheap to amuse me.

We stand at the marketplace.
With cold September eyes on the hungry people.
We passed the interrogation.
Signed our names at the bottom of the.
Government paper.

Calling memories out of mind.
Pictures writhing deep inside.
And once you've seen it's hard to hide.
You wonder why you're screaming.

Strong enough not to fear me.
But all too loud now to hear me.

We stand at the marketplace.
With cold September eyes on the hungry people.
We passed the interrogation.
Signed our names at the bottom of the.
Government paper.
This winter time.
To waste your life.
You reign you die.
You wait you cry.
This time in the light.
A small flame in the night.
You come you bend you burn.
You burn you burn ...

Sick enough to infect me.
But too far gone to protect me.
We stand at the marketplace.
With cold September eyes on the hungry people.
We passed the interrogation.
Signed our names at the bottom of the.
Government paper.
All around.
I see you're under my skin.
Cruel to say.
I've known the best of my life.

Never again to hear.
The rivers' song so clear.

Everyday's another scene.
The world around and everything for you.
An open door a cauldron of.
Waves rush in through every house for all.
So they say another lie:
'Love's a rumor.
But love will die'.
We're lost and wandering.

Deep in the ocean.
There lies a wave for you.

When you hit the ground.
It's hard to speak.
But its who you are.
A shining star.
Go.
Tell the millions begin!
We'll run through the fields.
The turning of wheels.
Down with the buildings.
Worlds on your shoulders.
Climb through the wasteland.
Wait for the sky to remind you.
These things are true.

About the day.
Me and the fool in the photograph.
A soul many times revealed.
The scars only have concealed.

I wonder how many days I'll bleed.
With the words I refuse to form.
Now I will be free.
But lately I refuse you.

With these arms I will break through you.
Wait only to see you far removed.

No more the fool in the photograph.
That night chained in your embrace.
Day dawned and I saw your face.

I wonder how many days I'll bleed.
With the words I begin to form:
Now I will be free.

Lately I refuse you.
With these arms I will break through you.
Wait only to see you far removed.

Wasting time you tell the story still.
Made your mind you're chasing the moon.
Making scars among the glory.
Still you're pulling down.
Wasting time you tell the story.
Some kind of magic.
I've waited here all too long...
Tearing in my heart when the world falls apart.
And it's almost too hard.
Tearing in your mind, how the pain makes you blind.
When it's all said and done.

Tearing in my heart, a mistake from the start.
And it's almost too hard.
Tarry in my mind, i'll repay you another time.
When it's all said and done.

Tearing in your bones when the road left you alone.
And it's almost too hard.
Tarry in my soul and you help make me whole.
When it's all said and done.

Tearing in my heart when the world falls apart.
And it's almost too hard.
Tarry in my soul and you help make me whole.
When it's all said and done.
She's always around and under my skin.
Watching her move.
How she tells a story.
It's only a dream of lovers and lies.
She's cruel and she's free like television.

She's in my head, like television...

We fall into bed.
Our tongues are tied.
Her lips and her eyes are so disarming.
And when we embrace, she pulls me inside.
I wake up alone with television.
Crawl around the story.
Oh, how her waves wash over me.
Lost inside her story.

She shows me the world.
I see through her eyes the beauty of brave new understanding.
It's only a dream of lovers and lies.
I carry with me in all my vision.
She's always around and under my skin.
She's always around and under my skin.
Watching her move.
How she tells a story.
It's only a dream of lovers and lies.
She's cruel and she's free like television...
Crawl around the story.
Oh, how the waves wash over me.
Lost inside her story.

She's in my head, like television.
Like television.
These fears come rushing in when I enter here.
Another layer on my back.
A blazing fire where our glances meet.
The largest feeling towering over me.

Faces in disguise.
Not a trace of desire.

I long to take you a secret place.
Where we could lay aside our past.
We'd throw the world away with all it's pain.
To shine like stars through storm and clouds and.
Rain.

Faces in disguise.
Not a trace of desire.
(Cold faces in disguise)
(Not a trace of desire)

Go face the day.
Go and see new things.
Go face the day.
But you'll remember me...

I see a tear inside when you're turned away.
Another wound that i'd take back.
If i could fill your heart just once and then.
I'd take you now where we could live again.

Faces in disguise.
Not a trace of desire.
(Cold faces in disguise)
(Not a trace of desire)

Go face the day.
Go and see new things.
Go face the day.

Color your skin with gold and the violence remains.
Cover your eyes with rose but the stain remains.
Will you escape your life with all the walls you build?
Smother your will and lead you into fashion...

Morning comes in the dream before we rise.
When we linger side by side.
It's my heart that speaks this time:
We will ride the rising tide.

Color your skin with gold and the violence remains.
Cover your eyes with rose but the stain remains.
Will you repair your life with all the holes you fill?
Smother your will and drain you of your passion.

Morning comes in the dream before we rise.
When we linger side by side.
It's my heart that speaks this time:
We will ride the rising tide.

Color your skin with gold and the violence remains.
Cover your eyes with rose but the stain remains.
Will you defend your life and all the hope you feel?
Or smother your will and lead you into fashion...

Morning comes in the dream before we rise.
When we linger side by side.
It's my heart that speaks this time:
We will ride the rising tide.
