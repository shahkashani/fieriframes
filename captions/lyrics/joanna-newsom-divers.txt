Sending the first scouts over.
Back from the place beyond the dawn:
Horse, bear your broken soldier.
Eyes frozen wide at what went on.

And Time, in our camp, is moving.
As you’d anticipate it to.
But what is this sample proving?
Anecdotes cannot say what Time may do.

I kid with Rufous Nightjar.
When our men are all asleep:
“It ain’t about how rare you are.
But how hard you are to see.
Take, you and me—".

“When are you from?” said he.
In our blind of winter leaves.
As we sighted out their fliers.
In the grayscale of the night.
Fumbled on the bare ground.
To bury round landmines.
While the dew lay down and dried.

We signal Private Poorwill, when morning starts to loom:
“Pull up from your dive!”.
Till we hear the telltale Boom.
Too soon—
Hotdogging loon, caught there.
Like a shard of mirror in the moon!

Now they’ve stopped giving orders.
But I follow anyway.
Laying in our state of torpor.
Waiting out the day.
While the dew burns away.

Rushing, tearing, speeding home:
Bound to a wheel that is not my own.
Where round every bend I long to see.
Temporal infidelity.

Then all along the road, the lights stream by.
I want to go where the dew won’t dry.
I want to go where the light won’t bend—
Far as the eye may reach—nor end.

But, inasmuch as that light is loaned.
And, insofar as we’ve borrowed bones.
Must every debt now be repaid.
In star-spotted, sickle-winged night raids.
While we sing to the garden, and we sing to the stars.
And we sing in the meantime.
Wherever you are?

In the folds and the branches.
Somewhere, out there.
I was only just born into open air.
Now hush, little babe.
You don’t want to be.
Down in the trenches.
Remembering with me.

Where you will not mark my leaving.
And you will not hear my parting song.
Nor is there cause for grieving.
Nor is there cause for carrying on.

—and daughter, when you are able.
Come down and join! The kettle’s on.
And your family’s round the table.
Will you come down, before the sun is gone?
The cause is Ozymandian.
The map of Sapokanikan.
Is sanded and bevelled.
The land lone and levelled.
By some unrecorded and powerful hand.

Which plays along the monument.
And drums upon a plastic bag.
The brave-men-and-women-so-dear-to-God-
And-famous-to-all-of-the-ages rag.

Sing: Do you love me?
Will you remember?
The snow falls above me.
The renderer renders:
The event is in the hand of God.

Beneath a patch of grass, her.
Bones the old Dutch master hid.
While elsewhere Tobias.
And the angel disguise.
What the scholars surmise was a mother and kid.

Interred with other daughters.
In dirt in other potter's fields.
Above them, parades.
Mark the passing of days.
Through parks where pale colonnades arch in marble and steel.

Where all of the twenty-thousand attending your footfall.
And the cause that they died for are lost in the idling bird calls.
And the records they left are cryptic at best.
Lost in obsolescence.
The text will not yield, nor x-ray reveal.
With any fluorescence.
Where the hand of the master begins and ends.

I fell, I tried to do well but I won't be.
Will you tell the one that I loved to remember and hold me.
I call and call for the doctor.
But the snow swallows me whole with ol' Florry Walker.
And the event lives only in print.

He said:
"It's alright, and it's all over now".
And boarded the plane.
His belt unfastened.
The boy was known to show unusual daring.
And, called a "boy".
This alderman, confounding Tammany Hall.
In whose employ King Tamanend himself preceded John’s fall.

So we all raise a standard.
To which the wise and honest soul may repair.
To which a hunter.
A hundred years from now, may look and despair.
And see with wonder.
The tributes we have left to rust in the park.
Swearing that our hair stood on end.
To see John Purroy Mitchel depart.
For the Western Front.
Where work might count.
All exeunt! All go out!
Await the hunter, to decipher the stone.
(and what lies under, now)
The city is gone.

Look and despair.
Look and despair.
Hay and a clean stall.
And ivy on a garden wall.
And a sign saying sold.
And an old coat for the bad cold.

I believe in you.
Do you believe in me?
What do you want to do?
Are we leaving the city?

On the black road.
Through the gold fields.
While the fields are plowed.
Towards what we are allowed.

The bridle bends in idle hands.
And slows your canter to a trot.
We mean to stop in increments.
But can’t commit, we post and sit in impotence.

The harder you hit, the deeper the dent.
We seek our name, we seek our fame.
And our credentials, paned in glass.
Trained to master incidentals.
Bleach our collar, leach our dollar.
From our cents.
The longer you live, the higher the rent.

Beneath the pale sky.
Beside the red barn.
Below the white clouds.
Is all we are allowed.

Here, the light will seep.
And the scythe will reap.
And spirit will rend.
In counting toward the end.

In December of that year.
The word came down that she was here.
The days grew shorter.
I was sure if she came 'round.
I’d hold my ground, I'd endure.
But they'd alluded to a change.
That came to pass.
And spring, deranged, weeping grass and sleepless broke.
Herself upon my windowglass.

And I could barely breathe for seeing.
All the splintered light that leaked.
Her fissures fleeing, launched in flight.
Unstaunched daylight, brightly bleeding.
Bleached the night with dawn deleting.
In that high sun after our good run.
When the spirit bends.
Beneath knowing it must end.

And that is all I want here.
To draw my gaunt spirit to bow.
Beneath what I am allowed.
Beneath what I am allowed.
What we built, at the kiln that won’t be stilled.
Did not set well:

The old veil of desire.
Like the vessels that we fired.
Fell thin as eggshells.

And every season, somebody burns.
Downtown, taking turns–.
Taking a bus, to take a train and just plain vamoose.
Now the wind blows coals over the hills. Honey.
I’ve been paying my bills.
But honey it’s been a long time since I’ve come to any use.
And it hurt me bad, when I heard the news.
That you’d got that call, and could not refuse.

(A goose, alone, I suppose, can know the loneliness of geese.
Who never find their peace, whether North, or South, or West, or East, West or East;
And I could never find my way.
To being the kind of friend you seemed to need in me.
Till the needing had ceased.)

Recently, a bottle of rye, and a friend, and me.
On our five loose legs.
Had a ramble, and spoke.
Of the scrambling of broken hopes, and goose eggs.
And of a stranger, long ago.
(Not you, honey! You, I know.)
We just spoke of broken hopes and old strangers.
Now the wind blows coals over the sea. Tell you what, honey:
You and me better run and see if we can’t contain them, first.

But you had somewhere that you had to go.
And you caught that flight out of Covelo.
Now, overhead, you’re gunning in those Vs.
Where you had better find your peace.
Whether North, or South, or West, or East.
West or East.
And I had better find my way.
To being the kind of friend you seemed to need in me.
At last (at least)

What’s redacted will repeat.
And you cannot learn that you burn when you touch the heat.
So we touch the heat.
And we cut facsimiles of love and death.
(just separate holes in sheets.
Where you cannot breathe, and you cannot see)

And I cannot now, for the life of me, believe our talk –.
Our flock had cause to leave.
But do we?
Do we?
I believed they had got what they came for;
I believed our peril was done.
On the eve of the last of the Great Wars.
After three we had narrowly won.
(But the fourth.
It was carelessly done.)

I saw his ship in its whistling ascension.
As they launched from the Capitol seat–.
Swear I saw our mistake.
When the clouds draped like a flag.
Across the backs of the fleet.
Of the Hundred-First Lightborne Elite.

As the day is long.
So the well runs dry.
And we came to see Time is taller.
Than Space is wide.
And we bade goodbye.
To the Great Divide:
Found unlimited simulacreage to colonize!

But there was a time we were lashed to the prow.
Of a ship you may board, but not steer.
Before You and I ceased to mean Now.
And began to mean only Right Here.
(to mean Inches and Miles, but not Years);
Before Space has a taste of its limits.
And a new sort of coordinate awoke.
Making Time just another poor tenant:
Bearing weight, taking fire, trading smokes.
In the war between us and our ghosts.

(But I saw the Bering Strait and the Golden Gate.
In silent suspension of their golden age!
And you can barely tell, if I guard it well.
Where I have been, and seen.
Pristine, unfelled.)

I had a dream that I walked in the garden.
Of Chabot, and those telescope ruins.
It was there that I called to my true love.
Who was pale as millennial moons.
Honey, where did you come by that wound?

When I woke, he was gone.
And the War had begun.
In eternal return and repeat.
Calling, Where in the hell are the rest of your fellow.
One Hundred-One Lightborne Elite?
Stormed in the New Highland Light Infantry.

Make it stop, my love!
We were wrong to try.
Never saw what we could unravel.
In traveling light.
Nor how the trip debrides–.
Like a stack of slides!
All we saw was that Time is taller than Space is wide.

That's why we are bound to a round desert island.
'neath the sky where our sailors have gone.
Have they drowned, in those windy highlands?
Highlands away, my John.
If I have the space of half a day.
I'm ashamed of half the things I say.
I'm ashamed to have turned out this way.
And I desire to make amends.

But it don't make no difference, now.
And no one's listening, anyhow.
And lists of sins and solemn vows.
Don't make you any friends.

There's an old trick played.
When the light and the wine conspire.
To make me think I'm fine.
I'm not, but I have got half a mind.
To maybe get there, yet.

When the sky goes pink in Paris, France.
Do you think of the girl who used to dance.
When you'd frame her moving within your hands.
Saying, "This I won't forget".

What happened to the man you were.
When you loved somebody before her?
Did he die?
Or does that man endure, somewhere far away?

Our lives come easy and our lives come hard.
And we carry them like a pack of cards:
Some we don't use, but we don't discard.
But keep for a rainy day.
A diver is my love.
And I am his, if I am not deceived.
Who takes one breath above for every hour below the sea.

Who gave to me a jewel.
Worth twice this woman's life, but would cost her less.
Than laying at low tide to see her true love phosphoresce.

And in an infinite regress.
Tell me why is the pain of birth.
Lighter borne than the pain of death?
I ain't saying that I loved you first.
But I loved you best.

I know we must abide.
Each by the rules that bind us here:
The divers and the sailors and the women on the pier.

But how do you choose your form?
How do you choose your name? How do you choose your life?
How do you choose the time you must exhale and kick and rise?

And in an infinite capsize.
Like a bull tearing down the coast.
Double hulls bearing double masts.
I don’t know if you loved me most.
But you loved me last.

Recall the word you gave.
To count your way across the depths of this arid world.
Where you would yoke the waves and lay a bed of shining pearls.

I dream it every night:
The ringing of the pail, the motes of sand dislodged, the shucking, quick and bright:
The twinned and cast off shells reveal a single heart of white.

And in an infinite backslide.
Ancient border, sink past the West.
Like a sword at the bearer's fall.
I can't claim that I knew you best.
But did you know me at all?

A woman is alive, a woman is alive.
You do not take her for a sign.
In nacre on a stone, alone, unfaceted and fine.

And never will I wed.
I'll hunt the pearl of death to the bottom of my life.
And ever hold my breath till I may be the diver's wife.

See how the infinite divides.
And the divers are not to blame.
For the rift spanning distant shores.
You don’t know my name.
But I know yours.
It's the same old lady putting out the wash.
Standing in the rain in the mackintosh.
Same old lady standing in the rain.
The thought of New York was going insane.

Hey little leaf lying on the ground.
Now you're turning slightly brown.
Why don't you come back on the tree.
Turn the color green the way you ought to be?

My mind is fading and my body grows weak.
And my lips won't form the words I speak.
And now I'm floating away on a barrel of pain.
New York City won't see me again.

It's the same old man sitting at the mill.
The mill wheel turning of its own free will.
I'm certainly glad to be at home.
New York City continues on alone.
I'm certainly glad to be at home.
New York City continues on alone.
New York City continues on alone.
New York City continues.
And what do you remember most?
The line of the sea, seceding the coast?
Fine capillaries, glowing with cars?
The comfort you drew from the light of the stars?

And how long did you climb that night.
With the ice in your lungs, on the rungs of the light?
Beyond recall, you severed all strings.
To everyone, and everything.

Oh, silent, constant driver of mine.
Wordlessly calling from the end of the line.
Where even though each hour I ever loved.
Must queue and dive.
Still, you will not take my heart alive.
You will not take my heart alive.
You will not take my heart alive.
You will not take my heart.

In martial wind, and in clarion rain.
We minced into battle, wincing in pain;
Not meant for walking, backs bound in twine:
Not angel or devil.
But level, in time.

And I rose, to take my shape at last.
From the dreams that had dogged me, through every past.
When to my soul the body would say:
You may do what you like.
As long as you stay.

Now the towns and forests, highways and plains.
Fall back in circles like an emptying drain.
And I won't come round this way again.
Where the lonely wind abides.
And you will not take my heart, alive.
You will not take my heart alive.
You will not take my heart.
My life comes and goes.
My life comes and goes.
Short flight, free rows:
I lie down and doze.

My life came and went.
My life came and went.
Short flight; free descent.
Poor flight attendant.

But the sky, over the ocean!
And the ocean, skirting the city!
And the city, bright as a garden.
(when the garden woke to meet me)

From that height was a honeycomb.
Made of light from those funny homes, intersected:
Each enclosed, anelectric and alone.

In our lives is a common sense.
That relies on the common fence.
That divides, and attends.
But provides scant defense.
From the Great Light that shines through a pin-hole.
When the pin-light calls itself Selfhood.
And the Selfhood inverts on a mirror.
In an Amora Obscura.

But it's mine. Or, at least, it's lent.
And my life, until the time is spent.
Is a pin-light, bent.
It's a pin-light, bent.
(Mourning Dove calls)

Time passed hard.
And the task was the hardest thing she'd ever do.
But she forgot.
The moment she saw you.

So it would seem to be true:
When cruel birth debases, we forget.
When cruel death debases.
We believe it erases all the rest.
That precedes.

But stand brave, life-liver.
Bleeding out your days.
In the river of time.
Stand brave:
Time moves both ways.

In the nullifying, defeating, negating, repeating.
Joy of life;
The nullifying, defeating, negating, repeating.
Joy of life.

The moment of your greatest joy sustains:
Not axe nor hammer.
Tumor, tremor.
Can take it away, and it remains.
It remains.

And it pains me to say, I was wrong.
Love is not a symptom of time.
Time is just a symptom of love.

(and the nullifying, defeating, negating, repeating.
Joy of life;
The nullifying, defeating, negating, repeating.
Joy of life)

Hardly seen, hardly felt–.
Deep down where your fight is waiting.
Down 'till the light in your eyes is fading:
Joy of life.
Where I know that you can yield, when it comes down to it;
Bow like the field when the wind combs through it:
Joy of life.
And every little gust that chances through.
Will dance in the dust of me and you.
With joy-of-life.
And in our perfect secret-keeping:
One ear of corn.
In silent, reaping.
Joy of life.

Joy! Again, around–a pause, a sound–a song:
A way a lone a last a loved a long.
A cave, a grave, a day: arise, ascend.
(Areion, Rharian, go free and graze. Amen.)

A shore, a tide, unmoored–a sight, abroad:
A dawn, unmarked, undone, undarked (a god)
No time. No flock. No chime, no clock. No end.
White star, white ship–Nightjar, transmit: transcend!

White star, white ship–Nightjar, transmit: transcend!
White star, white ship–Nightjar, transmit: transcend!
White star, white ship–Nightjar, transmit: trans-
