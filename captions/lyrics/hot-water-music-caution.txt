I need a remedy of diesel and dust.
Something I can taste with a fix I can trust.
Another high, more potent than lust.
Eating and repeating like the working of rust and time.

I woke to the sound and the rhythm of rain.
Dancing down on the window pane.
Comatose, eyes half-closed.
Arms wrapped up with the wounds all sewn.
I'm froze from head to toe.
Clenched the jaw, then felt my body roll over slow.

I must live to know.
Healing takes some time.

So no, no regrets, no looking back to sinking ships.
So I'll strip the gauze for a rational self-analysis.
"I'm down, cut and bound.
Counting scars, counting blessings loud, so loud".

I must live to know.
That time alone is always (No regrets or falling fits)
Healing (I'll strip the gauze and bleed it)
As long as there's (No regrets or falling fits)
Bleeding (I'll strip the gauze and bleed it)

Always (No regrets or falling fits)
Healing (I'll strip the gauze and bleed it)
As long as there's (No regrets or falling fits)
Bleeding (I'll strip the gauze and bleed it)

There's no (No regrets or falling fits)
Worry (I'll strip the gauze and bleed it)
It's only (No regrets or falling fits)
A simple therapy (I'll strip the gauze and bleed it)
You'll get it right sometime, you will.
I tell myself that every day.
You don't need to latch on.
To anything, you'll just end up back here.
In your little limbo scene.
It's repetitious and exhausting.
I might need some therapy.
Anything to keep me in check through the day.

Don't think about your lover.
You're already steady shaking.
I might need a sedative.
But I hate the taste of medicine.
You just need to let her go.
These pills shaking in my hand.
Just make me feel defeated.
Like I'm not able to just let her go away.

I hate this place, but I love these chords.
An empty fate just means an even score.
And the pain this morning, it filled my head.
It's Jameson, it means that I'm not dead.

And I just can't seem to get away.
There's no such thing as escape.
Even with the sedatives.
You're always in the same state.
Clutching to a limbo scene.
You're never changing anything.
You just stop the shaking.
And it's constantly repeated through the days.
Through the days.

I hate this place, but I love these chords.
An empty fate just means an even score.
And the pain this morning, it filled my head.
It's Jameson, it means that I'm not dead.

I was hanging on by a little thread.
Just minutes before I was on a mountain.
I screamed "I can see all.".
The ground broke from the sound.
It was all built on nothing.

Caution: the solid ground that you.
Are on will slide from under you.

And the pretty lights down below.
Begged me to just let go;
To let myself be condemned;
To start again.

Caution: the solid ground that you.
Are on will slide from under you.
Caution: the solid ground that you.
Are on will slide from under you.
Under you.

I opened up my aching hands.
I went down like an avalanche.
I took with me the things I found.
I used them to help slow me down.
And start again.

(Caution: the solid ground that you.
Are on will slide from under you.) x2.

Caution: the solid ground that you.
Are on will slide from under you.
Under you.
It's one step to slip.
Off the edge, to trip.
And roll tumbling over everything standing in the way.
That's bled dry and decayed.

All and all, we walk or crawl, either way still covering ground.
In banners or bandages.
All and all, we walk or crawl, dressed up right or naked and plain.
In banners or bandages.

I'll call up fears to meet.
And spit them out, down in front of me then bury them to this beat.
And take everything with a grain of salt.
To let all rubbish rot without a thought.

All and all, we walk or crawl, either way still covering ground.
In banners or bandages.
All and all, we walk or crawl, dressed up right or naked and plain.
In banners or bandages.

In banners or bandages.

One step started every single evolution.
Then sent them spinning off in constant revolutions.
It's one step to slip off the edge to go tumbling.
And I'm all for the fall.

All and all, we walk or crawl, either way still covering ground.
In banners or bandages.
All and all, we walk or crawl, dressed up right or naked and plain.

In banners or bandages.
It's already so hard to obtain...
But I'm sure you will.
Make it all complicated.
That a cartain fall.
Is bound to send you.
To the cold floor.
You know it's all related.

The view descent's reminiscent of...
You know it's all related.

When you come.
Crumbling.
You will grow back again.
Don't hold your breath.
Don't lie awake.
But don't hesitate.
Be ready to see.
Right.
Right.
Ready to see.

The view in ascent's reminiscent of...
You know it's all related.

When you come.
Crumbling.
You will grow back again.
Don't hold your breath.
Don't lie awake.
But don't hesitate.
Be ready to see.
This is not a model fit for any mold.
The twisted, old, and bitter tongues are reckless just as they are cold.
Dwelling on the dying is wet fingers to the flame.
I cannot say that I believe in everything that you propose to me.

I'd rather learn from children.
I'd rather see their world.
In all its natural splendor.
All its harsh distress unknown.

Not what's old and jaded.
Forgotten or ignored.
Or in the way of anything.
There to keep the flame from burning.

I read the writing on the wall.
And all I see is "Who has lost the sense?".
I see the writing on the wall.
And all I see is "Got to get it to give".

Got to get it to give.

I want to know what you, what you know.
Not the little things you'll learn to guard you.
All the little things we'll teach you.

All that I care to know is what you're wondering.
All that I care to see is what you're seeing.

I read the writing on the wall.
And all I see is "Who has lost the sense?".
I see the writing on the wall.
And all I see is "Got to get it to give".

Got to get it to give.
You were tenderly afflicted.
And it was cold as hell.
There was nobody there.
That you could tell.

How it came out of the clear blue.
Like a vengeful ice storm.
You felt it come down.
But it don't matter now.

It'll all be over soon.

You were tenderly afflicted.
And frozen in your place.
With your wonderful fears.
That tortures your faith.

But you wouldn't move anyway.
Not for anyone.
You needed the pain.
To feel you had a connection.

It'll all be over soon.

Is there something you can stand on?
For you.
It seems there's nothing left to stand on.
It'll all be over soon.

So things are not the same.
Cut all loss and walk away.
What was said is done, so independence comes.
And there none the like.

No more lonely souls under changing leaves.
And no more weary wrecks.
Seeking harmony.
While waiting for their rest.

So choice is always free.
Granted, nothing is but sure.
Death won't set us free, nor will misery.
When we fear those words.

We fear that we'll erode.
Quick with no control.

I won't lay sick and sorely.
With my soul uneasy.
And the ground beneath me hollow and breaking up.
Cracking to swallow me whole.

When we get cut.
It's good to know that.
Sweet disasters.
Are just as precious.

We fall down to kiss the ground.
And live to love and lose.
All is well, if all fails.
At least we'll know the truth.
I was back and forth.
From armed to desperate.
Lost to fully aware.
How was your weekend?

You get your time alone?
It used to sound so peaceful.
Now it's panic-ridden.
How was your weekend?

I'm alright for now, but I haven't been.
I got lots of shit behind me.
Alright for now.

I'll talk while I can.
But it hasn't been that easy.
It's simple talk at best.
Like "how was your weekend?".

I'm alright for now, but I haven't been.
I got lots of shit behind me.
Alright for now.

When I went away.
I made no decisions.
I couldn't trust them to me.
I was too weak then.

I'm alright for now, but I haven't been.
I got lots of shit behind me.
Alright for now, but I haven't been.

I'm alright for now, but I haven't been.

Alright for now.
Used to always want to sleep.
Used to want to (but couldn't) leave.
And I barely found the way.
Through the darkness and the trees.
There were thoughts attacking me.
I saw the some come, in New Orleans.
Through the window n the front.
We just smoked and watched it come;
Being lazy with the gray light.
In the back room.
Where we could talk and all.
But we were burnt.
We got our wards back with the morning.
And we'll say anything we want.
Though we don't know what we don't know.
About having time away.
I know you miss things everyday.
Certainn things made you feel safe.
And I had mine saving me.
How fleeting they came to be.
Certian things made me feel needed.
It's a gamble, double down or don't.
Step out if you want to, stay in if you're bold, and roll.
Could be a sure shot, or just as well, a fold.
Guessing's never easy and wishes never sold like gold.

The wheels are turning, the world keeps burning and all fall.
To sweet defeat, so complete.
Oh, call it humbling or brand it stumbling.
Don't stop living and don't stop sailing to meet what will be destiny.

We are wayfarers.
With a wish to stay alive.
For a cause, for a dream.
There's much to move in a moving sea.

Could be a sure shot, or just as well, a fold.
Guessing's never easy and wishes never sold like gold.
How about a handle or something set to hold?
Love is everlasting when love is on the road, I'm told.

We are wayfarers.
With a wish to stay alive.
For a cause, for a dream.
There's much to move in a moving sea.
If I could just begin to forget where I have been.
Maybe we wouldn't be here.
But I pace within a haze, I keep bumping into days.
And waiting for them to end.

These complicated words are coming down.
I've searched for them so long it's comical.
These complicated words are coming down.
I've been searching so long.

Been tongue-tied, tired and sick.
Like I'm training for the end.
I have been gasping for air.
I've been training for the end.

And I should've known better but I thought we were clear.
There I go thinking again.
Now look at our broken bones, they want to heal but they don't.
We've nothing but tape to mend them.

These complicated words are coming down.
