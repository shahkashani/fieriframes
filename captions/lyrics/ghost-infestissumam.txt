Infestissumam.
Unholy is the lust in your eyes.
“Blasphemous” would not suffice (Ah)
Perverted are your wishes and dreams.
Tanning in Lucifer's beams (Ah)

Per Aspera Ad Inferi.
Per Aspera Ad Inferi.
Per Aspera Ad Inferi.

All your dreams will come true.
All your dreams will come true (Oh)
Oh, Satan, devour us all.
Hear our desperate call.

You know that the fog is here omnipresent.
When the diseases sees no cure.
You know that the fog is here omnipresent.
When the intents remain obscure.
Forever more.

Weave us a mist, fog weaver.
Hide us in shadows, unfathomable.
Wall less maze… a secular haze.

You know that his son is near omnipotent.
When she sees eye to eye with spear.
You know that his son is near omnipotent.
When youth and innocence disappear.
Forever lost.

Weave us a mist, fog weaver.
Hide us in shadows, unfathomable.
Wall less maze… a secular haze.

He is divinity omniscient.
Seeing the world revolve with spite.
The surge of humanity oblivious.
To the divine whom bringeth light.
Let there be night.

Weave us a mist, fog weaver.
Hide us in shadows, fog weaver.
Come, mist eternal, huh.
Come, mist eternal, huh.
Come, secular haze.
I am the one who preys on weak.
I offer everything they seek.
And I am the one who comes richly endowed.
Harvesting crops of fields that others have plowed.

I am the one, lascivious.

I am the son of one below.
The progeny of beast of woe.
And I am the son who comes into the daughters of men.
Destroying all and make them want it again.

I am the son, lascivious.
He is the one desacralizer.
He is the son of the enticer.
The all seeing subterranean kaiser.
He is the way, he is the way.

I am the way.
And you invited me to stay.
However fair and pure, you crave the wand.
You see through me what lies beyond.

I am the one, lascivious.
I am the one, lascivious.

I am the one, lascivious.
With magic potion niveous.

Ghuleh, Ghuleh.
Ghuleh, Ghuleh.

Putrefaction, a scent that cursed be.
Undercoat of dust.
From the darkness, rise as succubus.
From the earthen rust.

Haeresis Dea, once a majesty.
Now, exposing bone.
From the darkness, rise as succubus.
And usurp the throne.
The moon is full and shines an evil.
Blinding light.
Under a monolith, her likeness.
Marble white.

Zombie Queen, Zombie Queen.
Black light guides you, Ghuleh, Ghuleh.
Zombie Queen, Zombie Queen.
Black light guides you, Ghuleh, Ghuleh.

Up from the stinking dirt, she rises.
Ghastly pale.
Shapeshifting soon, but now she's rigid.
Stiff and stale.

Zombie Queen, Zombie Queen.
Black light guides you, Ghuleh, Ghuleh.
Zombie Queen, Zombie Queen.
Black light guides you, Ghuleh, Ghuleh.
Zombie Queen, Zombie Queen.
Black light guides you, Ghuleh, Ghuleh.
Belial, Behemoth, Beelzebub.
Asmodeus, Satanas, Lucifer.
Belial, Behemoth, Beelzebub.
Asmodeus, Satanas, Lucifer.

Since dawn of time the fate of man is that of lice.
Equal as parasites and moving without eyes.
A day of reckoning when penance is to burn.
Countdown together now and say the words.
That you will learn.

Hell Satan, Archangelo.
Hell Satan, welcome Year Zero.
Hell Satan, Archangelo.
Hell Satan, welcome Year Zero.

Belial, Behemoth, Beelzebub.
Asmodeus,﻿ Satanas, Lucifer.

Crestfallen kings and queens comforting in their faith.
Unbeknownst to them is the presence of the Wraith.
Since fate of man is equal to the fate of lice.
As new dawn rises, you shalt recognize.
Now, behold the Lord of Flies.

Hell Satan, Archangelo.
Hell Satan, welcome Year Zero.
Hell Satan.
He will tremble the nations.
Kingdoms to fall one by one.
Victim to fall for temptations.
A daughter to fall for a son.
The ancient serpent deceiver.
To masses standing in awe.
He will ascend to the heavens.
Above the stars of God.

Hell Satan, Archangelo.
Hell Satan, welcome Year Zero.
Hell Satan, Archangelo.
Hell Satan, welcome Year Zero.
This grave hill stinks of death.
A reek from the ground catches whiff of the hound.
A dead one's breath.
The casket lid is cold.
Waiting inside is someone petrified.
That odor's old.

His body and blood, sharing in common, his body and blood.
His body and blood, serving Messiah, huh.
His body and blood, sharing in common, his body and blood.
His body and blood, serving Messiah, Son of God.

The bitter taste is sweet.
So eat Nazarene and you kiss the obscene.
Anointed feet.

His body and blood, sharing in common, his body and blood.
His body and blood, serving Messiah, huh.
His body and blood, sharing in common, his body and blood.
His body and blood, serving Messiah, Son of God.

Receive, consume.
Receive, consume.
Digest.
Defecate.
His body and blood, sharing in common, his body and blood.
His body and blood, serving Messiah, Son of God.
Profaner of the vices, a simple charlatan.
Inflaming puerile minds with the guilt of sin.
Imaginations fed to children, it has served me well.
That the bowels of the Earth hides the pits of Hell.

Idolatrine for the imbeciles, Idolatrine.
Idolatrine for the debiles and the simpletons.
Disciples of the watch awaits at my command.

Lord of silence.
Desolated one.
Vengeance is his.

An existence as a human is leaden monotony.
With all desires drowned impure sanctimony.

Idolatrine for the imbeciles, Idolatrine.
Idolatrine for the debiles and the simpletons.
Disciples of the watch awaits at my command.

Suffer little children to come unto me.
Suffer little children to come unto me.
Suffer little children grant me sovereignty.
Suffer little, little, princes and princesses.
Idolatrine for the imbeciles, Idolatrine.
Idolatrine for the debiles and the simpletons.
Disciples of the watch awaits at my command.

Suffer little children to come unto me.
Suffer little children to come unto me.
Suffer little children grant me sovereignty.
Suffer little, little, princes and princesses.
Through scapes of murmur, noisy walls of sound.
Without a starlit night, shores nowhere to be found.
On seas of wonder ye confused strays.
Without a guiding light you see no ways.

Into the eyes of fire, into the gaze ablaze.
Into the burning light of Satan's rays.
Into the source of wisdom, beyond the Bible lies.
Into the endless depth of Satan's eyes.

Spiral and pulsating.
His eyes are enthralling.
His eyes' like a vortex.
A well in which you're falling.
Ah, ah, ah.
Ah, ah, ah.
Ah, ah, ah.

The swamp of feces that is the world.
Flatulates a whirl windstorm in which you swirl.
In disarray, you ponder your soul malaise.
Abandon the long-lost man your child portrays.
Into the eyes of fire, into the gaze ablaze.
Into the burning light of Satan's rays.
Into the source of wisdom, beyond the Bible lies.
Into the endless depth of Satan's eyes.
Into the eyes of fire, into the gaze ablaze.
Into the burning light of Satan's rays.
Into the source of wisdom, beyond the Bible lies.
Into the endless depth of Satan's eyes.
Into the eyes of fire, into the gaze ablaze.
Into the burning light of Satan's rays.
Into the source of wisdom, beyond the Bible lies.
Look into the endless depth of Satan's eyes.
To the sound of the monstrance clock, air is cleansed, assembled flock.
Black candles burn, all minds aligned.

To the sound of the monstrance clock, air is cleansed, assembled flock.
Black candles burn, all minds aligned.
As the parish sighs in smoke, enters lady revealed of cloak.
To the haunting sound of the monstrance clock, singing.

Come together, together as a one.
Come together for Lucifer's son.

To the sound of the end of day, mesmerized, the assembled sway.
Black candles burn, all minds aligned.
Hypnotizing horns of ram, paralyzing pentagram.
And the eerie sound of the monstrance clock, singing.

Come together, together as a one.
Come together for Lucifer's son.
Come together, together as a one.
Come together for Lucifer's son.
Come together, together as a one.
Come together for Lucifer's son.
Come together, together as a one.
Come together for Lucifer's son.
Come together, together as one.
Come together for Lucifer's son.
Come together (Come together), together as one.
Come together (Come together) for Lucifer's son (For Lucifer's son)
Come together (Come together), together as one.
Come together (Come together) for Lucifer's son (For Lucifer's son)
Come together (Come together), together as a one.
Come together (Come together), forever as one (Forever as one)
