As soon as I am left alone.
The devil wanders into my soul.
And I pretend to myself.
And I pretend to myself.

I go out to the old milestone.
Insanely expecting.
You to come there.
Knowing that I wait for you there.
That I wait for you there.

Come! Come!
Come here at once!
Come! Come!
On a night with no moon.
Because all of my being is now in pining.
All of my being is now in pining.

What formerly had cheered me.
Now seems insignificant.
Insignificant.
Dear darkness, dear darkness.
Won't you cover, cover me again?
Dear darkness, dear...
I've been your friend for many years.

Won't you do this for me?
Dearest darkness.
And cover me from the sound.
Of the words tightening.
The words are tightening.
Around my throat, and….

And around the throat of the one I love.
Tightening, tightening, tightening.
Around the throat of the one I love.
Tightening, tightening, tightening.

Dear darkness, dear darkness.
Now it's your time to look after us.
'Cause we kept you clothed.
We kept you in business.
When everyone else was having good luck.

So now it's your time.
Time to pay.
To pay me and the one I love.
With the worldly goods you've stashed away.
With all the things you took from us.
I sowed a seed.
Underneath the oak tree.
I trod it in.
With my boots I trampled it down.

Grow, grow, grow, grow.

I sowed a rose.
Underneath the oak grove.
With my boots on the ground.
Into the earth I trampled it down.

Grow, grow.

Teach me how to...
Teach me how to...

Teach me, mummy.
How to grow.
How to catch someone's fancy.
Underneath the twisted oak grove.
The ceiling is moving.
Moving in time.
Like a conveyor belt.
Above my eyes.
When under ether.
The mind comes alive.
But conscious of nothing.
But the will to survive.
I lay on the bed.
Waist down undressed.
Look up at the ceiling.
Feeling happiness.

Human kindness.

The woman beside me.
Is holding my hand.
I point at the ceiling.
She smiles, so kind.
Something's inside me.
Unborn and unblessed.
Disappears in the ether.
This world to the next.
Disappears in the ether.
One world to the next.

Human kindness.
White chalk hills are all I’ve known.
White chalk hills will rot my bones.
White chalk sticking to my shoes.
White chalk playing as a child with you.

White chalk south against time.
White chalk cutting down the sea at Lyme.
I walk the valleys by the Cerne.
On a path cut fifteen hundred years ago.

And I know these chalk hills will rot my bones.

Dorset’s cliffs meet at the sea.
Where I walked, our unborn child in me.
White chalk, gorse-scattered land.
Scratch my palms – there’s blood on my hands.
Please don't reproach me.
For, for how empty.
My life has become.

I don't know what really happened.
I watched your disappointment.
At being misunderstood.

I forgive you.

Oh, something metal.
Tearing my stomach out.
If you think ill of me.

Can you.
Can you.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Can you.
Can you.
Forgive me.
Too.
Too.

I tried to learn your language.
But fell asleep half undressed.
Unrecognizable to myself.
All those places.
Where I recall.
The memories that grip me.
And pin me down.

I go to these places.
Pretending to think.
I can think of nothing.
But anticipate.

Somehow expect you'll.
Find me there.
That by some miracle.
You'd be aware.

I'd risen this morning.
Determined to break.
The spell of my longing.
And not to think.

I freed myself from my family.
I freed myself from work.
I freed myself, I freed myself.
And remained alone.

And in my thinking.
Steal you away.
Though you never wanted me.
Anyway.

Silence, silence.
Silence, silence.
Silence, silence.
Silence, silence.
Oh grandmother.
How I miss you.
Under the earth.
Wish I was with you.

To talk to you.
To talk to you.

I found somebody.
Tried to give myself to.
Many times.
I wanted to talk to you.

If I lay on the earth.
Could you hear?

Oh grandmother.
I'm so lonely.
All my life.

If I lay on the earth.
Could you hear?

If I lay...
Mary...
Hit her with a hammer.
Teeth smashed in.
Red tongues twitching.
Look inside a skeleton.

My fingers sting.
Where I feel your fingers have been.
Ghostly fingers.
Moving my limbs.

Oh god I miss you.
Oh god I miss you.
Oh god I miss you.
Oh god I miss you.
Oh god I miss you.

Daddy's in the corner.
Rattling his keys.
Mommy's in the doorway.
Trying to leave.

Nobody's listening.
Nobody's listening.
Nobody's listening.
Nobody's listening.
Nobody's listening.
Nobody's listening.
Nobody's listening.
Nobody's listening.
Nobody's listening.
Nobody's listening.
Nobody's listening.
Oh god I miss you.
Oh god I miss you.
Oh god I miss you.
Oh god I miss you.
Oh god I miss you.
Oh god I miss you.
Oh god I miss you.
Oh god I miss you.
Oh god I miss you.
Farewell my friends.
Farewell my dear ones.
If I was rude.
Forgive my weakness.

Goodbye my friends.
Goodbye to evening parties.
Remember me.
In the spring.

To work for your bread.
Soon you must leave.
Remember your families.
And work for your children.

I don't need much.
And the older I become.
I realise.
My friendships.

Will carry me over.
Any course of distance.
Any cause of sorrow.
The friends that last.

Will dance one more time.
With me.
I don't need much.
But this I need.
Above the mountain.
The mountain.
An eagle.
Is flying.

High above the mountain.
An eagle calling down.
To the soldier who falters.
The soldier on the ground.

By the mountain.
I feel nothing.
For in my own heart.
Every tree is broken.

The first tree will not blossom.
The second will not grow.
The third is almost fallen.
Since you betrayed me so.

Since you.
