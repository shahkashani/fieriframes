Clipside of the pink eye flight.
I'm not the percent you think survives.
I need sanctuary in the pages of this book.
Gestating with all the other rats.
Nurse said that my skin will need a graft.
I am of pock marked shapes, the vermin you need to loathe.
Now I'm lost.
Now I'm lost.
Now I'm lost.
Now I'm lost.

Last night I heard lepers.
Flinch like birth defects.
Its musk was fecal in origin.
As the words dribbled off of its chin.
Which said "I'm lost, I'm lost".

Now I'm lost.
Now I'm lost.
Now I'm lost.

Dolls wreck the minced meat of pupils.
Cast in oblong arms length.
The hooks have been picking their scabs.
Where wolves hide in the company of men.
Which said "I'm lost, I'm lost".

Now I'm lost.
Now I'm lost.
Now I'm lost.

Are you peaking in the red?
Perforated at the neck.
What of this mongrel architect.
A broken arm of sewers set.
Past present and future tense.
Clip side of the pink eyed fountain.

You'll be the first.
And last to know.
Aaah.
You'll never know.
Aaah.

Transient jet lag.
Ecto mimed bison.
This is the haunt of roulette dares.
Ruse of metacarpi.
Caveat emptor.
To all that enter here.

Open wrists talk back again in the wounded of its skin.
They'll pinprick the witness in ritual contrition.
The AM trinity fell upon asphyxia-derailed.
In the rattles of.
Made its way through the tracks of a snail slouching whisper.
A half-ass commute through umbilical blisters.
Specter will lurk, radar has gathered.
Midnight neuces from boxcar cadavers.

Exoskeletal junction at the railroad delayed.

Cranial bleeding.
Leeches train the living.
Cursed are those who speak its name.

Rattling the laughter, hinges splintering inside.
Bludgeoned to a saddle, rang the cloister bell inside.
Oh, oh, oh.

You've got the lot to burn.
A shelve of pig-smothered cries.
Is there a spirit that spits.
Upon the exit of signs?
Is anybody there? (Spined in a row)
These steps keep on growing long (Spined as an arrow)
Bayonet trials.
Rust propellers await.

Nobody is heard.
Rowing sheep smiles for the dead.
Nobody is heard.

An antiquated home.
Afloat with engines on mute.
Sui generis ship spined around the yard.
Is anybody there? (Spined in a row)
These craft only multiply (Spined as an arrow)
At the nape of ruins.
Rust propellers await.
No.

Nobody is heard.
Compass wilting in the wind.
(kcab nrut t'nod, kcab nrut t'nod, kcab nrut t'nod)
Nobody is heard.
Rowing sheep smile for the dead.
Trans-oceanic depths in this earth.
In this cenotaph.

Lash of a thousand eye-brows clicking.
Counting the toll, counting the toll.

And there are those who.
Hadn't found the speaking so wrong.
Is it wrong?
Of Pavlov lore.
They ran rampant through the floors; is this wrong?
Feels so wrong.
Happened on a respirator.
In the basement; are they gone?
Are they gone?

Strung the slang of a gallows bird.
Rationed a dead letter pure.

Track-marked amoeba lands craft; cartwheel of scratches.
Dress the tapeworm as pet.
Tentacles smirk please; flinched the cocooned meat.
Infra-recon forget.

Now there are those who find.
Comfort in the breathing wrong.
Is it wrong?
It houses the watchful eyes.
They're panting in a pattern in droves.
Are they gone?
Happened on a respirator.
In the basement; is it gone?
Are they gone?

Strung the slang of a gallows bird.
Sanctioned a dead letter pure.

Track-marked amoeba lands craft, cartwheel of scratches.
Dress the tapeworm as pet.
Tentacles smirk please; flinched the cocooned meat.
Infra-recon forget.

Evaporated the fur, because it covers them.
If you only knew the plans they had for us.

They used to have pulses in them.
But impulse has made them strong.

Are you just growing old?
Track-marked amoeba lands craft; cartwheel of scratches.
Dress the tapeworm as pet.
Do you recall its name.
As if suggested beck and call.
This face and heel.
Will drag your halo through the mud ash of Pompeii.
Erupted in a statue's dust.
Shrouded in veils.
Because these handcuffs hurt too much.
Still scalping this ticketless applause.
And when they drag the lake.
There's nothing left at all.

Sutured contusion.
Beyond the anthills of the dawning of this plague.
Said, "I've lost my way".
Even if this cul-de-sac would pay.
To reach inside a vault.
Whatever be the cost.
Sterling-clear blackened-ice.
And when they drag the lake.
There's nothing left at all.

I've defected.

Even if you, even if you, even if you.
Who reached inside a vault.
Whatever be the cost.
Sterling-clear blackened-ice.

You came here on time.
I just hope that it's not too late.
I've seen you at night.
Biting the frost of silence.
Can you cure us of this fate.
Mock the litany in its face.
Is that you Moatilliatta.

This is the altar.
The one that you let me die in.
On your knees.
How you wept.
Much like Omertà.
The quiet has shielded all intent.
On the ground it appears.
Like a wrath.
Avenging the lamb as bait.
In a bed of nails you made.
Who is this effigy.
Is there straw dressed in these fields.
And now it won't be long.

Just as he hit.
The ground.
They lowered a tow that.
Stuck in his neck to the gills.
Fragments of sobriquets.
Riddle me this.
Three half eaten corneas.
Who hit the aureole.
Stalk the ground.
Stalk the ground.

You should have seen.
The curse that flew right by you.
Page of concrete.
Stained walks crutch in hobbled sway.
Auto-da-fé.
A capillary hint of red.
Only this manupod.
Crescent in shape has escaped.

The house half the way.
Fell empty with teeth.
That split both his lips.
Mark these words.
One day this chalk outline will circle this city.
Was he robbed of the asphalt that cushioned his face?
A room colored charlatan.
Hid in a safe.
Stalk the ground.

Everyone knows the last toes are.
Always the coldest to go.
You must have been phlegmatic in stature.
The gates of Thanos are-a spread eagle wide.
You let the shutters make sackcloth and ashes.
Out of a blind man's picaresque heart.

You take the veil.
You take the dive.
You take the veil.

It's not over till the tremulant sings.
These ides of March, are they so make believe?
How tempts the revenant.
Slice up and not across.

You take the veil.
You take the dive.
You take the veil.

A mass of gallon sloth (They're gonna get you)
As flies have walls for feet.
A rapturous verbatim (You better run now)
Someone said, but who's to know?
And when you find the fringe (They won't let you)
The one last hit that spent you.
You'll find the ossuary (You better fight now)
Spilling by the day.
Iconoclastic had it coming for years.
They know the prisons you have yet to fear.
Where thumbs hide inside of sleeping bag mouths.
Ad-libbing memoirs, casting a drought.

Oh! Virulent hives of bedpost piles.
Virulent hives, virulent hives.
Who brought me here?
Forsaken, deprived and wrought with fear.
Who turned it off?
The last thing I remember now.
