All my life is on me now.
Hail the pages turning.
And the future's on the bound.
Hell don't know my fury.

You're all I need, you're all I need.
You're all I need, you're all I need.
You're all I need, you're all I need.
You're all I need and maybe some faith would do me good.

I don't know what I'm doing, don't know, should I change my mind?
I can't decide, there's too many variations to consider.
No thing I do don't do no thing but bring me more to do.
It's true, I do imbue my blue unto myself, I make it bitter.

Baby, lay your head on my lap one more time.
Tell me you belong to me.
Baby, say that it's all gonna be alright.
I believe that it isn't.

You're all I need, you're all I need.
You're all I need, you're all I need.
You're all I need, you're all I need.
You're all I need and maybe some faith would do me good.
Here's another speech you wish I'd swallow.
Another cue for you to fold your ears.
Another train of thought too hard to follow.
Chuggin' along to a song that belongs to the shifting of gears.

Please forgive me for my distance.
The pain is evident in my existence.
Please forgive me for my distance.
The shame is manifest in my resistance.
To your love.
To your love.
To your love.

I would've warned you but really what's the point.
Caution could but rarely ever helps.
Don't be down, my demeanor tends to disappoint.
It's hard enough even trying to be civil to myself.

Please forgive me for my distance.
The pain is evident in my existence.
Please forgive me for my distance.
The shame is manifest in my resistance.
To your love.
To your love.
To your love.

My derring-do allows me to.
Dance the rigadoon around you.
But by the time I'm close to you.
I lose my desideratum and now you.

So now you have it, so tell me baby what's the word.
Am I your gal or should I get out of town.
I just need to be reassured.
Do you just deal it out or can you deal with all that I lay down?

Please forgive me for my distance.
The pain is evident in my existence.
Please forgive me for my distance.
The shame is manifest in my resistance.
To your love.
To your love.
To your love.

To your love.
To your love.
To your love.
To your love.
To your love.
You wanna make me sick;
You wanna lick my wounds.
Don't you, baby?
You want the badge of honour when you save my hide.
But you're the one in the way.
Of the day of doom, baby.
If you need my shame to reclaim your pride.

And when I think of it, my fingers turn to fists.
I never did anything to you, man.
But no matter what I try, you'll beat me with your bitter lies.
So call me crazy, hold me down.
Make me cry; get off now, baby.
It won't be long till you'll be lying limp in your own hands.

You feed the beast I have within me.
You wave the red flag, baby you make it run run run.
Standing on the sidelines, waving and grinning.
You fondle my trigger, then you blame my gun.

And when I think of it, my fingers turn to fists.
I never did anything to you, man.
But no matter what I try, you'll beat me with your bitter lies.
So call me crazy, hold me down.
Make me cry; get off now, baby.
It won't be long till you'll be lying limp in your own hands.
And when I think of it, my fingers turn to fists.
I never did anything to you, man.
But no matter what I try, you'll beat me with your bitter lies.
So call me crazy, hold me down.
Make me cry; get off now, baby.
It won't be long till you'll be lying limp in your own hands.
Love ridden, I've looked at you.
With the focus I gave to my birthday candles.
I've wished on the lidded blue flames under your brow.
And, baby, I wished for you.

Nobody sees when you are lyin' in your bed.
And I wanna crawl in with you but I cry instead.
I want your warm but it will only make me colder when it's over.
So I can't tonight, baby.

No, not "baby" anymore.
If I need you, I'll just use your simple name.
Only kisses on the cheek from now on.
And in a little while we'll only have to wave.

My hand won't hold you down no more.
The path is clear to follow through.
I stood too long in the way of the door.
And now I'm giving up on.
You.

No, not "baby" anymore.
If I need you, I'll just use your simple name.
Only kisses on the cheek from now on.
And in a little while we'll only have to wave.

No, not "baby" anymore.
If I need you, I'll just use your simple name.
Only kisses on the cheek from now on.
And in a little while we'll only have to wave.
I was staring at the sky, just looking for a star.
To pray on, or wish on, or something like that.
I was having a sweet fix of a daydream of a boy.
Whose reality I knew, was a-hopeless to be had.
But then the dove of hope began its downward slope.
And I believed for a moment that my chances.
Were approaching to be grabbed.
But as it came down near, so did a weary tear.
I thought it was a bird, but it was just a paper bag.

Hunger hurts, and I want him so bad, oh it kills.
'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up.
I got to fold cause these hands are too shaky to hold.
Hunger hurts, but starving works, when it costs too much to love.

And I went crazy again today.
Looking for a strand to climb, looking for a little hope.
Baby said he couldn't stay.
Wouldn't put his lips to mine and a fail to kiss is a fail to cope.
I said, "Honey, I don't feel so good, don't feel justified.
Come on put a little love here in my void,".
He said "It's all in your head,".
And I said, "So's everything" but he didn't get it.
I thought he was a man but he was just a little boy.

Hunger hurts, and I want him so bad, oh it kills.
'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up.
I got to fold cause these hands are too shaky to hold.
Hunger hurts, but starving works.
When it costs too much to love.
Hunger hurts but I want him so bad, oh it kills.
'Cause I know I'm a mess that he don't wanna clean up.
I got to fold because these hands are just too shaky to hold.
Hunger hurts, but starving works me.
When it costs too much to love.
Oh, hunger hurts but I want him so bad, oh it kills.
'Cause I know I'm a mess that he don't wanna clean up.
I got to fold because these hands are just too shaky to hold.
Hunger hurts, but starving, it works.
When it costs too much to love, hmm hmm.
I'm gonna make a mistake.
I'm gonna do it on purpose.
I'm gonna waste my time.
Cause I'm full as a tick.
And I'm scratching at the surface.
And what I find is mine.
And when the day is done and I look back.
And the fact is I had fun.
Fumbling around.
All the advice I shunned and I ran.
Where they told me not to run.
But I sure had fun.
So I'm gonna fuck it up again.
I'm gonna do another detour.
Unpave my path.
And if you wanna make sense.
Whatcha lookin' at me for?
I'm no good at math.
And when I find my way back.
The fact is I just may stay.
Or I may not.

I've acquired quite a taste.
For a well-made mistake.
I wanna make a mistake.
Why can't I make a mistake?

I'm always doing what I think I should.
Almost always doing everybody good.
Why?

Do I wanna do right?
Of course.
But do I really wanna feel I'm forced to answer you?
Hell no.

I've acquired quite a taste.
For a well-made mistake.
I wanna make a mistake.
Why can't I make a mistake?

I'm always doing what I think I should.
Almost always doing everybody good.
Why?
I let the beast in too soon.
I don't know how to live without my hand on his throat.
I fight him always and still.
Oh darling, it's so sweet.
You think you know how crazy.
How crazy I am.
You say you don't spook easy.
You won't go.
But I know.
And I pray that you will.

Fast as you can, baby.
Run, free yourself of me.
Fast as you can.

I may be soft in your palm.
But I'll soon grow hungry for a fight.
And I will not let you win.
My pretty mouth will frame the phrases.
That will disprove your faith in man.
So if you catch me trying to find my way into your heart.
From under your skin.

Fast as you can, baby.
Scratch me out, free yourself.
Fast as you can.
Fast as you can, baby.
Scratch me out, free yourself.
Fast as you can.

Sometimes my mind don't shake and shift.
But most of the time, it does.
And I get to the place where I'm begging for a lift.
Or I'll drown in the wonders and the was.
And I'll be your girl, if you say it's a gift.
And you give me some more of your drugs.
Yeah, I'll be your pet, if you just tell me it's a gift.
Cause I'm tired of whys, choking on whys.
Just need a little because, because.

I let the beast in and then.
I even tried forgiving him, but it's too soon.
So I'll fight again, again, again, again, again.
And for a little while more.
I'll soar the uneven wind, complain and blame the sterile land.
But if you're getting any bright ideas, quiet dear.
I'm blooming within.

Fast as you can, baby, wait, watch me; I'll be out.
Fast as I can, maybe late but at least about.
Fast as you can, leave me, let this thing run its route.

Fast as you can.
Fast as you can.
Fast as you can.
Fast as you can.
I wouldn't know what to do with another chance.
If you gave it to me.
I couldn't take the embrace of a real romance.
It'd race right through me.

I'm much better off the way things are.
Much much better off, better by far, by far.

I wouldn't know what to say to a gentle voice.
It'd roll right past me.
And if you chalk it up you'll see I don't really have a choice.
So don't even ask me.

I'm much better off, the way things are.
Much much better off, better by far, by far.

So keep on calling me names, keep on, keep on.
And I'll keep kicking the crap till it's gone.
If you keep on killing, you could get me to settle.
And as soon as I settle.
I bet I'll be able to move on.

How can I fight, when we're on the same side?
How can I fight beside you?

So keep on calling me names, keep on, keep on.
And I'll keep kicking the crap till it's gone.
If you keep on killing, you could get me to settle.
And as soon as I settle.
I bet I'll be able to move on.

Keep on calling me names, keep on, keep on.
And I'll keep kicking the crap till it's gone.
If you keep on killing, you could get me to settle.
And as soon as I settle.
I bet I'll be able to move on.
How many times do I have to say.
To get away, get gone?
Flip your shit past another lass's.
Humble dwelling.
You got your game, made your shot.
And you got away with a lot.
But I'm not turned on.
So put away that meat you're selling.

Cause I do know what's good for me.
And I've done what I could for you.
But you're not benefiting.
And yet I'm sitting.
Singing again, sing, sing again.

How can I deal with this.
If he won't get with this?
Am I gonna heal from this?
He won't admit to it.
Nothing to figure out.
I gotta get him out.
It's time the truth was out.
That he don't give a shit about me.

Cause I do know what's good for me.
And I've done what I could for you.
But you're not benefiting.
And yet I'm sitting.
Singing again, sing, sing again.

How can I deal with this.
If he won't get with this?
Am I gonna heal from this?
He won't admit to it.
Nothing to figure out.
I gotta get him out.
It’s time the truth was out.
That he don't give a shit about me.

How many times can it escalate.
Till it elevates to a place I can't breathe?
And I must decide, if you must deride.
That I'm much obliged to up and go.
I'll idealize, then realize.
That it's no sacrifice because the price is paid.
And there's nothing left to grieve.
Fuckin' go.

Cause I've done what I've could for you.
And I do know what's good for me.
And I'm not benefiting.
Instead I'm sitting.
Singing again, singing again, singing again.
Sing, sing again.

How can I deal with this.
If he won't get with this?
Am I gonna heal from this?
He won't admit to it.
Nothing to figure out.
I gotta get him out.
It's time the truth was out.
That he don't give a shit about me.
How can I deal with this.
If he won't get with this?
Am I gonna heal from this?
He won't admit to it.
Nothing to figure out.
I gotta get him out.
It's time the truth was out.
That he don't give a shit about me.
So be it, I’m your crowbar.
If that’s what I am so far.
Until you get out of this mess.
And I will pretend.
That I don’t know of your sins.
Until you are ready to confess.
But all the time, all the time.
I’ll know, I’ll know.

And you can use my skin.
To bury secrets in.
And I will settle you down.
And at my own suggestion.
I will ask no questions.
While I do my thing in the background.
But all the time, all the time.
I’ll know, I’ll know.

Baby.
I can't help you out.
While she is still around.

So for the time being, I'm being patient.
And amidst this bitterness.
If you'll just consider this.
Even if it don’t make sense all the time.
Give it time.
And when the crowd becomes your burden.
And you've early closed your curtain.
I'll wait by the backstage door.

While you try to find.
The lines to speak your mind.
And pry it open, hoping for an encore.
And if it gets too late, for me to wait.
For you to find you love me, and tell me so.
It’s ok, don’t need to say it.
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup.
They slither while they pass they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind.
Possessing and caressing me.
Jai guru de va om.

Nothing's gonna change my world.
Nothing's gonna change my world.
Nothing's gonna change my world.
Nothing's gonna change my world.

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes.
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they.
Tumble blindly as they make their way.
Across the universe.
Jai guru deva om.

Nothing's gonna change my world.
Nothing's gonna change my world.
Nothing's gonna change my world.
Nothing's gonna change my world.

Sounds of laughter, shades of earth are ringing.
Through my open ears inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a.
Million suns and calls me on and on.
Across the universe.
Jai guru deva om.

Nothing's gonna change my world.
Nothing's gonna change my world.
Nothing's gonna change my world.
Nothing's gonna change my world.

Jai guru deva.
Jai guru deva.
Jai guru deva.
Jai guru deva.
Jai guru deva.
Jai guru deva.
Jai guru deva.
When the pawn hits the conflicts he thinks like a king.
What he knows throws the blows when he goes to the fight.
And he'll win the whole thing 'fore he enters the ring.
There's nobody to batter when your mind is your might.
So when you go solo you hold your own hand.
And remember that depth is the greatest of heights.
And if you know where you stand then you know where to land.
And if you fall it won't matter 'cause you'll know that you're right.
