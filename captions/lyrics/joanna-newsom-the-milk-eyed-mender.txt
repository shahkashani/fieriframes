We sailed away on a winter's day.
With fate as malleable as clay.
But ships are fallible, I say.
And the nautical, like all things, fades.
And I can recall our caravel:
A little wicker beetle shell.
With four fine maste and lateen sails.
Its bearings on Cair Paravel.

O my love.
O it was a funny little thing.
To be the ones to've seen.

The sight of bridges and balloons.
Makes calm canaries irritable;
They caw and claw all afternoon:
"Catenaries and dirigibles.
Brace and buoy the living-room—
A loom of metal, warp—woof—wimble".
And a thimbles worth of milky moon.
Can touch hearts larger than a thimble.

O my love.
O it was a funny little thing.
To be the ones to've seen.
O my love.
O it was a funny little thing.
It was a funny, funny little thing.
I slept all day.
Awoke with distaste.
And I railed.
And I raved.

That the difference between.
The sprout and the bean.
It is a golden ring.
It is a twisted string.
And you can ask the counselor;
And you can ask the king;
And I'll say the same thing;
And it's a funny thing:

Should we go outside?
Should we go outside?
Should we break some bread?
Are y'interested?

And as I said.
I slept as though dead.
Dreaming seamless dreams of lead.

When you go away.
I am big-boned and fey.
In the dust of the day.
In the dirt of the day.

And Danger! Danger! Drawing near them was a white coat.
And Danger! Danger! Drawing near them was a broad boat.
And the water! water! Running clear beneath a white throat.
And the hollow chatter of the talking of the Tadpoles.

Who know th'outside!
Should we go outside?
Should we break some bread?
Are y'interested?
We should shine a light on.
A light on.
And the book of right-on's right on.
It was right on.
We should shine a light on.
A light on.
And the book of right-on's right on.
It was right on.

I killed my dinner with karate.
Kick 'em in the face, taste the body.
Shallow work is the work that I do.
Do you want to sit at my table?
My fighting fame is fabled.
And fortune finds me fit and able.
And you do say oh.
That you do pray.
And you say.
That you're ok.

Do you want to run with my pack?
Do you want to ride on my back?
Pray that what you lack does not distract.
And even when you run through my mind.
Something else is in front, oh, you're behind.
And I don't have to remind you.
To stick with your kind.
And you do say oh.
That you do pray.
And you say.
That you're ok.

And even when you touch my face.
You know your place.
And even when you touch my face.
You know your place.

And we should shine a light on.
A light on.
And the book of right-on's right on.
It was right on.
And we should shine a light on.
A light on.
And the book of right-on's right on.
It was right on.
Sadie, white coat.
You carry me home.
And bury this bone.
And take this pine-cone.

Bury this bone to gnaw on it later;
Gnawing on the telephone.
And 'till then, we pray and suspend.
The notion that these lives do never end.

And all day long we talk about mercy:
Lead me to water, Lord, I sure am thirsty.
Down in the ditch where I nearly served you.
Up in the clouds where he almost heard you.

And all that we built.
And all that we breathed.
And all that we spilt, or pulled up like weeds.
Is piled up in back.
And it burns irrevocably.
And we spoke up in turns.
'Till the silence crept over me.

And bless you.
And I deeply do.
No longer resolute.
And I call to you.

But the water.
Got so cold.
And you do lose.
What you don't hold.

This is an old song, these are old blues.
And this is not my tune, but it's mine to use.
And the seabirds where the fear once grew.
Will flock with a fury.
And they will bury what'd come for you.

And down where I darn with the milk-eyed mender.
You and I, and a love so tender.
Stretched on a hoop where I stitch - this adage:
"Bless our house and its heart so savage".

And all that I want.
And all that I need.
And all that I've got is scattered like seed.
And all that I knew is moving away from me.
And all that I know is blowing.
Like tumbleweed.

And the mealy worms.
In the brine will burn.
In a salty pyre.
Among the fauns and ferns.

And the love we hold.
And the love we spurn.
Will never grow cold.
Only taciturn.

And I'll tell you tomorrow.
Sadie, go on home now.
And bless those who've sickened below.
And bless us who've chosen so.

And all that I've got.
And all that I need.
I tie in a knot and I lay at your feet.
I have not forgot, but a silence crept over me.
So dig up your bone.
Exhume your pine-cone, my Sadie.
Oh, where is your inflammatory writ?
Your text that would incite a light, "Be lit"?
Our music deserving devotion unswerving —
Cry "Do I deserve her?" with unflagging fervor.
(Well, no we do not, if we cannot get over it)

But what's it mean.
When suddenly we're spent?
Tell me true!
Ambition came and reared its head, and went.
Far from you!
Even mollusks have weddings.
Though solemn and leaden.
But you dirge for the dead.
And take no jam on your bread —
Just a supper of salt and a waltz.
Through your empty bed.

And all at once it came to me.
And I wrote and hunched 'till four-thirty.
But that vestal light.
It burns out with the night.
In spite of all the time that we spend on it:
On one bedraggled ghost of a sonnet!
While outside, the wild boars root.
Without bending a bough underfoot —
O it breaks my heart; I don't know how they do't.
So don't ask me!

And as for my inflammatory writ?
Well, I wrote it and I was not inflamed one bit.
Advice from the master derailed that disaster;
He said "Hand that pen over to me, poetaster!".
While across the great plains.
Keening lovely & awful.
Ululate the lost Great American Novels —
An unlawful lot, left to stutter and freeze, floodlit.
(But at least they didn't run.
To their undying credit.)
Svetlana sucks lemons across from me.
And I am progressing abominably.
And I do not know my own way to the sea.
But the saltiest sea knows its own way to me.

And the city that turns, turns protracted and slow.
And I find myself toeing th'Embarcadero.
And I find myself knowing.
The things that I knew.
Which is all that you can know.
On this side of the blue.

And Jaime has eyes.
Black and shiny as boots.
And they march at you two-by-two.
(re-loo re-loo);
When she looks at you.
You know she's nowhere near through:
It's the kindest heart beating.
This side of the blue.

And the signifieds butt heads.
With the signifiers.
And we all fall down slack-jawed.
To marvel at words!
When across the sky sheet the.
Impossible birds, in a steady.
Illiterate movement homewards.

And Gabriel stands beneath forest and moon.
See them rattle & boo.
See them shake, and see them loom.
See him fashion a cap from a page of Camus;
And see him navigate deftly this side of the blue.

And the rest of our lives.
Will the moments accrue.
When the shape of their goneness.
Will flare up anew.
Then we do what we have to do.
(re-loo re-loo)
Which is all that you can do.
On this side of the blue.
Oh, it's all that you can do.
On this side of the blue.
This place is damp and ghostly.
I am already gone.
And the halls were lined with the disembodied.
And dustly wings, which fell from flesh.
Gasplessly.

And I go where the trees go.
And I walk from a higher education.
For now and for hire.

It beats me, but I do not know.
And it beats me but I do not know.
It beats me, but I do not know.
I do not know.

Palaces and storm clouds.
The rough, straggly sage.
And the smoke.
And the way it will all come together.
In quietness and in time.

And you laws of property.
Oh, you free economy.
And you unending afterthoughts.
You could've told me before.

Never get so attached to a poem.
You forget truth that lacks lyricism.
Never draw so close to the heat.
That you forget that you must eat, oh...
Feel the mattress tense beneath me.
Like the muscle of non-sleepy;
Feathers flexing will defeat me.
And it vexes me completely.

And the hexes heat covertly.
Like a slow low-flying turkey.
Like a Texan drying jerky.
But his meaty mitts can't hurt me.

With my steely will compounded.
In a mighty mound that's hounded.
By the snap your steel string sounded.
Just before your snores unwound it.

And in store are dreams so daring.
That the night can't stop from staring.
And I'll swim sweetly as a herring.
Through the ether, not despairing.

Go to sleep, you stunning sky;
Gently creep cunning by.
A quiet hum is amplified.
By your thumb, that you suck dry.

Hundred raging waters.
Snare the lonely sigh.
And you hold your breath.
And clasp at Cassiopeia.

Hundred raging waters.
Snare the lonely sigh.
Hold your breath.
And clasp at Cassiopeia.

Cassiopeia, Cassiopeia.
Oh oh, Cassiopeia.
We speak in the store.
I'm a sensitive bore.
You seem markedly more.
And I'm oozing surprise.
But it's late in the day.
And you're well on your way.
What was golden went gray.
And I'm suddenly shy.

And the gatherin' floozies.
Afford to be choosy.
And all sneezing darkly.
In the dimming divide.
And I have read the right books.
To interpret your looks.
You were knocking me down.
With the palm of your eye.

This was unlike the story.
It was written to be.
I was riding its back.
When it used to ride me.
And we were galloping manic.
To the mouth of the source.
We were swallowing panic.
In the face of its force.

And I am blue.
I am blue and unwell.
Made me bolt like a horse.
Now it's done.
Watch it go.
You've changed some.
Water runs from the snow.

Am I so dear?
Do I run rare?
And you've changed some.
Peach, plum, pear...
Peach, plum...
If you want to come on down.
Down with your bones so white.
Watch the freight trains pound.
Into the wild, wild night.

How I would love to gnaw.
To gnaw on your bones so white.
And watch as the freight trains paw.
Paw at the wild, wild night.

All these ghost towns, wreathed in old loam.
(Assateague knee-deep in seafoam) —
Ho Swansea! Buttonwillow!
Lagunitas! Ho Calico!

And all these beastly bungalows.
Stare, distend, like endless toads —
Endlessly hop down the road.
Borne by wind, we southward blow.

And yonder, wild and blue.
The wild blue yonder looms.
'Till we are wracked with rheum.
By roads, by songs entombed.

And all we want to do.
Is chew, and chew, and chew!
Dear one, drive on.
When all we want to do.
Is chew, and chew, and chew.

And if you want to come on down.
Down with your bones so white.
Watch the freight trains pound.
Into the wild, wild night.

How I would love to gnaw.
To gnaw on your bones so white.
And watch as the freight trains paw.
Paw at the wild, wild night.
Paw at the wild, wild night.
Paw at the wild, wild night.
There was a knight, and a lady bright.
And three little babes had she.
She sent them away, to a far country.
To learn their grammerie.

They hadn't been gone but a very short time.
About three months and a day.
When the lark spread o'er this whole wide world.
And taken those babes away.

It was on a cold, cold Christmas night.
When everything was still.
And she saw her three little babes come running.
Come running down the hill.

She set them a table of bread and wine.
That they might drink and eat;
She spread them a bed of winding sheet.
That they might sleep so sweet.

"Take it off, take it off," cried the eldest one;
"Take it off, take it off," cried she.
"For I shan't stay here, in this wicked world.
When there's a better world for me.".

"Cold clods, cold clods, inside my bed.
Cold clods, down at my feet —
The tears my dear mother shed for me.
Would wet my winding sheet.".

"The tears my dear mother shed for me.
Would wet my winding sheet.
Would wet my winding sheet.".
That means no.
Where I come from.
I am cold, out waiting for the day to come.

I chew my lips, and I scratch my nose.
Feels so good to be a rose.

Oh don't, don't you lift me up.
Like I'm that shy, no no no no no.
Just give it up.
There are bats all dissolving in a row.
Into the wishy-washy dark that cannot let go.
And I cannot let go.
So I thank the lord.
And I thank his sword.
Though it be mincing up the morning, slightly bored.

O, morning without warning like a hole.
And I watch you go.
There are some mornings when the sky looks like a road.
There are some dragons who were built to have and hold.
And some machines are dropped from great heights lovingly.
And some great bellies ache with many bumblebees.
And they sting so terribly.

I do as I please.
Now I'm on my knees.
Your skin is something that I stir into my tea.
And I am watching you.
And you are starry, starry, starry.
And I'm tumbling down, and I check a frown.
It's why I love this town.
Well, just look around.
Just see me serenaded hourly, celebrated sourly.
Dedicated dourly, waltzing with the open sea.
Clam, crab, cockle, cowrie.
Will you just look at me?
