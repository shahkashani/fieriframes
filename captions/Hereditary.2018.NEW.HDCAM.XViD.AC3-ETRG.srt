2
00:02:37,901 --> 00:02:39,817
Come on, Peter.

3
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:43,570
Wake up. Peter. Wake up.

4
00:02:44,994 --> 00:02:46,419
Here's your suit.

5
00:02:50,634 --> 00:02:53,333
Do you know if your sister
slept in her room last night?

6
00:02:54,805 --> 00:02:55,905
I don't know.

7
00:02:58,842 --> 00:03:00,326
Come on, Peter. Get up.

8
00:03:22,892 --> 00:03:26,202
Oh, Charlie.
For God's sake, come on!

9
00:03:28,616 --> 00:03:30,584
It was freezing last night!

10
00:03:30,954 --> 00:03:32,677
That's how you get pneumonia.

11
00:03:32,858 --> 00:03:34,233
That's okay.

12
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,704
Okay, come on.
Let's go. We're late.

13
00:03:36,753 --> 00:03:38,552
Your mother's
in the car already.

14
00:03:49,171 --> 00:03:51,413
Um...

15
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:57,478
It's heartening to see so many
strange new faces here today.

16
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,272
Um, I know my mom
would be very touched

17
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:05,444
and probably a little
suspicious...

18
00:04:05,616 --> 00:04:09,332
um, to see this turnout. So.

19
00:04:13,388 --> 00:04:17,889
My mother was a very secretive
and private woman.

20
00:04:18,119 --> 00:04:19,928
She had private rituals,

21
00:04:20,014 --> 00:04:23,015
private friends,
private anxieties.

22
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,085
It honestly feels
like a betrayal

23
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:27,334
just to be standing here
talking about her.

24
00:04:34,136 --> 00:04:36,736
<i>She was a very difficult woman
to read.</i>

25
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,543
<i>If you ever thought you knew
what was going on with her,</i>

26
00:04:40,584 --> 00:04:42,918
<i>and God forbid
you tried to confront that.</i>

27
00:04:46,772 --> 00:04:48,156
<i>But when her life
was unpolluted,</i>

28
00:04:48,225 --> 00:04:50,659
<i>she could be
the sweetest, warmest,</i>

29
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,712
<i>most loving person
in the world.</i>

30
00:04:54,473 --> 00:04:56,462
She was also
incredibly stubborn,

31
00:04:56,511 --> 00:04:59,066
which maybe, explains me.

32
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,680
You could always count on her
to always have the answer.

33
00:05:05,217 --> 00:05:07,745
And if
she ever was mistaken,

34
00:05:07,805 --> 00:05:10,052
and well,
that was your opinion...

35
00:05:10,087 --> 00:05:14,899
And you were wrong.

36
00:05:38,398 --> 00:05:40,075
There aren't nuts in that?

37
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,057
- No.
- Good.

38
00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:45,435
Does that have nuts? 'Cause
we don't have the EpiPen.

39
00:05:45,437 --> 00:05:46,448
I know.

40
00:06:14,111 --> 00:06:18,196
Hello, Rexy! Good dog.

41
00:06:18,242 --> 00:06:19,806
Shoes off, everybody.

42
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,362
Charlie, shoes off.

43
00:06:30,586 --> 00:06:32,023
It does feel weird.

44
00:06:33,388 --> 00:06:34,588
Yeah.

45
00:06:36,015 --> 00:06:37,435
Should I be sadder?

46
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:41,909
You should be
whatever you are. It'll come.

47
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,475
Hey, how's it going?

48
00:07:05,609 --> 00:07:07,217
Mmm, just working.

49
00:07:08,276 --> 00:07:10,602
Taking a break
from avoiding the show.

50
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:19,524
So, you still toiling away
at the hospice?

51
00:07:19,932 --> 00:07:22,665
Yeah, between this
and the, uh, preschool.

52
00:07:24,474 --> 00:07:27,456
So what's our deadline now?
Seven months?

53
00:07:28,023 --> 00:07:30,790
- Six and a half.
- Ooh, coming up.

54
00:07:32,304 --> 00:07:34,138
Any ideas for titles?

55
00:07:41,938 --> 00:07:42,972
Come in.

56
00:07:44,107 --> 00:07:45,141
Hey...

57
00:07:45,325 --> 00:07:47,291
- Goodnight, kiddo.
- Goodnight.

58
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:53,442
Are you, uh... Are you feeling
okay about everything?

59
00:07:53,528 --> 00:07:55,402
Yeah. Fine.

60
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,516
A little sad?

61
00:07:58,493 --> 00:08:00,865
Mmm...

62
00:08:00,962 --> 00:08:04,088
Yeah, I get it. I know.

63
00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:06,066
- Goodnight.
- Night.

64
00:08:06,122 --> 00:08:07,422
Love you.

65
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:23,636
Who's this?

66
00:08:26,318 --> 00:08:27,650
That's Grandma?

67
00:08:38,556 --> 00:08:40,619
You know
you were her favorite, right?

68
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:44,058
Even when
you were a little baby,

69
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:44,783
she wouldn't let me feed you

70
00:08:44,785 --> 00:08:46,455
because she needed
to feed you.

71
00:08:46,644 --> 00:08:48,169
Drove me crazy.

72
00:08:49,192 --> 00:08:51,200
She wanted me to be a boy.

73
00:08:55,794 --> 00:08:58,195
You know, I was a tomboy
when I was growing up.

74
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:03,017
I hated dresses
and dolls and pink.

75
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,643
Who's gonna take care of me?

76
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,798
Um, excuse me.

77
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,897
You don't think
I'm gonna take care of you?

78
00:09:13,308 --> 00:09:14,855
But when you die.

79
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,131
Well, then...

80
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,908
Dad will take care of you.

81
00:09:23,164 --> 00:09:24,550
Or Peter.

82
00:09:41,308 --> 00:09:43,108
You never cried as a baby.

83
00:09:44,977 --> 00:09:46,477
You know that?

84
00:09:48,196 --> 00:09:49,963
Even when you were born.

85
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:01,069
Did you feel
like you wanted to cry today?

86
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:08,335
You think it might feel
like a relief?

87
00:10:33,664 --> 00:10:35,065
Goodnight, sweetheart.

88
00:12:26,909 --> 00:12:28,155
Mom?

89
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,122
I just scared myself
in the workshop.

90
00:13:12,908 --> 00:13:14,707
With... With what?

91
00:13:19,876 --> 00:13:20,944
No.

92
00:13:42,804 --> 00:13:43,971
Are you done?

93
00:13:45,904 --> 00:13:47,138
Almost.

94
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,815
So, maybe we finish the toy
after the quiz.

95
00:13:51,896 --> 00:13:53,062
What do you think?

96
00:13:55,018 --> 00:13:56,512
- Okay.
- Okay.

97
00:14:05,104 --> 00:14:07,507
Oh, my God! What was that?

98
00:14:21,047 --> 00:14:22,795
So, if we go by the rule

99
00:14:22,849 --> 00:14:26,202
that the hero is undone
by his fatal flaw,

100
00:14:26,253 --> 00:14:28,821
what is Heracles' flaw?

101
00:14:30,016 --> 00:14:31,217
Arrogance.

102
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,806
Okay. Why?

103
00:14:34,224 --> 00:14:36,991
Because he literally refuses
to look at all the signs

104
00:14:37,047 --> 00:14:39,950
that are literally handed
to him the entire play.

105
00:14:40,517 --> 00:14:42,625
Okay, interesting.

106
00:14:42,676 --> 00:14:44,935
So he thinks he has control.

107
00:14:45,011 --> 00:14:46,433
But let's all remember,

108
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:49,564
Sophocles wrote the oracle
so that it was unconditional,

109
00:14:49,626 --> 00:14:53,589
meaning, Heracles never had
any choice, right?

110
00:14:53,657 --> 00:14:56,482
So does that make it
more tragic or less tragic

111
00:14:56,538 --> 00:14:58,788
that if he has a choice?

112
00:14:58,858 --> 00:15:00,831
- Less.
- Okay.

113
00:15:00,928 --> 00:15:02,829
- Why?
- Because.

114
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:07,396
Care to
weigh in, Peter?

115
00:15:09,094 --> 00:15:11,087
Um, about which part?

116
00:15:13,337 --> 00:15:14,426
I think it's more tragic

117
00:15:14,428 --> 00:15:16,202
because if it's all
just inevitable,

118
00:15:16,204 --> 00:15:18,620
then that means that
the characters had no hope.

119
00:15:18,729 --> 00:15:19,530
They never had hope

120
00:15:19,532 --> 00:15:21,418
because they're all just,
like, hopeless.

121
00:15:21,517 --> 00:15:22,378
They're all like pawns

122
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,935
in this horrible,
hopeless machine.

123
00:16:38,894 --> 00:16:40,861
- Hello!
- Hi!

124
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:24,812
Did you go up
in my mom's room?

125
00:17:26,056 --> 00:17:27,189
No.

126
00:17:27,974 --> 00:17:29,773
Mmm. Door was open.

127
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:36,748
Hello?

128
00:17:36,812 --> 00:17:38,393
Sorry. I know it's irrational.

129
00:17:38,456 --> 00:17:40,157
- No problem.
- Thank you.

130
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:43,306
Hey, Dad. It's the cemetery.

131
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,755
About what?

132
00:17:45,612 --> 00:17:46,811
Let me see.

133
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:50,228
Hello? Yes.

134
00:17:57,491 --> 00:17:58,990
What does that mean?

135
00:17:59,737 --> 00:18:01,072
Desecrated?

136
00:18:05,635 --> 00:18:07,337
But it's only been a week.

137
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:13,708
Yes, okay, yes. Sure.

138
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,279
All right. I understand.
Yes...

139
00:18:15,335 --> 00:18:18,241
Uh, why don't I call you back?
Yes. Goodbye.

140
00:18:18,282 --> 00:18:19,416
What was it?

141
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,685
Uh, just some billing crap.

142
00:18:24,968 --> 00:18:27,390
Okay, well, I'm, uh...
I'm gonna go see a movie.

143
00:18:28,516 --> 00:18:29,621
Okay.

144
00:18:57,067 --> 00:18:57,778
He would say

145
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:01,145
"I'm a burden, I'm a burden,
I'm a burden."

146
00:19:05,295 --> 00:19:07,585
And I would
tell him, "No, no."

147
00:19:14,545 --> 00:19:17,451
But yes,
he was a burden.

148
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:21,264
Now we've set aside
some time for any newcomers

149
00:19:21,316 --> 00:19:23,099
who might like to speak.

150
00:19:23,176 --> 00:19:24,873
So, anyone.

151
00:19:24,934 --> 00:19:28,336
If it's your first
or second time with us,

152
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,976
the floor is open.

153
00:19:33,686 --> 00:19:36,577
Yes. Would you like to...

154
00:19:36,645 --> 00:19:37,886
Maybe not.

155
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:41,169
Okay. No pressure.

156
00:19:48,816 --> 00:19:49,949
My name's Annie.

157
00:19:50,176 --> 00:19:51,480
Hi, Annie.

158
00:19:53,161 --> 00:19:55,018
My mom died a week ago.

159
00:19:55,308 --> 00:19:58,495
So I'm just here
for trying it.

160
00:19:59,553 --> 00:20:02,088
I have a lot of resistance
to things like this,

161
00:20:02,206 --> 00:20:05,244
but I came to these
a couple years ago.

162
00:20:05,285 --> 00:20:08,392
Well, I was forced to come
and I guess it, um...

163
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:11,778
I guess it helped. So, um...

164
00:20:14,766 --> 00:20:18,357
My mom was old and she wasn't
all together there at the end.

165
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:20,783
And we were pretty much
estranged before that,

166
00:20:20,785 --> 00:20:23,706
so it really wasn't
a huge blow.

167
00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:29,239
But I did love her.

168
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,120
And she didn't have
an easy life.

169
00:20:32,171 --> 00:20:35,306
She had DID, which became
extreme at the end.

170
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,991
And dementia.

171
00:20:37,093 --> 00:20:41,127
And my father died when I was
a baby from starvation,

172
00:20:41,209 --> 00:20:44,026
um, because he had
psychotic depression

173
00:20:44,096 --> 00:20:44,823
and he starved himself,

174
00:20:44,825 --> 00:20:47,091
which I'm sure was just
as pleasant as it sounds.

175
00:20:47,148 --> 00:20:48,680
And then there's my brother.

176
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,730
My older brother
had schizophrenia

177
00:20:50,794 --> 00:20:52,060
and when he was 16

178
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,835
he hanged himself
in my mother's bedroom

179
00:20:53,897 --> 00:20:55,545
and of course
the suicide note blamed her

180
00:20:55,581 --> 00:20:58,982
accusing her of putting people
inside him. So.

181
00:21:02,724 --> 00:21:04,658
That was my mom's life.

182
00:21:17,116 --> 00:21:18,346
And then she lived
in our house

183
00:21:18,348 --> 00:21:20,062
at the end before hospice.

184
00:21:20,098 --> 00:21:21,616
We weren't even talking
before that.

185
00:21:21,684 --> 00:21:23,679
I mean, we were
and then we weren't.

186
00:21:23,968 --> 00:21:25,573
And then we were.

187
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:30,035
She's completely manipulative.

188
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:33,456
Until my husband finally
enforced a no-contact rule,

189
00:21:33,514 --> 00:21:35,777
which lasted until I got
pregnant with my daughter.

190
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,943
I didn't let her
anywhere near me

191
00:21:36,945 --> 00:21:38,597
when I had my first, my son,

192
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,464
which is why I gave her
my daughter,

193
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,928
who she immediately
stabbed her hooks into.

194
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:46,021
And I just...
I felt guilty again.

195
00:21:46,064 --> 00:21:47,501
I felt guilty again.

196
00:21:47,758 --> 00:21:48,800
When she got sick,

197
00:21:48,802 --> 00:21:51,041
not that she was really even
my mom at the end,

198
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:55,677
and not that she would ever
feel guilty about anything.

199
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:03,827
And I just don't want to put
any more stress on my family.

200
00:22:06,135 --> 00:22:08,456
I'm not even really sure
if they could...

201
00:22:10,034 --> 00:22:11,867
Could give me that support.

202
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,194
And I just...
I just feel like...

203
00:22:20,697 --> 00:22:22,753
I just sometimes
feel like it's all ruined.

204
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:29,719
And then I realize
that I am to blame.

205
00:22:32,327 --> 00:22:33,360
Or not that I'm to blame,

206
00:22:33,405 --> 00:22:38,173
but I am blamed! I'm...

207
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,044
And what do you think
you feel blamed for?

208
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,765
I don't know.

209
00:22:51,782 --> 00:22:52,925
<i>Hey, what's
going on in town</i>

210
00:22:52,927 --> 00:22:54,744
<i>anyway, Mister?
A convention or something?</i>

211
00:22:54,746 --> 00:22:55,453
<i>What?</i>

212
00:22:55,455 --> 00:22:56,684
<i>Well, those clothes
you're wearing.</i>

213
00:22:56,686 --> 00:22:57,661
<i>I talked to a guy this morning</i>

214
00:22:57,663 --> 00:22:59,626
<i>who was wearing
the same kind of outfit.</i>

215
00:22:59,743 --> 00:23:02,016
<i>Maybe it's the guy
you're looking for, huh?</i>

216
00:23:02,018 --> 00:23:03,383
<i>You spoke to him?</i>

217
00:23:03,734 --> 00:23:05,751
<i>What did he tell you?
Where did he go?</i>

218
00:23:05,823 --> 00:23:07,107
<i>Hey, what's the matter
with you?</i>

219
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:08,344
<i>Hey, take your hands off me.</i>

220
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:09,873
<i>You will tell me
what he said to you!</i>

221
00:23:09,927 --> 00:23:10,958
<i>Well why should I?</i>

222
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:12,607
<i>Hey, who do you think
you are anyway?</i>

223
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,166
<i>He came in
with the dog tags!</i>

224
00:23:16,285 --> 00:23:17,450
<i>Wanted to know
about the address</i>

225
00:23:17,452 --> 00:23:18,660
<i>and I told him how to find it.</i>

226
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,700
Where?

227
00:25:24,637 --> 00:25:28,291
Hey, um, do you think
I could maybe borrow

228
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:29,826
one of the cars tonight?

229
00:25:30,085 --> 00:25:32,510
Why? Where are you going?

230
00:25:32,687 --> 00:25:35,418
Oh, just like
a school barbecue thing.

231
00:25:35,633 --> 00:25:37,402
Oh, so you're not eating
with us?

232
00:25:37,565 --> 00:25:39,285
No, I was still gonna
eat here.

233
00:25:39,409 --> 00:25:40,825
Well, you can eat there
if you want. I just didn't...

234
00:25:40,827 --> 00:25:43,446
No, no, no. I'm gonna
eat here. I just, I...

235
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:46,201
Just be going to hang out.

236
00:25:48,784 --> 00:25:49,984
No drinking?

237
00:25:51,506 --> 00:25:54,541
We're not even old enough
to get drinks if we wanted to.

238
00:25:54,848 --> 00:25:57,714
Well, that's a crock. I'm just
asking if you're drinking.

239
00:25:58,127 --> 00:25:59,760
Well, I just answered no.

240
00:26:01,503 --> 00:26:03,180
You gonna take your sister?

241
00:26:04,681 --> 00:26:07,537
Uh... Does she want to go?

242
00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:10,836
Have you asked her?

243
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:15,686
Charlie?

244
00:26:46,065 --> 00:26:47,144
Charlie!

245
00:26:49,258 --> 00:26:53,464
I mean, what are you doing?
Leaving the house barefoot?

246
00:26:53,662 --> 00:26:54,685
Are you some kind of idiot?

247
00:26:54,687 --> 00:26:57,391
You can't roam around
with no shoes and no coat.

248
00:26:57,561 --> 00:26:59,325
- I want Grandma.
- Oh.

249
00:26:59,932 --> 00:27:02,456
Oh, what?
You're angry with me now?

250
00:27:05,862 --> 00:27:08,298
You are going to this...
Hey, socks off.

251
00:27:08,438 --> 00:27:10,239
You're going to this party
with your brother.

252
00:27:10,902 --> 00:27:11,838
What party?

253
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,548
Some school hangout
with other kids.

254
00:27:16,162 --> 00:27:16,880
That's okay.

255
00:27:16,882 --> 00:27:20,000
No, it's not okay.
You're going.

256
00:27:20,124 --> 00:27:21,595
- Why?
- Because it'll be fun.

257
00:27:21,651 --> 00:27:23,581
Because you'll get to hang out
with other kids.

258
00:27:23,644 --> 00:27:24,855
- With who?
- With your...

259
00:27:24,907 --> 00:27:26,606
With your brother.
With other kids.

260
00:27:31,938 --> 00:27:33,521
- Fine.
- Good. You're going.

261
00:27:33,553 --> 00:27:35,554
- She's going with you.
- Great.

262
00:27:35,608 --> 00:27:37,448
Now this really means
no drinking.

263
00:27:37,517 --> 00:27:39,284
Yeah, I really wasn't
going to.

264
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,037
<i>Whoa. Hi.</i>

265
00:29:18,463 --> 00:29:19,763
Oh. Hi.

266
00:29:20,423 --> 00:29:21,756
How's the party?

267
00:29:22,956 --> 00:29:25,117
Why? You wanna know
if you should come?

268
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:27,526
Uh, yeah. What do ya think?

269
00:29:29,988 --> 00:29:31,322
Either way.

270
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:36,339
Hey, do you happen
to smoke at all?

271
00:29:36,379 --> 00:29:38,012
I have really good weed.

272
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,687
- The other room has a bong.
- Sick.

273
00:29:52,221 --> 00:29:53,717
Do you wanna wait out here
for a second?

274
00:29:53,782 --> 00:29:55,821
- No.
- Charlie, please, just...

275
00:29:55,886 --> 00:29:57,704
It'll be two minutes
and then we can hang out.

276
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:00,715
You can draw.
Please, Charlie. I'm...

277
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,456
Oh, shit, look. They're
giving out chocolate cake.

278
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:05,713
Not to everyone.

279
00:30:05,715 --> 00:30:07,053
Yes to everyone. It's a party.

280
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,093
- I don't know anyone.
- Nobody does.

281
00:30:09,148 --> 00:30:11,899
Just walk over and stand there
and they'll give you a piece.

282
00:30:11,956 --> 00:30:13,723
Hurry up. They're gonna
run out. Come on, Charlie.

283
00:30:19,593 --> 00:30:22,994
Hey, guys. Peter has weed.

284
00:30:46,866 --> 00:30:48,503
That was
your sister downstairs?

285
00:30:48,815 --> 00:30:50,840
Yeah. Charlie.

286
00:30:52,761 --> 00:30:54,028
Is your sister hot?

287
00:30:56,828 --> 00:30:58,816
I actually saw her
drawing me last week.

288
00:30:59,021 --> 00:30:59,947
Oh, yeah?

289
00:31:00,015 --> 00:31:02,738
Yeah. She made me
look retarded.

290
00:31:03,043 --> 00:31:04,408
Yeah. That's Charlie.

291
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:35,158
Peter?

292
00:31:35,347 --> 00:31:38,214
Charlie.

293
00:31:38,567 --> 00:31:40,834
What's up?

294
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,531
Are you okay?

295
00:31:48,128 --> 00:31:49,996
It's hard to breathe.

296
00:31:51,656 --> 00:31:52,722
What do you mean?

297
00:31:53,915 --> 00:31:56,041
I think my throat's
getting bigger.

298
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:47,487
It's okay, Charlie. We're
almost at the hospital, okay?

299
00:33:05,542 --> 00:33:07,542
Charlie!

300
00:34:27,377 --> 00:34:28,698
You okay.

301
00:34:31,824 --> 00:34:32,957
Okay.

302
00:35:41,131 --> 00:35:43,195
Okay, good.
They're home.

303
00:35:43,857 --> 00:35:44,923
Good.

304
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:44,033
I'm running out
for some balsam wood.

305
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,260
You want anything?

306
00:36:45,305 --> 00:36:47,759
I'm good, sweetheart.
Drive safe.

307
00:36:47,814 --> 00:36:50,437
Okay. Back in 20.

308
00:37:27,965 --> 00:37:31,418
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

309
00:37:36,042 --> 00:37:40,224
Oh, no. I can't, I can't...

310
00:37:40,353 --> 00:37:45,762
I just want to die!

311
00:37:51,821 --> 00:37:54,527
Oh, God. It hurts too much!

312
00:37:54,529 --> 00:37:56,665
I just need to die!

313
00:38:01,249 --> 00:38:04,608
Charlie!

314
00:38:08,683 --> 00:38:12,542
Oh, God.

315
00:38:18,609 --> 00:38:21,817
Oh, Charlie!

316
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,800
Hey, are you guys friends
with Becky on Facebook?

317
00:41:57,401 --> 00:41:59,101
You're friends with Becky?

318
00:41:59,688 --> 00:42:02,223
I said "Facebook friends."

319
00:42:03,143 --> 00:42:04,938
But seriously,
you see her statuses, bro?

320
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,725
Oh, my God,
dude, I know.

321
00:42:06,772 --> 00:42:09,256
- Like, every ten seconds.
- For real.

322
00:42:09,302 --> 00:42:13,053
Oh, dude, what about, uh,
fucking... Let me hit that.

323
00:42:13,116 --> 00:42:15,184
- Brian?
- Brian and his girlfriend.

324
00:42:15,257 --> 00:42:16,492
He calls her something...

325
00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:18,618
He calls her something really
goofy, dude. What does he...

326
00:42:18,681 --> 00:42:19,778
Oh, he calls her princess.

327
00:42:22,474 --> 00:42:24,565
Who fucking calls
their girlfriend "princess"?

328
00:42:24,614 --> 00:42:26,278
What the fuck?

329
00:42:26,332 --> 00:42:27,113
Dude, he's like,

330
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:29,842
"I'm picking up
my princess from the airport.

331
00:42:29,897 --> 00:42:32,098
Fucking eating cous...
What the fuck.

332
00:42:32,161 --> 00:42:32,928
It's couscous.

333
00:42:32,976 --> 00:42:36,110
Couscous. I don't give a shit,
"...with my princess."

334
00:42:36,165 --> 00:42:37,444
You hit that shit?

335
00:42:37,494 --> 00:42:38,600
Who's his girlfriend?

336
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:42,118
Some, uh, some fucking
stupid college chick.

337
00:42:43,375 --> 00:42:44,328
Oh, damn.

338
00:42:44,413 --> 00:42:46,794
I wanna fucking stupid
college princess, bro.

339
00:42:46,865 --> 00:42:48,572
Yeah.

340
00:42:48,636 --> 00:42:50,372
Oh, hey dude.
Dude, dude, dude.

341
00:42:50,432 --> 00:42:51,565
Are you... Are you all right?

342
00:42:54,326 --> 00:42:56,992
I think I'm having a...
Like a reaction.

343
00:42:57,574 --> 00:42:58,574
My throat is...

344
00:42:58,656 --> 00:43:00,409
I think my throat
is getting bigger.

345
00:43:00,809 --> 00:43:04,077
Dude, it's just it's...
It's just weed.

346
00:43:04,262 --> 00:43:05,981
Chill, man. It's all right.

347
00:43:06,154 --> 00:43:07,934
Just hold my hand. Hold on.

348
00:44:44,656 --> 00:44:48,044
Uh, I'm so sorry
to chase you down.

349
00:44:48,091 --> 00:44:50,691
Uh, were you not
coming in, or...

350
00:44:51,372 --> 00:44:54,690
I... No, I just, um...
I forgot something.

351
00:44:54,743 --> 00:44:57,628
Oh, okay, sorry.
Sorry, I just...

352
00:44:57,673 --> 00:45:00,200
I recognized you
from a few months ago.

353
00:45:01,072 --> 00:45:04,810
Oh, God.
I feel very silly. I'm Joan.

354
00:45:06,072 --> 00:45:07,407
Hi.

355
00:45:07,463 --> 00:45:09,069
Are you doing better?

356
00:45:10,245 --> 00:45:12,778
- What?
- After your mother?

357
00:45:13,428 --> 00:45:15,896
What? No, no.
That's not...

358
00:45:18,472 --> 00:45:21,391
My, um...
My daughter was killed.

359
00:45:21,794 --> 00:45:25,188
Oh. I'm...

360
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:27,818
I'm so, so sorry.

361
00:45:28,668 --> 00:45:31,547
Oh, would you like to
come in with me?

362
00:45:31,633 --> 00:45:33,556
Or we could even
just have a coffee.

363
00:45:33,602 --> 00:45:36,302
Uh, I'm sorry.
Really, I, um...

364
00:45:36,388 --> 00:45:38,898
I can't...
I really did forget something.

365
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:40,357
My son died.

366
00:45:42,141 --> 00:45:43,607
Oh.

367
00:45:46,204 --> 00:45:47,738
I'm so sorry.

368
00:45:48,309 --> 00:45:50,009
How old was yours?

369
00:45:53,624 --> 00:45:54,756
Thirteen.

370
00:45:55,244 --> 00:45:58,118
God. That's awful.

371
00:45:59,865 --> 00:46:05,446
My son and my grandson
drowned four months ago.

372
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,582
The little one was seven.

373
00:46:07,953 --> 00:46:09,368
Oh, my God!

374
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,320
I've been coming here
for a couple of months now.

375
00:46:14,343 --> 00:46:15,961
And it has helped.

376
00:46:16,181 --> 00:46:18,683
It doesn't
make it easier obviously,

377
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:23,173
but sometimes
it makes it less lonely.

378
00:46:25,076 --> 00:46:26,661
Okay.

379
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:29,484
And now I'm about to
embarrass myself but, uh,

380
00:46:31,353 --> 00:46:35,786
if you need someone
to talk to...

381
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,142
'Cause we all do.

382
00:46:44,279 --> 00:46:45,879
If you need it.

383
00:46:48,411 --> 00:46:51,199
Okay.

384
00:46:51,379 --> 00:46:53,595
Thank you. Really.

385
00:46:56,291 --> 00:46:57,372
Okay.

386
00:47:02,132 --> 00:47:03,344
Bye-bye.

387
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:17,776
- Hey.
- Hey.

388
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:21,653
- I'm going to bed.
- Where were you?

389
00:47:21,724 --> 00:47:25,560
At the movies.
Gonna go to bed.

390
00:47:25,608 --> 00:47:27,742
Okay. I'll come up with you.

391
00:47:28,357 --> 00:47:29,470
Okay.

392
00:47:49,693 --> 00:47:51,840
I'll be right back.

393
00:47:52,928 --> 00:47:55,372
No you won't.
You're taking the blanket.

394
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:57,676
I can't sleep.

395
00:48:00,071 --> 00:48:01,638
It's freezing out there.

396
00:48:02,687 --> 00:48:04,166
Well, the heater's up there.

397
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:06,823
Okay.

398
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:09,829
Is that okay?

399
00:48:11,927 --> 00:48:13,896
If it gets too cold,
come back in.

400
00:48:18,834 --> 00:48:20,408
I just need to sleep.

401
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:50,903
Shit.

402
00:50:54,726 --> 00:50:56,761
Oh, Annie. You came.

403
00:50:56,763 --> 00:50:58,175
It's a little earlier
than we said.

404
00:50:58,177 --> 00:51:00,533
Ah, you're perfect.
Come in. Come in.

405
00:51:07,808 --> 00:51:10,235
Uh, your welcome mat.

406
00:51:10,641 --> 00:51:12,929
Ah!
It's kind of cute, huh?

407
00:51:12,931 --> 00:51:15,705
Yeah. My mother used to
embroider ones just like that.

408
00:51:15,707 --> 00:51:18,039
Did she really?
Isn't that funny?

409
00:51:18,952 --> 00:51:20,985
Please come in. Sit.

410
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,101
First there's the...

411
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:27,167
The smell of something wrong.

412
00:51:29,063 --> 00:51:33,124
And then the body.

413
00:51:34,183 --> 00:51:40,018
Covered in black blood,
like tar.

414
00:51:45,596 --> 00:51:49,113
And her head wasn't there
so I couldn't see her face.

415
00:51:49,154 --> 00:51:51,622
But they were gone.

416
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:56,770
And her hands,
and her little finger nails.

417
00:52:32,373 --> 00:52:34,674
How is your relationship
with your son?

418
00:52:36,038 --> 00:52:38,094
- Peter?
- Hmm.

419
00:52:39,277 --> 00:52:41,385
Oh, God. Um...

420
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:46,287
Okay, I sleepwalk.

421
00:52:48,768 --> 00:52:51,529
I mean, I haven't done it
in years, but, um...

422
00:52:52,244 --> 00:52:55,274
A couple years ago,
I woke up

423
00:52:55,804 --> 00:52:58,850
and I was standing
next to Peter in Charlie's bed

424
00:52:58,852 --> 00:53:01,994
when they shared a room.

425
00:53:04,218 --> 00:53:05,428
And they were

426
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:10,327
completely covered
in paint thinner.

427
00:53:11,803 --> 00:53:13,404
And so was I.

428
00:53:14,311 --> 00:53:15,846
From head to toe.

429
00:53:19,287 --> 00:53:21,962
And I was standing there
with a box of matches

430
00:53:22,024 --> 00:53:23,743
and an empty can
of paint thinner.

431
00:53:26,278 --> 00:53:28,005
And I woke myself up
striking the match,

432
00:53:28,046 --> 00:53:31,236
which also woke Peter up,
and he started to scream.

433
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:34,974
And I immediately put
the match out.

434
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,140
Like, immediately.

435
00:53:37,216 --> 00:53:39,692
I mean, I was just
as shocked as he was.

436
00:53:40,983 --> 00:53:43,856
And it was impossible
to convince them

437
00:53:43,858 --> 00:53:45,978
that it was just sleepwalking,

438
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:49,966
which of course it was, but...

439
00:53:50,681 --> 00:53:52,716
The timing was awful.

440
00:53:52,786 --> 00:53:55,592
Peter and I had gotten into
this stupid quarreling phase,

441
00:53:55,594 --> 00:53:58,661
just forever arguing
about nothing, such...

442
00:54:01,255 --> 00:54:02,755
Frivolous stuff.

443
00:54:06,074 --> 00:54:08,327
And Peter always held it
against me.

444
00:54:09,132 --> 00:54:10,705
And there was nothing
I can say

445
00:54:10,767 --> 00:54:12,801
and nothing I can do

446
00:54:13,082 --> 00:54:16,286
because it happened.

447
00:54:19,536 --> 00:54:21,335
While I was asleep.

448
00:54:25,578 --> 00:54:27,780
Hey! That was quick.

449
00:54:28,458 --> 00:54:30,224
Did you bike all the way here?

450
00:54:30,317 --> 00:54:32,582
Um, no. Actually my friend
drove me home.

451
00:54:32,668 --> 00:54:35,778
Oh, uh, by the way,
Peter, have you, um...

452
00:54:35,852 --> 00:54:38,885
Have you signed up for that,
uh, SAT prep course?

453
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:39,777
I'll do it tomorrow.

454
00:54:39,779 --> 00:54:41,314
Yeah, you know what,
you gotta do that

455
00:54:41,316 --> 00:54:42,849
because it's coming up.

456
00:55:19,007 --> 00:55:20,775
Jesus Christ, Annie.

457
00:55:22,225 --> 00:55:24,748
You're not planning on letting
him see that, are you?

458
00:55:24,818 --> 00:55:26,433
- Who?
- Peter.

459
00:55:26,503 --> 00:55:28,319
How do you think he's gonna
feel when he sees that?

460
00:55:28,321 --> 00:55:29,945
What? It's not about him.

461
00:55:29,947 --> 00:55:31,061
Oh, no?

462
00:55:31,063 --> 00:55:33,458
No. It's a neutral view
of the accident.

463
00:55:43,218 --> 00:55:45,044
Are you, uh, are you
coming down to dinner?

464
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:45,705
I'm making dinner.

465
00:55:45,707 --> 00:55:48,040
No, I made the dinner.
I came to get you.

466
00:55:48,173 --> 00:55:50,831
Come, stay, whatever you want.
I don't really give a shit.

467
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:39,688
This is really good, Dad.

468
00:56:41,031 --> 00:56:42,098
Thanks, buddy.

469
00:57:01,462 --> 00:57:02,980
You okay, Mom?

470
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:07,731
What?

471
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:11,927
Is there something
on your mind?

472
00:57:14,366 --> 00:57:16,166
Is there something
on your mind?

473
00:57:18,914 --> 00:57:23,591
It just seems like there might
be something you wanna say.

474
00:57:23,593 --> 00:57:25,007
- Peter...
- Like what?

475
00:57:25,046 --> 00:57:27,216
I mean, why would I wanna
say something

476
00:57:27,268 --> 00:57:29,153
so I can watch you
sneer at me.

477
00:57:30,499 --> 00:57:32,407
Sneer at you?
I don't ever sneer at you.

478
00:57:32,486 --> 00:57:33,555
Oh, sweetie.
You don't have to.

479
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:35,008
You get your point across.

480
00:57:35,209 --> 00:57:37,092
Okay, so fine. Then say
what you wanna say then.

481
00:57:37,156 --> 00:57:37,837
Peter.

482
00:57:37,919 --> 00:57:42,335
I don't wanna say anything.
I've tried saying things.

483
00:57:42,374 --> 00:57:43,818
Okay, so try again.
Release yourself.

484
00:57:43,842 --> 00:57:45,390
Oh, release you, you mean.

485
00:57:45,437 --> 00:57:47,511
Yeah, fine. Release me.
Just say it.

486
00:57:47,543 --> 00:57:48,893
Just fucking say it!

487
00:57:48,942 --> 00:57:51,360
Don't you swear at me,
you little shit!

488
00:57:51,415 --> 00:57:53,312
Don't you ever
raise your voice at me!

489
00:57:53,368 --> 00:57:55,194
I am your mother!

490
00:57:55,256 --> 00:57:56,694
Do you understand?

491
00:57:56,696 --> 00:58:00,736
All I do is worry and slave
and defend you.

492
00:58:00,738 --> 00:58:04,497
And all I get back is that
fucking face on your face.

493
00:58:04,567 --> 00:58:07,812
So full of disdain
and resentment

494
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:09,732
and always so annoyed.

495
00:58:09,789 --> 00:58:11,848
Well, now your sister is dead.

496
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:15,671
And I know you miss her,
and I know it was an accident

497
00:58:15,725 --> 00:58:17,033
and I know you're in pain.

498
00:58:17,069 --> 00:58:19,107
And I wish I could take that
away for you.

499
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:21,862
I wish I could shield you
from the knowledge

500
00:58:21,864 --> 00:58:25,915
that you did what you did,
but your sister is dead!

501
00:58:26,594 --> 00:58:28,394
She's gone forever!

502
00:58:30,027 --> 00:58:32,171
And what a waste.

503
00:58:32,233 --> 00:58:34,880
If it could have maybe brought
us together or something.

504
00:58:34,934 --> 00:58:36,919
If you could have just said,
"I'm sorry",

505
00:58:36,966 --> 00:58:39,026
or faced up to what happened.

506
00:58:39,088 --> 00:58:41,589
Maybe then we could do
something with this.

507
00:58:41,659 --> 00:58:44,322
But you can't take
responsibility for anything!

508
00:58:44,403 --> 00:58:47,161
So now I can't accept...

509
00:58:47,262 --> 00:58:51,368
And I can't forgive because...

510
00:58:53,911 --> 00:58:57,165
Because nobody admits
anything they've done!

511
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,199
What about you, Mom?

512
00:59:35,932 --> 00:59:37,798
She didn't wanna go
to the party.

513
00:59:39,824 --> 00:59:41,623
So why was she there?

514
00:59:43,153 --> 00:59:45,553
All right. We're
stopping this right now.

515
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,466
That's it.

516
00:59:50,626 --> 00:59:53,845
I said stop right now.

517
00:59:53,912 --> 00:59:55,146
Fine!

518
01:00:02,759 --> 01:00:03,727
Fine.

519
01:01:17,351 --> 01:01:18,584
Joan?

520
01:01:19,567 --> 01:01:22,128
Oh! Annie!

521
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:25,291
- Hey.
- Oh!

522
01:01:25,666 --> 01:01:27,521
- Annie!
- Hi!

523
01:01:28,838 --> 01:01:30,615
Oh, my!

524
01:01:30,849 --> 01:01:32,340
How are you?

525
01:01:32,411 --> 01:01:34,539
- Oh, Annie! I'm...
- Are you okay?

526
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:40,568
I'm... I am, yes.
I'm really good.

527
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:44,675
- I'm really, really...
- Okay.

528
01:01:45,542 --> 01:01:49,193
Something's...
Something happened, Annie,

529
01:01:49,263 --> 01:01:54,052
and I feel completely
turned around.

530
01:01:54,141 --> 01:01:56,412
What happened?

531
01:01:56,482 --> 01:01:58,331
I don't even know
if I should say.

532
01:01:58,333 --> 01:01:59,574
What do you mean?

533
01:01:59,576 --> 01:02:01,310
You're gonna think I am crazy!

534
01:02:01,312 --> 01:02:02,378
No, not at all.

535
01:02:02,442 --> 01:02:04,725
Oh. Okay.

536
01:02:05,686 --> 01:02:06,921
All right, come on.

537
01:02:09,315 --> 01:02:13,822
I met a spiritual medium.

538
01:02:15,215 --> 01:02:18,260
They were performing
an open séance.

539
01:02:18,262 --> 01:02:20,020
I know, I know
what you're thinking,

540
01:02:20,022 --> 01:02:21,786
but they asked me to attend.

541
01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:24,614
They were bringing skeptics
in and scientists.

542
01:02:24,653 --> 01:02:27,293
So I went, fully skeptical.

543
01:02:27,347 --> 01:02:31,783
And what I experienced there,
Annie, was truly...

544
01:02:31,982 --> 01:02:32,727
Open séance...

545
01:02:32,729 --> 01:02:38,691
They brought in the spirit of
a man from the 19th century.

546
01:02:38,761 --> 01:02:42,554
And no, no, not in a kind of
smoke and mirrors way, no.

547
01:02:42,556 --> 01:02:43,757
And the man sitting
next to me

548
01:02:43,759 --> 01:02:47,083
was a completely
cynical neurologist

549
01:02:47,085 --> 01:02:51,424
and he looked permanently
changed by the end of it.

550
01:02:51,479 --> 01:02:54,614
No, I... I... I know
what you're thinking. I do.

551
01:02:54,668 --> 01:02:58,355
But I... I approached
the medium afterwards

552
01:02:58,426 --> 01:03:01,170
and I asked her about my son
and my grandson

553
01:03:01,197 --> 01:03:04,231
and she came to my apartment
and she...

554
01:03:09,766 --> 01:03:11,912
She ended up performing...

555
01:03:12,886 --> 01:03:17,245
Well... She conjured
my grandson.

556
01:03:18,221 --> 01:03:21,089
No, no, no, I know, I know
what that smile is. I know.

557
01:03:21,091 --> 01:03:23,560
Annie, Annie...
I wouldn't believe it either,

558
01:03:23,562 --> 01:03:25,172
I didn't believe it,

559
01:03:25,514 --> 01:03:29,090
but I heard his voice.

560
01:03:29,812 --> 01:03:32,605
I felt his presence
in the room.

561
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:35,063
Annie, this is real.

562
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:38,573
What are you doing right now?

563
01:03:38,986 --> 01:03:40,636
I'm just here shopping.

564
01:03:40,638 --> 01:03:42,044
Do you wanna come over?

565
01:03:42,247 --> 01:03:45,560
Oh, Annie. Please, Annie.
I really think you should.

566
01:03:45,635 --> 01:03:48,570
It would be everything
if you came.

567
01:04:01,182 --> 01:04:02,816
Nice mood setter.

568
01:04:12,668 --> 01:04:14,067
Okay.

569
01:04:15,804 --> 01:04:18,113
I'm going to put my hand
on the glass,

570
01:04:19,447 --> 01:04:21,588
but I'm not going to
add pressure.

571
01:04:22,465 --> 01:04:24,065
You do the same.

572
01:04:32,838 --> 01:04:34,337
All right.

573
01:04:39,586 --> 01:04:40,980
Louis...

574
01:04:43,468 --> 01:04:46,503
Louis, are you here?
It's Grandma.

575
01:04:57,264 --> 01:05:01,403
Louis, if you are here
with us,

576
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:06,067
please just try
and slide the glass.

577
01:05:10,481 --> 01:05:14,351
Louis, if you're here...

578
01:05:17,277 --> 01:05:18,577
Hi, Louis!

579
01:05:18,634 --> 01:05:22,138
- Hi, Louis!
- How did you do that?

580
01:05:23,053 --> 01:05:27,443
Louis, I'm going to ask you
some questions. Okay, sweetie?

581
01:05:27,864 --> 01:05:32,191
If the answer is yes,
slide the glass to the right.

582
01:05:32,582 --> 01:05:34,181
If it's no,

583
01:05:34,323 --> 01:05:37,471
slide it the other way,
to the left.

584
01:05:37,602 --> 01:05:39,276
Do you understand?

585
01:05:42,617 --> 01:05:45,887
Louis, are you okay?

586
01:05:48,831 --> 01:05:50,432
Are you in pain?

587
01:05:51,684 --> 01:05:54,925
- Oh, my God!
- It's okay. It's okay.

588
01:05:55,279 --> 01:05:57,157
It's okay. It's okay.

589
01:05:57,220 --> 01:06:00,321
Louis, I brought
your chalkboard.

590
01:06:00,612 --> 01:06:03,312
Remember your chalkboard?

591
01:06:04,284 --> 01:06:06,251
Can you write something?

592
01:06:34,857 --> 01:06:38,761
Oh, Louis!
I love you, sweetheart!

593
01:06:39,108 --> 01:06:41,209
I'm sorry.
Could we stop?

594
01:06:41,858 --> 01:06:42,653
What?

595
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,804
- I'm sorry.
- Please...

596
01:06:44,906 --> 01:06:47,335
Louis, we're going to stop
for a second,

597
01:06:47,397 --> 01:06:49,263
but I'll be right back.

598
01:06:53,044 --> 01:06:53,769
Are you all right?

599
01:06:53,771 --> 01:06:55,264
I'm sorry, I'm just...
I really...

600
01:06:55,266 --> 01:06:56,835
I understand, I understand.

601
01:06:56,837 --> 01:06:58,863
That's exactly how I reacted
the first time.

602
01:06:58,865 --> 01:07:00,360
I have to go. Okay.
I'm... I'm sorry. Thank you.

603
01:07:00,362 --> 01:07:03,129
- No, no. It's okay. It's okay.
- Thank you. Yeah.

604
01:07:10,767 --> 01:07:13,464
I know. I know, honey.

605
01:07:13,541 --> 01:07:15,513
If you want to try this
on your own...

606
01:07:15,571 --> 01:07:18,138
- God...
- It's okay. It's okay.

607
01:07:18,187 --> 01:07:20,271
First light the candle,

608
01:07:20,342 --> 01:07:23,096
then choose an item that
belonged to your daughter.

609
01:07:23,152 --> 01:07:25,952
That will be your link.
Mine was the chalkboard.

610
01:07:26,007 --> 01:07:27,373
That's my link.

611
01:07:27,555 --> 01:07:29,622
It's all right.
It's all right.

612
01:07:29,742 --> 01:07:32,388
It's okay. There you go.

613
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:33,924
Then when you're ready,

614
01:07:34,281 --> 01:07:36,250
read this out loud,

615
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:39,180
every syllable,
very carefully.

616
01:07:39,456 --> 01:07:41,806
Sorry, why?
What is it?

617
01:07:41,853 --> 01:07:43,332
I don't know
what language it is.

618
01:07:43,334 --> 01:07:45,519
The medium
had me read it first.

619
01:07:45,593 --> 01:07:47,559
It's to make things start.

620
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:50,160
But remember,
your whole family...

621
01:07:50,185 --> 01:07:52,894
Every member needs to be
in the house.

622
01:07:52,965 --> 01:07:55,716
Your son, everyone.
Very important.

623
01:07:55,718 --> 01:07:57,439
- Okay.
- Okay?

624
01:07:57,824 --> 01:07:59,993
Deep breath.

625
01:08:00,027 --> 01:08:01,780
You didn't kill her, Annie.

626
01:08:07,271 --> 01:08:08,210
What?

627
01:08:08,893 --> 01:08:10,827
She isn't gone.

628
01:10:56,828 --> 01:10:59,562
Mom?
What are you doing?

629
01:11:04,650 --> 01:11:06,166
What's going on?

630
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:08,986
You're sleepwalking.

631
01:11:15,778 --> 01:11:19,611
I'm sorry. Is Charlie here?

632
01:11:22,343 --> 01:11:24,338
Why are you scared of me?

633
01:11:28,401 --> 01:11:29,524
What?

634
01:11:33,457 --> 01:11:35,423
I never wanted
to be your mother.

635
01:11:40,281 --> 01:11:41,387
Why?

636
01:11:41,968 --> 01:11:43,635
I was scared.

637
01:11:45,543 --> 01:11:48,709
I didn't feel like a mother.

638
01:11:49,483 --> 01:11:51,197
But she pressured me.

639
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:53,445
Then why did you have me?

640
01:11:53,494 --> 01:11:56,365
It wasn't my fault.
I tried to stop it.

641
01:11:58,481 --> 01:11:59,714
How?

642
01:12:02,227 --> 01:12:04,250
I tried to have a miscarriage.

643
01:12:07,183 --> 01:12:08,368
How?

644
01:12:09,535 --> 01:12:10,589
However I could.

645
01:12:10,591 --> 01:12:13,696
I did everything they told me
not to do but it didn't work.

646
01:12:14,215 --> 01:12:16,131
I'm happy it didn't work.

647
01:12:16,537 --> 01:12:18,382
You tried to kill me.

648
01:12:18,439 --> 01:12:20,234
No, I did not. I love you!

649
01:12:20,236 --> 01:12:21,443
You tried to kill me!

650
01:12:21,492 --> 01:12:23,294
- I love you!
- Why did you try to kill me?

651
01:12:23,364 --> 01:12:24,865
I didn't!
I was trying to save you!

652
01:12:24,921 --> 01:12:26,965
Why did you try to kill me?

653
01:12:53,719 --> 01:12:54,896
Peter?

654
01:12:56,972 --> 01:12:58,534
Peter, sweetheart? Wake up.

655
01:12:58,536 --> 01:13:00,760
- What?
- It's okay. It's me.

656
01:13:00,807 --> 01:13:03,251
I am so, so sorry
for everything.

657
01:13:03,307 --> 01:13:04,711
- Please, please forgive me.
- It's okay.

658
01:13:04,738 --> 01:13:05,931
I can't stand
the things I said.

659
01:13:05,933 --> 01:13:07,400
It's okay. It's okay.

660
01:13:09,007 --> 01:13:11,356
Can you get up, sweetheart?
We're gonna try something.

661
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:12,869
I was having a nightmare.

662
01:13:12,908 --> 01:13:14,368
Oh, it's okay.
We can do something.

663
01:13:14,415 --> 01:13:15,232
Do what?

664
01:13:15,234 --> 01:13:17,269
I figured it out.
Come on, come on.

665
01:13:19,528 --> 01:13:22,737
Steven. Baby. Steve, wake up.

666
01:13:23,918 --> 01:13:25,243
- What?
- Come downstairs.

667
01:13:25,307 --> 01:13:26,511
We're gonna try
something together.

668
01:13:26,566 --> 01:13:28,714
Come on, come on.

669
01:13:31,178 --> 01:13:32,664
Steve, come on. Let's go.

670
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:49,029
- Dad?
- It's okay.

671
01:13:57,003 --> 01:13:58,430
Come on, come on!

672
01:14:04,902 --> 01:14:07,566
Okay. So...

673
01:14:07,689 --> 01:14:09,684
It's freezing in here.

674
01:14:09,713 --> 01:14:11,356
Wait! No, no, no.
What are you doing? Wait!

675
01:14:11,436 --> 01:14:12,412
I'm gonna close the window.

676
01:14:12,414 --> 01:14:13,859
No, no.
We can't change anything.

677
01:14:13,861 --> 01:14:15,359
I don't wanna mess it up.

678
01:14:15,523 --> 01:14:17,770
Everyone needs to sit.
Come sit.

679
01:14:18,601 --> 01:14:20,121
My friend Joan taught me
how to do this.

680
01:14:20,177 --> 01:14:22,811
What friend Joan?

681
01:14:23,054 --> 01:14:24,375
We need our palms on the table

682
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:26,062
and our fingers to touch.
Please.

683
01:14:26,064 --> 01:14:27,503
What are we doing here, Annie?

684
01:14:27,548 --> 01:14:28,982
Please. You'll see.

685
01:14:30,957 --> 01:14:34,115
Please. Trust me.

686
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:38,963
All right, fine.

687
01:14:42,729 --> 01:14:44,796
We can do it over here then.

688
01:14:45,423 --> 01:14:47,724
Peter. Okay.

689
01:14:48,933 --> 01:14:51,364
Okay, Steve. Come on.

690
01:14:52,292 --> 01:14:54,136
I need you both
to concentrate.

691
01:14:54,138 --> 01:14:55,028
On what?

692
01:14:55,030 --> 01:14:56,014
Think about Charlie,
if you can.

693
01:14:56,016 --> 01:14:58,447
- Oh, for fuck's sake.
- Sweetheart, please, please.

694
01:14:58,449 --> 01:14:59,517
I tried this 20 minutes ago

695
01:14:59,519 --> 01:15:00,919
- and it worked.
- What worked?

696
01:15:00,921 --> 01:15:01,896
I would not be bringing you
down here if it didn't.

697
01:15:01,898 --> 01:15:02,756
Well, I just need to show you.

698
01:15:02,758 --> 01:15:06,437
- Show what?
- Fuck! I'm a...

699
01:15:06,868 --> 01:15:08,039
I'm a medium, okay?

700
01:15:08,041 --> 01:15:09,419
I was
seeing apparitions earlier

701
01:15:09,421 --> 01:15:11,657
and I just shook them off
and I shouldn't have.

702
01:15:11,945 --> 01:15:13,007
Please, I know how it sounds,

703
01:15:13,056 --> 01:15:14,063
but there's no way
to talk about it.

704
01:15:14,101 --> 01:15:16,290
I just need to show you, okay?
Please, you'll see.

705
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:18,199
- I'm completely lucid.
- Peter, go to bed.

706
01:15:18,253 --> 01:15:19,978
What! No, no, no!
Peter, please!

707
01:15:20,017 --> 01:15:20,978
We need to do this
as a family.

708
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:23,776
This needs all our energies,
okay? Together.

709
01:15:23,812 --> 01:15:26,247
All right, I'll stay.

710
01:15:26,485 --> 01:15:28,078
Steve. Steve, please.

711
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,407
I really, really need you
to be open to this.

712
01:15:30,409 --> 01:15:33,471
Please, please.
I promise... Both of you.

713
01:15:33,539 --> 01:15:36,426
Please. I need you
to be open. Please.

714
01:15:36,637 --> 01:15:40,281
Come on, Steve.
Come on, come on. I promise.

715
01:15:40,283 --> 01:15:43,374
Okay.

716
01:15:43,926 --> 01:15:45,516
Okay, good.

717
01:15:45,851 --> 01:15:47,887
So, I read that earlier.

718
01:15:47,889 --> 01:15:49,722
I don't think
I need to read that again.

719
01:15:50,387 --> 01:15:52,388
What language is even that?

720
01:15:52,787 --> 01:15:55,234
Try to concentrate.

721
01:16:02,055 --> 01:16:03,177
Charlie?

722
01:16:04,712 --> 01:16:06,319
Charlie, are you here?

723
01:16:14,427 --> 01:16:15,960
Charlie, it's Mommy.

724
01:16:17,014 --> 01:16:18,567
And Daddy and Peter.

725
01:16:25,784 --> 01:16:28,319
Charlie, if you're
in this room with us,

726
01:16:28,531 --> 01:16:30,430
I'm gonna have us all
touch the glass.

727
01:16:30,432 --> 01:16:31,865
Don't add pressure.

728
01:16:33,013 --> 01:16:34,546
Now if you're in here,
Charlie,

729
01:16:34,632 --> 01:16:36,919
I want you to move
the glass for us.

730
01:16:36,988 --> 01:16:38,171
Even if it's just a tiny bit.

731
01:16:38,173 --> 01:16:39,277
- Oh, Jesus Christ, Annie!
- Even if it's just the tiniest

732
01:16:39,279 --> 01:16:40,913
little movement.
Okay, Charlie?

733
01:16:43,217 --> 01:16:44,274
Okay.

734
01:16:45,353 --> 01:16:49,212
Shit. What the hell?

735
01:16:50,085 --> 01:16:52,052
- What?
- You don't feel that?

736
01:16:52,606 --> 01:16:53,545
What? Feel what?

737
01:16:53,547 --> 01:16:57,436
Like, you don't feel
the air flexing?

738
01:17:00,872 --> 01:17:02,936
Wow! Yes!

739
01:17:02,938 --> 01:17:05,306
Thank you, Charlie!
That was so good!

740
01:17:05,570 --> 01:17:08,876
Okay. Now, Charlie,
what I'd like for you to do

741
01:17:08,922 --> 01:17:11,841
is I'd like for you to show
them what you did earlier.

742
01:17:16,212 --> 01:17:17,732
Can you show them what
you just did for me before?

743
01:17:17,753 --> 01:17:19,854
- Mom.
- She's gonna do it.

744
01:17:24,566 --> 01:17:26,650
- That's enough!
- What! No, no, no!

745
01:17:26,652 --> 01:17:28,980
Listen,
when I did this earlier,

746
01:17:29,359 --> 01:17:32,065
this manifested on the page.
I saw it!

747
01:17:32,067 --> 01:17:33,514
- I saw it!
- What is it?

748
01:17:33,516 --> 01:17:34,966
- It's Charlie!
- Annie!

749
01:17:34,968 --> 01:17:36,093
Charlie, did you want to draw
some more?

750
01:17:36,150 --> 01:17:38,194
- You can keep going.
- Stop it! Stop it!

751
01:17:38,225 --> 01:17:40,440
Okay, we need to keep
our fingers touching...

752
01:17:40,442 --> 01:17:42,161
You are scaring him!

753
01:17:42,163 --> 01:17:44,657
No, I am not!
Peter, Peter, listen...

754
01:17:44,659 --> 01:17:45,779
Stop it!

755
01:17:45,781 --> 01:17:48,266
Listen to me.
There is no need to be scared.

756
01:17:48,268 --> 01:17:49,438
This is your sister.

757
01:17:50,718 --> 01:17:51,597
Mom.

758
01:17:54,615 --> 01:17:57,305
Charlie, what's wrong?

759
01:18:37,590 --> 01:18:38,519
Hello?

760
01:18:39,558 --> 01:18:42,950
- Mom?
- Mom? Mom?

761
01:18:42,952 --> 01:18:44,034
I don't like this.

762
01:18:44,036 --> 01:18:45,661
- Dad, I don't like this.
- What's happening?

763
01:18:45,663 --> 01:18:47,034
- Please stop.
- Annie, please, stop this.

764
01:18:47,036 --> 01:18:48,092
- What's going on?
- Please stop this.

765
01:18:48,094 --> 01:18:49,501
- Please.
- Mom!

766
01:18:49,503 --> 01:18:51,055
You're really freaking me out.
Please stop.

767
01:18:51,057 --> 01:18:52,225
What's happening?
Why is everyone scared?

768
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:53,467
Dad, make it stop.

769
01:18:54,021 --> 01:18:55,370
Why
are you scaring me!

770
01:18:55,419 --> 01:18:57,622
Make it stop! Make it stop!
Make it fucking stop!

771
01:18:57,669 --> 01:18:59,708
- Make it stop!
- Where's Mom!

772
01:18:59,771 --> 01:19:02,750
Stop it!
Stop it now! Please stop!

773
01:19:02,793 --> 01:19:04,794
Mom? Peter?
Peter, I'm scared.

774
01:19:04,843 --> 01:19:06,804
Dad, make it stop!

775
01:19:06,892 --> 01:19:10,651
What the hell?
What are you doing?

776
01:19:19,508 --> 01:19:20,975
What happened?

777
01:20:05,263 --> 01:20:07,767
Our country has had
many ups and downs

778
01:20:07,769 --> 01:20:09,081
economically speaking.

779
01:20:09,083 --> 01:20:10,548
We've talked
about the struggles

780
01:20:10,586 --> 01:20:15,436
during the 1800s
compared to the fall of 1929,

781
01:20:15,698 --> 01:20:18,293
in an era that
become known appropriately

782
01:20:18,348 --> 01:20:19,995
as the Great Depression.

783
01:20:19,997 --> 01:20:24,048
For a decade we suffered
through many, many hardships.

784
01:20:24,096 --> 01:20:28,965
In 1929, Wall Street had been
going so well

785
01:20:29,068 --> 01:20:32,986
that when it finally crashed
because of the Great Boom,

786
01:20:33,049 --> 01:20:37,615
it caused a huge decline
in the economy.

787
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:41,348
So much so
that it caused food lines.

788
01:20:44,188 --> 01:20:47,494
This is where
the Federal Government has,

789
01:20:47,496 --> 01:20:48,892
or still has...

790
01:20:59,562 --> 01:21:01,803
Uh, uh. Yes, Peter?

791
01:21:01,805 --> 01:21:04,335
Um, I'm sorry.
I have to go to the bathroom.

792
01:21:04,412 --> 01:21:06,982
Um, of course. Take the pass.

793
01:21:10,544 --> 01:21:11,866
As I was saying...

794
01:21:17,498 --> 01:21:18,246
Hello?

795
01:21:18,751 --> 01:21:20,445
<i>Can you guess
who just called me from school</i>

796
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:22,483
<i>in complete hysterics?</i>

797
01:21:23,449 --> 01:21:25,982
- Charlie?
- <i>What?</i>

798
01:21:27,392 --> 01:21:29,644
Uh, nothing. What happened?

799
01:21:29,646 --> 01:21:31,141
<i>Peter just called me, Annie,</i>

800
01:21:31,143 --> 01:21:33,250
<i>terrified,
crying in the halls,</i>

801
01:21:33,252 --> 01:21:34,355
<i>convinced
he's being threatened</i>

802
01:21:34,357 --> 01:21:36,817
<i>by some vengeful spirit.</i>

803
01:21:36,872 --> 01:21:38,893
Why does he think
he's being threatened?

804
01:21:38,931 --> 01:21:41,935
<i>Listen to me, Annie.
I have a son to protect.</i>

805
01:21:42,412 --> 01:21:43,113
What does that mean?

806
01:21:43,115 --> 01:21:45,416
<i>It means that that's what
I'm worried about right now</i>

807
01:21:45,454 --> 01:21:46,332
<i>and that's how...</i>

808
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:47,766
Hey, don't talk to me
like this.

809
01:21:47,801 --> 01:21:49,321
He's my son too...

810
01:21:49,656 --> 01:21:50,452
Oh!

811
01:22:01,301 --> 01:22:03,861
Do not hang up on me again.

812
01:22:03,863 --> 01:22:07,192
I am not sleepwalking anymore.
Do you understand?

813
01:22:32,330 --> 01:22:33,350
<i>At the tone,</i>

814
01:22:33,352 --> 01:22:35,483
<i>please record
your voice message.</i>

815
01:22:35,485 --> 01:22:36,954
<i>When you are
finished recording,</i>

816
01:22:36,956 --> 01:22:40,003
<i>you may hang up or press pound
for more options.</i>

817
01:22:40,005 --> 01:22:41,854
<i>Annie, hi!</i>

818
01:22:41,856 --> 01:22:44,103
<i>This is Patrick
at the Archer Gallery.</i>

819
01:22:44,105 --> 01:22:47,554
<i>Um, I was just calling
first to see how you're doing,</i>

820
01:22:47,556 --> 01:22:49,234
<i>how your family's doing.</i>

821
01:22:49,236 --> 01:22:50,526
<i>We've all been thinking
about you</i>

822
01:22:50,528 --> 01:22:52,783
<i>and just worrying about you</i>

823
01:22:52,785 --> 01:22:54,878
<i>and hoping you're okay.</i>

824
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:57,442
<i>You guys have been in our
constant thoughts and prayers.</i>

825
01:22:57,444 --> 01:23:02,730
<i>And then also, uh, we just
wanted to, well, to say first,</i>

826
01:23:02,732 --> 01:23:05,482
<i>if you need us to postpone
the show or push the date,</i>

827
01:23:05,513 --> 01:23:07,368
<i>it's obviously more than okay.</i>

828
01:23:07,602 --> 01:23:11,529
<i>And if not, uh,
we just wanna call and see</i>

829
01:23:11,573 --> 01:23:14,834
<i>if we could help
in any way or offer...</i>

830
01:23:26,881 --> 01:23:29,492
Oh, jeez. That smell.

831
01:23:38,976 --> 01:23:41,102
Annie?
What's that smell?

832
01:24:06,549 --> 01:24:08,090
What the fuck happened here?

833
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:11,408
I didn't feel like
looking at it anymore.

834
01:26:59,922 --> 01:27:01,089
Charlie?

835
01:27:41,178 --> 01:27:43,730
Peter?
Oh my God, Peter!

836
01:27:44,822 --> 01:27:46,242
What's wrong, baby?
What's happening?

837
01:27:46,244 --> 01:27:47,288
What are you doing?

838
01:27:47,290 --> 01:27:48,303
What do you mean?

839
01:27:48,305 --> 01:27:49,970
You were pulling on my head!

840
01:27:49,972 --> 01:27:51,088
What? No I wasn't.
I just came in.

841
01:27:51,145 --> 01:27:53,417
You were screaming.
What happened?

842
01:27:53,487 --> 01:27:54,731
I saw Charlie in the corner

843
01:27:54,733 --> 01:27:56,707
and then you started
trying to pull my head off!

844
01:27:56,709 --> 01:27:58,669
Oh, Peter.
I would never do that to you.

845
01:27:58,671 --> 01:28:00,487
Are you crazy? Please, baby.

846
01:28:01,882 --> 01:28:03,449
What corner
did you see Charlie?

847
01:28:05,161 --> 01:28:06,514
Peter, listen to me.

848
01:28:06,578 --> 01:28:08,698
I don't know what's happening
or what you just saw,

849
01:28:08,761 --> 01:28:10,400
but I am stopping this.

850
01:28:10,462 --> 01:28:12,481
Do not tell Dad
what you just said to me.

851
01:28:12,514 --> 01:28:14,597
Do not, okay?
Because it is not true.

852
01:28:14,599 --> 01:28:15,484
Something is happening

853
01:28:15,486 --> 01:28:16,553
and I'm the only one
who could stop it.

854
01:28:16,555 --> 01:28:18,539
Do you understand?
I'm the only one

855
01:28:18,541 --> 01:28:19,862
who can fix this.

856
01:31:01,553 --> 01:31:02,663
Joan?

857
01:31:07,221 --> 01:31:09,529
Joan, please.
I need to talk to you.

858
01:31:13,126 --> 01:31:15,946
Joan, I really need
to ask you a question.

859
01:31:23,333 --> 01:31:24,534
Joan!

860
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:48,767
Peter!

861
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:55,524
Peter!

862
01:31:58,050 --> 01:32:00,003
Peter!

863
01:32:03,816 --> 01:32:06,101
I expel you!

864
01:32:09,899 --> 01:32:11,732
Zantany!

865
01:32:16,497 --> 01:32:17,929
Dagdany!

866
01:32:20,374 --> 01:32:22,181
Aparagon!

867
01:32:24,648 --> 01:32:26,422
Peter!

868
01:32:26,713 --> 01:32:29,844
Get out!

869
01:32:34,137 --> 01:32:35,622
Peter!

870
01:33:05,693 --> 01:33:06,898
Oh, God.

871
01:36:35,738 --> 01:36:38,705
...so everyone
feels justified.

872
01:36:40,347 --> 01:36:43,985
Iphigenia's murder
was commanded by the gods.

873
01:37:14,677 --> 01:37:17,247
So, really,
Agamemnon had no choice...

874
01:37:45,939 --> 01:37:47,272
Peter.

875
01:37:49,229 --> 01:37:50,995
Peter, what's wrong?

876
01:37:53,479 --> 01:37:55,578
Peter, are you all right?

877
01:38:01,081 --> 01:38:03,555
Can he breathe?

878
01:38:03,678 --> 01:38:05,129
Peter,
what are you doing, man?

879
01:38:46,792 --> 01:38:49,356
<i>Call from West High School.</i>

880
01:39:09,542 --> 01:39:10,775
Hello.

881
01:39:11,904 --> 01:39:13,067
Yes, it is.

882
01:39:51,312 --> 01:39:53,028
Oh, thank God.

883
01:39:55,224 --> 01:39:57,729
Wait, what? Oh my God!

884
01:39:57,784 --> 01:40:00,450
What happened?
What happened to him?

885
01:40:00,512 --> 01:40:02,580
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

886
01:40:02,613 --> 01:40:06,305
Oh my God. Oh, no.
Oh, who did that?

887
01:40:06,371 --> 01:40:08,783
He did it, apparently,
to himself.

888
01:40:10,436 --> 01:40:12,006
Smashed his face
into his own desk.

889
01:40:12,008 --> 01:40:14,663
Okay, Steve. Wait, wait.
Wait, Steve. Listen.

890
01:40:14,665 --> 01:40:17,241
Take his feet.
Please, take his feet.

891
01:40:22,787 --> 01:40:25,945
Steve, uh, upstairs...

892
01:40:26,007 --> 01:40:30,118
In the attic when you were
gone, I went up there and I...

893
01:40:30,165 --> 01:40:31,121
I just... I really need you

894
01:40:31,123 --> 01:40:32,956
to go up there
and see what I saw.

895
01:40:34,043 --> 01:40:35,616
There's a body.

896
01:40:36,637 --> 01:40:37,925
Yeah. I mean,
I think it's my mother,

897
01:40:37,927 --> 01:40:39,762
I think, but I can't tell
because the skin's all black

898
01:40:39,764 --> 01:40:42,297
and she's all distended
but the head is gone.

899
01:40:43,724 --> 01:40:46,691
Will you, please? I just need
you to go and see upstairs.

900
01:40:48,447 --> 01:40:51,095
Please, Steve.

901
01:41:02,710 --> 01:41:04,144
And then there's more.

902
01:41:04,795 --> 01:41:07,555
You mean more than your
mother's headless body?

903
01:41:07,644 --> 01:41:09,078
Of course there is.

904
01:41:56,802 --> 01:41:59,029
- Jesus, fuck!
- Okay, there's more.

905
01:41:59,031 --> 01:42:00,769
What the fuck was that?

906
01:42:00,771 --> 01:42:02,113
Why didn't you
call the police?

907
01:42:02,115 --> 01:42:03,756
The police can't help us.

908
01:42:04,342 --> 01:42:05,179
Who the fuck is that up there?

909
01:42:05,181 --> 01:42:07,412
Do you remember Joan,
my friend whose grandson died?

910
01:42:07,414 --> 01:42:09,923
- She took me to her apartment.
- It did look like your mother.

911
01:42:09,982 --> 01:42:11,616
Well, listen. She taught me
how to do the séance.

912
01:42:11,618 --> 01:42:14,107
I didn't even want to, but she
brought her grandson back

913
01:42:14,109 --> 01:42:16,350
and I saw it and felt it just
like you did with Charlie.

914
01:42:16,352 --> 01:42:18,753
Now, look.
This is my mother's album.

915
01:42:18,755 --> 01:42:20,414
Now look here. See this?

916
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:22,932
See her?
That's her. That's Joan.

917
01:42:22,934 --> 01:42:24,286
She didn't even mention
knowing my mom

918
01:42:24,288 --> 01:42:26,047
and I've never met her before,
but she approached me.

919
01:42:26,049 --> 01:42:27,335
She consoled me.

920
01:42:27,337 --> 01:42:29,541
She told me about this séance,
and she showed me how.

921
01:42:29,543 --> 01:42:30,645
Now look at this.
See this symbol?

922
01:42:30,709 --> 01:42:31,650
On the necklace
my mom gave me.

923
01:42:31,692 --> 01:42:33,529
It's her necklace, right?
They're both wearing it,

924
01:42:33,531 --> 01:42:35,677
and they're wearing it
in every photo.

925
01:42:35,679 --> 01:42:37,772
And look at that pattern!
Did you see up there?

926
01:42:37,774 --> 01:42:40,331
This was painted
above the body, right?

927
01:42:40,333 --> 01:42:41,813
In blood!

928
01:42:42,932 --> 01:42:46,868
You dug up the grave.
It was you, wasn't it?

929
01:42:46,946 --> 01:42:47,623
What?

930
01:42:47,625 --> 01:42:48,523
All those nights you were

931
01:42:48,525 --> 01:42:49,823
pretending to go
to the movies.

932
01:42:49,825 --> 01:42:50,864
You're not even listening!

933
01:42:50,866 --> 01:42:52,607
And then the day
the cemetery called, I said,

934
01:42:52,609 --> 01:42:54,817
"Oh, I won't tell her
because she'd be worried."

935
01:42:54,819 --> 01:42:57,123
Oh, God damn it!
Listen to me, Steve!

936
01:42:57,125 --> 01:42:58,640
I know you don't trust me

937
01:42:58,642 --> 01:43:00,533
and there is nothing
I can do about that.

938
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:03,802
But they put a curse on us
when we brought Charlie back.

939
01:43:03,804 --> 01:43:05,786
We made a pact with something.

940
01:43:05,788 --> 01:43:06,703
Something that is
in this house.

941
01:43:06,734 --> 01:43:08,533
I don't know what it is
but it is after Peter.

942
01:43:08,535 --> 01:43:11,445
I watched these pages fill.

943
01:43:11,447 --> 01:43:14,003
All of them are Peter!

944
01:43:14,413 --> 01:43:16,427
I'm sorry.
I don't know what I did.

945
01:43:16,429 --> 01:43:19,471
I don't know what I did
but Peter is in danger...

946
01:43:19,935 --> 01:43:21,903
And I started it.

947
01:43:22,433 --> 01:43:24,540
Now if we destroy this book,

948
01:43:25,039 --> 01:43:26,851
it will take me too.

949
01:43:27,906 --> 01:43:29,378
I tried to burn it. I tried.

950
01:43:29,380 --> 01:43:31,245
But my arm caught on fire
on its own

951
01:43:31,247 --> 01:43:32,807
as if I was linked to it
because I am linked to it.

952
01:43:32,809 --> 01:43:35,376
I understand this now. Please!

953
01:43:35,856 --> 01:43:37,857
If we don't destroy
this book...

954
01:43:40,916 --> 01:43:42,618
Peter will...

955
01:43:44,070 --> 01:43:46,816
Oh, God. Do you understand?

956
01:43:48,067 --> 01:43:52,366
We have to do this. Please,
please, please, please.

957
01:43:52,443 --> 01:43:53,910
For Peter.

958
01:44:05,162 --> 01:44:07,229
I need you to trust me, Steve.

959
01:44:08,963 --> 01:44:11,904
It needs to be me.
It's my fault.

960
01:44:11,906 --> 01:44:15,521
It's my fault.
I know it's my fault. Please.

961
01:44:15,523 --> 01:44:18,624
Please, I need you
to throw it in the fire.

962
01:44:19,825 --> 01:44:21,163
Please, I just...
I can't do it.

963
01:44:21,165 --> 01:44:23,623
I can't.
I'm just too fucking scared.

964
01:44:23,625 --> 01:44:25,498
But if we don't do it...

965
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:28,068
If we don't do it,
it's gonna be Peter,

966
01:44:28,124 --> 01:44:31,468
it's gonna be our son.
Okay, I know this. I know so.

967
01:44:31,470 --> 01:44:34,491
Just, please, please,
please, please, please...

968
01:44:39,491 --> 01:44:42,031
Steve, please.
Please understand, baby.

969
01:44:42,033 --> 01:44:46,578
Please, please.
Please throw it in the fire.

970
01:44:54,851 --> 01:44:56,898
Sweetheart, please.

971
01:44:57,165 --> 01:44:59,499
Please take it, take it.
You gotta do it.

972
01:44:59,501 --> 01:45:00,607
You gotta do it.

973
01:45:00,906 --> 01:45:02,895
Okay. Thank you, thank you.

974
01:45:02,965 --> 01:45:07,056
Okay, here. Okay.

975
01:45:07,102 --> 01:45:09,036
Now listen to me.
Listen to me.

976
01:45:16,359 --> 01:45:20,575
Oh! You are
the love of my life.

977
01:45:25,660 --> 01:45:29,277
I love you, Steve.
I love you so, so much.

978
01:45:30,135 --> 01:45:32,649
Oh, God, I love you so much.

979
01:45:32,776 --> 01:45:34,588
And I love Peter so much.

980
01:45:38,873 --> 01:45:40,325
Now please, just...

981
01:45:41,855 --> 01:45:43,655
Please just throw it in.

982
01:46:01,698 --> 01:46:03,885
I'm not gonna do this
with you anymore.

983
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:06,689
What? No, no, no!

984
01:46:06,745 --> 01:46:09,012
No, no,
it's not helpful for you.

985
01:46:09,725 --> 01:46:12,260
You are sick, Annie.

986
01:46:13,058 --> 01:46:14,778
I need to call the police.

987
01:46:15,789 --> 01:46:17,622
Oh, God!

988
01:47:24,709 --> 01:47:25,776
Mom?

989
01:47:29,571 --> 01:47:30,637
Dad?

990
01:49:07,639 --> 01:49:08,771
Mom?

991
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:10,753
Dad?

992
01:49:37,043 --> 01:49:38,443
Hello?

993
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:27,833
Mom?

994
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:09,542
Stop! Mom, please stop!

995
01:53:09,544 --> 01:53:11,794
Mom, I'm sorry!
Okay, I'm sorry.

996
01:53:16,024 --> 01:53:19,328
Mommy. Mommy, please.
I'm begging you.

997
01:53:19,344 --> 01:53:21,043
I'm begging you to stop.

998
01:53:29,242 --> 01:53:30,381
Mommy?

999
01:54:47,297 --> 01:54:49,102
Just gotta wake up.

1000
01:54:49,104 --> 01:54:51,425
You just gotta wake up.
Come on. You're okay.

1001
01:54:51,427 --> 01:54:54,604
Just wake up. Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!

1002
02:01:10,968 --> 02:01:15,282
Oh, hey, hey, hey.
It's all right.

1003
02:01:15,823 --> 02:01:17,178
Charlie...

1004
02:01:21,047 --> 02:01:22,581
You're all right now.

1005
02:01:25,452 --> 02:01:29,464
You are Paimon,

1006
02:01:30,508 --> 02:01:33,410
one of the eight kings
of Hell.

1007
02:01:36,174 --> 02:01:39,009
We have looked
to the Northwest

1008
02:01:39,011 --> 02:01:40,920
and called you in.

1009
02:01:41,818 --> 02:01:44,876
We've corrected
your first female body

1010
02:01:45,244 --> 02:01:49,777
and give you now
this healthy male host.

1011
02:01:50,480 --> 02:01:56,078
We reject the Trinity and pray
devoutly to you, great Paimon.

1012
02:01:56,499 --> 02:02:00,758
Give us your knowledge
of all secret things.

1013
02:02:01,133 --> 02:02:05,782
Bring us honor, wealth,
and good familiars.

1014
02:02:06,375 --> 02:02:09,360
Bind all men to our will,

1015
02:02:09,446 --> 02:02:15,442
as we have bound ourselves
for now and ever to yours.

1016
02:02:22,591 --> 02:02:24,325
Hail, Paimon!

1017
02:02:25,078 --> 02:02:27,538
Hail, Paimon!

1018
02:02:28,631 --> 02:02:31,134
Hail, Paimon!

1019
02:02:32,262 --> 02:02:34,461
Hail!

1020
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:41,000
