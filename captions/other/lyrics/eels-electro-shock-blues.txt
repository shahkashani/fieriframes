Laying on the bathroom floor.
Kitty licks my cheek once more.
And I, I could try.
But waking up is harder when you wanna die.

Walter's on the telephone.
Tell him I am not at home.
Cause I think that I.
Am going to a place where I am always high.

My name is Elizabeth.
My life is shit and piss.
Going to your funeral and feeling I could scream.
"Everything goes away.".
Driving down the highway through the perfect sunny dream.
A perfect day for perfect pain.

Look at all the people with the flowers in their hands.
They put the flower on the box that's holding all the sand.
That was... that was once... that was once you.

Honolulu hurricane, I knew that you were not insane.
Living in the insane world.
Smiling like it's no big deal, scabby wounds that never heal.
The woman was only a girl.

Look at all the people with their heads down in their hands.
When everything I'm feeling makes it hard to understand.
That what, what I need to miss.
It's what I need to miss... is you.

Going to your funeral and I'm feeling like a fool.
No one's gonna take the blame.
Thinking about the days of hanging out behind the school.
Everything goes away.
The kids are digging up a brand new hole.
Where they put their deadbeat mom.
Grandpa's happy watching video porn.
With the closed caption on.

And father knows best.
About suicide and smack.
Well, hee-hee-hee.

Cancer for the cure.
Cancer for the cure.
Buckle up and endure now, baby.
Cancer for the cure.

Ol' blue eyes is back again.
But he was never here in the first place.
A heart attack may be something to fear.
But take a look out back.

'Cause Courtney needs love.
And so do I.
Well, hee-hee-hee-hee.

Cancer for the cure.
Cancer for the cure, my baby.
Buckle up and endure now, sweet thing.
Cancer for the cure.

Cancer for the cure.
Cancer for the cure, my baby.
Buckle up and endure now, sweet thing.
The cancer for the.
The cancer for the.
The cancer for the.
The cancer for the cure.

(Cancer for the cure)
(Cancer for the cure)
(Cancer for the cure)
(Cancer for the cure)

(Cancer for the cure)
(Cancer for the cure)
(Cancer for the cure)
(Cancer for the cure)
(No I'm not a star. I'm a king of the roads, yeah.)

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.

Springfield's looking pretty dusty today.
I see their dreams coming undone.
The view from inside ward nine affords this much.
A town teeming with the unloved.
Close the window and lock it so it's good and tight.

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.
La-la-la-la-la.

Turning eighteen and trying not to look too lost.
Have a not-so-nice day.
The jacket makes me straight so I can just sit back and bake.
You know I think I'm gonna stay.
Talking very loud but no one hears a word I say.

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.
La-la-la-la-la.
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.
La-la-la-la-la.

Come visit me tonight at eight o'clock and then you'll see.
How I am not the crazy one.
Voices tell me I'm the shit.

Twenty days go by and every day looks the same.

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.
La-la-la-la-la.
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.
La-la-la-la-la.

I'm the shit.
Got a 3 speed and banana seat.
Sitting back on the sissy bar.
Went to Sev and got a drink.
Wish I was driving in your daddy's car.

And I looked up at the sky last night.
And I thought I saw a bomb.
And why won't you just tell me what's going on?

Riding down on Springhill Road.
Meeting Alfred out in the woods.
Dogs bark and mosquitoes bite.
Scratching the itch that makes it feel good.

And I looked into the mirror last night.
All I saw was a pretty blonde.
And why won't you just tell me what's going on?

Life is funny, but not "ha ha" funny.
Peculiar I guess.
You think I got it all going my way.
Then why am I such a fucking mess?

Want a pony and a birthday cake.
Want a party with a scary clown.
Kneel down and bow to the princess.
Kneel down for the queen of the town.

And I looked up at the sky last night.
And I thought I saw a bomb.
And why won't you just tell me what's going on?
Tell me what's going on.
Comin' through the alley tryin' to walk without a sound.
It doesn't really matter cause there ain't no one around.
Tiptoe through the alley and tiptoe through your life.
You still got it coming be it gun, be it knife.

Next thing you know.
You're eating hospital food.

Karaoke castration, take the wasp alive.
He's gonna sting you anyway and take you to the hive.
Yesterday was suckin' and tomorrow's lookin' bad.
Who knew that today was the only thing I had?

What?
What?
I can hear you.
I was, uh...

Hospital food.
Want some hospital food.
Hospital food.
Delicious hospital food.

In your tribute album to the world you must never forget.
To sing the one about the cat who's always gettin' wet.
He's always got a problem, he's a very bitter dude.
And now he's complaining 'bout his hospital food.

Hospital food.
It's gonna help the medicine go down.
Want some hospital food.
Gonna take a walk without a sound.

A little hospital food.
Helps the spoonful of sugar come up.
I want some hospital food.
In your blender and in my cup.

Hospital food.
Hospital food.
Hospital food.
Hospital food.
Feeling scared today.
Write down: "I am ok.".
A hundred times the doctors say.
I am ok.
I am ok.
I'm not ok.

Skin is crawling off.
Mopping the sweaty drops.
Sticking around for this shit.
Another day.
Another day.
Not another day.

Pink pill feels good.
Finally understood.
Take me in your warm embrace.
I am trying.
I am trying.
Efils good and the time is right.
I'll bundle-up and slip away.
The count is down and the drip is up.
It's time to split this hunk of clay.

Now you can bring back my suitcase but you can't bring me.
And you can have all the money 'cause you say that you must.
But if you think that it matters, take a look at me.
And don't close your eyes as I turn into dust.

Efils good.
Don't tell me that I can't do this.
As if you knew, but you don't know.
How Efils good.
You're dead but the world keeps spinning.
Take a spin through the world you left.
It's getting dark a little too early.
Are you missing the dearly bereft?

Taking flight and you could be here tomorrow.
Taking flight, well, you could get here tonight.
I'm gonna fly on down for the last stop to this town.
What?
I'm gonna fly on down then fly away.
Well, alright.

Get down.

Takin' a spin throught the neighbourhood.
The neighbours scream, "Whatchya talkin' bout?".
Cause they don't know how to let you in.
And I can't let you out.

What if I was not your only friend in this world.
Can you take me where you're going if you're never coming back?

I'm gonna fly on down for the last stop to this town.
I'm gonna fly on down then fly away on my way.

Get down.

Why don't we take a ride away up high through the neighbourhood.
Up over the billboards and the factories and smoke.

I'm gonna fly on down for the last stop to this town.
Yeah.
I'm gonna fly on down then fly away on my way.
Fly away.
Get down.
Baby genius.
Look how you've grown.
Where do you go from here?

Didn't we have some good times.
After all is said and done.

Small body and small mind.
Big head and big headaches.
My back is broken, baby genius.
Find a new ride.
So I wrote it all in a letter.
I don't know if it came.
The nurse, she likes my writing.
So she keeps it just like me.
So that it won't get away.

I won't be denied this time.
Before I go out of my mind.
Over matters, got my foot on the ladder.
And I'm climbing up to the moon.

Got a sky that looks like Heaven.
Got an Earth that looks like shit.
It's getting hard to tell where.
What I am ends and what they're making me begins.

And I won't be denied this time.
Before I go out of my mind.
Over matters, got my foot on the ladder.
And I'm climbing up to the moon.

Saturday in the yard.
They'll bring you by.
We'll lay down on the grass.
And watch as the sky closes in.

I won't be denied this time.
Before I go out of my mind.
Over matters, got my foot on the ladder.
And I'm climbing up to the moon.
Climbing up to the moon.
Hate a lot of things, but I love a few things.
And you are one of them.
Hard to believe after all of these years.
That you are one of them.

Walk down the street, I'm thinking.
"Everybody move along.".
I've got a sad-hearted needing.
To belong.

Nevertheless, it's all the mess you made.
But I can't let it go.

Walk down the street, I'm thinking.
"Look at all the ants in the farm.".
I've got a sad-hearted feeling.
To harm.

Hate a lot of things, but I love a few things.
And you are one of them.
Standing in the dark outside the house.
Breathing in the cold and sterile air.
Well I was thinking how it must feel.
To see that little light.
And watch it as it disappears.
And fades into.
And fades into the night.

So I know you're going pretty soon.
Radiation sore throat got your tongue.
Magic markers tattoo you.
And show it where to aim.
And strangers break their promises.
You won't feel any.
You won't feel any pain.

And the streets are jammed with cars.
Rockin' their horns.
To race to the wire.
Of the unfinished line.

Thought that I'd forget all about the past.
But it doesn't let me run too fast.
And I just wanna stand outside.
And know that this is right.
And this is true.
And I will not.
Fade into.
Fade into the night.

Standing here in the dark.
See this watch she gave me?
Well it still ticks away.
The days I'm claiming back for me.

The medication's wearing off.
Gonna hurt not a little, a lot.
Keep on tickin' you're not lickin' me.

Step on a crack break your mother's heart.
Red light, green light, black.
Suicide e-mail do not delete.
Plug it back in the jack.
Start to be what they want you to be.
And you see yourself as they see you.

Sunrise at the corner of Sunset and Alvarado.
I think, "What the hell do I do now?".
Watch the day disintegrate.
So I can stay up late and wait.

See this watch she gave me?
Well it still ticks away.
I was at a funeral the day I realized.
I wanted to spend my life with you.
Sitting down on the steps at the old post office.
The flag was flying at half-mast.

And I was thinkin' 'bout how everyone is dying.
And maybe it's time to live.

I don't know where we're going.
I don't know what we'll do.

Walked into the Thriftee.
Saw a man with the hollow eyes.
Who didn't give me all my change.
But it didn't bother me this time.
Cause I know I've only got this moment.
And it's good.

I went to the gas station.
Old woman honked her horn.
Waiting for me to fix her car.

I don't know where we're going.
I don't know what we'll do.

Laying in bed tonight I'm was thinking.
And listening to all the dogs.
And the sirens and the shots.

And how a careful man tries to dodge the bullets.
While a happy man takes a walk.

And maybe it's time to live.
