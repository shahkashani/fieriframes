First went wrong is hard to find.
We're paralyzed, we apologize.
Our hell is a good life.
Last went wrong but where's my prize, under the lights?
Can we call it in? We'll be on the road.

Can we stop?
When we stop, my back will turn your face towards the fence.

What I thought it was it isn't now.
What I thought it was it isn't now.

All this weight is honest worse.
We're moderate; we modernize.
'Til our hell is a good life.
All we know is to forget how to do right.
Colouring in the black hole.

Can we stop?
When we stop my hands will shake.
My eyes will burn, my throat will ache.
Watching you turn from me towards your friends.

What I thought it was it isn't now.
What I thought it was it isn't.
Punishment to stall what is done.
What I thought was in is missing out.
What I thought it was it isn't now.

There's a pattern in the system.
There's a bullet in the gun.
That's why I tried to save you.
But it can't be done.
It can't be done.
The lack of light, hollow sea.
Poison beaches, limousines.
Toothless dentists, cops that kill.

My Baby's got the lonesome lows.
Don't quite go away overnight.
Dr. Blind, just prescribe the blue ones.
If the dizzying highs don't subside overnight.
Dr. Blind, just prescribe the red ones.

Da da da, da da, da da, da da, da.
Da, da da, da, la da da, da da, ah.

Hard to hold, cold to touch.
Fall to pieces, treat the rush.
In hindsight with prime time talk.
All your pain will end here.
Let the doctor soothe your brain, dear.

My Baby's got the lonesome lows.
Don't quite go away overnight.
Dr. Blind, just prescribe the blue ones.
If the dizzying highs don't subside overnight.
Dr. Blind, just prescribe the red ones.

Da la da da, da da.
Da da la la da, da la da da.
Cursed with a love that you can't express.
It's not for a fuck or a kiss.
Rather give the world away than wake up lonely.
Everywhere and every way I see you with me.

Crowd surf off a cliff.
Land out on the ice.
Crowd surf off to sea.
Float toward the beach.

If you find me, hide me, I don't know where I've been.
If you find me, hide me, I don't know where I've been.

Are we breathing, are we breathing.
Are we wasting our breath?
It won't be enough to be rich.

All the babies tucked away in their beds.
We're out here screaming.
The life that you thought through is gone.
Can't wind down.
The ending outlasting the mood.
I wake up lonely.

Crowd surf off a cliff.
Land out on the ice.
Crowd surf off to sea.
Float toward the beach.

If you find me, hide me, I don't know where I've been.
When you phone me tell me everything I did.
If I'm sorry you lost me you'd better make it quick.
'Cause this call costs a fortune and it's late where you live.
It's late where you live.

Rather give the world away.
Than wake up lonely.
Everywhere and every way.
I see you with me.

All the babies tucked away in their beds.
We're out here screaming.
The life that you thought through is gone.
Can't wind down.
The ending outlasting the mood.
I wake up lonely.
I wake up lonely.
She was calling around to find half an hour.
She walked right into my mirror.
Says she's here to waste time I said "That's fine.".
Listen, to thyself be true, to thyself be true.

Every thread, every hair re-arranged to resemble.
You could have her, detective daughter copy.
Please don't be me.
There are so many skirts under the table.
None of these long legs are mine.
She calls around finds me crying.
Wish I were capable of lying sometimes.
Hide out.

Love is hell, hell is love.
Hell is asking to be loved.
Hide out and then run when no one's looking.

She's still calling around to find half an hour.
She'll always have a place in my mirror.
But she's got no more time, now she wants mine.
But I'm all out too.

To thyself be true.
To thyself be true.
To thyself be true.
To thyself be true.

Sure, it's no big deal.
I only wanted what everyone wanted since bras started burning up ribs in the sixties.
Favors are flying, faces are falling and all I desire is to never be waiting.
If that's a crime, let's commit it.
There's a new crime, sexual suicide.

When our underwire radio tears into their international airwaves.
Boredom will die, ears will bleed.
And all they'll desire is to give, and to please...

There's a new crime, sexual suicide.
There's a new crime, let's commit it.
While we're waiting on the next day.
To begin it in the best way.
There's a new crime, sexual suicide.
There's a new crime, let's commit it.

Don't worry Heather, about forever.
Don't worry about me;
It's the lottery, baby, everybody roll the dice.
It's the lottery, baby, everybody roll the dice.

Will we always be like little kids.
Running group to group, asking.
"Who loves me? Don't know who loves me.".
It's pathetic, it's impossible.
Like girls in stilettos.
Like girls in stilettos.
Like girls in stilettos trying to run.
Bros before hoes.
Disagree on the sidelines.

Fight for a fee.
The man needs a maid.
The maid needs a maid.

Bros before hoes.
Is a rule, read the guidelines.

You trouble me.
Your breasts heave when you sing.
Your mouth should be working for me.
For free.

Sewing up the fold.
'Cause I've been laid up.
Would you put on the fire for me.
Draw the bath and remind me to eat?
You won't need a real job.
You won't need a real job because I would love to pay for you.
You could be a good wife to me.

I would love to pay for you.
You are the maid for me.
Young, thought as I was.
Thought as I was.
Thought as I was.

Done, thought as I was.
Thought as I was.
Thought as I was.

Get.
Get the line down.
Get the line down.
Get the line down.
Don't elaborate like that.
You frighten off the frat boys.
Use your baby talk.
Frighten off, frighten on.

This fall the blues are brown.
So turn your horse around now.
The blues are brown.
Missing, mostly waving.
Thought as I was.
Done, thought as I was.
Young, thought as I was.
Who's in a bad mood?
Who's in a taxi?
Turning the clock back.
Avoiding a fight with this man.
He is meeting, stands in the lobby.
Counting his questions in the neon light.

Sinking under the river.
Sewer line touches the edge of the suburbs.
Back to the beach where.
A family is waiting.
On rumors of summer.
Lay out a blanket.
Bring something to feed the birds.

With all the luck you've had, why are your songs so sad?
Sing from a book you were reading in bed and took to heart.
All of your lives unled, reading in bed.
Sketch of your faces I still don't know you aren't permanent, permanent.
You want all of our moments stolen.
Blind alleys and hallways to basements.
How you gonna' hide 'till you disappear?
Because nothing and nowhere is golden.

Apartments are cages, I still don't know what is permanent, permanent.
Maybe all my possessions were precious.
Truth is all my possessions I somehow lost them.
Been traveling so light when we're floating by.
Seems nothing and nowhere is golden.

Some say we're lost in space.
Some say we're falling off the page.
Some say our life is insane.
But it isn't insane on paper.

Playgrounds are graveyards, and all of our scars are permanent, permanent.
There's no replacement for places.
I'll always love you, you're mine.
Numb is the new high, old memories die out, 'till.
Nothing and nowhere is golden.

Some say we always only want to get off.
Some say our hands are much too soft.
Some say our life is insane.
But it isn't insane on paper.

Some say our hair is in our eyes.
Some say we're out of our little minds.
Some say our life is insane.
But it isn't insane on paper to have to ask.
Hover through the foggy vapours.
Until I see you in a dream.
Singing animals to sleep...

By the way, it's over without you.
I'm in the way, I'm in the way.
I'm in the way, I'm in the way.

Lights out 'till midnight.
Sleep all day.
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Sha la la la)

Dark and quiet, only the owls are watching.
Only the sky is up and I'm leaving for a place.
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
From another time, just to be near you, just to be near you, just to be near you.
(Sha la la la la la la la la..)

I'm in the way, I'm in the way.
I'm in the way, I'm in the way, I'm in the way.
I'm in the way, I'm in the way...

Don't become the one you hated.
Death is absolutely safe.
A billion bibles mark the last page.

I've gotta' roll through the days without you here.
I get a shock, shock hurts to heal.
I've gotta' roll through the weeks without you here.
I get a shock, shock hurts to heal.
I've gotta' roll through the months without you here.
I get a shock, shock hurts to heal.
I've gotta' roll through the weeks without you here.
I get a shock, shock hurts to heal.
I've gotta' roll through the weeks without you here...
Shock hurts to heal.
Hurts to heal.
Hurts to heal.
Hurts to heal.
Hurts to heal.
Hurts to heal.
Hurts to heal.
To never open a book, always reading a magazine.
Outspend betting, if it looks like winning.
You haven't been.

Knives don't have your back.
I wait and I count.
But knives don't have your back.
I wait and I count to the last breath we take.
What we made doesn't make sense.
What's a wolf without a pack?
Open your chest and take the heart from it.
Open your chest:
What's bad? We'll fix it.
What's wrong? We'll make it all right.
All right, it's gone, we'll find it.
Takes so long, we've got time.
All the time.

Some part of you, too small to lose.
Some part of you, too small to lose.
All of us, all of you.
All of us, all of you.
Counting to the last breath we take.
What we made doesn't make sense.
What's a wolf without a pack?
Open your chest and take the heart from it.
When you talk, can I tape you?
How'd you get what we don't know?
We don't know how to help.
Only know how to hound.
Nose to the grindstone.
Grindstone to the ground.

Don't even visit that place.
They'll sharpen their teeth on your smile.
I'm glad you didn't.
All our songs will be lullabies in no time.

What's bad? What's wrong? Make it all right.
All right, it's gone, so long.
We've got time, all the time.
All the time.
