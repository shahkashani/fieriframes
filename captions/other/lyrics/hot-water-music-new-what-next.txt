I could waste away with politics.
Or drown myself with wine.
Confine myself to solitude.
And inject poison into my mind.
Meanwhile outside, everything still grows.
Wild like fire and fury, while I wish alone.

You know that I can feel the poison in my mind.
You know that I can feel the venom deep inside.
I feel like I am in an endless night.
Like I am falling through the restless sky.

You can't erase them.
Every lie you've told.
For then they'd leave you.
And haunt you nevermore.

I could find myself in paradise.
Walk on endless shores.
Cut my feet so drastically before I beg for more.
Meanwhile, in front of me, under every stone.
Lies a thousand reasons with a thousand rhymes.

You can't erase them.
Every lie you've told.
For then they'd leave you.
And haunt you nevermore.
You can't erase them.
Every lie you've told.
For then they'd leave you.
So face them forever more.
It hurts so bad tonight.
Dialing into the payphone that's outside of the show.
Cause everywhere I go my head is just a wreck.
And it's no secret I've been dealing with it.
All I know is that I want to go.

To the end of the line but it's obviously time.
To stop this empty train and let somebody in.

A hundred thousand nights.
Always moving to finally feel alright.
Though unsure if it will endure.

To the end of the line but it's obviously time.
To stop this empty train and let somebody in.
Cause even here tonight where I'm so wound up inside.
I know that it's time, it's time.
To the end of the line but it's obviously time.
To stop this empty train and let somebody in.
To the end of the line but it's obviously time.
To stop this empty train and let somebody in.
Where did it begin?
The skip in time, the spark of sin.
Corrupted minds were let to stand with.
A head and tongue intact.
All I ask is how we carry on.
Tricked and blind, raped and robbed.
Shutting our mouths so not to speak.
And falling down to our knees.

All heads down to bow.
All heads down to bow to nothing.
Because nothing will save you.

It's you and yourself alone.
'Cause in the end, you're own your own.
So don't crawl into the pitiful.
Burrow of followers.

Where time erodes the strength and will.
We've got to hold to withstand the disarray.
That brings us down to our knees.

All heads down to bow.
All heads down to bow to nothing.
Because nothing will save you.

It's you and yourself alone.
Because in the end, you're own your own.
Don't crawl into the pitiful.
Burrow of followers.

Stay upright and strong.
Before the choice is gone.
And freedom fades like promises.
Made for the trade.
Of the vote in the game.
In the game.
In the game.
Baby, I.
Am waiting for a ride.
And it may take some time.
But you know I would fly if I could fly.
Climb if I could climb.
And my dreams.
As everything with me.
Are just like that.
Where I see the place I need to be.
But not the way there.

Cause all the things that we have seen.
Are all the things we want to show.
But all the things that we have seen.
Are not always the things we ever really know.

Baby, this is such a pretty mess.
My little monkey wrench.
And it sits.
Where all the machinists.
Can examine it.
And that's fine, I like reading their minds.
As they're figuring.
Odds and times.
It's pointless, but it's fine.
There's nothing to find.

Cause all the things that we have seen.
Are all the things we want to show.
But all the things that we have seen.
Are not always the things we ever really know.
Cause all the things that we have seen.
Are all the things we want to show.
But all the things that we have seen.
Are not always the things we ever really know.
What's there to think about?
It's coming in clear.
It all changed so fast, and I disappeared.
And the time it took to come out of, come out of where I'd been.
Was like coughing bricks.
My head was thick and heavy with wondering.
Like the time when I was ready for the end.

I will be under everything.
I'm coming closer than you think.
I will be under everything.
Time is such a wasted luxury.

What do you think of all these last years?
It all seemed so slow, till they disappeared.
And the will it took to climb out of that hole.
That I'd been in.
Past the dirty tricks, full of politics.
Left me stretched thin.
Like the time I was ready for the end.

I will be under everything.
I'm coming closer than you think.
I will be under everything.
Time is such a wasted luxury.

We are on the wall in the second hand slow dance.
Waltzing round on our way down.
Just below it all.
Under everything waltzing round so slow.
I found that time is such a wasted luxury.

I will be under everything.
I'm coming closer than you think.
I will be under everything.
I'm coming closer than you think.
Time is such a wasted luxury.
So, I guess by now, You're already cool.
Nothing like earlier today.
When I thought that all the things.
That you said.
You just got carried away.

How do you return from a weekend like this?
This is a fucked up holiday.
And I'm feeling confused.
I'm feeling, not mislead.
But like I'm just a fool.

And if you say it now.
If you say it now.
If you say it now.
There are already roses on our grave.

I've never counted on the road quite like this.
It's the only solid thing today.
Cause I'm just holding on.
Hardly awake, so mixed up in everything.

And if you say it now.
If you say it now.
If you say it now.
There are already roses on our grave.
Keep it together now.
As you wish as you know how.
It'll all work out.
When nothing ever seems to be.
Exactly what you need now.
Hold fast now, to drench yourself and last.

All that you know.
Is all that you've figured out.
But you'll never land again.
Until you stop falling down.

Don't let yourself wither now.
Perpendicular to the ground.
It'll all work out.
And don't ever doubt the days.
As if they're not apt to change now.
It'll all come around.
So brace yourself and last.

All that you know.
Is all that you've figured out.
But you'll never land again.
Until you stop falling down.
All that you know.
Is all that you've figured out.
But you'll never land again.
Until you stop falling down.

So alive.
Even cut down to size.
We're here to recognize.
Our place in time.
The role we play, the days we make.
And the ones made without.
Us around.
We all must carry on.
When we can't carry on.
With what we want now.

All that you know.
Is all that you've figured out.
But you'll never land again.
Until you stop falling down.
All that you know.
Is all that you've figured out.
But you'll never land again.
Until you stop falling down.
All that you know.
Is all that you've figured out.
But you'll never land again.
Until you stop falling down.
I get deflated thinking about this now.
But I've got got so far away.
From where I thought I would be.
And this town with it's burning air.
And downpours everyday is weighing hard on me.

But I can't fight the ebb and flow.
It's still pulling me.

And shifting all the time.
The ebb and flow pulling me with it.
Asking me all the time to give in to it.
And shifting all the time.
The ebb and flow pulling me with it.
Asking me all the time to give in to it.

I'm equating this town.
As this thing that defines me.
But where I go I still will be.
And I'm wrong so long as I remain.
Letting the past hold on to me.
Letting myself get lost in it.

But I can't fight the ebb and flow.
It's still pulling me.

And shifting all the time.
The ebb and flow pulling me with it.
Asking me all the time to give into it.
And shifting all the time.
The ebb and flow pulling me with it.
Asking me all the time to give in to it.
Just like this once.
When I was just like a door.
Open to anything.
Open to restless nights.
It feels the same.
Like I'm burning for the flame.
The fire in the night.
I burn for it, despite.
The journey, I believe.
That leads to bottomless seas.

And the hard ground.
The barren and frozen ground.
It seems hard to cross it.
Cause I'm walking backwards.
But this journey, I believe.
Will lead to bottomless seas.

Rolling in the twilight for all time.
That swallows every fire.
The fire that grows.
Rolling in the twilight for all time.
That swallows every fire.
The fire that grows.

Don't calm me down.
My head is starting to pound.
Please don't change anything.
I am still waking up.
To these old sounds.
The same kind that drove me out.
Are leading me back now.
I've been walking in circles.
But this journey, I believe.
Will lead me to bottomless seas.

Rolling in the twilight for all time.
That swallows every fire.
The fire that grows.
Rolling in the twilight for all time.
That swallows every fire.
The fire that grows.
In the distance, far away but clear.
Was a light that blinded everything and near.
Was an opening so inviting.
That question and fear just disappeared.
Then the path was seen.
Like recalling dreams.
With the wits of knowing them both apart.

Hold on.
Hold onto the feeling that pulls us through.

And we will survive time after time.
And all these dreams we speak.
And words we read won't be.
Just ink and lead, or sound from breath.
Better left just burning in the coals.

Hold on.
Hold onto the feeling and reason too.
Hold on.
Hold onto these four words, "In love with you".

It seems like we have the same dreams.
It seems like we want the same things.
A beginning.
So right now, there's no doubt.

Hold on.
Hold onto the feeling and reason too.
Hold on.
Hold onto these four words, "In love with you".
Hold on.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Take it away, I've had enough.
And I shoulda known better.
I shoulda known better.
Take it away, my head is low.
Like a burning lantern.
I shoulda known better.

In time my reactions slow.

All day, running high and low.
I try to stay distracted.
But it's calling me in.
In a bad way, in a nervous tone.
That I should remember.
I should've known better.

In time my reactions slow.
And I know the reason.
In time my reactions slow.
But I've got a reason.
That I'm regarding.
This early grave, this early grave.
As my new garden.

Take it away, I've had enough.
And I shoulda known better.
I shoulda known better.
Take it away, my head is low.
Like a burning lantern.
I shoulda known better.

In time my reactions slow.
And I know the reason.
In time my reactions slow.
But I've got a reason.
That I'm regarding.
This early grave, this early grave.
As my new garden.
Dream wild in waves of confidence and heart.
Don't underestimate the power of your part.
Throw the rules away.
Trust your gut and make it.
On your own.

Don't underestimate the glories of the road.
Because when you're on your own you've got it all.
Throw the rules away.
To stand and deliver now.
All is yours.

I don't want to sit back to slack and waste it all.
Since surrounded with the "Hearts and Souls".
I'll get back on my feet, wash my hands clean.
And roll back to the front to sing out.
"Here we go!".
Here we go, here we go, here we go.

Throw the rules away.
To stand and deliver now.
All is yours.

I don't want to sit back to slack and waste it all.
Since surrounded with the "Hearts and Souls".
I'll get back on my feet, wash my hands clean.
And roll back to the front to sing out.
"Here we go!".
I don't want to sit back to slack and waste it all.
Since surrounded with the "Hearts and Souls".
I'll get back on my feet, wash my hands clean.
And roll back to the front to sing out.
"Here we go!".
It's hard to rest right.
With a different pillow every night.
Still I close my eyes.
And dream I'll make it home.
And ever now and then I.
Find my dreams before I learn.
That every mountain call of what I yearn.
It's a blessing and a curse.

Wait 'till the lunacy shakes the hand of reality.
Time will fly and straight our lives.
As we all live to die.
Holding on to anything.
It's hard to find the in-between.
Of burning candles at both ends.
We're bored and petrified.

We love to kill the night.
Pay tolls with Blood and Time.
Our body, souls, and minds.
Rectify TONIGHT!

Deep inside on the proving ground.
There's always war to wage.
And the bloodshed of our demons here.
Have covered everything.
Nazerath's seen the Romans lost.
And Balthor's crying eyes.
Find ourselves on the road.
That always takes us by surprise.
