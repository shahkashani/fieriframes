Never mind all the riddles.
We're all sick the same.
Bled dry and beaten.
But still quick to blame.
All the marks, all the nicks.
On all the ragged excuses.

Never mind all the railing.
They'll all get their own.
Shot down and plundered.
Shipped out and sold.
For all the marks.
All the nicks by all the pessimistic tricks.

We are here and time is relevant.
To mainline every worthy element.

Never mind all the riddles.
We're all sick the same.
Bled dry and beaten.
For there ain't no shame.
In taking hits, cuts or nicks.
As long as there's no excuses.

We are here and time is relevant.
To mainline every worthy element.

Or are we emptiness?
Are we dead to this?
When will it all end?
May we cure the catalyst?
Are we emptiness?
Are we dead to this?

We are here and time is relevant.
To mainline every worthy element now.
Boy, you're gonna hurt someone.
Boy, you're gonna hurt someone.
Boy, you're gonna hurt someone.
Boy, you're gonna hurt someone.

Everybody call your number.
Everybody hunt for you.
Everybody getting closer.
No one ever wanted to.

Life's getting strange.
Flying backwards to the cage.

Everybody getting closer.
Everybody hunt for you.
Everybody moving faster.
Everybody learn from you.
Gonna have to run like you've never run.
Gonna have to fly or they'll find you.
Gonna have to come down like everyone.
Gonna have to fly or they'll find you.

Life's getting strange.
Flying backwards to the cage.
Oh, I for one may not shy.
Away from the fact that I'm sick.
And too tired to stand this.
It all seems contagious.
I know a few would back that up.
Can't say a few is not enough.
To skip a beat in this motion sickness.
I'd second that emotion.

Our state.
Our state.
Our state of grace is gone.
Our state.
Our state.
Our state of grace is gone.

Oh, I for one don't want to die.
Old and in the way from poison.
'Cause I hate the taste of medicine.
We all hate the taste of medicine.
I know a few would back that up.
Can't say a few is not enough.
To skip a beat in this motion sickness.
I'd second that emotion.

Our state.
Our state.
Our state of grace is gone.
Our state.
Our state.
Our state of grace is gone away.

Our state of grace is crumbling.
I fear we're good for nothing.
And simply disintegrating into the terra firma.

Our state.
Our state.
Our state of grace is gone.
Our state.
Our state.
Our state of grace is gone.

May we combine tradition.
Science and innovation.
To benefit what's ailing.
Our state of grace is gone.
Not understanding.
Not anymore.
Never believing.
The plan no more.
Cause we drown.
We drown in it.
Still hopeful.
A little bit.
Between kinda living.
And really gone.
Right off the deep end.
Sunk like a stone.
Cause we drown.
We drown in it.
Still hopeful.
A little bit.
Not understanding.
Under the weight here again.
Never believing.
It means anything in the end.
Cause we drown.
We drown in it.
Still hopeful.
A little bit.
Well I got my heart up in a beautiful mess.
I should’ve known better when I took the risk.
To wreck myself and to gamble while broke.
Shaking something mental at a loss for the words I’d once known.
I traded two steps forward for three steps back.
To get to know the meaning of showing respect.
I found the pedestals and burned them down.
To kill my idols and to bury the thoughts underground.
I’m no longer deaf to the sounds.

I’m hardly feeling human anymore.
Enough to drag my body from the floor.

Well I got my head up in a critical mass.
Fighting like a demon in a shell I possess.
Gnashing my teeth and speaking in tongues.
Still shaking something mental at a loss of the words I’d once known.
Something’s rattling my bones.

I’m hardly feeling human anymore.
Enough to drag my body from the floor.
I’m hardly feeling human anymore.
Enough to drag my body from the floor.

Stand to hold steady now.
To take a breath and somehow.
Take a step to begin again.
After all we can only do our best.

I’m hardly feeling human anymore.
Enough to drag my body from the floor.
I’m hardly feeling human anymore.
Enough to drag my body from the floor.

Stand and hold steady now.
We're safe for now but that will fade away.
It's the same old line that we bought yesterday.
It don't take no time just what you think you save.
You're still free to live if you can find a place.
Quick to rise, quick to fall.
Sometimes I don't even care at all.

They don't need no lies to sell you anything.
Cause I want it now more than I want to say.
Don't need you blind, just take the light away.
And that sweetness turns into a belly ache.
Better run, better tell the others.
Cause I don't control it anymore.
Gonna find some kind of cover.
And let it burn.
You live and you learn.

Another time.
Another place.
Another time.
Another place.
They never change.

Everybody say they're going.
Gonna shut 'em down.
They get around.
Gonna come back with a story.
If they return.
You're gonna get burned.

Another time.
Another place.
Another time.
Another place.
They never change.
Fire away.
If you know where you stand now.
Do you know where you stand?
Cause it's hard to make out.
On this tired old ground.
With no real changes.
Just these strange arrangements.
That fall right back down.
Cause it's all wrong.
But don't take it the wrong way.
Wherever we go we find something wrong.
Together.

Fire away.
This some bad business.
Another night wasted.
We fall right back down.
Cause it's all wrong.
It's all wrong.
But don't take it the wrong way.
Wherever we go we find something wrong.
Together.
She was stable and he buckled for nothing.
Since nothing worth anything comes easy now.
They got caught looking at time through a window.
At someone they should know or they may soon forget.

Bury the dying dread, steadfast instead of fatalistic.
Bury the dying dread before the fall and final hour's gone.

Some days we must surrender.
Or start building a "take no prisoner" road.
The weight of departure will help heed the warnings.
The red lights and sirens that rattle cage and shore.

Bury the dying dread, steadfast instead of fatalistic.
Bury the dying dread before the fall and final hour's gone.
Gotta get gone like a bat on a mission.
Out of this hell not enough sedition.
Give em all you got and you better believe they'll walk.
All over you, leaving smoke and ashes and.
Burning up faith with their "fine intentions.".
A "noble cause" can bend as fast as the law.

You're pledge wore thin.
Now we're all in.

Gotta get gone get stable, steady.
I'd rather walk slow than to run with a cut throat.
Give em all you got and you better believe they'll talk.
All about you breaking skin on your back.
It's just a little dagger; it's just a little blade right?
But there'll be more and they don't bend at all.

You're pledge wore thin.
Now we're all in.
And time must mend.
Truth must win.
And we're all ears.

Savor fever, savor the sin.
Bleed for lessons and don't stop to fall into.
Sanctimony, a self righteous story, condemned and surely.
Holier than thou while screaming freedom.
Far far away from the truth condition.

Your pledge wore thin.
Now we're all in.
Your pledge wore thin.
Now we're all in.
And time must mend.
Truth must win.
And we're all ears.
There's no end left in sight.
Wipe the dirt from your eyes.
Set your feet in the mud.
Yesterday come undone.
In the gathering flood.
So much work to be done.
In the lingering light.
From somewhere else.

There's no end left in sight.
Won't be sleeping tonight.
Don't get carried away.
Everyone makes mistakes.
In the gathering flood.
So much work to be done.
In the lingering light.
From somewhere else.
I said alright, cause you never know.
You never find what you want if you stay too close.
I headed out in the morning rain.
Past all the stands on the side of the old highway.
But they don't need to know.
We see the ones waiting to greet you.
All of the guns kinda give 'em away.
It ain't no fun lookin' in the rear view.
On another run to remember my name.
Not holding on, or letting go.
Just trying to find a little piece of what I don't know.
It's all the same really anyway.
We never bend till we feel like we're 'bout to break.
But they don't need to know.
We see the ones waiting to greet you.
All of the guns kinda give 'em away.
It ain't no fun lookin' in the rear view.
On another run to remember my name.
But it won't be long.
Move right along.
Like you've been here before.
There's nothing to see.
But what we leave.
Ashes on the floor.
But they don't need to know.
We see the ones waiting to greet you.
All of the guns kinda give 'em away.
It ain't no fun lookin' in the rear view.
On another run to remember my name.
With everyone just counting the greys.
Out for blood.
By any means necessary.
Messing up, cause there ain't no choice.
For any other way since.
You got nowhere to go.
You got nowhere to go.
You burned up all you loved.
You're burning up all you saved.

Feed the fire to rid the head of wreck from desire.
Paid in full and left for darker floods.

Out for blood.
By any means necessary.
You'd trade your trust if.
It meant that you would always get your way.
All to sell your soul.
All to sell your soul.
You burned up all you loved.
You're burning up all you saved.

Feed the fire to rid the head of wreck from desire.
Paid in full, bred in darkness for fire to rid the head.
Of wreck from desire paid in full and left for darker floods.

You let it all slip away.
Burned up all that saved.
To rid the wreckage inside the brain.
There's no care anymore.
The judging hour's come.
To put us all in place and.
Trade that fire to gratify.
A penance paid in full.

Feed the fire to rid the head of wreck from desire.
Paid in full, bred in darkness for fire to rid the head.
A wreck from desire paid in full and left for darker floods.
