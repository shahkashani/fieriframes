If I am alive this time next year.
Will I have arrived in time to share?
And mine is about as good this far.
And I'm still applied to what you are.

And I am joining all my thoughts to you.
And I'm preparing every part for you.

And I heard from the trees a great parade.
And I heard from the hills a band was made.
And will I be invited to the sound?
And will I be a part of what you've made?

And I am throwing all my thoughts away.
And I'm destroying every bet I've made.
And I am joining all my thoughts to you.
And I'm preparing every part for you.
For you.
I can see a lot of life in you.
I can see a lot of bright in you.
And I think the dress looks nice on you.
I can see a lot of life in you.

I can see a bed and make it too.
I can see a fireside turn blue.
I can see a lot of life in you.
Yes, I can see a lot of life in you.

When the world looks back.
When the face looks after that.
I can see a lot of life in you.
Yes, I can see a lot of life in you.

I can see a lot of life in you.
I can see a bed and make it too.
And I think the dress looks nice on you.
Yes, I can see a lot of life in you.
I can see a lot of life in you.
Yes, I can see a lot of life in you.
Be still and know your sign.
The beast will arrive in time.

We stayed a long, long time.
We stayed a long, long time.
To see you, to beat you.
To see you at last.

I saw the dragons drying.
I saw the witches whine.

We stayed a long, long time.
But I'm not afraid to die.
To see you, to meet you.
To see you at last.

I stole my father's shoes.
I pulled His pockets too.

We stayed a long, long time.
We stayed a long, long time.
To see you, to beat you.
To see you, to meet you.
To see you at last.
I'd swim across Lake Michigan.
I'd sell my shoes.
I'd give my body to be back again.
In the rest of the room.

To be alone with you.
To be alone with you.
To be alone with you.
To be alone with you.

You gave your body to the lonely.
They took your clothes.
You gave up a wife and a family.
You gave your ghost.

To be alone with me.
To be alone with me.
To be alone with me.
You went up on a tree.

To be alone with me.
You went up on a tree.

I've never known a man who loved me.
Abraham, worth a righteous one.
Take up on the wood.
Put it on your son.
Lake or lamb.
There is none to harm.
When the angel came.
You had raised your arm.

Abraham, put off on your son.
Take instead the ram.
Until Jesus comes.

What the water wants is hurricanes.
And sailboats to ride on its back.
What the water wants is sun kiss.
And land to run in to and back.

And I have a fish stone.
Burning my elbow.
Reminding me to know that I'm glad.

And I have a bottle.
Filled with my old teeth.
They fell out like a tear in the bag.

And I have a sister.
Somewhere in Detroit.
She has black hair and small hands.

And I have a kettledrum.
I'll hit the earth with you.
And I will crochet you a hat.

And I have a red kite.
I'll put you right in it.
I'll show you the sky.
I was the best man in a size too small.
You were my best friend, going at it all.
What if I put off my inheritance?
Where is the best man?
All arise us all in peace.

I still know you.
And I still like you, the best man.
I still owe you.

Everything rises, going at it all.
All the surprises in a size too small.
And what if I told you.
I was still in love with this?
Would you surprise us.
In a size for all of me?

I still know you.
And I still like you, the best man.
I still know you, the best man.
I still owe you.
So faithful, so few.
So pardon, and done.
And when we receive.
We give a change at last.

When we are dead.
We all have wings.
We won't need legs to stand.
And when we receive.
To see a change at last.
Once in the backyard.
She was once like me.
She was once like me.
Twice when I killed them.
They were once at peace.
They were once like me.

Hold to your gun, man.
And put off all your peace.
And put off all the beast.
Paid a full of these, I wait for it.
But someone's once like me.
She was once like me.

I once was better.
I put off all my grief.
I put off all my grief.
And so I go to hell, I wait for it.
But someone's left me creased.
And someone's left me creased.
He was, he was in the churchyard.
My father was in the first part.
He came, he came to my bedroom.
But I was asleep.
He woke me up again to say:

Halle, Halle, Hallelujah.
Holy, holy is the sound.

And I hope, I hope you are tired out.
And I know, I know there is joy endowed.
But I was asleep.
And he woke me up again.
And he woke me up again to say:

Hold on, hold on to your old ways.
Or put off, put off every old face.
And I know, I know you are changed now.
I hope, I hope you're arranged out.
But I'm still asleep.
And you woke me up again.
And I'm still asleep.
But you woke me up to be holy.
We didn't sleep too late.
There was a fire in the yard.
All of the trees were in light.
They had no faces to show.
I saw a sign in the sky.
Seven swans, seven swans, seven swans.
I heard a voice in my mind.
"I will try, I will try, I will try.
I will try, I will try, I will try".

We saw the dragon move down.
My father burned into coal.
My mother saw it from afar.
She took her purse to the bed.
I saw a sign in the sky.
Seven horns, seven horns, seven horns.
I heard a voice in my mind.
"I am Lord, I am Lord, I am Lord".
He said, "I am Lord, I am Lord, I am Lord".
He said, "I am Lord, I am Lord, I am Lord".

He will take you.
If you run.
He will chase you.
He will take you.
If you run.
He will chase you.
Because He is the Lᴏʀᴅ.
Cause He is the Lᴏʀᴅ.
Cause He is the Lᴏʀᴅ.
Cause He is the Lᴏʀᴅ.

Cause He is the Lᴏʀᴅ.
(Seven swans, seven swans, seven swans, seven swans, seven swans)
Cause He is the Lᴏʀᴅ.
(Seven swans, seven swans, seven swans, seven swans, seven swans)
Cause He is the Lᴏʀᴅ.
(Seven swans, seven swans, seven swans, seven swans, seven swans)
When He took the three disciples to the mountainside to pray.
His countenance was modified, his clothing was aflame.
Two men appeared; Moses and Elijah came.
They were at his side.
The prophecy, the legislation spoke of whenever he would die.

Then there came a word.
Of what he should accomplish on the day.
Then Peter spoke, to make of them a tabernacle place.
A cloud appeared in glory as an accolade.
They fell on the ground.
A voice arrived, the voice of God.
The face of God, covered in a cloud.

What he said to them.
The voice of God: the most beloved son.
Consider what he says to you, consider what's to come.
The prophecy was put to death.
Was put to death, and so will the Son.
And keep your word, disguise the vision till the time has come.

Lost in the cloud, a voice: Have no fear! We draw near!
Lost in the cloud, a sign: Son of man! Turn your ear!
Lost in the cloud, a voice: Lamb of God! We draw near!
Lost in the cloud, a sign: Son of man! Son of God!
