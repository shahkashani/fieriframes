I am a patient boy.
I wait, I wait, I wait, I wait.
My time is like water down a drain.
Everybody's moving, everybody's moving.
Everybody's moving, moving, moving, moving.
Please don't leave me to remain.
In the waiting room.

I don't want the news (I cannot use it)
I don't want the news (I won't live by it)
Sitting outside of town.
Everybody's always down (Tell me why?)
Because they can't get up.

(Ahh, come on and get up)
(Come on and get up)

But I don't sit idly by (ahh)
I'm planning a big surprise.
I'm gonna fight for what I wanna be.
And I won't make the same mistakes (Because I know)
Because I know how much time that wastes.
(And function), function is the key.
To the the waiting room.

I don't want the news (I cannot use it)
I don't want the news (I won't live by it)
Sitting outside of town.
Everybody's always down (Tell me why?)
Because they can't get up.

(Ahh, come on and get up)

Up for the waiting room.

Sitting in the waiting room (ahh)
Sitting in the waiting room (ahh)
Sitting in the waiting room (ahh)
Sitting in the waiting room (Tell me why?)
Because they can't get up.
Ahistorical.
You think this shit just dropped right out of the sky.
My analysis:
It's time to harvest the crust from your eyes.
To surge and refine.
To rage and define ourselves.
Against your line.
So sorry friend, you must resign.

You want to figure it out.
We'll throw down.
We'll throw down.
We'll throw down.
You want to figure it out.
Well throw down your bulldog front.

Bold, bold mouth talking, not so bold.
Now that you've eaten your own.
Lips flecked, mouth specked.
You strip the skin right off of the bone.
But I would never say.
You act without precision or care, but.
It's all attention to armor.
To the armor you wear so well.

You want to figure it out.
We'll throw down.
We'll throw down.
You want to figure it out.
We'll throw down your bulldog front.

You want to figure it out.
You want to figure it out.

Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home.
Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home.
Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home.
Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home.

Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home.
Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home.
Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home.
Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home.

You want to figure it out.
We'll throw down and.
We'll throw down.
You want to figure it out.
We'll throw down your bulldog front.

You want to figure it out.
You want to figure it out.
You can't be what you were.
So you better start being.
Just what you are.
You can't be what you were.
The time is now, it's running out.
It's running out, it's running, running, running out.

You can't be what you were.
So you better start living the life.
That you're talking about.
You can't be what you were.
The no movement, the no movement.
The no movement in a bad mouth.

It betrays a bad mind.
The no movement, the no movement.
The no movement in a bad mouth.
It betrays a bad mind.
The no movement, the no movement.

It betrays a bad mind.
The no movement, the no movement.
The no movement, in a bad mouth.
It betrays a bad mind.

You're always talking, talking, talking, talking, talking shit now.
But you will talk yourself down.
You're going way down!
There's something acting on this body.
Something goes in when nothing comes out.
And someone's acting on this information.
But nothing's registered from this location.

From this site that I sense that I am in asking.
What is this burning in my eyes?
What is this burning in my eyes?
What is this burning in my eyes?
What is this burning in my eyes?

I wanted a language of my own.
My lips were sucked empty and I mouthed the lines.
Of this crowd that surrounds me.
Punctured and parcelled I fold my hand.

To this site that I sense that I am in asking.
What is this burning in my eyes?
What is this burning in my eyes?
What is this burning my eyes?
There’s something acting but it doesn’t complete.
Don't you know what I mean?

There's something burning in my eyes.
There's something burning in my eyes.
There's something burning in my eyes.
There's something burning my eyes.
I never thought too hard on dying before.
I never sucked on the dying.
I never licked the side of dying before.
And now I'm feeling the dying.

You've got your hands over your ears.
You've got your mouth running on.
You've got your eyes looking for something.
That can never be found.
Like a reason.
Good god, I don't need a reason.

I never thought too hard on dying before.
I never thought on the dying.
I never ever held the hand of dying before.
And now I'm feeling the dying.

And you've got to, and you've got to.
And you've got to.
Gimme the shot.
Gimme the pill.
Gimme the cure.
Now what you've done to my world.

I never thought too hard on dying before.
I never thought on the dying.
I never walked the side of dying before.
And now I'm feel like I'm...
And now I'm feel like I'm... (it breaks, it breaks, it breaks, yeah)

Under your skin.
Cap over your eyes.
I'm at the tip of your finger.
(it breaks, it breaks, it breaks, yeah)

Tell me the reason.
Gimme the shot.
Gimme the pill.
Gimme the cure (it breaks, it breaks, it breaks)
Now what you've done to my world.

(Coming around, coming around)
(Coming around, coming down)

(Give me the shot)
(Give me the pill)
(Give me the cure)
(Now what you've done to my world)

(Give me the shot)
Now c'mon (give me the pill)
(Give me the cure)
(Now what you've done to my world)
Gimme the shot.
Why can't I walk down a street free of suggestion?
Why can't I walk down a street free of suggestion?

Is my body my only trait in the eyes of men?
In the eyes of men.

I've got some skin.
When you want to look in.
I've got some.

There lays no reward (in what you, in what you)
In what you discover.
You spent yourself, boy.
Watching me suffer.
Suffer your words, suffer your eyes, suffer your hands.
Suffer your interpretation (of what it is)
Of what it is (what it is)
What it is (what it is)
What it is (what it is) to be a man.

I've got some skin.
When you wanna look in.
Well, I've got some.

She does nothing to deserve it.
He touches her 'cause he wants to observe it.
We sit back like they taught us.
We keep quiet like they taught us.

He just wants, he wants to prove it.
She does nothing to remove it.
We don't want anyone to mind us.
So we play the roles that they assigned us.

She does nothing to conceal it.
He touches her 'cause he wants to feel it.
We blame her for being there.
We are all here.
But we are all...
Guilty!
I.
I spent it all.
I.
I spent it all.
On the bag.
On the drag.
I.
I spent it all.

The sun comes up, the tide rolls out.
The trucks roll by the park, still a park.
Where children play, pick up stones.
Anything to make them feel less alone - he's alone.
His mind is his own town.
Where his thoughts run aground.
They fall all over and down.

I.
I spent it all.
I.
I spent it all.
On the bag (can't you see)
On the drag.
I.
I spent it all.

The sun comes down, the tide rolls back.
We crawl our way back to the house we call home.
He holds his home in the palm of his hand (and says)
And he says, and he says.
You are my everyone.
You are my anyone.
You are my anytime.
You are my everytime.
You are my anywhere.
You are my everywhere.
You are my anytime.
You are my anytime.
You are my anytime.
You are my everywhere.
You are mine.

And he says, and I say.
And he says, and I say, I say.
You are my everyone.
You are my anyone.
You are my anytime.
You are my everytime.
You are my anywhere.
You are my everywhere.
You are my anytime.
You are my anytime.
Everywhere.
Anywhere.
Everywhere.
Anywhere.
