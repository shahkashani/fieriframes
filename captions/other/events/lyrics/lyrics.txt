An apple and a berry plant.|Comes with a house.
On the grass.|Who is that?|To come by my house.
Stands outside my window.|Sucking on the berries and|Eats us out of house and home.
Keeping us awake.|Keeping us awake.
Can I come over? I need to rest.|Lay down for a while.|Disconnect.
The night was so long.|The day even longer.|Lay down for a while.|Recollect.
Five AM.|Out again.|Triangle walks.
Magpies, I throw sticks at them.|They laugh behind my back.
Getting a feeling.|Maybe I will dream again.|Having that feeling.|When there's no one awake.|No no one awake.
Can I come over?|I need to rest.|Lay down for a while.|Disconnect.
The night was so long.|The day even longer.|Lay down for a while.|Recollect.
Can I come over? I need to rest.|Lay down for a while, disconnect.|The night was so long.|The day even longer.|Lay down for a while, recollect.
