00:00:02,545 --> 00:00:06,298
<i>Captain's log, stardate 41263. 1.</i>

2
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:08,801
<i>We have rendezvoused
with the USS Fearless</i>

3
00:00:08,968 --> 00:00:12,179
<i>from which</i> a <i>Starfleet
propulsion expert and his assistant</i>

4
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,306
<i>are beaming over to conduct tests</i>

5
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:17,018
<i>on the Enterprise's
warp drive engines.</i>

6
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,103
<i>They have completed
similar adjustments</i>

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,148
<i>on two other Starfleet vessels.</i>

8
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:24,150
I don't understand your concern,
Number One.

9
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,902
They're not authorized
to make any alterations in our engines.

10
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:29,697
According to Starfleet's report,
they will simply run tests

11
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:31,699
on different ways
of entering warp speed

12
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:33,284
and different intermix formulas.

13
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:36,620
- Where's the harm in that?
- It's the specs Kosinski sent us.

14
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:39,832
- In my opinion, sir, they're gibberish.
- Gibberish?

15
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:42,293
Mr. Data, would you explain?

16
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,628
Sir, we put Mr. Kosinski's specs
into the computer

17
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,297
and ran a controlled test on them.

18
00:00:46,464 --> 00:00:48,883
There was no improvement
in engine performance.

19
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,885
Then how do you explain
Starfleet's report

20
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:54,388
that the same tests on the USS Ajax,
and on the <i>Fearless</i> over there,

21
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,807
resulted in a measurable
increase in propulsion?

22
00:00:57,016 --> 00:00:59,810
Our engines are new, sir.
Top condition.

23
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,145
The tests on those older ships

24
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:03,522
may have simply been to straighten out
some inefficiency.

25
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,274
<i>Bridge from transporter chief.</i>

26
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,611
Two from USS Fearless
are <i>ready</i> to beam over.

27
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,031
Stand by for Mr. Riker, chief.
He's on his way.

28
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:13,449
<i>Aye, sir.</i>

29
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:15,659
Since you're concerned
about these tests.

30
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:17,328
Yes, sir.

31
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:21,207
Captain, if I may,

32
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:23,626
I'll ask Counselor Troi
to look these visitors over.

33
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,878
Very good.

34
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:50,236
Welcome aboard, Mr. Kosinski.

35
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:52,446
I'm the first officer,
Commander William Riker.

36
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,907
- And this is--
- Where is the captain, please?

37
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:57,660
He's engaged in other duties, sir.

38
00:01:57,827 --> 00:02:00,704
A ship's engines should be
the concern of a ship's captain.

39
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,748
They are, sir.
Which is why they have made

40
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:04,500
their first officer directly responsible

41
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:06,877
for an engine's conditions
and performance.

42
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:08,963
Guided, of course,
by one of our chief engineers.

43
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,465
Lieutenant Commander Argyle,
in this case.

44
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:14,885
A pleasure to meet you, sir.
I appreciated receiving the specs.

45
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,138
To which you have
no end of questions.

46
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,306
Aye, I have.

47
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:23,102
- And you, sir, are listed as--
- As Mr. Kosinski's assistant.

48
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:27,022
Uh, my actual name
is unpronounceable by humans.

49
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:30,067
You're from Tau Alpha C.
That's very distant.

50
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:34,238
All approved and described
in the Starfleet communications.

51
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:37,158
Now, I would like to set up
in the engine room immediately.

52
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:40,244
I'll have our chief engineer
show you to his engine room.

53
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:45,040
No need.
I know my way around starships.

54
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,171
One thing that Kosinski isn't hiding?
His bad disposition.

55
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,422
Agreed.

56
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:54,633
Also, he's arrogant, overbearing,
self-important

57
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,012
and very sure of himself
and his ability.

58
00:02:58,179 --> 00:03:02,224
- And the other one, his assistant?
- He's the puzzle.

59
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:05,436
With most life forms,
I can usually feel something.

60
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:07,688
I may not be able to understand
or interpret it

61
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:11,817
but I feel something,
if only a presence.

62
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:16,197
With him, nothing. Empty space.

63
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,991
It's as though he isn't even here.

64
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,660
Something about this concerns me.

65
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:25,372
I don't know what.
I can point to no reason, yet.

66
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,375
But stay concerned, please.

67
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:32,463
The safety of the Enterprise
may be entrusted to these two.

68
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:58,322
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

69
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:02,952
<i>These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.</i>

70
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:08,332
<i>Its continuing mission:
to explore strange new worlds,</i>

71
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:13,045
<i>to seek out new life
and new civilizations,</i>

72
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:17,925
<i>to boldly go where no one
has gone before.</i>

73
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:39,214
Inform the Bridge I shall begin
my first test in precisely 15 minutes.

74
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:42,176
- Why is this child here?
- He's working on a school project.

75
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:44,094
Before you begin,
there are some questions.

76
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,512
First, tell us how you arrived--

77
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:50,184
In order to save myself time,
let me ask those questions for you.

78
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:52,936
You received the information
which Starfleet provided,

79
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:56,190
you fed it into your computer
as precisely as humanly possible,

80
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:58,317
then you did a controlled test.

81
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:01,945
And then, to your astonishment,
nothing happened.

82
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:08,452
So you said, "What's going on?
This doesn't work. Kosinski is a fraud."

83
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:12,331
You see, I have had this conversation
on other Starfleet vessels before.

84
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:14,124
They didn't understand it,
why should you?

85
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,877
Hmm. Surely you're not saying
it's unexplainable.

86
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:20,881
I'm saying I'm not a teacher.
Nor do I wish to become one.

87
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,842
I have neither the inclination,
nor the time.

88
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:28,305
You have all the time you need.

89
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:30,140
I don't think you understand.

90
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,810
This has already been approved
by Starfleet Command.

91
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:36,063
But it hasn't been approved
by the chief engineer or by me.

92
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:40,651
- I didn't know that was necessary.
- Now you do.

93
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:44,696
Perhaps I should speak
to Captain Picard.

94
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:47,449
If you like. It won't change anything.

95
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:53,705
- How basic shall I be?
- I'll leave that to you.

96
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,879
Would you get on
the auxiliary panel, please?

97
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:05,008
In order to save time, my assistant
is going to lay in my base formulas

98
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:08,637
more rapidly than any human being
possibly could, even myself.

99
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:12,224
So here then, in the simplest
possible terms, is what I do.

100
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:15,269
Now, this warp drive system
has been tuned

101
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:19,565
only in the grossest possible sense,
at least, according to my standards.

102
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:22,276
What I do is specific. Thank you.

103
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:24,027
Now, how to say...

104
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:28,323
Well, sufficient to say for now that
these symbols and their relation...

105
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,910
Something troubles you in the way
this is configured?

106
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:35,747
However,
those of you who are sufficient in...

107
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,502
How about it now?

108
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,423
Yes.

109
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:48,302
But shouldn't these be connected?

110
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:49,887
Here?

111
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:53,891
And here.

112
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:03,317
Now will it do
what Kosinski says it will?

113
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:06,111
It has a chance.

114
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:10,866
It might work better this way.

115
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:14,745
Yes.

116
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,375
View with me this screen
as we consider the following.

117
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:24,254
Now, is this merely mechanics
or is it nature

118
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:25,839
that we deal with in all of this?

119
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:30,427
And what else than nature
are the elementals of space and time?

120
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:33,764
You are trained in the system,
you are-- You go in a straight line.

121
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:36,016
Confident, yes,
perhaps even innovative

122
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,809
in a minimalist sort of way,

123
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:41,396
but what I do here
is not the end of the process.

124
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,023
It is the beginning.

125
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,068
<i>So, what do I do?
Go back to the Fearless,</i>

126
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:49,696
which I left with a more efficient
warp drive system than I found?

127
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:53,450
Or do you cast off your ignorance
and allow me to continue?

128
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,454
Can anything he's proposing
damage our system?

129
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:00,207
- How could it'? It's meaningless.
- Then we should let him try it.

130
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:01,875
What do you mean, let him try it?

131
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:05,379
Don't talk about me in the third person
as if I'm not standing right here.

132
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,005
Yes, we might as well let him try it.

133
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,549
"We might as well let him try it."

134
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:13,804
You are too generous.
Boy. Boy. Don't play with that.

135
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:25,148
Captain, Main Engineering
is ready to proceed.

136
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,777
Engineering, this is the Bridge.
It's your call.

137
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:32,781
Do this one just like the last time.
Nothing changes.

138
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:37,452
Commander, I'll make my
preliminary adjustments at warp 1.5

139
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:41,123
and complete them
as we achieve warp 4.

140
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,001
Engineering to Bridge,
did you copy that?

141
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,837
Affirmative, Number One.

142
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,881
- You ready?
- We are.

143
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,134
La Forge, <i>set in</i> warp 1.5.

144
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:55,679
Warp 1.5, sir.

145
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,347
Engage.

146
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,605
All right, here we go.

147
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,053
What are you doing?

148
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,381
Captain, we're passing warp 10.

149
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,153
- What is our velocity?
- It's off the scale, sir.

150
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,699
Reverse engines.

151
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:42,661
Captain, no one has ever
reversed engines at this velocity.

152
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:46,081
Because no one has gone this fast.
Reverse engines.

153
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:57,259
- All stop.
- Reading all stop, sir.

154
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:07,853
- Position?
- Calculating it, sir.

155
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:10,439
Data, what do you read over there?

156
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:15,235
- A malfunction, I trust.
- Position, Mr. La Forge?

157
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,696
Well, sir,
according to these calculations

158
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:21,283
we've not only left our own galaxy
but passed through two others,

159
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,910
ending up on
the far side of Triangulum.

160
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:29,166
- The galaxy known as M33.
- That's not possible.

161
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,127
Data, what distance
have we traveled?

162
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:34,838
Two million, 700,000 light years, sir.

163
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:39,468
- I can't accept that.
- You must, sir.

164
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,429
Our comparisons
show it to be completely accurate.

165
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,474
And I calculate
that at maximum warp, sir,

166
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,351
it would take over

167
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:52,606
300 years to get home.

168
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:05,827
<i>Captain's log, stardate 41263.2.</i>

169
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:11,666
<i>This will be a rather unusual log entry,
assuming Starfleet ever receives it.</i>

170
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:15,629
<i>As I've already informed my crew,
a phenomenal surge of power</i>

171
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,673
<i>during a warp speed experiment
has sent our starship</i>

172
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,551
<i>hurtling out of our own galaxy
and past another,</i>

173
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:25,472
<i>taking us over 2, 700, 000 light years</i>

174
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:27,349
<i>in a few minutes.</i>

175
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:30,352
The message on this has already been
transmitted to Starfleet, sir.

176
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,645
Which traveling subspace,

177
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:35,357
they should receive in 51 years,
10 months, 9 weeks, 16 days--

178
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:38,109
- Mr. Data.
- Sir?

179
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:45,283
Captain Picard, I presume.

180
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,244
We're still trying to determine
what happened.

181
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,037
The truth is, captain,
I made a mistake.

182
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:53,166
- A wonderful, incredible mistake.
- Just explain what brought us here.

183
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:57,128
As the power grew,
I applied the energy asymptomatically.

184
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,589
I anticipated some tiling
but it didn't occur.

185
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:00,924
Now, that was my error,

186
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,844
using the Bessel functions
at the beginning.

187
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,387
What is he saying, Number One?

188
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:08,056
To tell the truth, sir,
it sounds like nonsense to me.

189
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:11,268
- But considering-
- Considering

190
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:16,356
where we are,
you must assume it isn't.

191
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,569
Can I do something to help?

192
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:26,658
- I can call my mother. She's a doctor.
- No, there's nothing she can do.

193
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:30,912
I need to rest.
I've been away too long.

194
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:35,250
What happened to you?
Is it part of what happened to the ship?

195
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:40,463
Please believe me, I mean no harm
to this vessel or those in it.

196
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,218
Is Mr. Kosinski like he sounds?

197
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:49,014
- A joke?
- Heh, no, that's too cruel.

198
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,684
He has sensed
some small part of this.

199
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:58,315
That space and time and thought

200
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:02,319
aren't the separate things
they appear to be?

201
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:07,032
I thought the formula you were using
said something like that.

202
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,075
Boy, don't ever say that again.

203
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:13,079
Especially not at your age,
in a world that's not ready for such...

204
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:17,626
Such dangerous nonsense.

205
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:20,545
I've always suspected
that this rate of speed was possible,

206
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:23,214
of course, but at this level, ha, ha,

207
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,216
HO, never.

208
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:28,720
We're going to need new definitions,
new parameters.

209
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:32,599
Perhaps you could call it
the Kosinski Scale.

210
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,727
Why not? Yes, of course.

211
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:37,103
Since I'm the one who has

212
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,357
made the so-called warp barrier
meaningless.

213
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:43,985
And, captain,
this must be a special thrill for you.

214
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,821
- Thrill?
- Mm-hm. As an explorer.

215
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,657
In three centuries of space travel,

216
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,576
we've charted just 11 per cent
of our galaxy.

217
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:54,955
And then we accomplished this.

218
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,416
Yes, but isn't the real point,

219
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,752
can you do it again?

220
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,295
Can you get us home?

221
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,924
Well, of course, I can.

222
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:09,761
I'll just do what I did before.

223
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,515
Coming, Riker?

224
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:15,892
Commander Riker
will join you in a moment.

225
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,321
Comment is invited. Counselor?

226
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:33,326
He's convinced he's right.
I've no doubt of that.

227
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,496
Captain, can you allow a man
who has made one mistake

228
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,124
back into a position
where he may make another?

229
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,418
Captain, what are our options really?

230
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,920
I mean, if this guy can't get us back,
who will?

231
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:46,256
Captain, we're here.

232
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:49,342
Why not avail ourselves
of this opportunity for study?

233
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,721
There is a giant protostar
here in the process of forming.

234
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:56,224
No other vessel
has been out this far.

235
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,643
Spoken like a true
Starfleet graduate.

236
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:04,107
- It is tempting, eh, Number One?
- Aye, sir, it is.

237
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:07,569
But as they say, sir,
you're the captain.

238
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:10,238
I know that if Kosinski
can get us home,

239
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:14,409
Starfleet can use his technique
to bring back a pure science vessel,

240
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:16,578
do even more.

241
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:21,416
Number One, tell Kosinski
to prepare to get us out of here.

242
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,751
Aye, sir.

243
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:29,340
Do you realize how many
great advancements of mankind

244
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,384
have been tied to speed?

245
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:35,263
This is a moment in history.
Right here, right now.

246
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:39,017
And your names
will be forever linked with mine.

247
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:46,357
Excuse me, Commander Riker.

248
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,069
I don't think he did this.

249
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:50,987
- I think that it was--
- Not now, Wes.

250
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:52,197
Standing by, <i>Number</i> One.

251
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:55,075
Sir, when all this happened,
I was watching his assistant--

252
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,743
I'm sure this is fascinating, Wesley,

253
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,914
and I am looking forward to hearing
all about it, but not right now.

254
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,501
Aye, sir?

255
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:09,506
- Come on.
- He's too tired.

256
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,633
- Why don't you do it by yourself?
- Yes.

257
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,676
- Why not?
- No.

258
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:17,472
- I will help.
- As you wish.

259
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:23,394
I've laid in
the reciprocal course back, captain.

260
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,821
Tell the captain I am ready,
first officer.

261
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,656
We're ready for you
to engage, captain.

262
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:40,370
- As before, begin at warp 1.5.
- Warp 1.5, sir.

263
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:00,348
This isn't working.

264
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:47,770
All stop.

265
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:50,565
Answering all stop, captain.

266
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,528
According to the instruments, sir,

267
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,239
our speed never exceeded
warp 1.5.

268
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,534
All stopped, sir.

269
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:03,703
Yes.

270
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:06,414
But where is this place?

271
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,046
Where none have gone before.

272
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:35,151
<i>Captain's log, stardate 41263.3.</i>

273
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:37,737
<i>Instead of returning
to our own galaxy,</i>

274
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:41,241
<i>the Enterprise has gone forward
to a place in the universe</i>

275
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:44,202
<i>which is uncharted and unknown.</i>

276
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:50,375
<i>Our present position puts us at over</i>
a <i>billion light years from our galaxy.</i>

277
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,669
Data, you have the helm.

278
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:55,171
I'll be in Engineering.

279
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:14,649
- What is it?
- A Klingon targ.

280
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:16,985
My Pet.

281
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,905
From home.

282
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:29,998
But when I was a child.

283
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:32,083
You're telling me it's a kitty cat?

284
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:35,461
Yes.

285
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:39,465
I suppose you could call it that.

286
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,052
You, darling.

287
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:26,554
What are you doing here?

288
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:37,398
Now run. This place isn't safe at all.

289
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:46,824
Tasha, what's wrong?
You look scared to death.

290
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:49,077
I was...

291
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:56,918
This is crazy.
I was at the colony where I grew up.

292
00:22:57,085 --> 00:23:00,630
- Being chased by a rape gang.
- Are you all right?

293
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:04,801
- Mm-hm.
- Well, you're safe now.

294
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:43,005
Captain, captain.
We need your help.

295
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:46,384
- What's wrong?
- Don't you see what's following us?

296
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:06,195
Ensign, what are you doing?

297
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:28,843
You look tense, Jean-Luc.

298
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,679
Come and have a cup of tea.

299
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:37,894
- Mama.
- I'll make it good and strong.

300
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,562
The way you like it.

301
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:41,772
Mama?

302
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:46,861
We'll have a nice long talk.

303
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:49,655
This can't be.

304
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,866
- You've been--
- Dead?

305
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:56,954
But I'm always with you.
You know that.

306
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,458
Yes.

307
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:03,252
I felt that.

308
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:07,673
- But why now? Suddenly?
- You mean out here?

309
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:13,763
At what you say
is the end of the universe?

310
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:18,518
Or do you see
this as the beginning of it?

311
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:21,479
We believe it the outer rim.

312
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:26,067
Mama, do you understand
these things?

313
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:31,739
Can you tell me where my ship is?
What is this place?

314
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:35,368
Captain?

315
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:37,912
- You were reported headed for--
- Just a moment, Number One.

316
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:10,027
Can I help you, sir?

317
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,156
No.

318
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:18,869
No, let's help all of us.

319
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,458
General quarters, red alert.

320
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:33,676
What is it, captain?
Why are we at general quarters?

321
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:37,096
I had to get everyone's attention.
This seemed to be the quickest way.

322
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:41,309
This is the captain.
This is not a drill.

323
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:44,145
It seems that in this place,

324
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:46,647
the world of the physical universe

325
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:51,027
and the world of ideas
is somehow intermixed.

326
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:55,072
What we think
also becomes a reality.

327
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,866
We <i>must,</i> therefore,

328
00:26:57,033 --> 00:27:00,620
<i>I repeat, must
begin controlling our thoughts</i>

329
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:04,790
<i>We will give you more on this
as our understanding increases.</i>

330
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:09,045
<i>The Enterprise will stay at full alert
until the crisis is over.</i>

331
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:12,632
- What did you do?
- It wasn't him, it never was.

332
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,842
- It was his assistant.
- What are you talking about?

333
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:17,178
Kosinski wasn't the one controlling
the warp experiment.

334
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:18,387
It was me.

335
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:20,640
The equations he punched in
were nonsense.

336
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:24,352
- Just as we thought.
- I honestly thought it was me.

337
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:26,520
I thought somehow...

338
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:29,482
Somehow, I was operating
on his level.

339
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:31,525
It was also my fault, captain.

340
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:34,195
I should have realized
it wasn't Kosinski.

341
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:37,948
How could you?
How could any of us?

342
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:40,576
Wesley did.

343
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:44,789
If you knew something,
why didn't you say so?

344
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:49,502
He tried, twice. I didn't listen.

345
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:54,465
- He's unconscious. Why?
- I'm not certain yet.

346
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:56,676
He phased, sir.

347
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:58,594
What does that mean?

348
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:02,348
Parts of him disappeared
and then came back.

349
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:05,267
Nobody else was paying attention
to him the first time.

350
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:07,478
When we saw it this time,
he seemed to be struggling.

351
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:08,688
Fighting it.

352
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,816
- He's dying.
- He mustn't.

353
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:13,859
He's the only one
who can get us back.

354
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:17,613
Realistically,
that doesn't seem possible.

355
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:25,371
<i>Captain's log, supplemental.</i>

356
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:27,707
<i>Our position is unknown</i>

357
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:32,586
<i>and our only chance of returning
to the known universe is a dying alien</i>

358
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:34,046
<i>who is generally humanoid</i>

359
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,674
<i>but with a physiology sufficiently
different from our own</i>

360
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:40,469
<i>to create medical problems
in caring for him.</i>

361
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:44,390
- Cause?
- I don't know.

362
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:47,685
My equipment doesn't register
his kind of life signs.

363
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:50,521
I would have to guess
exhaustion, fatigue.

364
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:54,525
- Is he gonna be all right?
- What is the boy doing here?

365
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:57,153
Mom, he's my friend.

366
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:58,988
You may want him here
before we're done.

367
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:03,367
He seems to have developed some
sort of special attachment to the boy.

368
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:05,035
My name is Wesley,
Commander Riker.

369
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:06,704
He knows.

370
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,748
We all know.

371
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:13,753
- Will he live?
- I'm not sure.

372
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:15,296
Wake him.

373
00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:17,465
I recommend we let him come around
in his own time.

374
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:19,175
I don't have that luxury.
Wake him.

375
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:22,428
He could die
and with him any chance we have.

376
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:25,514
Doctor, Wes,

377
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:28,058
we all have other friends
on board this ship.

378
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:29,351
If we stay here much longer,

379
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:32,855
we may lose the ability to distinguish
between thought and reality.

380
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:36,400
Now, regardless of the risk,
wake him, now.

381
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:03,803
Do you recognize me?
I'm the captain and I need answers.

382
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:09,642
I'll do my best to provide.

383
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:12,520
Who are you? Or what?

384
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:16,106
I am a traveler.

385
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:18,234
Traveler?

386
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,154
- What is your destination?
- Destination?

387
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:23,405
Yes.

388
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:26,742
- What place are you trying to reach?
- Ah, place, no.

389
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:29,912
There is no specific place
I wish to go.

390
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:32,414
Then what is the purpose
of your journey?

391
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:34,375
Curiosity.

392
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:37,837
- That's not an answer.
- I have certain abilities.

393
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:40,840
They give me a knowledge
of propulsion.

394
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:44,552
I've been trading this for passage
on Starfleet vessels.

395
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:47,054
And allowing Kosinski
to take credit for what you did?

396
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:49,014
It seemed the sensible way.

397
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,599
Until now.

398
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:54,103
Captain, I seek only transportation

399
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:58,023
in order to see and experience
your reality.

400
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:02,528
I am no threat to you,
your ship or your crew.

401
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:04,989
He isn't, captain. I know he isn't.

402
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,199
Our reality?

403
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,577
And in order to satisfy this curiosity,

404
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:13,372
you have brought my ship
and my crew into grave risk.

405
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:17,042
- I have made some mistakes.
- Some mistakes?

406
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:21,714
What mistakes could possibly explain
these incredible explosions of velocity?

407
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:28,554
I don't know if I can put this in terms
you'll understand.

408
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:32,474
I believe that there may be
a warp speed

409
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:36,562
that can get us
beyond Galaxy M33.

410
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:38,230
But there is no velocity

411
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:44,904
of any magnitude that can possibly
bring us wherever this is.

412
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:49,408
Is it true what our navigational senses
are telling us. Are we...?

413
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:52,202
Are we millions of light years
away from where we were?

414
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:57,333
- Yes.
- But what got us here?

415
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:58,792
- Thought.
- Thought?

416
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,920
You do understand, don't you,

417
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,963
that thought is the basis
of all reality?

418
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,425
The energy of thought,
to put it in your terms,

419
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:08,802
is very powerful.

420
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:10,721
That's not an explanation.

421
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:15,643
I have the ability to act like a lens
which focuses thought.

422
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:21,607
That's just, uh, so much nonsense.
You're asking us to believe in magic.

423
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,862
Oh, yes, this could seem like
magic to you.

424
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:28,405
No.

425
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:32,785
No. That actually
makes sense to me.

426
00:32:34,328 --> 00:32:36,830
Only the power of thought could
explain what has been happening,

427
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:38,207
especially out here.

428
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:42,503
Thought is the essence
of where you are now.

429
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:45,130
You do understand the danger,
don't you?

430
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,340
Chaos.

431
00:32:46,507 --> 00:32:47,800
What we think is what happens.

432
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:51,387
It pains me I was so careless,
captain.

433
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:55,474
My intent was only to observe,
not to cause this.

434
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:58,852
You should not be here
until your far, far distant future.

435
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:02,147
Certainly not
until you've learned control.

436
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,441
You are from a different time,
aren't you?

437
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,778
Oh, well, no, not exactly
from another time.

438
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:11,657
Although,
as you understand the concept,

439
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:15,119
yes, perhaps
that term fits as well as any.

440
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:18,414
- And you have this ability, to travel?
- Yes.

441
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,541
And others of your kind
have the same ability?

442
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:21,917
- Oh, yes.
- Then why,

443
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:23,919
in all of our history,
is there no record of you

444
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:26,672
or someone like you
ever having visited us?

445
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,549
What wonderful arrogance.

446
00:33:28,716 --> 00:33:32,386
There is no record because we have
not visited you before.

447
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:33,762
Why not?

448
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:36,598
Well, because up until now,

449
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:42,521
if you'll forgive this,
you've been uninteresting.

450
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:47,693
It's only now that your life-form merits
serious attention.

451
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:51,238
I'm sorry.

452
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:54,074
What's happening?

453
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:57,536
- He's unconscious again.
- Revive him.

454
00:33:57,703 --> 00:34:00,164
Whatever you need from him,
you better get it soon.

455
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,790
If I may suggest, sir,

456
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:05,961
our first leap out of our galaxy was,
as he said, a mistake.

457
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:07,963
Unless
he was distracted by something.

458
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,965
And it weakened him in some way,

459
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:12,259
resulting in the incredible
leap out here.

460
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:13,552
Theory.

461
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:16,346
Do you have any facts that fit this?

462
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:20,184
- Can you get us back?
- Wait, captain, not so fast.

463
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,978
We have an opportunity here
for scientific discovery.

464
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:26,899
And we report our observations how?
To whom?

465
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:33,614
- Can you get us back?
- I will try.

466
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:37,951
Number One, take him down
to Main Engineering.

467
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:40,788
- I'll be on the Bridge.
- No.

468
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:42,414
He's very weak.

469
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:45,167
The captain is right. We must hurry.

470
00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:51,298
But first, I request a moment
with the captain, alone.

471
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:11,944
Strange how he seems
to care for you.

472
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:14,363
He will forget me in time.

473
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:16,949
Which is as it should be.

474
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,409
It's Wesley
I wanted to speak to you about.

475
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:20,619
The boy?

476
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:22,830
It's best you do not repeat
this to the others,

477
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:24,540
especially not to the mother.

478
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:28,669
Whatever happens, it is imperative
that it proceed naturally.

479
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:31,505
I must get my ship back.
Do we have time for this?

480
00:35:31,672 --> 00:35:33,632
Oh, yes.

481
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:38,428
He and a few like him
are why I travel.

482
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:46,895
You have it in your power
to encourage him without interfering.

483
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:48,605
Encourage him in what?

484
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:50,816
How shall I explain?

485
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:54,486
Are you familiar with the intricacies
of what is called here music?

486
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:56,488
Somewhat.

487
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:59,658
And such musical genius as I saw
in one of your ship's libraries.

488
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:01,618
One called Mozart,

489
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:05,581
who as a small child
wrote astonishing symphonies.

490
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:11,086
A genius who made music
not only to be heard, but seen and felt,

491
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:14,506
beyond the understanding,
the ability of others.

492
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,592
Wesley is such a person.

493
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:18,302
Not with music,

494
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:23,307
but with the equally lovely intricacies
of time, energy, propulsion

495
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:29,104
and the instruments of this vessel,
which allow all that to be play--

496
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:31,982
You're right, I must hurry now.

497
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:35,194
But you're right in something else,
he is just a boy for now.

498
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:39,072
He should be encouraged,
but told none of this.

499
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:44,411
We've gotta get back home.
Take him to Main Engineering.

500
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:46,246
- Yes, sir.
- I'll be on the Bridge.

501
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:48,040
Yes, sir.

502
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,049
- Put it out!
- How?

503
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:58,759
Think!

504
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:01,178
Put the flame out in your thoughts!

505
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:15,609
Now, get to your station,
and concentrate on your assignment.

506
00:37:15,776 --> 00:37:16,902
Yes, sir.

507
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:26,370
<i>Captain's log.
Any time entry is meaningless.</i>

508
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:29,790
<i>We have no choice but to repeat
the same warp experiment,</i>

509
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:31,959
<i>but with one variation."</i>

510
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:34,795
<i>A principal part of this warp formula</i>

511
00:37:34,962 --> 00:37:38,257
<i>will be the thoughts
of everyone aboard the Enterprise.</i>

512
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:40,592
<i>We have no idea exactly
how this works.</i>

513
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:45,597
<i>We understand only that the Traveler
makes use of this somehow.</i>

514
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,599
<i>And it will be most important
that those aboard</i>

515
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:50,519
<i>avoid random thoughts
that might change the reality</i>

516
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:53,313
<i>of what we 're attempting to do.</i>

517
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:58,485
Do you have any further advice,
counselor?

518
00:37:58,652 --> 00:38:01,488
When you begin the attempt,
there will be stress.

519
00:38:01,655 --> 00:38:05,409
And it's only natural
the crew's concentration will shift.

520
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:08,537
Plus some genuine fear, captain.

521
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:10,330
You can't notice
what's happening outside

522
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:11,790
without feeling some of that.

523
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:16,545
All decks, all stations.

524
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:18,839
<i>This is the captain speaking.</i>

525
00:38:19,006 --> 00:38:21,049
<i>All decks,
I must have your full attention.</i>

526
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:24,219
<i>In a few moments,
as we attempt to warp back home,</i>

527
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:27,222
<i>it is vital, absolutely vital,</i>

528
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:30,559
<i>that you center your thoughts
on your duty</i>

529
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:33,770
<i>or on the welfare of the one called
the Traveler.</i>

530
00:38:34,438 --> 00:38:37,774
<i>Think of giving him
some of your strength.</i>

531
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:41,445
<i>Now, this is an order.
You must try to do this</i>

532
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:49,036
And now, attempt to concentrate
completely on your duty of the moment

533
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:53,040
or on the Traveler,
on his well-being.

534
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:58,462
<i>Think of
him as someone you care deeply for.</i>

535
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:03,425
All decks, all stations.

536
00:39:03,592 --> 00:39:05,052
Battle stations.

537
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:11,683
I will need Kosinski
back on the main computer.

538
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:15,729
You need me?

539
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:18,565
Yes.

540
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:28,492
Helm set in warp 1.5,
retroactive course.

541
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:30,535
Warp 1.5,

542
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:36,166
retroactive 261 mark 31, sir.

543
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,418
Bridge to Engineering, stand by.

544
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:43,340
I feel such an abundance
of well-being on the ship.

545
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:45,717
It feels like...

546
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:49,262
Quite wonderful.

547
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:53,225
<i>Engineering to Bridge, we're ready.</i>

548
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:56,561
On my order,
Mr. Data, Mr. La Forge,

549
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:02,943
engage.

550
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,767
It's not happening. It's not enough.

551
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,792
Warp 1.5, sir,

552
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:45,295
which is what my instruments
have read all along.

553
00:41:45,462 --> 00:41:47,214
And our position reads
exactly what it was

554
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,342
before this sleigh ride began, sir.

555
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:52,260
Cease red alert.

556
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:53,512
Sleigh ride?

557
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:57,766
Or whatever you wanna call it, Data.
I don't have a proper name for it.

558
00:41:58,183 --> 00:42:00,644
- The Traveler is gone, sir.
- Gone?

559
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:03,104
He's phased,
completely out of existence.

560
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:05,899
At least out of our existence.

561
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:10,737
Attention, all decks.

562
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:13,114
This is to inform you
that with your support,

563
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:16,743
the Traveler has returned us
to our own galaxy.

564
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:21,206
However, he has now left us,

565
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:26,169
wherever he has gone,
we wish him well.

566
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:29,965
Have the boy sent to the Bridge,
Number One.

567
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:33,927
Wesley Crusher, report to the Bridge.
On the double.

568
00:42:34,094 --> 00:42:35,595
Our next assignment
is on this heading?

569
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:37,264
Yes, sir.

570
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:40,600
Mr. Data, Mr. La Forge,
increase to warp 5, same heading.

571
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:44,521
- Warp 5, sir.
- On that same heading, sir.

572
00:42:44,688 --> 00:42:47,774
Oh, Wesley, come on the Bridge.

573
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:50,068
Move.

574
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:54,656
Commander Riker has told me

575
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:57,117
how supportive you were
in Engineering. Well done.

576
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:59,244
Oh, at ease.

577
00:42:59,411 --> 00:43:03,582
- Uh, sit here, in command.
- Captain, it's not allowed.

578
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:05,625
Your orders.

579
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:07,294
Oh, that's true.

580
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:13,300
Well, uh,
I, uh, can't waive them again.

581
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:16,428
Only commissioned officers?

582
00:43:16,595 --> 00:43:18,346
It's quite all right, sir. I understand.

583
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:22,767
- Please don't interrupt me, Wesley.
- I'm sorry, sir.

584
00:43:25,145 --> 00:43:28,773
Any commission rank?
Even ensign?

585
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,359
That would give him
authorized access to the Bridge.

586
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:36,573
Well, then, I'll have
to make him an acting ensign.

587
00:43:38,408 --> 00:43:43,997
Captain's log, stardate 41263.4.

588
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:47,500
For outstanding performance
in the best Starfleet tradition,

589
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:49,586
Wesley Crusher
is made acting ensign,

590
00:43:49,753 --> 00:43:52,756
with the duties
and privileges of that rank.

591
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:56,593
And whether that rank
becomes permanent, Mr. Crusher,

592
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,553
depends on you.

593
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,930
At the earliest opportunity,
your entrance application

594
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:03,808
for Starfleet Academy
will be tendered.

595
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:07,896
Until then, you will learn this ship.
Every operation, every function.

596
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:11,399
Commander Riker,
a duty schedule for Mr. Crusher.

597
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:14,361
- Heavy on study.
- Aye, sir.

598
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:17,447
Meanwhile, you can sit here
and learn something.

599
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:24,788
Sir, shall I send for Dr. Crusher?

600
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:25,997
Why? Is someone ill?

601
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:29,334
Or would you rather
tell her about this, Wes?

602
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:32,712
If you don't mind, sir,
I'd like to sit here for a while.

603
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:34,047
I'll tell her later.
