1
00:00:05,304 --> 00:00:08,136
Dad, why do those people
get better seats than us?

2
00:00:08,137 --> 00:00:09,833
Your Honor,
it's not that I...

3
00:00:09,834 --> 00:00:14,606
Shawn, those people aren't just watching
the trial. Those people are the trial.

4
00:00:14,607 --> 00:00:16,168
They're the jurors,

5
00:00:16,169 --> 00:00:18,510
and they're the most
important people in this room.

6
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:19,675
They are?

7
00:00:19,676 --> 00:00:22,275
The thing about
the jury is, Shawn,

8
00:00:22,276 --> 00:00:25,378
you gotta learn how to look
at them, how to read them.

9
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:29,516
For instance, take a look
at juror number five.

10
00:00:29,517 --> 00:00:32,084
He's the guy in the front row,
second one from the left.

11
00:00:32,085 --> 00:00:34,653
Tell me what you see. Go.

12
00:00:36,434 --> 00:00:38,924
Brown shirt,
little hole in his collar.

13
00:00:38,925 --> 00:00:40,697
His coat is too tight on him.

14
00:00:40,698 --> 00:00:44,866
He's got rough hands, he's looking
down mostly and nodding a lot.

15
00:00:45,443 --> 00:00:46,430
Good, good.

16
00:00:46,431 --> 00:00:48,534
All right, let's take
that hole in his collar.

17
00:00:48,535 --> 00:00:51,079
Now, would Mom ever let you leave
the house looking like that?

18
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,205
Never.

19
00:00:52,206 --> 00:00:53,373
You believe it.

20
00:00:53,374 --> 00:00:57,112
So, that tells us that
he's probably not married.

21
00:00:57,113 --> 00:00:59,416
That's called
deductive reasoning.

22
00:00:59,417 --> 00:01:03,652
Your Honor, the people call
Detective Henry L. Spencer to the stand.

23
00:01:03,653 --> 00:01:06,126
All right, watch closely, kid.

24
00:01:06,127 --> 00:01:08,126
One day you're gonna walk up
the steps of this courthouse

25
00:01:08,127 --> 00:01:10,722
and you're gonna make
your old man proud.

26
00:01:10,934 --> 00:01:12,923
Gus, they impounded
my motorcycle without warning.

27
00:01:12,924 --> 00:01:15,971
I'm pretty sure the warning was the $900
worth of parking tickets you racked up.

28
00:01:15,972 --> 00:01:18,267
Still, man, you can't take a man's
means of transportation away.

29
00:01:18,268 --> 00:01:19,567
It's, like, unconstitutional
or something.

30
00:01:19,568 --> 00:01:20,972
I'm pretty sure
it's not in the Constitution.

31
00:01:20,973 --> 00:01:22,202
Oh, don't be so sure.

32
00:01:22,203 --> 00:01:25,246
I think it says, "Thou shalt not
something, or covet something.

33
00:01:25,247 --> 00:01:28,111
"Don't mess with Texas or
the right of transportation."

34
00:01:28,112 --> 00:01:29,207
You're thinking
of a commandment.

35
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,648
That's even better.
Can we just pay this ticket

36
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:31,946
so we can get out
of here, please?

37
00:01:31,947 --> 00:01:33,988
You gotta be kidding me.
We came all the way over here,

38
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:35,385
and now you're not
gonna wait in the line?

39
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,390
Gus, did you see it in there?
It's a ticket payment line,

40
00:01:37,391 --> 00:01:39,049
not Space Mountain.
Hardly worth it.

41
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,390
Plus, I don't wait in lines. What
do you mean you don't wait in lines?

42
00:01:41,391 --> 00:01:44,589
Everyone waits in lines. That's what
we do as people, we wait in lines.

43
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,394
I don't.
It's not in my nature.

44
00:01:46,395 --> 00:01:47,990
That makes no sense, Shawn.

45
00:01:47,991 --> 00:01:49,695
You remember the story
of the scorpion and the frog?

46
00:01:49,696 --> 00:01:53,730
Burton Guster. They're both on
the riverbank. The scorpion's like, "Hey"...

47
00:02:07,889 --> 00:02:10,412
The point is I shouldn't
have gotten any tickets, Gus.

48
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:12,423
I was using
my ambassador plates.

49
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,891
Ambassador plates? You're
not an ambassador, Shawn.

50
00:02:14,892 --> 00:02:16,895
Impersonating a government
official will land you in jail.

51
00:02:16,896 --> 00:02:19,227
I am an ambassador,
of sorts.

52
00:02:19,228 --> 00:02:22,631
I am a goodwill ambassador
to Paraguay.

53
00:02:24,171 --> 00:02:26,195
To where?
Paraguay.

54
00:02:26,196 --> 00:02:27,899
It is an honorary title
that I received

55
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,967
after overseeing all sand castle
construction at a South American Club Med.

56
00:02:32,178 --> 00:02:33,338
You never worked at Club Med.

57
00:02:33,339 --> 00:02:34,605
Ooh, turn that up.

58
00:02:34,606 --> 00:02:36,909
<i>Someone we know,
someone we love,</i>

59
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,177
<i>someone we invited into our...</i>

60
00:02:38,178 --> 00:02:40,047
I just saw that woman
at the courthouse.

61
00:02:40,048 --> 00:02:43,052
That's Sandra Panitch, the fourth grade
teacher who murdered Jackson Hale.

62
00:02:43,053 --> 00:02:45,782
Don't you watch the news? I
can't watch Channel 8 anymore.

63
00:02:45,783 --> 00:02:48,826
Lloyd Lansing wears a toupee. It's
like every newscast starts with a lie.

64
00:02:48,827 --> 00:02:52,293
I can't stand this guy. Something
about him just irks me. Listen to him.

65
00:02:52,294 --> 00:02:58,165
<i>Sandra Panitch went with weatherman
Jackson Hale to his Channel 8 news studio,</i>

66
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,362
<i>engaged in sexual relations
with him,</i>

67
00:03:00,363 --> 00:03:03,372
<i>and then stabbed him in the
heart with a letter opener.</i>

68
00:03:03,373 --> 00:03:06,739
<i>She fled the scene,
but not without leaving behind</i>

69
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,573
<i>a mountain
of physical evidence,</i>

70
00:03:08,574 --> 00:03:10,637
<i>including a trail
of the victim's blood,</i>

71
00:03:10,638 --> 00:03:13,705
<i>and her fingerprints
all over the murder weapon.</i>

72
00:03:13,706 --> 00:03:16,811
<i>This is why the state
is going after murder one.</i>

73
00:03:17,355 --> 00:03:18,547
But she didn't do it!
What?

74
00:03:18,548 --> 00:03:20,612
Gus, I'm getting
a very strong feeling here.

75
00:03:20,613 --> 00:03:22,090
I think that woman
is innocent.

76
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:24,491
I do watch the news, and
I've been following this case.

77
00:03:24,492 --> 00:03:26,585
They have a mountain
of evidence against this lady.

78
00:03:26,586 --> 00:03:28,255
Look, they call her
the "School Marm Murderer."

79
00:03:28,256 --> 00:03:30,925
Okay, first of all, there's a
question mark at the end of that.

80
00:03:30,926 --> 00:03:33,901
They call her the
"School Marm Murderer?"

81
00:03:33,902 --> 00:03:35,562
Even the news people
aren't convinced.

82
00:03:35,563 --> 00:03:38,505
And today at the courthouse,
in the middle of a conversation,

83
00:03:38,506 --> 00:03:41,474
I saw her bend over
and pick up a piece of trash!

84
00:03:41,475 --> 00:03:44,376
Oh, I see. So because she picks
up somebody's KitKat wrapper

85
00:03:44,377 --> 00:03:46,937
means she didn't kill anybody?
That makes sense.

86
00:03:46,938 --> 00:03:49,415
Gus, she didn't
have to do that.

87
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,543
The woman is about to be
on trial for her life.

88
00:03:51,544 --> 00:03:53,383
She takes time out
for common courtesy?

89
00:03:53,384 --> 00:03:57,152
That is not the mindset of
a cold-blooded murderer. No!

90
00:03:57,153 --> 00:04:01,423
This is what I know. She
looked at me right in the eyes.

91
00:04:01,424 --> 00:04:05,090
Now, there are a lot of tells
that people have

92
00:04:05,091 --> 00:04:07,361
when they are trying
to appear not guilty.

93
00:04:07,362 --> 00:04:10,233
The way that they sit, crossing
their legs, uncrossing them,

94
00:04:10,234 --> 00:04:14,570
crossing them back, eye lines to inanimate
objects, twitching, itching, rubbing.

95
00:04:14,571 --> 00:04:17,941
All of these affectations,
I am an expert on all of them.

96
00:04:17,942 --> 00:04:23,006
But there is one thing that you cannot
change no matter how hard you try,

97
00:04:23,007 --> 00:04:27,749
and that is the tent
on the windows to the soul.

98
00:04:32,494 --> 00:04:35,121
<i>Adam Hornstock,
attorney for the defense.</i>

99
00:04:35,863 --> 00:04:39,662
<i>Sandra Panitch
is a victim of circumstance,</i>

100
00:04:39,663 --> 00:04:42,099
<i>of being in the wrong place
at the wrong time.</i>

101
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,363
I know.
Look at this poor guy.

102
00:04:44,364 --> 00:04:46,905
Look, he's hunched over,
he's not making eye contact.

103
00:04:46,906 --> 00:04:49,168
Look at the handkerchief
in the left pocket, there.

104
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:51,436
It's not decorative, Gus.
That's crumpled and stained.

105
00:04:51,437 --> 00:04:54,913
That's used for
dabbing sweat, a lot.

106
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,678
Her lawyer's a beaten man.

107
00:04:57,679 --> 00:05:02,655
Whether he knows it or not,
Adam Hornstock needs us.

108
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:05,257
What are you talking about?

109
00:05:05,258 --> 00:05:08,817
Dude, we're going to be
legal consultants.

110
00:05:10,463 --> 00:05:11,930
It's awesome.

111
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:20,536
<i>I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth</i>

112
00:05:20,537 --> 00:05:23,769
<i>I know, you know
They just don't have any proof</i>

113
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:27,004
<i>Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend</i>

114
00:05:27,005 --> 00:05:31,072
<i>Your worst inhibitions tend
to psych you out in the end</i>

115
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,089
Ooh, let's get in there
and grab seats.

116
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,993
How? You think that court officer
is guarding the door for his health?

117
00:05:44,994 --> 00:05:46,393
Just roll with me on this.

118
00:05:46,394 --> 00:05:47,896
Excuse me, people.
Coming through!

119
00:05:47,897 --> 00:05:51,799
Shawn Spencer here. Spencer.
That's S-P-E-N-C-E-R.

120
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,531
This is my partner,
Burton Guster. G-U...

121
00:05:55,006 --> 00:05:57,235
Look, I know I've been
reluctant to go on record

122
00:05:57,236 --> 00:05:58,900
about this trial
up to this point...

123
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm sorry, who are you?

124
00:06:01,001 --> 00:06:02,374
What is this,
Journalism 101?

125
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:05,176
I give my statement, you berate me
with your rudimentary Q and A later.

126
00:06:05,177 --> 00:06:07,478
In fact, you two
switch places.

127
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:08,916
Come here. Excuse me.
Come on, don't be shy.

128
00:06:08,917 --> 00:06:10,714
He puts his pants on
one leg at a time. I do.

129
00:06:10,715 --> 00:06:13,550
As I was saying, this trial
is not about a particular case.

130
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:15,647
It is about our rights
as citizens.

131
00:06:15,648 --> 00:06:20,491
No one, and I mean no one, should ever
wake up and I don't know, let's say,

132
00:06:20,492 --> 00:06:23,327
find that their motorcycle
has been taken away from them.

133
00:06:23,328 --> 00:06:26,334
As this trial moves forward, I'll have
more to say. That is all. Thank you.

134
00:06:26,335 --> 00:06:29,064
Motorcycle? Whose motorcycle are
we talking about here? Did...

135
00:06:29,065 --> 00:06:31,834
Guys, please. Please,
give them space. Please.

136
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,774
Are we ready yet,
Mr. Hornstock?

137
00:06:34,775 --> 00:06:39,144
Oh, yes.
Just one moment, sir. Ah!

138
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,106
You know, I was pre-law once.
Maybe I should have stuck with it.

139
00:06:44,107 --> 00:06:47,211
You were never pre-law.
Well, I was pre-pre-law.

140
00:06:47,212 --> 00:06:50,019
Sixth grade, but it was
an accelerated program.

141
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,649
<i>I won a mock trial of
Tortoise v. Hare, you know.</i>

142
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,820
The hare did it.
Of course he did.

143
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:03,230
The court will take a short
recess, and then perhaps,

144
00:07:03,231 --> 00:07:06,502
Mr. Hornstock, we can get
going with these proceedings.

145
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,840
Dude, we're so hired.
We are?

146
00:07:10,746 --> 00:07:12,645
Watch this.

147
00:07:14,749 --> 00:07:18,207
Excuse me, Mr.
Hornstock? Right?

148
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,582
You don't know me.
My name's Shawn Spencer.

149
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:22,144
I'm the lead psychic detective
at the SBPD.

150
00:07:22,145 --> 00:07:24,086
Yeah, I'm a little busy
right now.

151
00:07:24,087 --> 00:07:26,455
I can see. You're doing a
bang up job. Please don't stop.

152
00:07:26,456 --> 00:07:30,088
I just... I think maybe you
should be a little careful.

153
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:32,222
Of?
Juror number four.

154
00:07:32,223 --> 00:07:34,597
Juror... Oh, yeah?
Why is that?

155
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:37,899
Something about you
really bothers her.

156
00:07:38,605 --> 00:07:39,901
And something about her
bothers me.

157
00:07:39,902 --> 00:07:41,997
I mean, she's been frowning
at me the whole time,

158
00:07:41,998 --> 00:07:43,098
and I haven't even
gone up yet.

159
00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:45,040
Here's the thing.
She's a fashion maven.

160
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,271
She has a problem
with your appearance,

161
00:07:46,272 --> 00:07:49,143
and until you change it, I don't think
she's gonna listen to a word you say.

162
00:07:49,144 --> 00:07:51,239
My appearance? The manner
in which you appear.

163
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,306
Your look.

164
00:07:52,307 --> 00:07:54,580
I don't know exactly what the
problem is, but let's check it out.

165
00:07:54,581 --> 00:07:56,885
Why don't you give me the... Give
me the 360 cat dance real fast, huh?

166
00:07:57,981 --> 00:08:01,253
Excuse me? Just twirl it up for
me, and then twirl it right back.

167
00:08:01,254 --> 00:08:03,317
There it is. And back.

168
00:08:03,318 --> 00:08:06,558
Suit, pleated. I would have
gone with a three button,

169
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:07,620
maybe something
in a wool-cotton blend,

170
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:08,893
but I don't think
that's the problem.

171
00:08:08,894 --> 00:08:12,266
Sideburns? Check. Hair,
bold, Strokes, Hives.

172
00:08:12,267 --> 00:08:13,531
I don't think
that's the problem.

173
00:08:13,532 --> 00:08:16,073
The shoes, not a spit shine, but like
you said, you haven't gotten up yet,

174
00:08:16,074 --> 00:08:18,666
so I can't make
heads or... Whoa!

175
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:20,472
What?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

176
00:08:20,473 --> 00:08:22,604
I think it's the tie.
What? My tie?

177
00:08:22,605 --> 00:08:25,674
What's wrong with my tie?
Well, it's a little bit...

178
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:32,453
Well, look, it's not
like my favorite tie...

179
00:08:32,454 --> 00:08:34,150
I'm so glad to
hear you say that.

180
00:08:34,151 --> 00:08:35,214
Gus?
What?

181
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,260
Quick, give me your
tie. I'm not giving you my tie.

182
00:08:37,261 --> 00:08:38,352
It's a good tie!
Give me your tie, please.

183
00:08:38,353 --> 00:08:41,455
It's a Thomas Pink tie.
One second.

184
00:08:41,456 --> 00:08:44,032
Why don't you give me the
tie? Just once will you...

185
00:08:44,033 --> 00:08:46,161
Come on, Shawn!

186
00:08:47,605 --> 00:08:49,402
Look high, reach low.
Got it.

187
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:51,338
Now, we're also
going to take this.

188
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:53,433
Primarily because
it's covered in sweat,

189
00:08:53,434 --> 00:08:55,740
but also because it reads
cruise ship waiter to me.

190
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:57,906
Cruise ship?
Go get 'em!

191
00:09:01,619 --> 00:09:03,779
And so, I will demonstrate
to the court

192
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:08,119
that Sandra Panitch is an upstanding
citizen with no criminal record,

193
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,788
and the district attorney has rushed
to the prosecution of an innocent woman.

194
00:09:15,032 --> 00:09:17,897
Are you finished now,
Mr. Hornstock?

195
00:09:17,898 --> 00:09:20,492
Hmm? Ah! Oh, yes.
Yes, Your Honor.

196
00:09:21,137 --> 00:09:22,228
Brilliant.

197
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,634
Well, things are
finally moving along.

198
00:09:24,635 --> 00:09:26,971
Court will recess
till after lunch.

199
00:09:30,013 --> 00:09:32,378
Did you see that? That was
amazing! Did you see that?

200
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:33,471
That was a whole 180!

201
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:34,742
Well, it's a pretty
amazing tie.

202
00:09:34,743 --> 00:09:38,218
Hey, strong shag, strong
tie, strong person.

203
00:09:38,987 --> 00:09:43,253
You know, guys, I would hire
you in a second. It's just...

204
00:09:43,659 --> 00:09:45,888
Well, I, I don't
have the authorization.

205
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:48,827
My firm doesn't really
believe in...

206
00:09:48,828 --> 00:09:50,523
Winning?
No.

207
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:51,826
Mermaids?
No.

208
00:09:51,827 --> 00:09:54,060
The Minotaur?
No, me.

209
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:56,433
Yeah, at least not anymore.

210
00:09:56,434 --> 00:09:57,664
No, there's no buts here.

211
00:09:57,665 --> 00:10:00,366
A lot of the cases my partner
Gus and I take, we do for free.

212
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:01,806
<i>It's called pro bono.</i>

213
00:10:01,807 --> 00:10:02,968
Gus?
What?

214
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:05,842
A little decorum,
we're in a courtroom.

215
00:10:05,843 --> 00:10:09,906
Congratulations, you got yourself
a couple of legal consultants.

216
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,780
Wow.
Oh, boy.

217
00:10:14,255 --> 00:10:16,222
Did he just grab your fist?
And then he shook it.

218
00:10:16,223 --> 00:10:19,224
Well, well, well,
what do we have here?

219
00:10:19,225 --> 00:10:20,350
Hi, Jules.

220
00:10:20,351 --> 00:10:22,588
Please tell me you're not one
of those courtroom groupies

221
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:24,857
that bounces
from trial to trial?

222
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:27,797
Wait a second, was that you
at the Michael Jackson hearing

223
00:10:27,798 --> 00:10:29,698
with the sequined glove
and the shirt that said,

224
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:32,259
"Please free the man
in the mirror"?

225
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,896
That's actually
really funny, Shawn.

226
00:10:33,897 --> 00:10:38,068
Detective Lassiter is the one who
actually made the arrest of Sandra Panitch.

227
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:39,872
See, that makes it my case.

228
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:42,880
What a coincidence.
It's also our case.

229
00:10:42,881 --> 00:10:46,577
Yeah, we just signed on as legal
consultants to the defense just now.

230
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:51,111
And you will sell your little sideshow
act to anyone who'll listen, won't you?

231
00:10:51,112 --> 00:10:53,454
Just don't screw this one up.

232
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,851
"Don't screw this up"?

233
00:10:57,564 --> 00:11:00,429
Hey, Lassy, that really
wasn't much of a put down.

234
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:03,764
In fact it was
somewhat inspiring.

235
00:11:04,637 --> 00:11:06,696
Las, let's roll that back!

236
00:11:10,909 --> 00:11:13,605
I don't know.
It feels a little weird.

237
00:11:14,012 --> 00:11:16,672
I mean, you should really be
sitting here. This is your office.

238
00:11:16,673 --> 00:11:18,716
Yeah, this isn't my office.

239
00:11:18,717 --> 00:11:22,514
You didn't like mine. This is Carter
Jarecki's office, one of the partners.

240
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,715
Actually, he's the guy who took
the case in the first place,

241
00:11:25,716 --> 00:11:28,815
but then dumped it on me when
he decided it was a lost cause.

242
00:11:28,816 --> 00:11:30,917
You see, that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

243
00:11:30,918 --> 00:11:32,724
Why didn't you stand up
to that guy?

244
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:36,562
For the worst reason possible. I
actually believe this woman is innocent.

245
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:39,797
Now, can we please
go before Jarecki gets back?

246
00:11:42,273 --> 00:11:47,232
Carter Jarecki just left for a nooner with
his mistress. We have at least two hours.

247
00:11:51,815 --> 00:11:53,407
Maybe an hour and a half.

248
00:11:53,408 --> 00:11:56,451
Hornstock, I think you have the
potential to be a fantastic lawyer.

249
00:11:56,452 --> 00:12:00,250
You just need confidence. After all,
that's your name on the door. Now come on!

250
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:03,758
Oh, no. No. None of those
Hornstocks are me.

251
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:07,455
The first one is my
grandfather, he founded the firm.

252
00:12:07,456 --> 00:12:10,897
The other one is my father,
then my brother.

253
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:12,796
Wow. A whole
family of lawyers?

254
00:12:12,797 --> 00:12:14,802
Yeah, even my sister.

255
00:12:14,803 --> 00:12:17,463
Well, there you go.
She didn't make the door.

256
00:12:17,464 --> 00:12:20,475
She's Biederman.
It's her married name.

257
00:12:22,344 --> 00:12:24,368
Well, we're gonna need to take
a look at your witness list

258
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,878
and your deposition
transcripts.

259
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:28,211
Oh, yeah. Well, I prepared
all that for you.

260
00:12:28,212 --> 00:12:31,719
I have... Here are all the
forensic and arrest reports.

261
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,552
And I deposed several of
Hale's coworkers from Channel 8,

262
00:12:35,553 --> 00:12:39,058
mostly to refute timelines
and for character testimony.

263
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,253
Can we see those?

264
00:12:40,254 --> 00:12:42,320
Oh, sure, yeah. It's...

265
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:46,864
Oh, yes.

266
00:12:46,865 --> 00:12:49,870
And maybe, later on we can read
the phonebook, just for fun.

267
00:12:49,871 --> 00:12:54,238
Hornstock, I've gotta do
what I do.

268
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,235
That's not the way I do it.

269
00:12:56,236 --> 00:12:59,472
I need to see,
feel and smell people

270
00:12:59,473 --> 00:13:01,707
in order to figure out
what happens.

271
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:03,178
Smell them?

272
00:13:05,186 --> 00:13:08,950
So, this is where the...
The crime took place.

273
00:13:08,951 --> 00:13:10,956
So, just feel free
to have a look around,

274
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,890
and do whatever it is
you do.

275
00:13:13,891 --> 00:13:15,395
Okay.
Thank you.

276
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,732
Let's walk the
crime, shall we? Yeah.

277
00:13:21,733 --> 00:13:24,702
He probably came in from that
same entrance we did. Right.

278
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:29,866
Found their way over here to
the Channel 8 anchor desk area.

279
00:13:29,867 --> 00:13:33,743
Of course, the body
was found here.

280
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,944
It was a short walk.
Yeah.

281
00:13:36,945 --> 00:13:39,347
Priscilla, what are these
green walls for?

282
00:13:39,348 --> 00:13:41,181
Oh, well we do it all
on green screen.

283
00:13:41,182 --> 00:13:43,654
Really? Can you show me
how that works, please?

284
00:13:43,655 --> 00:13:46,418
Sure, I just need someone
to sit in front.

285
00:13:46,419 --> 00:13:47,958
Gus, go sit over there.

286
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:50,858
I'm not going to sit there just
'cause you tell me to, Shawn.

287
00:13:50,859 --> 00:13:52,920
Fine, I'll...
I'll play anchorman.

288
00:13:52,921 --> 00:13:54,796
I got it. I got it.

289
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:02,999
Okay, so we've just have to go to
the control room. It's just this way.

290
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,133
Okay.

291
00:14:06,074 --> 00:14:07,940
You know when we're watching
the weather guy,

292
00:14:07,941 --> 00:14:10,674
and it looks like he's got,
like, rainfall behind him? Yeah.

293
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:12,306
Or snow or hail?
Yeah.

294
00:14:12,307 --> 00:14:14,145
How does that work? Well,
the green background works

295
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:17,188
as a blank slate. Then I
just run it through the board

296
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:19,450
and presto!

297
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:22,223
A composite of the
two images is made.

298
00:14:22,224 --> 00:14:23,759
Oh, oh! Can we
get sound in here?

299
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,318
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

300
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,521
<i>In local news,</i>

301
00:14:27,522 --> 00:14:29,725
<i>a pharmaceutical
representative again provided</i>

302
00:14:29,726 --> 00:14:33,098
<i>the key piece of information
in a baffling police case.</i>

303
00:14:33,099 --> 00:14:35,103
But ran screaming
from the scene,

304
00:14:35,104 --> 00:14:38,231
like a little girl before
he could make a statement.

305
00:14:38,232 --> 00:14:40,936
That was one time, Shawn! One
time! I don't like dead bodies!

306
00:14:40,937 --> 00:14:43,536
I told you that.
Now stop bringing that up!

307
00:14:45,282 --> 00:14:47,978
Hello, this is
your local news.

308
00:14:49,719 --> 00:14:51,481
This next office
was Jackson Hale's.

309
00:14:51,482 --> 00:14:53,579
I've got to tell you guys,
everybody's been acting a little weird

310
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,123
since it happened.
It's just not the same.

311
00:14:56,124 --> 00:15:00,559
Oh! Ruben, this is Shawn
Spencer and Burton Guster.

312
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,494
They're working
on Jackson Hale's case.

313
00:15:02,495 --> 00:15:05,464
This is Ruben Leonard, he's a lab
meteorologist on Jackson's team.

314
00:15:05,465 --> 00:15:06,661
Was.

315
00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:10,761
I was just sorting and packing

316
00:15:10,762 --> 00:15:14,775
some of his more important
things to send to his family.

317
00:15:15,177 --> 00:15:16,439
It's the least I can do.

318
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,602
That's very thoughtful.

319
00:15:17,603 --> 00:15:18,737
Thank you.

320
00:15:18,738 --> 00:15:20,872
<i>That reminds me of a hot,
little señorita I met there.</i>

321
00:15:20,873 --> 00:15:22,415
<i>She was serving
fried jalapenos...</i>

322
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,712
Would you excuse me?
Sure.

323
00:15:23,713 --> 00:15:24,945
Sure.
Thanks.

324
00:15:26,422 --> 00:15:27,944
<i>So,
if you'll notice that...</i>

325
00:15:27,945 --> 00:15:29,182
Did you work
with Jackson Hale long?

326
00:15:29,183 --> 00:15:32,454
Six years. He was a great man.

327
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:35,987
I had a lot
of respect for him.

328
00:15:40,568 --> 00:15:42,195
He was just so good
at what he did.

329
00:15:42,196 --> 00:15:44,066
<i>Take your umbrella
because I guarantee,</i>

330
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:46,698
<i>it's raining cats and dogs
out there.</i>

331
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:48,571
A broadcasting treasure.

332
00:15:49,711 --> 00:15:52,804
<i>Anyway, take a look
at Thursday here...</i>

333
00:15:56,617 --> 00:15:58,107
Dude,

334
00:15:59,386 --> 00:16:01,478
Ruben's in there
destroying Hale's awards.

335
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:02,612
What?
Yeah.

336
00:16:02,613 --> 00:16:05,487
Unless he's really offended by the
shoddy engraving on the plaque,

337
00:16:05,488 --> 00:16:11,394
that guy hates Jackson Hale. I'm not saying
he did it, but reasonable doubt, anyone?

338
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:20,330
Okay, Miss Panitch. Please, walk
us through the night of the crime.

339
00:16:21,074 --> 00:16:24,634
Well, I never met Mr. Hale
before that night.

340
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:26,940
I just moved here
from Wisconsin.

341
00:16:26,941 --> 00:16:28,411
It wasn't like
I was a fan of his.

342
00:16:28,412 --> 00:16:31,041
I only vaguely knew
he was a weatherman.

343
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:34,275
So we talked,
and he was charming...

344
00:16:34,276 --> 00:16:35,877
So the scratches
on Jackson Hale's back

345
00:16:35,878 --> 00:16:37,545
and his skin under
your the fingernails,

346
00:16:37,546 --> 00:16:39,351
this all happened
during the sex,

347
00:16:39,352 --> 00:16:41,358
as well as the bruises
on your arm?

348
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:43,553
It got passionate.

349
00:16:43,554 --> 00:16:46,358
I don't remember anything until
I woke up the next morning.

350
00:16:46,359 --> 00:16:47,693
With his blood on you?

351
00:16:47,694 --> 00:16:49,130
And then you fled
to the parking lot?

352
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:51,430
Look, I was scared.

353
00:16:51,431 --> 00:16:55,232
I, I know how bad
all of this looks, I do.

354
00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:59,265
But I swear
I did not murder anyone.

355
00:16:59,266 --> 00:17:02,505
Do you guys believe me?
Do you?

356
00:17:02,506 --> 00:17:05,240
Of course we do, Sandra.
Don't be ridiculous.

357
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:06,613
Counselor?
Yes?

358
00:17:06,614 --> 00:17:08,275
Would you please retire
with me to the hallway,

359
00:17:08,276 --> 00:17:11,287
where we can exchange words
in hushed tones?

360
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,785
Okay, what are you doing?
What?

361
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:18,986
You are supposed to be demonstrating
confidence and swagger for Hornstock.

362
00:17:18,987 --> 00:17:21,621
Instead you're poking holes in our
case, and you're scaring our defendant.

363
00:17:21,622 --> 00:17:24,758
Here are the facts, Shawn. All we know
about Sandra is what she's told us.

364
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:26,495
I think we need
to do some investigating.

365
00:17:26,496 --> 00:17:28,867
I believe her. Hornstock believes
her. What else do we need?

366
00:17:28,868 --> 00:17:30,428
We need proof, Shawn.

367
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:31,905
Look, right here in this book?

368
00:17:31,906 --> 00:17:36,968
<i>Corey v. Bulevic in 1955. The key piece
of evidence were half-melted candlesticks.</i>

369
00:17:36,969 --> 00:17:39,412
We need evidence! Where are
our candlesticks, Shawn?

370
00:17:39,413 --> 00:17:40,813
Maybe you just
jumped over them?

371
00:17:40,814 --> 00:17:42,908
What?
Be nimble. Be quick.

372
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:44,508
You're not going to give me
anything for that?

373
00:17:44,509 --> 00:17:46,146
Now can we please...

374
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:51,653
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Check out the judge.

375
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,921
He's grabbing his back.
No wonder he's so grumpy.

376
00:17:53,922 --> 00:17:56,088
He's not grabbing his back,
he's grabbing his kidneys.

377
00:17:56,089 --> 00:17:58,100
He probably
has a kidney stone.

378
00:17:58,968 --> 00:18:00,527
Dude, nice!
Thank you.

379
00:18:01,103 --> 00:18:05,061
Please state to the court what
your relationship with Mr. Hale was.

380
00:18:05,062 --> 00:18:08,702
It was professional. He was my
boss. I was his receptionist.

381
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:12,235
And as the Channel 8
receptionist, Miss Osterman,

382
00:18:12,236 --> 00:18:16,682
if people were to call Jackson
Hale, you took those calls?

383
00:18:16,683 --> 00:18:17,739
I did.

384
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,949
And did you receive any calls from the
defendant, Sandra Panitch, at any time?

385
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,513
Oh, not to my knowledge. No.

386
00:18:24,514 --> 00:18:26,491
But other women would call?

387
00:18:26,492 --> 00:18:27,652
Sure.

388
00:18:27,653 --> 00:18:30,094
Was Jackson Hale
sleeping with these women?

389
00:18:30,095 --> 00:18:32,325
Objection, Your Honor,
hearsay.

390
00:18:32,326 --> 00:18:33,864
I'll allow the question.

391
00:18:33,865 --> 00:18:36,903
Well, I can only say that
I fielded many calls,

392
00:18:36,904 --> 00:18:40,167
and sometimes I helped
to juggle these calls.

393
00:18:40,168 --> 00:18:41,639
He was a handsome man.

394
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,699
He certainly was.

395
00:18:46,848 --> 00:18:48,905
Thank you, Miss Osterman.

396
00:18:48,906 --> 00:18:51,211
You may
step down, Miss Osterman.

397
00:18:51,212 --> 00:18:52,274
Thanks.

398
00:18:52,653 --> 00:18:57,021
Your Honor, the state requests a
moment to prepare for our next witness.

399
00:18:57,022 --> 00:18:59,319
"He certainly was"? What
happened? You were rolling!

400
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,088
I don't know, I don't know,
it sounded good in my head.

401
00:19:02,089 --> 00:19:03,821
You have a great
support system, you know,

402
00:19:03,822 --> 00:19:04,920
it gives you
that easy confidence.

403
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:06,964
But, you know, my father hasn't
been in the courtroom once.

404
00:19:06,965 --> 00:19:08,057
Not one of my trials.

405
00:19:08,058 --> 00:19:10,193
You've been here one day, and
your father's already here.

406
00:19:10,194 --> 00:19:11,826
What are you talking about?

407
00:19:11,827 --> 00:19:14,600
Oh, I met him outside.
He's a really nice guy.

408
00:19:23,149 --> 00:19:26,515
Your Honor, the
defense would like to call for a recess.

409
00:19:26,516 --> 00:19:28,610
Excuse me. Who are you?

410
00:19:28,611 --> 00:19:31,247
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
My name is Shawn Spencer.

411
00:19:31,248 --> 00:19:32,915
I'm a psychic legal consultant
on this case.

412
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:36,756
Objection, Your Honor. We were not made
aware that a psychic was hired on this case.

413
00:19:36,757 --> 00:19:39,126
Approach the bench,
all of you.

414
00:19:39,464 --> 00:19:40,454
Sweet.

415
00:19:43,468 --> 00:19:45,230
Your Honor, the people
question his validity.

416
00:19:45,231 --> 00:19:47,827
Okay, first of all,
that's hurtful.

417
00:19:47,828 --> 00:19:49,566
Look, I know you're
the big bad prosecutor

418
00:19:49,567 --> 00:19:52,268
with the sweet head, but is
this tone really necessary?

419
00:19:52,269 --> 00:19:54,277
No. Look,
I'm a legitimate consultant.

420
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:56,677
I've been hired often by the
Santa Barbara Police Department,

421
00:19:56,678 --> 00:20:00,614
and there is a high-ranking detective
in this very courtroom right now,

422
00:20:00,615 --> 00:20:03,049
who will vouch
for my validity.

423
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,780
And who is this?

424
00:20:04,781 --> 00:20:08,221
He's right there. The wispy,
yet commanding Irish fellow,

425
00:20:08,222 --> 00:20:10,691
who looks like he's been
sucking on the Sour Patch Kids.

426
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:13,821
Will you stand and state
your name for the court?

427
00:20:14,832 --> 00:20:17,664
Carlton Lassiter, Santa Barbara
Police Department, Your Honor.

428
00:20:17,665 --> 00:20:21,032
Head detective,
11 years this May.

429
00:20:21,033 --> 00:20:24,665
Perhaps you'd like to inform the
court of your favorite color as well.

430
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,834
The point is,
do you know this man?

431
00:20:26,835 --> 00:20:27,932
I do.

432
00:20:27,933 --> 00:20:30,604
And has he worked on cases
for the department?

433
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:31,977
He has.

434
00:20:31,978 --> 00:20:33,275
There you have it.
There you have it.

435
00:20:33,276 --> 00:20:34,816
And he was helpful?

436
00:20:35,251 --> 00:20:36,616
Absolutely.

437
00:20:39,589 --> 00:20:41,419
Did he just say absolutely
with a little half smile?

438
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,548
I'd like that
printed out, please.

439
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:46,525
I'm thinking of shellacking it on a nice
piece of maple, maybe a little decoupage.

440
00:20:46,526 --> 00:20:48,358
Your Honor, as you can see,
I'm responsible

441
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:50,728
for breaking many cases here
in the state of California.

442
00:20:50,729 --> 00:20:55,168
Well, guess what? I don't care who you
are, or what you've done for the state.

443
00:20:55,169 --> 00:20:59,332
I don't believe in that psychic mumbo-jumbo
and it's not welcome in my court!

444
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,465
"Mumbo-jumbo"?

445
00:21:00,466 --> 00:21:04,033
Oh!
You poor, poor man.

446
00:21:04,034 --> 00:21:06,009
No wonder. You're...

447
00:21:06,548 --> 00:21:09,141
Passing a kidney
stone can be very stressful.

448
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,150
Who told you that?
I never told anyone.

449
00:21:11,151 --> 00:21:13,709
You tell me if I'm
overstepping my bounds here,

450
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:17,052
but I'd like to suggest an old home remedy
that did wonders for my Aunt Dolores.

451
00:21:17,053 --> 00:21:19,148
She simply gargled
with some mineral water,

452
00:21:19,149 --> 00:21:20,453
followed it up
with some raw greens.

453
00:21:20,454 --> 00:21:22,495
Me, personally,
I'd go with asparagus tips,

454
00:21:22,496 --> 00:21:26,829
that way, later on,
when you're making water,

455
00:21:28,002 --> 00:21:29,765
you'll know that it's working.

456
00:21:33,874 --> 00:21:35,341
Let's proceed with the trial.

457
00:21:38,111 --> 00:21:40,340
Okay, you got me? I'm startled.
What are you doing here?

458
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:41,778
Well, maybe
we're both psychics.

459
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:43,371
I am serious.

460
00:21:43,372 --> 00:21:45,849
Occasionally, I come down
here, I sit in on a trial.

461
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,647
Today, I get a phone call.

462
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,585
Guess who's practicing
law now?

463
00:21:49,586 --> 00:21:51,919
Wait a minute. You come
down here regularly?

464
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,754
Thursdays, usually.
Today was just a bonus.

465
00:21:54,755 --> 00:21:57,888
My God, you just
can't let go, can you?

466
00:21:58,498 --> 00:22:02,024
You retired too early. Not my fault. I
didn't ask you to turn in your badge, Dad.

467
00:22:02,025 --> 00:22:04,399
Shawn! Shawn! Shawn! I'm in
there trying to do something...

468
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,200
You seem to forget whose name you've
got at the end of your letterhead, kid.

469
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:11,401
When you use my name,
it is my business as well.

470
00:22:12,212 --> 00:22:13,872
Give me my phone.

471
00:22:16,615 --> 00:22:19,209
Took you long enough to
figure out the kidney stone.

472
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:25,882
Let it be noted that the witness
identified the defendant, Sandra Panitch,

473
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:31,119
as the woman he saw running through the
parking lot on the night of the murder.

474
00:22:32,163 --> 00:22:33,687
Has it been authenticated?

475
00:22:33,688 --> 00:22:36,358
Hey, what would Phelps need
to get authenticated?

476
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:37,867
I don't know.

477
00:22:37,868 --> 00:22:40,495
His little collection
of green army men?

478
00:22:40,496 --> 00:22:42,766
H-Stock, did you just
make a joke?

479
00:22:42,767 --> 00:22:44,273
Hmm?
I think you did.

480
00:22:45,332 --> 00:22:48,675
Your witness. Does the
defense wish to cross-examine?

481
00:22:50,313 --> 00:22:52,144
Your Honor, the defense rests.

482
00:22:52,145 --> 00:22:54,775
No. No, it doesn't.

483
00:22:56,621 --> 00:23:00,248
Your Honor, the defense may
rest. Why am I not resting?

484
00:23:00,249 --> 00:23:01,846
I have a vibe
that's very strong.

485
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:05,291
Hatred, jealousy. That guy
wanted to be a serious weatherman.

486
00:23:05,292 --> 00:23:07,989
He has no sympathy
for Jackson Hale whatsoever.

487
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,928
Wait. What?
You think he did it?

488
00:23:09,929 --> 00:23:12,058
No, I'm pretty sure he didn't.

489
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:14,329
But we can plant a seed.

490
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,303
Johnny Applestock.

491
00:23:16,304 --> 00:23:20,036
Your Honor, the defense
does not rest.

492
00:23:24,214 --> 00:23:28,809
Mr. Leonard, you are a
meteorologist, are you not?

493
00:23:29,686 --> 00:23:31,379
Yes, I am indeed.

494
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,215
But not on the air?

495
00:23:33,923 --> 00:23:35,719
No, not on the air.

496
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,853
Hmm. Maybe because you don't
have a meteorologist name.

497
00:23:40,854 --> 00:23:42,294
I don't follow.

498
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,330
Well, correct me if I'm wrong,

499
00:23:44,331 --> 00:23:49,063
but Leonard isn't a term
for any kind of weather?

500
00:23:49,872 --> 00:23:50,928
No, it is not.

501
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:55,305
So, if I was to look up Leonard,
in say, a weather glossary,

502
00:23:55,306 --> 00:23:56,603
there would be no definition?

503
00:23:56,604 --> 00:23:58,201
No, there would not.

504
00:23:58,202 --> 00:24:00,303
Excuse me,
where is this going?

505
00:24:00,304 --> 00:24:03,110
Yes, Mr. Hornstock,
where are you going with this?

506
00:24:03,111 --> 00:24:07,175
I'm sorry, Your Honor, it's just
that every successful weatherman

507
00:24:07,176 --> 00:24:10,553
that I know of,
has a real weatherman's name.

508
00:24:10,554 --> 00:24:13,788
Johnny Mountain, Dallas Rains?

509
00:24:14,361 --> 00:24:16,521
Oh, Jackson Hale, for example.

510
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:18,690
Hey, first of all that
wasn't even his real name.

511
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:19,958
Precisely.

512
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,660
Have you ever considered going
by the name of Bolt Lightning?

513
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:23,862
No.

514
00:24:26,139 --> 00:24:28,231
Cloudy McMillen?
No.

515
00:24:28,232 --> 00:24:29,898
Wendy Morning Dew?

516
00:24:29,899 --> 00:24:33,172
That's a woman's name.
Okay, look, I have a degree

517
00:24:33,173 --> 00:24:36,010
in meteorology from
the University of Virginia.

518
00:24:36,011 --> 00:24:38,607
I wrote my thesis
on Bernoulli's theorem

519
00:24:38,608 --> 00:24:40,310
of incompressible level flow,

520
00:24:40,311 --> 00:24:44,754
and I was a junior tornado
safety captain for seven years.

521
00:24:44,755 --> 00:24:47,258
Jackson Hale
has a degree in what?

522
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,087
Physical education
from a junior college.

523
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:52,686
He was an embarrassment.
He was worthless, all right?

524
00:24:52,687 --> 00:24:56,359
He was worthless to anyone who was
a real meteorologist like myself.

525
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,234
He should have been stabbed
in the heart long ago!

526
00:25:00,235 --> 00:25:02,103
Objection, Your Honor.

527
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:07,235
It's a little late for that,
don't you think, Counselor?

528
00:25:07,236 --> 00:25:09,006
That's the kind of confidence
I'm talking about.

529
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,104
That's what I'm talking about.

530
00:25:10,105 --> 00:25:12,309
We are on our way
to winning this thing.

531
00:25:16,087 --> 00:25:19,180
Told you. She's kind
and she's innocent.

532
00:25:19,181 --> 00:25:21,224
Just because we had a small
victory in court yesterday

533
00:25:21,225 --> 00:25:22,486
doesn't mean
we're out of the woods.

534
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:23,858
Son of a bitch!

535
00:25:24,062 --> 00:25:26,086
Alligator pumps! I swear,
I should arrest that weatherman.

536
00:25:26,087 --> 00:25:28,529
He clearly stated it was
not going to rain today.

537
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:32,592
You see, that's the problem with
what I like to call "group thinking."

538
00:25:32,593 --> 00:25:33,727
We don't listen
to group thinkers.

539
00:25:33,728 --> 00:25:34,792
Nope.

540
00:25:34,793 --> 00:25:36,065
In fact, we don't listen
to weathermen at all.

541
00:25:36,066 --> 00:25:39,541
If you excuse me, I've really
got better things to do.

542
00:25:40,011 --> 00:25:41,978
Dinner with your cat?

543
00:25:42,514 --> 00:25:43,843
O'Hara, are you coming?

544
00:25:43,844 --> 00:25:45,710
You go. I'll catch up
with you in a sec.

545
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:47,750
You know, Shawn,
for a psychic,

546
00:25:47,751 --> 00:25:51,412
you are missing something right in
front of your face. It's too bad.

547
00:25:51,413 --> 00:25:54,354
You might actually learn something
about Lassiter. Maybe you don't want to.

548
00:25:54,355 --> 00:25:56,051
He waxes his back?

549
00:25:56,052 --> 00:25:57,182
I'm gonna go now.

550
00:25:57,183 --> 00:26:00,958
Shawn, I don't care what anyone
else says. The pink shirt is working.

551
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:13,666
Okay, that was cryptic.

552
00:26:13,667 --> 00:26:15,573
Not really. I'll be damned.

553
00:26:29,492 --> 00:26:30,582
Who's Detective Assi?

554
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:34,788
Lassy. It's Lassiter. He must have
sent some sort of memo to Phelps.

555
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:37,228
The question is
why would Lassiter

556
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:39,232
send a letter
to the D.A.'s office?

557
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:41,063
<i>Don't you ever watch
Law and Order?</i>

558
00:26:41,064 --> 00:26:43,796
They tend to work
together sometimes.

559
00:26:43,797 --> 00:26:46,806
Right. So... So, go ahead
and check the files,

560
00:26:46,807 --> 00:26:48,431
and find me that letter.

561
00:26:48,432 --> 00:26:49,874
Phelps received it
on the seventh.

562
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:50,967
I've been through all of them.

563
00:26:50,968 --> 00:26:53,342
There are no memos submitted into
evidence, filed on the seventh.

564
00:26:53,343 --> 00:26:56,212
So, it didn't get filed.
But there is a memo.

565
00:26:57,185 --> 00:27:00,449
So whatever's on that memo
is clearly worth hiding.

566
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,719
And she told you
this directly?

567
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,782
Yes, when I questioned
the defendant,

568
00:27:06,783 --> 00:27:08,885
she admitted to having sexual
relations with the victim.

569
00:27:08,886 --> 00:27:11,954
But not to stabbing him
with a letter opener?

570
00:27:15,102 --> 00:27:19,059
Well, she appeared at the time to
be confused and had memory gaps.

571
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:21,663
She claimed never to have
seen or touched the weapon.

572
00:27:21,664 --> 00:27:25,439
Even though her fingerprints
were all over it. I see.

573
00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:29,938
Thank you, Detective Lassiter.
Nothing further.

574
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:31,809
Your witness.

575
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:32,872
You sure about this?

576
00:27:32,873 --> 00:27:35,475
Yes, I have a very strong
feeling about this letter.

577
00:27:35,476 --> 00:27:38,614
First rule of trial law, never ask a
question you don't know the answer to.

578
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:42,354
Hey, have I steered
you wrong yet? Come on.

579
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:48,125
Detective Lassiter,
did you send a letter

580
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:51,227
to the D.A.'s office
on the seventh of August?

581
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:53,968
Yes, I did.

582
00:27:53,969 --> 00:27:55,528
And what did it say?

583
00:27:55,529 --> 00:27:57,734
I... Objection,
lack of foundation.

584
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:01,403
I'll allow it. Go ahead,
tell the jury what it said.

585
00:28:01,404 --> 00:28:04,573
It questioned
the defendant's motive.

586
00:28:04,574 --> 00:28:06,844
That it was
very strong, you mean?

587
00:28:06,845 --> 00:28:09,752
No, it questioned whether I believed
the defendant had one at all.

588
00:28:11,155 --> 00:28:14,249
The prosecution never submitted
this letter into evidence.

589
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:17,658
So, at this point, Your Honor,
the defense calls for a mistrial.

590
00:28:21,165 --> 00:28:22,529
Man, this is fun!

591
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,123
Approach the bench.

592
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:29,898
We may have received the
letter. I... I can't be sure.

593
00:28:29,899 --> 00:28:32,372
We didn't knowingly
withhold it.

594
00:28:32,373 --> 00:28:34,341
My office is
wall to wall papers.

595
00:28:34,342 --> 00:28:37,676
Then go to Staples and buy
yourself some new file folders,

596
00:28:37,677 --> 00:28:40,182
but until then,
you are warned.

597
00:28:40,183 --> 00:28:44,276
Any new evidence must be submitted
to all parties immediately.

598
00:28:44,277 --> 00:28:46,253
Do I make myself clear?

599
00:28:46,254 --> 00:28:47,983
Yes, Your Honor.

600
00:28:47,984 --> 00:28:50,287
And in the spirit
of that ruling,

601
00:28:50,288 --> 00:28:52,553
I would like to submit
a new piece of evidence.

602
00:28:52,554 --> 00:28:56,655
If this is that willy-nilly piece
of evidence that you tried to get in,

603
00:28:56,656 --> 00:28:59,291
in pre-trial,
I'll tell you one more time.

604
00:28:59,292 --> 00:29:03,499
I will not admit any audio-visual
evidence unless it's been authenticated.

605
00:29:04,573 --> 00:29:05,802
<i>We're talking about
playing it to him.</i>

606
00:29:07,543 --> 00:29:08,531
It's a videotape.

607
00:29:08,532 --> 00:29:09,668
Hmm?

608
00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:12,713
We just got our authentication
papers from the lab in Sacramento.

609
00:29:12,714 --> 00:29:16,410
It is a videotape of the
defendant, Sandra Panitch,

610
00:29:16,411 --> 00:29:18,817
murdering the victim,
Jackson Hale.

611
00:29:30,131 --> 00:29:32,655
Judge, I argue that this tape
should not be admissible.

612
00:29:32,656 --> 00:29:33,792
On what grounds?

613
00:29:33,793 --> 00:29:37,030
Well, we're citing
unfair surprisery.

614
00:29:37,031 --> 00:29:39,868
I... I still don't understand
why he is in this room.

615
00:29:39,869 --> 00:29:41,567
He's nothing but a disruption.

616
00:29:41,568 --> 00:29:44,076
Maybe someday, Phelps,
when you're a judge,

617
00:29:44,077 --> 00:29:45,804
which I highly doubt
will happen,

618
00:29:45,805 --> 00:29:49,041
then you can decide who's
welcome in your chambers.

619
00:29:49,042 --> 00:29:52,574
Your Honor, these guys are a part
of my team, and I want them here.

620
00:29:52,575 --> 00:29:56,110
Why? You used to be
a good lawyer, Hornstock.

621
00:29:56,111 --> 00:30:00,023
But let's face it, if you've gotta
resort to hiring this idiot psychic

622
00:30:00,024 --> 00:30:01,184
and his little sidekick...

623
00:30:01,185 --> 00:30:02,352
I'm nobody's sidekick, you...

624
00:30:02,353 --> 00:30:03,793
Whoa! Gus, Gus.
Come on.

625
00:30:03,794 --> 00:30:05,160
Forget you.

626
00:30:05,161 --> 00:30:08,998
Gus, we are all grown men
here. Let's just take a beat.

627
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,904
Let's...
Let's take a step back.

628
00:30:13,707 --> 00:30:15,265
Let's take a step back.

629
00:30:18,045 --> 00:30:21,171
Mr. Hornstock, having now
seen the video in question,

630
00:30:21,172 --> 00:30:24,147
I don't think I need to
tell you how damaging it is.

631
00:30:24,148 --> 00:30:25,706
I strongly suggest
at this point

632
00:30:25,707 --> 00:30:29,117
that you consider accepting
a plea bargain for murder two.

633
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:32,816
Your Honor, I will have to review
the tape and confer with my client.

634
00:30:32,817 --> 00:30:34,755
I tell you
what, Hornstock.

635
00:30:34,756 --> 00:30:38,694
I will leave murder two on the
table until tomorrow morning.

636
00:30:38,695 --> 00:30:40,595
Consider that
my gift to you.

637
00:30:47,772 --> 00:30:49,466
She doesn't realize
she's being taped.

638
00:30:49,467 --> 00:30:52,600
No, I don't think this
is his first barbeque either,

639
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,473
if you know what I mean.

640
00:30:54,474 --> 00:30:57,604
This high-def plasma
really makes a difference.

641
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:00,478
I see the beads of sweat
on his neck.

642
00:31:00,479 --> 00:31:01,779
Look at his hair!

643
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,910
That's horrible!

644
00:31:04,012 --> 00:31:05,350
<i>Yeah.</i>

645
00:31:06,424 --> 00:31:07,617
<i>Oh, wow!</i>

646
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,987
Do any of you
make noises like that?

647
00:31:12,463 --> 00:31:13,452
His or hers?

648
00:31:19,904 --> 00:31:24,136
When she sees this, she
will certainly take the deal.

649
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:27,404
I'm not going to
take the deal.

650
00:31:27,405 --> 00:31:29,877
If you don't take the deal, you
could go away possibly for life.

651
00:31:29,878 --> 00:31:32,107
You do realize this?
I don't care.

652
00:31:32,108 --> 00:31:34,479
I'm not gonna admit
to something that I didn't do!

653
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,950
Okay, I believe you. I believe
you. But I watched that tape.

654
00:31:37,951 --> 00:31:41,717
And as your attorney, I am
begging you, take the deal.

655
00:31:41,718 --> 00:31:43,520
Don't take the deal.

656
00:31:43,993 --> 00:31:45,323
What are you doing?

657
00:31:45,324 --> 00:31:46,520
You're supposed to be
on my side.

658
00:31:46,521 --> 00:31:48,586
Hornstock, I am on your side.

659
00:31:48,587 --> 00:31:51,064
I mean, not technically, because
of the shape of this table.

660
00:31:51,065 --> 00:31:54,591
Imagine a round table. I would
have sat somewhere in the middle.

661
00:31:55,605 --> 00:31:58,767
Okay, tomorrow morning when
the jury watches this tape,

662
00:31:58,768 --> 00:32:01,205
we will lose this case.

663
00:32:01,206 --> 00:32:04,938
This tape is not telling us
the whole truth. There's more.

664
00:32:04,939 --> 00:32:08,379
I need to take this tape. You just
work on your closing arguments.

665
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,747
You leave the rest to me.

666
00:32:12,187 --> 00:32:13,881
Quit pacing, Shawn.
You're making me nervous.

667
00:32:13,882 --> 00:32:14,979
I can't afford it, Dad.

668
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:18,321
I can't afford a guilty verdict
on my record right now. I can't!

669
00:32:18,322 --> 00:32:21,418
You do realize that you're
not a real lawyer? Right?

670
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:23,292
You don't have a record.

671
00:32:23,293 --> 00:32:25,456
It's so weird. The prosecution
keeps treating this case

672
00:32:25,457 --> 00:32:27,363
like a crime of passion,
right?

673
00:32:27,364 --> 00:32:28,663
But she only knew him
for a couple of hours.

674
00:32:28,664 --> 00:32:32,671
I ask you, how much passion can you
muster up for someone in a couple of hours?

675
00:32:32,672 --> 00:32:36,197
Yeah, well, crimes of passion are
rarely about love or sex, Shawn.

676
00:32:36,198 --> 00:32:39,542
They're closer to revenge,
sometimes hatred.

677
00:32:39,947 --> 00:32:42,244
I would say that
your angry meteorologist

678
00:32:42,245 --> 00:32:44,010
is the best suspect
you got going.

679
00:32:44,011 --> 00:32:45,914
He didn't do it.
Yeah, I know that, Shawn.

680
00:32:45,915 --> 00:32:49,444
The point is you need to find
somebody who felt like that.

681
00:32:49,445 --> 00:32:52,423
Oh, Dad, believe me, there are plenty.
The guy slept with half of Santa Barbara.

682
00:32:52,424 --> 00:32:56,086
We put them all on the stand. The problem
is that Sandra is the only one who was there.

683
00:32:56,087 --> 00:32:58,152
You have a whisk.
I do.

684
00:32:58,153 --> 00:33:00,255
And you're not looking
close enough.

685
00:33:00,256 --> 00:33:01,560
Well, you know what?

686
00:33:01,561 --> 00:33:05,160
It's tough, when virtually everything
imaginable is stacked against me.

687
00:33:05,161 --> 00:33:07,296
I've got your ass staring me
down in the courtroom.

688
00:33:07,297 --> 00:33:10,103
I've got a defense attorney who
breaks every time the wind blows,

689
00:33:10,104 --> 00:33:12,268
I've got to hitch rides every
time I need to go somewhere

690
00:33:12,269 --> 00:33:15,677
because, get this, there's some rogue
meter maid who's decided to have

691
00:33:15,678 --> 00:33:17,682
a ticketing vendetta
against me and my motorcycle.

692
00:33:17,683 --> 00:33:20,184
Well, Shawn, maybe that might not
happen if you didn't park your bike

693
00:33:20,185 --> 00:33:22,686
<i>14 feet from a fire hydrant
outside your apartment.</i>

694
00:33:22,687 --> 00:33:25,883
Dad, you've seen my street.
The parking is a joke and...

695
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,818
How did you know that?

696
00:33:32,631 --> 00:33:35,394
Whoa, whoa, whoa. How did you
know that? Wait a second. How...

697
00:33:35,395 --> 00:33:37,866
How do you know that?

698
00:33:37,867 --> 00:33:40,632
Oh, look who's paying
attention now?

699
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:44,170
You tipped them off? You
tipped them off about my bike?

700
00:33:44,171 --> 00:33:46,142
Who taught you
how to drive, Shawn?

701
00:33:46,143 --> 00:33:49,701
Who do you represent every
time you're out on that road?

702
00:33:49,702 --> 00:33:53,149
I don't represent anybody
when I go out on the road!

703
00:33:53,618 --> 00:33:55,448
Dad, they took my bike!

704
00:33:55,449 --> 00:33:56,713
Tell it to the embassy.

705
00:33:56,714 --> 00:33:59,187
And I might not be
able to get it out of the impound.

706
00:33:59,188 --> 00:34:01,087
Yeah, well, then maybe it's
time for you to consider

707
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:03,627
a real mode
of transportation, huh?

708
00:34:04,495 --> 00:34:08,190
You will do anything you can
to impose your will on me.

709
00:34:08,191 --> 00:34:11,827
You hated that bike. You
have always hated that bike.

710
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:14,898
And you've been especially
hard ass about it since I...

711
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:18,133
Since you what, Shawn? Since you
what? Since you had your accident?

712
00:34:18,134 --> 00:34:20,198
Is that is? Is that where
your old man crossed the line?

713
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:23,006
Fine, I tell you what. I will
back off, I'm gonna lay off, man.

714
00:34:23,007 --> 00:34:24,273
I'll tell you what you do.

715
00:34:24,274 --> 00:34:26,837
You take me off your call list the
next time the ambulance picks you up

716
00:34:26,838 --> 00:34:30,080
and brings you in that door.
All right? Fair.

717
00:34:31,955 --> 00:34:33,922
Get over yourself, kid.

718
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:37,225
Or at least
learn how to park.

719
00:34:49,772 --> 00:34:52,832
Shawn, what are you doing?
Do you know what time it is?

720
00:34:53,309 --> 00:34:55,776
What? What time...
What time is it?

721
00:34:55,777 --> 00:34:57,937
It's 9:00.
We're late for court.

722
00:34:57,938 --> 00:34:59,947
I called you a million times.

723
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:01,503
Gus...

724
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,606
What?

725
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:05,414
Would you say anger
is a good motivator?

726
00:35:05,415 --> 00:35:07,421
Did you see your dad again?
Yes, I did.

727
00:35:08,423 --> 00:35:10,357
And I think
it actually worked.

728
00:35:15,162 --> 00:35:16,926
Mr. Hornstock?

729
00:35:17,932 --> 00:35:20,330
Your Honor, the defense
has nothing more.

730
00:35:20,331 --> 00:35:21,867
Not so fast.

731
00:35:21,868 --> 00:35:23,232
Excuse me?

732
00:35:23,233 --> 00:35:25,293
Call Priscilla Osterman
to the stand.

733
00:35:25,294 --> 00:35:27,134
What are you talking about?
She already testified.

734
00:35:27,135 --> 00:35:28,606
Can we recall her?

735
00:35:28,607 --> 00:35:29,868
Yes, if we have
new information,

736
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:31,103
but I have nothing
else to ask her.

737
00:35:31,104 --> 00:35:34,238
Oh, trust me. I'm feeling
all kinds of good stuff here.

738
00:35:35,115 --> 00:35:40,051
Your Honor, the defense calls
Miss Osterman back to the stand.

739
00:35:40,052 --> 00:35:41,379
Objection.

740
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,045
Overruled.

741
00:35:43,046 --> 00:35:44,749
I'm giving you
the teeniest latitude

742
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:47,758
providing you have some
new evidence to mine here.

743
00:35:47,759 --> 00:35:51,319
Miss Osterman, I remind you
that you are still under oath.

744
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,488
Proceed, Counselor.

745
00:35:52,489 --> 00:35:54,931
Ask her if she is
absolutely certain

746
00:35:55,201 --> 00:35:57,635
that she did not sleep
with Jackson Hale.

747
00:36:00,373 --> 00:36:04,706
Miss Osterman, are you
absolutely certain

748
00:36:04,707 --> 00:36:06,902
you did not sleep
with Jackson Hale?

749
00:36:06,903 --> 00:36:10,277
Objection, Your Honor. Asked
and answered in prior testimony.

750
00:36:10,278 --> 00:36:11,815
Sustained.
I'm not kidding, Counselor,

751
00:36:11,816 --> 00:36:13,248
I'm giving you
one more question,

752
00:36:13,249 --> 00:36:15,378
and then
I'm shutting you down.

753
00:36:18,123 --> 00:36:19,146
Did you want to?

754
00:36:19,147 --> 00:36:22,557
Objection! This man
is not a lawyer.

755
00:36:22,558 --> 00:36:24,754
He has no right
to address the witness.

756
00:36:24,755 --> 00:36:27,729
Actually, Your Honor,
he can, under the rule 775A

757
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:29,823
of the California state
rules of evidence.

758
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,458
The rule gives the court
wide discretion

759
00:36:31,459 --> 00:36:33,230
over the mode and order
of presenting evidence,

760
00:36:33,231 --> 00:36:35,363
effective for the
ascertainment of the truth.

761
00:36:35,364 --> 00:36:37,499
<i>Precedence
Killmer v. Duchscherer.</i>

762
00:36:38,076 --> 00:36:40,543
I mean, we are trying to ascertain
the truth here, aren't we?

763
00:36:40,544 --> 00:36:42,772
That is absolutely
correct, young man.

764
00:36:42,773 --> 00:36:44,403
Where did you attend
law school?

765
00:36:44,404 --> 00:36:45,880
Just sixth grade law,
Your Honor.

766
00:36:45,881 --> 00:36:47,884
But it was
an accelerated program.

767
00:36:47,885 --> 00:36:48,941
Hmm.

768
00:36:49,787 --> 00:36:52,653
It is up to my discretion
to allow any testimony

769
00:36:52,654 --> 00:36:54,849
that may speak
to the truth of this case.

770
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:56,892
Proceed, Mr. Spencer,
with caution.

771
00:36:56,893 --> 00:36:58,895
Thank you, Your Honor.

772
00:37:00,029 --> 00:37:01,156
All right.

773
00:37:01,699 --> 00:37:03,667
Just warming her up
for you, bro. Yeah, go.

774
00:37:05,803 --> 00:37:07,531
Hi, Priscilla.
Hi.

775
00:37:08,137 --> 00:37:10,229
Everybody here
is absolutely certain

776
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,170
you didn't sleep
with Jackson Hale.

777
00:37:12,171 --> 00:37:17,509
But Jackson Hale slept
with everybody.

778
00:37:19,015 --> 00:37:21,039
Except for you.
Isn't that right?

779
00:37:21,517 --> 00:37:23,143
You couldn't take it,
could you?

780
00:37:23,144 --> 00:37:25,618
Him walking by
every single day

781
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:28,451
without ever noticing you.
Not once!

782
00:37:28,657 --> 00:37:30,419
Repeatedly choosing
to sleep with women

783
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,357
like the defendant,
Sandra Panitch!

784
00:37:32,358 --> 00:37:34,919
Oh, that's...
That's not true.

785
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:38,793
That video will show
Jackson Hale being murdered.

786
00:37:39,034 --> 00:37:41,264
But not by Sandra Panitch.

787
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,161
By you.

788
00:37:43,162 --> 00:37:46,638
Objection, Your Honor. I mean,
this is... It's ridiculous.

789
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:51,144
I feel the tape is the proof!
The tape is the pudding!

790
00:37:51,145 --> 00:37:52,736
Your Honor, I said objection!

791
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:54,302
I demand you get him
to stop that!

792
00:37:54,303 --> 00:37:58,978
Sit down. Do you need
a tutorial in rule 775?

793
00:37:59,688 --> 00:38:03,418
Mr. Riggs, can you please
play the tape again?

794
00:38:05,027 --> 00:38:08,257
Thank you. Just take it
back a little bit.

795
00:38:08,596 --> 00:38:12,623
Forward, I'm sorry, forward.
And back. Forward. Right there!

796
00:38:17,805 --> 00:38:19,704
Right there.

797
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:22,333
Right here.

798
00:38:26,713 --> 00:38:32,777
That. That right there. It's a
cloud. Not a cloud, a shadow.

799
00:38:33,453 --> 00:38:36,183
A shadow of a human person.

800
00:38:39,426 --> 00:38:41,825
You were wearing
those glasses that night,

801
00:38:41,826 --> 00:38:47,060
making it unmistakable
that you were there.

802
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:51,327
That is your shadow,
Priscilla.

803
00:38:52,005 --> 00:38:54,438
<i>You watched.
You waited,</i>

804
00:38:54,973 --> 00:38:56,668
<i>waited for them
to drop out of frame.</i>

805
00:38:56,669 --> 00:38:59,302
Then bam on the head
to Sandra. And...

806
00:39:00,479 --> 00:39:02,344
Into the heart
with Jackson!

807
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,581
You didn't think there was
any way you could be blamed

808
00:39:07,582 --> 00:39:11,109
because clouds
don't kill people.

809
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,953
People kill people.

810
00:39:14,614 --> 00:39:17,194
And this was
a crime of passion.

811
00:39:17,195 --> 00:39:19,526
But not because he loved you.

812
00:39:21,566 --> 00:39:23,591
But because he didn't.

813
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:28,166
He walked by me in the hallway
every day, like I didn't exist,

814
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,672
like I was invisible.

815
00:39:30,673 --> 00:39:35,440
And so you proved him right,
by being invisible on that tape.

816
00:39:35,441 --> 00:39:37,546
We would have been
the most amazing couple,

817
00:39:37,547 --> 00:39:39,879
he just refused to see it.

818
00:39:41,184 --> 00:39:44,778
He just broke my heart over
and over and over again.

819
00:39:44,779 --> 00:39:46,014
So, I just broke his!

820
00:39:46,015 --> 00:39:47,521
By stabbing it
with a letter opener!

821
00:39:47,522 --> 00:39:50,185
Yes! Yes, I killed him!

822
00:39:50,186 --> 00:39:51,318
No!

823
00:39:52,761 --> 00:39:53,886
Oh.

824
00:39:53,887 --> 00:39:56,431
Holy crap! Did you
just hear that?

825
00:39:56,432 --> 00:39:58,195
We heard that, yes.

826
00:39:58,468 --> 00:39:59,593
Sorry, Your Honor.
It's just that usually

827
00:39:59,594 --> 00:40:01,226
when I do this, when things
come to me psychically,

828
00:40:01,227 --> 00:40:02,860
I gotta jump through
all these hoops, you know?

829
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:04,098
I gotta find
Interim Chief Vic,

830
00:40:04,099 --> 00:40:05,504
I gotta run stuff
by Lassy, there.

831
00:40:05,505 --> 00:40:07,905
Sign a bunch of papers,
t's, i's, the whole bit.

832
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,273
It seems like we got
everything we need here.

833
00:40:09,274 --> 00:40:12,142
You, the jury, the
stenographer, Mr. Riggs!

834
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:14,943
I move to remove
the defendant immediately.

835
00:40:14,944 --> 00:40:18,076
And take the witness
into custody for processing.

836
00:40:18,077 --> 00:40:21,385
Bailiff! Case dismissed.

837
00:40:24,593 --> 00:40:27,322
You mean to tell me, our whole lives,
you've never been to a single auction?

838
00:40:27,323 --> 00:40:29,260
Nope. Dude, watch
this, it's very fun.

839
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:30,921
How's it fun? You're
bidding against the public

840
00:40:30,922 --> 00:40:32,057
for your own motorcycle.

841
00:40:32,058 --> 00:40:33,463
What if somebody outbids you?

842
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:35,502
I've been practicing my
paddle raise, it's very subtle.

843
00:40:35,503 --> 00:40:36,594
Where is this thing?

844
00:40:36,595 --> 00:40:39,037
Plus now that Carter Jarecki's
wife has hired us

845
00:40:39,038 --> 00:40:40,903
to consult on her divorce,
we're flush.

846
00:40:40,904 --> 00:40:42,236
I can go as high
as I need to go.

847
00:40:42,237 --> 00:40:43,402
Okay.

848
00:40:44,946 --> 00:40:46,003
Dad?

849
00:40:46,004 --> 00:40:47,307
Shawn!

850
00:40:47,308 --> 00:40:49,373
What are you doing here?
I came for your auction.

851
00:40:50,418 --> 00:40:52,351
What? Was there a boating
incident I didn't hear about?

852
00:40:52,352 --> 00:40:53,680
A little tuna boat
get impounded?

853
00:40:53,681 --> 00:40:54,812
You know,
actually, Shawn, no.

854
00:40:54,813 --> 00:40:56,047
I felt bad
about those tickets,

855
00:40:56,048 --> 00:40:57,920
so I'm here to get
your bike for you.

856
00:40:57,921 --> 00:40:59,116
Get out of here.

857
00:40:59,117 --> 00:41:01,319
Hey, Shawn! Gus! What's up?

858
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,259
Hey, legal eagle!

859
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,422
I thought I might
see you here.

860
00:41:05,423 --> 00:41:08,296
Oh, you know? The name
partners were very impressed,

861
00:41:08,297 --> 00:41:10,392
and they're anxious
to hire you guys again.

862
00:41:10,393 --> 00:41:12,995
Especially this new guy.
What's his name?

863
00:41:12,996 --> 00:41:14,369
Oh, it's me!

864
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:15,430
Hey!

865
00:41:16,009 --> 00:41:17,737
Congratulations.
You got the bump!

866
00:41:17,738 --> 00:41:18,799
Thank you.

867
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,866
We'd love to work
with you again.

868
00:41:19,867 --> 00:41:21,640
So, what is it now,
"Hornstock, Hornstock,

869
00:41:21,641 --> 00:41:23,011
"Hornstock, Biederman
and Hornstock"?

870
00:41:23,012 --> 00:41:25,414
We had to get
wider doors, but yes.

871
00:41:25,415 --> 00:41:26,951
Hey, I didn't get
to thank you properly.

872
00:41:26,952 --> 00:41:28,713
So, you know,
I'm here for the auction.

873
00:41:28,714 --> 00:41:30,723
I'm gonna put some money down on
that bike. Get it back for you.

874
00:41:31,848 --> 00:41:33,948
Guys, really. I do. I
appreciate it, it's very sweet,

875
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,822
but I can stand
on my own two feet

876
00:41:35,823 --> 00:41:37,327
and get my own bike back.

877
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,522
Shawn!

878
00:41:38,764 --> 00:41:39,787
Buzz.

879
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:42,459
I believe this is yours. They
just pulled it from the auction.

880
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,831
Pulled it from
the auction. What?

881
00:41:43,832 --> 00:41:47,496
I was... I was... I've been practicing
my paddle raise. It's a subtle move.

882
00:41:47,497 --> 00:41:50,631
Yeah, you got your bike back.
It was taken care of internally.

883
00:41:50,632 --> 00:41:52,699
What does that mean?
"Internally"?

884
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,337
I don't know. They just
gave me the paperwork.

885
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:04,350
What are you looking at?
Go home!

886
00:42:14,733 --> 00:42:18,633
<i>In between the lines
there's a lot of obscurity</i>

887
00:42:18,634 --> 00:42:21,796
<i>I'm not inclined
to resign to maturity</i>

888
00:42:21,797 --> 00:42:25,204
<i>If it's all right
then you're all wrong</i>

889
00:42:25,205 --> 00:42:29,076
<i>But why bounce around
to the same damn song?</i>

890
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:34,013
<i>You'd rather run
when you can't crawl</i>

891
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:39,547
<i>I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth</i>

892
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:42,823
<i>I know, you know
They just don't have any proof</i>

893
00:42:42,824 --> 00:42:46,054
<i>Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend</i>

894
00:42:46,055 --> 00:42:50,225
<i>Your worst inhibitions tend
to psych you out in the end</i>

895
00:42:50,226 --> 00:42:51,824
<i>I know, you know</i>

896
00:42:53,736 --> 00:42:55,601
<i>I know, you know</i>
