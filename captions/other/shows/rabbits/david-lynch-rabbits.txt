I am going to find out one day.
When will you tell it?
Were there any calls?
What time is it?
Laughter.
I have a secret.
There have been no calls today.
I am not sure.
A coincidence.
Do not forget that today is Friday.
Where was it?
I hear someone.
There is something I would like to say to you, Suzie.
Jack gets up, exits.
Oh?
It must be after 7pm.
I have heard those things being said before.
I will bet you’re both wondering.
It is still raining.
I have misplaced it. I am sure of it now.
All day.
Laughter.
It was a man in a green suit.
Why?
It may even be later.
I am going to get them.
Where was I?
I only wish that they would go somewhere.
I almost forgot.
Were you blond? Suzie?
I could hear it also.
When it happens, you will know it.
There was a call for you earlier in the day.
We are not going anywhere.
I almost forgot.
I knew that was what happened each time I thought about it.
Are you going to tell?
It is the rain.
I was wondering when Suzie was going to do that.
Who was it?
It must be the rain.
It is 11:15pm. It is dark outside.
Quiet!
Let me tell you.
I do not think it is the rain.
He goes to work each morning, and then he comes back home each night.
It may have been a coincidence.
It did not happen that way.
Jane sits on the couch, Suzie irons.
When did you say that?
It was the voice of a man.
I do not think it will be much longer now.
Where is it that you think I went?
I was speaking about the other night.
I do not know where Jack is.
I was near the harbor after it happened. It was raining.
It is 8:35pm.
Who was on the phone?
It is still raining.
It has always been like that.
When did you go out?
I have known since I was seven.
It happens all the time.
Jack gets up and answers the phone. Suzie turns.
There is no moon tonight.
I said it looks like it is still raining.
Where was it, exactly? Do you remember?
Is it that late?
Jack hangs up the phone, sits.
Since then?
And getting darker.
I saw it, too.
I am not sure.
I went earlier, when it was just light.
I need to tell you something.
It was red.
Did he say anything?
You could not do anything?
No one can know about this.
It happened to me only once.
It's past midnight!
All day.
There is something here!
It happened like that earlier.
Who could have known?
I heard it too.
Do not forget what I have told you.
And then, there it was.
No. Nothing.
Well, then. It must be very dark.
It was the man in the green coat.
I wonder who I will be.
