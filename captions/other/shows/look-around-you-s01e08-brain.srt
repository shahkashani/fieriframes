1
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,471
Look around you.

2
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,272
Look around you.

3
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,835
Just look around you.

4
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,519
Have you worked out
what we're looking for?

5
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,080
Correct.

6
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,799
The answer is...

7
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,560
This programme, "The Brain",
is sadly the last in the series,

8
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,031
and can be found
at the very end of your textbook.

9
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,197
Please ensure you have
your copybook at hand,

10
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,159
as you'll be asked to take down
notes from the screen

11
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,835
at various points
throughout the programme.

12
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,876
What is the brain?

13
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,317
If you don' t know that,
you've forgotten how to think.

14
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,951
You see, the brain is many things.

15
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,957
It's a calculator,
a dictionary, a battery,

16
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,000
a camera, a TV and radio.

17
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,070
In fact, it's all of these things
and more.

18
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,632
Pretty smart for something that
resembles a garden cauliflower.

19
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,191
The brain is basically
a wrinkled bag of skin

20
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,036
filled with warm water,
veins and thought muscles.

21
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,472
Think of it as a kind of modified
heart, only with a mind or brain.

22
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,752
It sits atop the body issuing its
orders to the various components,

23
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,834
controlling our walking
and jumping,

24
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,555
eye-to-eye coordination.

25
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,840
Regulating our size.

26
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,559
In fact, pretty much everything
we do is governed by its decisions.

27
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,440
It's a right old bossyboots!

28
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,833
The opposite of the brain
is probably the bum.

29
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,949
It's nowhere near as intelligent
as the brain.

30
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,440
It doesn' t have to be,

31
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,474
as it only needs to make
very basic calculations.

32
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,672
An experiment was carried out

33
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,277
to illustrate the effects
of brainial stimulation.

34
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,760
For this experiment,

35
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,550
we're going to use a small area
of our subject's brain

36
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,355
known as the broab.

37
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,832
Using a hand drill,

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,630
a small hole is formed
at the base of Nigel's skull.

39
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,910
You don' t have to be a brain
surgeon operate on the brain,

40
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,675
but you will need some training.

41
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,039
After all, you'd hardly call out
a hairdresser to fix a carburettor.

42
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,997
Now a thin probe is slowly inserted
into our hole

43
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,119
so that the probe probes the broab.

44
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,234
Observe the reaction and note
the results down in your copybook.

45
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,000
At first, Nigel appears
to experience some discomfort.

46
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,589
But this soon gives way
to a feeling of elation.

47
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,710
And as we force the probe deeper,
it induces this reaction.

48
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,631
A feeling of wanting to sneeze
but being completely unable to.

49
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,313
If you're trying this experiment
for yourself,

50
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,359
be aware that the effect
is often permanent.

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,799
Write that down
in your copybook now.

52
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,356
These days most of us know
someone who's had an EBE,

53
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,796
an electronic brain enhancement.

54
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,831
People get it done
for a variety of reasons.

55
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,038
For example,
if you want to read faster.

56
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,479
Or to think up funnier jokes
in social situations.

57
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,597
She seems to like it.

58
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,991
Tempting, isn' t it?

59
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,550
But just take a look
at this young man.

60
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,232
Don' t be a fool.

61
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,077
It's not just humans or animals
that have a brain.

62
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,755
Almost every living being has one.

63
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:14,037
If we look inside one of these
peas, we can see its tiny brain.

64
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,235
Look at the little ridges,

65
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,431
down which the pea sends
electrical impulses to other peas,

66
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,958
determining its daily duties
and its status in the pod.

67
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,395
Let's pop it back inside now,
and leave the pea be.

68
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,112
An experiment was carried out

69
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,956
to illustrate the brain's
powers of perception.

70
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,640
First, a human brain is lowered
gently into a solution of brine.

71
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,189
Next, we connect a 9-volt battery,

72
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,230
so an electrical current flows
through the brine into the brain.

73
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,999
Finally, a telephone line
is installed...

74
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,676
..and the experiment can begin.

75
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,312
We're going to set the brain
a simple problem,

76
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,040
so have your pen and paper ready.

77
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,637
Brain, how many nuts
are there in this jar?

78
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,840
The brain sets to work
until reaches its answer.

79
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,830
(PHONE RINGS)

80
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,833
Hello?

81
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,992
It's the brain.

82
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,880
Can I have your answer, please?

83
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,953
OK.

84
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,353
Hi.

85
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,120
Thank you. Goodbye.

86
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,870
Here's the brain's estimation.

87
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,713
54.

88
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,190
Let's see if the brain is right.

89
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,271
Exactly...

90
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,472
54 nuts.

91
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,711
Well done.

92
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,271
As a reward, the brain is fed.

93
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,640
What a clever little brain.

94
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,679
We hope you enjoyed this series
as much we enjoyed making it.

95
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,676
And so, we raise a glass to you,
the viewer.

96
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,312
There's no need to open
the champagne now.

97
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,633
Perhaps we'll save it
for the next series.

98
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,075
Until then, take care of yourself.

99
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,914
And remember, look around you.
