1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:07,753
This is BBC2. In a moment
we'll be stepping into the future

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,918
for our weekly look
at science and technology

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,952
with the Look Around You team.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,310
But first let's take a look
at the line-up

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,751
for this coming
St Frankenstein's Day.

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,912
(2nd man) Programmes for
St Frankenstein's Day on BBC2

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,031
begin at 4.35 with Watch The Dot.

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,757
Watching the dot this week
are Colin Buckles and Larry Matador.

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,555
At 4.55, six-sided fun
with The Hexagons.

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,117
Eyebrows are raised when Mofferty
goes on a date with a rectangle.

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,837
At 5.10 it's Television's
Funniest Scientific Mishaps.

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,758
(Canned laughter)

13
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,235
Followed at 5.40 by The Colour Bars.

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,317
(Flat tone)

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,956
At six o'clock
it's The Backwards News.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,640
(Speaking backwards)

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,870
And at 6.30 we pay another
enchanting visit

18
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,310
to Tlentifini Maarhaysu.

19
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,630
A special St Frankenstein's Day
church service follows at 7.40,

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,196
broadcast live
from Dracula's Cathedral.

21
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,235
At 10.10 it's The Honey Programme,
hosted by David Bumblebee,

22
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,560
whose guests this week include lead
singer of new pop group, The Police.

23
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,716
Imagine That! is at 11 o'clock

24
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,832
and this week
the businessmen are imagining

25
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,873
The Two Ronnies
having sex with each other.

26
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,992
And with pages from CEEFAX at 11.55

27
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,637
that rounds up viewing
for St Frankenstein's Day on BBC2!

28
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,520
(Man) Well, that's certainly
something to look forward to.

29
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,315
But now let's go to Shepherd's Bush
for Look Around You.

30
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,557
Feeling hungry now?

31
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,240
Hello, and welcome
to Look Around You.

32
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,078
As you've probably guessed,

33
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,830
tonight's programme
is all about the future of food.

34
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,509
We've got a jam-packed show tonight.

35
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,280
We'll be visiting
the restaurant of the future

36
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,710
and sampling the latest
hi-tech cuisine.

37
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,717
Like this clever idea -
recycled food,

38
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,436
made using the leftovers
from hotels and hospitals.

39
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,110
But don't worry, none of this food
will be going to waste.

40
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,437
As you can see
it's all being eaten by Tony Parker,

41
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,234
better known as the human dustbin.

42
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,272
He's raising money for charity

43
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,358
and he'll be eating
all the food you see tonight.

44
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,995
And believe me,
there's a lot of food.

45
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,080
Whoa! He won't be eating this.

46
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,796
It's the latest birthday cake
from Japan

47
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,150
because today is Pam's birthday.

48
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:08,071
And later on we'll be trying a truly
futuristic birthday party for her

49
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,157
and you're all invited.

50
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,116
â™ª Look Around You â™ª

51
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,636
(Pam) Britain is fat.

52
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,557
Very fat.

53
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,719
And it's hardly surprising
when you consider how many meals

54
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,594
the average Briton eats
every single day.

55
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,118
So what can be done
to get Britain back in shape?

56
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,755
The government have tried
everything,

57
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,634
from swimming lanes
alongside motorways

58
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,956
to on the spot fines for obesity.

59
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,799
But nothing has proved at all
successful.

60
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,710
Until now, with the launch of
a controversial new slimming aid.

61
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,757
(Man) I was very unhappy,

62
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,838
I never used to go out
because of me size.

63
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,159
I wasn't sure but I think me friends
made fun of me behind me back

64
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,432
but nothing was ever proved.

65
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,359
(Man) Andy Gough talks about Slimby.

66
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,677
I would eat anything
I could get me hands on.

67
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,760
One time I was so desperate
I even ate poisoned berries.

68
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,077
I tried everything
but nothing worked for me.

69
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,239
Until one day
a friend told me about Slimby.

70
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,718
(Man) Slimby is the fastest and most
convenient way to lose weight.

71
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,229
Take a glass of Slimby
at every meal time

72
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,476
then look at the special picture

73
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,477
and let Slimby do the rest.

74
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,752
It helped Andy Gough
become Slimmer of the Year.

75
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,077
I lost 52 stone in just six weeks.

76
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,032
And you can too.

77
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,911
Please welcome Slimmer of the Year
and the face of Slimby, Andy Gough.

78
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,113
- Welcome to Look Around You.
- Thank you.

79
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,949
- Firstly, you look fantastic.
- Oh, thanks.

80
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,038
And can I just say, Pam,
happy birthday.

81
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,030
Thank you. Now, Andy, clearly you
can lose a lot of weight with Slimby

82
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,072
but tell us, how does it work?

83
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,192
Well, Slimby is
a double action diet system,

84
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,598
the Slimby shake works by
loosening all your fat molecules

85
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,872
so it turns your body fat
into fluid.

86
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,435
Then when you look at
the special picture

87
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,597
it shocks your system so much

88
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,156
that it pushes the fat out
through the pores of your skin.

89
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,998
(Pam) Which you can shower off.

90
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,590
Yes, or scrape off,
or wipe down with a towel.

91
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,192
Now, what is it about the special
picture that makes it so effective?

92
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,675
It's an exceedingly scary picture.

93
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,280
They spent months researching images

94
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,677
to come up with the one
that was the most shocking

95
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,953
and what they have is more
horrifying than you could imagine.

96
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,516
Well, we're going to show you
the special picture now.

97
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,191
We all saw it earlier on
and it is particularly terrifying.

98
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,631
So much so that the BBC have only
just granted us permission

99
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,273
to show it at all.

100
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,796
So if you have any children watching
please take them out of the room.

101
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,400
And if you're of
a nervous disposition

102
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,672
please look away from
your television screens.

103
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,116
May we now please show
the special picture.

104
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,996
And you may now
look back at your screens.

105
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,714
Clearly that is
a very disturbing image.

106
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,240
It is.

107
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,114
You must have seen it
hundreds of times.

108
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,517
I have to admit
I have seen it so much

109
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,995
I have become pretty immune to it.

110
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,397
So what do you do if you get
the urge to overeat again?

111
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,114
Well, I have my own visual aid -

112
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,152
and this is it.

113
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,795
I kept all the body fat I lost,

114
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,719
and every time I look at it
I just lose my appetite.

115
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,717
That is a good idea.

116
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,797
Gosh, you were carrying
a lot of weight.

117
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,399
Yes, I know.

118
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,194
- (Fat grunts)
- Is it alive?

119
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,472
I think it's a bit alive.

120
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,150
Well, thank you very much, Andy,
for showing us Slimby

121
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,035
and your former self,
and best of luck with the campaign.

122
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:37,080
(Peter) In today's modern world
it seems that none of us

123
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,591
has any time to do anything
any more, least of all eat.

124
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,590
Which is why more and more of us are
turning to fast food establishments.

125
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,360
And when you hear
the words "fast food"

126
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,518
you automatically
think of one thing -

127
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,552
casserole.

128
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,679
You can hardly walk down
your high street now

129
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,396
without noticing the smell
of casserole being prepared

130
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,512
in one of Britain's
20,000 casserole cafes.

131
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,474
Most of us have a casserole
a couple of times a week

132
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,991
but for some - notably
fashion-conscious teenagers -

133
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,160
the figure can rise to three or
three casseroles every single day.

134
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,477
That's great news
for the British meat industry,

135
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,080
and for O'Gravy's,
the market leader,

136
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,955
but now there's a new challenger
to the casserole crown.

137
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,872
Big C is a new company

138
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,038
which could revolutionise
the way we eat casserole.

139
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,959
And it's all thanks to
British technology.

140
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,351
Clive Pounds
is the managing director of Big C.

141
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,314
..way forward in this company
is efficiency, basically,

142
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,716
and if you're gonna turn up late...

143
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,390
I've always loved casseroles,
ever since I was young,

144
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,400
but you go to these casserole places
these days and...

145
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,831
well, you'll pardon
my language, they're shit.

146
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,352
Terrible casseroles, rude waiters,
dirty surfaces,

147
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,393
toilets that stink, it's disgusting.

148
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,750
So what's so different about Big C?

149
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,872
Well, Big C is the world's first

150
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,913
totally automated
casserole restaurant.

151
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,032
We've designed it
so that every aspect,

152
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,800
from ordering
to receiving the casserole,

153
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,877
is controlled by a computer.

154
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,674
And you're going to give
Look Around You

155
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,440
a sneak preview of Big C
before you open?

156
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,154
That's right.
And I'm sure you'll agree

157
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,399
that Big C is the casserole
restaurant of the 21st century.

158
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,397
- (Intercom buzzes)
- Excuse me.

159
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,160
- Clive, it's ready.
- OK, Tammy.

160
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,954
- (Door opens)
- Ah, our casseroles.

161
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,959
You will join us for breakfast,
won't you?

162
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,196
How could I refuse?

163
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,719
There are some perks to this job,
you know.

164
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,356
Mm. Mm.

165
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,672
He does love his casseroles.

166
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,235
You can see the second part
of Peter's report

167
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,272
later in the programme.

168
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,472
(â™ª Upbeat march)

169
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,912
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.

170
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,078
- How's space?
- Yes. Very pretty.

171
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,430
We're off to Neptune this afternoon.

172
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,551
That sounds nice.

173
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,514
Are you eating properly, darling?
I do worry about you.

174
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,076
Yes, I am.
Tonight I'm having my favourite -

175
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,635
roast turkey, potatoes and peas.

176
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,998
- And how is Rafferty?
- He's fine. He misses you.

177
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,953
- Give him my love.
- Will do.

178
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,390
(Both screech)

179
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,797
Well, today we might not all have
pet coravinians

180
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,400
but the food pill
has become a reality.

181
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,591
And it's being used at the moment

182
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,633
on the British space mission
to destroy Mars.

183
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,640
Well, space-age food came to
Birmingham last week with Foodex,

184
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,718
the catering industry's
annual exhibition,

185
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,754
showcasing the latest food products
from all over the world.

186
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,156
Thousands of items were on display,

187
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,114
from an underwater supermarket
to an albino raisin.

188
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,880
Here's Look Around You's
pick of the crop.

189
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,760
If you've ever wondered how many
peas there are on your plate

190
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,634
then the electronic pea counter
could be for you.

191
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,310
It's suitable for both domestic
and professional use

192
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,592
as it's accurate to
one pea in a hundred million.

193
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,915
(Beeps)

194
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,595
(Pealy) This pizza
could be a real life saver

195
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,553
because it's a medicinal pizza.

196
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,196
Designed by the NHS,
it's prepared at the hospital

197
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,436
and delivered by ambulance.

198
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,234
(Jack) Here's a cheaper, sweeter
alternative to the banana.

199
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,280
Made from sugar turnip
and animal fats,

200
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,472
the nabana is just as versatile
as the real thing

201
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,512
but a fraction of the cost.

202
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,234
(Pealy) This item was a lot of fun.

203
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,518
From - where else? - Japan.

204
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,272
(Slurping)

205
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,153
Ahh...

206
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,399
But perhaps the most controversial
item at Foodex was this.

207
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,111
A substance known as SP4053.

208
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,313
It's a modified elephant gene
that can be added to pigswill

209
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,750
to create oversized pigs.

210
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,555
The makers claim that these
Ele-swine, as they call them,

211
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,069
could yield massive amounts of meat.

212
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,549
However, some scientists
are urging caution.

213
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,480
Because such a beast would have
a bigger brain than humans

214
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,831
they might be reluctant
to be turned into sausages

215
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,157
and may be inclined
to settle a few old scores.

216
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,396
Certainly food for thought.

217
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,477
Earlier we showed you our pick of
the future of food exhibition Foodex

218
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,718
but we saved the real
star of the show until now.

219
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,992
So please welcome to Look Around
You, Teddy Clarke.

220
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,392
- Hello.
- Hello there.

221
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,116
Now it's not actually you
who's the star, is it?

222
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,392
No, it's these chaps over here,
my vegetables.

223
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,878
Let's take a look. Believe me,
these aren't just any old vegetables

224
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,709
because this is the world's only
vegetable orchestra.

225
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,194
That's right.

226
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,709
Well, how do you make a vegetable
make music?

227
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,117
Well, everything, as you know,
is made up of cells

228
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,356
and vegetables are no different.

229
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,474
These cells vibrate
at different frequencies

230
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:42,754
and by controlling these frequencies
using variable voltages

231
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,111
and a suitable amplification
system...

232
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,152
- Which you have here.
- Yes.

233
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,274
Let's have a look at it. Now,
it does look rather complicated.

234
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,917
- It's not too complicated actually.
- Is that a Beaumont Grill?

235
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,872
It is a Beaumont Grille,

236
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:04,200
and this whole system amplifies
the minutest vibration,

237
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,597
so we can make them sound like
any musical instrument.

238
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:12,157
Talk us through the various sections
of the orchestra. What are these?

239
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,476
- Tomatoes.
- And what instrument?

240
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,958
The first violins. Those are
the corn - that's the violas -

241
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,914
and up there are the leeks -
they're the trumpets.

242
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,237
And the spring onions there,
they're the timpani.

243
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,240
- And what about this big fellow?
- The onion is the woodblock.

244
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,398
- And the peas?
- The peas are the flutes.

245
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,035
And this pea here
is a very good mimic

246
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,118
and he sometimes doubles up
for the bassoon.

247
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,517
So how do you get them
to learn a piece of music?

248
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,270
It's pretty simple actually.
We sit the vegetables in a mulch

249
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,553
made of the sheet music of
the piece that I'm teaching them.

250
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,038
Fascinating! Last night Teddy Clarke
and the Vegetable Orchestra

251
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,754
performed at the Royal Albert Hall,

252
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,554
and there was
a very special guest there?

253
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,353
Mm, that's right.

254
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,110
We were honoured to perform in front
of Sherlock Holmes's grandson.

255
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,119
(Jack) And did you get
a chance to meet him?

256
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,516
No, he had another engagement.

257
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,951
Well, I'm dying to hear
your vegetables in action,

258
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,959
so please tell us,
what will you be playing?

259
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,276
Well, we'll be playing...

260
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:25,076
the introduction from
the BBC Nine O'Clock News.

261
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,353
Well, take it away - Teddy Clarke
and the Vegetable Orchestra.

262
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,594
(â™ª "Classical" version of
BBC Nine O'Clock News theme)

263
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,036
(Bell chimes)

264
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,912
(Applause)

265
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,316
(Jack) Bravo!
(Pealy) Marvellous!

266
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,910
- Well done.
- Teddy, when are you playing next?

267
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,397
- Sunday, in Lake Windermere.
- In Lake Windermere?

268
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,639
They'll empty it before the
performance and fill it again after.

269
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,230
Well, Teddy wins our
invention of the week nomination

270
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,397
for his vegetable orchestra.

271
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,511
And here's your rosette.

272
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:41,112
And we'll see Teddy again at the end
of the series for our live final

273
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,039
when he could win
this magnificent trophy,

274
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,710
presented by His Royal Highness,
Sir Prince Charles.

275
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,037
I'm now outside Big C, the world's
first automated casserole cafe.

276
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,552
It's opening night but before then
managing director Clive Pounds

277
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,480
is giving Look Around You
an exclusive look inside.

278
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,751
Have you made a reservation, sir?

279
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,792
I'm only kidding. Come in.

280
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,877
Now, Clive, when you enter Big C

281
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,754
you immediately notice
that there are no staff.

282
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,874
It may seem a bit eerie but all
will be explained. Take a seat.

283
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,310
Oh, thank you.

284
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,717
Well, the first thing I do
is choose my casserole.

285
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,840
Hm. I think I'll go for the beef.

286
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,678
Waiter!

287
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,396
Ah, silly me, there are no waiters.
No problem.

288
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,793
I simply write down my order
on this sheet of A4 paper.

289
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,796
Now for the clever bit.

290
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,556
Clive, tell us what happens now.

291
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,240
OK, so now you...
Oh, good choice, sir.

292
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,240
Pop your order into the fax machine,
like so.

293
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,590
Punch in the number of the kitchen.

294
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,393
(Beeps)

295
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,798
Now that sound informs you that
the kitchen is awaiting your order.

296
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,800
One beef casserole for table nine.

297
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,111
(Peter) The computer calculates the
precise amount of casserole I need

298
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:57,030
before sending an electronic signal
to the automated collection pipe.

299
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,237
- And a few moments later...
- (Bell dings)

300
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,272
(Beeping)

301
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,872
(Beeping)

302
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,112
No fuss, just piping hot casserole.

303
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,278
How's your casserole?

304
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,118
Mm, delicious.

305
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,311
Let's hope the customers
think so too.

306
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,750
We'll find out at the grand opening.

307
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,837
Yeah. Fingers crossed.

308
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,952
Well, unfortunately
there never was an opening night.

309
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,356
Only hours after that piece
was filmed

310
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,313
Clive Pounds sadly died

311
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,718
from complications following
a wasp sting to his anus.

312
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,155
And so, as a mark of respect,

313
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,591
we will now observe
a one-second silence.

314
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,750
(Beep)

315
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,677
Well, it's Pam's birthday,

316
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,760
and as promised we're throwing
a futuristic party for her.

317
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,190
And of course, you're all invited.

318
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,237
(All) Happy birthday!

319
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,920
- Immenstrades!
- Immenstrades!

320
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,634
(Jack) This chicken wine's
delicious.

321
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,751
Thank you, everyone. Oh, my cake.

322
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,156
We managed to salvage most of it.

323
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,590
- (Laughter)
- Go on, make a wish.

324
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,032
(All) Hooray!

325
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,200
Well, Pam, we have a surprise
for you now - a very special guest.

326
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,154
- Who is it?
- Somebody you know extremely well.

327
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,750
Probably you better know than
anybody else in the world.

328
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,599
My mother? My doctor?

329
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,438
Now, Pam, no guessing.

330
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,030
This guest represents
a breakthrough in science.

331
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,790
In fact, some of the leading names
in physics and biology

332
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,720
have been working with
Look Around You on a secret project.

333
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,871
So may we have a drum roll, please.

334
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,516
(Drum roll)

335
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:32,795
Pam Bachelor, please welcome
your surprise birthday guest.

336
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,558
It's yourself - Pam Bachelor -

337
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,637
at age 90.

338
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,159
Now, first of all, Pam,
I have to tell you

339
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,717
that you mustn't touch your
older self, for obvious reasons.

340
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,194
OK.

341
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,672
- Well, say hello.
- Hello.

342
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,154
Hello.

343
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,356
- How are you?
- You mean "how am I"?

344
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,392
We're the same person.

345
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,638
Oh, yes. What happened to your eye?

346
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,673
- It's your eye too, dear.
- Sorry.

347
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,280
Well, you lose it in an accident

348
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,676
and they replace it
with this nuclear one.

349
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,110
It's rather good, actually - look.

350
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,839
- (Chuckles)
- (Young Pam) My!

351
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,679
- Your husband never liked it.
- Husband?

352
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,236
First husband,
because you remarried three times.

353
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,839
Three times?

354
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,951
Connecticut doesn't work out
for you.

355
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,153
And then there's the fire and
the investigation and everything.

356
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,399
Anyway, the point is, it's your
birthday - it's our birthday -

357
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,160
so happy birthday from the future.

358
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,192
Thank you very much, Pam...

359
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,110
Seeing myself reminds me how happy
and surprised I was on this day.

360
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,120
Well, thank you very much,
Pam Bachelor from the future.

361
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:13,074
Unfortunately that's all
we've got time for tonight.

362
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,079
Pam, we hope you've had
a fantastic birthday.

363
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,760
It's been the best birthday ever.

364
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,599
And special thanks
to the Human Dustbin,

365
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,950
who's raised L14,000

366
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,198
for the relatives of the victims
of the Battle of Hastings.

367
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:32,360
Thanks also to Teddy Clarke and
the Vegetable Symphony Orchestra,

368
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,757
and of course to
Slimmer of the Year Andy Gough.

369
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,439
Thanks, Andy.

370
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,358
Thandy.

371
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,076
Next week it's time
to get plugged in

372
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,715
as we take a look at
the world of computers.

373
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,955
So don't miss it.

374
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,800
So from both Pams and all of us here
at Shepherd's Bush,

375
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,357
take care of yourself, and remember,
wherever you are, whatever you do...

376
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,676
(â™ª Piano introduction)

377
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,077
â™ª Happy birthday to you

378
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,991
â™ª Happy birthday to you

379
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:13,637
â™ª Happy birthday dear Pam

380
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,912
â™ª Happy birthday to you

381
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,954
â™ª Birthdays are a time
for celebration

382
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,040
â™ª A time when all around you
is good cheer

383
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,393
â™ª So please all raise your glass
and hearty may you laugh

384
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,957
â™ª And toast this merry fellow
that is here

385
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,391
â™ª Happy birthday to you

386
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,192
â™ª Happy birthday to you

387
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:46,713
â™ª Happy birthday dear Pams

388
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,754
â™ª From Look Around You â™ª

389
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,838
- (â™ª Theme tune)
- (Pealy) Happy birthday.

390
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,192
â™ª Look Around You â™ª

391
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,952
Viewers may be pleased to know

392
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,313
that Clive Pounds, who died
during the making of that programme,

393
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,352
has since come back to life.
