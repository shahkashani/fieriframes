1
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,390
Look around you.

2
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,357
Look around you.

3
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,755
Just look around you.

4
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,352
There.

5
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,830
Now take a closer look.

6
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,000
Have you worked out
what we're looking for?

7
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,472
Correct. The answer is...

8
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,432
This programme, "Calcium",
follows last week's module,

9
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,559
and will complete part one
of your textbook,

10
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,797
which accompanies this series.

11
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,997
Please ensure that you have
your copybook at hand,

12
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,471
as you'll be asked to take down
notes from the screen

13
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,030
at various points
throughout the programme.

14
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,513
Calcium.

15
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,594
You may know it as "Ginny"
or "Ninny", or "Peter's Peg".

16
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,911
But whatever you call it,

17
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,152
calcium, valency 1,
atomic weight 44,

18
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,553
is one of the most important
elements known to mankind.

19
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,953
As we have seen, calcium
occurs naturally within the tooth.

20
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,837
Thus, man's very existence

21
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,959
is inextricably linked
to the white element.

22
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,791
Without calcium, man would be
unable to process foods

23
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,240
and would starve.

24
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,072
In this programme, we will attempt
to show the many uses of calcium,

25
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,119
as well as a number of experiments.

26
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,512
An experiment was carried out

27
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,838
to ascertain whether calcium
is soluble in water.

28
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,950
First, a quantity of calcium
was obtained.

29
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,755
Using a mortar and pestle, the
calcium is ground into a fine dust.

30
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,557
The chalky dust
is poured into a beaker.

31
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,672
Next, the beaker is placed
under a running tap.

32
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,353
You can use distilled water,
but be aware of the cost.

33
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,157
The calcium-water mixture
is agitated

34
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,080
using a glass rod or pencil.

35
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,952
It is then allowed
to settle for a while.

36
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,231
So, is calcium soluble?

37
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,872
Look closely
before making your decision.

38
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,557
Have you observed the chalky
deposit at the base of the beaker?

39
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,953
If you have, then you'll have
reached the conclusion that...

40
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,910
There is a reason for this.

41
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,112
Can you work out what it is?

42
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,320
Correct.

43
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,633
If calcium were soluble, our teeth
would be open to corrosion

44
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,435
through daily contact with saliva.

45
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,833
Again, man would be unable
to process foods

46
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,310
and would starve.

47
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,110
Here is a model
of a calcium molecule.

48
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,920
Do you recognise the triple helix?

49
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,039
If you do, write it down.

50
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,279
The calcium molecule is built
on a semi-permanent structure

51
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,320
of four electrons
supporting three protons.

52
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,477
The protons feed
electrical information

53
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,717
to the core of the molecule,

54
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,669
where we find the central atom,
or "queen atom".

55
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,837
Were the queen atom
to leave the molecule, or "nest",

56
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,191
the effects would be disastrous,

57
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,400
as the entire structure
would come tumbling down.

58
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,238
This is known as
the Helvetica Scenario.

59
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,234
(HIGH-PITCHED BUZZING)

60
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,512
Luckily, Helvetica
is a very, very rare occurrence.

61
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,913
The Staffordshire Downs,

62
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,437
200 square miles
of rolling countryside.

63
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,597
It's here, amongst the jewel
of the north-west,

64
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,594
that we can observe
calcium in action.

65
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,880
Holdwick Park Refinery

66
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,359
has been producing industrial
strength calcium for over 20 years.

67
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,910
Chances are, if you've ever
written with a calcium nib,

68
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,394
or peered through a calcium lens,
they probably came from Holdwick.

69
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,392
Let's step inside.

70
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,950
Have your copybooks ready.

71
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,755
Every day, six tons of discarded
teeth and bones are brought here.

72
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,596
They're collected from calcic
drop-off points around Britain.

73
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,231
You may have seen one
in your town or village.

74
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,910
Because calcium perspires,

75
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,356
by the time it reaches Holdwick,

76
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,200
there's a lot of water
to be removed.

77
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,151
The teeth and bones
are poured into giant canisters,

78
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,711
and any excess run-off
is filtered away.

79
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,276
The dried calcium is then
pumped along these pipes.

80
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,670
When it reaches this trough,
a kind of glorified Bestal Heim,

81
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,392
it's bombarded with millions
and millions of caesium atoms.

82
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,519
This process compresses
the calcium into a viscous paste.

83
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,991
The calcic paste
is then heated in giant ovens

84
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,716
to 12,000 BC
before being left to cool.

85
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,035
From six tons of raw material,

86
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,031
and nearly 900 man hours later,
here are the results:

87
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,319
some twelve ounces
of pure industrial calcium.

88
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,032
This is then stored
in an underground lead chamber

89
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,159
to prevent the possibility
of Helvetica.

90
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,233
(HIGH-PITCHED BUZZING)

91
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,517
Now let's look at some of the ways
in which calcium is used.

92
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,673
Have your pen and paper ready.

93
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,715
Calcium can be used
to make powerful adhesives.

94
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,677
It's also used
as a strengthening agent

95
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,031
in bridges...

96
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,957
..windows...

97
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,758
..and was pivotal in the
development of Imsimil Berati-Lahn.

98
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,952
(BUZZES)

99
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,720
Calcium also occurs naturally
in liquid form.

100
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,789
You'll know it as milk.

101
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,911
In the Jewish religion,

102
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,120
it is forbidden to eat
milk and meat at the same meal.

103
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,149
Foods that contain dairy products
are referred to as "milchig".

104
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,911
Milchig.

105
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,872
Write that in your copybook now.

106
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,678
An experiment was carried out

107
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,920
to determine whether calcium
is a conductor of electricity.

108
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,835
First, a simple electrical circuit
is constructed.

109
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,519
The negative terminal
of a 9-volt battery

110
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,675
is connected to one end
of a Bestal Heim plate.

111
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,076
The other end of the Bestal Heim
is connected via an electrical lamp

112
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,356
to the positive terminal.

113
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,035
Now for the calcium.

114
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,231
A quantity is gently poured
into the Bestal Heim,

115
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,359
making sure that it forms
an unbroken line

116
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:47,151
between the negative and
positive end of the Bestal Heim.

117
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,674
If calcium conducts electricity,

118
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,437
the circuit will become complete
and the lamp will light.

119
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,279
Sadly, the lamp does not light.

120
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,957
From the results of this
experiment, we can conclude that...

121
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,431
Now let's see what happens

122
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,956
when we introduce
some sodium chloride.

123
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,033
You'll recognise it as common salt.

124
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,676
Let's take a look at the lamp now.

125
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,677
The calcium has reacted
with the sodium chloride

126
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,072
to produce calcium chloride.

127
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,554
Because calcium chloride is a
conductor, the little lamp lights.

128
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:50,074
Small quantities of Thomason's oil,
segnomin, are also produced.

129
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,235
Little wonder that calcium chloride

130
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,070
is used to power amplifiers
for electric guitars.

131
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,151
When calcium is burned,

132
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,552
calcium oxide is released
as a vapour.

133
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,472
Although not toxic,

134
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,192
if inhaled, this vapour can cause
temporary bodily paralysis.

135
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:24,519
For centuries magicians have used
calcium to simulate levitation.

136
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,590
This principle can be demonstrated
in the laboratory.

137
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,596
An experiment was carried out

138
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,515
to observe the effects
of helium gas upon calcium.

139
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,391
A pyramid of powdered calcium
is formed upon a work surface.

140
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,236
Next, an ordinary ping-pong ball

141
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,672
is placed carefully
on top of the pyramid.

142
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,193
Now we mark the mid-point.

143
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,275
Then helium gas is released
in the vicinity of the pyramid.

144
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,511
As our starting pressure,

145
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,594
we're using Cinderford's constant
of 2.5 quorums per second.

146
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:23,075
Observe the reaction and note
the results down in your copybook.

147
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:33,277
The pyramid of powdered calcium
has disappeared. Or has it?

148
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,110
The calcium seems to have moved

149
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,836
some eight inches away
from its original location.

150
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,477
Eight inches.

151
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,680
So, what's keeping
the ping-pong ball aloft?

152
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,355
Surprisingly, the pyramid
of powdered calcium is still there.

153
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,394
Only its image has moved.

154
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:13,158
This phenomenon is known as
Calcic Image Misplacement, or CIM.

155
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,155
Turn off the helium supply

156
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,996
and the image of the pyramid
of powdered calcium

157
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,836
is reunited with the actual pyramid
of powdered calcium.

158
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,757
Now let's see what happens

159
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,955
when we increase the flow
of helium by a factor of 5 qps.

160
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,514
The pyramid's image
fades as before.

161
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:46,278
This time it reappears
some 11.5 inches away.

162
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,751
11.5. Write that down.

163
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,118
Now we try a factor of 7.

164
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,440
This time,

165
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,879
the image of the calcic pyramid
appears over 500 miles away.

166
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,951
We've talked a lot about calcium
atomic weight 44.

167
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:27,275
But what of its sister element,
calcium atomic weight 42,

168
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,756
or intelligent calcium?

169
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,752
Intelligent calcium

170
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,516
is not intelligent in the sense
that you or I are intelligent,

171
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,673
but intelligent
in that it is sentient,

172
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:44,472
ie, it is aware of itself
and its surroundings.

173
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,280
In the laboratory,

174
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,433
scientists can communicate
with intelligent calcium

175
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,638
using a REMS Oscillating Converter.

176
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,871
The REMS measures
tiny chemical impulses

177
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,112
from within samples
of intelligent calcium.

178
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,312
An experiment was carried out

179
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,555
to demonstrate the cognitive
properties of intelligent calcium.

180
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,950
The REMS is connected
via its two thin probes

181
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,153
to the sample
of intelligent calcium.

182
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,396
Once the microphone is in place,
we turn on the REMS.

183
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,796
Get ready to take down
readings from the screen.

184
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,715
The scientist issues
interrogative statements

185
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,560
to the intelligent calcium
through the REMS,

186
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,519
which measures its response.

187
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,435
What is your atomic weight?

188
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,193
It can take a few moments
for the sample to respond.

189
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,911
The scientist repeats the question.

190
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,275
What is your atomic weight?

191
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,437
There we are. F...

192
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,679

O.

199
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,751
Forty-two.

200
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,997
Where are you?

201
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,357
I... N...

202

B... E.

207
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,915
In a test tube.

208
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,356
How do you feel?

209
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,271
C...

210
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,919
O...

211
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,400
L...

212
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,880
D.

213
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,316
Cold.

214
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,159
Now watch what happens

215
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,513
when we deprive
the intelligent calcium of oxygen.

216
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,996
The intelligent calcium
is completely neutralised.

217
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,592
Note that down
in your copybook now.

218
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,838
Over the course of this module,
we've learned a lot

219
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,032
about the nature,

220
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,112
manufacture

221
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,749
and uses of the white element.

222
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,634
But remember,
whether you're at home,

223
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:43,357
in school, or just out and about,
whatever you do,

224
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,274
never give a gypsy calcium.

225
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:53,233
Now hand in your copybooks
to your teacher or head of class.

226
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,434
In the next programme,
we will look at champagne.
