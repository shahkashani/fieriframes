1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:07,116
And now on BBC2, it's time to take
our weekly look into the future,

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,871
as we join Peter, Jack, Pam and
Pealy in London's Shepherd's Bush

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,914
for tonight's edition of
Look Around You.

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,598
Hello. Coming up
on tonight's programme...

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,635
we'll be unveiling
a brand-new sport.

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,114
We'll also be hosting
a unique sporting event,

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,959
right here in the studio, whoa!

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,674
And attempting to break
a world record.

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,794
That's all on tonight's
sporting edition of Look Around You.

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,399
Take it away, Brian.

11
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,356
♪ Look Around You ♪

12
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,029
(Commentator)
Oh, would you look at this!

13
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,472
Charging through the competition
with an incredible burst of energy,

14
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,477
Ros Lamb, the Southport Sparrow,

15
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,037
surges through to become
the world 400,000 metres champion!

16
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,916
There she is, being congratulated by
her husband and trainer, Ron Lamb,

17
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,160
Oh! She's overcome so much,
this girl, to get here today,

18
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,877
and now, brave Ros Lamb
is the pride of Roast Britain!

19
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,950
Wow!

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,640
Who can forget
that incredible victory?

21
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,036
- So inspirational!
- Fantastic!

22
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,551
And here she is to tell us about
a remarkable breakthrough

23
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,637
in running technology - Ros Lamb.

24
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,673
- Ros, welcome to Look Around You.
- Hello.

25
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,916
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Hi, Ros, hello.

26
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,072
- It's lovely to meet you.
- Hello.

27
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,875
Now, Ros, first of all,
congratulations once again.

28
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,593
Thanks.

29
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,393
You've brought your medal
to show us.

30
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,840
I have, yeah.

31
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,153
(Gasps)

32
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,157
- It's beautiful.
- Well done.

33
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,200
Now, Ros has run some pretty
impressive distances in her career,

34
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,792
but now she's able to run further,
and much faster than ever before.

35
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,400
And it's all thanks to this -

36
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,593
a serum, known as
di-tutetamine brohohibe.

37
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,518
Ros, tell us a bit about it.

38
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,555
Well, di-tutetamine brohohibe
is a new form of rocket fuel.

39
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,000
- Rocket fuel?
- Yeah.

40
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,430
Which has been flavoured
with caramel.

41
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,678
And there's also a savoury version,
available soon.

42
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,509
- It's been adapted for human use?
- Yeah, that's right, yeah

43
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,315
Now, Ros, tell us, what speed
can an average runner achieve?

44
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,480
Well, er, an Olympic sprinter
can reach about 20 miles an hour.

45
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,230
And how fast can you run using
di-tutetamine brohohibe?

46
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,231
About three and a half thousand
miles an hour, give or take.

47
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,112
Well, that's a pretty big increase.

48
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,914
Well, we're really going to put Ros
to the test now,

49
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,590
because we've devised a special
Look Around You challenge for her.

50
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,555
Ros is going to attempt
to run from here,

51
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,796
BBC Television Centre in London,

52
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,560
all the way to our studio
in Aberdeen,

53
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,719
where she'll be met by BBC
Scotland's Mario Abdullah-Levy.

54
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,480
- Hello Mario!
- Hello Peter!

55
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,752
Mario, tell us, just how far away
are you up there?

56
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,589
Well, we're 524 miles away
from Shepherd's Bush,

57
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,030
so it's a fair old distance.

58
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,517
And I have to tell you, Ros, that
it's absolutely freezing up here.

59
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,200
And although
I'd love to see it myself,

60
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,472
I hope you're not wearing anything
too skimpy!

61
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,877
(Laughs) Thanks Mario. Now, Ros
reckons she can run the distance

62
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,991
in just under five minutes.

63
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,315
Five minutes, yeah.

64
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,159
Well, you might want
a look at this first.

65
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,590
Thanks, I think I know the way.

66
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,312
Well, best of luck!

67
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,390
Ros is just taking
her di-tutetamine brohohibe.

68
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,719
And now we'll just wait
for the serum to take its effect.

69
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,070
(Heartbeat)

70
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,030
(Jet engine)

71
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,356
Ah! Oh!

72
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,597
Whoa!

73
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,871
Eddie! Eddie!

74
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,917
Mario! Thanks Eddie!

75
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,079
Mario, hopefully we'll see
you and Ros in about five minutes.

76
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,157
I can't quite hear
what you're saying,

77
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,238
but hopefully Ros and I will see you
in about five minutes.

78
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,471
And it's neck and neck for Grandma's
Ghost and Victim of Circumstance,

79
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,671
but he's having none of it.

80
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,350
And it's a mighty win
for Victim of Circumstance.

81
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,590
Another 50 quid down the drain.

82
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,672
Most of us enjoy a good flutter
every now and then,

83
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,713
but perhaps not the heartache
of losing.

84
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,639
So a system that could predict
the winner every time

85
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,516
would be a very attractive, not
to mention lucrative, proposition.

86
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,598
There are a number of betting
systems around at the moment,

87
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,711
the most famous being
the Lombard system,

88
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,956
which is not particularly reliable,

89
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,310
and is also quite tricky to use.

90
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,639
But now, there's a new system

91
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,754
that's said to be 100 per cent
accurate at predicting the winner.

92
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,350
And to hear about it, we have to go
straight to the horse's mouth.

93
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,110
That's because its inventor is,
in fact, a horse.

94
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,631
Please welcome Championess
and her owner, Paul Alan.

95
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,120
Whoa! Hey.

96
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,992
- Welcome, both of you.
- Hello.

97
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,599
Now, Paul,

98
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,520
Championess actually designed the
betting system - how did she do it?

99
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,476
Well, erm, I first noticed that
she was up to something when, er,

100
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,116
she locked herself away
in her stable for about six months.

101
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,040
Erm, occasionally I'd hear
the odd banging noise,

102
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,790
erm, but I just thought,
"Best leave her to it, really".

103
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,995
One day the stable doors were flung
open and there was her machine.

104
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,509
- And this is it.
- Yes.

105
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,031
She made it from stuff she found
lying around her stable.

106
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,592
And, as you can see, it's all
held together with her manure.

107
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,632
I see.

108
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,356
Sorry, animals and children,
they say, don't they? There we go.

109
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,234
- Indeed. Yes.
- And how does it work?

110
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,399
I tell her the names of the horses,
don't I, darling? That's right.

111
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:41,276
I tell her the names of the horses,
and the odds, the form...

112
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,951
- Come forward a little bit.
- ..maybe the size of the jockeys.

113
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,471
Then she types all the information
into her machine with her hoof.

114
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,716
- I see. Right, yeah.
- Yeah.

115
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,320
And then, a little bit later,
she gets the result.

116
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,195
She's been doing pretty well
from it, haven't you, darling?

117
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,234
Now, Championess has won 60,000
guineas this season alone.

118
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,318
And, Paul, may I ask,
what does she spend her winnings on?

119
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,829
Oh, the usual things -

120
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,476
hay, a new saddle,
carrots, sugar lumps.

121
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,833
I suppose the only luxury
she's allowed herself was a Jacuzzi.

122
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,430
But she only got in it the once.
I don't think she liked the bubbles!

123
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,470
Right.

124
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,433
Well, we're going to try out
Championess's system,

125
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,153
right here on the programme.

126
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,873
(Laughs) Pongo!

127
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,755
Obviously there's not enough room in
the studio for a live horse race,

128
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,271
is there, Championess?
So, we've got the next best thing -

129
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,312
ants.

130
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,276
And we'll be holding our very own
Look Around You Ant Derby later on,

131
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,075
which should give Championess just
enough time to study the runners.

132
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,271
We can now go back to BBC Scotland
and rejoin Mario Abdullah-Levy.

133
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,551
- Hello, Peter
- Hello, Mario.

134
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,398
Any sign of Ros Lamb?

135
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,990
Not yet, Peter, but we're
expecting her any second now.

136
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,839
- (Whooshing)
- In fact I can just hear....

137
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,476
She's arrived! She's here!
Stop the clock.

138
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,194
Four minutes
and twenty-eight seconds.

139
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:15,237
And that smashes the previous record
of 22 days, 3 hours and 15 minutes.

140
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,274
That's a new world record.
So Ros, how are you feeling?

141
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:27,551
Ros is understandably pretty well
worn out after her 524-mile run.

142
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,640
And as you can see, she's quite
a bit smaller than when she started.

143
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,718
That's due to a massive increase
in her body temperature

144
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,958
from travelling
at such a great speed.

145
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,598
And now, back to Peter Packard
at Television Centre.

146
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,757
Thanks, Mario. Yes, outstanding.

147
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,792
Hopefully we'll be hearing from Ros

148
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,230
once she's had a chance
to catch her breath.

149
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,559
Now, question - what do these
four footballers have in common?

150
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,190
Think you know?

151
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,880
Well, the obvious answer
is that they're all deaf,

152
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,834
but you may not know that they
all had footballs made for them

153
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,236
by one of soccer's unsung heroes -

154
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,194
the world's greatest football
designer, Sebastian Jackson.

155
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,395
During his career, Sebastian Jackson
produced some of the most innovative

156
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,035
and ingenious footballs ever,

157
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,198
including the controversial
Invisiball.

158
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,913
Jackson himself
was a flamboyant figure,

159
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,034
and was linked romantically
to a string of glamorous women,

160
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,391
including Marilyn Monroe's sister,
Margaret.

161
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,638
Unfortunately, Sebastian Jackson
passed away last year,

162
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,878
after swallowing a pin. He was 62.

163
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,752
However, with typical flair,

164
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,395
he took the precaution
of creating several copies,

165
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,238
or clones, of himself
before he died.

166
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,637
And we're very lucky to be joined
by one of them tonight -

167
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,911
please welcome Provastian Jackson.

168
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,800
- Hello, Jack.
- Hello, welcome to Look Around You.

169
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,039
You're an exact copy of the original
Sebastian Jackson, aren't you?

170
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,993
- Yes, I am.
- And how many of you are there?

171
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,953
Well, there's Ninastian, Compastian,

172
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,437
Hairhastain, Fantastian,
Clilthrastian,

173
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,712
and Torvartian,
who's our leader in a way.

174
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,229
I understand Ninastian
is with us tonight.

175
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,431
Yes, he is, he's over there.

176
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,917
- He's a little camera-shy.
- Oh well. Now, Provastian,

177
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,636
there haven't been any Jackson
footballs in the shops for a while.

178
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,478
No, but me and the other copycats

179
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,557
have been busy developing
a new range.

180
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,799
Let's take a look. Now, this first
football here, I have to say -

181
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,957
I'm not the best at football
by the way -

182
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,516
looks like any football
I might find lying about my garage.

183
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,873
Yes, it does look pretty ordinary,
I agree, but if you look at the top,

184
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,560
just press that button.

185
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,759
So, when you want to put it away,

186
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,520
it'Il fit neatly on your shelf
without rolling off.

187
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,040
We call it a footcube.

188
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,275
How does it work?

189
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,711
It's a mixture of pistons, springs
and Gary Bonds, very clever.

190
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,719
It is clever.
Now, this one over here,

191
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,879
please don't take this the wrong
way, but it does smell a bit.

192
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,196
- Pongo!
- Pongo!

193
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,550
This is our meat-ball,
made from meat scraps

194
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,910
which would otherwise
just be thrown away.

195
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,112
It gently decomposes
during the course of the match.

196
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,992
So it's ecologically friendly.

197
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,317
Yes. Best not to use it in hot
weather - gets covered in maggots.

198
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,794
And it's all meat?

199
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,752
Well, there's a bit of cod
in this one.

200
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,316
Now, this jolly chap over here,
what is this?

201
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,272
- This is a piggyball.
- Piggyball?

202
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,597
Piggyball. You can see the slit
in the top.

203
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,518
- Mm-hm.
- (Coins jingle)

204
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,472
Used mainly for charity matches.

205
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,672
Now, this last one
looks extremely intriguing.

206
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,871
Just over here.

207
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,993
Well, this is our principal project
at the moment.

208
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,475
Its, erm...

209
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,716
Well, we... We've...

210
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,230
Do you know? Ninastian knows more
about this one than I do.

211
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,670
- OK.
- Ninastian.

212
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,160
Ninny, come on, Ninny!

213
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,877
(Jack) Well, I think we're going
to meet Ninastian Jackson now.

214
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,110
- Hello, Ninastian.
- Hello.

215
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,159
Tell him about it.

216
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,989
Oh, in order to create
a more aerdo...

217
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,431
aerodynamic football,
we designed an object

218
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:53,798
which is about 250 times more round
than a normal ball.

219
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,995
So what you're saying is you've
managed to out-round the sphere.

220
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,159
Unfortunately, we can't show
the football for legal reasons,

221
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,556
so I'll just have
to describe it to you.

222
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,150
Just please be careful you don't
pull the curtain back too far.

223
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,192
Don't worry.

224
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,590
Cor! That is extraordinary!
That is just so...round.

225
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,151
Well, the only way I can attempt
to describe it is,

226
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,479
if you can try to imagine a perfect
circle, and then round it out,

227
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,512
so that it's even rounder...

228
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,679
That is extraordinary. When can
we expect to see this in the shops?

229
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,837
Oh, that's a moot point actually,

230
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,556
because currently it's illegal
to sell it in this country,

231
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,115
as it does contain
a working human heart.

232
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,756
(Both) So It's only on sale in
Germany at the moment, I'm afraid.

233
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,474
Well, best of luck,
Provastian and Ninastian,

234
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,752
and thank you both
for showing us your balls. Peter.

235
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,395
And I believe we can go
to BBC Scotland

236
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,478
and rejoin Mario Abdullah-Levy,

237
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,989
who is now talking with Ros Lamb.

238
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,838
Ros, that was a terrific run,

239
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,430
London to Aberdeen in four and a
half minutes, a new world record.

240
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,278
(Squeaky voice) Thanks, yeah.

241
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,720
What happened to your forehead?

242
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,559
I ran into a parking meter
in Kilburn.

243
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,956
So after that
I just stuck to motorways.

244
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,514
So, a smooth journey?

245
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,634
Well, I got pulled over
a couple of times by the police.

246
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,878
- Oh really?
- Nothing serious, just a caution.

247
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,834
But in general, it was
a very good run, I'm very pleased.

248
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,395
Well, Maseltov once again.

249
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,957
And now Ros Lamb will be running
back down to our studios in London,

250
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,710
so Ros, if you'd like to take
your di-tutetamine brohohibe.

251
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,832
- And best of luck!
- (Squeaky voice) Thanks!

252
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,032
(Jet engine rumbles)

253
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,072
(Heartbeat)

254
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,272
Dougal!

255
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,278
And back to you, Peter,
at Shepherd's Bush.

256
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,070
When the Olympics take place next
year in Swansea Industrial Park,

257
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,715
there'll be a record number
of new events

258
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,558
which have been formally accepted

259
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,115
by the Olympic Committee
and Swansea Council.

260
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,632
In fact there are a staggering
22 brand-new Olympic sports,

261
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,151
but there's one sport
everyone wants to play.

262
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:57,117
So Look Around You sent Pealy Maghti
off to our sister country, America,

263
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,834
to try it out.

264
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,512
(♪ Pounding rock music)

265
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,320
(Pealy) Pennsylvania, USA.

266
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,400
When you think of Pennsylvania,
you probably think of pencils.

267
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,798
But in America, Pennsylvania
is best known for its baseball team,

268
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,957
the Pennsylvania Pippins.

269
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,992
And every Monday and Wednesday,

270
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,557
thousands of fans flock to see such
baseball legends as TJ Nottingham,

271
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,193
Sonny Thompson,

272
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,596
and Xythantiops.

273
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,520
But it's not just baseball that's
put Pennsylvania on the map.

274
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,950
Jogging recently
became compulsory here,

275
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,394
with stiff penalties for anyone who
doesn't fulfil the weekly mileage.

276
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,671
But now,
there's a new sport in town,

277
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,999
which may be about to take
the state, and the world, by storm.

278
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,636
So I caught up with its inventor,
Scott Nolan.

279
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,832
This sport you've created
isn't completely new, is it?

280
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,031
Not exactly, Pealy, no.

281
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,120
You see, I wanted to combine key
aspects of my two favourite sports,

282
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,153
into a new hybrid, or combo-sport,

283
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,998
which I believe has the potential

284
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,272
to become the most exciting
spectator sport at the Olympics.

285
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,755
What are the two sports
that you've combined?

286
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,190
Tennis and golf.

287
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,200
Well, I'm dying to try it out.
Now, am I dressed for the occasion?

288
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,039
I hope so, let's see,
you've got the shoes and the socks,

289
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,436
the pants, the hat...

290
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,951
All you need is this...
and you're all set!

291
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,632
Let's play gonnis!

292
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,673
Gonnis is a perfect mixture
of golf and tennis.

293
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,719
The rules are very simple -

294
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,720
get the ball over the net, onto the
green and into your opponent's hole,

295
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,231
whilst avoiding the bunkers
and the water hazard.

296
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,240
The game was overseen by the world's
only professional gonnis umpire,

297
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,990
Bunny Gnowles, who also happens
to be Scott's boyfriend.

298
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,238
- Go easy on me, Scott!
- Not a chance!

299
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,918
With its classy blend
of elegance and style,

300
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,998
gonnis has become the game of choice
for the jet set,

301
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:20,319
with such players as Manhattan Dave
and the Shah of Israel,

302
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,751
and Scott even had an order
for 40,000 gonnis sets

303
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,998
from none other than Tony Curtis.

304
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,598
Quiet, please!

305
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,074
Birdie-love.

306
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,318
- I'm getting the hang of this!
- We'll see about that.

307
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,915
Out! Quiet, please!

308
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,440
Eagle - 15.

309
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,472
(Softly) Come on, Scott, come on.

310
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,880
- Advantage, Miss Maghti.
- Go on, Pealy!

311
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,877
- Quiet, please!
- Go on, Pealy!

312
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,072
Tensions ran high,
both on and off the court.

313
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,351
Ma'am, did you not hear me
say "quiet" then?

314
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,551
It's (bleep) off-putting
to the players,

315
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,150
it's (bleep) off-putting to the
opponent who you're not rooting for,

316
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,431
it's a (bleep) for him and for me!

317
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,837
And if you continue, I'm gonna
(bleep) remove you from the court.

318
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,076
Do you understand? Thank you.

319
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,357
(Bleep)

320
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,240
Miss Maghti, you are four under par.

321
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,794
Finally, it was time for me to put
my putting skills to the test.

322
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,959
- (Woman) Go on, Pealy!
- (Bleep)

323
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,189
Hole, set and match, Pealy Maghti.

324
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,678
I'd done it! Against all odds, I'd
beaten the American at his own game.

325
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,031
- That was fantastic!
- Yes, beginner's luck.

326
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,510
Miss Maghti, congratulations.
You played a good game.

327
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,479
Quiet, please.

328
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,113
Quiet, please.

329
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,391
Where now for Scott Nolan?

330
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,592
I'm developing another combo-sport
at the moment.

331
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,871
Again, it's a mixture
of two other sports -

332
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,752
fencing and darts.

333
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,596
Gosh, you were really good
at gonnis!

334
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,600
Thanks. And the funny thing is, I've
never played golf or tennis before.

335
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,758
- And I was on my period.
- Obviously a natural.

336
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,759
- Yes, well done, Pealy.
- Yeah, well played.

337
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,440
- Thanks, chaps.
- That is a beautiful trophy.

338
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,794
Well, we're just waiting for
Ros Lamb to speed into the studio

339
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,718
all the way from Aberdeen,

340
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,037
and I believe she should be here
any second now.

341
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,519
Well, while we're waiting
for Ros, erm...

342
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,918
Oh, and I believe we're now seeing
outside Television Centre,

343
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,079
where Ros Lamb should be speeding
into view any second now.

344
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,431
Erm, Jack, I believe you used to
go out with Ros Lamb, didn't you?

345
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,472
(Jack) Yes,
it was several years ago

346
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,592
and I used to fool around
with one of her sisters as well.

347
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,519
(Pealy) Not at the same time I hope!

348
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,119
(Peter) Here she is!

349
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,677
That's four minutes
and fifteen seconds.

350
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,916
That smashes her previous record,

351
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,716
by, I think, thirteen seconds,
so that's another world record.

352
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,399
- Erm, well done!
- Wow!

353
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,477
- Congratulations!
- Two in one show.

354
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,637
Well, let's go and say hello.

355
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,078
Ros, a new world record -
how do you feel?

356
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,316
(Panting)

357
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,273
(Peter) As you can see,
the run has really taken its toll,

358
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,074
there's been some further
miniaturisation.

359
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,316
Anyway, well done, Ros!

360
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,750
(Peter) What an athlete!

361
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,558
Well, now it's time
for our Look Around You Ant Derby.

362
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,592
And to tell us about the runners,

363
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,520
let's hand over to BBC's racing
commentator, Leslie Maxwell.

364
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,438
Thank you, in lane one at 5-1,

365
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,439
we have Beetleface,
looking very confident today.

366
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,678
In lane two, one of
our foremost racing ants, Mr Snips,

367
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,120
the favourite at 3-1.

368
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,879
Fancy Nancy is in lane three,

369
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,152
the going's a bit hard for her
today, I fear, she's at 7-1.

370
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,760
And finally,
the rank outsider, Nutmeg,

371
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,840
who looks like he's put on a bit of
weight recently, he's at 600-1.

372
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,280
- Back to you, Pam
- Thanks.

373
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,917
- Well, my money's on Beetleface.
- I fancy... Fancy Nancy.

374
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,670
I'm going to take a chance on
Nutmeg. How about you, Pete?

375
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,430
Yeah, me too.
And Ros, who will you be backing?

376
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,518
(High-pitched squeaking)

377
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:01,600
One pound on Mr Snips,
certainly Ros.

378
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,871
And there we are!

379
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,957
(Faint squeaking continues)

380
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,994
So, Paul, Championess has had time
to make her calculations.

381
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,077
Can we have her prediction, please?

382
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,112
(Paul) Go on, girl!

383
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,192
(Mechanical whirring)

384
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,832
- Is she finished?
- Yes.

385
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,759
So, which ant does Championess think
is going to win?

386
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,080
(Deep voice) Beetleface.

387
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,272
Beetleface!
Oh, that's my ant, great!

388
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,994
So, let's go back to Leslie
for the race.

389
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,158
Thanks, Pam. You join us
for the Look Around You Ant Derby,

390
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,271
all the ants are
at the starter's gate.

391
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,915
(Trumpet fanfare)

392
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,478
And they're off! Mr Snips
off to a good start, Nutmeg refuses,

393
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,274
Beetleface coming up,
Fancy Nancy picking up speed,

394
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,757
But it's Mr Snips and Beetleface,
they're thorax to thorax,

395
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,632
but it's Beetleface the winner!

396
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,875
- Yeah!
- Oh!

397
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,195
- Oh!
- I win!

398
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,391
- Well done!
- Bad luck, guys!

399
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,798
And well done and thank you very
much to Paul Alan and Championess.

400
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,799
And Championess and Paul Alan
go through to the final

401
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,116
of our Invention of the Year
competition

402
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,560
at the end of the series,

403
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,593
where they could win
this magnificent trophy,

404
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,271
presented by His Royal Highness
Sir Prince Charles.

405
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,313
Well, that's nearly all
we've got time for tonight.

406
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,478
Thanks to all our guests
for being such great sports.

407
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,150
- Thank you to Provastian and...
- I'm Ninastian.

408
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,160
- Oh, I beg your pardon.
- Provastian's dropped off.

409
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,476
Well, thank you to you both,

410
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:00,196
and also, of course,
thanks to Ros Lamb.

411
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,799
(Squeaks)

412
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,198
Special thanks to BBC Scotland
and Mario Abdullah-Levy.

413
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,914
And thanks to racing commentator,
Leslie Maxwell.

414
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,236
My pleasure, Pam.

415
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,718
And a special thanks to Beetleface,
Mr Snips, Fancy Nancy and Nutmeg.

416
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,672
Thanks, ants!

417
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,279
Thants.

418
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,516
Next week, we'll be taking
a tantalising look

419
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,597
at the world, and the future,
of food.

420
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,678
So make sure you make a reservation.

421
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,758
So, in the meantime, from all of us
here at Shepherd's Bush,

422
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,430
take care of yourself, and remember,
