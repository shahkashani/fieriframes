1
00:00:57,169 --> 00:01:01,833
SAGAN: All my life I've wondered
about life beyond the Earth.

2
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:06,034
On those countless other planets
that we think circle other suns...

3
00:01:06,245 --> 00:01:08,110
...is there also life?

4
00:01:08,314 --> 00:01:10,874
Might the beings of other
worlds resemble us...

5
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:13,745
...or would they be
astonishingly different?

6
00:01:13,953 --> 00:01:16,319
What would they be made of?

7
00:01:16,522 --> 00:01:18,683
In the vast Milky Way galaxy...

8
00:01:18,891 --> 00:01:22,292
...how common is what we call life?

9
00:01:24,363 --> 00:01:25,796
The nature of life on Earth...

10
00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:27,761
...and the quest for life elsewhere...

11
00:01:27,967 --> 00:01:31,095
...are the two sides
of the same question.

12
00:01:31,304 --> 00:01:34,068
The search for who we are.

13
00:01:39,145 --> 00:01:42,637
All living things on Earth
are made of organic molecules...

14
00:01:42,848 --> 00:01:45,373
...a complex microscopic
architecture...

15
00:01:45,585 --> 00:01:48,315
...built around atoms of carbon.

16
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:50,580
In the great dark between the stars...

17
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,725
...there also are organic molecules...

18
00:01:53,926 --> 00:01:57,760
...in immense clouds of gas and dust.

19
00:02:01,133 --> 00:02:02,760
Inside such clouds...

20
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:06,461
...there are batches
of new worlds just forming.

21
00:02:06,672 --> 00:02:10,608
Their surfaces are very likely
covered with organic molecules.

22
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,904
These molecules almost certainly
are not made by life...

23
00:02:14,113 --> 00:02:16,707
...although they
are the stuff of life.

24
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:20,010
On suitable worlds,
they may lead to life.

25
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:23,746
Organic matter is abundant
throughout the cosmos...

26
00:02:23,956 --> 00:02:27,722
...produced by the same chemistry
everywhere.

27
00:02:42,274 --> 00:02:44,765
Perhaps, given enough time...

28
00:02:44,977 --> 00:02:49,778
...the origin and evolution of life
is inevitable on every clement world.

29
00:02:49,982 --> 00:02:53,713
There will surely be some planets
too hostile for life.

30
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:56,615
On others,
it may arise and die out...

31
00:02:56,822 --> 00:02:59,848
...or never evolve
beyond its simplest forms.

32
00:03:00,059 --> 00:03:02,459
And on some small
fraction of worlds...

33
00:03:02,662 --> 00:03:05,961
...there may develop intelligences
and civilizations...

34
00:03:06,165 --> 00:03:08,497
...more advanced than ours.

35
00:03:11,737 --> 00:03:14,706
All life on our planet
is closely related.

36
00:03:14,907 --> 00:03:19,276
We have a common organic chemistry
and a common evolutionary heritage.

37
00:03:19,478 --> 00:03:23,175
And so our biologists
are profoundly limited.

38
00:03:23,382 --> 00:03:25,646
They study a single biology...

39
00:03:25,851 --> 00:03:30,015
...one lonely theme
in the music of life.

40
00:03:30,222 --> 00:03:33,919
Is it the only voice
for thousands of light years...

41
00:03:34,126 --> 00:03:38,825
...or is there a cosmic fugue,
a billion different voices...

42
00:03:39,031 --> 00:03:42,967
...playing the life music
of the galaxy?

43
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,341
This blue world is where we grew up.

44
00:03:50,543 --> 00:03:52,636
There was once a time before life.

45
00:03:52,845 --> 00:03:56,008
Our planet is now
burgeoning with life.

46
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:58,080
How did it come about?

47
00:03:58,284 --> 00:04:01,742
How were organic molecules
originally made?

48
00:04:01,954 --> 00:04:04,218
How did life evolve
to produce beings...

49
00:04:04,423 --> 00:04:07,324
...as elaborate and complex as we...

50
00:04:07,526 --> 00:04:11,758
...able to explore the mystery
of our own origins?

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,527
Let me tell you a story
about one little phrase...

52
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:20,672
...in the music of life on Earth.

53
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,702
(WIND BLOWS)

54
00:04:38,157 --> 00:04:40,022
In the history of humans...

55
00:04:40,226 --> 00:04:42,091
...in the 12th century...

56
00:04:42,294 --> 00:04:46,890
...Japan was ruled by a clan
of warriors called the Heike.

57
00:04:56,542 --> 00:05:00,137
The nominal leader of the Heike,
the emperor of Japan...

58
00:05:00,346 --> 00:05:03,543
...was a 7-year-old boy
named Antoku.

59
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:08,049
His guardian was his grandmother,
the Lady Nii.

(DRUM BEATS)

61
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:20,360
The Heike were engaged
in a long and bloody war...

62
00:05:20,566 --> 00:05:23,933
...with another Samurai clan,
the Genji.

63
00:05:29,175 --> 00:05:32,508
Each asserted
a superior ancestral claim...

64
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:34,576
...to the imperial throne.

65
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,577
(BATTLE CRIES)

66
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:41,083
Their decisive encounter
occurred at Dannoura...

67
00:05:41,287 --> 00:05:44,848
...in the Japanese Inland Sea
on April 24...

68
00:05:45,057 --> 00:05:47,992
...in the year 1 185.

69
00:05:50,462 --> 00:05:53,488
The Heike were badly outnumbered
and outmaneuvered.

70
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:55,867
With their cause clearly lost...

71
00:05:56,068 --> 00:06:01,005
...the surviving Heike warriors threw
themselves into the sea and drowned.

72
00:06:07,246 --> 00:06:09,680
The emperor's grandmother,
the Lady Nii...

73
00:06:09,882 --> 00:06:12,612
...resolved that they would not
be captured by the enemy.

74
00:06:12,818 --> 00:06:17,221
What happened next is related
in "The Tale of the Heike":

75
00:06:18,057 --> 00:06:21,515
"The young emperor asked the Lady Nii,
'Where are you to take me?'

76
00:06:22,394 --> 00:06:27,093
She turned to the youthful sovereign
with tears streaming down her cheeks...

77
00:06:27,299 --> 00:06:28,698
...and comforted him.

78
00:06:31,704 --> 00:06:33,763
(WATER LAPS)

79
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,707
Blinded with tears...

80
00:06:42,915 --> 00:06:47,284
...the child sovereign put his
beautiful small hands together.

81
00:06:49,622 --> 00:06:51,522
He turned first to the east...

82
00:06:51,724 --> 00:06:54,887
...to say farewell
to the god of Ise...

83
00:06:55,094 --> 00:06:56,618
...and then to the west...

84
00:06:56,829 --> 00:07:00,492
...to recite a prayer
to the Amida Buddha.

85
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:03,428
The Lady Nii...

86
00:07:03,636 --> 00:07:06,161
...took him in her arms,
and with the words:

87
00:07:06,372 --> 00:07:09,341
'In the depths of the ocean
is our capital'...

88
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:12,772
...sank with him at last
beneath the waves."

89
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,999
The destruction of the Heike
battle fleet at Dannoura...

90
00:07:38,203 --> 00:07:41,001
...marked the end of the clan's
30-year rule.

91
00:07:41,206 --> 00:07:44,471
The Heike all but vanished
from history.

92
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:52,848
Only 43 Heike survived, all women.

93
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:56,385
These former ladies-in-waiting
of the Imperial Court...

94
00:07:56,588 --> 00:08:00,046
...were reduced to selling flowers
and other favors...

95
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:03,319
...to the fishermen near
the scene of the battle.

96
00:08:09,802 --> 00:08:12,999
These women and their offspring
by the fishermen...

97
00:08:13,205 --> 00:08:16,538
...established a festival
to commemorate the battle.

98
00:08:23,182 --> 00:08:26,845
To this day, every year,
on the 24th of April...

99
00:08:27,052 --> 00:08:29,953
...their descendants proceed
to the Akama shrine...

100
00:08:30,155 --> 00:08:31,850
...which contains the mausoleum...

101
00:08:32,057 --> 00:08:36,118
...of the drowned
7-year-old emperor, Antoku.

102
00:08:39,732 --> 00:08:42,860
There, they conduct a ceremony
of remembrance...

103
00:08:43,068 --> 00:08:47,027
...for the life and death
of the Heike warriors.

104
00:08:55,414 --> 00:08:58,383
But there is a strange
postscript to this story:

105
00:08:58,584 --> 00:09:00,142
The fishermen say...

106
00:09:00,352 --> 00:09:05,085
...that the Heike samurai
wander the bottom of the Inland Sea...

107
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:08,020
...in the form of crabs.

108
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:13,120
There are crabs here which have
curious markings on their backs.

109
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:16,391
Patterns which resemble
a human face...

110
00:09:16,602 --> 00:09:19,571
...with the aggressive scowl
of a samurai warrior...

111
00:09:19,772 --> 00:09:21,865
...from medieval Japan.

112
00:09:22,074 --> 00:09:24,736
(DRUM BEATS)

113
00:09:29,548 --> 00:09:32,642
These Heike crabs, when caught,
are not eaten.

114
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:35,319
They are thrown back into the sea...

115
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:38,251
...in commemoration
of the doleful events...

116
00:09:38,457 --> 00:09:41,426
...of the battle of Dannoura.

117
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:55,768
This legend raises a lovely problem:

118
00:09:55,974 --> 00:09:59,808
How does it come about that the face
of a warrior...

119
00:10:00,012 --> 00:10:04,779
...is cut on the carapace of
a Japanese crab? How could it be?

120
00:10:04,983 --> 00:10:09,545
The answer seems to be
that humans made this face.

121
00:10:09,888 --> 00:10:11,355
But how?

122
00:10:11,557 --> 00:10:14,822
Like many other features,
the patterns on the back...

123
00:10:15,027 --> 00:10:18,394
...or carapace of this crab
are inherited.

124
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:23,000
But among crabs, as among humans,
there are different hereditary lines.

125
00:10:23,435 --> 00:10:26,461
Now, suppose purely by chance...

126
00:10:26,672 --> 00:10:29,903
...among the distant ancestors
of this crab...

127
00:10:30,109 --> 00:10:34,842
...there came to be one which looked
just a little bit like a human face.

128
00:10:35,047 --> 00:10:38,539
Long before the battle, fishermen
may have been reluctant...

129
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,775
...to eat a crab with a human face.

130
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,486
In throwing it back into the sea...

131
00:10:43,689 --> 00:10:47,819
...they were setting into motion
a process of selection.

132
00:10:48,026 --> 00:10:52,554
If you're a crab and your carapace
is just ordinary...

133
00:10:52,764 --> 00:10:55,062
...the humans are gonna eat you.

134
00:10:55,267 --> 00:10:57,827
But if it looks a little bit
like a face...

135
00:10:58,036 --> 00:11:01,528
...they'll throw you back and you
can have lots of baby crabs...

136
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,503
...that all look just like you.

137
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:05,802
As many generations passed...

138
00:11:06,011 --> 00:11:08,878
...of crabs and fisher-folk alike...

139
00:11:09,081 --> 00:11:12,949
...the crabs with patterns that
looked most like a samurai face...

140
00:11:13,152 --> 00:11:15,347
...preferentially survived.

141
00:11:15,554 --> 00:11:19,115
Until eventually, there was produced
not just a human face...

142
00:11:19,324 --> 00:11:21,792
...not just a Japanese face...

143
00:11:21,994 --> 00:11:24,929
...but the face of a samurai warrior.

144
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:29,089
All this has nothing to do
with what the crabs might want.

145
00:11:29,301 --> 00:11:32,737
Selection is imposed from the outside.

146
00:11:32,938 --> 00:11:36,874
The more you look like a samurai,
the better your chances of survival.

147
00:11:37,075 --> 00:11:41,739
Eventually, there are a lot of crabs
that look like samurai warriors.

148
00:11:41,947 --> 00:11:44,973
(DRUM BEATS)

149
00:12:03,068 --> 00:12:06,629
This process is called
artificial selection.

150
00:12:07,372 --> 00:12:09,670
In the case of the Heike crab,
it was effected...

151
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:12,742
...more or less unconsciously
by the fishermen...

152
00:12:12,945 --> 00:12:17,211
...and certainly without any serious
contemplation by the crabs.

153
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,976
Humans, for thousands of years...

154
00:12:20,185 --> 00:12:22,050
...have deliberately selected...

155
00:12:22,254 --> 00:12:24,916
...which plants
and animals shall live.

156
00:12:25,157 --> 00:12:28,615
We're surrounded
by farm and domestic animals...

157
00:12:28,827 --> 00:12:30,124
...fruits, vegetables.

158
00:12:30,996 --> 00:12:34,625
Where do they come from? Were they
once free-living in the wild...

159
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:38,667
...and then induced to adopt some
less strenuous life on the farm?

160
00:12:39,137 --> 00:12:40,126
No.

161
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:44,400
They are, almost all of them,
made by us.

162
00:12:48,113 --> 00:12:52,641
The essence of artificial selection
for a horse or a cow...

163
00:12:52,851 --> 00:12:56,184
...a grain of rice
or a Heike crab, is this:

164
00:12:56,388 --> 00:12:59,687
Many characteristics are inherited.
They breed true.

165
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:05,255
Humans encourage the reproduction
of some varieties...

166
00:13:05,464 --> 00:13:07,398
...and discourage
the reproduction of others.

167
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:11,035
The variety selected for,
eventually becomes abundant.

168
00:13:11,236 --> 00:13:15,195
The variety selected against,
becomes rare, maybe extinct.

169
00:13:16,408 --> 00:13:19,571
But if artificial selection
makes such changes...

170
00:13:19,778 --> 00:13:21,837
...in only a few thousand years...

171
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,072
...what must natural selection...

172
00:13:24,283 --> 00:13:28,276
...working for billions of years,
be capable of?

173
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,578
The answer...

174
00:13:29,788 --> 00:13:33,588
...is all the beauty and diversity
in the biological world.

175
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:42,391
That life evolved over
the ages is clear...

176
00:13:42,601 --> 00:13:46,230
...from the changes we've made
in the beasts and vegetables...

177
00:13:46,571 --> 00:13:50,132
...but also from
the record in the rocks.

178
00:13:50,442 --> 00:13:53,206
The fossil evidence speaks
to us unambiguously...

179
00:13:53,412 --> 00:13:57,906
...of creatures that were once
present in enormous numbers...

180
00:13:58,116 --> 00:14:00,141
...and that have now vanished utterly.

181
00:14:00,352 --> 00:14:03,844
There are more species that have
become extinct than exist today.

182
00:14:04,056 --> 00:14:08,152
They are the terminated
experiments in evolution.

183
00:14:09,227 --> 00:14:13,823
These guys, the trilobites,
appeared 600 million years ago.

184
00:14:14,032 --> 00:14:16,660
They were around
for 300 million years.

185
00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:20,133
They're all gone. There's none left.

186
00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:25,069
But in those old rocks, there are
no fossils of people or cattle.

187
00:14:25,277 --> 00:14:27,108
We've evolved only recently.

188
00:14:28,313 --> 00:14:31,544
Evolution is a fact, not a theory.

189
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,684
It really happened.

190
00:14:35,253 --> 00:14:37,221
(BEE BUZZES)

191
00:14:39,624 --> 00:14:43,856
That the mechanism of evolution is
natural selection was the discovery...

192
00:14:44,062 --> 00:14:47,498
...of Charles Darwin
and Alfred Russel Wallace.

193
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,394
Here's how it works:

194
00:14:49,901 --> 00:14:51,425
Nature is prolific.

195
00:14:51,636 --> 00:14:55,504
There are many more creatures that
are born than can possibly survive.

196
00:14:55,707 --> 00:15:00,644
So those varieties which are,
by accident, less well adapted...

197
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:04,371
...don't survive, or at least
they leave fewer offspring.

198
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:09,043
Now, mutations, sudden
changes in heredity...

199
00:15:09,254 --> 00:15:11,313
...are passed on. They breed true.

200
00:15:11,523 --> 00:15:16,460
The environment selects the occasional
mutations which enhance survival.

201
00:15:16,695 --> 00:15:21,132
The resulting series of slow changes
in the nature of living beings...

202
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,460
...is the origin of new species.

203
00:15:25,036 --> 00:15:28,403
Many people were scandalized...

204
00:15:28,607 --> 00:15:30,802
...by the ideas of evolution
and natural selection.

205
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:33,136
Our ancestors looked at...

206
00:15:33,345 --> 00:15:36,143
...the intricacy
and the beauty of life...

207
00:15:36,348 --> 00:15:40,148
...and saw evidence
for a great designer.

208
00:15:43,054 --> 00:15:46,546
The simplest organism
is a far more complex machine...

209
00:15:46,758 --> 00:15:48,919
...than the finest pocket watch.

210
00:15:49,127 --> 00:15:53,427
And yet, pocket watches don't
spontaneously self-assemble...

211
00:15:53,632 --> 00:15:56,931
...or evolve in slow
stages on their own...

212
00:15:57,135 --> 00:15:59,933
...from say, grandfather clocks.

213
00:16:00,238 --> 00:16:03,173
A watch implies a watchmaker.

214
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:09,304
There seemed to be no way atoms
could spontaneously fall together...

215
00:16:09,514 --> 00:16:11,948
...and create, say...

216
00:16:13,652 --> 00:16:14,812
...a dandelion.

217
00:16:15,487 --> 00:16:17,785
The idea of a designer...

218
00:16:17,989 --> 00:16:22,653
...is an appealing and altogether human
explanation of the biological world.

219
00:16:22,861 --> 00:16:26,092
But as Darwin and Wallace showed...

220
00:16:26,298 --> 00:16:27,959
...there's another way...

221
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:31,897
...equally human
and far more compelling.

222
00:16:32,304 --> 00:16:36,434
Natural selection, which makes
the music of life more beautiful...

223
00:16:36,641 --> 00:16:38,836
...as the eons pass.

224
00:16:42,514 --> 00:16:44,641
(LOUD RUMBLE)

225
00:16:44,883 --> 00:16:47,078
To understand the passage
of the eons...

226
00:16:47,285 --> 00:16:50,618
...we have compressed all of time
into a single cosmic year...

227
00:16:50,822 --> 00:16:54,155
...with the big bang on January first.

228
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:58,796
Every month here represents
a little over a billion years.

229
00:16:58,997 --> 00:17:02,865
The Earth didn't form until
the cosmic year was two-thirds over.

230
00:17:03,068 --> 00:17:07,232
Our understanding of the history
of life is very recent...

231
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,875
...occupying only the last few
seconds of December 31...

232
00:17:11,076 --> 00:17:15,206
...that small white spot at bottom
right in the cosmic calendar.

233
00:17:15,413 --> 00:17:17,813
What happened on Earth may be
more or less typical...

234
00:17:18,016 --> 00:17:20,484
...of the evolution of life
on many worlds.

235
00:17:20,685 --> 00:17:22,676
But in its details...

236
00:17:22,888 --> 00:17:25,083
...the story of life on Earth...

237
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:28,088
...is probably unique
in all the Milky Way galaxy.

238
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,197
The secrets of evolution
are time and death.

239
00:17:33,398 --> 00:17:37,232
Time for the slow accumulation
of favorable mutations...

240
00:17:37,435 --> 00:17:41,030
...and death to make room
for new species.

241
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,005
Life on Earth arose in September
of the cosmic calendar...

242
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:49,874
...when our world, still battered and
cratered from its violent origin...

243
00:17:50,081 --> 00:17:52,242
...may have looked
a little like the moon.

244
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:57,946
The Earth is about four and a half
billion years old.

245
00:17:58,156 --> 00:17:59,487
In the cosmic calendar...

246
00:17:59,691 --> 00:18:03,684
...it condensed out of interstellar
gas and dust...

247
00:18:03,895 --> 00:18:06,523
...around September 1 4.

248
00:18:06,731 --> 00:18:10,394
We know from the fossil record
that life originated soon after...

249
00:18:10,602 --> 00:18:13,867
...maybe around September 25,
something like that...

250
00:18:14,072 --> 00:18:17,940
...probably in the ponds and oceans
of the primitive Earth.

251
00:18:18,176 --> 00:18:22,772
The first living things were not
as complex as a one-celled organism...

252
00:18:22,981 --> 00:18:26,610
...which is already a highly
sophisticated form of life.

253
00:18:26,818 --> 00:18:30,845
No, the first stirrings
of life were much more humble...

254
00:18:31,056 --> 00:18:33,889
...and happened on the molecular level.

255
00:18:34,092 --> 00:18:38,290
In those early days, lightning
and ultraviolet light from the sun...

256
00:18:38,496 --> 00:18:42,694
...were breaking apart hydrogen-rich
molecules in the atmosphere.

257
00:18:42,901 --> 00:18:47,395
The fragments of the molecules
were spontaneously recombining...

258
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:51,406
...into more and more
complex molecules.

259
00:18:53,545 --> 00:18:57,504
The products of this early
chemistry dissolved in the oceans...

260
00:18:57,716 --> 00:19:01,015
...forming a kind of organic soup...

261
00:19:01,219 --> 00:19:03,346
...of gradually increasing complexity.

262
00:19:03,555 --> 00:19:07,355
Until one day, quite by accident...

263
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:11,655
...a molecule arose that was able
to make crude copies of itself...

264
00:19:11,863 --> 00:19:15,299
...using as building blocks
the other molecules in the soup.

265
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,958
This was the ancestor of DNA...

266
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:22,537
...the master molecule
of life on Earth.

267
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:26,404
It's made of four different
parts, called nucleotides...

268
00:19:26,611 --> 00:19:30,308
...which constitute the four letters
of the genetic code...

269
00:19:30,515 --> 00:19:32,073
...the language of heredity.

270
00:19:32,283 --> 00:19:37,152
Each of the nucleotides,
the rungs on the DNA ladder...

271
00:19:37,355 --> 00:19:39,653
...are a different color
in this model.

272
00:19:39,858 --> 00:19:43,123
The instructions are different
for different organisms.

273
00:19:43,328 --> 00:19:45,694
That's why organisms
are different.

274
00:19:45,897 --> 00:19:49,731
Now, a mutation is a change
of a nucleotide...

275
00:19:49,934 --> 00:19:52,960
...a misspelling
of the genetic instructions.

276
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:58,040
Most mutations spell genetic
nonsense since they're random.

277
00:19:58,243 --> 00:20:00,438
They harm the next generation.

278
00:20:00,645 --> 00:20:02,943
But a very few, by accident...

279
00:20:03,148 --> 00:20:07,642
...make better sense than the
original codes, and aid evolution.

280
00:20:08,353 --> 00:20:11,652
DNA is about a billion
times smaller...

281
00:20:11,856 --> 00:20:13,585
...than we see it here.

282
00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:18,729
Each of those things that looks
like a piece of fruit is an atom.

283
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,522
Without the tools of science...

284
00:20:20,732 --> 00:20:24,031
...the machinery of life
would be invisible.

285
00:20:28,273 --> 00:20:29,900
Four billion years ago...

286
00:20:30,108 --> 00:20:34,135
...the ancestors of DNA competed
for molecular building blocks...

287
00:20:34,345 --> 00:20:37,314
...and left crude copies
of themselves.

288
00:20:37,515 --> 00:20:40,780
There were no predators;
the stuff of life was everywhere.

289
00:20:40,985 --> 00:20:44,352
The oceans and murky pools
that filled the craters...

290
00:20:44,556 --> 00:20:47,855
...were, for these molecules,
a Garden of Eden.

291
00:20:48,193 --> 00:20:51,185
With reproduction, mutation
and natural selection...

292
00:20:51,396 --> 00:20:55,423
...the evolution of living
molecules was well underway.

293
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:59,869
Varieties with specialized
functions joined together...

294
00:21:00,071 --> 00:21:03,097
...making a collective.
The first cell.

295
00:21:03,308 --> 00:21:06,368
The organic soup eventually
ate itself up.

296
00:21:06,578 --> 00:21:09,945
But by this time, plants had evolved,
able to use sunlight...

297
00:21:10,148 --> 00:21:14,881
...to make their own building blocks.
They turned the waters green.

298
00:21:15,086 --> 00:21:17,281
One-celled plants
joined together:

299
00:21:17,489 --> 00:21:20,515
The first multi-cellular organisms.

300
00:21:22,026 --> 00:21:26,463
Equally important was the invention,
not made until early November...

301
00:21:26,664 --> 00:21:31,158
...of sex. It was stumbled upon
by the microbes.

302
00:21:33,838 --> 00:21:37,501
By December 1, green plants
had released copious amounts...

303
00:21:37,709 --> 00:21:40,940
...of oxygen and nitrogen
into the atmosphere.

304
00:21:41,146 --> 00:21:44,445
The sky is made by life.

305
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,480
Then, suddenly, on December 1 5...

306
00:21:48,686 --> 00:21:51,678
...there was an enormous proliferation
of new life forms...

307
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:55,326
...an event called
the "Cambrian Explosion."

308
00:22:00,265 --> 00:22:04,759
We know from fossils that life arose
shortly after the Earth formed...

309
00:22:04,969 --> 00:22:08,700
...suggesting that the origin
of life might be...

310
00:22:08,907 --> 00:22:13,105
...an inevitable chemical process
on countless Earth-like planets...

311
00:22:13,311 --> 00:22:14,903
...throughout the cosmos.

312
00:22:15,113 --> 00:22:19,914
But on the Earth, in nearly 4 billion
years, life advanced no further...

313
00:22:20,118 --> 00:22:21,085
...than algae.

314
00:22:21,286 --> 00:22:26,087
So maybe more complex forms of life
are harder to evolve...

315
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:28,851
...harder even than the origin
of life itself.

316
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,722
If this is right, the planets
of the galaxy...

317
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,592
...might be filled
with microorganisms...

318
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,667
...but big beasts and vegetables
and thinking beings...

319
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:41,668
...might be comparatively rare.

320
00:22:45,143 --> 00:22:49,204
By December 18, there were vast
herds of trilobites...

321
00:22:49,414 --> 00:22:51,541
...foraging on the ocean bottom...

322
00:22:51,749 --> 00:22:55,185
...and squid-like creatures with
multicolored shells...

323
00:22:55,386 --> 00:22:56,853
...were everywhere.

324
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:03,386
We know enough to sketch in a few
of the subsequent details.

325
00:23:03,595 --> 00:23:07,292
The first fish and the first
vertebrates appeared on December 19.

326
00:23:07,498 --> 00:23:11,059
Plants began to colonize the land
on December 20.

327
00:23:11,269 --> 00:23:15,365
The first winged insects fluttered by
on December 22.

328
00:23:15,573 --> 00:23:18,701
On this date also, there were
the first amphibians...

329
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:21,344
...creatures something
like the lungfish...

330
00:23:21,546 --> 00:23:24,811
...able to survive both on land
and in water.

331
00:23:25,016 --> 00:23:29,248
Our direct ancestors were now
leaving the oceans behind.

332
00:23:32,123 --> 00:23:37,060
The first trees and the first reptiles
evolved on December 23:

333
00:23:37,295 --> 00:23:40,560
Two amazing evolutionary developments.

334
00:23:42,901 --> 00:23:46,337
We are descended
from some of those reptiles.

335
00:23:50,742 --> 00:23:54,075
The dinosaurs appeared
on Christmas Eve.

336
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:56,338
There were many different
kinds of dinosaurs.

337
00:23:56,547 --> 00:23:59,516
The Earth was once their planet.

338
00:24:02,654 --> 00:24:06,090
Many stood upright and had
some fair intelligence.

339
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:11,126
Great lizards crashed and thundered
through the steaming jungles.

340
00:24:16,234 --> 00:24:18,862
Unnoticed by the dinosaurs,
a new creature...

341
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,231
...whose young were born live
and helpless...

342
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:23,771
...was making its timid debut.

343
00:24:23,975 --> 00:24:27,103
The first mammals emerged
on December 26...

344
00:24:27,312 --> 00:24:30,577
...the first birds
on the following day.

345
00:24:33,885 --> 00:24:37,286
But the dinosaurs still
dominated the planet.

346
00:24:37,488 --> 00:24:41,424
Then suddenly, without warning,
all over the planet at once...

347
00:24:41,626 --> 00:24:43,389
...the dinosaurs died.

348
00:24:43,594 --> 00:24:46,961
The cause is unknown,
but the lesson is clear:

349
00:24:47,165 --> 00:24:51,864
Even 160 million years on a planet
is no guarantee of survival.

350
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:56,564
The dinosaurs perished
around the time of the first flower.

351
00:24:58,409 --> 00:25:00,536
On December 30, the first creatures...

352
00:25:00,745 --> 00:25:03,578
...who looked even a little bit human,
evolved...

353
00:25:03,781 --> 00:25:07,945
...accompanied by a spectacular increase
in the size of their brains.

354
00:25:08,152 --> 00:25:12,020
And then, on the evening
of the last day of the last month...

355
00:25:12,223 --> 00:25:13,850
...only a few million years ago...

356
00:25:14,058 --> 00:25:18,893
...the first true humans took
their place on the cosmic calendar.

357
00:25:20,198 --> 00:25:21,995
The written record of history...

358
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,863
...occupies only the last 10 seconds
of the cosmic year.

359
00:25:28,373 --> 00:25:32,275
Now, let's take a closer look
at who our ancestors were.

360
00:25:32,477 --> 00:25:35,537
A simple chemical circumstance
led to a great moment...

361
00:25:35,747 --> 00:25:37,772
...in the history of our planet.

362
00:25:37,982 --> 00:25:40,917
There were many molecules
in the primordial soup.

363
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:45,954
Some were attracted to water on one
side and repelled by it on the other.

364
00:25:46,157 --> 00:25:48,751
This drove them together...

365
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,758
...into a tiny enclosed
spherical shell...

366
00:25:51,963 --> 00:25:54,761
...like a soap bubble,
which protected the interior.

367
00:25:54,966 --> 00:25:58,527
Within the bubble,
the ancestors of DNA found a home...

368
00:25:58,736 --> 00:26:00,431
...and the first cell arose.

369
00:26:00,638 --> 00:26:04,631
It took hundreds of millions of years
for tiny plants to evolve...

370
00:26:04,842 --> 00:26:06,309
...giving off oxygen.

371
00:26:06,511 --> 00:26:09,742
But that branch didn't lead to us.

372
00:26:10,248 --> 00:26:15,083
Bacteria that could breathe oxygen
took over a billion years to evolve.

373
00:26:16,454 --> 00:26:20,788
From a naked nucleus, a cell
developed with a nucleus inside.

374
00:26:22,193 --> 00:26:26,493
Some of these amoeba-like forms
led eventually to plants.

375
00:26:30,568 --> 00:26:32,502
Others produced colonies...

376
00:26:32,703 --> 00:26:36,969
...with inside and outside cells
performing different functions.

377
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,141
Becoming...

378
00:26:40,344 --> 00:26:44,007
...a polyp attached
to the ocean floor...

379
00:26:44,215 --> 00:26:46,581
...filtering food from the water...

380
00:26:47,018 --> 00:26:49,543
...and evolving little tentacles...

381
00:26:49,754 --> 00:26:53,087
...to direct food
into a primitive mouth.

382
00:26:54,325 --> 00:26:56,020
This humble ancestor of ours
also led...

383
00:26:56,227 --> 00:27:00,391
...to spiny-skinned armored animals
with internal organs...

384
00:27:00,598 --> 00:27:04,466
...including our cousin, the starfish.

385
00:27:04,669 --> 00:27:07,103
But we don't come from starfish.

386
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:10,303
About 550 million years ago...

387
00:27:10,508 --> 00:27:13,500
...filter feeders
evolved gill slits...

388
00:27:13,711 --> 00:27:17,010
...which were more efficient
at straining food particles.

389
00:27:17,215 --> 00:27:20,946
One evolutionary branch
led to acorn worms.

390
00:27:21,219 --> 00:27:25,747
Another led to a creature which
swam freely in the larval stage...

391
00:27:25,957 --> 00:27:29,290
...but, as an adult, was still
firmly anchored to the ocean floor.

392
00:27:29,494 --> 00:27:32,156
Some became living hollow tubes.

393
00:27:32,697 --> 00:27:37,031
But others retained the larval forms
throughout the life cycle...

394
00:27:37,235 --> 00:27:41,262
...and became free-swimming adults
with something like a backbone.

395
00:27:46,244 --> 00:27:47,802
Our ancestors now...

396
00:27:48,012 --> 00:27:52,346
...500 million years ago,
were jawless filter-feeding fish...

397
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,984
...a little like lampreys.

398
00:27:56,787 --> 00:27:59,017
Gradually, those tiny fish...

399
00:27:59,223 --> 00:28:01,885
...evolved eyes and jaws.

400
00:28:02,393 --> 00:28:04,554
Fish then began to eat one another...

401
00:28:04,762 --> 00:28:07,822
...if you could swim fast,
you survived.

402
00:28:09,567 --> 00:28:14,436
If you had jaws to eat with, you could
use your gills to breathe in the water.

403
00:28:14,739 --> 00:28:17,640
This is the way modern fish arose.

404
00:28:21,913 --> 00:28:24,473
During the summer,
swamps and lakes dried up.

405
00:28:24,682 --> 00:28:29,483
Some fish evolved a primitive lung
to breathe air until the rains came.

406
00:28:29,687 --> 00:28:31,985
Their brains were getting bigger.

407
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:35,717
If the rains didn't come, it was handy
to be able to pull yourself...

408
00:28:35,927 --> 00:28:37,189
...to the next swamp.

409
00:28:37,395 --> 00:28:40,296
That was a very important adaptation.

410
00:28:43,834 --> 00:28:47,270
The first amphibians evolved,
still with a fish-like tail.

411
00:28:47,471 --> 00:28:51,840
Amphibians, like fish, laid their eggs
in water where they were easily eaten.

412
00:28:52,043 --> 00:28:54,671
But then a splendid
new invention came along:

413
00:28:54,879 --> 00:28:59,475
The hard-shelled egg, laid on land
where there were as yet no predators.

414
00:28:59,684 --> 00:29:04,246
Reptiles and turtles
go back to those days.

415
00:29:06,224 --> 00:29:09,557
Many of the reptiles hatched on land
never returned to the waters.

416
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,285
Some became the dinosaurs.

417
00:29:12,663 --> 00:29:16,895
One line of dinosaurs developed
feathers, useful for short flights.

418
00:29:17,101 --> 00:29:21,970
Today, the only living descendants
of the dinosaurs are the birds.

419
00:29:23,674 --> 00:29:26,108
The great dinosaurs evolved
along another branch.

420
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:29,336
Some were the largest flesh-eaters
ever to walk the land.

421
00:29:29,547 --> 00:29:34,314
But 65 million years ago they all
mysteriously perished.

422
00:29:35,553 --> 00:29:37,953
Meanwhile, the forerunners
of the dinosaurs...

423
00:29:38,155 --> 00:29:40,783
...were also evolving
in a different direction.

424
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,722
Small, scurrying creatures...

425
00:29:43,928 --> 00:29:46,829
...with the young growing
inside the mother's body.

426
00:29:47,031 --> 00:29:51,434
After the extinction of the dinosaurs,
many different forms developed.

427
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:58,436
The young were very immature at birth.

428
00:29:58,643 --> 00:30:01,703
In the marsupials,
the wombat, for example...

429
00:30:01,912 --> 00:30:05,507
...and in the mammals, the young had
to be taught how to survive.

430
00:30:05,716 --> 00:30:07,911
The brain grew larger still.

431
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:12,453
Something like a shrew was
the ancestor of all the mammals.

432
00:30:17,161 --> 00:30:20,995
One line took to the trees,
developing dexterity...

433
00:30:21,198 --> 00:30:23,166
...stereo vision, larger brains...

434
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:25,858
...and a curiosity
about their environment.

435
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:30,905
Some became baboons,
but that's not the line to us.

436
00:30:32,276 --> 00:30:35,268
Apes and humans have
a recent common ancestor.

437
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:39,438
Bone for bone, muscle for muscle,
molecule for molecule.

438
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:44,587
There are almost no important
differences between apes and humans.

439
00:30:47,558 --> 00:30:51,858
Unlike the chimpanzee,
our ancestors walked upright...

440
00:30:52,063 --> 00:30:56,090
...freeing their hands
to poke and fix and experiment.

441
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,758
We got smarter. We began to talk.

442
00:31:06,277 --> 00:31:08,939
Many collateral branches
of the human family...

443
00:31:09,146 --> 00:31:12,604
...became extinct in
the last few million years.

444
00:31:12,817 --> 00:31:17,220
We, with our brains and our hands,
are the survivors.

445
00:31:17,421 --> 00:31:22,358
There's an unbroken thread that
stretches from those first cells to us.

446
00:31:22,693 --> 00:31:23,990
Let's look at it again...

447
00:31:24,195 --> 00:31:28,996
...compressing 4 billion years
of human evolution into 40 seconds.

448
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:18,242
Those are some of the things
that molecules do...

449
00:32:18,449 --> 00:32:21,509
...given 4 billion years of evolution.

450
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,020
We sometimes represent evolution as
the ever-branching ramifications...

451
00:32:27,224 --> 00:32:28,589
...of some original trunk...

452
00:32:28,793 --> 00:32:33,059
...each branch pruned and clipped
by natural selection.

453
00:32:33,898 --> 00:32:35,866
Every plant and animal
alive today...

454
00:32:36,066 --> 00:32:40,469
...has a history as ancient
and illustrious as ours.

455
00:32:40,671 --> 00:32:44,038
Humans stand on one branch.

456
00:32:44,475 --> 00:32:47,376
But now we affect
the future of every branch...

457
00:32:47,578 --> 00:32:50,638
...of this 4-billion-year-old tree.

458
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:56,310
How lovely trees are.

459
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,751
The human species grew up
in and around them.

460
00:32:59,957 --> 00:33:02,892
We have a natural affinity for trees.

461
00:33:03,093 --> 00:33:05,152
Trees photosynthesize...

462
00:33:05,362 --> 00:33:08,092
...they harvest sunlight...

463
00:33:08,299 --> 00:33:12,201
...they compete for the sun's favors.

464
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,799
Look at those two trees there...

465
00:33:15,005 --> 00:33:18,202
...pushing and shoving for sunlight...

466
00:33:18,409 --> 00:33:23,005
...but with grace
and astonishing slowness.

467
00:33:30,688 --> 00:33:32,918
There are so many plants
on the Earth...

468
00:33:33,123 --> 00:33:35,683
...that there's a danger
of thinking them trivial...

469
00:33:35,893 --> 00:33:40,023
...of losing sight of the subtlety
and efficiency of their design.

470
00:33:40,231 --> 00:33:44,793
They are great and beautiful
machines, powered by sunlight...

471
00:33:45,002 --> 00:33:48,836
...taking in water from the ground
and carbon dioxide from the air...

472
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:53,635
...and converting them into food
for their use and ours.

473
00:34:01,986 --> 00:34:05,547
This is a museum of living plants.

474
00:34:05,756 --> 00:34:10,625
The Royal Botanic Gardens
at Kew in London.

475
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:19,302
Every plant uses
the carbohydrates it makes...

476
00:34:19,503 --> 00:34:23,200
...as an energy source
to go about its planty business.

477
00:34:23,407 --> 00:34:27,241
And we animals, who are ultimately
parasites on the plants...

478
00:34:27,444 --> 00:34:31,278
...we steal the carbohydrates
so we can go about our business.

479
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:39,282
In eating the plants
and their fruits...

480
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:42,459
...we combine the carbohydrates
with oxygen...

481
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:45,891
...which as a result of breathing,
we've dissolved in our blood.

482
00:34:46,096 --> 00:34:51,033
From this chemical reaction, we
extract the energy which makes us go.

483
00:34:51,468 --> 00:34:54,335
In the process,
we exhale carbon dioxide...

484
00:34:54,538 --> 00:34:57,939
...which the plants then use
to make more carbohydrates.

485
00:35:00,044 --> 00:35:02,740
What a marvelous
cooperative arrangement.

486
00:35:02,947 --> 00:35:06,075
Plants and animals each using
the other's waste gases...

487
00:35:06,283 --> 00:35:10,879
...the whole cycle powered
by abundant sunlight.

488
00:35:11,288 --> 00:35:15,054
But there would be carbon dioxide in
the air even if there were no animals.

489
00:35:15,259 --> 00:35:18,854
We need the plants
much more than they need us.

490
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,959
There are family resemblances
among the organisms of the Earth.

491
00:35:27,171 --> 00:35:31,574
Some are very apparent,
such as the use of the number five.

492
00:35:31,775 --> 00:35:34,642
Humans have five major
bodily projections:

493
00:35:34,845 --> 00:35:38,144
One head, two arms, two legs.

494
00:35:38,349 --> 00:35:39,816
So do ducks...

495
00:35:40,017 --> 00:35:44,420
...although the functions of their
projections are not quite the same.

496
00:35:44,622 --> 00:35:48,114
An octopus or a centipede
has a different plan.

497
00:35:48,325 --> 00:35:53,024
And a being from another planet
might be much stranger still.

498
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:58,099
These family resemblances continue
and on a much deeper level...

499
00:35:58,302 --> 00:36:01,237
...when we go to the
molecular basis of life.

500
00:36:01,438 --> 00:36:04,134
There are tens of billions...

501
00:36:04,341 --> 00:36:07,242
...of different kinds
of organic molecules.

502
00:36:07,444 --> 00:36:09,639
Yet only about 50 of them...

503
00:36:09,847 --> 00:36:12,941
...are used in the essential
machinery of life.

504
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:15,584
The same 50 employed
over and over again...

505
00:36:15,786 --> 00:36:20,382
...ingenious, for different functions
in every living thing.

506
00:36:20,591 --> 00:36:23,355
And when we go to the very kernel
of life on Earth...

507
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:27,018
...to the proteins that
control cell chemistry...

508
00:36:27,231 --> 00:36:31,133
...to the spiral or helix
of nucleic acids...

509
00:36:31,335 --> 00:36:33,929
...which carry
the hereditary information...

510
00:36:34,138 --> 00:36:38,165
...we find these molecules
to be identical...

511
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:41,970
...in all plants and animals
of our planet.

512
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:11,366
This oak tree and me,
we're made of the same stuff.

513
00:37:11,575 --> 00:37:14,476
If you go back, you'll find
that we have a common ancestor.

514
00:37:14,678 --> 00:37:17,909
That's why our chemistry is so alike.

515
00:37:20,951 --> 00:37:24,944
Let's take a trip to examine
this common basis of life.

516
00:37:25,155 --> 00:37:28,556
A voyage to investigate
the molecular machinery...

517
00:37:28,759 --> 00:37:30,886
...at the heart of life on Earth.

518
00:37:31,095 --> 00:37:34,656
A journey to the nucleus of the cell.

519
00:37:34,898 --> 00:37:36,422
First we need a cell.

520
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,266
I have trillions.
I can afford to donate a few.

521
00:37:47,311 --> 00:37:50,041
The casual act of pricking a finger...

522
00:37:50,247 --> 00:37:53,876
...is an event of some magnitude
on the scale of the very small.

523
00:37:54,084 --> 00:37:58,783
Millions of red blood cells are
detoured from their usual routes.

524
00:38:00,758 --> 00:38:03,591
But most continue
to cruise about the body...

525
00:38:03,794 --> 00:38:07,753
...carrying their cargoes of oxygen
to the remotest freckle.

526
00:38:08,866 --> 00:38:11,061
We're about to enter
the living cell...

527
00:38:11,268 --> 00:38:14,795
...a realm, in its own way,
as complex and beautiful...

528
00:38:15,005 --> 00:38:17,974
...as the realm of galaxies and stars.

529
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:21,367
Among the red blood cells,
we encounter a white blood cell...

530
00:38:21,578 --> 00:38:23,170
...a lymphocyte...

531
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:26,349
...whose job it is to protect me
against invading microbes.

532
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:29,485
It makes antibodies
on its furrowed surface...

533
00:38:29,686 --> 00:38:33,213
...but its interior is
like that of many cells.

534
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:39,152
Plunging through the membrane,
we find ourselves inside the cell.

535
00:38:39,363 --> 00:38:43,026
Here, every structure
has its function.

536
00:38:45,869 --> 00:38:48,770
These dark green blobs
are factories...

537
00:38:48,972 --> 00:38:51,941
...where messenger molecules
are busy building the enzymes...

538
00:38:52,142 --> 00:38:54,440
...which control
the chemistry of the cell.

539
00:38:54,645 --> 00:38:57,739
The messengers were
instructed and dispatched...

540
00:38:57,948 --> 00:39:02,044
...from within the nucleus,
the heart and brain of the cell.

541
00:39:02,386 --> 00:39:04,911
All the instructions on
how to get a cell to work...

542
00:39:05,122 --> 00:39:08,023
...and how to make another
are hidden away in there.

543
00:39:08,225 --> 00:39:10,693
We find a tunnel, a nuclear pore...

544
00:39:10,894 --> 00:39:14,625
...an approach to
the biological holy of holies.

545
00:39:16,834 --> 00:39:21,771
These necklaces, these intricately
looped and coiled strands...

546
00:39:21,972 --> 00:39:24,532
...are nucleic acids, DNA.

547
00:39:26,076 --> 00:39:28,636
Everything you need to know on
how to make a human being...

548
00:39:28,846 --> 00:39:33,783
...is encoded in the language
of life in the DNA molecule.

549
00:39:41,325 --> 00:39:44,522
This is the DNA double helix...

550
00:39:44,728 --> 00:39:49,665
...a machine with about 100 billion
moving parts, called atoms.

551
00:39:50,601 --> 00:39:53,695
There are as many atoms
in one molecule of DNA...

552
00:39:53,904 --> 00:39:57,601
...as there are stars
in a typical galaxy.

553
00:40:01,945 --> 00:40:05,278
The sequence of nucleotides,
here brightly colored...

554
00:40:05,482 --> 00:40:08,474
...is all that's passed on
from generation to generation.

555
00:40:08,685 --> 00:40:10,915
Change the order of the nucleotides...

556
00:40:11,121 --> 00:40:14,181
...and you change
the genetic instructions.

557
00:40:21,665 --> 00:40:25,692
DNA must replicate itself
with extreme fidelity.

558
00:40:25,903 --> 00:40:30,499
The reproduction of a DNA molecule
begins by separating the two helices.

559
00:40:30,707 --> 00:40:34,666
This is accomplished
by an unwinding enzyme.

560
00:40:34,878 --> 00:40:38,871
Like some precision tool,
this enzyme, shown in blue...

561
00:40:39,082 --> 00:40:44,019
...breaks the chemical bonds
that bind the two helices of DNA.

562
00:40:44,655 --> 00:40:47,249
The enzyme works its way
down the molecule...

563
00:40:47,457 --> 00:40:50,722
...unzipping DNA as it goes.

564
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:55,423
Each helix copies the other...

565
00:40:55,632 --> 00:40:58,829
...supervised by special enzymes.

566
00:40:59,036 --> 00:41:02,870
The organic soup inside the nucleus
contains many free nucleotides.

567
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:08,077
The enzyme recognizes an approaching
nucleotide and clicks it into place...

568
00:41:08,378 --> 00:41:11,643
...reproducing another rung
in the double helix.

569
00:41:15,919 --> 00:41:18,547
When the DNA is replicating
in one of your cells...

570
00:41:18,755 --> 00:41:21,622
...a few dozen nucleotides
are added every second.

571
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:26,362
Thousands of these enzymes may be
working on a given DNA molecule.

572
00:41:36,206 --> 00:41:38,970
When an arriving nucleotide
doesn't fit...

573
00:41:39,176 --> 00:41:41,235
...the enzyme throws it away.

574
00:41:41,445 --> 00:41:43,072
We call this proofreading.

575
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,771
On the rare occasions
of a proofreading error...

576
00:41:45,983 --> 00:41:47,917
...the wrong nucleotide is attached...

577
00:41:48,118 --> 00:41:51,747
...and a small random change has
been made in the genetic instructions.

578
00:41:51,955 --> 00:41:54,321
A mutation has occurred.

579
00:41:55,859 --> 00:41:58,623
This enzyme is a
pretty small molecule...

580
00:41:58,829 --> 00:42:01,821
...but it catches nucleotides,
assembles them in the right order...

581
00:42:02,032 --> 00:42:03,465
...it knows how to proofread...

582
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:06,534
...it's responsible
in the most fundamental way...

583
00:42:06,737 --> 00:42:11,231
...for the reproduction of every cell
and every being on Earth.

584
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,171
That enzyme and DNA itself...

585
00:42:19,383 --> 00:42:23,319
...are molecular machines
with awesome powers.

586
00:42:26,023 --> 00:42:29,584
Within every living thing,
the molecular machines are busy...

587
00:42:29,793 --> 00:42:34,389
...making sure that nucleic acids
will continue to reproduce.

588
00:42:55,318 --> 00:42:58,776
A minor cut in my skin
sounds a local alarm...

589
00:42:58,989 --> 00:43:02,857
...and the blood spins
a complex net of strong fibers...

590
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:06,223
...to form a clot
and staunch the flow of blood.

591
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:08,125
There's a very delicate balance here:

592
00:43:08,331 --> 00:43:11,459
Too much clotting
and your blood stream will solidify.

593
00:43:11,668 --> 00:43:15,798
Too little clotting and you'll bleed
to death from the merest scratch.

594
00:43:16,106 --> 00:43:21,043
The balance is controlled
by enzymes instructed by DNA.

595
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,843
Down here, there's also
a kind of sanitation squad...

596
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:30,315
...comprised of white blood cells,
that swings into action...

597
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:35,150
...surrounds invading bacteria
and ravenously consumes them.

598
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:38,521
This mopping-up operation is
a part of the healing process...

599
00:43:38,728 --> 00:43:41,720
...again controlled by DNA.

600
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:47,430
These cells are parts of us,
but how alien they seem.

601
00:43:47,637 --> 00:43:50,265
Within each of them,
within every cell...

602
00:43:50,474 --> 00:43:53,500
...there are exquisitely
evolved molecular machines.

603
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:57,271
Nucleic acids, enzymes,
the cell architecture...

604
00:43:57,481 --> 00:44:01,349
...every cell is a triumph
of natural selection.

605
00:44:01,551 --> 00:44:04,748
And we're made of trillions of cells.

606
00:44:04,955 --> 00:44:07,947
We are, each of us, a multitude.

607
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:12,619
Within us is a little universe.

608
00:44:28,879 --> 00:44:33,816
Human DNA is a coiled ladder...

609
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:36,314
...a billion nucleotides long.

610
00:44:36,853 --> 00:44:41,187
Many possible combinations of
nucleotides are nonsense. That is...

611
00:44:41,391 --> 00:44:45,760
...they translate into proteins which
serve no useful function whatever.

612
00:44:45,962 --> 00:44:49,193
Only a comparatively few
nucleic acid molecules...

613
00:44:49,399 --> 00:44:54,063
...are any good for life forms
as complicated as we are.

614
00:44:54,838 --> 00:44:59,036
But even so, the number of useful ways
of assembling nucleic acids...

615
00:44:59,242 --> 00:45:01,403
...is stupefyingly large.

616
00:45:01,611 --> 00:45:06,480
It's probably larger than the total
number of atoms in the universe.

617
00:45:06,683 --> 00:45:11,620
This means that the number of
possible kinds of human beings...

618
00:45:11,922 --> 00:45:16,552
...is vastly greater than the number
of human beings that has ever lived.

619
00:45:16,793 --> 00:45:21,025
This untapped potential of
the human species is immense.

620
00:45:21,231 --> 00:45:23,893
There are ways of
putting nucleic acids together...

621
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:28,366
...which will function far better
by any criterion you wish to choose...

622
00:45:28,572 --> 00:45:33,509
...than the hereditary instructions of
any human being who has ever lived.

623
00:45:33,944 --> 00:45:38,404
Fortunately, we do not know,
or at least do not yet know...

624
00:45:38,615 --> 00:45:43,143
...how to assemble alternative
sequences of nucleotides...

625
00:45:43,353 --> 00:45:46,720
...to make alternative kinds
of human beings.

626
00:45:46,923 --> 00:45:50,450
In the future, we might be able
to put nucleotides together...

627
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,389
...in any desired sequence...

628
00:45:52,596 --> 00:45:55,997
...to produce human characteristics
we think desirable.

629
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,959
A disquieting and awesome prospect.

630
00:46:11,748 --> 00:46:15,912
We human beings don't look
very much like a tree.

631
00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:20,146
We certainly view the world
differently than a tree does.

632
00:46:20,357 --> 00:46:23,815
But down deep,
at the molecular heart of life...

633
00:46:24,027 --> 00:46:27,190
...we're essentially
identical to trees.

634
00:46:27,764 --> 00:46:32,633
We both use nucleic acids
as the hereditary material.

635
00:46:32,836 --> 00:46:37,739
We both use proteins as enzymes
to control the chemistry of the cell.

636
00:46:39,109 --> 00:46:43,637
And most significantly,
we both use the identical code book...

637
00:46:43,847 --> 00:46:48,750
...to translate nucleic acid information
into protein information.

638
00:46:48,952 --> 00:46:53,321
Any tree could read my genetic code.

639
00:46:54,257 --> 00:46:56,782
How did such astonishing similarities
come about?

640
00:46:56,993 --> 00:47:01,123
Why are we cousins to the trees?

641
00:47:01,331 --> 00:47:04,459
Would life on some other planet
use proteins?

642
00:47:04,668 --> 00:47:09,605
The same proteins? The same nucleic
acids? The same genetic code?

643
00:47:10,307 --> 00:47:13,140
The usual explanation
is that we are...

644
00:47:13,343 --> 00:47:16,904
...all of us, trees and people...

645
00:47:17,113 --> 00:47:21,948
...anglerfish, slime molds,
bacteria...

646
00:47:22,152 --> 00:47:25,781
...all descended from a single
and common instance...

647
00:47:25,989 --> 00:47:28,856
...of the origin of life
4 billion years ago...

648
00:47:29,059 --> 00:47:31,220
...in the early days of our planet.

649
00:47:32,062 --> 00:47:33,859
Now, how...

650
00:47:34,064 --> 00:47:37,465
...did the molecules
of life arise?

651
00:47:39,035 --> 00:47:40,400
(THUNDER)

652
00:47:43,473 --> 00:47:45,236
(LIGHTNING BUZZES)

653
00:47:55,819 --> 00:47:58,117
In a laboratory
at Cornell University...

654
00:47:58,555 --> 00:48:02,184
...we mix together the gases
and waters of the primitive Earth...

655
00:48:02,392 --> 00:48:03,825
...supply some energy...

656
00:48:04,027 --> 00:48:07,622
...and see if we can make
the stuff of life.

657
00:48:20,243 --> 00:48:24,475
But what was the early atmosphere
made of, ordinary air?

658
00:48:24,681 --> 00:48:26,706
If we start with
our present atmosphere...

659
00:48:26,916 --> 00:48:29,316
...the experiment is a dismal failure.

660
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:32,317
Instead of making proteins
and nucleic acids...

661
00:48:32,522 --> 00:48:35,923
...all we make is smog,
a backwards step.

662
00:48:36,126 --> 00:48:38,185
Why doesn't such an experiment work?

663
00:48:38,395 --> 00:48:41,956
Because the air of today
contains molecular oxygen.

664
00:48:42,165 --> 00:48:44,463
But oxygen is made by plants.

665
00:48:44,667 --> 00:48:48,296
It's obvious that there were
no plants before the origin of life.

666
00:48:48,505 --> 00:48:50,735
We mustn't use oxygen
in our experiments...

667
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:53,807
...because there wasn't any
in the early atmosphere.

668
00:48:59,115 --> 00:49:03,347
This is reasonable because the cosmos
is made mostly of hydrogen...

669
00:49:03,553 --> 00:49:05,020
...which gobbles oxygen up.

670
00:49:05,221 --> 00:49:09,317
The Earth's low gravity has
allowed most of our hydrogen gas...

671
00:49:09,526 --> 00:49:13,223
...to trickle away to space.
There's almost none left.

672
00:49:14,197 --> 00:49:15,630
But 4 billion years ago...

673
00:49:15,832 --> 00:49:18,892
...our atmosphere was full
of hydrogen-rich gases:

674
00:49:19,102 --> 00:49:21,593
Methane, ammonia, water vapor.

675
00:49:21,805 --> 00:49:24,273
These are the gases we should use.

676
00:49:29,245 --> 00:49:32,214
Taking great care to ensure
the purity of these gases...

677

...my colleague, Bishun Khare,
pumps them from their holding flasks.

678

An experiment like this
was first performed...

and Harold Urey in the 1950s.

The starting gases are now introduced
into a large reaction vessel.

682
00:50:18,194 --> 00:50:22,392
We could shine ultraviolet light,
simulating the early sun.

683
00:50:22,599 --> 00:50:23,964
But in this experiment...

684
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,464
...the gases will be sparked...

...as the primitive atmosphere was

(LIGHTNING BUZZES)

687

After only a few hours,
the interior of the reaction vessel...

688
00:50:55,965 --> 00:50:59,093
...becomes streaked with
a strange brown pigment...

689
00:50:59,302 --> 00:51:02,829
...a rich collection
of complex organic molecules...

690
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:07,601
...including the building blocks of
the proteins and the nucleic acids.

691
00:51:09,812 --> 00:51:13,441
Under the right conditions, these
building blocks assemble themselves...

692
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:18,110
...into molecules resembling little
proteins and little nucleic acids.

693
00:51:18,321 --> 00:51:22,849
These nucleic acids can even make
identical copies of themselves.

694
00:51:28,298 --> 00:51:32,701
In this vessel are the notes
of the music of life...

695
00:51:32,902 --> 00:51:35,769
...although not yet the music itself.

696
00:51:38,308 --> 00:51:40,742
Now, no one, so far...

697
00:51:40,944 --> 00:51:45,313
...has mixed together the gases
and waters of the primitive Earth...

698
00:51:45,515 --> 00:51:50,452
...and at the end of the experiment
had something crawl out of the flask.

699
00:51:50,687 --> 00:51:54,316
There's still much to be understood
about the origin of life...

700
00:51:54,524 --> 00:51:56,856
...including the origin
of the genetic code.

701
00:51:57,060 --> 00:52:00,518
But we've only been at
such experiments for 30 years.

702
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:04,029
Nature's had
a 4-billion-year head start.

703
00:52:04,233 --> 00:52:08,829
Incidentally, there's nothing in such
experiments that's unique to the Earth.

704
00:52:09,038 --> 00:52:12,633
The gases we start with,
the energy sources we use...

705
00:52:12,842 --> 00:52:15,572
...are entirely common
through the cosmos.

706
00:52:15,778 --> 00:52:20,306
So chemical reactions something like
these must be responsible for...

707
00:52:20,516 --> 00:52:22,677
...the organic matter
in interstellar space...

708
00:52:22,885 --> 00:52:25,251
...and the amino acids
in the meteorites.

709
00:52:25,455 --> 00:52:28,288
Similar chemical reactions
must have occurred...

710
00:52:28,491 --> 00:52:31,927
...on a billion other worlds
in the Milky Way galaxy.

711
00:52:32,128 --> 00:52:36,087
Look how easy it is to make
great globs of this stuff.

712
00:52:36,299 --> 00:52:40,565
The molecules of life fill the cosmos.

713
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:42,228
Now...

714
00:52:42,772 --> 00:52:45,605
What would life elsewhere look like?

715
00:52:45,808 --> 00:52:49,801
Even if it had an identical molecular
chemistry to life on Earth...

716
00:52:50,013 --> 00:52:51,844
...which I very much doubt...

717
00:52:52,048 --> 00:52:55,609
...it could not be
very similar in form...

718
00:52:55,818 --> 00:52:58,082
...to familiar organisms on the Earth.

719
00:52:58,287 --> 00:53:01,450
The random character of
the evolutionary process...

720
00:53:01,658 --> 00:53:06,493
...must create elsewhere creatures
very different from any that we know.

721
00:53:08,264 --> 00:53:10,892
Think of a world
something like Jupiter...

722
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:15,662
...with an atmosphere rich in hydrogen,
helium, methane, water and ammonia...

723
00:53:15,872 --> 00:53:17,533
...in which organic molecules
might be...

724
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:20,470
...falling from the skies
like manna from heaven...

725
00:53:20,677 --> 00:53:23,237
...like the products of
the Miller-Urey experiment.

726
00:53:23,446 --> 00:53:25,937
Could there be life on such a world?

727
00:53:26,883 --> 00:53:30,444
There's a special problem.
The atmosphere is turbulent...

728
00:53:30,653 --> 00:53:34,282
...and down deep, before we ever
come to a surface, it's very hot.

729
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:38,153
If you're not careful,
you'll be carried down and fried.

730
00:53:38,361 --> 00:53:41,194
If you reproduce
before you're fried...

731
00:53:41,397 --> 00:53:46,096
...turbulence will carry your offspring
into the higher and cooler layers.

732
00:53:46,302 --> 00:53:51,001
Such organisms could be very little.
We call them sinkers.

733
00:53:52,442 --> 00:53:55,570
The physicist E.E. Salpeter and I
at Cornell...

734
00:53:55,778 --> 00:53:58,372
...have calculated
something about the life...

735
00:53:58,581 --> 00:54:01,072
...that might exist on such a world.

736
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:06,384
Vast living balloons could
stay buoyant...

737
00:54:06,589 --> 00:54:09,752
...by pumping heavy gases
from their interiors...

738
00:54:09,959 --> 00:54:11,950
...or by keeping their insides warm.

739
00:54:12,161 --> 00:54:14,891
They might eat the organic molecules
in the air...

740
00:54:15,098 --> 00:54:16,963
...or make their own with sunlight.

741
00:54:17,166 --> 00:54:20,499
We call these creatures floaters.

742
00:54:22,171 --> 00:54:24,537
We imagine floaters
kilometers across...

743
00:54:24,741 --> 00:54:28,177
...enormously larger than
the greatest whale that ever was...

744
00:54:28,377 --> 00:54:31,778
...beings the size of cities.

745
00:54:31,981 --> 00:54:35,883
We conceive of them arrayed
in great, lazy herds...

746
00:54:36,085 --> 00:54:37,916
...as far as the eye can see...

747
00:54:38,121 --> 00:54:42,820
...concentrated in the updrafts
in the enormous sea of clouds.

748
00:54:43,025 --> 00:54:47,291
But there can be other creatures
in this alien environment: hunters.

749
00:54:49,165 --> 00:54:51,326
Hunters are fast and maneuverable.

750
00:54:51,534 --> 00:54:54,833
They eat the floaters,
both for their organic molecules...

751
00:54:55,037 --> 00:54:57,130
...and for their store
of pure hydrogen.

752
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:59,035
But there can't be many hunters...

753
00:54:59,242 --> 00:55:03,906
...because if they destroy all the
floaters, they themselves will perish.

754
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:10,578
Physics and chemistry permit
such life forms.

755
00:55:10,787 --> 00:55:13,255
Art presents them with
a certain reality...

756
00:55:13,456 --> 00:55:17,119
...but nature is not obliged
to follow our speculations.

757
00:55:17,326 --> 00:55:21,922
If there are billions of inhabited
worlds in the Milky Way galaxy...

758
00:55:22,365 --> 00:55:26,859
...then I think it's likely there are
a few places which might have...

759
00:55:27,069 --> 00:55:28,468
...hunters...

760
00:55:28,671 --> 00:55:31,469
...and floaters and sinkers.

761
00:55:32,708 --> 00:55:36,940
Biology is more like history
than it is like physics.

762
00:55:37,146 --> 00:55:40,206
You have to know the past
to understand the present.

763
00:55:40,416 --> 00:55:44,580
There is no predictive theory of
biology, nor is there for history.

764
00:55:44,787 --> 00:55:46,152
The reason is the same:

765
00:55:46,355 --> 00:55:49,688
Both subjects are still
too complicated for us.

766
00:55:49,892 --> 00:55:52,520
But we can understand ourselves
much better...

767
00:55:52,728 --> 00:55:54,958
...by understanding other cases.

768
00:55:56,632 --> 00:56:00,090
The study of a single instance
of extraterrestrial life...

769
00:56:00,303 --> 00:56:03,795
No matter how humble,
a microbe would be just fine.

770
00:56:04,006 --> 00:56:06,941
...will de-provincialize biology.

771
00:56:07,143 --> 00:56:10,738
It will show us what else is possible.

772
00:56:12,215 --> 00:56:17,152
We've heard so far the voice
of life on only a single world...

773
00:56:17,386 --> 00:56:19,752
...but for the first time,
as we shall see...

774
00:56:19,956 --> 00:56:23,414
...we've begun
a serious scientific search...

775
00:56:23,626 --> 00:56:25,856
...for the cosmic fugue.

776
00:56:36,072 --> 00:56:39,337
Recently, we've learned more
about the origin of life.

777
00:56:39,542 --> 00:56:41,669
Do you remember RNA...

778
00:56:41,878 --> 00:56:45,245
...that nucleic acid
that our cells use as messengers...

779
00:56:45,448 --> 00:56:48,576
...carrying the genetic information
out of the cell nucleus?

780
00:56:49,252 --> 00:56:53,484
Well, it's been found that RNA,
like protein...

781
00:56:53,689 --> 00:56:55,953
...can control chemical reactions...

782
00:56:56,158 --> 00:56:59,821
...as well as reproduce itself,
which proteins can't do.

783
00:57:00,029 --> 00:57:03,260
Many scientists now wonder
if the first life on Earth...

784
00:57:03,466 --> 00:57:05,627
...was an RNA molecule.

785
00:57:05,835 --> 00:57:09,293
It now seems feasible that
key molecular building blocks...

786
00:57:09,505 --> 00:57:13,441
...for the origin of life, fell out
of the skies 4 billion years ago.

787
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:18,613
Comets have been found to have a lot
of organic molecules in them...

788
00:57:18,814 --> 00:57:23,148
...and they fell in huge numbers
on the primitive Earth.

789
00:57:24,253 --> 00:57:27,086
We also mention the extinction
of the dinosaurs...

790
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:31,226
...and most of the other species on
Earth about 65 million years ago.

791
00:57:31,427 --> 00:57:35,591
We now know that a large comet
hit the Earth at just that time.

792
00:57:35,798 --> 00:57:40,735
The dust pall from that collision
must've cooled and darkened the Earth...

793
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:44,005
...perhaps killing all
the dinosaurs, but sparing...

794
00:57:44,206 --> 00:57:48,666
...the small, furry mammals
who were our ancestors.

795
00:57:48,878 --> 00:57:52,746
Other cometary mass extinctions
in other epochs seem likely.

796
00:57:52,949 --> 00:57:57,283
If true, this would mean that
comets have been the bringers...

797
00:57:57,486 --> 00:57:59,954
...both of life and death.
