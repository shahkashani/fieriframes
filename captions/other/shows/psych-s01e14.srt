1
00:00:01,134 --> 00:00:02,862
I'll raise.

2
00:00:02,863 --> 00:00:05,370
I've got a good feeling
about this hand.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,199
Too rich for me. Fold.

4
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:14,443
Big surprise, rookie. That's
all you ever do is fold.

5
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:18,079
Call. What do you say to that,
big shot?

6
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:24,188
I say...

7
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:31,260
The last card didn't make
Mr. O'Grady's flush.

8
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,257
Mr. Duritz was smart to fold
'cause he missed his straight.

9
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:46,205
And you, Mr. Hastings,
your cards just stink.

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,171
You're bluffing. I call.

11
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:54,014
Two pair, Jacks and 7 s.
Oh! Damn it!

12
00:00:54,015 --> 00:00:55,553
Every time.

13
00:00:55,554 --> 00:00:56,781
You'd think
we'd know better by now.

14
00:00:56,782 --> 00:00:59,121
What the hell is
goin' on here?

15
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,929
Poker, Shawn? Poker?

16
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,825
What were you thinking?

17
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:09,200
I don't know.
I get bored waiting.

18
00:01:09,201 --> 00:01:10,860
Oh, well, why didn't
you just say so?

19
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:13,235
I mean, if you're bored,
I guess it's okay.

20
00:01:13,236 --> 00:01:15,206
What is wrong with you?

21
00:01:15,207 --> 00:01:17,572
How do you even know
how to play poker?

22
00:01:17,573 --> 00:01:19,109
Mr. Hastings taught me.

23
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,645
Hastings, uh?

24
00:01:20,646 --> 00:01:22,577
Well, I want it to stop.
Do you understand?

25
00:01:22,578 --> 00:01:24,445
No more poker, no more
gambling. You're too young.

26
00:01:24,446 --> 00:01:26,382
Dad, I don't gamble.
I win.

27
00:01:26,383 --> 00:01:28,477
You win? Oh, uh-huh.

28
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:30,419
And approximately
how often do you lose?

29
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,252
I don't know.
You don't know.

30
00:01:32,253 --> 00:01:33,953
Well, I haven't lost yet.

31
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:37,987
How much?
How much did you win?

32
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:46,499
Is that it?

33
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:54,810
All right, son,
listen to me.

34
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,445
Just because
you can do something

35
00:01:57,446 --> 00:01:59,177
doesn't always mean
that you should do it,

36
00:01:59,178 --> 00:02:00,479
do you understand
what I'm saying?

37
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,612
No.

38
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,651
Hey, that's mine!

39
00:02:04,652 --> 00:02:05,713
Not anymore.

40
00:02:05,714 --> 00:02:06,815
Yes, it is!

41
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:09,156
Uh-uh, no. No, no, no, no.
I'm giving it away.

42
00:02:09,157 --> 00:02:11,025
Giving it away.
Why? Because I can.

43
00:02:11,026 --> 00:02:13,895
And according to your little
philosophy, your poker philosophy,

44
00:02:13,896 --> 00:02:16,435
if I can,
then I should, right?

45
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,542
I know it might seem like you're
gonna win every time, Shawn,

46
00:02:24,543 --> 00:02:26,202
but no matter
how good you are,

47
00:02:26,203 --> 00:02:28,213
there's always somebody
who's better.

48
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,709
And there's one rule
in gambling,

49
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,511
the house always wins.
Eventually.

50
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,122
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

51
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:38,383
Don't gamble.

52
00:02:38,384 --> 00:02:39,789
Not for money.

53
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,487
I got 10 bucks says
you can't make this shot. Ooh!

54
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,824
Gus, I can't take your money.

55
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,123
That's right. 'Cause
you can't make the shot.

56
00:02:48,124 --> 00:02:49,497
I could easily
make the shot,

57
00:02:49,498 --> 00:02:52,561
which is why I can't take your
money. There's no sport in it.

58
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,567
I say you're all mouth.

59
00:02:54,568 --> 00:02:56,336
I'm all mouth?
Yep.

60
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,268
All right.

61
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,120
Sail straight,
my precious.

62
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:23,001
Okay. Double or nothing.

63
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:24,661
Trivia question this time.
History.

64
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,398
Grover Cleveland.
Damn!

65
00:03:26,399 --> 00:03:28,839
How do you do that?
It's the sweetness.

66
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,701
So, this is how
you spend your days.

67
00:03:31,702 --> 00:03:34,268
Oh, my God! Dad, what
are you doing here?

68
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:37,406
Nice. Is that the way you greet all
the people that come through your door?

69
00:03:37,407 --> 00:03:39,007
That's exactly
how I greet everyone.

70
00:03:39,008 --> 00:03:40,950
Maybe that's why
business is down. Hmm.

71
00:03:40,951 --> 00:03:42,282
Are you gonna invite me in?

72
00:03:42,283 --> 00:03:43,753
Oh, yeah, please...
No!

73
00:03:43,754 --> 00:03:45,085
This could be a trick.

74
00:03:45,086 --> 00:03:47,625
What's the rule with vampires,
don't they have to be invited in?

75
00:03:47,626 --> 00:03:48,819
What are you talking about,
Shawn?

76
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,829
<i>Gus, you've seen Lost Boys
14 times. What's the rule?</i>

77
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,432
You're on your own.

78
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,030
Is this all there is?

79
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,206
Actually, this is
the, uh, satellite office.

80
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:04,106
Main headquarters is
in an underground ice cave

81
00:04:04,107 --> 00:04:06,406
Gus and I sculpted
last winter.

82
00:04:06,407 --> 00:04:07,776
What about your license?

83
00:04:07,777 --> 00:04:10,782
Ahem, my pilot's license?
It's out back in the Cessna.

84
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:13,819
Or perhaps you're referring
to my license to kill.

85
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,911
Revoked. Problems
at the Kazakhstan border.

86
00:04:15,912 --> 00:04:17,922
I could give you the details,
but then I'd have to kill you,

87
00:04:17,923 --> 00:04:20,823
which I can't do because my
license to kill has been revoked.

88
00:04:20,824 --> 00:04:23,555
I'm talkin' about
your private eye license.

89
00:04:23,556 --> 00:04:25,755
Well, you need one, don't ya?

90
00:04:25,756 --> 00:04:27,856
Psychics are exempt
from the requirements.

91
00:04:27,857 --> 00:04:31,062
Oh, well,
hurray for loopholes!

92
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,167
A little dark.

93
00:04:35,168 --> 00:04:38,506
Probably could use a couple more lamps,
you know, probably killing your eyes.

94
00:04:38,507 --> 00:04:41,978
That outlet... Ah, yeah,
looks a little overloaded.

95
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:45,107
Yeah, I think that plasma, you'd probably
do better by puttin' it on that wall,

96
00:04:45,108 --> 00:04:47,846
you'd have less glare comin' in
through the window in the afternoon.

97
00:04:47,847 --> 00:04:49,945
You know what, Dad, I really appreciate
you makin' the long drive down

98
00:04:49,946 --> 00:04:51,046
and Feng Shui it up
sweet for us,

99
00:04:51,047 --> 00:04:52,351
but we're kind of in the
middle of something here.

100
00:04:52,352 --> 00:04:55,189
What would that be, Shawn?
Would that be NBA

101
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:59,124
garbage can hoops,
or trivia super challenge?

102
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,927
Believe it or not,
we have an 11:00.

103
00:05:00,928 --> 00:05:02,797
So maybe
we should wrap this up.

104
00:05:02,798 --> 00:05:05,463
Yeah, it's a little too late
for that, Shawn.

105
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,607
I am your 11:00.

106
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:20,952
<i>I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth</i>

107
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:24,046
<i>I know, you know
They just don't have any proof</i>

108
00:05:24,047 --> 00:05:27,251
<i>Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend</i>

109
00:05:27,252 --> 00:05:31,693
<i>Your worst inhibitions tend
to psych you out in the end</i>

110
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,972
Bill Peterson.
He owns Peterson Motors.

111
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:43,234
Met him about 20 years ago
when I grabbed a couple of punks

112
00:05:43,235 --> 00:05:44,867
boosting tires
off of his lot.

113
00:05:44,868 --> 00:05:46,673
Shawn, shouldn't you be
writing some of this down?

114
00:05:46,674 --> 00:05:48,679
Why would I do that?
Will there be a quiz?

115
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,647
Just shut up
and pay attention.

116
00:05:50,648 --> 00:05:53,310
I got a call from him yesterday.
He's got a kid, Brandon.

117
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,376
He's just a little younger
than you.

118
00:05:55,377 --> 00:05:57,285
He thinks his son might be
mixed up in something.

119
00:05:57,286 --> 00:05:59,119
Like what? Well, he'll fill
you in when he gets here.

120
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,682
The point is, he doesn't want the
cops involved. So, he called me.

121
00:06:01,683 --> 00:06:04,320
And you said...
I said I'm retired

122
00:06:04,321 --> 00:06:06,023
and he should definitely
involve the cops.

123
00:06:06,024 --> 00:06:08,931
Sweet. You came all the way down
here to tell us that. Awesome.

124
00:06:08,932 --> 00:06:11,367
No, Shawn. He doesn't want
his son in trouble,

125
00:06:11,368 --> 00:06:15,272
and I might have mentioned to
Peterson accidentally that, you, uh...

126
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,802
You might be able to help.

127
00:06:17,803 --> 00:06:21,074
Whoa, time out! Flag on the
play! Did you vouch for me?

128
00:06:21,075 --> 00:06:23,239
No, I wouldn't say
I exactly vouched for you.

129
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,340
Gus, Henry vouched for me.
I did not vouch for you!

130
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:28,113
You were bragging on me.
You have a dad-crush on me.

131
00:06:28,114 --> 00:06:29,620
Shawn, I was not
bragging on you.

132
00:06:29,621 --> 00:06:33,954
I merely restated stats about your
track record that are in the newspaper.

133
00:06:33,955 --> 00:06:35,617
Let's hug it out.
Put your arms down.

134
00:06:35,618 --> 00:06:37,184
Gimme a hug. Put your... No,
I'm not gonna give you...

135
00:06:37,185 --> 00:06:39,754
If I'd known that Peterson was
gonna insist on hiring you,

136
00:06:39,755 --> 00:06:41,356
I would've blasted
your character outright

137
00:06:41,357 --> 00:06:44,459
and I would've mentioned your
unnatural fear of pointy things.

138
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,504
Ah!
Distaste for pointy things.

139
00:06:46,505 --> 00:06:48,335
Please,
just do me this one favor.

140
00:06:48,336 --> 00:06:51,001
Would you listen to the man's
story, tell him you can't help?

141
00:06:51,002 --> 00:06:52,941
Send him to the cops,
and whatever you do,

142
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:56,175
don't do it with all that
rolling your eyes around

143
00:06:56,176 --> 00:06:58,842
and all that floppy crap.

144
00:06:58,843 --> 00:06:59,976
What is this?

145
00:06:59,977 --> 00:07:02,213
First of all, I don't flop
around all the time, okay?

146
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,222
My game is predicated
on finesse.

147
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:06,087
How dare you criticize my
job? He's here, he's here.

148
00:07:06,088 --> 00:07:07,284
Okay, don't tell him
I came by.

149
00:07:07,285 --> 00:07:09,725
You got a back way out of this
place? You came through it.

150
00:07:09,726 --> 00:07:10,820
Oh, right.

151
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:17,761
Excuse me, you Shawn?

152
00:07:17,762 --> 00:07:20,271
Yes, that's correct,
Mr. Peterson.

153
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,304
Wow, that is my name.

154
00:07:24,305 --> 00:07:26,276
Don't be
too impressed, Bill,

155
00:07:26,277 --> 00:07:28,142
I could have gotten
that information anywhere.

156
00:07:28,143 --> 00:07:30,511
After all,
Peterson Motors is gigantic.

157
00:07:30,512 --> 00:07:32,584
Yeah, well,
I'm suitably impressed.

158
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,312
Don't be. Burton Guster.

159
00:07:34,313 --> 00:07:35,614
Pleasure to meet you.

160
00:07:35,615 --> 00:07:38,088
Look, I'll get right to it.
I have a son, Brandon.

161
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:40,853
Up until a few weeks ago, he
worked for me. Now he's disappeared.

162
00:07:40,854 --> 00:07:43,258
What happened a few
weeks ago? I fired him.

163
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:44,954
He was lazy,
directionless.

164
00:07:44,955 --> 00:07:47,828
I thought I could get him to
buckle down, focus in on something.

165
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:49,094
How did that go?

166
00:07:49,095 --> 00:07:52,331
Well, he's been evicted from his
apartment, his cell phone's been cut off

167
00:07:52,332 --> 00:07:56,341
and he forged a check from my
account to the tune of $30,000.

168
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,774
I need to find my son.
Can you help me?

169
00:07:59,775 --> 00:08:01,938
Well, Mr. Peterson, this sounds
like a case for the police.

170
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,072
Let me get you a number.

171
00:08:03,073 --> 00:08:05,139
Gus, don't be a gooey
chocolate chip cookie. What?

172
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,844
This is precisely
what we do here, sir.

173
00:08:06,845 --> 00:08:09,616
We find people.
We'll find your Brandon.

174
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,788
Okay, make sure
we are not disturbed.

175
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:21,026
I need five minutes uninterrupted.
Make sure no one comes in.

176
00:08:21,027 --> 00:08:22,159
Yeah.

177
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,238
What's with
all the secrecy, O'Hara?

178
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:32,937
I've got a real mindbender.

179
00:08:32,938 --> 00:08:34,843
Problem with
the railway theft?

180
00:08:34,844 --> 00:08:37,245
No. It's a detective.

181
00:08:37,246 --> 00:08:39,341
Is this something
for Internal Affairs?

182
00:08:39,342 --> 00:08:41,079
It's Detective Lassiter.

183
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,643
What's the problem
with our Head Detective?

184
00:08:42,644 --> 00:08:43,881
Well, it's his birthday.

185
00:08:43,882 --> 00:08:45,856
Oh, that's not a problem.

186
00:08:45,857 --> 00:08:48,324
Yeah! It is!
He seems quiet.

187
00:08:48,325 --> 00:08:50,191
He is quiet.
That's who he is.

188
00:08:50,192 --> 00:08:52,321
Look, O'Hara, I think it's nice
that you care for your partner,

189
00:08:52,322 --> 00:08:54,491
but he is a grown man.
He'll be fine.

190
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,330
I just thought it would
be nice to surprise him.

191
00:08:57,331 --> 00:08:58,496
Oh...

192
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:01,132
Detective Lassiter
does not like surprises.

193
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:03,140
Of course he likes surprises.
Everybody likes surprises.

194
00:09:03,141 --> 00:09:06,700
Detective Lassiter has a
very particular comfort zone.

195
00:09:06,701 --> 00:09:10,647
And you don't even wanna know what we now
call the Secret Santa Debacle of 2005.

196
00:09:10,648 --> 00:09:13,082
I just wanted to do
something nice for him,

197
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,278
but nobody seems to know
what he likes!

198
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,720
Well, you're his partner,
shouldn't you know?

199
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,258
Well, we don't really talk.

200
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,216
I mean, he doesn't.

201
00:09:22,217 --> 00:09:26,958
He nods and responds mostly. He
never really poses a question.

202
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,059
Although sometimes he asks
if we can ride in silence.

203
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,833
O'Hara, your heart
is in the right place,

204
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:36,939
but I am very sure that you're
gonna have to do this yourself.

205
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,477
Okay, fine.

206
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:46,140
Shawn, what are we doin' here?

207
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:48,243
Brandon's dad said
he was evicted.

208
00:09:48,244 --> 00:09:50,185
Gus, let me
ask you something.

209
00:09:50,186 --> 00:09:52,416
When's the last time you were
evicted from your apartment?

210
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:53,652
Never!

211
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,060
Exactly.
You wouldn't understand.

212
00:09:58,061 --> 00:09:59,564
This is my world.

213
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,827
So the landlord keeps
Brandon's stuff as collateral.

214
00:10:05,828 --> 00:10:07,633
Brandon comes back,
the landlord gets paid,

215
00:10:07,634 --> 00:10:09,571
Brandon doesn't,
there's a garage sale.

216
00:10:09,572 --> 00:10:11,541
Well, the buzzer upstairs
says that his is 227.

217
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:13,840
<i>227? Marla Gibbs.
Regina King.</i>

218
00:10:13,841 --> 00:10:15,379
Jackée!
Hal Williams.

219
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,642
Hal Williams? Hal
Williams as Lester Jenkins.

220
00:10:17,643 --> 00:10:19,048
Yeah, right.

221
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,452
Looks like somebody took a
screwdriver to this thing.

222
00:10:25,453 --> 00:10:26,753
Lemme see.

223
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,853
Okay, so Brandon needed something
inside here, but he couldn't get in.

224
00:10:30,854 --> 00:10:32,829
If you were in his shoes,
what would you do next?

225
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,798
First of all, I'd feel
very ashamed of myself.

226
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:36,460
Tell me about it.

227
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,210
But then,

228
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,407
I think I'd come back
with some scissors.

229
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:54,418
Let's see if we can find
what he's reaching for.

230
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:56,317
Yeah, lemme reach.
My reach is better.

231
00:10:56,318 --> 00:10:57,582
Excuse me?
What?

232
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,351
When exactly did we have
a reaching contest?

233
00:10:59,352 --> 00:11:00,482
My reach has always
been better.

234
00:11:00,483 --> 00:11:03,653
But my arms are slender-erer.
Slender-erer?

235
00:11:03,654 --> 00:11:06,493
What?
Slendererer...

236
00:11:06,494 --> 00:11:07,964
Skinnier?
Yes.

237
00:11:07,965 --> 00:11:11,560
You know what? You're right. My biceps
probably wouldn't fit through this thing anyway.

238
00:11:11,561 --> 00:11:13,697
I knew you'd fall for that!

239
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:23,172
Let me see.

240
00:11:23,173 --> 00:11:28,117
Hmm. Final notice, final notice,
final notice, plus an eviction?

241
00:11:28,118 --> 00:11:30,815
Gosh, this kid has some
serious cash flow problems.

242
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:33,017
No wonder why
he stole from his pops.

243
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,687
What do you got?
A bunch of pawnshops.

244
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,794
Whoa! Wait a second.

245
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:39,826
If you're a guy
with an apartment,

246
00:11:39,827 --> 00:11:41,957
what's the one thing
you definitely don't have?

247
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,365
I don't know. A horse?

248
00:11:43,366 --> 00:11:44,960
A horse, that's true!

249
00:11:46,062 --> 00:11:48,663
Answer we were looking for
was yard or garden.

250
00:11:48,664 --> 00:11:51,231
I would have accepted
both yard and garden.

251
00:11:51,232 --> 00:11:52,334
I was joking, Shawn.

252
00:11:52,335 --> 00:11:54,606
So if you're a guy without
a yard or a garden... Shawn!

253
00:11:54,607 --> 00:11:57,582
...why would you have a business
card for a garden supply store?

254
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:00,042
What is R-R-L-R-L-L?

255
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,117
Rrlrll. Rrlrll.

256
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,652
Of course. Rrlrll.

257
00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:08,659
No, no. Rrlrll! Rrlrll.

258
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,716
What does it mean?

259
00:12:09,717 --> 00:12:11,696
We should probably figure
that out, huh? You think?

260
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,762
How long are we
gonna sit here?

261
00:12:14,763 --> 00:12:16,391
Brandon might not even
show up.

262
00:12:16,392 --> 00:12:18,368
When I suggested we do a
stakeout, you were, like,

263
00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:20,735
"No, no, we need to do
something active."

264
00:12:20,736 --> 00:12:22,672
I am doing something
active. What?

265
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,977
I'm preparing to try
and enjoy this chalupa.

266
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:27,570
Odd.

267
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,909
No, what's odd, the customers
that keep driving into this place.

268
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,457
Look at these cars.
They're ridiculous!

269
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,191
They're all fancy
and what not.

270
00:12:41,192 --> 00:12:44,492
Not exactly what you'd use to
pick up shrubs and fertilizer.

271
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,295
Let's see what
these people are up to.

272
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:35,942
Let's go!

273
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,010
Ah!

274
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,525
Wrong turn.

275
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,235
What the...

276
00:14:00,236 --> 00:14:03,434
Dude, it's a maze.

277
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,103
<i>What is "R-R-L-R-L-L"?</i>

278
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:07,636
Shawn, what are you doing?

279
00:14:07,637 --> 00:14:09,613
Right, right.

280
00:14:09,614 --> 00:14:13,015
Dude, the letters on the back
of that card were directions.

281
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,811
Follow me.
All right.

282
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,581
Right.

283
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:23,959
Rrlrll...

284
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:26,264
Rrlrll, rrlrll.
Shawn!

285
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,424
Right.

286
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:29,662
Left...

287
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,461
Left...

288
00:14:31,462 --> 00:14:33,470
Yes!

289
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,096
Whoa, wait a second.
Wait a second.

290
00:14:35,097 --> 00:14:38,701
Maybe we should take a peek and
see what we're getting into, Shawn.

291
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,314
Ooh, you know
what this is, Shawn?

292
00:14:46,315 --> 00:14:47,852
It's one of those
underground poker games.

293
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,443
My poker buddies
talk about them.

294
00:14:49,444 --> 00:14:50,920
Since when do you have
poker buddies?

295
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:52,889
My online poker buddies,
Shawn.

296
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:55,359
I'm good.
I'm up $7 million dollars.

297
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:00,287
You have $7 million dollars and you
failed to mention it to me till just now?

298
00:15:00,288 --> 00:15:03,199
It's not real money, Shawn.
That's illegal.

299
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,937
Rough luck there again, huh?

300
00:15:06,938 --> 00:15:08,097
Yeah, a bit of bad luck.

301
00:15:08,098 --> 00:15:10,198
Dude, you should get
in this game. How?

302
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,470
These games are tight. You
gotta know somebody to get in.

303
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:14,910
Well, let's just throw Brandon's
name around, maybe they'll let us in.

304
00:15:14,911 --> 00:15:17,039
Uh, yeah, one more hand,
I'll get it.

305
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,447
It's just not working out for you
today, is it? No. Not right now.

306
00:15:19,448 --> 00:15:21,247
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you stand up here?

307
00:15:21,248 --> 00:15:23,117
I'm just gonna...
Come on. Come here.

308
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:25,680
It's okay. It's okay.

309
00:15:25,681 --> 00:15:27,281
Okay.
Just relax now.

310
00:15:27,282 --> 00:15:28,792
Put your hand up
like this. Why?

311
00:15:28,793 --> 00:15:30,384
Just hold it up.
There you go.

312
00:15:30,385 --> 00:15:33,488
Now, maybe next time,
you won't force me

313
00:15:33,489 --> 00:15:35,396
into such a barbaric form
of retribution.

314
00:15:35,397 --> 00:15:38,368
Good news, there appears
to be a seat opening up.

315
00:15:38,369 --> 00:15:40,530
Still, I think our best
course of action would be...

316
00:15:40,531 --> 00:15:41,902
Get the hell outta here!
Go!

317
00:15:41,903 --> 00:15:43,839
Go! Go, go!

318
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,608
I want you to know I cannot
hear anything you say!

319
00:15:49,609 --> 00:15:50,705
Shawn,
what the hell is going on?

320
00:15:50,706 --> 00:15:52,443
What the...
Shawn, what are you doing?

321
00:15:52,444 --> 00:15:54,314
It's his ongoing
sensory-deprivation experiment,

322
00:15:54,315 --> 00:15:56,013
sharpening one sense
by denying others.

323
00:15:56,014 --> 00:15:58,647
In this case, he can't hear, which
only amplifies his sense of smell.

324
00:15:58,648 --> 00:15:59,747
What?
Amazing!

325
00:15:59,748 --> 00:16:01,315
That's one word for it.

326
00:16:01,316 --> 00:16:02,519
I need complete
and utter silence.

327
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,085
What do you need silence for,
Shawn, if you can't hear anything?

328
00:16:05,086 --> 00:16:06,653
Shh! Please! Henry,
let the boy work.

329
00:16:06,654 --> 00:16:08,859
I smell chips!

330
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:11,598
Potato, po-tah-to!

331
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,034
Let's call
the whole thing off!

332
00:16:14,035 --> 00:16:16,869
Mr. Peterson,
I want you to grab my arm.

333
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,410
Both hands,
like you're doing a pull-up.

334
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:21,070
Feel the burn.

335
00:16:21,071 --> 00:16:23,410
I will now become a conduit
to your son's thoughts.

336
00:16:23,411 --> 00:16:26,213
Please, clear your mind
and your nasal passages.

337
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,418
Think of nothing but Brandon
and those chips.

338
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:30,854
Gus, present spuds!

339
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,456
I'm getting something.

340
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:39,091
It's not clear.

341
00:16:39,092 --> 00:16:40,290
That's a shocker.

342
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,892
Oh, ah, I'm wrong!
It's not potato!

343
00:16:43,893 --> 00:16:46,131
Gus, lose the spuds!

344
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:49,970
Chips! Ponch! John!

345
00:16:49,971 --> 00:16:52,805
Striker! Cracker! Poker!

346
00:16:52,806 --> 00:16:54,971
Poker? I hardly know her!

347
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,639
Shawn.
Poker chips!

348
00:16:56,883 --> 00:17:00,079
Well, what the hell do
poker chips smell like, Shawn?

349
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,052
They smell
like butterflies.

350
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,846
Poker chips...

351
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,186
And playing cards.

352
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,352
Ah!
What?

353
00:17:09,353 --> 00:17:11,156
What about the poker chips
and the playing cards?

354
00:17:11,157 --> 00:17:13,130
Ah! Gus, it burns!

355
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,528
The link has been broken.

356
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,463
I'll have to read the cards,

357
00:17:22,464 --> 00:17:24,066
see what they say.

358
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,541
Shawn!

359
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:33,850
There's your son.

360
00:17:33,851 --> 00:17:36,353
Notice there are no diamonds
around him.

361
00:17:36,354 --> 00:17:38,422
Well,
diamonds represent wealth.

362
00:17:38,423 --> 00:17:40,013
So Brandon lost his wealth
playing poker?

363
00:17:40,014 --> 00:17:41,115
That's correct, Gus.

364
00:17:41,116 --> 00:17:44,025
Yeah, well, what do all these
clubs around him mean, Shawn?

365
00:17:44,026 --> 00:17:46,291
Clubs, clubs are like

366
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,124
clover.

367
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:51,131
He's been playing poker
in a garden.

368
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,328
With this guy.

369
00:17:55,329 --> 00:17:56,875
We need a name.

370
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,836
Has he mentioned any of the
guys he plays poker with?

371
00:17:59,837 --> 00:18:01,173
DumbLuck2.

372
00:18:01,174 --> 00:18:03,339
That was his online
screen name.

373
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,144
I kept seeing it
on his computer

374
00:18:05,145 --> 00:18:06,843
when he was supposed
to be working.

375
00:18:06,844 --> 00:18:08,250
DumbLuck2.

376
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,919
Here, you can have Brandon.

377
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,016
Thanks.

378
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,224
<i>Hello?
Hi, Mrs. Lassiter?</i>

379
00:18:17,225 --> 00:18:19,024
<i>Yes? Who is this?
What do you want?</i>

380
00:18:19,025 --> 00:18:20,155
It's about your son.

381
00:18:20,156 --> 00:18:22,324
<i>Oh, no! It's the phone call!</i>

382
00:18:22,325 --> 00:18:25,199
Oh, no! No, no, no, no!
It's not... It's not that.

383
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:27,461
Well, then,
who the hell are you?

384
00:18:27,462 --> 00:18:28,528
I'm his partner.

385
00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:30,667
But you're a woman.

386
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,141
Yes. Shocking, isn't it?

387
00:18:34,142 --> 00:18:36,440
<i>What are you,
fulfilling a quota?</i>

388
00:18:36,441 --> 00:18:39,106
<i>If you get him shot...
I'm not getting him shot!</i>

389
00:18:39,107 --> 00:18:41,152
I just need to ask
a few personal questions.

390
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,413
<i>Personal questions?</i>

391
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:43,614
<i>You're not a cop.</i>

392
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:46,118
This is some kind of
Internet scam, isn't it?

393
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:48,751
<i>You'll want my Social Security
number next, right?</i>

394
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,954
Well, suck lemons, Cookiepuss!

395
00:18:50,955 --> 00:18:52,394
You're gettin' nothin'
out of me!

396
00:18:52,395 --> 00:18:53,863
<i>No. No, no, no. It's just...</i>

397
00:18:53,864 --> 00:18:56,594
It's his birthday.
It's coming up and I...

398
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:57,657
Who told you that?

399
00:18:57,658 --> 00:18:58,794
Excuse me?

400
00:18:58,795 --> 00:19:00,701
Booker doesn't celebrate
his birthdays.

401
00:19:00,702 --> 00:19:02,671
Booker?

402
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:06,501
Damn it!
Oh, you're good, Trickypants.

403
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:08,845
Well, I just want you to know

404
00:19:08,846 --> 00:19:10,778
this phone call is now
being recorded.

405
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:15,047
Um, I just need to get some inside
information because I wanna surprise him.

406
00:19:15,048 --> 00:19:17,611
<i>Why are you asking me?
Why don't you ask his wife?</i>

407
00:19:17,612 --> 00:19:20,487
Well, I didn't exactly think
that was appropriate

408
00:19:20,488 --> 00:19:21,957
with them being separated
and all.

409
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,120
They're what?

410
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:24,585
Nothing.

411
00:19:24,586 --> 00:19:26,790
<i>My son is separated?
No...</i>

412
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,061
I mean, I don't know.

413
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:32,131
Uh, please don't tell him
that you know.

414
00:19:32,132 --> 00:19:34,194
Please don't tell him
that I told you. I really...

415
00:19:34,195 --> 00:19:35,637
I had no idea.
Can we please just pretend

416
00:19:35,638 --> 00:19:37,140
this conversation
never happened?

417
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:39,006
Hello?

418
00:19:42,972 --> 00:19:44,072
Lassiter.

419
00:19:44,073 --> 00:19:45,378
Mother?

420
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:47,244
What?

421
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,853
What do you mean you want
your wedding ring back?

422
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:56,852
What are you doing?

423
00:19:56,853 --> 00:19:58,690
I'm playing online poker,
Shawn.

424
00:19:58,691 --> 00:20:01,129
I know I knew that name,
DumbLuck2.

425
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,793
I've played Brandon before,
right here, and I beat him.

426
00:20:03,794 --> 00:20:06,167
I figured I'd hang out,
see if he logs on.

427
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,043
Hmm.
Looks like a full house, huh?

428
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:14,541
How did you know that?

429
00:20:14,542 --> 00:20:16,012
You went...

430
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,916
I don't do that, Shawn.

431
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,313
I didn't do that!

432
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:29,721
Two pair.

433
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,331
I'd call. And raise.

434
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,527
You're sitting
on pocket rockets.

435
00:20:35,528 --> 00:20:36,760
You're not gonna do
any better than that.

436
00:20:36,761 --> 00:20:37,961
Seriously,
how do you do that?

437
00:20:37,962 --> 00:20:39,697
It's a good thing you're not
a real poker player, Gus.

438
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:41,170
You'd lose more money
than Brandon.

439
00:20:41,171 --> 00:20:43,264
I'm a stellar player, Shawn.
And don't think...

440
00:20:43,265 --> 00:20:44,707
Wait a second.
What?

441
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,604
He's on now! Brandon.

442
00:20:46,605 --> 00:20:48,544
Great! Bring him in.

443
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,775
Bring him in how?

444
00:20:52,776 --> 00:20:54,682
Say, "Hey, Brandon,
your dad's looking for you"?

445
00:20:54,683 --> 00:20:57,313
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait
a second here, time out.

446
00:20:57,314 --> 00:20:58,378
What?

447
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,250
You're "BigKitty75"?

448
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:04,753
Yeah, as in the kitty,
you know, the pot.

449
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:07,157
The kitty?
Yes, 75.

450
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,764
<i>74 other "Big Kitties"
came before you?</i>

451
00:21:10,765 --> 00:21:13,498
<i>Yeah, Shawn, there were 74
of 'em. All right. All right.</i>

452
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:16,004
Does Kitty have a profile?

453
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,834
It's Big Kitty,
and no, I don't!

454
00:21:17,835 --> 00:21:20,776
Perfect. Scoot over. Give
me some room to operate here.

455
00:21:20,777 --> 00:21:23,245
What are you doing?
Baiting the hook, Gus.

456
00:21:23,246 --> 00:21:24,873
Baiting the hook? How?

457
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,743
You can't do this, Shawn!
This is my account! Shh, relax.

458
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,446
Don't you tell me to...
You don't have a profile.

459
00:21:29,447 --> 00:21:31,113
They don't know if "Big Kitty"
is a man or... I'm a man!

460
00:21:31,114 --> 00:21:33,919
The players I play poker with, chat
with, know that I'm a man, Shawn!

461
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,289
That's funny,

462
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,293
'cause it appears Brandon
thinks that you're a...

463
00:21:37,294 --> 00:21:38,762
A cheerleader?

464
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,696
"Where does a girl go around
here for fun and games?"

465
00:21:41,697 --> 00:21:43,598
Stop it, Shawn! Get the...

466
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,360
Relax! I can't
transfer my bank!

467
00:21:45,361 --> 00:21:47,028
I have 7 million
bucks! Oh!

468
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:48,663
Oh, what's my name?

469
00:21:48,664 --> 00:21:49,934
Oh, I don't know.
Shawn...

470
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:51,635
BigKitty75.
Shawn...

471
00:21:51,636 --> 00:21:54,735
You know, Kitty? The
Kitty... Kitty-Cat? Feline!

472
00:21:54,736 --> 00:21:56,781
Ah! Felicia.

473
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:58,679
"Felicia Fancybottom"?

474
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,047
What am I,
a James Bond villain?

475
00:22:00,048 --> 00:22:01,881
Look, he's inviting us
into a private chat.

476
00:22:01,882 --> 00:22:04,548
Don't do it, Shawn. I'm
telling you, don't do it!

477
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,781
Buy me a drink?

478
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,886
I think that question's
for you, Felicia.

479
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,092
Where?

480
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:14,191
I don't know.
I... I can't...

481
00:22:14,192 --> 00:22:17,029
Dude, where do you go to hook
up with dudes you meet online?

482
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,764
That's not funny, Shawn.

483
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,870
Coffee with
Attitude Coffeehouse?

484
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,574
Bring a flower?

485
00:22:25,575 --> 00:22:28,010
What do you think?
Poinsettia?

486
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:30,371
That's a plant, not a flower.

487
00:22:30,372 --> 00:22:32,383
And it's out of season.
Perfect.

488
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:35,550
We'll see just how badly
he wants to impress

489
00:22:35,551 --> 00:22:39,079
Big Felicia Fancybottom.

490
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,363
Ah! He's punctual.

491
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,134
I like that in a date.

492
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:56,239
Whoa, guys, I'm expecting
somebody, actually.

493
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,774
We know.
Felicia.

494
00:22:57,775 --> 00:22:59,504
Yeah, how do you know...

495
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:04,541
Huh. She's not comin', is she?

496
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:06,315
He's Felicia.

497
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:08,680
And I'm Felicia.

498
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:10,946
Great! Yeah, I knew it.

499
00:23:10,947 --> 00:23:12,957
All hot internet women
are guys!

500
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,387
Of course, you're two guys,
which makes it doubly weird.

501
00:23:16,388 --> 00:23:18,258
Sorry, Brandon, but your
Dad's lookin' for you.

502
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:20,525
That's the rub.
He hired us.

503
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:24,324
Oh, yeah? Well, the joke's
on you 'cause I'm outta here.

504
00:23:24,325 --> 00:23:25,835
Hey, we just wanna talk.

505
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:30,936
What's goin' on?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

506
00:23:30,937 --> 00:23:32,306
You, uh,
you know these guys?

507
00:23:32,307 --> 00:23:35,141
Hey, relax.
Brandon and I are friends.

508
00:23:35,142 --> 00:23:37,044
I just wanna talk to him
for a minute.

509
00:23:37,045 --> 00:23:39,175
- So how's it goin', you good?
- Yeah.

510
00:23:40,342 --> 00:23:41,613
Hey!
Whoa!

511
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:45,555
It's just so you don't
forget. You have until Monday.

512
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:51,722
Oh!

513
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,391
You were saying?

514
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:59,063
Well, it looks like your dad's not the
only one who's lookin' for ya, huh?

515
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:06,141
All right, look. You guys
gotta give me a break, okay?

516
00:24:06,142 --> 00:24:08,235
I stole $30,000 dollars
from my dad

517
00:24:08,236 --> 00:24:12,080
and then I lost it, and more,
to that jerk, J.P. Berger.

518
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:15,511
So I can't go home, not until I
win enough to pay everybody back.

519
00:24:15,512 --> 00:24:17,417
What'd he say,
you've got till Monday?

520
00:24:17,418 --> 00:24:19,956
Yeah, he did,
but see, the thing is,

521
00:24:19,957 --> 00:24:23,118
I'm a better player
than he is. I am much better.

522
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:25,162
And yet he bent you
over his knee

523
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:27,356
and spanked you in front
of the whole class.

524
00:24:27,357 --> 00:24:29,093
But he shouldn't have!

525
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:32,467
I just... I just gotta
figure out how he did it.

526
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,404
Look, Brandon, it's simple.

527
00:24:34,405 --> 00:24:36,838
You go to your dad and convince
him to give you your job back.

528
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:39,433
And then you figure out a way to
pay this Berger back his money.

529
00:24:39,434 --> 00:24:41,375
Yeah,
that sounds really great.

530
00:24:41,376 --> 00:24:43,573
But, guys, I can't go
back to work for my dad.

531
00:24:43,574 --> 00:24:46,674
Nothing I do is ever good enough
for that man, nothing is right.

532
00:24:46,675 --> 00:24:48,480
You have no idea
what that's like.

533
00:24:48,481 --> 00:24:51,919
Look,
here's some brutal truth.

534
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,584
We're the only reasons
you're not in jail, or worse.

535
00:24:54,585 --> 00:24:55,751
Your dad's done.

536
00:24:55,752 --> 00:24:59,627
It took someone cashing in a very
old favor to get us involved at all.

537
00:24:59,628 --> 00:25:03,428
Now, you are not gonna be able to play
your way out of this hole, baby boy!

538
00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:07,164
So pack it in!
Pull the plug! Shut it down!

539
00:25:07,165 --> 00:25:09,706
Leave the dead meat in the freezer
and put on your Sunday best,

540
00:25:09,707 --> 00:25:11,504
'cause it's Arbor Day, baby!

541
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:13,972
Okay. Fair enough.

542
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,114
Let's get this over with.

543
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,947
Take me to my father.

544
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:23,054
What'd I tell ya?

545
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:28,685
Morning till night, the old
man never stops selling.

546
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:30,685
Want some advice?

547
00:25:30,686 --> 00:25:31,786
Yeah, sure.

548
00:25:31,787 --> 00:25:33,592
When you owe a man
$30,000 dollars,

549
00:25:33,593 --> 00:25:36,224
I'd be careful about
criticizing his work ethic.

550
00:25:36,225 --> 00:25:37,791
That's a good point.

551
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:39,160
You want us
to come with you?

552
00:25:39,161 --> 00:25:41,138
No. No, you know what?

553
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:44,667
I screwed up on my own, I
am gonna face him on my own.

554
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:46,775
That's very
Cameron Frye of you.

555
00:25:46,776 --> 00:25:48,403
It's Cameron who?

556
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:51,279
Wow, are we that much
older than you?

557
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:53,243
What's that?

558
00:25:53,244 --> 00:25:55,308
That's nothin'.
It's a good luck charm.

559
00:25:55,309 --> 00:25:57,947
I mean, used to be.
But you know what?

560
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,423
Here. I don't need it.

561
00:26:00,424 --> 00:26:02,049
I've given up cards,
I got no use for it.

562
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:04,754
Whoa! No, thanks.
Not really a jewelry guy.

563
00:26:04,755 --> 00:26:06,126
Gus here is.
No, I'm not.

564
00:26:06,127 --> 00:26:07,256
Sure you are.

565
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,594
Right.

566
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,662
Phew! Let's get this
over with, right?

567
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,598
You tryin' to pass
that thing off to me?

568
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:16,504
You liked it.
You like the sweet turquoise.

569
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:30,018
So you're telling me that you've
been working with him for 15 years,

570
00:26:30,019 --> 00:26:31,851
but you have no idea
what kind of food he likes?

571
00:26:31,852 --> 00:26:33,948
He orders separate
when we get take-out.

572
00:26:33,949 --> 00:26:35,823
Something about poison.

573
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:27,508
What are you doing?

574
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,007
Looking.

575
00:27:30,008 --> 00:27:31,207
For what?

576
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:32,706
A mint.

577
00:27:32,707 --> 00:27:34,842
I'm allergic to mint.
Ah-ha!

578
00:27:34,843 --> 00:27:35,943
What?

579
00:27:35,944 --> 00:27:37,249
Nothing.

580
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:38,855
I'm just happy.

581
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,052
Now I know
you don't like mint.

582
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:48,894
Well, well.

583
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,526
Don't you look like hell.

584
00:27:52,527 --> 00:27:54,002
I know I look
like hell, Dad.

585
00:27:54,003 --> 00:27:56,232
Everyone who gets up at
this hour looks like hell.

586
00:27:56,233 --> 00:27:58,366
With the possible exception
of Matt Lauer and Diane Lane.

587
00:27:58,367 --> 00:28:00,637
Mr. Peterson, how are
you, sir? Something wrong?

588
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:01,735
No, no, Shawn,
everything is great.

589
00:28:01,736 --> 00:28:05,612
That's why I woke your ass up, had you
zip down here so Bill and I could tell you

590
00:28:05,613 --> 00:28:07,378
how terrific everything is.

591
00:28:07,379 --> 00:28:09,215
It's Brandon.
Brandon?

592
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:12,646
Well, he seemed fine when we dropped him
off yesterday, maybe a little nervous.

593
00:28:12,647 --> 00:28:14,657
Wait, wait, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. You found him?

594
00:28:14,658 --> 00:28:15,817
Well, yeah, we did.

595
00:28:15,818 --> 00:28:17,919
When was this?
Yesterday.

596
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:21,931
I'm sorry, sir,
I should have told you.

597
00:28:21,932 --> 00:28:25,457
It was right before closing. We
could clearly see you from Gus' car,

598
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:27,902
and he said he wanted
to come in by himself,

599
00:28:27,903 --> 00:28:30,669
do this man-to-man,
you know, just you and him.

600
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,402
He didn't come in?
You never saw him?

601
00:28:33,403 --> 00:28:35,069
Oh, we saw him, all right.

602
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,741
I got the reunion right here.
You wanna see it?

603
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:41,744
There he is,
there's my boy.

604
00:28:41,745 --> 00:28:44,549
Guess he couldn't face me, so he
waited until after I went home.

605
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:47,056
Not the safe? He's
breaking into your safe?

606
00:28:47,057 --> 00:28:49,490
Breaking in? No,
he didn't have to break in.

607
00:28:49,491 --> 00:28:51,084
He's too smart for that.

608
00:28:51,085 --> 00:28:52,653
He knows the combination!

609
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:02,331
There you have it. Not quite
the reunion I imagined.

610
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:06,775
So tell me, psychic,

611
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,008
where's my son now?

612
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,781
Something's
bothering me, dude.

613
00:29:19,782 --> 00:29:21,085
I'm never wrong!

614
00:29:21,086 --> 00:29:22,682
You're always wrong,
what are you talkin' about?

615
00:29:22,683 --> 00:29:24,387
That this kid should be
a better poker player, Gus.

616
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:26,123
That was a pretty good bluff.

617
00:29:26,124 --> 00:29:27,665
Oh, dude, look!

618
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:31,332
What? Right there.
That necklace thing.

619
00:29:32,404 --> 00:29:33,495
That's horrible.

620
00:29:33,496 --> 00:29:36,597
He wears his ridiculous
good luck charm into battle

621
00:29:36,598 --> 00:29:38,232
the way that Superman
wears his cape,

622
00:29:38,233 --> 00:29:40,243
or Rocky Balboa
wears his belt.

623
00:29:40,244 --> 00:29:44,077
I bet you he's on his way back
to the maze to take on Berger.

624
00:29:44,078 --> 00:29:46,776
No, Berger's not gonna be at the lawn
and garden center. Not this weekend.

625
00:29:46,777 --> 00:29:47,840
Why not?

626
00:29:47,841 --> 00:29:51,183
There's a tournament goin' on where the
winner gets a buy-in to the World Poker Derby.

627
00:29:51,184 --> 00:29:52,244
You know where that is?

628
00:29:52,245 --> 00:29:53,586
Of course I do!
Phew!

629
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:58,287
Ooh! Phew! Ah!
Oh, it's flipping!

630
00:29:58,288 --> 00:30:00,888
Ah, it wants to flip! Oh,
it wants to flop! Dad!

631
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,604
T.P.

632
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:15,171
Toilet paper... No.

633
00:30:15,172 --> 00:30:16,780
Teri Polo.
Shawn...

634
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:18,645
T.P. Tee-pee.

635
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:20,618
Tee-pee with a chimmy...

636
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:25,778
Chimmy, chimmy-changa, chimi-changa,
Chaka Khan. Chaka Khan. Chaka Khan.

637
00:30:25,779 --> 00:30:27,414
Chimi-changa.
Cha-changa?

638
00:30:27,415 --> 00:30:29,550
Cha-changa!
That's it.

639
00:30:29,551 --> 00:30:32,788
You say tomato,
I say to-mah-to.

640
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,092
Cha-changa.

641
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:35,831
The Indian casino?

642
00:30:35,832 --> 00:30:37,367
Cha-ching!

643
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:39,631
Damn it!
You were right, Henry.

644
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:40,993
How's that?

645
00:30:40,994 --> 00:30:45,032
Maybe getting the police involved
is the only way to get his attention.

646
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,406
May I have that DVD, please?

647
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,738
No.

648
00:30:52,739 --> 00:30:54,545
Excuse me?
Shawn!

649
00:30:54,546 --> 00:30:55,677
Not yet.

650
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:56,876
Why?

651
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,316
Let's give him another chance.

652
00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:02,658
I'm sensing there's
more to this story, sir.

653
00:31:02,659 --> 00:31:04,923
He's actually
a pretty good poker player.

654
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:10,626
I'm getting a very, very
strong psychic vibration

655
00:31:10,627 --> 00:31:12,169
he's gonna lose

656
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,238
big!

657
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,976
Not with my money
he's not.

658
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:28,676
Let's go.
Oh, God.

659
00:31:28,677 --> 00:31:30,152
We're outta here.
No, Dad. Dad, I can't.

660
00:31:30,153 --> 00:31:31,279
Would you rather
I call the police

661
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,346
and show them a certain video
of you looting my safe?

662
00:31:33,347 --> 00:31:35,119
I know,
I'm sorry about all that.

663
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,386
No, Brandon. Let's go.

664
00:31:36,387 --> 00:31:39,157
No, Dad, Dad, I'm in more
trouble here than you think.

665
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:44,496
I'm already in! And they
don't give refunds here.

666
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:47,766
Fine.

667
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,837
I'll play. Whoa,
whoa, whoa. You?

668
00:31:50,838 --> 00:31:52,466
You know what? Actually,
sir, this is your call.

669
00:31:52,467 --> 00:31:54,773
I work for you. But keep
in mind that I am a psychic

670
00:31:54,774 --> 00:31:56,710
and, unlike any of these
other players,

671
00:31:56,711 --> 00:31:59,148
I come with
a money-back guarantee.

672
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,714
What do you think, Henry?
Can he win?

673
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:05,146
<i>Dad, I don't gamble. I win.</i>

674
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:08,753
Yeah. He can win.

675
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,964
So, what's the deal?

676
00:32:16,965 --> 00:32:18,524
Shawn and Berger
drew opposite tables.

677
00:32:18,525 --> 00:32:21,093
The only way for him face Berger is
if he beats everyone at his table,

678
00:32:21,094 --> 00:32:23,107
makes it to the finals,
and wins.

679
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:30,307
Check.

680
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,462
God, must be rough.

681
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,490
Sorry?

682
00:32:49,491 --> 00:32:51,660
You picked the wrong week
to quit smoking, dude.

683
00:32:51,661 --> 00:32:53,431
There's a tournament
happening here.

684
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,370
What are you talking about?

685
00:32:55,371 --> 00:32:57,430
What is this about? Is this
about your lady friend, huh?

686
00:32:57,431 --> 00:33:00,272
Your special girl back home?
She doesn't like it?

687
00:33:00,273 --> 00:33:03,608
Look at the cards, guys, huh? Lot of
possibilities on the table right now.

688
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:05,445
Lot of possibilities.

689
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:08,711
Fifty thousand.

690
00:33:08,712 --> 00:33:12,450
Midnight oil says no! No!

691
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,748
Call.

692
00:33:13,749 --> 00:33:16,224
Ay-ay-ay, action.

693
00:33:16,225 --> 00:33:20,060
Action in my fanny pack.
All right, I'll call you both.

694
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:26,594
You didn't catch
your straight, did you?

695
00:33:26,595 --> 00:33:28,161
Hundred thousand.

696
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:31,898
Fold.

697
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,975
You let me down.
You let me down.

698
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:35,539
Ronnie!

699
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,637
What?

700
00:33:36,638 --> 00:33:38,682
This can be your time,
right here, right now.

701
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,011
You think you can mess
with my head, too?

702
00:33:40,012 --> 00:33:41,278
Here's the thing,
I'm a psychic.

703
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,786
So if I had to guess,
which I don't, I'd say yes.

704
00:33:43,787 --> 00:33:47,551
Yes, I can mess with your head and I
can put an entire sandwich in your hair.

705
00:33:47,552 --> 00:33:49,616
Well, you know what? I'm
not playing with a psychic.

706
00:33:49,617 --> 00:33:51,024
It's against the rules.

707
00:33:51,025 --> 00:33:53,859
Against the rules? No, guys,
guys, I checked the rulebook.

708
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,489
I looked in the index
under "P".

709
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:58,592
It mentioned polygamy,
pancakes, and pterodactyls.

710
00:33:58,593 --> 00:34:00,603
Who knew pterodactyl started
with a "P"?

711
00:34:00,604 --> 00:34:02,434
I bet you did. You did.

712
00:34:02,435 --> 00:34:04,667
It's not against the rules,
Ronnie. It's cool.

713
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:06,505
No, it's not cool.

714
00:34:06,506 --> 00:34:07,976
Look at your stack, man.

715
00:34:07,977 --> 00:34:09,740
Everything's here.
Everything's here.

716
00:34:09,741 --> 00:34:12,544
I need you here. Take a
risk, man! Bluff it up!

717
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:15,477
I'll raise you
two hundred thousand.

718
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:18,414
You just bluffed to prove
to me that you could bluff.

719
00:34:18,415 --> 00:34:20,617
Ronnie...

720
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:24,419
I call this move
the all in.

721
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,803
Ronnie with the origami.

722
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:39,071
Oh! Oh!

723
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:00,289
<i>Center table showdown,</i>

724
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:02,765
<i>Shawn Spencer
and J.P. Berger.</i>

725
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:31,522
All in.

726
00:35:32,197 --> 00:35:33,425
All in?

727
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:35,626
All in?

728
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:51,241
<i>Yeah, but he shouldn't have. I
just gotta figure out how he did it.</i>

729
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:05,455
Wait!

730
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:08,323
Wait, wait, wait.

731
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,131
The chips demand
we stop the game.

732
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:12,927
What the hell
is going on here?

733
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:16,098
Shh! I can't hear them
if you're talking, Berger.

734
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:17,568
What?

735
00:36:18,076 --> 00:36:19,065
Really?

736
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:21,742
You guys sure about this?

737
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:27,115
Chips say you're a
cheater-cheater pumpkin-eater!

738
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,809
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

739
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,651
And how do they know that?

740
00:36:32,652 --> 00:36:35,214
We're really supposed to believe
that you're psychic or something!

741
00:36:35,215 --> 00:36:38,989
If you were psychic, I wouldn't
be cleaning your clock right now.

742
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:42,362
Cleaning my clock?
What does that mean, Berger?

743
00:36:42,363 --> 00:36:45,061
What, you'd take time out of your
day to clean another man's timepiece?

744
00:36:45,062 --> 00:36:46,932
And if so,
that would be a bad thing?

745
00:36:46,933 --> 00:36:49,438
No, I would be gracious.
I would say, "J.P., dude,

746
00:36:49,439 --> 00:36:51,441
"thanks for
spritzing my watch."

747
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:53,199
Besides, it doesn't matter.

748
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,713
Doesn't take a psychic to figure
out that these cards are marked.

749
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:59,180
You know what, if you had
been paying attention,

750
00:36:59,181 --> 00:37:01,376
you'd realize that
the decks were all sealed.

751
00:37:01,377 --> 00:37:04,513
Shh! He's saying the decks are
sealed. What do you got for me?

752
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,321
Well, come on, guys,
speed it up!

753
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,420
Check the...

754
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:11,718
Oh!

755
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,296
For shame!

756
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:17,827
You dirty filthy rascal
with the suede-suede head.

757
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:20,795
Ah-ha!

758
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:26,038
Face card.
Face card.

759
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,843
Well, how's that possible?
These are brand-new decks.

760
00:37:30,844 --> 00:37:31,938
We got spotters
on every table.

761
00:37:31,939 --> 00:37:34,711
But you didn't check
your dealers!

762
00:37:34,712 --> 00:37:36,810
Okay, I'm on the dealer.
What do you got for me?

763
00:37:36,811 --> 00:37:39,150
Hair clip? Hair clip!
Of course.

764
00:37:39,151 --> 00:37:41,157
You! You stand up!

765
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:42,590
I'm sorry, ah...
Wait, let me...

766
00:37:42,591 --> 00:37:44,161
Hold on! This...

767
00:37:46,164 --> 00:37:49,496
Oh, my, there's some kind of
invisible ink on this hair clip,

768
00:37:49,497 --> 00:37:51,932
and every time she fussed
with her ponytail,

769
00:37:51,933 --> 00:37:54,300
and I think we can all agree it's
a fetching tail, it's a silky tail,

770
00:37:54,301 --> 00:37:58,330
she got the ink on her fingers and
then she put her fingers on the cards!

771
00:37:58,331 --> 00:38:01,571
And then her special partner with
his special rose-colored glasses

772
00:38:01,572 --> 00:38:04,773
could see that everything
is turning up faces.

773
00:38:04,774 --> 00:38:05,837
All right.
We're not partners.

774
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:07,474
Put a hold on all these chips
here. This is ridiculous!

775
00:38:07,475 --> 00:38:09,382
Take these two into custody
until we sort this out.

776
00:38:09,383 --> 00:38:10,784
This is ridiculous!
You're ridiculous!

777
00:38:10,785 --> 00:38:11,913
For shame!

778
00:38:16,194 --> 00:38:19,095
That is so much money.

779
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:25,032
I'll, uh, I'll let you
guys make it right.

780
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:30,298
Well, now I know why I
always lost to Berger. It wasn't me.

781
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:32,600
But, um,

782
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:36,737
it was me stealin' from you
and lying to you,

783
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,913
and, Dad, for that,
I really am sorry.

784
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:42,712
Well,
I appreciate the apology, Son.

785
00:38:42,713 --> 00:38:46,313
But you're gonna have to do a lot
more than that to earn my trust back.

786
00:38:46,314 --> 00:38:47,482
Thank you.

787
00:38:47,483 --> 00:38:49,526
No, thank, thank you,
Mr. Peterson!

788
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:52,562
- No, thank you.
- No, seriously, thank you.

789
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:53,961
Shut up!
Okay.

790
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,125
Dude! $7,500?

791
00:38:57,126 --> 00:39:00,432
Peterson is a generous man. This
is our most profitable case ever!

792
00:39:00,433 --> 00:39:01,664
I know, I got plans!

793
00:39:01,665 --> 00:39:03,706
Pay off the flat screen,
consolidate our loans,

794
00:39:03,707 --> 00:39:04,934
and pay off the bulk
in a lump sum!

795
00:39:04,935 --> 00:39:06,032
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ooh!

796
00:39:06,033 --> 00:39:07,099
Or...
What...

797
00:39:07,612 --> 00:39:09,545
We double up, right
here, right now. What?

798
00:39:09,546 --> 00:39:11,808
Come on, Gus, think about it,
seriously, fifteen large?

799
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:13,042
What are you talkin' about,
Shawn?

800
00:39:13,043 --> 00:39:14,140
We could go to Aruba.
Shawn...

801
00:39:14,141 --> 00:39:15,242
Cozumel.
Shawn!

802
00:39:15,243 --> 00:39:16,445
Ibeeza.
It's Ibiza!

803
00:39:16,446 --> 00:39:18,283
Dude, we could rent
a jet to Ibiza.

804
00:39:18,284 --> 00:39:19,379
Don't even think about it!

805
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,583
Rule number one of gambling,
do not think.

806
00:39:21,584 --> 00:39:22,682
That's not a rule, Shawn!

807
00:39:22,683 --> 00:39:24,158
Rule number two,

808
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:26,026
always bet on black.

809
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:29,893
Money plays.
Whoa, but...

810
00:39:29,894 --> 00:39:31,367
Isn't that right, Steve?

811
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,733
I can't believe
you did that!

812
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:48,549
Look, I told you
that's why I don't gamble, Gus.

813
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,643
Shut up, Shawn!

814
00:39:49,644 --> 00:39:51,950
<i>What did Wesley say in Passenger
57? I don't want to talk about it!</i>

815
00:39:51,951 --> 00:39:53,957
He said, "Always bet
on black." So I did!

816
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:56,991
Yeah. Here you go.
They're cold.

817
00:39:57,862 --> 00:40:01,353
Um, Lassiter leads a really
different private life.

818
00:40:01,354 --> 00:40:03,661
Yeah... I mean, who'd have
thought he was into bikes?

819
00:40:03,662 --> 00:40:04,792
I guess.

820
00:40:04,793 --> 00:40:05,892
Hi.

821
00:40:05,893 --> 00:40:08,631
Well, some of these people
look really familiar.

822
00:40:08,632 --> 00:40:11,799
Yeah! I know, to me, too! But I haven't
had a chance to talk to any of them yet.

823
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,864
I see his car!
I see his car!

824
00:40:12,865 --> 00:40:15,310
What? Oh! Everybody hide!
Hide!

825
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:36,490
What the hell?

826
00:40:48,046 --> 00:40:49,741
Surprise!

827
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:53,273
Whoa! Whoa!
No, it's okay.

828
00:40:53,274 --> 00:40:54,476
Whoa! Move it!

829
00:40:54,477 --> 00:40:56,849
Oh! Oh, my gosh, no,
no, no! No, no, no, Carlton!

830
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,945
Hey! It's a party,
it's a party!

831
00:40:58,946 --> 00:41:00,046
It's what?

832
00:41:00,047 --> 00:41:03,093
For your birthday! Surprise!

833
00:41:04,262 --> 00:41:06,457
Why are these people
at my house?

834
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:07,857
They're your friends.

835
00:41:07,858 --> 00:41:08,989
No, they're not.

836
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:11,763
Yeah, they are! I got 'em
out of your address book.

837
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:13,330
You took my book?

838
00:41:13,331 --> 00:41:16,133
Yes, I admit it,
I opened your desk.

839
00:41:16,134 --> 00:41:18,367
I didn't want to load you up
with a bunch of work people,

840
00:41:18,368 --> 00:41:20,273
so I just invited the ones
with stars by their names.

841
00:41:20,274 --> 00:41:22,244
These are all people
I put in jail.

842
00:41:22,245 --> 00:41:24,076
The stars are
repeat offenders.

843
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:28,412
You keep a little black book
of people you've arrested?

844
00:41:28,413 --> 00:41:29,746
Of course I do.

845
00:41:29,747 --> 00:41:30,810
Why?

846
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:33,584
To drive by and check on them.

847
00:41:40,565 --> 00:41:43,465
Um, um, oh, Carlton,
where are you going?

848
00:41:43,466 --> 00:41:45,023
To pack!
Why?

849
00:41:45,024 --> 00:41:47,569
Because now they know
where I live!

850
00:41:49,407 --> 00:41:50,498
Happy Birthday, dude!

851
00:41:50,499 --> 00:41:51,906
Happy Birthday!

852
00:41:52,944 --> 00:41:54,536
Nice house!

853
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:16,188
