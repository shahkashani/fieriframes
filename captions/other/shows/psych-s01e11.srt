1
00:00:13,579 --> 00:00:15,274
Shawn! Stop.

2
00:00:17,082 --> 00:00:18,208
Turn around.

3
00:00:19,151 --> 00:00:20,276
Turn around.

4
00:00:20,277 --> 00:00:21,819
What are you hiding?

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,550
Did you get in a
fight, Shawn? Kind of.

6
00:00:30,551 --> 00:00:31,720
Kind of?
What do you mean, kind of?

7
00:00:31,721 --> 00:00:34,197
What did I tell you about
fighting? Get over here, son.

8
00:00:35,134 --> 00:00:36,567
Take a look at that.

9
00:00:40,272 --> 00:00:43,469
You really got punched.
Here, hold that on your eye.

10
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,205
All right, tell me, what's the
name of this kid who hit you?

11
00:00:47,206 --> 00:00:48,405
Elizabeth.

12
00:00:49,581 --> 00:00:50,911
You got in a fight
with a girl?

13
00:00:50,912 --> 00:00:52,176
Well,
it wasn't really a fight.

14
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,274
She just punched me.

15
00:00:53,275 --> 00:00:54,909
Why in the world
would she punch you?

16
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,351
What happened?

17
00:00:56,352 --> 00:00:58,946
She asked me to sit next
to her at lunch and I did.

18
00:00:59,691 --> 00:01:02,716
And then I was eating my Tater
Tots and she just punched me.

19
00:01:02,717 --> 00:01:04,954
Wait a second.
Wait a second.

20
00:01:05,197 --> 00:01:07,756
What was she doing while you
were eating your Tater Tots?

21
00:01:07,757 --> 00:01:10,027
I don't know. She was
talking about something.

22
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,398
What?
What was she talking about?

23
00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:14,494
I have no idea.
She just went on and on

24
00:01:14,495 --> 00:01:16,598
and I was concentrating
on my Tater Tots.

25
00:01:17,309 --> 00:01:18,434
I'll be damned.

26
00:01:18,435 --> 00:01:21,569
Shawn, I know what happened.
You just had your first date.

27
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,274
Sit. Sit.

28
00:01:24,683 --> 00:01:25,706
My first what?

29
00:01:25,707 --> 00:01:27,842
Look, obviously this
Elizabeth girl likes you.

30
00:01:27,843 --> 00:01:30,045
That's why she invited you
over to sit next to her.

31
00:01:30,046 --> 00:01:31,679
Then why'd she sock me
in the eye?

32
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,316
Because she likes you and you
didn't listen to her story.

33
00:01:34,317 --> 00:01:36,189
Women want you
to listen to them, Shawn.

34
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,989
They want you to pick up
every small detail,

35
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,427
they want you
to compliment them.

36
00:01:39,428 --> 00:01:40,987
It's about tuning in
to people.

37
00:01:40,988 --> 00:01:44,330
It's about getting inside their
heads and anticipating their needs.

38
00:01:44,331 --> 00:01:45,994
And this applies
to all aspects of life.

39
00:01:45,995 --> 00:01:49,130
Not only this girl Elizabeth,
but even your barber.

40
00:01:49,131 --> 00:01:50,834
But I don't want
to date the barber.

41
00:01:50,835 --> 00:01:52,500
Shawn,
I know that one day

42
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:54,374
all of this is going
to make sense to you.

43
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:55,913
You just have to believe me.

44
00:01:56,248 --> 00:01:59,740
For now, I'm going to leave
you with one very simple rule.

45
00:02:00,452 --> 00:02:02,181
Under no circumstances ever,

46
00:02:03,188 --> 00:02:07,750
ever do you mention to a
woman her age or her weight.

47
00:02:08,293 --> 00:02:09,520
Nobody breathe.
I've got it.

48
00:02:09,521 --> 00:02:11,619
I've got it in grams
and I've got it in minutes.

49
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,291
Just give me a second here.
Do a little converting.

50
00:02:18,971 --> 00:02:20,268
I got it.

51
00:02:21,206 --> 00:02:24,801
37 years old. 127 pounds.

52
00:02:27,613 --> 00:02:30,309
That was amazing.
How did you do that?

53
00:02:30,983 --> 00:02:34,509
I have to admit though, sadly, it's just a
teensy bit higher in the weight department.

54
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,143
Oh, you know what?
That's my bad.

55
00:02:36,144 --> 00:02:38,950
I believe I was getting a
future reading from next week.

56
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:40,684
It happens. I apologize.

57
00:02:40,685 --> 00:02:43,283
Wait. I'm also getting
a dance belt.

58
00:02:43,284 --> 00:02:46,728
You are my head detective.
And fishnet stockings.

59
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:49,096
But that's this guy.
That's this guy here.

60
00:02:50,302 --> 00:02:51,461
Shawn. Shawn.
I'm kidding.

61
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:52,866
You're such a good sport.
Everybody loves you.

62
00:02:52,867 --> 00:02:55,429
Hey, Spencer.
Lassy face.

63
00:02:58,443 --> 00:03:00,877
Got the perfect case
for you guys.

64
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:03,136
I'm sorry. You're saying
that you want our help?

65
00:03:03,137 --> 00:03:04,339
Yeah.
What's the catch?

66
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,110
There's no catch.
It's just right up your alley.

67
00:03:06,111 --> 00:03:08,174
We could really use
your insights on this one.

68
00:03:08,175 --> 00:03:10,448
The guy's waiting to give you a
statement. Interrogation room B.

69
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:13,423
Make me proud.

70
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:17,786
Okay. What does that
sound like to you?

71
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:20,158
An opportunity.

72
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:21,923
No.

73
00:03:21,924 --> 00:03:24,058
You think Lassiter's going
to just hand us over a case?

74
00:03:24,059 --> 00:03:25,762
Stop. Let's think
about this for a minute.

75
00:03:25,763 --> 00:03:27,201
Gus, come on.
What?

76
00:03:27,202 --> 00:03:29,967
We're going to roll up our sleeves,
we're going to get a little bit dirty

77
00:03:29,968 --> 00:03:32,134
and we're going to do some
old-fashioned police work.

78
00:03:32,135 --> 00:03:34,109
<i>Come on. This is like
In the Heat of the Night.</i>

79
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,873
Which makes me
Carroll O'Connor.

80
00:03:35,874 --> 00:03:37,436
No. That means
you're Rod Steiger.

81
00:03:37,437 --> 00:03:38,982
That way, I'm Sidney Poitier.

82
00:03:38,983 --> 00:03:40,177
You know that's right.

83
00:03:41,753 --> 00:03:43,050
Oh, boy.

84
00:03:44,323 --> 00:03:45,312
Wow.

85
00:03:45,991 --> 00:03:48,117
<i>Looks like somebody beat
us to the rolling of the sleeves.</i>

86
00:03:48,118 --> 00:03:49,318
No.
What are you doing?

87
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,588
What?

88
00:03:52,097 --> 00:03:53,893
This is our case.
He's naked.

89
00:03:53,894 --> 00:03:55,192
We got to work the room.

90
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,290
I'm gonna work it
from the outside.

91
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,268
You're gonna work it from
in here. Now shut the door.

92
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:07,069
Mr. Turk, is it?

93
00:04:07,779 --> 00:04:09,006
My name's Shawn Spencer.

94
00:04:09,007 --> 00:04:11,879
I'm the head P for the SBPD.

95
00:04:12,217 --> 00:04:13,615
You're the who for the what?

96
00:04:13,616 --> 00:04:16,414
Don't concern yourself with
the formalities, Mr. Turk.

97
00:04:16,415 --> 00:04:17,613
I'm here to take
your statement and find out

98
00:04:17,614 --> 00:04:19,246
just what exactly
happened to you.

99
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:20,654
Well,
I don't really remember much.

100
00:04:20,655 --> 00:04:21,750
Funny.

101
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:23,691
It says here you told
the desk sergeant,

102
00:04:23,692 --> 00:04:25,695
you woke up naked in a field
with your ass hanging out.

103
00:04:25,696 --> 00:04:27,058
Yeah, that's right.

104
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,929
But I don't remember
exactly what they look like.

105
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,025
You know, it's all really
confusing for me right now.

106
00:04:32,026 --> 00:04:35,266
When you say "they,"
just who are you referring to?

107
00:04:35,267 --> 00:04:37,205
The aliens.

108
00:04:39,711 --> 00:04:40,837
See?

109
00:04:47,219 --> 00:04:48,276
Right, aliens.

110
00:04:48,277 --> 00:04:50,445
Here it is.
Page two, got it.

111
00:04:50,446 --> 00:04:52,284
How would you describe
these aliens, Mr. Turk?

112
00:04:52,285 --> 00:04:54,881
Would you say they were small?
Would you say they were green?

113
00:04:54,882 --> 00:04:57,223
You know, I don't really
recall right now.

114
00:04:57,224 --> 00:04:58,852
I've got this headache and...

115
00:04:58,853 --> 00:05:00,760
Who is that person over there?

116
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:02,389
Because he's really
making me uncomfortable.

117
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,400
I'm making you uncomfortable
right now?

118
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:06,629
Dude, is there any reason why
you're not wearing any clothes now?

119
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,763
Hey, I think I might have
been abducted, all right?

120
00:05:08,764 --> 00:05:10,602
I believe I might
have been experimented on.

121
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:11,663
So there's no way
I'm going to touch

122
00:05:11,664 --> 00:05:12,800
these clothes
and compromise evidence.

123
00:05:12,801 --> 00:05:14,538
Okay, okay, Mr. Turk.

124
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:16,910
Please try to gain control
of your considerable person.

125
00:05:16,911 --> 00:05:19,472
Why don't you cover up with a
towel? That's why it's there.

126
00:05:19,473 --> 00:05:21,917
One size fits all, I hope.

127
00:05:25,824 --> 00:05:29,692
All right. I'll cover up
with the towel, but first...

128
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:32,462
Does somebody want
to check me for scars?

129
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:34,823
Oh, good Lord.

130
00:05:40,338 --> 00:05:43,272
<i>I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth</i>

131
00:05:43,273 --> 00:05:46,832
<i>I know, you know
They just don't have any proof</i>

132
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:49,880
<i>Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend</i>

133
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:53,941
<i>Your worst inhibitions tend
to psych you out in the end</i>

134
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,422
Are you really willing
to just dismiss the idea

135
00:06:02,423 --> 00:06:04,154
that there's life
on other planets?

136
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,628
This is what I got. I know
he was dragged out there.

137
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:08,665
Otherwise, no sign of assault.
Nothing taken.

138
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,927
Aside from the embarrassment
of waking up naked in a field,

139
00:06:10,928 --> 00:06:12,936
we've got nothing
to hang our hats on.

140
00:06:14,706 --> 00:06:16,332
I guess technically we could
have hung our hats on his...

141
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,534
Shawn.
Sorry.

142
00:06:18,543 --> 00:06:20,100
Look, if it's not
the alien thing,

143
00:06:20,101 --> 00:06:22,008
then how do you explain
the memory loss,

144
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:24,013
the confusion, the fact that
he saw a little green man?

145
00:06:24,014 --> 00:06:25,480
Hallucinations.
No.

146
00:06:25,481 --> 00:06:27,244
What? Dude,
you're the expert here.

147
00:06:27,245 --> 00:06:28,842
Come on, man,
there's got to be some drug

148
00:06:28,843 --> 00:06:31,114
that would cause a combination
of those three things.

149
00:06:31,115 --> 00:06:32,713
Think. Drugs.

150
00:06:33,191 --> 00:06:34,886
Oh, you're asking me?
Sure.

151
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:37,717
Let me see.

152
00:06:38,763 --> 00:06:40,229
Off the top of my head,

153
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,390
any SSRIs, Tramadol,

154
00:06:42,391 --> 00:06:45,299
Bupropion,
proton pump inhibitors.

155
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,064
That's what I'm talking about.
Thank you.

156
00:06:47,065 --> 00:06:49,071
Venlafaxine, Ropinirole.

157
00:06:49,072 --> 00:06:50,333
That's good work
from you, buddy.

158
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:52,500
B-adrenoreceptor antagonists.

159
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:53,941
Okay, gold star for Gus.

160
00:06:53,942 --> 00:06:56,877
Phencyclidine,
Ketamine, Bofotenine.

161
00:06:56,878 --> 00:06:58,073
You're not going to stop,
are you?

162
00:06:58,074 --> 00:06:59,547
Did I already say Venlafaxine?

163
00:06:59,548 --> 00:07:01,643
There's no way to be sure.

164
00:07:02,153 --> 00:07:03,677
Wait, wait a second.

165
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:06,689
Didn't he say something to
you about smelling lavender?

166
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,224
Yeah. He said right
before he blacked out,

167
00:07:08,225 --> 00:07:10,088
he remembered
the strong scent of lavender

168
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:11,888
and seeing barbed wire.

169
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,658
Right.
Wait a second.

170
00:07:14,432 --> 00:07:15,830
Gus, that's not
a hallucination.

171
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:16,958
That's a location.

172
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:19,230
That's what I'm saying! And
I know exactly where it is.

173
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:22,400
Dude, I've driven by
this place at least twice.

174
00:07:23,463 --> 00:07:26,874
The question is,
what are the cops doing here?

175
00:07:27,178 --> 00:07:29,441
<i>...body of
another male Caucasian, early 30s,</i>

176
00:07:29,442 --> 00:07:31,812
<i>possible 314.
Officers on scene.</i>

177
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:34,078
Johnny.

178
00:07:35,453 --> 00:07:36,442
Oh.

179
00:07:37,923 --> 00:07:38,912
Oh.

180
00:07:54,372 --> 00:07:57,135
Look, I saw the picture of
that Turk guy in the paper.

181
00:07:57,136 --> 00:07:59,107
Now, it's me in a field
naked, headache.

182
00:07:59,108 --> 00:08:00,200
You do the math.

183
00:08:00,201 --> 00:08:02,212
Do you remember seeing
anything out of the ordinary?

184
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:04,748
I don't remember much at all.

185
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:07,909
So, you just woke up in a field
wearing nothing but your birthday suit?

186
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,384
Look,
I told you yes already.

187
00:08:09,385 --> 00:08:10,784
Are you going to
give me a hard time?

188
00:08:10,785 --> 00:08:11,843
'Cause I'm a little
freaked out as it is.

189
00:08:11,844 --> 00:08:13,651
And can somebody
get me a bigger towel?

190
00:08:13,652 --> 00:08:15,590
This thing is like the size
of a washcloth.

191
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:17,589
What are you,
some kind of pervert?

192
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,720
Cut him some slack.
He's just doing his job.

193
00:08:19,721 --> 00:08:21,094
You think
he gets his jollies

194
00:08:21,095 --> 00:08:22,633
taking pictures
of your ding dong?

195
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:24,395
Lassy.

196
00:08:24,396 --> 00:08:25,526
What are you guys
doing here?

197
00:08:25,527 --> 00:08:28,196
This is my case.
You gave it to me, remember?

198
00:08:28,197 --> 00:08:30,536
Look, this is a copycat,
okay?

199
00:08:30,537 --> 00:08:32,769
He saw Turk's picture in the
paper. He's looking for attention.

200
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,868
So, he wakes up and sees
Turk in the paper naked,

201
00:08:34,869 --> 00:08:36,879
humiliated, the butt of
jokes at the water cooler

202
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,881
and says, "Hmm, how can I
make this work for myself?"

203
00:08:38,882 --> 00:08:39,973
What?

204
00:08:39,974 --> 00:08:41,278
Plus,
it's really itchy out here.

205
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,616
When you get your master's
degree in criminology,

206
00:08:43,617 --> 00:08:44,984
then you can call me.

207
00:08:44,985 --> 00:08:47,786
In the meantime, I got a
half-eaten Enchirito in my car.

208
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:53,854
All right, here we go.
You're up.

209
00:08:53,855 --> 00:08:54,955
What?
Do it.

210
00:08:54,956 --> 00:08:56,590
I'm not doing that.
Dude.

211
00:08:56,591 --> 00:08:58,157
I took the fat guy
in the police station.

212
00:08:58,158 --> 00:08:59,224
I'm not doing that.

213
00:08:59,225 --> 00:09:00,770
This is a much better pull.
I'm not doing that, Shawn.

214
00:09:00,771 --> 00:09:02,636
We're partners. Gus.

215
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:10,976
What does this case have
to do with a tanning salon?

216
00:09:10,977 --> 00:09:12,413
It's the middle
of winter in Santa Barbara.

217
00:09:12,414 --> 00:09:14,644
Those dudes looked like
gingerbread men without tan lines.

218
00:09:14,645 --> 00:09:16,379
They fake and they bake.

219
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,148
Shawn, exactly how close did
you look at these naked guys?

220
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:19,416
Too close.

221
00:09:19,417 --> 00:09:22,491
My heightened observational skills
are considered a gift by most,

222
00:09:22,492 --> 00:09:24,151
but I'm here to tell you,
it can be a burden.

223
00:09:24,152 --> 00:09:25,958
How do you know
it's this place?

224
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:30,527
Keiser didn't have any
streaks on his buttocks, okay?

225
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,259
That screams
the Insta-Tan process

226
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,803
and this is the only
place that does that.

227
00:09:33,804 --> 00:09:35,134
Right.

228
00:09:36,741 --> 00:09:38,901
Plus, they both live within a
mile and a half of this joint.

229
00:09:38,902 --> 00:09:40,001
Uh-huh.

230
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:48,247
I can't ring this.
Hello? Hello?

231
00:09:48,248 --> 00:09:49,808
Look, I'm going to
snoop around, okay?

232
00:09:49,809 --> 00:09:52,947
You find out if Turk or Keiser
were here. And if so, when?

233
00:09:52,948 --> 00:09:56,083
Oh, Shawn, Shawn.
This is not going to work.

234
00:09:56,084 --> 00:09:57,627
Dude,
I've got to do my thing.

235
00:09:57,628 --> 00:09:59,287
I've got to mix
it up nice. But...

236
00:09:59,288 --> 00:10:01,729
You always complain you don't
get to do the questiony part.

237
00:10:02,067 --> 00:10:03,590
Questiony part. Gus.

238
00:10:03,591 --> 00:10:05,636
Right.
You're forgetting...

239
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:09,863
May I help you?

240
00:10:10,308 --> 00:10:12,435
Yes. I'm here for
a tanning appointment.

241
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,472
For yourself?

242
00:10:15,473 --> 00:10:18,674
Yes, for the Insta-Tan
process. I would like that.

243
00:10:18,675 --> 00:10:19,806
But...

244
00:10:20,051 --> 00:10:21,517
What?
You...

245
00:10:21,518 --> 00:10:22,575
Yes.

246
00:10:22,954 --> 00:10:24,683
I don't understand.

247
00:10:25,423 --> 00:10:27,014
Okay, look, screw it.
I can't do it.

248
00:10:27,015 --> 00:10:28,922
Have you seen either of
these two guys here before?

249
00:10:28,923 --> 00:10:30,688
Fred Turk or Philip Keiser?

250
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,897
Shawn. Shawn.

251
00:10:34,632 --> 00:10:36,724
Okay, both Turk and Keiser
not only have been here,

252
00:10:36,725 --> 00:10:37,824
but they're regulars.

253
00:10:37,825 --> 00:10:40,301
He says, it's always the single guys
who try to keep up with their tans.

254
00:10:40,302 --> 00:10:41,667
Single guys?
Yeah.

255
00:10:41,668 --> 00:10:42,728
Maybe that's it.

256
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:45,173
Maybe some woman is targeting
singles at the salon.

257
00:10:45,643 --> 00:10:47,075
The question is,
what kind of loser thinks

258
00:10:47,076 --> 00:10:49,477
getting a tan is going to
help him score a woman?

259
00:10:54,085 --> 00:10:55,143
Dad?

260
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,847
Dad, what are you doing here?

261
00:10:59,848 --> 00:11:02,585
The real question is,
what are you doing here?

262
00:11:02,586 --> 00:11:04,923
Well, George Hamilton,
we're on a case.

263
00:11:04,924 --> 00:11:08,522
Or maybe you missed the pictures of
the guys in the paper in the field.

264
00:11:08,523 --> 00:11:10,499
Yes, of course I saw it.
The nudist guy in the field,

265
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,535
thinks he was abducted
by aliens.

266
00:11:12,536 --> 00:11:14,696
Idiot. What does that
have to do with this place?

267
00:11:14,697 --> 00:11:16,330
Well,
they're both regulars here.

268
00:11:16,331 --> 00:11:17,600
They both
happen to be single,

269
00:11:17,601 --> 00:11:19,164
so this could be
a stalking case.

270
00:11:19,165 --> 00:11:21,268
Wait a second, your dad is single
and he comes here all the time.

271
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:22,812
Everybody comes here.

272
00:11:22,813 --> 00:11:24,348
What is that?
What?

273
00:11:26,851 --> 00:11:29,910
Exfoliating scrub with pumice.

274
00:11:29,911 --> 00:11:31,011
Whatever, Shawn.
All I know is,

275
00:11:31,012 --> 00:11:33,249
when I varnish my boat
and I don't want it to streak,

276
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,621
I sand off a layer first.
Same thing goes with tanning.

277
00:11:35,622 --> 00:11:37,717
That is the single
most disturbing analogy

278
00:11:37,718 --> 00:11:39,387
I've ever heard
in my entire life.

279
00:11:39,388 --> 00:11:40,760
Where are they?
Who?

280
00:11:40,761 --> 00:11:42,856
<i>The Queer Eye guys.
I know they're here somewhere.</i>

281
00:11:42,857 --> 00:11:43,991
Gus, what are their names?

282
00:11:43,992 --> 00:11:45,557
How am I supposed to know,
Shawn?

283
00:11:45,558 --> 00:11:48,161
Carson and Jai and
the guy with the glasses.

284
00:11:48,162 --> 00:11:50,673
Oh, yeah, who cooks
the fish. Right.

285
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:55,108
Shawn, you know what
your real problem is?

286
00:11:55,109 --> 00:11:56,578
You got yourself another case

287
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:58,171
and, as usual,
you're short sighted.

288
00:11:58,172 --> 00:11:59,442
You think
it's all impressive

289
00:11:59,443 --> 00:12:01,006
'cause you see a couple of
nude guys in a field.

290
00:12:01,007 --> 00:12:02,108
You put a fix on them here.

291
00:12:02,109 --> 00:12:03,210
Well, it's not enough.

292
00:12:03,211 --> 00:12:04,276
This is what we know.

293
00:12:04,277 --> 00:12:06,322
Both these guys are trying
to impress someone,

294
00:12:06,323 --> 00:12:07,550
which means
a woman was involved

295
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:10,525
and that same woman
was with them in the field.

296
00:12:10,526 --> 00:12:12,459
Shawn saw a woman's
shoe strap in the field.

297
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:16,523
How or why she connects to
them, I just don't know yet.

298
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:19,299
Well, you're not
looking close enough.

299
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:24,864
Believe me, I've looked just
about as close as I can bear.

300
00:12:27,378 --> 00:12:28,674
I'm with you
on the aliens thing.

301
00:12:28,675 --> 00:12:32,442
They're here and they swapped
out my father with José Eber.

302
00:12:32,443 --> 00:12:33,778
I think
your dad might be right.

303
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:35,716
I think we should get Turk
and Keiser in the same room

304
00:12:35,717 --> 00:12:36,946
and actually ask them
some questions.

305
00:12:36,947 --> 00:12:38,078
Fine. Let's do it.

306
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,988
The rule is, all slacks,
all the time, no exceptions.

307
00:12:40,989 --> 00:12:43,527
I hear that. I've reached my
naked man quota for the year.

308
00:12:47,031 --> 00:12:48,293
Hello?

309
00:12:50,034 --> 00:12:51,365
We'll be there.

310
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,897
Step inside, guys.

311
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,666
Your case just
became legitimate.

312
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:56,933
Consider yourself hired.

313
00:12:56,934 --> 00:12:58,838
I need answers
and I need them quick.

314
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:00,069
Well, I do have
something, Chief.

315
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,805
I'm getting a...
I'm getting skin pigment.

316
00:13:02,806 --> 00:13:05,543
Bronzed, glistening...

317
00:13:08,653 --> 00:13:10,745
Adonis-like skin pigment.

318
00:13:10,746 --> 00:13:12,083
You lead me
through this field,

319
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:13,383
you let me ask one question,

320
00:13:13,384 --> 00:13:16,086
I guarantee it's going to
come down to spray tanning.

321
00:13:20,665 --> 00:13:22,928
Well, this guy's never seen
the inside of a tanning salon.

322
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:24,467
I don't think
he ever saw the sun.

323
00:13:24,468 --> 00:13:26,559
<i>You've got 24 hours.
Call me with something.</i>

324
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,605
Grab a CSI.
Verify time of death.

325
00:13:28,606 --> 00:13:32,200
Looks like we might have to open
a kennel for all these copycats.

326
00:13:32,844 --> 00:13:34,572
Well,
we're back to square one.

327
00:13:34,573 --> 00:13:35,669
I don't know, Shawn.

328
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,475
Maybe square one
is the answer.

329
00:13:37,476 --> 00:13:39,276
Maybe this is something
beyond our comprehension.

330
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,873
Something otherworldly.

331
00:13:40,874 --> 00:13:42,748
I hear what you're saying.
Do me a favor.

332
00:13:42,749 --> 00:13:44,320
What?
Let go of the alien angle.

333
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:45,649
We need something solid, Gus.

334
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,623
Something... Something
concrete. You heard the Chief.

335
00:14:00,338 --> 00:14:01,327
Dude,

336
00:14:01,906 --> 00:14:03,736
how do you feel
about leprechauns?

337
00:14:03,737 --> 00:14:06,298
Oh,
hello, me buckos. I'm Marvin.

338
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:10,039
Welcome to Shenanigans, home of the
world-famous Blarney Stone fajitas.

339
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,375
Hello, Marvin.

340
00:14:11,376 --> 00:14:12,972
We're here to
speak with a leprechaun.

341
00:14:12,973 --> 00:14:14,677
Ha,
ha, very funny. Please stop.

342
00:14:14,678 --> 00:14:17,481
My tummy's aching
from laughing so hard.

343
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:18,987
You guys want a table or what?

344
00:14:18,988 --> 00:14:20,853
Dude, give me some props. He's
got a hat with a buckle on it,

345
00:14:20,854 --> 00:14:21,948
everything's green.

346
00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:23,652
What?
He's not a leprechaun.

347
00:14:23,653 --> 00:14:24,954
Will you do me a favor?

348
00:14:24,955 --> 00:14:27,691
In your funny accent, will you
say, "magically delicious"?

349
00:14:32,337 --> 00:14:34,702
Is that the world-famous
clover stamp?

350
00:14:34,703 --> 00:14:35,829
That's the one.

351
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,396
Will you stamp
my buddy's wrist?

352
00:14:37,397 --> 00:14:39,305
Whatever floats your boat,
man.

353
00:14:39,306 --> 00:14:40,434
It's for our
nighttime events there.

354
00:14:40,435 --> 00:14:41,875
But, hey, you can have
it in the daytime, too.

355
00:14:41,876 --> 00:14:43,037
What nighttime events?

356
00:14:43,038 --> 00:14:44,512
We have speed dating here.

357
00:14:44,513 --> 00:14:45,775
Speed dating?
Yeah.

358
00:14:45,776 --> 00:14:47,612
Don't laugh. It's actually one
of our most popular events.

359
00:14:47,613 --> 00:14:49,743
Guys come in here, and they sign
up, they put down a hundred bucks

360
00:14:49,744 --> 00:14:50,844
and they get fixed up
with all sorts of people

361
00:14:50,845 --> 00:14:52,252
on little six minute
mini-dates.

362
00:14:52,253 --> 00:14:53,687
Did you say a hundred bucks?
Hundred bucks.

363
00:14:53,688 --> 00:14:55,088
How about fifty bucks
for three minute dates?

364
00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:56,352
Twenty five bucks
for a minute and a half.

365
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:59,055
I float you a ten spot, you introduce
us to somebody for 15 seconds.

366
00:15:01,566 --> 00:15:03,032
How about you guys
either get a table

367
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:04,624
or I'm going to have to
ask you to leave the podium?

368
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:05,690
How about
"magically delicious"?

369
00:15:05,691 --> 00:15:06,895
Will you say
"magically delicious"?

370
00:15:06,896 --> 00:15:09,063
No, but I can say police if you
don't get your butts out of here.

371
00:15:09,064 --> 00:15:12,371
Hello, there.
I'm Marvin. Welcome to Shenanigans,

372
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:15,772
home of the world famous
Blarney Stone fajitas.

373
00:15:15,773 --> 00:15:18,077
Yeah, I tried the speed
dating thing a couple of times.

374
00:15:18,383 --> 00:15:19,974
I just didn't think it had
anything to do with the case

375
00:15:19,975 --> 00:15:22,348
and I was a little
embarrassed about it.

376
00:15:22,349 --> 00:15:23,511
Wow.

377
00:15:23,512 --> 00:15:24,918
You paid a hundred bucks?

378
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:28,651
Mr. Turk, we feel it has everything
to do with the case, all right?

379
00:15:28,652 --> 00:15:33,220
Both Phil Keiser and the guy who turned
up dead attended these speed dating events.

380
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:42,972
Do you remember anything
strange happening there?

381
00:15:42,973 --> 00:15:45,406
Or meeting anyone odd?

382
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:48,912
The only odd thing was that the ladies
didn't take to me like they usually do.

383
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:54,449
That's beyond odd.
I can't imagine why, Fred.

384
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,542
Here's the thing, though.

385
00:15:55,543 --> 00:15:58,315
Other strange things have been happening
to me ever since I was at the event.

386
00:15:58,316 --> 00:15:59,377
Like what?

387
00:15:59,378 --> 00:16:01,356
Well, I applied
for a job recently.

388
00:16:01,357 --> 00:16:02,619
I was the perfect candidate.

389
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,559
I had several interviews and
then suddenly after the final one,

390
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,824
I was rejected.

391
00:16:07,365 --> 00:16:10,232
Let me ask you a question,
Freddy, and please be honest.

392
00:16:10,701 --> 00:16:11,997
Were you on time
for these interviews?

393
00:16:11,998 --> 00:16:13,695
Yes, why do you ask?

394
00:16:14,605 --> 00:16:15,866
I have no reason.

395
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:17,303
I think there's
a woman involved here,

396
00:16:17,304 --> 00:16:18,636
who had it out
for these guys.

397
00:16:18,637 --> 00:16:21,108
We need to get a firsthand look
at this speed dating phenomenon.

398
00:16:21,109 --> 00:16:22,236
Not for a hundred bucks,
we don't.

399
00:16:22,237 --> 00:16:23,506
Gus, please,
leave it to me.

400
00:16:23,507 --> 00:16:25,207
Let me get this straight.

401
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,613
There is a dead body

402
00:16:26,614 --> 00:16:28,275
and a murderer
loose in our city

403
00:16:28,276 --> 00:16:30,114
and you want the Santa
Barbara Police Department

404
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:31,677
to pay for you
to go on dates?

405
00:16:31,678 --> 00:16:33,222
Yes, that's correct.

406
00:16:33,223 --> 00:16:35,815
I mean, I suppose we could
split it if we had to.

407
00:16:35,816 --> 00:16:38,828
What's that called?
Going... Going Dutch?

408
00:16:39,664 --> 00:16:41,063
Go Dutch.

409
00:16:46,437 --> 00:16:49,873
I am not paying for your
dating services, Mr. Spencer.

410
00:16:50,241 --> 00:16:51,969
Look, here's the catch,
Chief.

411
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,476
I'm going to be reading
these people, psychically.

412
00:16:54,477 --> 00:16:55,909
And I don't need six minutes.

413
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,241
<i>Give me 40 seconds
with these people.</i>

414
00:16:57,242 --> 00:16:59,475
I'll be able to tell you if they
had anything to do with the murder.

415
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,039
And you know what?
Gus and I,

416
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,745
we really did
try to negotiate

417
00:17:02,746 --> 00:17:04,514
some sort of
partial usage rate,

418
00:17:04,515 --> 00:17:06,146
but we got shut down
by that leprechaun.

419
00:17:06,147 --> 00:17:08,282
Mr. Spencer, enough.

420
00:17:08,283 --> 00:17:10,589
Wait,
I'm getting something else.

421
00:17:12,096 --> 00:17:15,462
It's a woman in sexy
high heeled strappy shoes.

422
00:17:15,463 --> 00:17:17,558
<i>She's roughly 5'2".</i>

423
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:22,169
Jules, may I please have a
pen and something to write on?

424
00:17:39,457 --> 00:17:40,548
"To Lassy,

425
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:42,114
"on the Alpine
highway of life,

426
00:17:42,115 --> 00:17:43,716
"you're my all-weather tires.

427
00:17:43,717 --> 00:17:45,318
"H and K's, Shawn."

428
00:17:45,863 --> 00:17:46,886
What the hell is this?

429
00:17:46,887 --> 00:17:49,158
H and K's stands for
hugs and kisses.

430
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:51,235
Not that part. This part.

431
00:17:51,702 --> 00:17:52,793
It's a tire pattern.

432
00:17:52,794 --> 00:17:55,338
Run it through the system and we'll
know what kind of car she drives.

433
00:17:56,807 --> 00:17:58,273
Okay. I'll give
you a shot at this,

434
00:17:58,274 --> 00:17:59,933
but you're not going alone.

435
00:17:59,934 --> 00:18:03,036
O'Hara, I want you to go along
with these guys undercover

436
00:18:03,037 --> 00:18:04,546
working things
from the other side.

437
00:18:04,547 --> 00:18:06,775
See if you can sift any
information from these women.

438
00:18:06,776 --> 00:18:07,874
Will do.

439
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,680
Chief, I think that's
the best idea you've ever had.

440
00:18:09,681 --> 00:18:11,744
Shawn, I am so glad
you're on board.

441
00:18:11,745 --> 00:18:13,755
Detective Lassiter,
I'm going to need you, too.

442
00:18:13,756 --> 00:18:15,518
We don't know what
this woman's type is,

443
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:17,184
and, besides,
you're now leading the case.

444
00:18:17,185 --> 00:18:18,852
Yeah, you know, Chief,
with all due respect,

445
00:18:18,853 --> 00:18:21,090
I'm really pretty busy working
this case from another angle.

446
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:22,791
I mean,
I ran the toxicology reports

447
00:18:22,792 --> 00:18:25,391
and I found that all three victims
tested positive for trace amounts

448
00:18:25,392 --> 00:18:26,935
of the street drug GHB.

449
00:18:26,936 --> 00:18:29,335
But our dead guy had a
pre-existing heart condition.

450
00:18:29,336 --> 00:18:30,998
So there was a pattern.

451
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:32,098
I think
the murder was accidental.

452
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:36,442
And I like that track. Now, follow it
up by going to the speed dating thing.

453
00:18:37,682 --> 00:18:39,775
It's just a date, Lassiter.

454
00:18:40,084 --> 00:18:42,814
You do know how to conduct
yourself on a date, don't you?

455
00:18:45,281 --> 00:18:47,118
Okay, I checked out
your tread pattern.

456
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:48,248
Thank you.

457
00:18:48,249 --> 00:18:50,816
It's a high performance tire
manufactured after 2002.

458
00:18:50,817 --> 00:18:52,088
So we're looking for a woman

459
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,960
who drives a late model sports
car, probably American-made.

460
00:18:54,961 --> 00:18:56,293
And 5'2"
and likes strappy heels.

461
00:18:56,294 --> 00:18:57,834
Check. Question.

462
00:18:58,236 --> 00:18:59,896
Is that what
you're wearing?

463
00:18:59,897 --> 00:19:01,460
What's wrong with what I'm
wearing? I always wear this.

464
00:19:01,461 --> 00:19:03,529
Exactly. Lassy,
you look like a cop.

465
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:05,075
Now come on, man.

466
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:09,503
Is that your holster?
Of course it is.

467
00:19:09,504 --> 00:19:12,742
You're here to speed date,
man, not shoot somebody.

468
00:19:12,743 --> 00:19:15,284
You got to loosen up.
Come on, take off the tie.

469
00:19:15,285 --> 00:19:17,252
I'm not taking fashion tips
from you.

470
00:19:17,253 --> 00:19:19,481
You need to show
some chest hair.

471
00:19:19,482 --> 00:19:21,524
Chicks dig
the sternum bush.

472
00:19:21,525 --> 00:19:23,684
Jules, back me up
on the stern bush.

473
00:19:23,685 --> 00:19:26,855
I'm going to go see what these women
have to say before this thing starts.

474
00:19:27,665 --> 00:19:30,758
Bye, Jules. All right, come
on. Let's go, Simon Cowell.

475
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:32,495
You got the salt and pepper,
man. It's nice.

476
00:19:32,496 --> 00:19:35,163
I'm not taking off my tie
just 'cause you tell me to.

477
00:19:35,164 --> 00:19:36,899
Fine. Suit yourself.

478
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,033
Ladies and gentlemen.

479
00:19:41,135 --> 00:19:44,510
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you all for coming.

480
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:47,982
For those of you who are new,
I will explain how this works.

481
00:19:47,983 --> 00:19:49,075
Okay?

482
00:19:49,076 --> 00:19:52,451
You will pick a numbered table
to begin your first date.

483
00:19:52,452 --> 00:19:54,616
Every six minutes,
you will hear...

484
00:19:55,681 --> 00:19:58,023
That will indicate
the end of your time together.

485
00:19:58,024 --> 00:19:59,925
And your next date will begin.

486
00:19:59,926 --> 00:20:02,191
Now, I know, six minutes
is not a long time

487
00:20:02,192 --> 00:20:03,357
to get to know someone.

488
00:20:03,358 --> 00:20:05,731
That's why myself
and the other staff

489
00:20:05,732 --> 00:20:09,033
will use the questionnaires
you filled out to match you up.

490
00:20:09,034 --> 00:20:10,197
Okay?

491
00:20:10,198 --> 00:20:12,798
Love is in the air.
I can smell it.

492
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:13,968
I smell cabbage.

493
00:20:13,969 --> 00:20:15,910
Let the dating begin.

494
00:20:17,014 --> 00:20:19,208
Shawn, that's a nice name.

495
00:20:19,209 --> 00:20:21,251
Yeah, it's okay.
It's okay.

496
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:25,316
My last name is
Hofen-Inderheine.

497
00:20:26,557 --> 00:20:28,285
Yeah,
it's been a tough life.

498
00:20:28,286 --> 00:20:29,516
Wow.

499
00:20:29,517 --> 00:20:31,458
Kids can be cruel.
Yeah.

500
00:20:31,896 --> 00:20:34,523
You know you could
probably change that.

501
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,394
What's your mom's
maiden name?

502
00:20:36,395 --> 00:20:37,693
Buzzteets.

503
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,633
Wow, yeah.

504
00:20:40,071 --> 00:20:41,401
Teets, as in...

505
00:20:41,402 --> 00:20:44,133
Yeah. Yeah. All my
ancestry, we're farmers.

506
00:20:44,134 --> 00:20:46,402
Oh, hey,
I was raised on a farm.

507
00:20:46,403 --> 00:20:47,636
No kidding.

508
00:20:47,637 --> 00:20:51,044
I had this most adorable
little pet goat named Cassie.

509
00:20:51,045 --> 00:20:52,240
Goat?
Yeah.

510
00:20:52,241 --> 00:20:54,681
Did you ever have any,
you know, pets growing up?

511
00:20:54,682 --> 00:20:55,775
What were their names?

512
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:57,718
Oh, what's your
favorite color?

513
00:20:59,346 --> 00:21:00,947
Move along.

514
00:21:01,592 --> 00:21:03,684
I think these people
might have more luck dating

515
00:21:03,685 --> 00:21:05,159
if they'd ask more
interesting questions.

516
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,253
I just hope,
I don't get pile driven.

517
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:16,067
Carlton, I hope
this isn't too forward of me,

518
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,467
but you have kind eyes.

519
00:21:20,745 --> 00:21:21,972
Thank you.

520
00:21:21,973 --> 00:21:23,512
This is uncanny.
I know.

521
00:21:23,513 --> 00:21:26,606
God, you know, I never meet anyone
I connect with at these things.

522
00:21:26,607 --> 00:21:29,516
That's why I didn't even bother dressing
up. I mean I've given up a little.

523
00:21:29,517 --> 00:21:30,951
I think you look great.

524
00:21:30,952 --> 00:21:32,317
Thank you.

525
00:21:32,318 --> 00:21:35,052
So, what kind of
car do you drive?

526
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:36,316
Excuse me?

527
00:21:36,317 --> 00:21:40,194
You drive a sports car?
Mustang, maybe? 2003?

528
00:21:41,098 --> 00:21:42,997
That's kind of
a shallow question, isn't it?

529
00:21:42,998 --> 00:21:44,863
Do you like hanging out
in fields?

530
00:21:44,864 --> 00:21:47,732
Okay, you know what,
I think this date's over.

531
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:49,362
No, I've got
three minutes left.

532
00:21:49,363 --> 00:21:50,929
Where were you on
the night of the 18th?

533
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,272
You know, normally,
I would wear a dress.

534
00:21:53,811 --> 00:21:54,800
And heels?

535
00:21:55,513 --> 00:21:57,377
Yeah, I guess, maybe.

536
00:21:57,378 --> 00:22:00,143
Like open-toed
strappy ones?

537
00:22:00,144 --> 00:22:01,479
What? Huh?
Huh?

538
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:03,946
Is that what you
have in your closet?

539
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:06,854
A lot of high-heeled shoes?

540
00:22:07,758 --> 00:22:09,589
Do you have a foot fetish?

541
00:22:09,894 --> 00:22:11,054
No.

542
00:22:15,132 --> 00:22:18,328
Look at us. A couple kids
on a proper date, huh?

543
00:22:18,329 --> 00:22:19,800
You got some goosebumps?

544
00:22:19,801 --> 00:22:21,302
Shawn, this isn't a date.
It's work.

545
00:22:21,303 --> 00:22:22,998
You're absolutely right.
But, hey,

546
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:25,336
you still got six minutes
to ask me anything you want.

547
00:22:25,337 --> 00:22:26,500
So, what do you
want to know?

548
00:22:26,501 --> 00:22:28,737
What are you dying to know about
Shawn Spencer, the man? The man.

549
00:22:28,738 --> 00:22:31,212
Oddly enough, I don't think I
have anything I'm dying to know.

550
00:22:31,213 --> 00:22:34,649
Okay, Jules, don't lie,
because lying is unbecoming.

551
00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:36,646
I'll go first.

552
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:39,085
You, me, Burgess Meredith,

553
00:22:39,086 --> 00:22:41,215
Hume Cronyn, Nipsey
Russell, deserted island,

554
00:22:41,592 --> 00:22:42,649
who are you going
to sleep with?

555
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,454
Wait, so it's you
or a bunch of dead guys?

556
00:22:44,455 --> 00:22:46,324
Fair. I'll give you
Scatman Crothers.

557
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:47,522
Dead.
Flip Wilson.

558
00:22:47,523 --> 00:22:48,791
Also dead.
Donald Pleasence.

559
00:22:48,792 --> 00:22:49,957
None of the above.
None of the above?

560
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:51,467
Jules, are you kidding me?
You got...

561
00:22:54,872 --> 00:22:56,999
You're going to miss me,
aren't you? A little bit.

562
00:22:57,741 --> 00:23:00,265
Have fun on your next date, but I
want you to think about that, okay?

563
00:23:00,266 --> 00:23:01,604
Like if that really happened.

564
00:23:01,605 --> 00:23:03,044
Bye, Shawn.

565
00:23:45,389 --> 00:23:48,688
Go on.
Tell her she looks pretty.

566
00:23:51,428 --> 00:23:53,453
Yeah, no can do.

567
00:24:00,938 --> 00:24:02,029
That's it, people.

568
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:04,471
You should have
completed all your dates.

569
00:24:04,472 --> 00:24:06,975
Please score your cards
and check up front at the bar

570
00:24:06,976 --> 00:24:10,171
and we will also tell you who you
matched from your questionnaires.

571
00:24:10,172 --> 00:24:11,338
Okay?

572
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:12,471
I'm sorry.

573
00:24:12,472 --> 00:24:13,538
Date's over.

574
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:15,106
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

575
00:24:15,107 --> 00:24:18,119
<i>I just haven't been a high-heel
guy since Single White Female.</i>

576
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,418
I just... Yeah.

577
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:22,182
Thank you.

578
00:24:22,183 --> 00:24:23,282
Dude,

579
00:24:23,283 --> 00:24:24,985
I think that Darcy girl
might be the one.

580
00:24:24,986 --> 00:24:26,153
She's the right height,

581
00:24:26,154 --> 00:24:27,355
<i>she drives an
'04 Trans Am.</i>

582
00:24:27,356 --> 00:24:29,455
And she wears
nothing but heels.

583
00:24:29,456 --> 00:24:30,556
How did you find out
about the heels?

584
00:24:30,557 --> 00:24:32,999
And she works in pharmaceutical
sales, just like you.

585
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,696
Now, would she have access
to that GHB stuff?

586
00:24:34,697 --> 00:24:37,205
Well, she certainly would have access
to the drugs to synthesize her own.

587
00:24:37,206 --> 00:24:39,138
That's sweet. Dude,
you got to ask her out.

588
00:24:39,139 --> 00:24:40,698
What? And go out
with a possible murderer?

589
00:24:40,699 --> 00:24:42,074
You must be out of your mind.
I'm not doing that.

590
00:24:42,075 --> 00:24:44,010
Gus, I got to see her on a date.
I got to see her in action.

591
00:24:44,011 --> 00:24:45,377
I got to look, I got to
listen, I got to feel.

592
00:24:45,378 --> 00:24:47,643
Shawn, if we think it's her,
let's tell Lassiter and Juliet

593
00:24:47,644 --> 00:24:48,706
and get them to bring her in.

594
00:24:48,707 --> 00:24:50,116
You see what happens when
we blurt out our theories.

595
00:24:50,117 --> 00:24:51,517
We totally whiffed
on the tanning salon.

596
00:24:51,518 --> 00:24:52,782
All right, fine.
You go out with her then.

597
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:55,654
I would, but
she matched up with you.

598
00:24:58,662 --> 00:25:00,960
Oh, give her the sweetness. Dude,
you got to give her the sweetness.

599
00:25:03,033 --> 00:25:05,695
This is a speed dating first.

600
00:25:09,373 --> 00:25:14,242
You and you are a 100% match from
your personality questionnaires.

601
00:25:14,445 --> 00:25:17,937
I smell love.
Come on. Come on.

602
00:25:27,224 --> 00:25:28,851
I need a drink.
I got to pee.

603
00:25:37,067 --> 00:25:38,465
Look, I don't know
what to say to her.

604
00:25:38,466 --> 00:25:40,331
I ran out of topics
on the way over here.

605
00:25:40,332 --> 00:25:42,268
Plus, she keeps wanting to rub
my head. What's up with that?

606
00:25:42,269 --> 00:25:44,533
Gus, everybody wants
to rub your head.

607
00:25:44,534 --> 00:25:46,541
Look, you're doing fine,
okay?

608
00:25:46,542 --> 00:25:47,701
Here, here.

609
00:25:47,702 --> 00:25:50,541
Here's a list of conversation
topics, basic starters.

610
00:25:50,542 --> 00:25:53,207
You got your ball, head on over
there. I'm right behind you.

611
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:56,012
"You're stranded on a deserted island
and you have to procreate the species."

612
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:57,075
Really?

613
00:25:57,454 --> 00:25:59,547
This is gold.
I give you gold.

614
00:26:08,565 --> 00:26:09,657
Yes!

615
00:26:10,901 --> 00:26:11,890
That was good.

616
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,498
Shawn?

617
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:20,598
Detective O'Hara.

618
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:22,076
Shawn,
what are you doing here?

619
00:26:22,077 --> 00:26:23,510
Bowling, at a high level.

620
00:26:23,511 --> 00:26:25,706
By yourself,
on a Saturday night?

621
00:26:25,707 --> 00:26:27,977
I'm in a league.
It's semi-pro.

622
00:26:27,978 --> 00:26:29,916
I could have gone pro, but you
know what, I made a choice.

623
00:26:29,917 --> 00:26:33,683
<i>I like to get 1
4- 15 hours of practice in... a week.</i>

624
00:26:33,684 --> 00:26:34,814
Wow.

625
00:26:34,815 --> 00:26:36,654
I had no idea you were
so serious about bowling.

626
00:26:36,655 --> 00:26:37,818
Quite serious.
Quite serious.

627
00:26:37,819 --> 00:26:39,657
Matter of fact, Lego wants
to sponsor me this year.

628
00:26:39,658 --> 00:26:41,060
Oh, my God.
That's great.

629
00:26:41,061 --> 00:26:43,598
They also want me to wear
shoes made out of Legos.

630
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:45,225
So, I'm torn.

631
00:26:45,602 --> 00:26:49,469
Okay. Well, I don't want to
interrupt your practicing.

632
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,632
Yeah, yeah,
I should get back.

633
00:26:51,633 --> 00:26:53,643
I'm really not here
to mess around.

634
00:26:55,713 --> 00:26:57,373
Oh, my God,
I am so rude.

635
00:26:57,374 --> 00:26:59,938
Kyle, Shawn.
Shawn, Kyle.

636
00:26:59,939 --> 00:27:02,280
No, that's my bowling hand.
There you go.

637
00:27:02,281 --> 00:27:04,649
Shawn works for
the police department.

638
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,086
He's a psychic.

639
00:27:06,087 --> 00:27:08,453
Oh, cool, a psychic.

640
00:27:08,454 --> 00:27:11,891
Nice. Can you tell me
anything about my future?

641
00:27:11,892 --> 00:27:15,591
Oh, Kyle, please. That's
not really how it works.

642
00:27:16,767 --> 00:27:18,427
Though I am...
I am getting something.

643
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,868
It's...
It's hazy, but...

644
00:27:21,338 --> 00:27:25,707
I'm sensing that you're going
to face a lot of rejection.

645
00:27:25,976 --> 00:27:26,999
Work-wise?

646
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,705
No. No. Not work-wise.

647
00:27:30,147 --> 00:27:31,170
Not work-wise.

648
00:27:31,171 --> 00:27:33,147
You know what?
I'm going to go.

649
00:27:33,148 --> 00:27:34,547
You kids get back
to doing your thing.

650
00:27:34,548 --> 00:27:37,279
You know, she bowl, then you
bowl, then she bowl and you bowl.

651
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,377
And you've got
the tight tuck

652
00:27:38,378 --> 00:27:41,049
and it's sweet and it's
perfect. See you, Jules.

653
00:27:45,295 --> 00:27:46,989
Okay, okay.

654
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,360
Hold on a second.
I'll be right back. Okay?

655
00:27:48,361 --> 00:27:49,626
Okay.

656
00:27:50,901 --> 00:27:52,162
Where the hell you been?

657
00:27:52,163 --> 00:27:55,102
Oh, sorry. Sorry. I ran into
somebody. How you doing? You okay?

658
00:27:55,103 --> 00:27:57,230
Too okay. She wants
to go back to my place.

659
00:27:57,231 --> 00:27:58,432
Oh, this is great.

660
00:27:58,433 --> 00:27:59,998
We'll get all the
information we need.

661
00:27:59,999 --> 00:28:02,135
No. The problem is I told
her I live at the beach.

662
00:28:02,136 --> 00:28:03,269
Why would you tell her that?

663
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,973
I don't know. I was trying
to impress her at the time.

664
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,537
I didn't realize I was going
to be dating her, Shawn.

665
00:28:06,538 --> 00:28:07,810
Okay. Okay. Okay.

666
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,511
Okay. Okay.
Let me think.

667
00:28:09,512 --> 00:28:12,519
Dude, I got it. You can
take her to my dad's place.

668
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,449
This is perfect. Look, just
give me a head start.

669
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:16,924
I'll prep.
I'll cover everything.

670
00:28:16,925 --> 00:28:18,961
Just drive slow, okay?
We can do this.

671
00:28:18,962 --> 00:28:20,393
All right, bye.

672
00:28:20,394 --> 00:28:21,861
Shawn... Just
listen, Dad. Just listen.

673
00:28:21,862 --> 00:28:23,091
Just hear me out.
Hear me out. Listen.

674
00:28:23,092 --> 00:28:25,225
This might actually
be fun for us.

675
00:28:25,226 --> 00:28:27,599
What, you expect me to stand outside
of my own house, in the cold,

676
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,230
getting bitten by bugs so
Gus can score with some girl?

677
00:28:30,231 --> 00:28:31,330
I don't think so.

678
00:28:31,331 --> 00:28:33,500
Okay. First of all, not
just some girl, okay?

679
00:28:33,501 --> 00:28:37,012
This dame is a looker. She's
a peach. She's a spicy tomato.

680
00:28:37,013 --> 00:28:39,742
And she may or
may not be a murderer.

681
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:42,076
Oh, she... Right, see,
I knew it. I knew it.

682
00:28:42,077 --> 00:28:44,142
This has nothing to do
with Gus finding a girl.

683
00:28:44,143 --> 00:28:47,712
This is about you using my house so
you can conduct a sting operation.

684
00:28:47,713 --> 00:28:49,655
Shawn,
it ain't going to happen.

685
00:28:49,656 --> 00:28:51,852
Okay, what are you doing?

686
00:28:51,853 --> 00:28:54,159
You're putting a negative
spin on things, as usual.

687
00:28:54,698 --> 00:28:55,687
Look,

688
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:57,829
might they have
a few more obstacles

689
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:00,836
than your typical couple if she turns
out to be a cold-blooded killer? Sure.

690
00:29:01,138 --> 00:29:02,229
But what if they really
fall in love, Dad?

691
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:06,208
Shawn, you've got about three
seconds to get out of my way.

692
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,933
One...

693
00:29:08,745 --> 00:29:09,904
That's cheating.
You're cheating.

694
00:29:09,905 --> 00:29:11,345
No, no, Dad.

695
00:29:11,915 --> 00:29:13,974
Quiet. Shut up. Shut up.

696
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,782
Please, come in.

697
00:29:24,895 --> 00:29:28,331
Oh! Oh. You lit a
fire. That was fast.

698
00:29:30,901 --> 00:29:31,959
Have a seat.

699
00:29:33,403 --> 00:29:35,267
Welcome to my home.

700
00:29:35,268 --> 00:29:36,670
Wow.

701
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:39,405
You really like fishing.

702
00:29:39,406 --> 00:29:40,500
No. God, no.

703
00:29:43,513 --> 00:29:44,843
I'm just playing.

704
00:29:44,844 --> 00:29:47,247
Yes, actually, I do
love fishing. Yes.

705
00:29:47,551 --> 00:29:50,041
Love it.
Love me some fishing.

706
00:29:50,042 --> 00:29:53,521
Some wide mouth bass,
some perch, some sturgeon.

707
00:29:55,993 --> 00:29:57,255
Sturgeon is a fish, right?

708
00:29:59,696 --> 00:30:01,163
Okay. Okay.

709
00:30:03,934 --> 00:30:06,163
What is that?
What?

710
00:30:06,164 --> 00:30:08,227
That smell. It's like...

711
00:30:09,706 --> 00:30:12,003
It's like gardenia
with a hint of mango.

712
00:30:12,004 --> 00:30:13,167
What?

713
00:30:15,178 --> 00:30:18,409
Oh, my God.
Did you take a bath?

714
00:30:20,751 --> 00:30:23,948
Yes, Shawn.
I took a bath.

715
00:30:24,354 --> 00:30:28,050
Yes, you know, like security
safes, vaults with locking devices.

716
00:30:28,051 --> 00:30:29,990
Do you crack safes?

717
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,487
With bubbles?

718
00:30:31,488 --> 00:30:32,822
Are you
my little safecracker?

719
00:30:32,823 --> 00:30:34,659
Well, I haven't
actually cracked any safes.

720
00:30:34,865 --> 00:30:37,128
It's this new soap
that I'm using.

721
00:30:37,129 --> 00:30:38,632
It foams more.

722
00:30:38,633 --> 00:30:40,464
It foams more?

723
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:42,333
Dad, it's called
bubble bath.

724
00:30:42,334 --> 00:30:44,930
Well, I don't think it's
officially called bubble bath

725
00:30:44,931 --> 00:30:48,135
if the bubbles happen
accidentally, but whatever, Shawn.

726
00:30:48,136 --> 00:30:50,702
Who are you?
Where's my father?

727
00:30:51,682 --> 00:30:54,047
I've accused you of being a
lot of things in my lifetime,

728
00:30:54,048 --> 00:30:56,051
but metrosexual
was never one of them.

729
00:30:58,587 --> 00:31:01,214
I am not a metrosexual. I just
happen to be an average Joe

730
00:31:01,215 --> 00:31:03,315
who is concerned about
his health and appearance.

731
00:31:03,316 --> 00:31:05,656
I have taken baths
for years, Shawn.

732
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:06,717
That is where I think.

733
00:31:06,718 --> 00:31:10,823
I have solved dozens and dozens of gruesome,
gruesome murder cases sitting in a tub.

734
00:31:10,824 --> 00:31:14,735
FYI, historically, real men
have always taken baths.

735
00:31:15,272 --> 00:31:16,261
Name one.

736
00:31:16,773 --> 00:31:18,933
<i>John Wayne. Rio Bravo. Bath.</i>

737
00:31:18,934 --> 00:31:20,738
You got anybody
since the Old West?

738
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,744
What's that?
That's my roast.

739
00:31:24,745 --> 00:31:25,906
It's done.
You made a roast?

740
00:31:25,907 --> 00:31:28,416
For Christ's sake, Shawn. It's
not a quiche. It's man food.

741
00:31:28,417 --> 00:31:31,612
I would have gladly gone out and hunted
it and killed it if I had the time.

742
00:31:31,613 --> 00:31:33,814
And unless you get out of my
way, I am going to kill you.

743
00:31:33,815 --> 00:31:34,878
No, you can't go in there.

744
00:31:34,879 --> 00:31:37,221
You go in there, you're going to
compromise this entire investigation.

745
00:31:37,222 --> 00:31:38,920
What is being compromised
is my pot roast.

746
00:31:38,921 --> 00:31:41,088
It is drying out
as we speak.

747
00:31:41,089 --> 00:31:42,152
Please.

748
00:31:42,153 --> 00:31:44,291
No, Dad. No. God.

749
00:31:44,868 --> 00:31:47,427
Please, kids, pay no mind. Just
passing through to the kitchen.

750
00:31:47,428 --> 00:31:50,098
Got to squeeze
some juices on my roast.

751
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,463
Gus?

752
00:31:51,464 --> 00:31:54,408
Oh, that's Henry.
He's my roommate.

753
00:31:54,644 --> 00:31:56,702
Yeah,
he's just making a roast.

754
00:31:56,703 --> 00:31:59,373
All done. All done.
Just had to...

755
00:32:01,718 --> 00:32:02,707
Okay.

756
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,288
Look, it's fine that you
have a roommate, but...

757
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:10,084
Honestly,
it's cramping our style.

758
00:32:10,085 --> 00:32:11,149
It is?

759
00:32:11,928 --> 00:32:14,522
What do you say we go
somewhere more private?

760
00:32:15,499 --> 00:32:16,761
Private like where?

761
00:32:17,801 --> 00:32:20,133
I know a back road
that leads to a field.

762
00:32:21,004 --> 00:32:22,493
We can park the car.

763
00:32:22,494 --> 00:32:25,063
Yeah. I don't think
we should go to the field.

764
00:32:26,076 --> 00:32:27,600
Why?
Why?

765
00:32:29,479 --> 00:32:32,413
You don't like me.
That's it, isn't it?

766
00:32:32,414 --> 00:32:35,245
No, no, my hay fever.
My hay fever.

767
00:32:35,246 --> 00:32:37,717
The last place my nasal
passages want to be is a field.

768
00:32:37,718 --> 00:32:41,451
No, no, no,
she's not your killer, Shawn.

769
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:43,760
Look in this girl's eyes, son.

770
00:32:45,028 --> 00:32:46,052
They're sincere.

771
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,818
You don't think
I'm pretty.

772
00:32:47,819 --> 00:32:48,921
What?
You...

773
00:32:48,922 --> 00:32:50,465
You just felt bad
because you...

774
00:32:50,466 --> 00:32:53,024
We matched up at the speed dating
and you didn't know what to say,

775
00:32:53,025 --> 00:32:54,364
so you pretended.

776
00:32:54,365 --> 00:32:56,099
Wow. You put all that
together, huh?

777
00:32:58,141 --> 00:33:00,302
Those are real tears, Shawn.

778
00:33:01,344 --> 00:33:02,641
You're right.

779
00:33:04,047 --> 00:33:06,379
That's real snot.

780
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:16,156
Hello. Lassy?

781
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:20,518
You what? Okay, okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

782
00:33:20,764 --> 00:33:22,321
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad,
I got to go.

783
00:33:22,322 --> 00:33:23,626
What do you mean
you got to go?

784
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:24,757
You got this covered.

785
00:33:24,758 --> 00:33:26,734
This poor girl is there weeping
on your best friend's shoulder

786
00:33:26,735 --> 00:33:27,928
in my house
and you're leaving?

787
00:33:27,929 --> 00:33:29,368
What do you do?
What am I supposed to do?

788
00:33:29,369 --> 00:33:31,031
I know. I know. It's a tough
one. It's a real thinker.

789
00:33:32,476 --> 00:33:35,070
I got it.
Draw yourself another bath.

790
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:36,506
Shawn. Shawn.

791
00:33:44,121 --> 00:33:45,451
Picked him up
a couple of hours ago.

792
00:33:45,452 --> 00:33:48,046
Found him loitering outside
one of the speed dater's homes.

793
00:33:48,047 --> 00:33:49,216
When Lassiter
checked his place,

794
00:33:49,217 --> 00:33:51,759
he found a stack of the
questionnaires in his apartment.

795
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,195
<i>Tell me about these,
Marvin.</i>

796
00:33:56,166 --> 00:33:59,623
<i>Look, I don't know anything
about any crime. I just...</i>

797
00:33:59,624 --> 00:34:02,262
I used the names and the
numbers to get dates, man.

798
00:34:02,263 --> 00:34:03,430
That's it.

799
00:34:03,431 --> 00:34:05,371
I don't have a hundred bucks to
slap down on some entrance fee.

800
00:34:05,372 --> 00:34:07,602
Not on my crap salary.
So, yeah.

801
00:34:07,603 --> 00:34:09,974
And besides,
that's why they go there.

802
00:34:09,975 --> 00:34:11,979
They go there for dates,
right? So why not me?

803
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,139
Why don't you
think about that

804
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:16,310
while you're trying to take a
crap in front of six other guys?

805
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,119
Look, okay, come on,
all right?

806
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,420
All I did was I took some
questionnaires out of the trash.

807
00:34:22,726 --> 00:34:23,953
That's it.

808
00:34:23,954 --> 00:34:25,516
What's the charge?
Not littering?

809
00:34:25,517 --> 00:34:28,028
So if you don't have anything
more, I'd like to get to work.

810
00:34:28,029 --> 00:34:30,066
You think
he's telling the truth?

811
00:34:36,072 --> 00:34:37,470
Not by a long shot.

812
00:34:37,471 --> 00:34:39,838
Now, look at him, he's not the right
height, he doesn't even own a car.

813
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,399
I mean he can't
match the tire tread.

814
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,411
He's cocky.
He thinks he's on a roll,

815
00:34:43,412 --> 00:34:45,003
but I'm inside his head,
Chief.

816
00:34:45,004 --> 00:34:46,911
And I'm about to hang a
Lopez around the frontal lobe

817
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:49,247
and shoot right out
of his nose onto his vest.

818
00:34:49,753 --> 00:34:50,777
You smell where I'm stepping?

819
00:34:51,878 --> 00:34:52,943
He had a partner.

820
00:34:52,944 --> 00:34:54,284
You let him go back to work,

821
00:34:54,285 --> 00:34:56,119
he's going to lead us
right to the person.

822
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,888
And I'll be able to
pick them out psychically.

823
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:00,258
You have my word.

824
00:35:00,259 --> 00:35:01,319
I better.

825
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:04,897
<i>Lassiter, let him go.</i>

826
00:35:06,469 --> 00:35:07,663
<i>Excuse me?</i>

827
00:35:08,305 --> 00:35:10,238
<i>Release him.
Release him?</i>

828
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:13,833
<i>Why am I going to release
him? Why would I release him?</i>

829
00:35:13,834 --> 00:35:15,206
<i>Release him.</i>

830
00:35:16,146 --> 00:35:17,134
What?

831
00:35:17,135 --> 00:35:19,304
Why don't you get your
shillelagh and get out of here?

832
00:35:19,305 --> 00:35:20,405
You got it.

833
00:35:21,718 --> 00:35:24,083
Excuse me,
may I help you people?

834
00:35:24,084 --> 00:35:25,552
Yeah. We're here for
the speed dating event.

835
00:35:25,553 --> 00:35:27,646
Oh, I'm sorry,
it's already begun.

836
00:35:27,647 --> 00:35:30,090
Oh, wait.
I remember you.

837
00:35:31,795 --> 00:35:34,456
Look, you seem
like a decent fellow

838
00:35:34,457 --> 00:35:36,122
and I'd hate for you
to waste another $100.

839
00:35:36,123 --> 00:35:38,223
But I was watching you

840
00:35:38,224 --> 00:35:40,097
and you're not
very good at this.

841
00:35:40,098 --> 00:35:42,570
Police business. Scat.

842
00:35:44,307 --> 00:35:47,503
Okay, I need to breathe and I
need some space to do my thing.

843
00:35:47,504 --> 00:35:48,771
Okay.

844
00:35:50,313 --> 00:35:51,644
Shawn.

845
00:35:51,848 --> 00:35:53,678
Oh, good, buddy,
you got the message.

846
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:55,079
It's not Darcy.
You're in the clear.

847
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,914
You're going to pay, Shawn. You
are going to pay. Believe me.

848
00:35:57,915 --> 00:35:59,614
No offense, but it's tough
to feel threatened by you

849
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,451
when you're wearing that
shirt. Is that a hibiscus?

850
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:03,514
It's not my shirt, Shawn.
It's your dad's shirt.

851
00:36:03,515 --> 00:36:05,685
He had to loan me one because
mine was covered in snot tears.

852
00:36:05,686 --> 00:36:08,662
I can't... Did you know
he also takes bubble baths?

853
00:36:08,663 --> 00:36:09,755
So did John Wayne.

854
00:36:09,756 --> 00:36:11,459
I know, but can you
name one other guy?

855
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,830
What's going on?

856
00:36:12,831 --> 00:36:15,267
I solved the case. It's
actually got a decent twist.

857
00:36:15,268 --> 00:36:16,669
Have a seat.

858
00:36:18,441 --> 00:36:20,374
Well, I'm actually
kind of an adventurist.

859
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:23,536
You know, I was caught in an avalanche
once and in order to survive,

860
00:36:23,537 --> 00:36:26,547
I drank my own urine
and I ate three of my toes,

861
00:36:26,548 --> 00:36:29,776
which is, you know, maybe why
you saw me limp when I came in.

862
00:36:29,777 --> 00:36:32,218
Hey, big guy, you mind if
I... You mind if I cut in here?

863
00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:34,050
Oh, I don't know.
We're kind of in a...

864
00:36:34,051 --> 00:36:36,285
You're going to be okay.
Okay, all right.

865
00:36:37,294 --> 00:36:39,727
I really hope it wasn't rude.
It seemed a little rude.

866
00:36:39,728 --> 00:36:43,129
Well, actually, I should thank
you because he was awful.

867
00:36:43,466 --> 00:36:45,228
That is a very nice name.

868
00:36:45,229 --> 00:36:47,099
But you're kind of cute.

869
00:36:52,776 --> 00:36:54,504
So, navy blue's
your favorite color?

870
00:36:54,505 --> 00:36:55,873
Mine's green.

871
00:36:55,874 --> 00:36:57,309
You know you seem European.

872
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,244
You're sure you don't
have family history there?

873
00:36:59,245 --> 00:37:00,575
What's your mother's
maiden name?

874
00:37:00,576 --> 00:37:04,141
So, after volunteering for the
animal shelter, I decided...

875
00:37:04,142 --> 00:37:05,914
Can I just... Can I
stop you for a moment?

876
00:37:05,915 --> 00:37:08,355
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

877
00:37:09,092 --> 00:37:13,152
Everybody, I'm sorry, if I could just
get your attention for a sec here.

878
00:37:13,153 --> 00:37:14,287
I'm sorry.

879
00:37:15,932 --> 00:37:17,762
I want to pick this up
right where we left off

880
00:37:17,763 --> 00:37:19,323
if there's any time
left on the clock, okay?

881
00:37:19,324 --> 00:37:22,029
Because you seem like a terrific
person. You deserve someone special.

882
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:24,072
Someone who makes you feel
safe, but also a little dirty,

883
00:37:24,073 --> 00:37:25,163
you know
what I'm talking about?

884
00:37:25,164 --> 00:37:26,935
Everyone deserves
someone special,

885
00:37:26,936 --> 00:37:29,204
each and every one
of you. All of you.

886
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:32,179
Look, is your perfect match here
tonight? I don't know. I'm not sure.

887
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,681
But the point is, you're here and
you put your hearts on the line

888
00:37:34,682 --> 00:37:36,513
and that's all
that really matters.

889
00:37:36,514 --> 00:37:40,954
Unfortunately, there are two people
here that do not share your pure desires.

890
00:37:40,955 --> 00:37:42,991
They're not here
to find their soul mates.

891
00:37:42,992 --> 00:37:44,923
They're not here
to fall in love.

892
00:37:44,924 --> 00:37:46,723
As a matter of fact,
they're not even single.

893
00:37:49,032 --> 00:37:53,229
You, Glenda and you,
Marvin, are a couple.

894
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,566
An odd couple, to be sure.
But a couple.

895
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:57,605
Matter of fact,
you're married.

896
00:37:57,606 --> 00:37:59,038
That is absurd.

897
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:00,541
The tan lines
on your fingers

898
00:38:00,542 --> 00:38:02,770
where your wedding rings
used to be will prove...

899
00:38:02,771 --> 00:38:04,472
Please, not with
the tanning thing again.

900
00:38:04,473 --> 00:38:06,036
...that not only
are you married,

901
00:38:06,037 --> 00:38:08,310
but that tanning had something
to do with this investigation.

902
00:38:08,311 --> 00:38:10,284
Thank you, Chief.
Now the question is,

903
00:38:10,285 --> 00:38:12,877
why would a married couple
infiltrate a singles event?

904
00:38:12,878 --> 00:38:14,115
Well, the answer is simple.

905
00:38:14,116 --> 00:38:17,091
It's a perfect place
to commit their crime.

906
00:38:18,027 --> 00:38:19,618
They're here to rob you,
ladies and gentlemen.

907
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:23,427
To steal from you the one thing
that is invariably your own.

908
00:38:24,367 --> 00:38:25,629
Identity.

909
00:38:25,902 --> 00:38:27,391
I told you that
leprechaun was bad.

910
00:38:27,392 --> 00:38:30,097
Marvin did
copy the questionnaires

911
00:38:30,098 --> 00:38:31,730
to get these people's
phone numbers and addresses.

912
00:38:31,731 --> 00:38:35,004
And you, Glenda, cleverly found
the answers to questions like,

913
00:38:35,005 --> 00:38:36,101
<i>"What's your mother's
maiden name?"</i>

914
00:38:36,102 --> 00:38:37,668
<i>"What's your favorite color?"
"Did you have any pets?"</i>

915
00:38:37,669 --> 00:38:39,304
"What are their names?"
"Name all the Bee Gees."

916
00:38:39,305 --> 00:38:42,179
Those are the same questions that
you get at the bank from security

917
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,151
when you try to
authorize a credit card.

918
00:38:44,152 --> 00:38:45,311
So what was left?

919
00:38:45,312 --> 00:38:48,618
Get the credits card numbers from these poor
guys without them knowing they were robbed.

920
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:50,282
So you came up with a plan.

921
00:38:50,283 --> 00:38:53,226
<i>You followed them,
you drugged them.</i>

922
00:38:53,227 --> 00:38:57,288
<i>You took down the numbers and
you deposited them naked in a field</i>

923
00:38:57,289 --> 00:39:00,028
<i>where they
woke up disoriented,</i>

924
00:39:00,029 --> 00:39:02,297
grassy-assed,
but none the wiser.

925
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:05,235
Fred Turk did see
a little alien that day.

926
00:39:05,236 --> 00:39:07,298
Except it wasn't
an extraterrestrial.

927
00:39:07,299 --> 00:39:12,713
It was Marvin in his ridiculous,
stupid green leprechaun costume.

928
00:39:13,183 --> 00:39:15,742
And they would have gotten
away with it, too, folks,

929
00:39:15,743 --> 00:39:17,581
if it wasn't for
their last victim.

930
00:39:17,582 --> 00:39:20,384
The one who didn't
quite wake up.

931
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:25,756
Not so fast!

932
00:39:25,757 --> 00:39:28,127
Because that isn't
even the worst of it.

933
00:39:28,531 --> 00:39:33,024
The worst of it is that you
two stole a very valuable seat

934
00:39:33,025 --> 00:39:35,331
that belonged
to a single person.

935
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:39,205
A single person who believes
in the power of love.

936
00:39:39,742 --> 00:39:42,574
You should be
ashamed of yourselves.

937
00:39:42,575 --> 00:39:44,237
Both of you.

938
00:39:49,919 --> 00:39:53,012
Murder, wow.
That's a speed dating first.

939
00:39:53,013 --> 00:39:54,885
Be sure to check up
at the bar

940
00:39:54,886 --> 00:39:57,950
and see who you match from
your questionnaires. Okay?

941
00:40:02,966 --> 00:40:04,296
I'm sorry about that.

942
00:40:04,297 --> 00:40:05,390
Wow.
You know, I just...

943
00:40:05,391 --> 00:40:06,764
It was from here, though.
You know that.

944
00:40:06,765 --> 00:40:10,499
So, we were talking about
what? We were talking about...

945
00:40:12,141 --> 00:40:14,301
Beagles.
Beagles, that's so sweet.

946
00:40:14,302 --> 00:40:16,901
Because you like them and you
put little sweaters on them.

947
00:40:16,902 --> 00:40:18,105
Yeah, well, sometimes.

948
00:40:18,106 --> 00:40:19,808
Excuse me, sorry.
May I cut in?

949
00:40:21,351 --> 00:40:22,908
It's my parole officer.

950
00:40:22,909 --> 00:40:24,247
Oh.
Yeah.

951
00:40:24,248 --> 00:40:25,377
Okay.
I'm sorry.

952
00:40:25,378 --> 00:40:27,082
Sure.
I'm sorry.

953
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,193
Sorry.
Where did you...

954
00:40:33,194 --> 00:40:34,854
I thought you... I thought
you were on a date.

955
00:40:34,855 --> 00:40:36,420
I was. It's over.

956
00:40:36,421 --> 00:40:37,988
Over?
Mmm-hmm.

957
00:40:37,989 --> 00:40:40,159
Over, like
he laid one on you

958
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,533
on the front porch and you
got little butterflies, over?

959
00:40:42,534 --> 00:40:44,629
Or you... You pretended
like you had a headache

960
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,571
and you called it
quits early, over?

961
00:40:46,572 --> 00:40:50,601
Not that it's any of your
business, but he can't bowl.

962
00:40:50,602 --> 00:40:52,909
And that's a deal-breaker.
I see.

963
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:55,074
Hmm. But, look, the
only reason I sat down

964
00:40:55,075 --> 00:40:58,279
is because I wanted
to clear one thing up.

965
00:40:58,588 --> 00:40:59,815
I don't take any stock

966
00:40:59,816 --> 00:41:02,254
in those profile
matching thingies

967
00:41:02,255 --> 00:41:03,519
we did
the other night.

968
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,589
Jules, I was just
messing around. I...

969
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:09,859
I copied your card over
your shoulder. Like verbatim.

970
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:13,424
What, you thought maybe I
sew my own pajamas? That's...

971
00:41:13,425 --> 00:41:15,527
Right, okay.
Well, good,

972
00:41:15,528 --> 00:41:18,835
because I don't want there
to be any weirdness between us

973
00:41:18,836 --> 00:41:21,569
and it seems like we're going
to be working together a lot.

974
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:22,940
All the time.
Yeah.

975
00:41:22,941 --> 00:41:26,037
So, nice job on the case, by
the way. Thank you very much.

976
00:41:26,038 --> 00:41:27,445
Yeah.
Thank you.

977
00:41:27,446 --> 00:41:29,177
Okay, all right,
I'll see you at work.

978
00:41:29,178 --> 00:41:31,777
That's how we do it,
work style. Yeah.

979
00:41:32,422 --> 00:41:34,390
See you at work.
See you.

980
00:41:38,795 --> 00:41:39,920
Where's she going?

981
00:41:39,921 --> 00:41:42,429
You know what, I think
I undersold the fajitas.

982
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,657
Well, it wouldn't
be the first time

983
00:41:43,658 --> 00:41:45,097
a female walked out on you
in the middle of a meal.

984
00:41:45,098 --> 00:41:47,260
Oh, please, Gus, we're
talking about Jules here.

985
00:41:47,261 --> 00:41:48,860
It's not like
we were on a date.

986
00:41:48,861 --> 00:41:51,565
Plus it wouldn't work out.
It would never work out.

987
00:41:51,566 --> 00:41:53,403
I'd have to
really bowl well.

988
00:41:53,404 --> 00:41:55,671
And apparently
that's a deal-breaker.

989
00:41:58,481 --> 00:42:00,175
You know
how awful those are?

990
00:42:00,176 --> 00:42:02,843
I'm hungry, man.
We don't have to stay.

991
00:42:04,087 --> 00:42:06,452
Dude. Jerk chicken.

992
00:42:06,453 --> 00:42:08,353
Oh, you know,
that's right.

993
00:42:19,002 --> 00:42:22,562
<i>In between the lines
there's a lot of obscurity</i>

994
00:42:22,563 --> 00:42:25,970
<i>I'm not inclined
to resign to maturity</i>

995
00:42:25,971 --> 00:42:29,442
<i>If it's all right
then you're all wrong</i>

996
00:42:29,443 --> 00:42:33,845
<i>But why bounce around
to the same damn song?</i>

997
00:42:33,846 --> 00:42:38,046
<i>You'd rather run
when you can't crawl</i>

998
00:42:40,423 --> 00:42:43,858
<i>I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth</i>

999
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:47,361
<i>I know, you know
They just don't have any proof</i>

1000
00:42:47,362 --> 00:42:50,262
<i>Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend</i>

1001
00:42:50,263 --> 00:42:54,359
<i>Your worst inhibitions tend
to psych you out in the end</i>

1002
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,405
<i>I know, you know</i>

1003
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,874
<i>I know, you know</i>
