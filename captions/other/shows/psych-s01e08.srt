1
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:15,983
Faster than a speeding bullet,
more powerful than...

2
00:00:17,022 --> 00:00:18,147
Hey.

3
00:00:18,148 --> 00:00:19,349
Hey.

4
00:00:21,193 --> 00:00:23,787
Where did these
comics come from?

5
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,163
Gus, right?

6
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,431
Come here.

7
00:00:30,402 --> 00:00:33,064
Well, at least
you're not a tattletale.

8
00:00:34,473 --> 00:00:36,804
What's the big deal?
All the kids read them.

9
00:00:36,805 --> 00:00:38,273
Yeah, well, all the kids
don't live in this house,

10
00:00:38,274 --> 00:00:41,209
and all the kids don't have a
police officer as a father, Shawn.

11
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,713
So what? So, these things
make cops look like idiots

12
00:00:43,714 --> 00:00:47,614
who'd rather flash a signal in
the sky than do real police work.

13
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:49,618
They set a bad example.
They do not.

14
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:51,745
Shawn, don't argue with me.

15
00:00:51,746 --> 00:00:53,255
Do you have any idea
of how many kids' brains

16
00:00:53,256 --> 00:00:55,883
I have to scoop up off the driveway
because they think they can fly?

17
00:00:55,884 --> 00:00:57,187
Those kids are dumb.

18
00:00:57,188 --> 00:00:58,557
Shawn, these things
are a fantasy.

19
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,927
Real heroes do not wear a cape and they
don't wear their underwear on the outside.

20
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:03,829
The guys who wear capes...

21
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,869
They're on angel dust.

22
00:01:08,506 --> 00:01:09,905
Come here.

23
00:01:18,216 --> 00:01:20,445
You want to know
what a real hero is?

24
00:01:20,446 --> 00:01:22,713
What?
He's flesh and blood.

25
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:27,252
He wears a badge. He lays it on the
line every time he walks the beat.

26
00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:31,227
Shawn, do you really
want to be a hero someday?

27
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:32,818
Yes, sir.

28
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:34,592
Become a cop.

29
00:01:34,932 --> 00:01:36,957
Get your head
out of the clouds.

30
00:01:39,237 --> 00:01:43,298
All right, let's see if we can
make this thing useful somehow, huh?

31
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:47,138
Hit the showers.

32
00:02:01,491 --> 00:02:04,220
<i>Somebody needs
a hot oil massage.</i>

33
00:02:04,221 --> 00:02:05,417
Pardon?

34
00:02:05,418 --> 00:02:07,485
<i>Stress?
Tough day at the office?</i>

35
00:02:07,486 --> 00:02:10,589
<i>Who are you kidding? You'll
probably never get those reports typed.</i>

36
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,031
<i>Who is this?
Shawn.</i>

37
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:13,193
Spencer.

38
00:02:13,194 --> 00:02:14,998
<i>Great, you were already
thinking about me.</i>

39
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:16,560
<i>You know, you should
roll your head both directions</i>

40
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:18,800
<i>if you really want that
to work. Okay, where are you?</i>

41
00:02:18,801 --> 00:02:20,102
<i>On the phone.
Where are you?</i>

42
00:02:20,103 --> 00:02:22,269
You know damn well where
I am. How can you see me?

43
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,436
<i>Do you really want to know?</i>

44
00:02:23,437 --> 00:02:25,946
I don't ask questions I don't
want to know the answer to.

45
00:02:25,947 --> 00:02:28,108
<i>Then never ask a boyfriend
if he thinks your sister's hot.</i>

46
00:02:28,109 --> 00:02:30,015
<i>I don't have a sister.
How about a boyfriend?</i>

47
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,074
Where are you?

48
00:02:31,075 --> 00:02:34,350
<i>Well, there's a spectral plane where
all of our auras are visible, see.</i>

49
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:36,653
<i>When a soul is tortured
or stressed, like yourself...</i>

50
00:02:36,654 --> 00:02:37,783
Okay, never mind.

51
00:02:37,784 --> 00:02:39,350
<i>You asked.
You know what, Shawn?</i>

52
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:40,861
I have a really
hectic day today.

53
00:02:40,862 --> 00:02:42,625
<i>The chief, she's...
Out of the office.</i>

54
00:02:42,626 --> 00:02:46,259
<i>Going to a seminar on non-lethal
weaponry with Lassiter? Out of town?</i>

55
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,962
<i>She sort of
left you in charge?</i>

56
00:02:47,963 --> 00:02:52,440
Okay, psychic. Give me the details.
How did you figure that out?

57
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:55,033
<i>Most of it is in
her day planner.</i>

58
00:02:58,847 --> 00:03:01,337
You cannot be
in the chief's office.

59
00:03:01,338 --> 00:03:02,940
<i>Oh, come on.
She's not going to know.</i>

60
00:03:02,941 --> 00:03:05,110
<i>Notice how no one ever
looks in here? Why is that?</i>

61
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:08,019
<i>What are you guys so afraid
of? It's not like the belly bites.</i>

62
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,319
<i>She's actually a pretty kick-back
lady if you give her a chance.</i>

63
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,985
<i>Look what she's done with this
place, it's really warm in here.</i>

64
00:03:12,986 --> 00:03:16,657
<i>I know I can't stay away.
And have you tried this chair?</i>

65
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:21,102
Okay, you have five seconds
to get your butt out of...

66
00:03:22,805 --> 00:03:24,431
Actually, you know what?
Stay right there.

67
00:03:24,432 --> 00:03:26,633
<i>Ooh, indecisive.
I like that.</i>

68
00:03:31,347 --> 00:03:34,282
Take a look at that.
Tell me what you think.

69
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:38,276
Flower doodle in the upper
right-hand corner is excellent.

70
00:03:38,277 --> 00:03:41,049
This horse at the bottom doesn't
look anything like My Little Pony.

71
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,113
The writing, not the...

72
00:03:43,114 --> 00:03:44,819
That's a dog.

73
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:47,089
I draw when I get anxious.

74
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,096
I think you made a wise decision
not going into animation, Juliet.

75
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:51,722
Mmm.
Okay, fine.

76
00:03:51,723 --> 00:03:53,198
Something about
a missing kid.

77
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,566
He's not a kid. He's 18.

78
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:59,595
<i>And he's only been gone for 24
hours, so technically he's not missing.</i>

79
00:03:59,596 --> 00:04:02,005
You want my help.
I'm not sure yet.

80
00:04:02,006 --> 00:04:03,736
His name is
Malone Breyfogle.

81
00:04:03,737 --> 00:04:05,744
Malone Breyfogle?
Mmm-hmm.

82
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:09,009
I'll tell you this much, kid's been
lifted up by his underwear more than once.

83
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,947
He seems like a good kid.

84
00:04:10,948 --> 00:04:12,918
Honor roll,
never been in trouble.

85
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,578
His mother's worried sick.

86
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:17,021
<i>You can't do anything until
he's been missing for 48 hours?</i>

87
00:04:17,022 --> 00:04:18,148
That's so stupid.

88
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:20,591
Exactly. I know
the rules and regulations.

89
00:04:20,592 --> 00:04:23,152
They made sense
when I memorized them, but...

90
00:04:23,153 --> 00:04:25,289
When you have to look into
some poor mother's eyes

91
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,198
and tell her she can't worry about
her son until he's two days missing...

92
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,998
That is really depressing.
Consider me hired.

93
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:33,563
You're not hired.
I can't pay you.

94
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,333
If it turns out
there's something to it,

95
00:04:35,334 --> 00:04:37,344
I'll make sure you get put on
the case. That's all I can do.

96
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:38,976
Juliet,

97
00:04:39,514 --> 00:04:43,040
I'm quite sure we can work out
some kind of services exchange.

98
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:46,950
You see, I like to do a little sketching
myself, and sometimes I need a model.

99
00:04:46,951 --> 00:04:48,283
Huh.

100
00:04:50,992 --> 00:04:53,017
Was that inappropriate?

101
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:56,688
Felt okay.

102
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:03,531
Let me get this straight. I left in the
middle of work to come check out a case,

103
00:05:03,532 --> 00:05:06,298
which is not a case, in which
we likely won't get paid.

104
00:05:06,299 --> 00:05:07,771
Who are you
kidding right now?

105
00:05:07,772 --> 00:05:09,273
I pulled you
out of a Starbucks.

106
00:05:09,274 --> 00:05:10,969
Where you were pretending
to finish your route

107
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,635
that you actually
finished yesterday

108
00:05:12,636 --> 00:05:15,272
so we could do
a tiny favor for Juliet

109
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,715
that will grant us much
larger favors in the future.

110
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:24,888
Preferably ones that I can't mention in
the presence of nuns or men of the cloth.

111
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:27,653
Oh, hello. Thank you
so much for coming.

112
00:05:27,654 --> 00:05:30,322
Come in.
Can I get you boys anything?

113
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:35,594
They'll be ready in a minute.

114
00:05:35,595 --> 00:05:37,966
I can't believe you're letting
that woman make us pancakes.

115
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:39,629
She offered, Gus.

116
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,229
Tell me you're not excited
about pancakes.

117
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,298
She's worried sick.
Cooking helps her cope.

118
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:45,310
How do you know that? How
do you know it doesn't?

119
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,471
Do you boys want
your syrup warmed up?

120
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,071
I don't need it, Mrs.
Breyfogle, but Gus does,

121
00:05:50,072 --> 00:05:52,344
so, I guess, yes.

122
00:05:52,345 --> 00:05:53,885
You're the one
who won't eat cold syrup.

123
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,648
Yeah, but I'm working you
into the conversation.

124
00:05:55,649 --> 00:05:57,781
Now she knows your name.

125
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:02,227
I'm just afraid something
terrible has happened.

126
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,126
Here you go.
Mmm-hmm.

127
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:09,026
My son, Malone, has been
acting so strange lately.

128
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:11,025
Strange how?

129
00:06:11,026 --> 00:06:14,367
Well, he worked so hard to
get a paid summer internship

130
00:06:14,368 --> 00:06:16,532
with a big
computer company,

131
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:20,442
then turned it down at the last
second, wouldn't tell me why.

132
00:06:20,443 --> 00:06:21,945
Rarely leaves his room.

133
00:06:21,946 --> 00:06:25,710
Even his two oldest friends, Rob and
Don, tell me they hardly get to see him.

134
00:06:25,711 --> 00:06:28,309
Have you spoken with Rob and
Don since Malone disappeared?

135
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,118
No. I spoke to their parents.
Both boys are at computer camp.

136
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:35,157
All right.

137
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,394
These are delicious.
Yes.

138
00:06:37,395 --> 00:06:39,226
But I need
to see his room.

139
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:13,390
Are you all right?

140
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:17,830
I feel the answer
is in the light.

141
00:07:18,736 --> 00:07:20,135
The light?

142
00:07:30,215 --> 00:07:31,681
Shawn?

143
00:07:31,682 --> 00:07:34,809
Will you tell the spirit
to hurry the hell up?

144
00:07:42,594 --> 00:07:43,891
Oh, yes.

145
00:07:44,162 --> 00:07:46,722
Yes, I'm definitely
feeling something here.

146
00:07:47,565 --> 00:07:49,465
It's good.

147
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:51,325
It's nice.

148
00:07:51,326 --> 00:07:52,732
What? What is it?

149
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:55,430
This mattress. It feels
like one of those mattresses

150
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:58,270
where you can bounce a bowling ball,
but the glass of wine doesn't spill.

151
00:07:58,271 --> 00:08:00,504
Gus, go find a glass of wine
and a bowling ball.

152
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:05,273
Mrs. Breyfogle,

153
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:09,308
I feel we'll find
a clue in here.

154
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:33,506
<i>I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth</i>

155
00:08:33,507 --> 00:08:36,670
<i>I know, you know
They just don't have any proof</i>

156
00:08:36,671 --> 00:08:39,943
<i>Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend</i>

157
00:08:39,944 --> 00:08:43,817
<i>Your worst inhibitions tend
to psych you out in the end</i>

158
00:08:50,694 --> 00:08:53,924
How does some 18-year-old kid still
living at home make that kind of money?

159
00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:55,395
Lemonade stand?

160
00:08:55,396 --> 00:08:58,297
That is, if instead of
lemons, he's using heroin.

161
00:08:58,298 --> 00:09:01,859
Whatever it is, anything that pays in
stacks of cash like that can't be legal.

162
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,927
Or healthful.

163
00:09:02,928 --> 00:09:07,135
It's obvious what happened. Malone
was involved in some shady dealings.

164
00:09:07,136 --> 00:09:10,906
He's either off on a spending spree or
things got a little too shady for him.

165
00:09:10,907 --> 00:09:12,038
So, what now?

166
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:14,309
Find his friends.
Computer camp, please.

167
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,816
Malone's rolling in dough.

168
00:09:15,817 --> 00:09:18,648
Whatever he's doing, they're with
him. We find them, we find him.

169
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:20,689
The question is where.

170
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,680
Wait a second.

171
00:09:22,892 --> 00:09:24,722
You don't already know
where he is?

172
00:09:24,723 --> 00:09:27,819
Gus, I'm a professional gathering
information, okay? I'm getting there.

173
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,023
You know, Shawn, I...

174
00:09:30,024 --> 00:09:32,066
I just thought you were a
little better than this.

175
00:09:32,067 --> 00:09:33,361
Just a little. All
right, what is this?

176
00:09:33,362 --> 00:09:35,198
You know where he is?
Of course I do.

177
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,363
While you're playing with light
switches and ordering breakfast,

178
00:09:37,364 --> 00:09:39,066
I was investigating a case.

179
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:40,335
I see.

180
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,371
Okay.

181
00:09:42,372 --> 00:09:44,412
Okay, I'll bite.

182
00:09:44,413 --> 00:09:47,449
Where is he,
Chocolate Columbo?

183
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,911
Tri-Con.

184
00:09:48,912 --> 00:09:51,077
Do what?
Tri-Con.

185
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:53,586
The Tri-Annual Comic Book
and Science Fiction Convention

186
00:09:53,587 --> 00:09:55,316
is in Santa Barbara
this weekend.

187
00:09:55,317 --> 00:09:57,483
You saw all those comic books
in Malone's room.

188
00:09:57,484 --> 00:09:58,992
You're 18 years old.
You have a ton of cash

189
00:09:58,993 --> 00:10:01,858
burning a hole in your pocket
and you love comics.

190
00:10:01,859 --> 00:10:04,398
Where else would you go to
spend your disposable income?

191
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,455
Think, Shawn.

192
00:10:05,456 --> 00:10:07,865
Gus, I apologize. That's
brilliant. Thank you.

193
00:10:07,866 --> 00:10:09,597
Let's verify it
so we can go check it out.

194
00:10:09,598 --> 00:10:11,639
Shawn, I'm sure he's there.
There's no doubt.

195
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,730
You're sure?
Yep.

196
00:10:12,731 --> 00:10:13,797
How's that?

197
00:10:21,617 --> 00:10:23,583
Are those directions
to the convention center?

198
00:10:23,584 --> 00:10:25,950
I found it
in his wastebasket.

199
00:10:29,457 --> 00:10:31,117
You know,
in case I never said it,

200
00:10:31,118 --> 00:10:34,389
I was really pleased
when you were named as chief.

201
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,192
Interim chief. I'm sure
that's only temporary.

202
00:10:38,193 --> 00:10:39,254
Mmm-hmm.

203
00:10:39,255 --> 00:10:43,463
It's true that the outgoing
chief was important to me.

204
00:10:43,464 --> 00:10:46,665
He was my mentor.
Made me the cop I am today.

205
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:47,729
Mmm-hmm.

206
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,609
I know the outside perception is that the
force was a real boys' club under him,

207
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:57,744
so I thought it was really smart
when they named a, you know, woman.

208
00:10:58,753 --> 00:11:00,380
All right, honey.

209
00:11:01,556 --> 00:11:03,751
Excuse me, what?
I love you.

210
00:11:04,025 --> 00:11:05,048
Huh?

211
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:06,615
Okay.

212
00:11:06,616 --> 00:11:09,858
Yeah, I'll just see you
when we get back. Okay.

213
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:14,933
I'm sorry, Detective,
were you saying something?

214
00:11:14,934 --> 00:11:16,231
No, I wasn't.

215
00:11:19,841 --> 00:11:21,741
We can't just
walk into the con.

216
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,901
I'm sorry, "the con"?

217
00:11:23,902 --> 00:11:25,001
Yeah.

218
00:11:25,002 --> 00:11:27,137
You're calling a place filled
with overweight teenagers

219
00:11:27,138 --> 00:11:32,048
battling mild cases of scoliosis
and advanced bed-wetting "the con"?

220
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:34,587
We can't get in there. The
tickets were sold out a month ago.

221
00:11:35,723 --> 00:11:38,054
Did you already try
to get tickets?

222
00:11:38,055 --> 00:11:39,989
Focus, Shawn.
How much were they?

223
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,584
Will you focus?

224
00:11:42,396 --> 00:11:44,761
No, no, no,
leave this out of sight

225
00:11:44,762 --> 00:11:47,163
until we get the issues resolved
with the food in his room, all right?

226
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,201
I don't know if he's going to
walk over the blueberry issue,

227
00:11:49,202 --> 00:11:52,328
but we cannot have people lining up
until we're sure he's participating.

228
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:56,171
I gotta call his agent. Get me a list
of all the produce vendors in the area.

229
00:11:56,172 --> 00:11:58,871
<i>We can't risk alienating
the Star Trek fans.</i>

230
00:12:00,547 --> 00:12:02,946
You can't come in
without tickets.

231
00:12:02,947 --> 00:12:05,074
They didn't tell you
we were coming?

232
00:12:05,075 --> 00:12:06,175
Who?

233
00:12:06,176 --> 00:12:08,153
We work for George.

234
00:12:11,558 --> 00:12:12,956
Takai?

235
00:12:12,957 --> 00:12:14,617
You mean Takei?

236
00:12:14,618 --> 00:12:18,494
Yeah. Those closest to him know exactly
how he likes it pronounced, okay?

237
00:12:18,495 --> 00:12:20,759
You think you can have a
convention without Commander Chekov?

238
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,993
Sulu, jackass.

239
00:12:21,994 --> 00:12:23,832
Have his fresh blueberries
arrived yet?

240
00:12:28,075 --> 00:12:30,133
I don't have record
of receiving them yet.

241
00:12:30,134 --> 00:12:32,972
You don't have record
of having received them yet.

242
00:12:32,973 --> 00:12:34,637
Give me that.

243
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,881
They don't have
the fresh blueberries.

244
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:45,955
What's the big deal?

245
00:12:45,956 --> 00:12:48,492
What's the big deal?
What is the big deal?

246
00:12:48,493 --> 00:12:50,687
Do you have any idea what happened
when they forgot his blueberries

247
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:52,320
at the con in San Antonio?

248
00:12:52,321 --> 00:12:54,127
That comb-over
will be the least of your...

249
00:12:56,035 --> 00:12:57,935
You know what,
it's better.

250
00:12:58,137 --> 00:13:00,036
It's better
if you don't know.

251
00:13:00,037 --> 00:13:03,471
It's how I ended up with a
stutter and a wooden pinky toe.

252
00:13:03,472 --> 00:13:05,442
Now for the love of Scotty...
Still Sulu.

253
00:13:05,443 --> 00:13:07,502
Would you...

254
00:13:08,414 --> 00:13:13,044
Please, let me get in there
and save all of our asses?

255
00:13:30,036 --> 00:13:32,560
Dude, some guy
in a wolf costume

256
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,399
with a light saber
just said hi to you.

257
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,904
I don't know that guy.

258
00:13:35,905 --> 00:13:37,440
He looked right at you.

259
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,873
He was mistaken.

260
00:13:38,874 --> 00:13:40,878
He said, "Hi, Gus."

261
00:13:41,146 --> 00:13:45,172
And then another dude with a cape
and a codpiece gave you a half-nod.

262
00:13:45,173 --> 00:13:47,444
I don't know any of these
people, Shawn, okay? Uh-huh.

263
00:13:47,445 --> 00:13:49,179
Hey, guys.
I'm Talia. This is Dent.

264
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,686
We're from Parastone Pictures

265
00:13:50,687 --> 00:13:53,416
and just wanted to remind you
to go see the world premiere

266
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:55,287
<i>of the Red Phantom
trailer tomorrow night.</i>

267
00:13:55,288 --> 00:13:57,850
It'll be the biggest movie of
the summer. Do not miss out.

268
00:13:57,851 --> 00:14:00,261
No way,
I love the dead phantom.

269
00:14:00,665 --> 00:14:02,189
Red Phantom.

270
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:05,466
What, he didn't die
at the end?

271
00:14:07,372 --> 00:14:08,998
Bye.
Bye.

272
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:10,631
I hear this movie's
going to bomb.

273
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:11,800
<i>Check one. Check two.</i>

274
00:14:11,801 --> 00:14:14,607
Too bad. I kind of dug
the Red Phantom.

275
00:14:14,913 --> 00:14:17,813
You haven't even seen the trailer, you
already hate it, how's that possible?

276
00:14:17,814 --> 00:14:19,816
<i>Fortress of Attitude.</i>

277
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,318
<i>What did you just say to me?
Fortress of Attitude.</i>

278
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,650
It's this site that reviews
movies based on comic books.

279
00:14:24,651 --> 00:14:26,417
The Malcontent,
the guy who runs it,

280
00:14:26,418 --> 00:14:29,288
says he already saw a 30-minute
presentation here at the convention.

281
00:14:29,289 --> 00:14:30,850
He blazed it online.

282
00:14:30,851 --> 00:14:33,829
Can't you just look at porn on the net
like every other guy and his brother?

283
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:34,922
Everybody reads this blog.

284
00:14:34,923 --> 00:14:37,058
No. Not everybody.

285
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:38,930
Everybody here does, Shawn.

286
00:14:38,931 --> 00:14:41,367
And you know what?
I don't care what you think.

287
00:14:41,368 --> 00:14:43,268
So why don't you let me do the
talking here at the convention,

288
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:44,670
and try not
to embarrass me.

289
00:14:44,671 --> 00:14:47,710
This is my turf. And yes, I
know the guy in the codpiece.

290
00:14:47,711 --> 00:14:49,574
His name is Dave.

291
00:14:49,575 --> 00:14:51,740
And he's a very nice guy.

292
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,213
Snap.

293
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,321
Two for 50 cents.

294
00:15:04,728 --> 00:15:06,787
What?
That's Hiltz Kooler.

295
00:15:09,433 --> 00:15:10,797
Excuse me, Mr. Kooler?

296
00:15:10,798 --> 00:15:12,630
I'm a huge Green Spirit fan.

297
00:15:12,631 --> 00:15:14,067
He's my favorite,
actually.

298
00:15:14,068 --> 00:15:15,195
I was wondering,

299
00:15:15,196 --> 00:15:17,296
would you mind signing
my original copy

300
00:15:17,297 --> 00:15:18,965
<i>of The Green Spirit
Strikes Again?</i>

301
00:15:18,966 --> 00:15:21,442
Whoa. Haven't seen
one of these in a while.

302
00:15:21,443 --> 00:15:23,274
I couldn't believe
I found a guy selling one.

303
00:15:23,275 --> 00:15:26,008
I love how this story reinvented
the character for today.

304
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,413
Well, there you go.

305
00:15:27,414 --> 00:15:29,348
Enjoy.
It's one of my favorites.

306
00:15:29,349 --> 00:15:31,785
You know, I wish they'd based
the movie on this story arc.

307
00:15:31,786 --> 00:15:33,981
What am I gonna do? I told
them about a million times.

308
00:15:33,982 --> 00:15:36,048
They don't listen to me.
Still a huge fan.

309
00:15:36,049 --> 00:15:38,821
Well, I'm glad someone is
after that Green Spirit movie.

310
00:15:38,822 --> 00:15:41,125
Wait, wait, wait. Is this
the movie you dragged me to

311
00:15:41,126 --> 00:15:44,393
where the hero had big nipples
on the outside of his costume?

312
00:15:44,394 --> 00:15:45,558
Damn those nipples.

313
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:48,535
They were like
big angry marshmallows.

314
00:15:48,536 --> 00:15:49,900
Be nice to him, Shawn.

315
00:15:49,901 --> 00:15:51,963
The Green Spirit movie
nearly killed the character.

316
00:15:51,964 --> 00:15:54,474
Gus, all I care about
is finding our guys.

317
00:15:54,475 --> 00:15:56,671
I can't take
much more of this.

318
00:15:58,247 --> 00:16:01,647
There's too much real estate.
We can't cover it all at once.

319
00:16:01,648 --> 00:16:02,979
Maybe we should split up.

320
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,111
I can help our situation.

321
00:16:06,622 --> 00:16:10,353
<i>So, next on our list...</i>

322
00:16:11,594 --> 00:16:12,890
<i>Sir, can I help you?</i>

323
00:16:12,891 --> 00:16:16,556
Yeah, I'm Shawn Spencer, psychic,
SBPD. I just need a moment.

324
00:16:16,557 --> 00:16:17,689
<i>Psychic?
Mmm-hmm.</i>

325
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:18,733
<i>Welcome.</i>

326
00:16:18,734 --> 00:16:21,234
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
science fiction fans,</i>

327
00:16:21,235 --> 00:16:23,601
<i>we've got a special treat
for you today,</i>

328
00:16:23,602 --> 00:16:26,106
<i>we have a psychic, a real
live professional psychic.</i>

329
00:16:26,107 --> 00:16:28,335
<i>Shawn, no.
Who's this?</i>

330
00:16:28,336 --> 00:16:31,175
This is my sidekick,

331
00:16:32,048 --> 00:16:33,447
Magic Head.

332
00:16:35,681 --> 00:16:38,345
You're a psychic?
Like Professor X?

333
00:16:38,346 --> 00:16:40,251
Professor X is a telepath,
not a psychic.

334
00:16:40,252 --> 00:16:42,916
But I do have
telepathic tendencies.

335
00:16:42,917 --> 00:16:45,186
No, you don't. You have psychic
visions. They're different.

336
00:16:45,187 --> 00:16:47,921
No, really, I can do both.
No, you can't.

337
00:16:47,922 --> 00:16:49,793
Can you read me?
Sure.

338
00:16:56,405 --> 00:16:59,168
I'm getting a reading. I'm
getting a reading right now, yes.

339
00:16:59,169 --> 00:17:03,644
You spend a great deal of
time in front of your computer.

340
00:17:07,077 --> 00:17:09,742
And, I see a girl.
Yes.

341
00:17:09,743 --> 00:17:12,411
You like her from afar.

342
00:17:12,412 --> 00:17:14,420
She doesn't really
know you exist.

343
00:17:14,421 --> 00:17:17,390
Yes. Yes.
Her name's Megan.

344
00:17:18,093 --> 00:17:19,856
Do I have a chance?

345
00:17:21,263 --> 00:17:23,492
Don't put
too much work into it.

346
00:17:23,493 --> 00:17:27,057
I think she might
want to be "just friends."

347
00:17:27,702 --> 00:17:29,134
Shawn, we're supposed to be
looking for Malone.

348
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:31,103
Obviously Malone
is keeping a low profile.

349
00:17:31,104 --> 00:17:35,040
Whoa! Boy, I'm getting...
Whoa! I'm getting an "R."

350
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,872
I am getting an "R."

351
00:17:36,873 --> 00:17:39,970
Does anyone here have a name
that begins with "R"?

352
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:43,448
Oh, wait a second...
Hold, nobody... and a "D."

353
00:17:43,449 --> 00:17:46,008
Yes a "D."
An "R" and a "D."

354
00:17:46,009 --> 00:17:50,547
An "R" name... Rim... Rolph...

355
00:17:50,548 --> 00:17:53,592
Robert... No "bert,"
just Rob.

356
00:17:53,593 --> 00:17:55,423
Rob. And a "D" name, yes.

357
00:17:55,424 --> 00:17:57,963
Uh, Dan. Uh, Doodle.

358
00:17:57,964 --> 00:18:00,158
Dook... Dook...
Dookie...

359
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:03,031
Duder... Dumb...
Don! Yes!

360
00:18:03,032 --> 00:18:04,730
Rob and a Don.

361
00:18:04,731 --> 00:18:06,170
That's us!

362
00:18:08,231 --> 00:18:10,208
An actual
Rob and Don together.

363
00:18:10,209 --> 00:18:13,212
Sometimes I scare myself.

364
00:18:21,255 --> 00:18:24,816
Hey, fellas, first I need you
both to empty your pockets.

365
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,352
Mmm... Oh!

366
00:18:29,763 --> 00:18:32,356
A room key. Even though
you both reside locally.

367
00:18:32,357 --> 00:18:35,196
Oh, our friend sprang
for a hotel suite for us.

368
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,497
Ah, room 129.

369
00:18:37,037 --> 00:18:38,060
<i>428.</i>

370
00:18:38,061 --> 00:18:40,538
Yes, of course.
I'm getting something.

371
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:43,508
This friend you speak of, I sense
you haven't seen him for a while,

372
00:18:43,509 --> 00:18:45,544
but you didn't
tell anyone, no.

373
00:18:45,545 --> 00:18:47,546
You're not supposed
to be here.

374
00:18:47,547 --> 00:18:51,574
You told your parents you
were going to computer camp.

375
00:18:52,186 --> 00:18:54,677
Computer camp, guys?
Really?

376
00:18:55,588 --> 00:18:57,715
I know what you're hiding.

377
00:18:59,492 --> 00:19:00,924
We're not going
after them?

378
00:19:00,925 --> 00:19:02,984
What for?
Malone's not with them.

379
00:19:02,985 --> 00:19:05,461
But I think I know
where he might be.

380
00:19:05,462 --> 00:19:08,762
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Shawn Spencer and Magic Head.</i>

381
00:19:08,763 --> 00:19:10,131
<i>Let's check out room 428.</i>

382
00:19:10,132 --> 00:19:13,730
Well, they seemed pretty
convincing. That's them there!

383
00:19:14,674 --> 00:19:17,336
Why are you telling people
you're my assistants?

384
00:19:18,978 --> 00:19:21,173
Because we are
your assistants.

385
00:19:21,814 --> 00:19:24,374
Excuse me? Are you
serious, George?

386
00:19:25,778 --> 00:19:28,012
I know we said we'd work
outside the loop,

387
00:19:28,013 --> 00:19:29,781
but this is
a little ridiculous.

388
00:19:29,782 --> 00:19:31,254
I don't recognize you.

389
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:32,756
You hired us personally.

390
00:19:32,757 --> 00:19:35,884
We met you in Chicago at a screening
of that movie with the whales.

391
00:19:35,885 --> 00:19:37,656
<i>Star Trek IV:
The Voyage Home.</i>

392
00:19:37,657 --> 00:19:41,825
The last time I was in Chicago, I was
doing a reading from my autobiography.

393
00:19:41,826 --> 00:19:43,766
Right. We booked that.

394
00:19:44,137 --> 00:19:47,333
Remember Robin told us he'd never
be able to fill a room that size?

395
00:19:47,334 --> 00:19:48,430
Yeah.

396
00:19:48,431 --> 00:19:49,974
I don't know any Robin.

397
00:19:49,975 --> 00:19:51,407
That's because I fired her.

398
00:19:51,408 --> 00:19:53,876
Look, George, you don't need
that kind of negativity, okay?

399
00:19:53,877 --> 00:19:56,039
It's her fault what
happened in San Antonio.

400
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,639
Though you didn't
hear that from me.

401
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,216
I'm very confused.

402
00:20:00,217 --> 00:20:02,343
Look, George, we can stand
around and talk all day...

403
00:20:02,344 --> 00:20:03,444
Like Robin used to.

404
00:20:03,445 --> 00:20:06,354
Or I can try to do something about
solving your blueberry crisis.

405
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:08,188
The choice is yours.

406
00:20:08,493 --> 00:20:11,222
Well, all right, then.
Get to it.

407
00:20:11,223 --> 00:20:12,763
Thank you.

408
00:20:13,131 --> 00:20:14,564
Thank you.

409
00:20:17,035 --> 00:20:19,196
Ew!
Gosh.

410
00:20:19,605 --> 00:20:21,401
I see why Rob
and Don were freaked.

411
00:20:21,402 --> 00:20:23,463
They didn't want to be held
responsible for this mess.

412
00:20:23,464 --> 00:20:25,476
This place is trashed.

413
00:20:26,144 --> 00:20:27,634
Maybe Johnny Depp
stopped by.

414
00:20:29,948 --> 00:20:33,348
I'm sorry, did that joke just
arrive in a time machine from 1992?

415
00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:35,749
He used to trash
hotel rooms. Used to.

416
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,720
The man has kids now.
He lives in France.

417
00:20:37,721 --> 00:20:39,153
You got a better version?
Of course I do.

418
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,487
How about that lame-o
who's dating Kate Moss?

419
00:20:41,488 --> 00:20:43,186
He's British and
nobody knows who he is.

420
00:20:43,187 --> 00:20:44,922
Okay, fine. Too inside.

421
00:20:44,923 --> 00:20:47,158
Stephen Dorff.
Always solid.

422
00:20:49,468 --> 00:20:52,631
Dude, come here.

423
00:20:57,643 --> 00:20:59,736
Why would this kid
have these mock-ups?

424
00:21:05,316 --> 00:21:08,046
Because I think our missing
person has a secret identity.

425
00:21:08,753 --> 00:21:12,086
By day, he's a laptop-toting,
comic-loving virgin.

426
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:13,888
At night,

427
00:21:14,292 --> 00:21:15,849
he's your
favorite blogger.

428
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,586
You think
The Malcontent is a kid?

429
00:21:17,587 --> 00:21:21,154
He must have pissed off the
wrong people with his blog.

430
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,861
Shawn, look.

431
00:21:23,862 --> 00:21:27,028
"One down, two to go."
Hmm.

432
00:21:27,872 --> 00:21:29,931
There goes the
kid-on-a-spending-spree theory.

433
00:21:32,743 --> 00:21:34,210
Keith Moon.

434
00:21:43,688 --> 00:21:45,518
I just went over the posts
on Malone's blog.

435
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:47,112
Did he bash anything
in particular?

436
00:21:47,113 --> 00:21:49,283
<i>The Red Phantom movie.
He's relentless.</i>

437
00:21:49,284 --> 00:21:50,986
It's weird, because
if you go back a little,

438
00:21:50,987 --> 00:21:53,120
he was originally saying
great things about it.

439
00:21:53,121 --> 00:21:57,530
<i>So Parastone Pictures paid him
to praise the Red Phantom flick.</i>

440
00:21:57,531 --> 00:21:59,431
That must be where all the
money from his room came from.

441
00:21:59,432 --> 00:22:00,560
Makes sense.

442
00:22:00,561 --> 00:22:02,127
Malone's blog
started the bad buzz

443
00:22:02,128 --> 00:22:04,196
which sunk Parastone's
last comic book movie.

444
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,538
I don't think the nipples
helped either, Gus. Well, yeah.

445
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:09,236
So the studio had everything
riding on this new film.

446
00:22:09,237 --> 00:22:11,643
They would have done anything to
prevent history from repeating itself.

447
00:22:11,644 --> 00:22:13,409
<i>But Malone blazed
The Red Phantom anyway.</i>

448
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,279
He reneged, which might
be why he's missing.

449
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,784
We need to
find those execs.

450
00:22:16,785 --> 00:22:18,513
Hey. Any progress?

451
00:22:18,514 --> 00:22:21,022
I picked up
Malone's astral trail.

452
00:22:21,558 --> 00:22:23,582
That's what it's called.

453
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:26,526
It leads to a hotel across
from the convention center.

454
00:22:26,527 --> 00:22:28,563
<i>Room 428.
Oak door, can't miss it.</i>

455
00:22:28,564 --> 00:22:30,393
That's more specific
than usual.

456
00:22:30,394 --> 00:22:32,991
Sometimes the spirits
are in a giving mood.

457
00:22:32,992 --> 00:22:34,057
You won't find Malone,

458
00:22:34,058 --> 00:22:36,434
but I sense
some seriously dark

459
00:22:36,435 --> 00:22:38,132
juju magumbo
went down in there.

460
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:41,301
Yeah, send some uniforms to the hotel
across from the convention center

461
00:22:41,302 --> 00:22:43,971
<i>and tell them to
cordon off room 428.</i>

462
00:22:43,972 --> 00:22:45,275
Good.

463
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:48,242
This had better
be for real.

464
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:50,684
So, how's the convention?

465
00:22:50,685 --> 00:22:52,448
A lot of cool stuff
going on, I bet.

466
00:22:52,449 --> 00:22:53,818
Oh, come on.
Not you, too.

467
00:22:53,819 --> 00:22:55,618
You're a collector, too?
Since middle school.

468
00:22:55,619 --> 00:22:57,124
I just got
Hiltz Kooler's autograph.

469
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,989
Shut up, you did not?
Yes, I did.

470
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,722
Hi. Missing kid,
worried mom.

471
00:23:00,723 --> 00:23:02,388
Can we focus here?

472
00:23:02,389 --> 00:23:03,761
Since when did you
get so structured?

473
00:23:03,762 --> 00:23:05,595
Since you turned
into Urkel

474
00:23:05,596 --> 00:23:07,932
And you just became

475
00:23:08,505 --> 00:23:10,529
Jan Brady...

476
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,129
Wow.
Tina Yothers...

477
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:16,075
There's... There's not
an exact match for that.

478
00:23:16,445 --> 00:23:19,436
You didn't want to tell her about our
suspicions with the Parastone executives?

479
00:23:19,437 --> 00:23:22,678
Please, Gus, we have to leave
something to divine later.

480
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,582
Yeah. This is nice.

481
00:23:26,555 --> 00:23:28,887
It's good one-on-one time.

482
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,623
Let the guard down.

483
00:23:32,761 --> 00:23:34,557
You know, I had an idea
not too long ago,

484
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:36,460
and it's funny
I should think of it now,

485
00:23:36,461 --> 00:23:39,625
but it really doesn't make any
sense to have so many officers

486
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:41,497
working the daytime shift
at Grab.

487
00:23:41,498 --> 00:23:43,594
Detective. Since most car
thefts occur at night.

488
00:23:43,595 --> 00:23:45,866
Now, if you were to split the
shift, go with me on this...

489
00:23:45,867 --> 00:23:47,407
Carlton!
What?

490
00:23:47,408 --> 00:23:49,273
My water just broke.

491
00:23:49,778 --> 00:23:50,835
Are you sure?

492
00:23:50,836 --> 00:23:54,075
No, Carlton, there's water spilling
out of me for some other reason.

493
00:23:54,076 --> 00:23:57,174
Oh, no. Oh, can you
move my briefcase?

494
00:23:57,175 --> 00:23:59,082
Your briefcase? It might
be in the line of the...

495
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:01,212
Do you understand
how uncomfortable this is?

496
00:24:01,213 --> 00:24:03,382
It's leather.
I didn't Scotchguard it!

497
00:24:03,383 --> 00:24:06,155
You know what, never mind.

498
00:24:06,495 --> 00:24:08,519
Just has tremendous
sentimental value.

499
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,088
Just take me to the nearest
hospital. All right?

500
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:15,062
Oh, I don't think we need
that. Oh, I think we do.

501
00:24:15,063 --> 00:24:19,696
Do you know what? We'll use the
siren, too. For you. Just in case.

502
00:24:26,247 --> 00:24:27,508
Hey, guys.
Hey.

503
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:30,483
Can't stop to talk.
Got to sign autographs.

504
00:24:30,785 --> 00:24:34,015
Look, dude, I got a date with that Talia
girl from the studio in, like, an hour.

505
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:36,146
A nice romantic walk
on the beach to Jim's.

506
00:24:36,147 --> 00:24:37,850
Best scungilli in
Santa Barbara.

507
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,414
Why couldn't you
just talk to her now?

508
00:24:39,415 --> 00:24:41,859
Because, Gus, happy hour
doesn't start until 5:00.

509
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,327
You're supposed to be
figuring out if she's innocent.

510
00:24:43,328 --> 00:24:45,058
That's exactly
what I plan to do.

511
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,494
Shawn.
GT.

512
00:24:47,495 --> 00:24:49,467
The blueberries
are still wrong.

513
00:24:49,468 --> 00:24:54,940
I requested North Carolina blueberries,
but they sent me Michigan blueberries.

514
00:24:54,941 --> 00:24:58,739
People say I'm crazy, but
I can taste the difference.

515
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,109
I don't think
that's crazy at all.

516
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:05,175
And I requested that my green
room not be at the end of the hall.

517
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,879
I have to be in the middle.
It's affecting my chi.

518
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,650
Gus.
What?

519
00:25:10,651 --> 00:25:12,783
Did you skimp out and get
the Michigan blueberries?

520
00:25:12,784 --> 00:25:14,486
What? And screw up
the room location?

521
00:25:14,487 --> 00:25:15,721
And what are you doing
to George's chi?

522
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:18,093
Are you touching it
and whatnot? Stop it.

523
00:25:18,094 --> 00:25:19,790
This is my fault,
Mr. Takei.

524
00:25:19,791 --> 00:25:21,594
My fault for farming out
responsibilities

525
00:25:21,595 --> 00:25:23,532
that I should have
seen to personally.

526
00:25:23,533 --> 00:25:24,694
My humblest apologies.

527
00:25:24,695 --> 00:25:26,635
We'll get you the right
blueberries as soon as possible

528
00:25:26,636 --> 00:25:29,173
and a better room assignment.
You have my word.

529
00:25:29,174 --> 00:25:31,301
Well, all right, then.

530
00:25:32,045 --> 00:25:34,741
Good help is hard to find,
I suppose.

531
00:25:37,784 --> 00:25:39,011
Why did you blame
that on me?

532
00:25:39,012 --> 00:25:40,312
Dude, we needed
a fall guy.

533
00:25:40,313 --> 00:25:42,877
I can't be the fall guy in front
of one of my heroes, Shawn.

534
00:25:42,878 --> 00:25:45,685
Okay, then you and I need to
create a third imaginary assistant

535
00:25:45,686 --> 00:25:47,191
that's completely
incompetent.

536
00:25:47,192 --> 00:25:49,523
I think her name
should be Beatrice.

537
00:25:49,524 --> 00:25:51,257
What say you?

538
00:25:53,033 --> 00:25:56,025
All right, yeah,
just send it to my assistant.

539
00:25:56,303 --> 00:25:57,964
It's tremendous.

540
00:25:58,338 --> 00:26:01,135
You don't mind it, though. You
don't mind all the comic book stuff?

541
00:26:01,136 --> 00:26:04,267
It's fun, harmless,
a little wish fulfillment.

542
00:26:04,978 --> 00:26:07,309
Oh, come on, you didn't pretend
to fly around like Superman

543
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,143
when you were a kid?

544
00:26:10,617 --> 00:26:13,585
<i>So, uh, pretty high stakes
on the Red Phantom movie, huh?</i>

545
00:26:13,586 --> 00:26:16,952
We, uh, took a bath a couple of years
ago on this other comic book movie,

546
00:26:17,223 --> 00:26:19,053
<i>The Adventures
of the Green Spirit.</i>

547
00:26:19,054 --> 00:26:20,455
Yeah, the nipple flick.

548
00:26:20,456 --> 00:26:23,188
God, is that all anyone
remembers about that movie? Yes.

549
00:26:23,189 --> 00:26:27,027
Ugh, we had to build a landfill
for the unsold action figures.

550
00:26:27,028 --> 00:26:29,032
So, we're pulling out
all the stops

551
00:26:29,033 --> 00:26:31,432
<i>to launch the trailer
for the Red Phantom movie.</i>

552
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:33,470
You know, lasers, music.

553
00:26:33,471 --> 00:26:36,905
Dent even organized this
whole pyrotechnics display.

554
00:26:36,906 --> 00:26:40,342
Word of mouth is the first and
most vital step in this world.

555
00:26:40,343 --> 00:26:42,402
Vital enough
to pay somebody off?

556
00:26:42,403 --> 00:26:43,504
What?

557
00:26:43,505 --> 00:26:46,175
Hmm? Let's say there's
a blogger, right?

558
00:26:46,176 --> 00:26:48,514
And he's wielding way
more power than he should.

559
00:26:48,515 --> 00:26:50,144
And he can be had
for a price.

560
00:26:50,145 --> 00:26:52,485
You guys would be fools
not to take a shot, right?

561
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:53,649
Who are you, Shawn?

562
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:55,852
I'm a psychic.
I work with the police.

563
00:26:55,853 --> 00:26:57,758
I'm investigating
a disappearance.

564
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:00,822
Malone Breyfogle.
The Malcontent.

565
00:27:01,233 --> 00:27:03,723
I'm sensing you probably
know a lot about him.

566
00:27:03,724 --> 00:27:05,462
Okay, this conversation
is over.

567
00:27:05,463 --> 00:27:07,163
No. It's just starting
to get good.

568
00:27:07,164 --> 00:27:09,798
See, he reneged on a promise
and now he's missing.

569
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:11,103
Missing?

570
00:27:11,877 --> 00:27:15,505
Look, whether or not this guy had a
consultation fee is besides the point.

571
00:27:15,506 --> 00:27:17,571
We don't harm people.
It's just a movie.

572
00:27:17,572 --> 00:27:19,413
Just a movie?

573
00:27:19,852 --> 00:27:21,751
You think your boss
will tell me the same thing?

574
00:27:21,752 --> 00:27:23,844
I don't know. Why don't
we go ask him together?

575
00:27:23,845 --> 00:27:25,980
Dent is back at our
convention headquarters.

576
00:27:25,981 --> 00:27:29,390
Fine.
So, no scungilli, then?

577
00:27:32,897 --> 00:27:34,625
I didn't expect you
to be so cooperative,

578
00:27:34,626 --> 00:27:35,926
so if I seemed
a little pushy...

579
00:27:35,927 --> 00:27:37,466
Accusing me of kidnapping?

580
00:27:37,467 --> 00:27:39,161
I accused you of bribery.

581
00:27:39,162 --> 00:27:41,534
I implied you may have had
something to do with the kidnapping.

582
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:42,799
There's a difference.

583
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,704
You know, a lot of couples
start off on the wrong foot.

584
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,242
It just means we have
nowhere to go but up.

585
00:27:46,243 --> 00:27:49,541
Well, when you're done here
with Dent, we're done.

586
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,243
What the...

587
00:27:53,244 --> 00:27:56,514
Oh, my God. What happened
here? Where is he?

588
00:27:59,557 --> 00:28:03,015
Some seriously dark juju
magumbo went down in here.

589
00:28:07,465 --> 00:28:09,365
"Two down, one to go."

590
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:13,166
Okay, good news,
your boss is innocent.

591
00:28:13,838 --> 00:28:17,239
Bad news, he just became
a face on a milk carton.

592
00:28:23,715 --> 00:28:25,443
I checked Malone's blog
again today.

593
00:28:25,444 --> 00:28:27,710
<i>There are more entries
blazing the Red Phantom movie.</i>

594
00:28:27,711 --> 00:28:30,048
I think Malone was kidnapped
before the blogs showed up.

595
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:32,280
He was probably going to honor
his deal with Parastone.

596
00:28:32,281 --> 00:28:35,346
So, the kidnapper is the one
roasting this new movie online?

597
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:38,188
He also wrote,
"The guilty will pay."

598
00:28:38,189 --> 00:28:39,827
The guilty will pay?

599
00:28:39,828 --> 00:28:41,192
Yep.
Wow.

600
00:28:41,193 --> 00:28:43,754
One of these comic book freaks
has clearly blurred the line

601
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:45,927
between reality and

602
00:28:47,871 --> 00:28:48,860
comic book.

603
00:28:49,406 --> 00:28:52,272
The kidnapper still has
one more person to snatch.

604
00:28:52,273 --> 00:28:55,071
And it appears he's targeting
anyone involved in this bribery scam.

605
00:28:55,072 --> 00:28:57,977
Talia.
Talia has to be the next victim.

606
00:28:57,978 --> 00:28:59,537
We need to get
the real police in here.

607
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:02,982
Hello? Uh, hello, Mr.
Takei, what can I do for you?

608
00:29:02,983 --> 00:29:04,610
Just name it.

609
00:29:05,856 --> 00:29:07,847
Hold on.
It's for you.

610
00:29:09,025 --> 00:29:12,893
G-Dog. What's up, handsome?
Beatrice?

611
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:16,794
I canned her.
Yeah, she's out of here.

612
00:29:17,367 --> 00:29:20,700
Tonight? Absolutely, sir.
I'll meet you there.

613
00:29:21,404 --> 00:29:23,462
Huh.
What? What's happening?

614
00:29:23,463 --> 00:29:24,904
Karaoke with George later.

615
00:29:24,905 --> 00:29:26,407
Get out of here.

616
00:29:26,408 --> 00:29:28,500
<i>This is a Trek fan's
dream come true.</i>

617
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:30,340
Hmm. Awkward.

618
00:29:30,341 --> 00:29:32,540
What?
He sort of just invited me.

619
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,741
You know what?
Call him back,

620
00:29:34,742 --> 00:29:38,650
tell him I said we need you
for all the high harmonies.

621
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,153
This is messed up, Shawn.

622
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:41,813
No, this is messed up.

623
00:29:41,814 --> 00:29:45,258
This isn't a churro. This is...
I don't know what this is.

624
00:29:48,664 --> 00:29:49,891
Okay, finally got a hold
of your husband.

625
00:29:49,892 --> 00:29:52,432
He's on his way, but apparently
traffic is a nightmare.

626
00:29:52,433 --> 00:29:53,489
Thank you, Carlton.

627
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,559
Everything's looking
really good.

628
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,367
You just relax.

629
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,603
I'm going to go now
and let you...

630
00:30:00,604 --> 00:30:03,576
No, wait. Wait, wait,
wait. Don't... Don't go.

631
00:30:03,577 --> 00:30:05,408
You want me to stay?

632
00:30:05,409 --> 00:30:08,143
Yeah. In class,
I always had a coach.

633
00:30:09,018 --> 00:30:12,145
So, just stand here and keep
your eyes north of the equator.

634
00:30:12,146 --> 00:30:13,414
Yeah, that won't be a problem.

635
00:30:13,415 --> 00:30:15,285
You ready
for your epidural?

636
00:30:15,286 --> 00:30:18,223
No, thank you. I'm going
to do this naturally.

637
00:30:18,224 --> 00:30:20,818
Okay. We'll hold off, then.
Mmm-hmm.

638
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,863
Are you insane?
I don't need it.

639
00:30:22,864 --> 00:30:25,092
Listen, I would put myself
on a morphine pump

640
00:30:25,093 --> 00:30:27,259
if I were going to push eleven
pounds of limbs and elbows out of...

641
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,270
I've made my decision.

642
00:30:30,773 --> 00:30:32,330
And I admire you for it.

643
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:35,467
Have you considered this? Maybe
the whole thing is a stunt.

644
00:30:35,468 --> 00:30:38,034
What do you mean? You
know, to promote the movie.

645
00:30:38,035 --> 00:30:40,342
The whole scenario
is just so fantastical.

646
00:30:40,343 --> 00:30:42,382
It's like a plot
to a comic book.

647
00:30:42,383 --> 00:30:44,007
Dent could have arranged it,
maybe Talia.

648
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,108
It could have been
all three of them.

649
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:48,245
It's just so theatrical
with the cryptic notes.

650
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:49,789
Shawn?
Hi.

651
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:52,417
Hi. Gus said
you've seen the kidnapper.

652
00:30:52,418 --> 00:30:54,084
You told her that?
We needed her.

653
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:55,389
Can you give me
a description?

654
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:58,727
You can't tell her I've seen the
kidnapper when I didn't see the kidnapper.

655
00:30:58,728 --> 00:31:00,960
I didn't see the kidnapper.
You didn't?

656
00:31:00,961 --> 00:31:04,971
I saw through
the kidnapper's eyes.

657
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,565
He was stalking his next
victim. It was a woman.

658
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:15,071
Shawn.

659
00:31:16,684 --> 00:31:18,082
Talia. It's Talia.

660
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:21,609
Wait. The woman you discovered the
second note with is the third victim?

661
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:24,555
Quite possibly.
Or she could be the kidnapper.

662
00:31:24,556 --> 00:31:25,683
So, what,
she's kidnapping herself?

663
00:31:25,684 --> 00:31:27,021
Or the second victim
is the kidnapper

664
00:31:27,022 --> 00:31:28,459
and he was just pretending
to get kidnapped.

665
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,655
Guys, I just saw her.
She's outside on the phone.

666
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:32,063
Man.

667
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:38,967
Where did you see her last?
Over there.

668
00:31:38,968 --> 00:31:40,439
Oh, man.

669
00:31:43,511 --> 00:31:45,137
"9-1..." Uh-oh.

670
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,170
What? No note?

671
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,207
Wait a minute.

672
00:31:54,087 --> 00:31:55,486
Excuse me.

673
00:31:59,326 --> 00:32:00,725
Thank you.

674
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,221
"Judgment day."

675
00:32:05,933 --> 00:32:10,267
Looks like Talia's joined Malone
and Dent in missing-persons land.

676
00:32:16,777 --> 00:32:19,678
Judgment day?
It sounds bad.

677
00:32:20,447 --> 00:32:23,279
That's, like, the day
that you're judged.

678
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,408
<i>In T2 it was
the end of mankind.</i>

679
00:32:25,409 --> 00:32:28,043
Though I doubt our kidnapper has
first-strike nuclear capabilities.

680
00:32:28,044 --> 00:32:29,452
Ooh!

681
00:32:33,026 --> 00:32:34,583
What the hell
are you doing?

682
00:32:34,584 --> 00:32:36,651
Running makes me hungry.
You know that.

683
00:32:36,652 --> 00:32:37,991
You don't know
where those have been.

684
00:32:37,992 --> 00:32:39,622
They could have bird flu
on them or something.

685
00:32:39,623 --> 00:32:41,667
Bird flu. Wow.
Look at you.

686
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,759
How can you read a comic book
at a time like this?

687
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,531
First of all,
I can read a comic anytime.

688
00:32:45,532 --> 00:32:48,471
And secondly, Juliet has almost the
entire police force inside there.

689
00:32:48,472 --> 00:32:49,564
They'll find Talia
and the others.

690
00:32:49,565 --> 00:32:52,132
Dude, whatever this crazy person
has planned for these people,

691
00:32:52,133 --> 00:32:53,507
he's going to do it soon.

692
00:32:53,508 --> 00:32:55,478
He has all his victims.

693
00:32:55,479 --> 00:32:57,071
We need to figure out
who stands to gain

694
00:32:57,072 --> 00:32:58,581
from the disappearance
of those three

695
00:32:58,582 --> 00:33:01,517
<i>and who would want the Red
Phantom movie to tank this badly.</i>

696
00:33:01,518 --> 00:33:03,213
Why don't you ask your friend,
George Takei?

697
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:04,414
I would.

698
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:07,788
<i>But once he starts singing Afternoon
Delight, he just goes to another place.</i>

699
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:09,190
Shawn?

700
00:33:09,191 --> 00:33:11,421
Juliet didn't find anything at
the latest crime scene to help?

701
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:12,827
Shawn?
No forensics on the note?

702
00:33:12,828 --> 00:33:13,921
Shawn?
What?

703
00:33:13,922 --> 00:33:17,059
Look. It's the same
as the note in Malone's room.

704
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,898
Somebody's recreating the
crime from this comic book.

705
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:20,403
What happens
in this thing?

706
00:33:20,404 --> 00:33:21,962
A supervillain named
Fear Career,

707
00:33:21,963 --> 00:33:23,940
he kidnaps the judge,
prosecutor and defense attorney

708
00:33:23,941 --> 00:33:25,203
he felt
locked him up years ago.

709
00:33:25,204 --> 00:33:27,677
Fear Career. Awesome.
Then what?

710
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,307
He sets them on fire.

711
00:33:29,308 --> 00:33:31,576
He sets them on fire?
Yeah.

712
00:33:31,577 --> 00:33:32,946
Give me that.
What the hell are you doing?

713
00:33:32,947 --> 00:33:34,007
Looking for clues.

714
00:33:34,008 --> 00:33:36,076
You're ruining a first
printing near-mint work of art.

715
00:33:36,077 --> 00:33:37,746
I've been looking for that
comic for five years now.

716
00:33:37,747 --> 00:33:40,018
Gus, lives are at stake.

717
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,454
The kidnapper must be
some kind of deranged fan.

718
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:48,363
Deranged? Yes. Fan?

719
00:33:49,702 --> 00:33:51,066
I'm not so sure.

720
00:33:51,067 --> 00:33:53,969
Wait, what?
What the...

721
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,438
You're buying me another one.
First printing!

722
00:34:01,277 --> 00:34:04,405
She's not focusing. Can you
help motivate her a little bit?

723
00:34:04,406 --> 00:34:08,042
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Motivation
was my thing at the academy.

724
00:34:08,043 --> 00:34:09,745
All right,
now you listen to me,

725
00:34:09,746 --> 00:34:10,878
it's time to squeeze
this puppy out.

726
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,683
So, when I say push, I want
you to push, you understand me?

727
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:15,452
Push! Push! Push!

728
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:17,721
Yeah, that's not really
working for me right now!

729
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,230
Fine, I was just
giving it a shot!

730
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:24,931
Um, okay, okay.

731
00:34:24,932 --> 00:34:27,528
Just, just remain calm.

732
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:30,131
Everything's going to be fine.

733
00:34:30,132 --> 00:34:32,641
Uh, yeah.
I don't need that either.

734
00:34:32,642 --> 00:34:34,438
I don't know
what you want then.

735
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:36,138
I don't know
what any woman wants.

736
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:38,807
Just give me your hand
and shut the hell up.

737
00:34:38,808 --> 00:34:43,820
It's crowning. Here we go.
Here we go.

738
00:34:45,957 --> 00:34:47,356
It's a girl.

739
00:34:50,762 --> 00:34:52,229
We did it.

740
00:34:53,064 --> 00:34:54,428
Want to cut the cord, Dad?

741
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:57,524
No, I'm not the...
Yeah, okay.

742
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,707
Oh, oh, you're going to...
Oh!

743
00:35:07,644 --> 00:35:09,271
Hi, there.

744
00:35:09,513 --> 00:35:11,140
Nice to meet you.

745
00:35:12,649 --> 00:35:15,947
Children are one of the
reasons my wife and I split up.

746
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:18,351
She didn't think
I wanted any.

747
00:35:19,056 --> 00:35:20,648
She was wrong.

748
00:35:21,091 --> 00:35:23,252
Yeah, that's great, Carlton.

749
00:35:24,695 --> 00:35:27,220
You think I might
hold my baby now?

750
00:35:31,535 --> 00:35:32,661
Of course.

751
00:35:33,403 --> 00:35:34,801
We need to find Juliet fast.

752
00:35:34,802 --> 00:35:36,634
She's in plain clothes. She
could be anywhere in this place.

753
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:39,106
It's like looking for
a needle in a haystack.

754
00:35:39,107 --> 00:35:41,075
I know how
I can get her attention.

755
00:35:41,076 --> 00:35:42,668
Shawn!
Will you stop going up there?

756
00:35:42,669 --> 00:35:45,214
Sorry. Judgment day.
Got to do it.

757
00:35:45,782 --> 00:35:50,549
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
George... Uh, okay, okay.</i>

758
00:35:51,255 --> 00:35:54,747
<i>Please welcome back to the
stage psychic Shawn Spencer!</i>

759
00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:04,998
<i>I'm sensing something.
Something strong.</i>

760
00:36:04,999 --> 00:36:08,001
<i>A spirit. A disturbed spirit.</i>

761
00:36:08,002 --> 00:36:10,060
Why is my assistant up there?

762
00:36:10,061 --> 00:36:13,232
Maybe he's setting up a karaoke
machine for your duet, Chekov.

763
00:36:13,233 --> 00:36:14,901
Sulu, damn it!

764
00:36:15,144 --> 00:36:16,667
<i>It's getting clear now.</i>

765
00:36:16,668 --> 00:36:18,736
<i>It's a kidnapping spirit</i>

766
00:36:18,737 --> 00:36:22,750
<i>responsible for crimes
committed right here at the con!</i>

767
00:36:23,085 --> 00:36:24,746
<i>I need help.</i>

768
00:36:24,954 --> 00:36:30,085
<i>I must call upon the powers
of Magic Head!</i>

769
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:35,258
Magic Head! Magic Head! Magic
Head! Magic Head! Magic Head!

770
00:36:38,301 --> 00:36:40,292
Who's Magic Head?

771
00:36:43,372 --> 00:36:45,363
Where are you going?

772
00:37:02,124 --> 00:37:03,647
<i>I can see it now.</i>

773
00:37:03,648 --> 00:37:05,624
<i>It is a vengeful spirit
and there is a color.</i>

774
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:08,423
<i>The color is green.
It is the Green Spirit.</i>

775
00:37:08,424 --> 00:37:12,660
<i>The kidnapper is the creator
of The Green Spirit,</i>

776
00:37:14,603 --> 00:37:16,366
<i>Hiltz Kooler.</i>

777
00:37:20,141 --> 00:37:22,165
<i>Ah, yes, you had motive,
didn't you?</i>

778
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:25,144
<i>The studio execs bastardized
your beloved Green Spirit</i>

779
00:37:25,145 --> 00:37:27,772
<i>and turned him into
a pop culture punch line.</i>

780
00:37:27,773 --> 00:37:29,645
<i>You hated Malone,
The Malcontent,</i>

781
00:37:29,646 --> 00:37:32,550
<i>because it was his tidal wave
of bad buzz that sunk your flick.</i>

782
00:37:32,551 --> 00:37:36,853
<i>You were on the brink of becoming
a mogul. But then it all slipped away.</i>

783
00:37:37,192 --> 00:37:38,818
<i>Now you're reduced
to cursing nipples</i>

784
00:37:38,819 --> 00:37:40,553
<i>and signing autographs
at conventions.</i>

785
00:37:40,554 --> 00:37:44,759
<i>Like a classic supervillain,
you were driven mad by revenge.</i>

786
00:37:45,567 --> 00:37:49,502
<i>You read Malone's blogs, looking
for clues to his true identity.</i>

787
00:37:49,503 --> 00:37:52,596
<i>Then, one day,
like manna from heaven,</i>

788
00:37:52,597 --> 00:37:55,267
<i>The Malcontent blogged
he was coming here.</i>

789
00:37:55,268 --> 00:37:58,800
<i>You also read the execs who had
screwed your character would be here, too.</i>

790
00:37:58,801 --> 00:38:02,110
<i>All the people that wronged you
in the same place at the same time.</i>

791
00:38:02,111 --> 00:38:05,276
<i>The opportunity was too good
to pass up.</i>

792
00:38:05,277 --> 00:38:08,856
<i>And you could hide your
identity by wearing a costume.</i>

793
00:38:10,991 --> 00:38:13,982
<i>And every time you snatched
one of your victims,</i>

794
00:38:13,983 --> 00:38:19,556
<i>you left a note just like
Fear Career in your comic.</i>

795
00:38:20,501 --> 00:38:21,900
<i>Yes, people!</i>

796
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:24,562
<i>This was written
by a criminal.</i>

797
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:27,565
<i>There is malice in the ink.</i>

798
00:38:28,108 --> 00:38:29,836
<i>I can see it now.</i>

799
00:38:29,837 --> 00:38:34,142
<i>Hiltz always had a very distinctive
way of writing the letter "O."</i>

800
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:39,349
<i>It has the swirl.</i>

801
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:43,512
<i>I'm sure if the police
analyzed this autograph,</i>

802
00:38:43,513 --> 00:38:48,118
<i>they'll see the handwriting is an exact
match for the kidnapper's threatening notes.</i>

803
00:38:57,137 --> 00:39:00,402
It's the same thing
that happened in San Antonio.

804
00:39:00,641 --> 00:39:01,766
Where are your victims?

805
00:39:01,767 --> 00:39:04,640
My plan is already in motion and
there's nothing you can do to stop it.

806
00:39:05,412 --> 00:39:07,072
Somebody's re-creating the
crime from this comic book.

807
00:39:07,073 --> 00:39:08,841
What happens in this thing?
He sets them on fire.

808
00:39:08,842 --> 00:39:10,110
They're near fire.

809
00:39:11,118 --> 00:39:13,677
Dent even organized this whole
pyrotechnics display.

810
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,952
Under the stage.

811
00:39:27,467 --> 00:39:29,094
Oh, down here.

812
00:39:35,475 --> 00:39:38,171
They're here. All of them.

813
00:39:38,511 --> 00:39:40,410
Look, don't worry, everything's
going to be just fine, okay?

814
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:41,571
We're going to
get you out of here.

815
00:39:41,572 --> 00:39:42,807
Guys.

816
00:39:49,455 --> 00:39:50,716
Hi. Hi.

817
00:39:50,717 --> 00:39:52,984
So, after I collared the
villain and saved the girl,

818
00:39:52,985 --> 00:39:54,150
Jules grabbed the others

819
00:39:54,151 --> 00:39:55,784
and everyone hoisted me
on their shoulders,

820
00:39:55,785 --> 00:39:57,692
carried me to the car
chanting my name.

821
00:39:57,693 --> 00:39:59,196
It was awesome.

822
00:39:59,197 --> 00:40:02,233
Oh, but your story about
cutting the cord was good, too.

823
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:07,067
Lot of drama, suspense, twist ending
that I don't think any of us saw coming.

824
00:40:07,068 --> 00:40:08,504
At which point
did you faint?

825
00:40:08,505 --> 00:40:10,165
I did not faint.

826
00:40:10,166 --> 00:40:13,405
I was merely resting my eyes
momentarily and fell slightly backwards.

827
00:40:13,406 --> 00:40:17,608
Hey, I don't know if it makes a
difference. I think you're a hero.

828
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:19,544
Which one is hers?

829
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:21,744
I don't know.
Lassiter, you cut the cord.

830
00:40:21,745 --> 00:40:25,152
Well, they all look alike.
Is there one that poops a lot?

831
00:40:25,153 --> 00:40:27,714
I know.
Let's ask our psychic.

832
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,694
You know what, guys, this is
weird, I'm not getting anything.

833
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:35,926
I think one of these babies might be evil,
blocking my abilities to communicate.

834
00:40:35,927 --> 00:40:37,160
Damien?

835
00:40:37,161 --> 00:40:41,069
Come on. Isn't it obvious?
She looks exactly like me.

836
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,963
Hi.

837
00:40:42,964 --> 00:40:44,507
Chief, should you be up
and walking?

838
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:46,509
Walking?
I'm coming into work tomorrow.

839
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:50,638
No, don't be ridiculous. You need
to go home with your child. Relax.

840
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:52,739
Take a load off.
Refresh yourself.

841
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:55,787
January, I think January.
Come back in January.

842
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,400
So glad you both
could make it.

843
00:41:11,401 --> 00:41:13,267
Make it? I live here.

844
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:15,038
What's that behind your back,
Shawn?

845
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,198
I dropped back by the con.
You went back without me?

846
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:18,901
Those people, good people,
good hearts.

847
00:41:18,902 --> 00:41:20,944
You were right
from the beginning, Gus.

848
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:23,240
And I didn't want
to ruin the surprise.

849
00:41:23,241 --> 00:41:26,111
Introducing,
Tranya Independent Comics'

850
00:41:26,112 --> 00:41:28,811
latest limited-edition
one-shot...

851
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:31,881
Surprise.

852
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:33,719
"Follow
the adventures of Psych-Man

853
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:38,124
"as he uses his bizarre mental
powers to foil criminal plots

854
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:39,661
"with his sidekick
Magic Head."

855
00:41:39,662 --> 00:41:40,622
And bam!

856
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:49,127
What's that supposed to be?

857
00:41:49,128 --> 00:41:52,664
Dude, it's Magic Head!
It's like looking in a mirror.

858
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:55,843
Why would I need a wand
when I have a magic head?

859
00:41:55,844 --> 00:42:00,042
It's a ceremonial thing. It's,
it's just... It's representative.

860
00:42:00,043 --> 00:42:01,777
You don't actually
use the wand.

861
00:42:01,778 --> 00:42:03,284
Stupid.

862
00:42:03,285 --> 00:42:05,344
I think it's dope.

863
00:42:05,345 --> 00:42:08,186
Now, who wants an autograph?

864
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:22,428
<i>In between the lines
there's a lot of obscurity</i>

865
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:25,767
<i>I'm not inclined
to resign to maturity</i>

866
00:42:26,109 --> 00:42:29,168
<i>If it's all right
then you're all wrong</i>

867
00:42:29,169 --> 00:42:32,703
<i>But why bounce around
to the same damn song?</i>

868
00:42:33,883 --> 00:42:37,979
<i>You'd rather run
when you can't crawl</i>

869
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:43,689
<i>I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth</i>

870
00:42:43,893 --> 00:42:46,884
<i>I know, you know
They just don't have any proof</i>

871
00:42:46,885 --> 00:42:50,091
<i>Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend</i>

872
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:54,326
<i>Your worst inhibitions tend
to psych you out in the end</i>

873
00:42:54,327 --> 00:42:56,031
<i>I know, you know</i>

874
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,432
<i>I know, you know</i>
