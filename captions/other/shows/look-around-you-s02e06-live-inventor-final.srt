00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,280
You're watching BBC2.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,791
And now it's time
to go over to Shepherd's Bush

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,790
for a very special live edition
of Look Around You.

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,589
Hello and welcome
from outside BBC Television Centre

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,077
to a special live edition
of Look Around You.

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,319
Thanks, Jack. Yes, we've got a very
exciting show for you tonight.

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,591
Well, they seem excited,
because tonight is the grand final

8
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,951
of the Look Around You
Invention of the Year competition.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,152
And arriving here very shortly
to present tonight's award

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,999
is His Royal Highness,
Sir Prince Charles.

11
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,709
- So stay tuned.
- Cue the titles.

13
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,070
Hello and welcome to Studio 1

14
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,112
for this, the live final

15
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,916
of the Look Around You
Invention of the Year competition.

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,357
Tonight's show is the culmination
of a massive, nationwide search

17
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,472
to find the cream
of British inventiveness.

18
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,398
If you've been following the series,

19
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,875
you will have met
tonight's finalists,

20
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,434
five British inventors,

21
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,517
each hoping to walk away

22
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,756
with this magnificent trophy,

23
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,235
presented later on, in the studio,

24
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,990
by HRH Sir Prince Charles.

25
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,919
And all the finalists
are with us here tonight.

26
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,553
And they are...

27
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,594
Dr Phillip Lavender
and the Anti-Cobbling Cream.

28
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,270
Leonard Hatred, and the personal
soundproofing spray,

29
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,039
Psilence.

30
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,074
Teddy Clarke,
and the Vegetable Orchestra System.

31
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,878
Paul Alan and Championess, with
the horse race predicting computer.

32
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,800
And Simon Teigh,
with the Memory Helmet.

33
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,720
And may we have a big
round of applause for all of them.

34
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,991
(Applause)

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,155
And we'll be meeting them all once
again later on in the programme.

36
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,150
Now it's time to meet the inventors
of our sixth and final entry,

37
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,715
Pat Taylor and Sam MacNamara.

38
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,752
(Applause)

39
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,800
- Hello. Welcome to Look Around You.
- Thank you.

40
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,911
Your invention is unique, isn't it?

41
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,270
- Yes.
- Tell us what it is.

42
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,552
- Er, it's...
- A sex-change machine.

43
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,990
- Sex-change machine?
- Yes.

44
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,032
Well, here it is.

45
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,959
Let's have a little look at it.

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,199
I have to say, it does look a little
like a dry-cleaning machine.

47
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,640
(Laughter)

48
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,037
That's because it uses
a lot of the same technology

49
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,959
as a dry-cleaning machine,

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,276
except rather than using detergent,

51
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,631
what it does is it actually
bombards you with hormones.

52
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,640
I see. Now, I understand
your machine can change your sex

53
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,400
within about five minutes,
is that correct?

54
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:57,560
Yes, and the beauty of the system
is that it's completely reversible.

55
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,833
If you're not happy
being a man or a woman,

56
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,873
- you can change back straightaway.
- Really?

57
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,119
Yes. In fact,
I myself have changed sex 22 times.

58
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,719
- (Applause)
- And Sam,

59
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,558
how many times have you had sex?

60
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,353
(Laughter)

61
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,359
Sorry. Erm...how many times
have you changed sex?

62
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,677
Erm...

63
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,757
Probably about 50 times.

64
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,792
- About 60 times.
- (Applause)

65
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,356
Gosh! Now we have a first
for British television tonight,

66
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,394
because Sam is going to change
into a woman live on the programme.

67
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,990
We'll see Sam's transformation
a little later on.

68
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,034
Thank you both. Sam, if you'd
like to get into the machine?

69
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,072
(Applause)

70
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,673
(Machine humming)

71
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,154
Peter.

72
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,271
Thanks, Pam.
I'm looking forward to that.

73
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,357
I believe that outside the studio,

74
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,471
Jack's been joined by
a special guest.

75
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,470
No, it's not Sir Prince Charles, but
it's somebody you'll all recognise.

76
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,877
That's right. I'm here with
an old friend of Look Around You,

77
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,073
the presenter of BBC2's computer
programme, Computer Jones.

78
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,311
- Hello.
- Hello, Jack.

79
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,751
Computer Jones, who do you think
is going to win tonight?

80
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,032
As a computer man, I'd have to say
the horse-racing computer,

81
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,437
but I'm interested to see
the sex machine in operation.

82
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,518
And you have an update for us since
you were last on the show.

83
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,519
Yes. If you remember,
I was on your programme

84
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,917
and I met a very special
and beautiful lady called Patricia.

85
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,477
That's Patricia, the designer of the
computer for women, the Petticoat 5.

86
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,197
Yes, that's right. And when we met,
Jack, it was truly wonderful.

87
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,836
We went out to dinner after the
programme and had a wonderful time.

88
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,556
We talked for hours and hours
and we ended up sleeping together.

89
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,593
Well, the very next day,
we got married.

90
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:04,271
That's wonderful!
Congratulations from all of us.

91
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,357
Yes, congratulations.

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,560
And I've just been told
that Sir Prince Charles

93
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,274
has just driven past
the Royal Skeleton Society,

94
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,835
so he shouldn't be too long now.

95
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,553
(Cheering)

96
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,115
Back to you in the studio!

97
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,589
Thanks, Pealy. Well, while we wait
for Sam to complete his sex change,

98
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,031
let's go and meet some of our other
contestants tonight.

99
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,076
The devastating disease
geodermic grenatitis,

100
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,555
more commonly known as "Cobbles",

101
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,674
has the terrible effect of turning
the sufferer into a pile of rocks.

102
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,440
It's the focus
of our next invention,

103
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,312
the Anti-Cobbling Cream,

104
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,670
created by Dr Phillip Lavender.

105
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,510
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hello, Pam.

106
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,280
It's nice too see you.
You're looking very well.

107
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,872
Thank you very much. I suppose
I may have lost a couple of stones.

108
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,151
(Laughter)

109
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:19,356
Now, Doctor, your cream is designed
to reverse the effects of Cobbles,

110
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,518
turning the rocky surface
back into healthy skin.

111
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,233
That's right, Pam.

112
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,512
When we last saw you, your cream
only lasted for 15 minutes.

113
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,029
But you've made a breakthrough,
haven't you?

114
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,790
Yes, we've now formulated
a stronger version of the cream,

115
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,914
which means that it leads to
a complete and permanent recovery.

116
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,236
- That is wonderful.
- (Applause)

117
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,512
Thank you very much.

118
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,270
Now Doctor, I have to ask you...

119
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,916
Why have you chosen
not to take your own cure?

120
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,032
Well, that's a good question, Pam.

121
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,677
I suppose the answer is that
I'm rather used to the way I am now.

122
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,951
People are always very kind to me.

123
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,720
I receive a lot of attention and
sympathy.

124
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,912
And, of course, I can still fly.
Goodbye.

125
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,274
Psilence is a spray
containing liquid skin

126
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,870
that is applied directly to the ear
to reduce sound.

127
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,391
- (Man) Eliminate sound.
- I'm sorry, eliminate sound.

128
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,160
And I'm here with its inventor,
Leonard Hatred.

129
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,840
(Applause)

130
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,480
Now, although you live
in the countryside,

131
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,955
you are plagued by noise.

132
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,712
Yes, the abattoir is still
directly opposite the house.

133
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,599
And my burglar alarm's
started to play up

134
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,236
and it goes off
every ten to twelve minutes,

135
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,354
which means I have to go
down to the cellar to turn it off,

136
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,794
go all the way,
which is not only annoying,

137
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,550
but it's physically demanding.

138
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,389
On top of that, I understand that
your next-door neighbour's son...

139
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,639
- Simon...
- ..has formed a punk rock band.

140
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,675
- UK Vomit.
- Charming. Well...

141
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,680
For those of you who haven't seen
Leonard's aerosol, erm...

142
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,509
he's going to give us
a quick demonstration now.

143
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,640
So Leonard's going to spray it
directly onto this model...

144
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,990
- Oh, dear.
- (Man) Allow me.

145
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,918
I'll get it.

146
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,910
We're having a slight...
nozzle problem.

147
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,917
Have you got it?

148
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,792
The lost nozzle.

149
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,632
Can we get somebody
to give us a hand here?

150
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,479
- Got it?
- (Applause)

151
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,318
Well done.

152
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,278
OK.

153
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,954
As you can see,
the ear is completely sealed up.

154
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,676
We got there in the end.
Thank you very much, Leonard Hatred.

155
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,590
- I have to do the other ear.
- I'm sorry, we don't have time.

156
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,350
And we can now rejoin Sam MacNamara,

157
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,359
who I believe has completed
his sex-change operation.

158
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,234
You have plenty of time
for the sex-change folks.

159
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,159
- Would you please be quiet?
- It's a fix.

160
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,234
Pam, I believe you're with
Sam McNamara now.

161
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,796
Thank you. The sex-change machine
has come to the end of its cycle,

162
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,639
so let's take a look at Sam.

163
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,598
(Leonard) Fix! It's all a fix!

164
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,680
- (Pam) Wow!
- (Applause)

165
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,035
That is amazing.
What a transformation.

166
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,078
- (High voice) Thank you.
- So how do you feel?

167
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,353
I feel fine. Just more feminine.

168
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,440
Don't she look lovely? Come on.

169
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,040
(Applause)

170
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,794
(Wolf whistle)

171
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,196
You've got a better bust than me.

172
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,318
Well, best of luck, both of you,
for later on.

173
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,795
Now let's go back to Jack and Pealy

174
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,958
to find out the latest
on Sir Prince Charles.

175
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,391
Thanks, Pam. Well, he's only a
few minutes away now.

176
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,557
He's just past Goldstein Cathedral

177
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,593
and the crowd
are still very excited.

178
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,154
(Cheering and applause)

179
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,034
I could do with
a can of that Psilence spray myself!

180
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,118
Well, we've got an amazing crowd
here, as I just said.

181
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,312
And there's one very special person
with us tonight.

182
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,354
His name is Adam Sandwich.
Hello, Adam. Who are you exactly?

183
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,234
I'm the British
Counting Backwards champion.

184
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,478
Oh, that's fantastic!

185
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,753
I'm sure the crowd would love
to hear a bit of backwards counting.

186
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,792
- Would you do a bit for us?
- All right.

187
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,151
I'll count backwards
from 20 down to 10.

188
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,796
Great. So let's have a handclap
to get the rhythm going.

189
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,160
20...19...18...17...16...

190
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,760
15...13...14...13...

191
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,269
12...11...10...

192
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,233
Fantastic!

193
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,352
Thank you, Adam. Pealy.

194
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,313
Thanks, Jack. Wasn't that great?
I wish I could do that.

195
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,831
Joining us now is someone
you will recognise from the series,

196
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,839
because he is Britain's
foremost keyboard expert.

197
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,600
It's Synthesizer Patel.

198
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,078
- Hello, Synthesizer Patel.
- Hi, Pealy.

199
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,316
Who would you like to see win
tonight?

200
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,239
Well, the sex-change machine
is really something.

201
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,911
If I had invented that, they would
have to call me Sex-Change Patel.

202
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,190
We last saw you demonstrating
some of your incredible synthesizers

203
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,357
on our programme about music.

204
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,392
Yes, that was a lot of fun,

205
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,080
but good things,
they say, cannot last forever,

206
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,352
because very soon
after the programme,

207
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,790
someone stole all my synthesizers.

208
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,151
I'm very sorry to hear that.
That must have been awful.

209
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,796
They also took some of my clothes,
my sister's watch,

210
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,914
my science calculator, some shoes,
my spare glasses

211
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,236
and a wallet containing L50,

212
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,159
which I had left on top
of one of the synthesizers.

213
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,672
Well, sorry and thank you very much
for joining us, Synthesizer Patel.

214
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,077
And once again, so sad to hear
your sorry news there.

215
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,273
I think we're almost ready to go
back to the studio, where Peter...

216
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,915
They didn't take this one, hey,
Pealy? Come on!

217
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,594
(♪ Funky synthesizer solo)

218
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,632
Synthesizer Patel there,
completely taking over the show.

219
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,435
And now let's meet
our final two contestants tonight.

220
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,349
The Vegetable Orchestra System

221
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,996
harnesses the natural
harmonic vibrations of vegetables,

222
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,475
which allows them
to accurately mimic

223
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,716
a variety of musical instruments.

224
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,480
Its inventor is Teddy Clarke.

225
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,274
Hello, Teddy. Nice to see you again.

226
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,312
It's nice to be here, Pam.

227
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,877
Now, what have you and the orchestra
been up to since we last saw you?

228
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,709
Well, we've had
a very fruitful time,

229
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,070
if you'll pardon the pun.

230
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,158
We've given a lot of concerts
up and down the country.

231
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,637
We've even performed for the Pope,
down the phone line,

232
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,320
which was a great honour.

233
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,910
And I understand you've also
recorded some music for a film.

234
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:30,398
Yes. We're featured on the
soundtrack to the current Bond film.

235
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,876
And you also have a newcomer
to the Vegetable Orchestra.

236
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,560
That's right.
This piece of toast here.

237
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,320
We're very fortunate
to have her on loan

238
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,431
from the Bristol Breakfast
Orchestra.

239
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,793
Right. Now, you're going to play
a few bars from the new Bond theme.

240
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,672
We are. Thank you, Pam.

241
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,956
(♪ Orchestral rendition
of Bond theme)

♪ James Bond ♪

243
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,874

- Thank you. Teddy Clarke.

244
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,397
Peter.

245
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,514
Our next contestant is our
only four-legged inventor tonight.

246
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,917
Championess is
a particularly clever horse

247
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,714
who have devised
and constructed a computer

248
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,878
which can accurately predict
the winners of horse races.

249
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,719
She's here with her owner,
Paul Alan.

250
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,390
(Applause)

251
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,035
Hello, Paul.
And congratulations to you both

252
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,072
on getting through to the final.

253
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,911
Now, Championess' computer has
made her a wealthy horse, hasn't it?

254
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:52,637
- That's right, yes.
- How much money has she made?

255
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:57,960
Her total winnings are currently
in the region of 20 million guineas.

256
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,832
- 20 million!
- (Applause)

257
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,191
What has she spent her money on?

258
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:10,157
Well, she's bought herself
a hotel for horses.

259
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,159
(Audience giggles)

260
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,070
She's become very interested in art
and collecting paintings.

261
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,591
She's very fond of Andy Warhol.

262
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,157
- And she loves ceramics.
- And she's interested in politics?

263
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,432
Yes, she's made large donations

264
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,190
to both the Conservative
and Labour parties.

265
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,314
Really? Well, thank you very much
and best of luck.

266
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,352
(Applause)

267
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,274
Now, our final invention tonight
is the Memory Helmet,

268
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,232
created by Simon Teigh.

269
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,478
Mr Teigh was meant to be here
tonight

270
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,716
but he forgot to come. Jack.

271
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,640
(Leonard) Should have worn his
Memory Helmet then, shouldn't he?

272
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,840
(No sound)

273
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,515
Hear me now? Can you hear me?

274
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,233
Oh, good.

275
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,000
We lost sound there for a moment
but we're back on.

276
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,033
Sir Prince Charles
will be here any moment now

277
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,199
but before he arrives, we've had
a few phone calls about this banner.

278
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,630
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

279
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,991
Can you enlighten us?
What does "Hot Jon" mean?

280
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,239
Well, Hot Jon. I'm glad you
noticed. It's...

281
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,397
(No sound)

282
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,470
That's Hot Jon.

283
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,433
It's been driving me mad as well,
but now we know.

284
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,199
I'm gonna have to stop you there

285
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,312
because Sir Prince Charles
is just pulling into the BBC.

286
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,034
(Cheering and applause)

287
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,754
(Pealy) Yes, and here comes
the Prince!

288
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,074
It's a wonderful fanfare
for Sir Prince Charles.

289
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,797
- It's an electric atmosphere here.
- It's an electric atmosphere here.

290
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,033
All wanting to know
who's going to win.

291
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:28,109
The Prince seems to have noticed
our contestant, Dr Phillip Lavender,

292
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,312
who's been flying around
Shepherd's Bush this evening.

293
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,634
Apologies if you're staring at
the back of the Prince's head.

294
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,878
He should be with us in a moment,
so back to the studio.

295
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,075
Sir Prince Charles will be here
in a moment to present the award.

296
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,635
So perhaps it's worth
taking this time

297
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,320
to have a look at
the magnificent trophy.

298
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,919
Here it is, and I'm going to let you
in to a little secret now.

299
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:05,594
This award was actually designed and
made by our very own Pam Bachelor.

300
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,120
Pam, this truly is
a beautiful object.

301
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,312
- Thank you.
- Tell us a bit about the design.

302
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,750
Well, the central part of it
is an egg,

303
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:24,636
which for me represents new life,
new beginnings, new inventions.

304
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,720
And it tapers to a point,
signifying the future.

305
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,194
And what's it made of?

306
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,438
Well, it's solid gold,
plated in tin.

307
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,871
So how long have you been interested
in metalwork?

308
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,197
I got into it
because an old boyfriend...

309
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,755
(Leonard) Load of rubbish.
Piece of junk.

310
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,598
Will you please be quiet?

311
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,075
- A baby could make that.
- (Teddy) Settle down.

312
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,510
- Shut up.
- I beg your pardon?

313
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,997
You are a very rude young man
and you're ruining it for everybody.

314
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,271
Oh, fuck off!

315
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,710
Ooh... Erm...

316
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,310
We apologise
for the strong language there

317
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,070
and hope it hasn't caused offence.

318
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,032
Well, we appear to be experiencing
a few problems

319
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,677
with our live broadcast
from Studio 1.

320
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:29,030
But I believe
we can now rejoin Look Around You.

321
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,869
Well, hello again. We're back with
the Invention of the Year final.

322
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,880
We apologise for the behaviour
of our finalist, Leonard Hatred.

323
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,037
He has now been disqualified

324
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,914
and removed from the studio
by our security guards,

325
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,557
who, I must say, have handled
the situation impeccably.

326
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,592
(Applause)

327
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,716
And now we're honoured to have His
Royal Highness Sir Prince Charles

328
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,832
with us in the studio
to present tonight's award.

329
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,515
So, Your Royal Highness,

330
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,314
can we hear from you now
who the winner is?

331
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,920
(Applause)

332
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,350
Ladies and gentlemen, first of all,

333
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,120
I want to say how grateful I am
to the BBC

334
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,358
and to the Look Around You team
in particular

335
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,790
for establishing this award.

336
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,150
When we set up this scheme,

337
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,513
I was delighted to work
hand in hand with Look Around You

338
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,792
to ensure that a large
number of people in this country

339
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:49,551
actually discover,
through the medium of television,

340
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,478
that there are some highly original,

341
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,311
potentially successful
and British ideas about.

342
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,111
I know the judges
found it extremely difficult

343
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,916
to decide the winner from such
a diverse range of products.

344
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:12,673
But in the end they agreed that the
winner of this year's award is...

345
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,712
(Drum roll)

346
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,791
The sex-change machine,

347
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,197
entered by Pat Taylor
and Sam MacNamara.

348
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,112
Marvellous. Well done.
Were you surprised?

349
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,914
We were indeed surprised, yes.

350
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,031
I don't know
where you're going to put it

351
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,992
but I hope you find
a suitable place.

352
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,953
And which one of you is which?

353
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,959
I'm Pat and this is Sam.

354
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,597
Sam was a woman earlier in the show.
He's now changed into a man.

355
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,950
- I mean, the other way around.
- Really?

356
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,515
Yes, sir.

357
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:07,873
You have had great success, haven't
you, with the production of it?

358
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,197
Yes. Dry-cleaners are always
getting rid of their old machines

359
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:17,589
and they're pretty easy to convert
into sex-change devices.

360
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,712
I hope it goes from
strength to strength. Mazel tov.

361
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,797
Thank you very much indeed.

362
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,749
Well, thank you,
Your Royal Highness.

363
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,759
- And congratulations...
- (Commotion)

364
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,998
(Shouting and screaming)

365
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,151
We're still experiencing problems
with our live broadcast,

366
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,876
but we hope to return to Studio 1
shortly.

367
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,197
In the meantime,
here's a short film.

368
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,440
One of the benefits of living
in the countryside

369
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,837
is the large variety of birds
you can see in the wild.

370
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,150
Here's a couple of finches.

371
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,192
Some finches can live
up to 60 years,

372
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,914
although these two
are probably only about 40.

373
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,998
Here's a robin.
I wonder what it's thinking about.

374
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,399
Here's a blackbird.

375
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,591
There's a thrush.

376
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,632
It's stuffed.

377
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,678
Here's a couple of hand birds.

378
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,872
One of them has caught a worm.

379
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,311
Now let's take a look
at a typical bird's nest.

380
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,238
This one belongs to a crow.

381
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,911
He's out at the moment,
so we can have a good look around.

382
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,920
The crow's made a sort of burglar
alarm out of old milk bottle tops.

383
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,273
Luckily, we've managed
to deactivate it.

384
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,959
In crow terms,
this one's probably a millionaire...

385
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,835
And we can now return
to Look Around You.

386
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,754
Well, welcome back. Um...

387
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,477
We've had some rather shocking
things happen here in Studio 1,

388
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,992
but thankfully,
the situation is now under control.

389
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,272
A few moments ago,
Leonard Hatred re-entered the studio

390
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,516
and caused havoc.

391
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:44,316
He forced Jack into
the sex-change machine,

392
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:48,354
and worse still, attacked Sir Prince
Charles with his can of Psilence.

393
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,950
But don't worry, the Prince is fine,

394
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,677
and has kindly and graciously agreed
to remain with us in the studio

395
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,440
until the end of the programme.

396
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,836
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

397
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,396
- (Man) Well done, Charlie!
- (Applause)

398
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,070
We're still trying to free Jack
from the sex-change machine

399
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,397
but the good news is that
Leonard Hatred has been restrained.

400
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,671
So thank you to Dr Phillip Lavender

401
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,509
and to our excellent security men,

402
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,200
Hank Sullivan and Hank Fletcher.

403
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,913
Thanks, Hanks.

404
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,758
Thanks.

405
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,630
And thanks once again
to our winners,

406
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,957
and to almost all of our finalists,

407
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,640
for taking part in the competition.

408
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,275
Sadly, that's the last
in the present series.

409
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,836
But we wouldn't have been able
to do it without you, the viewers.

410
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,634
Thank you for staying with us
over the last six weeks,

411
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,797
and for all your phone calls
and letters.

412
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,991
It really means a lot to us.

413
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,838
Got it.

414
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,872
(Applause)

415
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,997
Are you OK?

416
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,793
(Applause and whistles)

417
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,992
(High voice) We'll see you again
in our next series,

418
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,919
when we'll be bringing you
more exciting developments

419
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:19,354
from the world and the future
of science and technology.

420
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,629
- Well done, Jack.
- I'm Jackie.

421
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,034
So, in the meantime,
from all of us here at Studio 1,

422
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:31,518
take care of yourself and remember,
wherever you are, whatever you do...

423
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,552
