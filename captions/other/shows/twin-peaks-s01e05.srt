1
00:01:48,847 --> 00:01:52,021
Yeah. Yeah, his hair was long.

2
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:55,650
Filthy, grey on grey, long hair.

3
00:02:09,664 --> 00:02:14,419
I saw him. At the foot of Laura's bed.

4
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:16,474
He looked like an animal.

5
00:02:16,474 --> 00:02:20,442
Had you seen this man before?
- No. Never.

6
00:02:20,442 --> 00:02:24,116
His face. My God, his face!

7
00:02:24,116 --> 00:02:28,513
Sarah, did you tell them
about the necklace?

8
00:02:28,513 --> 00:02:31,523
They're gonna love that one.
- What necklace?

9
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,779
She's had two visions.

10
00:02:35,779 --> 00:02:38,166
Go ahead, Sarah.

11
00:02:38,755 --> 00:02:40,967
Leland.

12
00:02:40,967 --> 00:02:42,801
Leland.

13
00:02:43,436 --> 00:02:44,935
Sarah.

14
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:49,487
It's night.

15
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:54,591
A flashlight beam
moves across the ground.

16
00:02:54,591 --> 00:03:00,281
Then a hand, a gloved hand,

17
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:05,883
lifts a rock and takes out a necklace,

18
00:03:05,883 --> 00:03:09,100
broken in half.

19
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,647
It was Laura's.

20
00:03:12,864 --> 00:03:16,240
Invitation to love.

21
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:24,313
Don't fight it, Chet.

22
00:03:24,313 --> 00:03:28,241
You know as well as I
there's still something between us.

23
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:31,464
There always will be.

24
00:03:31,464 --> 00:03:35,014
For God's sake, Emerald.
That may be true, but...

25
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:38,775
I'm married to your sister now.
It's wrong.

26
00:03:38,775 --> 00:03:42,121
You always said
you could never tell us apart, so...

27
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:44,455
Morning, Lucy. What's going on?

28
00:03:44,455 --> 00:03:48,140
Thanks to Jade,
Jared decided not to kill himself

29
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,234
and he's leaving the Towers
to Jade instead of Emerald.

30
00:03:51,445 --> 00:03:56,878
Emerald knows, and is now seducing
Chet for the will so she can destroy it.

31
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:01,557
Montana plans to kill Jared so the
Towers will belong to Emerald and him.

32
00:04:01,557 --> 00:04:05,186
I think she's gonna double-cross him,
and he doesn't know it yet.

33
00:04:05,186 --> 00:04:06,777
Poor Chet.

34
00:04:06,994 --> 00:04:09,242
What's going on here?

35
00:04:09,242 --> 00:04:13,004
Agent Cooper's in the conference room
with Dr Jacoby.

36
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:15,350
Thank you.

37
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:19,528
Lucy, why couldn't I
spend the night last night?

38
00:04:19,528 --> 00:04:23,084
Will you be having coffee,
Deputy Brennan?

39
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:41,748
Was Laura Palmer seeing you
because she was addicted to cocaine?

40
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:47,433
Agent Cooper, I'd like to help you,
but I got a little problem here.

41
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:50,859
Maybe there's
some sort of hula we can do

42
00:04:50,859 --> 00:04:54,406
around my doctor-patient
confidentiality?

43
00:04:54,406 --> 00:04:57,832
She came to you
because she was having problems?

44
00:04:57,832 --> 00:05:00,053
Oh, my, yes.

45
00:05:00,053 --> 00:05:02,429
Were her problems
of a sexual nature?

46
00:05:02,429 --> 00:05:04,270
Agent Cooper.

47
00:05:05,115 --> 00:05:10,037
The problems of our entire society
are of a sexual nature.

48
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:14,804
Tibet.

49
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,822
You know, my abiding interests
lie to the east, as well.

50
00:05:18,822 --> 00:05:21,708
But only as far as Hawaii.

51
00:05:22,336 --> 00:05:27,806
The ancient Hawaiians often turned to
the soothing rhizome of the ginger plant

52
00:05:27,806 --> 00:05:31,111
to ease the pain
of profound confusion, which,

53
00:05:31,111 --> 00:05:33,997
more often than not, was sexual.

54
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,752
Ginger is nonaddictive, cocaine is.

55
00:05:37,752 --> 00:05:41,600
The fact that Laura Palmer
sought medication,

56
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,316
no matter how dubious,
was actually a positive sign.

57
00:05:45,316 --> 00:05:48,495
Doctor Jacoby, lunderstand
you cared deeply for Laura Palmer.

58
00:05:48,495 --> 00:05:50,631
Why won't you help us?

59
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:57,364
My own personal investigation,
I suspect,

60
00:05:57,364 --> 00:06:00,991
will be ongoing for the rest of my life.

61
00:06:01,837 --> 00:06:02,737
Laura had secrets.

62
00:06:06,811 --> 00:06:11,899
And around those secrets
she built the fortress,

63
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:16,673
well, that in my six months with her,
I was not able to penetrate,

64
00:06:16,673 --> 00:06:20,932
and for which I consider myself
an abject failure.

65
00:06:20,932 --> 00:06:27,163
Doctor, did Laura ever discuss Bobby
Briggs or James Hurley with you?

66
00:06:27,163 --> 00:06:30,300
They were boys, Laura was a woman.

67
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,847
She had sex with three men
the night she was murdered.

68
00:06:33,847 --> 00:06:36,234
Were you one of them?

69
00:06:37,493 --> 00:06:38,693
No.

70
00:06:38,693 --> 00:06:41,373
Who killed her, Doctor Jacoby?

71
00:06:41,373 --> 00:06:43,881
The night after Laura died

72
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:48,893
I followed a man
that Laura had spoken to me about.

73
00:06:48,893 --> 00:06:51,441
He was driving a red Corvette.

74
00:06:51,441 --> 00:06:55,793
I followed him to the Old Sawmill
Road, and then I lost him.

75
00:06:55,793 --> 00:06:58,256
And that, gentlemen,
is all I can tell you.

76
00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:02,786
Agent Cooper, a Gordon Cole
says you're expecting his call.

77
00:07:02,786 --> 00:07:06,721
Should I put him through?
- Yes, Lucy, put him through.

78
00:07:06,721 --> 00:07:08,689
Thank you, Doctor. That's all.

79
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,489
You'll be in town, Doctor?

80
00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:17,796
Well, I'm planning a pilgrimage
to Pebble Beach,

81
00:07:17,796 --> 00:07:20,763
but that's not till the end of the month.

82
00:07:20,763 --> 00:07:23,481
Hang loose, haoles.

83
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:26,657
Leo Johnson drives a red Corvette?
- Yes.

84
00:07:26,657 --> 00:07:30,207
How we doing on Jacques Renault?
- There's an APB on him.

85
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:34,391
His brother made bail this morning.
I got an "All Points" on him, too.

86
00:07:34,391 --> 00:07:37,192
Harry, this is my supervisor.

87
00:07:39,288 --> 00:07:42,213
Morning, Gordon. How are we doing?
- Where do we start?

88
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:46,554
The Palmer girl or Albert's
new best friend, Harry Truman?

89
00:07:46,554 --> 00:07:49,439
Laura Palmer.
- Albert has been very busy.

90
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,240
The twine he found on her upper arm
is a common household variety:

91
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,129
Finley's Fine Twine.

92
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:59,435
And the twine on her wrists?
- Definitely not a match. No ID yet.

93
00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:03,187
And those marks
on her shoulders, bird bites.

94
00:08:03,187 --> 00:08:07,372
He'll also fax a reconstruction of the
plastic fragment from her stomach.

95
00:08:07,372 --> 00:08:10,081
Great. We're anxiously
awaiting his results.

96
00:08:10,081 --> 00:08:14,440
Now for the bad news, Coop. I've got
an OOJ and an AFO from Albert

97
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,735
concerning his "mano a mano"
with the local sheriff, Truman.

98
00:08:17,735 --> 00:08:19,992
Albert wants this guy's badge, Coop.

99
00:08:19,992 --> 00:08:24,174
Gordon, here's how it is.
You know Albert.

100
00:08:24,174 --> 00:08:28,687
Sheriff Truman displayed a saint's
patience not clocking him before.

101
00:08:28,687 --> 00:08:32,875
He wants it filed with the US Attorney.
- File it under F for forget it.

102
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:37,053
Tell Albert if he wants to pursue this,
I'll fight him all the way to Washington!

103
00:08:37,053 --> 00:08:39,557
Don't get excited...
- Later, Gordon.

104
00:08:42,406 --> 00:08:46,459
Thanks. I didn't get
a whole lot of sleep last night.

105
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,791
The last thing
I want you to worry about

106
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:53,931
is some city slicker I brought into
your town relieving himself upstream.

107
00:08:55,571 --> 00:08:58,700
This is the man I saw in my dream.
- You saw this man?

108
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,964
I had an intuition that my dream and
Sarah Palmer's vision were connected.

109
00:09:02,964 --> 00:09:07,975
I didn't go because I didn't wanna
influence her. I'm a strong sender.

110
00:09:07,975 --> 00:09:12,998
The eyes were closer together.
- Deputy Hawk for Agent Cooper.

111
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,721
Hawk.

112
00:09:16,721 --> 00:09:19,184
Right. Stay there.

113
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,317
Follow him if he moves.

114
00:09:22,241 --> 00:09:25,949
Travelling east on Highway 12,
how long is it to the Timber Falls Motel?

115
00:09:25,949 --> 00:09:28,464
10 minutes.
- Half an hour. Depends how you go.

116
00:09:28,464 --> 00:09:31,471
Hawk's found our one-armed man.

117
00:09:42,255 --> 00:09:46,642
I wish I could've seen Josie's face,
opening the safe for her lawman Romeo

118
00:09:46,642 --> 00:09:49,224
to show him the double set of books.

119
00:09:49,224 --> 00:09:52,903
And all she finds
is the one I've been slowly cooking.

120
00:09:52,903 --> 00:09:55,708
Where's the book
that spells bankruptcy?

121
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:59,133
I have more than one hiding place.

122
00:10:00,103 --> 00:10:02,100
My desk upstairs.

123
00:10:03,698 --> 00:10:06,574
There's a drop panel
on the top drawer.

124
00:10:06,574 --> 00:10:10,590
Not even Pete the poodle
knows about that one.

125
00:10:12,852 --> 00:10:15,775
I'm famished.

126
00:10:21,002 --> 00:10:24,760
I suppose room service
is too much to expect

127
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,731
of this rusticated mildewfarm.

128
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:32,738
You would prefer the Lumber Baron
Suite at the Great Northern.

129
00:10:32,738 --> 00:10:36,625
I'd prefer getting on with setting
the torch to that damn mill.

130
00:10:43,073 --> 00:10:46,164
Harry, he's here at the motel.

131
00:10:46,164 --> 00:10:48,877
Room 101. Last name is Gerard.

132
00:10:48,877 --> 00:10:54,857
Now, when the mill goes up in smoke,
the headline we're after is,

133
00:10:54,857 --> 00:10:59,658
"Josie Packard torches
bankrupt mill in insurance fraud",

134
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:05,345
not "Giant weenie roast in the woods".

135
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:18,090
Mr Gerard, it's the police. Open up!

136
00:11:19,014 --> 00:11:21,558
What? Jeez!

137
00:11:24,824 --> 00:11:28,035
Gunplay. Sounds serious.

138
00:11:30,551 --> 00:11:32,631
Mr Gerard!

139
00:11:34,772 --> 00:11:36,770
Don't move.
- Oh, my God!

140
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:40,323
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

141
00:11:48,064 --> 00:11:51,655
You let me know
if there's any bloodshed.

142
00:11:51,655 --> 00:11:55,833
I'm going to give little Elvis a bath.

143
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,298
You know this man.

144
00:12:18,298 --> 00:12:22,344
No, sir. I've never seen
that man before in my life.

145
00:12:22,344 --> 00:12:25,696
But, you know,
he kind of looks like somebody.

146
00:12:25,696 --> 00:12:28,278
Mr Gerard,
do you have a friend named Bob?

147
00:12:28,278 --> 00:12:30,835
Bob Lydecker is my best friend.

148
00:12:30,835 --> 00:12:33,890
Why have you been at the hospital?
- Bob's in a coma.

149
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:39,105
A Lydecker was assaulted three
days ago outside a bar in Lotown.

150
00:12:39,105 --> 00:12:42,415
That's Bob.
- Is your friend Bob a doctor?

151
00:12:42,415 --> 00:12:45,261
He's the best darn veterinarian
in these parts.

152
00:12:45,261 --> 00:12:46,101
Thanks.

153
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:50,818
He's clean: no record, no warrants.

154
00:12:51,696 --> 00:12:54,621
Take a look at his car.

155
00:12:54,621 --> 00:12:57,834
Your middle name is Michael.
- Named after my uncle.

156
00:12:57,834 --> 00:13:01,344
How did you lose the arm?
- Car accident.

157
00:13:01,344 --> 00:13:05,574
I was on the road
from Memphis to someplace.

158
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,576
Selling pharmaceuticals.
A pretty good job.

159
00:13:12,723 --> 00:13:15,980
That's what I'm selling these days.
Everybody needs shoes.

160
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,609
They're all for the right foot.
- It's my sample case.

161
00:13:19,609 --> 00:13:22,288
Two-day delivery guaranteed.

162
00:13:22,288 --> 00:13:25,546
We could certainly take care of
all your departmental needs.

163
00:13:25,546 --> 00:13:29,015
The arm you lost,
did it have a tattoo?

164
00:13:29,015 --> 00:13:31,693
What's this all about?

165
00:13:31,693 --> 00:13:34,659
I'm a shoe salesman.
- Settle down, Mr Gerard.

166
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:39,137
He asked you a question.
- If you won't tell us, we can find out.

167
00:13:39,137 --> 00:13:41,851
What did it say?

168
00:13:44,155 --> 00:13:46,318
It said...

169
00:13:47,206 --> 00:13:47,926
"Mom"!

170
00:13:57,447 --> 00:13:58,647
Harry.

171
00:14:01,502 --> 00:14:04,879
What you got?
- Car was staked out when I got here.

172
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,595
It was Josie Packard.

173
00:14:23,886 --> 00:14:26,382
I've been doing some research.

174
00:14:28,483 --> 00:14:31,527
In real life, there is no algebra.

175
00:14:31,527 --> 00:14:35,375
Maybe you should run away
and join the circus.

176
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:39,594
Escape!
I've got a better idea.

177
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,200
A tall, dark and handsome stranger
falls madly in love with me

178
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:50,250
and takes me away to a life of mystery
and international intrigue.

179
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:54,386
You mean the FBI agent?
Dream on.

180
00:14:54,386 --> 00:14:55,106
Maybe.

181
00:14:57,493 --> 00:15:00,452
Maybe he'll realise
I'm the woman of his dreams,

182
00:15:00,452 --> 00:15:05,341
because I'm gonna help him
figure out who killed Laura.

183
00:15:05,341 --> 00:15:07,561
And you're gonna help me.

184
00:15:07,561 --> 00:15:11,491
Fact: Laura was seeing James Hurley
behind Bobby's back.

185
00:15:11,491 --> 00:15:16,299
What if she was?
- So it is true.

186
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:19,768
Fact: Laura had a sweet tooth
for nose candy.

187
00:15:19,768 --> 00:15:21,983
I guess it's not such a big secret.

188
00:15:23,367 --> 00:15:27,622
I didn't know Laura half as well as you,
and I knew the score. Laura was wild.

189
00:15:28,216 --> 00:15:30,676
Come on, will you help me?

190
00:15:32,395 --> 00:15:35,688
What else have you figured out,
Sherlock?

191
00:15:35,688 --> 00:15:37,945
The morning of the funeral,

192
00:15:37,945 --> 00:15:42,045
Dr Jacoby is trying to get
my brother Johnny to go the funeral.

193
00:15:42,045 --> 00:15:45,387
He tells Johnny that Laura's
in a better place now, blah, blah,

194
00:15:45,387 --> 00:15:50,989
and he knows that,
because Laura was his patient.

195
00:15:55,051 --> 00:15:57,891
Laura was seeing Jacoby?
- It gets better.

196
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:02,198
Ever heard of One-Eyed Jacks?
- That western with Marlon Brando?

197
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:07,130
It's a place across the border.
They have girls working there.

198
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,502
You think Laura was one of them?

199
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:12,973
I don't know. If it's true,
wouldn't you wanna know?

200
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:15,231
It would explain a few things.

201
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:21,584
You know, I think about Laura
being in a place like that,

202
00:16:21,584 --> 00:16:24,512
and I get all shivery.
But it's like a hot cold.

203
00:16:24,512 --> 00:16:29,692
Like when you hold an ice cube
on your bare skin for a long time.

204
00:16:29,692 --> 00:16:36,378
I'll help you. But whatever we find out,
we have to promise to keep it a secret.

205
00:16:36,378 --> 00:16:38,934
It's a deal. I know where to start.

206
00:16:38,934 --> 00:16:42,906
Did you know Ronnette and Laura
worked in the same place?

207
00:16:42,906 --> 00:16:47,965
The perfume counter
at my father's department store.

208
00:17:03,363 --> 00:17:08,036
Have a chat with Hank before
the hearing. He's glad you're here.

209
00:17:08,036 --> 00:17:11,005
I hope I didn't come on
too strong yesterday.

210
00:17:11,005 --> 00:17:15,476
I'll be sure to tell him how helpful
you've been, Mr Mooney.

211
00:17:37,063 --> 00:17:39,903
Haven't seen you for a while, Norma.

212
00:17:39,903 --> 00:17:42,913
I've been kind of busy.
- So...

213
00:17:42,913 --> 00:17:46,291
Business is good?
- Yeah.

214
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,190
You gotta back me up
in there, Norma, please.

215
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:55,861
I gotta get out. It's starting
to put the zap on me big time.

216
00:17:56,833 --> 00:18:01,589
I know I have no right to ask
and you have no reason to believe me,

217
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:04,221
but I'll change.

218
00:18:05,193 --> 00:18:08,819
I swear on my life,
I have changed.

219
00:18:10,962 --> 00:18:14,589
Give me a chance
to prove it to you.

220
00:18:14,589 --> 00:18:19,319
I've replayed it in my mind a million
times, and I don't have any answers.

221
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:22,282
A car in perfect condition
goes out of control.

222
00:18:22,282 --> 00:18:27,301
A vagrant nobody knows is killed
while sleeping by the roadside.

223
00:18:27,301 --> 00:18:30,106
Why did fate deal me this hand?

224
00:18:30,106 --> 00:18:32,989
You are not incarcerated
for an act of fate, Mr Jennings.

225
00:18:32,989 --> 00:18:36,164
I accept that, but it was fate,

226
00:18:36,164 --> 00:18:40,555
maybe even luck, that sent me to jail,
just as much as the car accident.

227
00:18:41,182 --> 00:18:46,318
What is your point?
- I know I have a lot to makeup for.

228
00:18:46,318 --> 00:18:49,284
For the life I destroyed

229
00:18:49,284 --> 00:18:54,596
and for another life
I very nearly destroyed.

230
00:18:54,596 --> 00:18:58,814
Mrs Jennings, your husband would be
facing a difficult re-entry...

231
00:18:58,814 --> 00:19:04,166
How would you help him?
- I own a diner in Twin Peaks.

232
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,468
I can give him a job.

233
00:19:06,468 --> 00:19:09,980
The boss is tough, but fair.

234
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:13,816
And you would live together
as man and wife?

235
00:19:14,622 --> 00:19:17,298
Well, he is my husband, isn't he?

236
00:19:18,216 --> 00:19:20,345
We have what we need here.

237
00:19:20,345 --> 00:19:23,892
We'll make our decision
without the inmate present.

238
00:19:25,323 --> 00:19:28,580
We'll let you know
by five o'clock today.

239
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,736
Catch you later.

240
00:19:57,298 --> 00:20:01,888
In my dream, Mike said he and Bob
lived above a convenience store.

241
00:20:01,888 --> 00:20:07,034
Cooper, I'd think you'd be afraid
to go to sleep at night.

242
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:17,408
Hey, Hawk.

243
00:20:18,877 --> 00:20:23,429
Andy, could you go into the One Stop
and get me some twine?

244
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:41,449
No, that's not Doctor Lydecker.

245
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:45,421
Does Doctor Lydecker treat birds?
- Well, yes, of course.

246
00:20:47,063 --> 00:20:50,486
You know, there are
plenty other vets in Twin Peaks.

247
00:20:50,486 --> 00:20:53,154
Only one has
a best friend with one arm.

248
00:20:53,154 --> 00:20:57,844
Harry, in the heat
of the investigative pursuit,

249
00:20:57,844 --> 00:21:01,687
the shortest distance between two
points is not necessarily a straight line.

250
00:21:01,687 --> 00:21:05,949
Andy. Hand me that spool
of Finley's Fine Twine.

251
00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:09,666
Miss Loomer,
we're confiscating your files.

252
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,180
What?

253
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,345
As clear as the signs on the turnpike,

254
00:21:13,345 --> 00:21:17,743
the bird that attacked Laura Palmer
is a client of this office.

255
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,213
I feel so bad for you.

256
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:40,564
I was watching you at the funeral,
and my heart was aching.

257
00:21:40,564 --> 00:21:43,858
I wanted to hold you so much.

258
00:21:46,124 --> 00:21:48,287
That James Hurley.

259
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,016
He was seeing Laura
behind my back.

260
00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:55,148
I'm gonna fix him.

261
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,739
Fix me first.

262
00:22:01,548 --> 00:22:05,056
When is Leo due back?

263
00:22:06,146 --> 00:22:08,309
Don't worry, bad boy.

264
00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:11,286
I can hear his 'Vette a mile away.

265
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:16,001
Don't mess around with this, Shelly.
Where is he?

266
00:22:17,893 --> 00:22:21,184
He's with his friend,
that creepy Jacques.

267
00:22:23,911 --> 00:22:26,872
Jacques, who?

268
00:22:27,674 --> 00:22:30,431
That Canuck guy
that works at the Roadhouse.

269
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:31,978
Leo and Jacques?

270
00:22:31,978 --> 00:22:34,143
What's the matter?

271
00:22:37,872 --> 00:22:40,631
Gotta think. I gotta think.

272
00:22:40,631 --> 00:22:45,762
Well, think later, Bobby. I have
to go back to the diner in half an hour.

273
00:22:46,692 --> 00:22:48,903
I gotta tell you something.

274
00:22:49,241 --> 00:22:51,072
What is it?

275
00:22:51,072 --> 00:22:54,839
I've been on to this for a while,
checking it out. It's pretty bad.

276
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:57,138
Tell me.

277
00:22:57,138 --> 00:23:01,779
Leo and Jacques are running drugs
across the border. Cocaine.

278
00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:05,407
They've been selling them at school.

279
00:23:05,407 --> 00:23:08,129
I knew Leo was messed up
in something.

280
00:23:08,129 --> 00:23:11,928
I think it's even possible
they were giving drugs to Laura.

281
00:23:11,928 --> 00:23:14,816
Bobby, I have to show you something.

282
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:24,801
This was in Leo's truck
two days after Laura was murdered.

283
00:23:24,801 --> 00:23:27,566
Are you sure this is Leo's?

284
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:31,460
It has his initials on the collar.

285
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,255
He makes me sew them
into everything.

286
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:41,314
Shelly, this could be
the answer to our prayers.

287
00:23:42,243 --> 00:23:44,822
What do you mean?

288
00:23:44,822 --> 00:23:50,935
You don't need to know.
I'm gonna take this, OK?

289
00:23:50,935 --> 00:23:54,565
You never saw this. Say it,

290
00:23:55,243 --> 00:23:59,666
"I never saw it."
- I never saw it.

291
00:24:00,343 --> 00:24:03,053
Leo's not gonna be
a problem for us any more.

292
00:24:03,053 --> 00:24:06,526
Stay clear of him and keep quiet.

293
00:24:11,796 --> 00:24:13,793
I bought this.

294
00:24:13,793 --> 00:24:16,768
You know how to use it?

295
00:24:18,986 --> 00:24:21,827
I thought you could teach me.

296
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:24,670
Teach me, Bobby.

297
00:24:30,825 --> 00:24:32,954
Take them into the conference room.

298
00:24:32,954 --> 00:24:37,547
Lucy, go through these files and
pull out the people who own birds.

299
00:24:38,225 --> 00:24:42,278
How will I know they own birds?
- lt'll say so on the cards.

300
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:47,250
OK, I'll start going through
the files, then.

301
00:24:51,518 --> 00:24:56,154
Agent Cooper, I'm so sorry.
My gun just slipped out of my hand.

302
00:24:56,154 --> 00:24:58,653
Ever used your weapon
in the line of duty?

303
00:24:58,653 --> 00:25:03,634
No, sir. I can't explain what happened.
I've been feeling a little high-strung.

304
00:25:03,634 --> 00:25:06,564
Lack of preparation.
We'll take care of that.

305
00:25:06,564 --> 00:25:11,736
Andy, get ammunition from the lockbox.
Meet us downstairs at the pistol range.

306
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:21,315
Lucy, did you hear what happened?
I feel so dumb.

307
00:25:21,315 --> 00:25:23,948
I dropped my gun, and it went off.

308
00:25:23,948 --> 00:25:27,248
Are you all right?
- Oh, yeah. I guess so, but...

309
00:25:27,248 --> 00:25:30,764
I'd like to chat, but I am under orders
to examine these files,

310
00:25:30,764 --> 00:25:33,693
so if you'll excuse me, please.

311
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:40,013
Laura Palmer's murder
was vicious and calculated.

312
00:25:40,013 --> 00:25:43,027
No telling what we'll encounter
bringing a suspect to ground.

313
00:25:43,027 --> 00:25:45,531
After Andy's mishap,
I wanna make certain

314
00:25:45,531 --> 00:25:47,825
we're comfortable with our firearms.

315
00:25:47,825 --> 00:25:49,245
Nice piece.

316
00:25:49,245 --> 00:25:52,633
Actually, it's standard issue;
I made a few modifications.

317
00:25:52,633 --> 00:25:55,811
How long has Lucy
Been upset with Andy?

318
00:25:55,811 --> 00:25:59,327
Body language?
- It was yelling through a megaphone.

319
00:25:59,327 --> 00:26:02,838
Six rounds a piece to start with, Andy.
- OK.

320
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,762
Care to tell us
about you and Lucy, Andy?

321
00:26:06,762 --> 00:26:10,611
Jeez, you can tell?
- Not many secrets left around here.

322
00:26:11,495 --> 00:26:14,585
She won't speak to me,
and I don't know why.

323
00:26:14,585 --> 00:26:19,801
And I don't know why she's doing what
she's doing. I just can't figure her out.

324
00:26:19,801 --> 00:26:22,898
There's no logic at work here, Andy.

325
00:26:22,898 --> 00:26:26,497
In the grand design, women were
drawn from a different set of blueprints.

326
00:26:26,497 --> 00:26:29,045
Amen to that.
- Amen.

327
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:31,678
Hawk, Andy.

328
00:26:33,732 --> 00:26:35,312
Rapid fire.

329
00:26:50,452 --> 00:26:54,957
Hawk: six for six, two kills,
high marks. Andy...

330
00:26:56,721 --> 00:26:59,682
Andy, what we need
is practice and lots of it.

331
00:26:59,682 --> 00:27:02,859
One hour, three times a week.
Harry, supply the ordnance?

332
00:27:02,859 --> 00:27:05,245
Whatever it takes.

333
00:27:05,245 --> 00:27:07,628
Chin up, Andy.

334
00:27:09,471 --> 00:27:12,049
You ever been married, Cooper?
- No.

335
00:27:12,981 --> 00:27:17,203
I knew someone once who helped me
understand commitment,

336
00:27:17,203 --> 00:27:20,877
the responsibilities and the risks...

337
00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:25,185
...who taught me
the pain of a broken heart.

338
00:27:40,193 --> 00:27:42,524
One woman can make you fly
like an eagle.

339
00:27:42,524 --> 00:27:45,792
Another can give you
the strength of a lion.

340
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:49,968
But only one in the cycle of life
can fill your heart with wonder

341
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:53,647
and the wisdom
that you have known a singular joy.

342
00:27:54,404 --> 00:27:57,828
I wrote that for my girlfriend.
- Local gal?

343
00:27:57,828 --> 00:28:01,416
Diane Shapiro, PhD, Brandeis.

344
00:28:04,436 --> 00:28:09,109
Harry: one miss, five hits,
three kills. Excellent.

345
00:28:13,173 --> 00:28:14,920
Only four hits?

346
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:18,972
I put four through the eyes
and one through each nostril.

347
00:28:18,972 --> 00:28:22,485
Agent Cooper, I'm looking
at the files from Lydecker's.

348
00:28:22,485 --> 00:28:27,755
I have hereunder A's an Arky,
who's a part poodle, part Rottweiler,

349
00:28:27,755 --> 00:28:30,139
who lives on Maple
and belongs to Mr Rumple.

350
00:28:30,139 --> 00:28:34,531
I have an Annette, an otter who
lives with a family near Oak River.

351
00:28:34,531 --> 00:28:36,863
We wanted the name of birds.

352
00:28:36,863 --> 00:28:39,674
I know, but the files
are organised alphabetically.

353
00:28:39,674 --> 00:28:43,680
Lucy, go through the bird file.
- You don't understand.

354
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,811
They're organised alphabetically
under the names of the pet.

355
00:28:47,811 --> 00:28:50,785
We're gonna need some more coffee.

356
00:29:02,796 --> 00:29:08,929
Thanks, Toad. I'll be sure to get this
into my retirement fund asap.

357
00:29:13,412 --> 00:29:15,991
Shelly, you're gonna scare
the customers.

358
00:29:15,991 --> 00:29:22,138
I've got one man too many in my life,
and I'm married to him. Sound familiar?

359
00:29:22,138 --> 00:29:25,239
Maybe you should have
a little talk with Leo.

360
00:29:26,203 --> 00:29:28,248
Leo doesn't talk.

361
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,000
He hits.

362
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,192
He was so great at first, you know?
This flashy guy in his hot car.

363
00:29:38,192 --> 00:29:40,821
Then we get married, and I find out

364
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:44,043
all he was looking for was a maid
he didn't have to pay.

365
00:29:45,932 --> 00:29:48,429
I feel so stupid.

366
00:29:49,402 --> 00:29:51,446
Look at us.

367
00:29:53,456 --> 00:29:58,675
Two men apiece and we don't know
what to do with any of the four of them.

368
00:29:58,675 --> 00:30:03,021
So how did Hank's hearing go?
- No decision till this afternoon.

369
00:30:03,021 --> 00:30:06,577
Have you told him
you're divorcing him for Ed?

370
00:30:08,044 --> 00:30:13,013
When I saw him, I...
He might not even get out this time.

371
00:30:13,013 --> 00:30:16,609
I guess my plans
are a little up in the air.

372
00:30:16,609 --> 00:30:22,333
Yeah, well,
I've definitely got plans for Leo.

373
00:30:29,947 --> 00:30:34,418
You know what were gonna do, Shelly,
tomorrow? We'll have a day of beauty.

374
00:30:34,418 --> 00:30:38,428
A manicure, a facial, we're gonna have
our hair done, the works.

375
00:30:38,428 --> 00:30:42,987
We're gonna be the knockouts
of the RR. It's my treat.

376
00:30:42,987 --> 00:30:44,695
Yeah?
- Yeah.

377
00:30:44,695 --> 00:30:46,455
Donna?
- Hi, James.

378
00:30:46,455 --> 00:30:48,503
Donna.
- Hold on.

379
00:30:48,503 --> 00:30:50,967
Who the heck
ever heard of diet lasagne?

380
00:30:50,967 --> 00:30:54,931
Just a sec, Daddy,
I'll be right in, OK? It's James.

381
00:30:54,931 --> 00:30:57,612
We're having this church
potluck dinner tonight.

382
00:30:57,612 --> 00:31:03,040
Tell him to get over here.
I need help. SOS. Mayday.

383
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,513
Would you like to come?
- I wouldn't be good company.

384
00:31:06,513 --> 00:31:10,696
I think we need to talk.

385
00:31:10,696 --> 00:31:12,830
I found out some things.

386
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:16,009
Audrey told me some stuff,
and Mrs Palmer saw something.

387
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:18,977
What?
- If you come over, I could tell you.

388
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:21,481
I'll get something to eat,
and I'll be over.

389
00:31:21,481 --> 00:31:22,441
OK. Bye.

390
00:31:33,569 --> 00:31:34,319
Hi.

391
00:31:35,886 --> 00:31:37,382
Who are you?

392
00:31:38,142 --> 00:31:42,732
My name's Madeleine Ferguson.
Laura was my cousin.

393
00:31:43,494 --> 00:31:44,908
James Hurley.

394
00:31:46,252 --> 00:31:49,676
Laura and I hadn't seen
each other much recently.

395
00:31:49,676 --> 00:31:53,313
I live in Missoula.
Did you know Laura well?

396
00:31:53,313 --> 00:31:55,314
I thought I did.

397
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:59,496
Here you go. Your order's ready.
- Thanks a lot.

398
00:32:01,008 --> 00:32:04,300
I'm picking up food
for my aunt and uncle.

399
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,647
Aunt Sarah can't cook right now,

400
00:32:06,647 --> 00:32:10,996
and Uncle Leland is up half the night
listening to old music and crying.

401
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:14,957
But if I was cooking for them,
they'd be even worse.

402
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:21,150
You think I look like Laura?
- Yes.

403
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:24,366
We used to visit Twin Peaks
when I was a kid.

404
00:32:24,366 --> 00:32:27,922
It was great.
We'd pretend we were sisters.

405
00:32:29,222 --> 00:32:31,386
I wish I'd known her better.

406
00:32:32,023 --> 00:32:34,271
It's so sad.

407
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:40,628
Well, it was nice to meet you,
James Hurley.

408
00:32:40,628 --> 00:32:42,762
Nice to meet you, too.

409
00:32:52,087 --> 00:32:54,928
Thanks for calling, Mr Mooney.

410
00:33:03,957 --> 00:33:05,955
Are you OK?

411
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:09,845
Hank got his parole.

412
00:33:11,315 --> 00:33:13,443
He's coming home.

413
00:33:20,367 --> 00:33:22,364
What's that?

414
00:33:22,364 --> 00:33:28,135
No, I don't know what you get when
you cross a Norwegian and a Swede.

415
00:33:28,135 --> 00:33:30,389
Very good, sir. Very good.

416
00:33:30,389 --> 00:33:33,567
I can't tell you how excited we are

417
00:33:33,567 --> 00:33:38,129
about bringing Icelandic investment
to the great Northwest.

418
00:33:38,129 --> 00:33:40,761
Would you put
my brother back on, please?

419
00:33:40,761 --> 00:33:43,774
Jerry, who the hell is that joker?

420
00:33:43,774 --> 00:33:46,617
You're sure that he's the boss?

421
00:33:46,617 --> 00:33:50,492
Make sure they don't start taking
eggnog into the pilot.

422
00:33:50,492 --> 00:33:55,760
Jer, I've got the jet gassed up
and on the runway in Seattle.

423
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,435
Usher them through customs,
make your connection,

424
00:33:58,435 --> 00:34:03,701
and save me some
of whatever it is that they're having.

425
00:34:04,924 --> 00:34:06,553
Yeah!

426
00:34:07,471 --> 00:34:10,312
Audrey! I didn't hear you come in.

427
00:34:10,312 --> 00:34:13,571
What is it this time?

428
00:34:14,744 --> 00:34:17,073
Dad, are you ashamed of me?

429
00:34:17,073 --> 00:34:22,054
Audrey, you're my daughter.

430
00:34:22,054 --> 00:34:26,447
I was thinking about what we
talked about when you were so mad.

431
00:34:26,447 --> 00:34:29,325
It isn't that I'm ashamed
of you, Audrey.

432
00:34:29,325 --> 00:34:32,380
It's just that I wish
I could depend on you more.

433
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:35,474
Especially during
a trying time like this.

434
00:34:35,474 --> 00:34:38,900
That's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

435
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,786
Dad, I wanna change my life.

436
00:34:41,786 --> 00:34:45,497
I've decided I wanna help you
with the family business.

437
00:34:45,497 --> 00:34:48,552
One of these days
you'll need someone to take over.

438
00:34:48,552 --> 00:34:51,097
Obviously, it's not gonna be Johnny.

439
00:34:51,097 --> 00:34:54,445
Oh, Audrey! I wish
that I could believe you.

440
00:34:54,445 --> 00:34:56,951
Daddy, please!

441
00:34:58,381 --> 00:35:00,879
I saw a friend of mine...

442
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:06,232
cut down like a flower
that had just begun to bloom.

443
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:11,332
Life can be so short.

444
00:35:13,221 --> 00:35:16,348
There isn't all the time in the world.
I see that now.

445
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:19,025
And I wanna change my life.

446
00:35:19,025 --> 00:35:21,825
How, exactly?

447
00:35:21,825 --> 00:35:27,087
I don't need college. You can teach me.
I'm willing to start at the bottom.

448
00:35:27,087 --> 00:35:30,440
All right.
We've got some guests arriving.

449
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,533
You go upstairs
and start making some beds.

450
00:35:33,533 --> 00:35:36,199
You still don't believe me?

451
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:40,171
All right. OK. OK.

452
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:43,024
All right. All right.

453
00:35:44,361 --> 00:35:46,359
Where would you start?

454
00:35:46,359 --> 00:35:49,578
I think I should start
at the department store.

455
00:35:49,578 --> 00:35:52,923
Cosmetics, or something.
Part time, at first, till I graduate.

456
00:35:53,895 --> 00:35:56,059
You're really serious, aren't you?

457
00:35:56,059 --> 00:36:00,664
You have to start to think about
the future, Daddy. Just like I am.

458
00:36:00,664 --> 00:36:04,632
The future?
- Our family's future.

459
00:36:06,227 --> 00:36:08,604
Please let me be your daughter again.

460
00:36:15,379 --> 00:36:17,293
Audrey.

461
00:36:38,538 --> 00:36:40,831
Hello, this is Benjamin Horne.

462
00:36:43,009 --> 00:36:45,851
I have to take this, sweetheart.

463
00:36:45,851 --> 00:36:46,691
Oh, OK.

464
00:36:49,614 --> 00:36:51,610
Thanks, Daddy.

465
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:03,906
Thank you, Audrey.

466
00:37:11,349 --> 00:37:13,893
Where have you been?

467
00:37:13,893 --> 00:37:17,823
Meet me down by the river
in a half hour.

468
00:37:17,823 --> 00:37:20,076
And be discreet.

469
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:29,030
Here's a bird. Louis Armstrong.
He's a parakeet.

470
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:33,709
Put it with the others.
- Cooper, Gordon Cole on the phone.

471
00:37:33,598 --> 00:37:37,726
Coop, Albert is faxing you his
reconstruction of the plastic object

472
00:37:37,726 --> 00:37:39,868
found in Laura Palmer's stomach.

473
00:37:39,868 --> 00:37:45,388
He says the marks on her shoulders
are made by a parrot or a mynah bird.

474
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:48,349
That's it. You're up to date.

475
00:37:48,996 --> 00:37:51,921
Take a look at this.
- Something with the letter J.

476
00:37:52,758 --> 00:37:56,349
A poker chip. One-Eyed Jacks.

477
00:37:57,148 --> 00:37:58,895
Waldo!

478
00:37:58,895 --> 00:38:02,535
Harry, Agent Cooper.
It's a mynah bird named Waldo.

479
00:38:02,535 --> 00:38:07,717
Owned by Jacques Renault.
- I'll get his home address.

480
00:38:07,717 --> 00:38:10,683
When two separate events
occur simultaneously

481
00:38:10,683 --> 00:38:13,573
pertaining to
the same object of inquiry,

482
00:38:13,573 --> 00:38:16,873
we must always pay strict attention.

483
00:38:16,873 --> 00:38:19,000
Fellas, let's make a house call.

484
00:38:48,268 --> 00:38:51,894
Jacques, it's Harry Truman.
Open the door.

485
00:39:02,271 --> 00:39:05,279
He's heading around the side.
- Go get him.

486
00:39:13,808 --> 00:39:17,149
Let's get forensics and seal this room.
- Harry?

487
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:21,117
Yeah, Hawk.
- He got away. I lost him in the woods.

488
00:39:21,117 --> 00:39:21,837
Harry.

489
00:39:26,933 --> 00:39:29,477
"L. J." Leo Johnson.

490
00:39:29,477 --> 00:39:32,984
Leo Johnson and Jacques Renault.
- That's our connection.

491
00:39:56,150 --> 00:40:01,238
Nice touch, Leo. Bright red sports car
for a secret meeting. Nice.

492
00:40:01,238 --> 00:40:03,630
If you don't like it, get somebody else.

493
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:06,046
Hank said you were gifted,
I believed him.

494
00:40:06,046 --> 00:40:09,607
But, Leo, your whole approach,
it's misguided.

495
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:12,868
Major career opportunity
staring you in the face,

496
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:17,960
and all you can think about is car wax
and chicken-feed drug transactions.

497
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,728
I'm out $10,000. Maybe that's
peanuts to you, not to me.

498
00:40:20,825 --> 00:40:25,381
You were in business with a couple
of glue-sniffing squish-heads, Leo.

499
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:28,932
The Renault brothers?
I broke up their act.

500
00:40:28,932 --> 00:40:31,779
This is Bernie.

501
00:40:31,779 --> 00:40:36,618
Jacques's back in Canada.
We had a long talk. He's staying there.

502
00:40:37,923 --> 00:40:40,051
Jacques was the brains in the outfit.

503
00:40:40,051 --> 00:40:43,189
Bernie made bail this morning
on possession.

504
00:40:43,189 --> 00:40:48,280
Do we know if the late Bernard
gave you up?

505
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,423
I told him if he ever did, I'd kill him.

506
00:40:51,423 --> 00:40:53,095
Did he?

507
00:40:53,095 --> 00:40:57,693
No. He shouldn't have trusted me,
but like I said, Bernie wasn't too bright.

508
00:40:57,693 --> 00:41:00,911
OK. One last chance, Leo.

509
00:41:00,911 --> 00:41:03,077
Don't disappoint me.

510
00:41:03,077 --> 00:41:04,835
The mill?

511
00:41:04,835 --> 00:41:09,432
Keep it simple. Insurance investigator
should read "arson",

512
00:41:09,432 --> 00:41:12,277
block letters, about six feet high.

513
00:41:12,277 --> 00:41:16,326
The deal as we discussed?
- The rest on delivery.

514
00:41:17,048 --> 00:41:19,591
Three nights, Leo. Green light.

515
00:41:19,591 --> 00:41:22,012
It's that clear enough?

516
00:41:24,154 --> 00:41:26,281
But if Mrs Palmer
knows about the necklace...

517
00:41:26,281 --> 00:41:29,544
How could she know?
- She said she had a vision.

518
00:41:29,544 --> 00:41:32,471
She saw someone take it.

519
00:41:32,471 --> 00:41:34,350
Donna.

520
00:41:35,941 --> 00:41:38,485
Donna, it's not here.

521
00:41:38,485 --> 00:41:42,035
Somebody must have seen us
and followed us here.

522
00:41:42,035 --> 00:41:45,545
How? How could Mrs Palmer know?

523
00:41:46,182 --> 00:41:49,309
Laura used to say
her mother was kind of spooky.

524
00:41:49,309 --> 00:41:52,985
She used to see things and have
these dreams. Laura did, too.

525
00:42:01,396 --> 00:42:05,737
Maybe we should tell somebody.
- You mean the police?

526
00:42:05,737 --> 00:42:09,371
If it was the killer, then he knows...
- The police didn't love Laura!

527
00:42:09,371 --> 00:42:11,670
Nobody loved her but us.

528
00:42:14,061 --> 00:42:16,903
I keep thinking I'm gonna see her.

529
00:42:16,903 --> 00:42:21,245
I think I'm gonna catch a glimpse
of her out of the corner of my eye.

530
00:42:21,245 --> 00:42:25,050
Sometimes it's like I really do see her.
- James, listen.

531
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:28,355
We're gonna find out who killed her.

532
00:42:28,355 --> 00:42:30,903
This is about us.

533
00:42:30,903 --> 00:42:36,121
We have to do this for us,
not just for her.

534
00:42:48,798 --> 00:42:52,721
James, I wanna be with you.

535
00:43:11,871 --> 00:43:15,544
Hello?
- Josie, it's me.

536
00:43:15,544 --> 00:43:20,187
We just got a break
on the Palmer case. I can't get away.

537
00:43:20,187 --> 00:43:23,948
I miss you. I need to talk to you.
- I wanna talk to you, too.

538
00:43:23,948 --> 00:43:28,041
Josie, were you at the Timber
Falls Motel this afternoon?

539
00:43:28,759 --> 00:43:32,598
I have to go.
Call me tomorrow?

540
00:43:32,598 --> 00:43:34,435
Goodbye.

541
00:43:39,848 --> 00:43:43,105
Blow the whistle, Josie.
It's quitting time.

542
00:43:43,105 --> 00:43:46,525
How did the shift go, Pete?

543
00:43:46,525 --> 00:43:50,791
Cut some wood, made some lumber.

544
00:43:50,791 --> 00:43:54,259
I'm so tired I...
- ...could eat a horse?

545
00:43:54,259 --> 00:43:58,691
I make you a turkey sandwich.
- That's fantastic, Josie.

546
00:43:58,691 --> 00:44:02,290
Is Catherine asleep?
- Yeah.

547
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:06,253
Good, then give me
some mayo with that.

548
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:11,985
Josie, how do you feel about fish?

549
00:44:11,985 --> 00:44:14,869
To eat?
- No, to catch.

550
00:44:14,869 --> 00:44:18,336
See, the Fishing Association,

551
00:44:18,336 --> 00:44:22,898
their annual do is coming up.
I'm defending champion.

552
00:44:22,898 --> 00:44:27,871
And this year they're adding
a mixed doubles division.

553
00:44:27,871 --> 00:44:32,798
I thought, well, if you were interested...

554
00:44:33,643 --> 00:44:38,649
What the heck!
Would you like to partner up with me?

555
00:44:38,649 --> 00:44:42,328
Well, Pete, I don't know
the first step about fishing.

556
00:44:42,328 --> 00:44:47,182
Josie, there's enough fishing in me
for the both of us.

557
00:44:47,182 --> 00:44:50,361
Well, what do you think?
- Sure, Pete.

558
00:44:50,361 --> 00:44:53,032
Let's give it the run at the money.

559
00:44:54,042 --> 00:44:57,715
Josie, you're my kind of girl. Here.

560
00:44:57,715 --> 00:45:00,081
I'm gonna hit the hay.

561
00:45:00,095 --> 00:45:04,148
Sweet dreams, Pete.
- Sweet dreams, Josie.

562
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:44,750
Hello?

563
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:48,267
Did you get my message?
- Yes.

564
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,701
Catch you later.
