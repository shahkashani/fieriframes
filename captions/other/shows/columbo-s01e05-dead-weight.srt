00:13:09,402 --> 00:13:12,667
Sir, I'm sure it's just
a crackpot complaint, but I--

153
00:13:12,738 --> 00:13:14,968
But it's your job to follow it up.

154
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,134
Yes, sir.

155
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:21,442
I understand. I've had to do
many unpleasant things myself
in the line of duty.

156
00:13:21,514 --> 00:13:25,348
But may I ask, this alleged shooting--

157
00:13:25,418 --> 00:13:27,750
just who is supposed
to have shot whom?

158
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,345
Well, you see, sir,
we don't know exactly.

159
00:13:30,423 --> 00:13:34,154
Only that the, uh, victim
was wearing some kind of a uniform.

160
00:13:34,227 --> 00:13:36,752
A uniform.

161
00:13:37,964 --> 00:13:39,955
Well, come in.

162
00:13:44,837 --> 00:13:48,705
These young men are from
my alma mater, Lieutenant, M.M.I.

163
00:13:48,774 --> 00:13:52,938
They're here to take away
my military souvenirs for, uh...

164
00:13:53,012 --> 00:13:57,005
permanent enshrinement
at the Memorial Hall.

165
00:13:58,885 --> 00:14:03,185
As a matter of fact, Lieutenant,
M.M.I. is giving me
a testimonial dinner tonight.

166
00:14:03,256 --> 00:14:07,454
[ Hammering ]
They're commemorating
the 20th anniversary of my retirement...

167
00:14:07,527 --> 00:14:09,461
and the opening
of the Hollister Exhibit.

168
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:14,330
Yes. General, do you think
I could, uh, look inside?

169
00:14:15,835 --> 00:14:19,771
Lieutenant,
wouldn't that be a little obvious?

170
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,640
I wanna be in a position, sir,
where I can tell my superiors
that I've checked everything out.

171
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:30,205
They've already started
nailing it shut.
Uh, it's just two nails, sir.

172
00:14:31,284 --> 00:14:35,914
Very well. Gentlemen,
I have a friend here who would like
to inspect the contents of the crate.

173
00:14:35,988 --> 00:14:38,980
Would you open it again, please?
Yes, sir.

174
00:14:50,102 --> 00:14:52,798
Wow!

175
00:14:52,872 --> 00:14:54,806
A lot of guns.
[ Chuckles ]

176
00:14:54,874 --> 00:14:57,672
War trophies, Lieutenant.

177
00:14:57,743 --> 00:15:02,146
Uh, AK-47 assault rifle.

178
00:15:05,351 --> 00:15:08,377
PPSH-41 . Drum.

179
00:15:11,023 --> 00:15:13,253
PPSH-41 clip.

180
00:15:15,194 --> 00:15:20,496
All Soviet-made, and,
as you've observed,
all with their firing pins removed.

181
00:15:20,566 --> 00:15:24,525
I see. They're very,
very interesting, General.
[ Clicks ]

182
00:15:31,611 --> 00:15:33,636
War mementos, Lieutenant.

183
00:15:33,713 --> 00:15:37,149
Lively memories, empty uniforms--

184
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:42,984
uh, all carefully packed,
Lieutenant, for the exhibit.

185
00:15:43,055 --> 00:15:48,015
Oh. Oh, yes, of course.
I'm sorry, sir. Uh--

186
00:15:48,094 --> 00:15:51,655
I'll just put these back in here.

187
00:15:52,732 --> 00:15:55,599
There you are. I, uh--

188
00:15:55,668 --> 00:15:58,865
I think that, uh, is fine.
Thank you very much.

189
00:15:58,938 --> 00:16:00,929
Carry on, gentlemen.

190
00:16:02,308 --> 00:16:06,540
Could I offer you something?
Oh, no. Thank you very much.

191
00:16:06,612 --> 00:16:09,513
Say, you got a beautiful place here.
Thank you.

192
00:16:09,582 --> 00:16:12,847
It's roomy, and it's homey, and--

193
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:14,852
That's a fireplace.

194
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,820
Wow!

195
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:20,450
You know, when I was a kid,
we used to have those
fake wooden kinds.

196
00:16:20,526 --> 00:16:22,460
I don't know if you remember
them or not, General.

197
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:26,055
They had a fan in the back.
And it had a red light and ribbons.

198
00:16:26,132 --> 00:16:29,499
You'd turn on the fan,
and the ribbons,
they would flutter there.

199
00:16:29,568 --> 00:16:32,264
Yeah, they were terrific.

200
00:16:32,338 --> 00:16:35,705
That's funny.
What's funny?

201
00:16:35,775 --> 00:16:38,107
Don't you have those irons?

202
00:16:38,177 --> 00:16:41,146
You know, like you put in a fireplace
to put the, uh--

203
00:16:41,213 --> 00:16:43,704
Oh. Uh, andirons.
Andirons. Yeah.

204
00:16:43,783 --> 00:16:46,911
No. I never build a fire there.
It's too much trouble.
Oh.

205
00:16:46,986 --> 00:16:49,978
Easier to turn up the thermostat.
I see.

206
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:54,050
Uh--
Oh, uh, for show.

207
00:16:54,126 --> 00:16:56,321
Oh, that's for show.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

208
00:16:56,395 --> 00:16:59,330
Lieutenant, I've been thinking.

209
00:16:59,398 --> 00:17:01,889
The person who turned in
that report was right.

210
00:17:01,967 --> 00:17:04,401
There was someone here
in uniform.

211
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,461
Me.

212
00:17:08,107 --> 00:17:10,974
While I was packing...

213
00:17:11,043 --> 00:17:15,412
I couldn't resist, uh,
trying on the old harness, you know.

214
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:18,973
I'm glad to be able to tell you
that, uh, I can still get into it.

215
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:23,715
You know, the report said
there was another man here,
and he was dressed in a bathrobe.

216
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:26,781
Whoever filed that report
was seeing double.

217
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:30,795
Yes, I was wearing a bathrobe
while I was packing.

218
00:17:31,797 --> 00:17:34,527
Got a match?
A match.

219
00:17:37,636 --> 00:17:39,763
There you are.
Thank you.

220
00:17:44,744 --> 00:17:48,510
Hey, that's quite a lighter.
One of a kind.

221
00:17:48,581 --> 00:17:51,015
Yeah, that's something.
[ Coughs ]

222
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:54,143
Didn't you say that you
were gonna send all of your stuff
over to the exhibit?

223
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,518
Not quite everything, Lieutenant.

224
00:17:56,589 --> 00:17:59,149
This has a very
personal meaning for me.

225
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:02,456
It's a gift from my staff
on the day that I retired from service.

226
00:18:02,528 --> 00:18:05,588
Oh. Yeah.

227
00:18:05,664 --> 00:18:08,531
General, uh,
do you mind if I look around?

228
00:18:08,601 --> 00:18:10,728
No. By all means,
help yourself.

229
00:18:14,407 --> 00:18:16,500
Not much to see here.

230
00:18:16,575 --> 00:18:19,043
just a basic B.O.Q

231
00:18:19,111 --> 00:18:21,671
I guess that's why I like it.

232
00:18:24,784 --> 00:18:30,347
Any servants?
just a housekeeper.
Comes in twice a week.

233
00:18:30,423 --> 00:18:32,357
Good night, General.

234
00:18:32,425 --> 00:18:34,586
Oh. Let me get the door.

235
00:18:41,267 --> 00:18:43,258
Careful.

236
00:18:46,305 --> 00:18:48,296
Good night.

237
00:18:52,311 --> 00:18:56,680
Lieutenant,
the bedrooms are this way.

238
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:07,482
Guest bedroom, Lieutenant.

239
00:19:10,262 --> 00:19:12,355
Master bedroom.

240
00:19:12,431 --> 00:19:14,365
General, have you
been here all day?

241
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:17,334
No. I was out on my boat
till about 2:00.

242
00:19:17,403 --> 00:19:20,031
You didn't go out after that, sir?
No.

243
00:19:20,105 --> 00:19:24,439
I was here packing, getting ready
for the testimonial dinner.

244
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,070
Do you mind if I look in your closet?
No.

245
00:19:27,146 --> 00:19:29,580
By all means,
be thorough, Lieutenant.

246
00:19:33,752 --> 00:19:35,743
Extra uniforms.

247
00:19:38,023 --> 00:19:41,254
General,
that's a lot of fruit salad.

248
00:19:42,261 --> 00:19:46,061
Past history-- all to be donated,
Lieutenant.

249
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:49,362
Well, you've had the tour.
Anything else I can do for you?

250
00:19:49,435 --> 00:19:52,233
No, I guess that's it.

251
00:19:53,706 --> 00:19:56,300
Unless--

252
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,309
Unless what?

253
00:19:58,377 --> 00:20:01,904
Well, as long as I'm here, uh...

254
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:03,972
do you happen
to own a gun, General?

255
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:08,679
A handgun?
A hand-- Oh. No, I--

256
00:20:10,723 --> 00:20:13,214
Yes. Yes, I do.

257
00:20:13,292 --> 00:20:16,022
A target pistol.
[ Chuckles ]

258
00:20:16,095 --> 00:20:20,828
It's a funny thing.
I never think of it as a weapon.

259
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,164
.22 caliber Hi-Standard.

260
00:20:23,235 --> 00:20:27,171
Supermatic Trophy model.
There you are. Hmm?

261
00:20:28,941 --> 00:20:31,375
What's that medal for?

262
00:20:31,443 --> 00:20:33,434
Oh,
[ Chuckles ]

263
00:20:33,512 --> 00:20:36,379
that's a first with
the United States Marine Pistol Team.

264
00:20:37,816 --> 00:20:40,114
You know, Lieutenant, uh...

265
00:20:41,453 --> 00:20:44,422
I had this out earlier today.

266
00:20:47,026 --> 00:20:50,553
I was thinking of giving
it over to the exhibition...

267
00:20:50,629 --> 00:20:54,998
although it's never had anything to do
with my military career.

268
00:20:56,201 --> 00:20:58,135
I was, uh--

269
00:20:58,203 --> 00:21:02,731
I-- Oh, yes!

270
00:21:04,043 --> 00:21:06,204
Yes, I remember now.

271
00:21:06,278 --> 00:21:09,805
I stumbled over the crate
as I was looking at the gun.

272
00:21:11,116 --> 00:21:14,711
- That must've been what your witness saw.
- Of course.

273
00:21:14,787 --> 00:21:17,415
Oh, well, there we are, huh?

274
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:21,655
There we are.

275
00:21:26,632 --> 00:21:29,567
Oh.
[ Laughs ]

276
00:21:29,635 --> 00:21:32,798
I doubt if I could--
if I could win any medals today.

277
00:21:32,871 --> 00:21:36,363
I've been so busy for months,
I haven't had any chance to practice.

278
00:21:36,442 --> 00:21:38,740
[ Sniffs ]
Here, see for yourself.

279
00:21:38,811 --> 00:21:41,143
Well, I'm not
a ballistics expert, sir.

280
00:21:41,213 --> 00:21:45,377
Well, take it along with you.
Have your people check it out.

281
00:21:45,451 --> 00:21:49,217
No, I don't think
that'll be necessary, sir.

282
00:21:49,288 --> 00:21:52,849
I think I'm on a wild-goose chase.
[ Chuckles ]

283
00:21:52,925 --> 00:21:58,329
Matter of fact, uh,
I don't think there's much else
I can, uh, look for, General.

284
00:21:58,397 --> 00:22:00,922
Uh, I think
I'll be running along.

285
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,696
Before you go, Lieutenant, uh...

286
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:09,173
just who, uh--
who reported this... murder?

287
00:22:09,241 --> 00:22:11,175
No, I never said
it was a murder, sir.

288
00:22:11,243 --> 00:22:15,236
Well, this alleged shooting.
Who turned in the report?

289
00:22:15,314 --> 00:22:17,305
I'm afraid
I can't tell you that, sir.
Oh.

290
00:22:17,383 --> 00:22:20,443
No, sir.
That's against regulations.
Oh, yes, of course.

291
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:24,011
Well, there's one thing for sure--

292
00:22:24,089 --> 00:22:28,048
that whoever it was,
it had to be some--

293
00:22:28,127 --> 00:22:30,288
some guy out here
in a boat in the marina.

294
00:22:30,362 --> 00:22:33,263
General, I'd like to keep
the record straight on that.

295
00:22:33,332 --> 00:22:36,699
Now, I never said
that it was a man.

296
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:40,136
Oh, you mean it was a woman?
Now, I never said that either, sir.

297
00:22:40,205 --> 00:22:42,833
Well, it doesn't make any difference.

298
00:22:42,908 --> 00:22:44,842
Mistakes have no gender.

299
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:47,504
Well, that's for sure.
[ Chuckles ]

300
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:51,447
Uh-- Well, I want to apologize
for takin' up your time.

301
00:22:51,517 --> 00:22:53,451
Please, don't give it a thought.

302
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:56,283
Good night, sir.
Good night, Lieutenant.

303

a regiment of armored cavalry...

452
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:08,987
Hollister captured the imagination
of the American people.

453
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:12,860
His courage, his brilliance in improvising
in the heat of battle...

454
00:34:12,931 --> 00:34:18,494
his colorful garb --
riding breeches, boots
and pearl-handled Colt .45--

455
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:22,768
soon earned him the nickname
""The Iron Horseman.''

456
00:34:22,841 --> 00:34:26,675
Later as a brigadier general
with his own division...

457
00:34:26,745 --> 00:34:30,408
he distinguished himself
by a daring end-run in which...

458
00:34:30,482 --> 00:34:36,250
out of ammunition
and using only his famous pistol
and a monumental bluff...

459
00:34:36,321 --> 00:34:42,123
he succeeded in capturing
the opposing enemy commander
and his entire headquarters.

460
00:34:42,193 --> 00:34:47,062
Finally, a land mine accomplished
what nothing else could--

461
00:34:47,132 --> 00:34:50,829
put General Hollister out of action
with severe wounds--

462
00:34:50,902 --> 00:34:55,703
wounds that necessitated
his untimely retirement
from active duty...

463
00:34:55,774 --> 00:35:01,303
as one of the youngest major generals
in this nation's military history.

464
00:35:04,115 --> 00:35:07,676
On the foreign scene,
the Secretary of State again reiterated...

And today, you're telling me that when
you saw me, music filled your ears...

for Chinese food thirty years ago....

heard from him since.

About the General.

I didn't tell him your name, you know.
And I didn't tell him where you lived.

to a lot of trouble to find you.

be interested in me for myself?

Oh, no. No, no.
No, I didn't mean that at all.

You're a very individual person.

654

No, what I was talking about
was the shooting. You see, I had
second thoughts about the shooting.

655
00:50:01,178 --> 00:50:04,079
You see, our traffic people, they
picked up a couple of kids.

656
00:50:04,148 --> 00:50:06,446
They were joyriding in a car
they hot-wired.

657
00:50:06,517 --> 00:50:09,611
And it turned out this car belonged
to a Roger Dutton...

658
00:50:09,687 --> 00:50:12,520
and he's a Marine colonel,
Mrs. Stewart.

he was the man that you saw
in the General's house.

glasses, or if I had been drinking.

Well, that's just
part of the job. Anyway...

663

I found out this Colonel Dutton...

664
00:50:30,307 --> 00:50:33,435
booked a passage on an 8:00 p.m.
flight to Switzerland.

00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:37,139
But then, he never showed up
to take the plane.

Well, I-I still don't
get the connection.

667

No, you see, this Colonel Dutton...

668
00:50:42,286 --> 00:50:44,777
he was in the Marine
Matriel Command--

669
00:50:44,855 --> 00:50:47,983

That's a, uh, he's
a procurement officer.

670
00:50:48,058 --> 00:50:53,086
But he had a lotta dealings
with General Hollister.

671
00:50:53,163 --> 00:50:57,497
And he suddenly took a leave
and then he just disappeared.

672
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:04,998
Now, if you could identify
the officer in this photograph...

00:51:05,075 --> 00:51:07,976
as the man that
General Hollister shot--

these pieces would fall into place.

00:59:21,304 --> 00:59:24,603
- Of course, they're way out
of line, I know that.
- Of course, of course.

751
00:59:24,674 --> 00:59:28,610
But you know, they have these ideas,
and it could be embarrassing.

752
00:59:28,678 --> 00:59:32,273
I tell ya, I, uh--
I kinda hate to get into it.

753
00:59:32,349 --> 00:59:37,480
- I mean, a man of your stature--
- By all means, get into it, Lieutenant.

754
00:59:37,554 --> 00:59:39,249
Yes, sir.

755
00:59:44,494 --> 00:59:46,428
[ Columbo ] Well, take motive.

756
00:59:47,497 --> 00:59:51,365
Your construction company got a lot
of contracts through Colonel Dutton.

757
00:59:51,434 --> 00:59:53,402
So did hundreds of other companies.

758
00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:58,066
Yeah, but it seems as though
he was being investigated
by the Inspector General.

759
00:59:58,141 --> 01:00:01,201
And if he were killed, there
would be no way of proving...

760
01:00:01,278 --> 01:00:03,246
a conspiracy
to defraud the government.

761
01:00:04,547 --> 01:00:08,244
Well, if no one's around, perhaps
that means it doesn't exist!

762
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:10,479
[ Engine Revving ]
Right.

763
01:00:10,553 --> 01:00:13,021
Right, that's a good point.

764
01:00:13,089 --> 01:00:16,058
Uh, there's one other thing.

765
01:00:16,126 --> 01:00:19,584
Uh, the morning
after he disappeared...

766
01:00:19,663 --> 01:00:22,154
you went out on your yacht.

767
01:00:22,232 --> 01:00:24,462
Sheer coincidence .

768
01:00:24,534 --> 01:00:29,198
Yeah, it probably is.
But we do know that the body
was disposed of at sea.

769
01:00:29,272 --> 01:00:31,866
Now, I've been studying
the tides, General.

770
01:00:31,942 --> 01:00:35,002
Now, the Coast and Geodetic
Survey's got a book on 'em...

771
01:00:35,078 --> 01:00:39,447
and it shows that a body dumped
off the marina in the ocean...

772
01:00:39,516 --> 01:00:41,984
might carry down
to Marago Cove.

773
01:00:42,052 --> 01:00:46,216
Might, Lieutenant. Might.

774
01:00:46,289 --> 01:00:49,019
Sheer speculation!

775
01:00:49,092 --> 01:00:54,428
Lieutenant, you should tell
your... colleagues...

776
01:00:54,497 --> 01:00:57,955
that they have yet to show any link
between Colonel Dutton and myself--

777
01:00:58,034 --> 01:01:03,336
something that would prove
that we actually met on that day.

778
01:01:03,406 --> 01:01:06,204
Yes, sir, uh, you're right there.

779
01:01:06,276 --> 01:01:11,236
But now that you mention it,
it occurs to me that the night
that the colonel disappeared...

780
01:01:11,314 --> 01:01:15,512
I did see a car like his
across the street from your house.

781
01:01:15,585 --> 01:01:18,748
I don't know what kind
of a car the colonel drove...

782
01:01:18,822 --> 01:01:22,815
but there must be thousands
of them in Southern California.

783
01:01:22,892 --> 01:01:26,953
You didn't, uh, by any chance...

Uh, no, sir. No, sir, I didn't.

786
01:01:35,372 --> 01:01:39,866
- There's no reason to.
- Now, that was unfortunate, wasn't it?

787
01:01:39,943 --> 01:01:41,934
[ Revs Engine ]

788
01:02:00,964 --> 01:02:05,594
Uh, General, if you don't mind,
I'd like to go back now.

789
01:02:05,668 --> 01:02:10,935
Yes, as you wish. I guess we're
about through with this test run.

[ Revving Faster ]

791
01:02:21,684 --> 01:02:26,280
You know, Lieutenant,
I don't see how a man...

792
01:02:27,757 --> 01:02:30,658
with the name of "Columbo"--

793
01:02:30,727 --> 01:02:33,252
Shouldn't he be
more at home on a boat?

794
01:02:38,668 --> 01:02:41,262
Must have been another branch
of the family, sir.

795
01:02:41,337 --> 01:02:43,305
How soon before we land?

796
01:02:44,741 --> 01:02:46,732
Not long.

[ Groans ]

798
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:13,467
You know, General, there is a link
between you and Colonel Dutton.

Really?

of a military man in your house.

Well, no, maybe you better--
Could you just-- Yeah. No, no. Yeah.

804
01:03:47,370 --> 01:03:49,565
Should I take the bag? All right.
Yeah, yeah. [ Grunts ]
All right?

A Colonel Dutton, the man
that I spoke to you about?

Somebody dumped him
in the ocean.

He thinks I shot him.
What I think is unimportant.

812

that you distinctly--

My wife says I can never

Not one question.
Not even a half a question.

I only wanted you
to see the exhibit.

Why?
Look.

861
01:08:01,991 --> 01:08:06,792
In order to understand a man,
you have to understand his past.

01:08:25,081 --> 01:08:27,072
Quite a collection, huh?

01:08:32,655 --> 01:08:35,146
You see that book?
That's a Marine Military Manual.

Do you know the story
behind that book?
No. Mm-mm.

could explain everything to me himself.

Oh. Gee, I guess he wants you
to know what kind of man he is too.

About this book.
There's a bullet in that book.

A sniper tried to kill him.

869
01:08:58,181 --> 01:09:01,878
And that book stopped a bullet.
And you know, he never batted an eye?

870
01:09:01,951 --> 01:09:06,183
I mean, that-- that tells you something
about what kind of man he is.

871
01:09:06,255 --> 01:09:09,622
Yes, that he's a man
filled with courage.

872
01:09:09,692 --> 01:09:12,957
More than a great deal.
I think he has an unusual
amount of courage.

873
01:09:13,029 --> 01:09:15,327
More than you and I,
and more than average people.

01:09:15,398 --> 01:09:17,332
I mean, if was me,
I would faint.

875
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:20,836
I mean, most people would
take time to recover.

01:09:20,903 --> 01:09:23,030
But he didn't.

877
01:09:23,105 --> 01:09:28,236
You see, I think he's, uh--
He's a very a cool man under pressure.

878
01:09:32,982 --> 01:09:38,352
Hey, that's nice, isn't it? Isn't that
beautifully cut? Custom tailored.

879
01:09:38,421 --> 01:09:40,355
You know, I think
it's almost too nice.

880
01:09:41,357 --> 01:09:44,986
I mean, all that concern about clothes,
it's kinda vain, don't you think?

Look at that!

885
01:10:12,255 --> 01:10:16,589
I mean, this man just had
a natural flair for attracting
attention to himself.

886
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:21,426
Sometimes undesirable
attention, Lieutenant.

887
01:10:21,497 --> 01:10:23,431
You don't seem
surprised to see me.

888
01:10:23,499 --> 01:10:27,629
Oh, I was kind of expecting you.
I mean, when I spoke to Mrs. Stewart...

889
01:10:27,703 --> 01:10:29,728
I had a hunch that she'd tell you.

890
01:10:29,805 --> 01:10:32,137
I'd like to know what this is all about.

891
01:10:32,208 --> 01:10:35,575
All right, sir.
I'll get right to the point.

892
01:10:37,246 --> 01:10:39,180
It's has to do with
that duplicate of your gun.

893
01:10:39,248 --> 01:10:41,239
What about it?

894
01:10:42,251 --> 01:10:44,981
Well, I find it hard to believe--

895
01:10:45,054 --> 01:10:47,488
Mrs. Stewart, see if you
agree with me on this--

896
01:10:48,558 --> 01:10:52,187
I find it hard to believe
that a man like General Hollister...

897
01:10:52,261 --> 01:10:54,957
who saved and cherished
every war souvenir--

898
01:10:55,031 --> 01:10:57,431
even the smallest photograph--

899
01:10:59,135 --> 01:11:03,094
I just think it's strange
that he was so careless as
to allow his gun to be stolen.

900
01:11:03,172 --> 01:11:08,667
I mean, that pistol was the most famous
single symbol of his whole legend.

901
01:11:10,179 --> 01:11:13,080
You agree with me, don't you?

902
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:20,714
Well-- [ Sighs ]

903
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:22,781
I don't know what
you want me to say.

904
01:11:22,858 --> 01:11:25,986
Well, if it was me--
if it was my gun...

905
01:11:26,062 --> 01:11:28,394
I would take very good care
of that gun.

906
01:11:28,464 --> 01:11:31,262
I'd have it in my apartment
where people could see it...

907
01:11:31,334 --> 01:11:34,895
and I would keep it polished,
and I would keep it oiled...

908
01:11:34,971 --> 01:11:37,371
and I would keep it loaded.

909
01:11:38,507 --> 01:11:42,341
And when a certain Colonel Dutton
came to see me...

910
01:11:42,411 --> 01:11:44,879
and threatened to expose me,

911
01:11:44,947 --> 01:11:47,541
that's the gun that I would use.

912
01:11:50,686 --> 01:11:52,984
Well, if what you say is true,
I mean, you searched!

913
01:11:53,055 --> 01:11:56,991
- Where is that gun?
- That's what I asked myself.

914
01:11:57,059 --> 01:11:59,994
Where is the gun?

915
01:12:00,062 --> 01:12:05,261
Why not on public display?
Why not in a glass case?

916
01:12:05,334 --> 01:12:07,564
Why not in front of
thousands of people?

917
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:21,882
And after we found Colonel
Dutton's body, anybody else--

918
01:12:21,951 --> 01:12:25,819
you, me, anybody else--

919
01:12:25,888 --> 01:12:28,254
We'd have gotten rid of that gun.

920
01:12:29,425 --> 01:12:31,757
We found the bullet in the victim...

921
01:12:31,827 --> 01:12:36,093
and the ballistics check will
match up the bullet with the gun.

922
01:12:36,165 --> 01:12:41,797
But somehow, General,
something told me...

923
01:12:41,871 --> 01:12:44,431
that you could never
get rid of that gun.

924
01:12:44,507 --> 01:12:47,203
It meant too much to you.

925
01:12:47,276 --> 01:12:49,710
You couldn't even
part with a cigarette lighter.

926
01:12:49,779 --> 01:12:54,273
No, that pearl-handled pistol
was just too tied up in your pride.

927
01:12:54,350 --> 01:12:59,049
Because of your tremendous
belief in yourself, you figured
everyone would accept your story...

928
01:12:59,121 --> 01:13:01,112
about having a duplicate made.

929
01:13:03,659 --> 01:13:07,789
But there never was a duplicate made,
was there?

930
01:13:12,568 --> 01:13:16,732
This, in fact, is the murder weapon,
isn't it, General?

931
01:13:27,249 --> 01:13:29,911
I assume Ballistics has
checked out the gun.

932
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:43,690
That won't be necessary.
All right, Lieutenant.

933
01:13:54,477 --> 01:13:57,571
[ Softly ]
I'm sorry.

934
01:14:24,406 --> 01:14:27,842
What is it with me, Lieutenant, huh?

935
01:14:27,910 --> 01:14:31,505
I seem to have a special talent, you know?
I mean, with--

936
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:34,378
With all the men in the world,

937
01:14:34,450 --> 01:14:37,419
I always seem to pick Mr. Wrong.

938
01:14:39,021 --> 01:14:43,151
I'm seriously considering locking myself
in a closet for the rest of my life.

939
01:14:43,225 --> 01:14:45,523
No. That's wrong.

940
01:14:45,594 --> 01:14:49,189
That's just the way my niece,
Marilyn, felt after her divorce.

941
01:14:49,265 --> 01:14:52,962
Now she's got a new husband.
As a matter of fact, he's a cop.

942
01:14:53,035 --> 01:14:54,969
And they got six kids.

943
01:14:55,037 --> 01:14:58,939
Lieutenant-- I mean, just between us,
would you tell me the truth?

944
01:14:59,008 --> 01:15:03,001
Do you really have a niece?
What kind of a question is that?
""Do I really have a niece?''

945
01:15:03,078 --> 01:15:07,845
Well, do you?
Of course I've got a niece!
My wife's sister's girl, Cynthia.
