1
00:00:09,942 --> 00:00:11,705
How long
do we have to wait?

2
00:00:12,311 --> 00:00:13,937
Until we catch
our bad guy.

3
00:00:13,938 --> 00:00:15,036
Can I sleep?

4
00:00:15,037 --> 00:00:17,081
You can't sleep
on a stakeout, Shawn.

5
00:00:17,082 --> 00:00:18,911
You can eat. You can chew gum.

6
00:00:18,912 --> 00:00:21,781
But you can't drink because if you
drink, you're gonna have to pee.

7
00:00:21,782 --> 00:00:25,016
And the target always comes
out right when you got to pee.

8
00:00:25,017 --> 00:00:26,454
Now I think I gotta pee.

9
00:00:26,455 --> 00:00:29,722
Well, then, Shawn, your bladder is
going to get some training tonight, too.

10
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,624
We've got action.
Now, I want you to stay down.

11
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:37,928
I know, I know, I know.

12
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:39,435
Go! Go!

13
00:00:51,249 --> 00:00:52,341
Come on.

14
00:00:54,385 --> 00:00:58,287
I got you. I got you red-handed,
you lying son of a bitch.

15
00:00:58,623 --> 00:01:02,058
"I don't know what happening to your
newspaper, Henry." You're transparent, Clark.

16
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:03,990
You didn't think
I could nab a liar like you?

17
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:05,221
I can explain!

18
00:01:05,222 --> 00:01:07,662
Tell it to the Neighborhood
Watch Association.

19
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,824
Give the paper
to the boy, Clark.

20
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,399
What the hell are you doing?

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,738
Checking baseball scores.
My fantasy team is killing me.

22
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:20,902
This is the Chief's office!

23
00:01:20,903 --> 00:01:22,502
I know, she runs the league.

24
00:01:23,448 --> 00:01:24,607
I'm kidding.

25
00:01:24,608 --> 00:01:26,341
She's in a meeting.
She won't mind.

26
00:01:26,342 --> 00:01:29,179
Plus, we look really important
hanging out in here.

27
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,720
Gus, have you
tried this chair?

28
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,083
It's a pregnancy chair.

29
00:01:35,084 --> 00:01:36,818
We have gotta get one
for the office immediately.

30
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:38,689
My birthing canal
has never felt so in line.

31
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,558
We need to get out of
here. She told me to wait.

32
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:42,028
For what?
Gus, I'm not a mind reader.

33
00:01:42,029 --> 00:01:44,532
No, that's just
what you tell everybody.

34
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:46,831
I want you to try this chair.

35
00:01:47,704 --> 00:01:49,102
I'm not
trying that chair, Shawn.

36
00:01:49,103 --> 00:01:51,366
I'll sit on
the birthing ball.

37
00:01:51,367 --> 00:01:54,466
I kid you not, that thing is
like a refreshing waterfall

38
00:01:54,467 --> 00:01:56,774
cascading down your vertebrae.

39
00:01:57,114 --> 00:01:58,876
It might help
with your stomach issues.

40
00:01:58,877 --> 00:02:00,313
Who told you
I had stomach issues?

41
00:02:00,314 --> 00:02:01,644
My nose?

42
00:02:01,645 --> 00:02:04,777
The vent in the bathroom? Air
fresheners all over the place?

43
00:02:04,778 --> 00:02:07,288
I'm trying a new medication
for my lactose intolerance.

44
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:09,051
I believe
the problem is physical.

45
00:02:09,052 --> 00:02:12,322
And I think it can be cured
by what I'm now referring to as

46
00:02:12,323 --> 00:02:14,419
the magic springy
bounce-up chair.

47
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,191
Hey, Shawn,
smoothies are here.

48
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,458
Pineapple?
Of course.

49
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:18,625
Thanks, Buzz.

50
00:02:19,725 --> 00:02:21,132
You're having food delivered?

51
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:22,727
They were already
going out.

52
00:02:23,772 --> 00:02:25,706
Oh, boy. I'm telling you...

53
00:02:31,013 --> 00:02:32,070
Wow.

54
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:33,444
What did I tell you?

55
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:37,885
Now, take a hit off this bad boy and
complete the moment, you've earned it.

56
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,053
What do you think
this is, Mr. Guster?

57
00:02:40,054 --> 00:02:43,090
I apologize. This will never
happen again. Give me that.

58
00:02:43,091 --> 00:02:44,182
Boys, out!

59
00:02:44,183 --> 00:02:46,592
What is this, Gus, a smoothie?
You know these things stain.

60
00:02:47,029 --> 00:02:49,656
Mmm. But they
are very delicious.

61
00:02:49,657 --> 00:02:51,426
Chief, would you like some?
That's not my smoothie.

62
00:02:51,427 --> 00:02:53,524
I don't care
whose smoothie it is.

63
00:02:53,525 --> 00:02:55,796
I don't even remember
why I asked you to stay now.

64
00:02:55,797 --> 00:02:57,895
You want us on that case
with the blonde woman. No.

65
00:02:57,896 --> 00:02:59,769
Mmm-hmm, Wintersby,

66
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,240
Wilacheck, Wislerbottom?

67
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:02,936
No, no, it's...
Wilcroft?

68
00:03:02,937 --> 00:03:04,945
No, that's not...
Okay, wait a minute,

69
00:03:04,946 --> 00:03:07,446
were you listening in
on my conversation?

70
00:03:07,447 --> 00:03:09,209
I don't know
if I heard it psychically

71
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,979
or if I saw you walk by with
her and Detective Lassiter,

72
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,815
but I definitely heard
the word "psychic."

73
00:03:13,816 --> 00:03:18,187
The woman, Raylene, said she
visits an occasional psychic.

74
00:03:18,188 --> 00:03:19,623
She wasn't asking for one.

75
00:03:19,624 --> 00:03:22,184
Well, not in so many words.
No, not in any words.

76
00:03:22,185 --> 00:03:26,460
This is a bank robbery case. We don't
need psychics for a bank robbery case.

77
00:03:26,461 --> 00:03:27,625
Bank robbery?
Mmm-hmm.

78
00:03:27,626 --> 00:03:29,328
I didn't read anything in the
paper about a bank robbery.

79
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:30,529
It was four years ago.

80
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,402
So, it went unsolved?

81
00:03:32,941 --> 00:03:34,635
It was solved.

82
00:03:34,636 --> 00:03:36,471
Well, then what does she need
a psychic for?

83
00:03:36,472 --> 00:03:38,602
Gus, that is a perfectly
reasonable question.

84
00:03:38,603 --> 00:03:40,010
Thank you, Chief.
We'll be leaving now.

85
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,606
I'm sorry, I'm
sorry. I'm still confused.

86
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:47,380
Her husband's partners are
getting out of jail.

87
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:51,914
This is a routine warning that we issue
when someone may potentially be in danger.

88
00:03:51,915 --> 00:03:53,653
This is the part where
we offer up our services.

89
00:03:53,654 --> 00:03:55,058
No, I think this is the
part where we leave.

90
00:03:55,059 --> 00:03:56,356
That's a good idea.

91
00:03:56,357 --> 00:03:58,192
But... Believe
it or not, Mr. Spencer,

92
00:03:58,193 --> 00:04:00,255
crimes were solved
long before you got here.

93
00:04:00,256 --> 00:04:03,131
And they continue to be solved
when you're not around.

94
00:04:03,132 --> 00:04:05,500
Oh, I remember what I
wanted to tell you. What?

95
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:06,869
Stay out of my chair.

96
00:04:09,176 --> 00:04:11,302
Bank robbers?
Dude, that's awesome.

97
00:04:11,303 --> 00:04:14,073
We should go find Lassiter and
our future client. We gotta go.

98
00:04:14,074 --> 00:04:17,047
Dude, this woman is on an eternal
quest for a good psychic? That's me!

99
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,016
I'm gonna go find them.
I'm staying right here.

100
00:04:19,017 --> 00:04:22,146
Great idea. Wait ten seconds,
and make an entrance. Drink some.

101
00:04:29,263 --> 00:04:31,127
Are you saying
that I'm in danger?

102
00:04:31,128 --> 00:04:33,495
Your husband's partners
are being paroled today.

103
00:04:33,496 --> 00:04:35,295
I have reason to believe
their first order of business

104
00:04:35,296 --> 00:04:37,529
is gonna be to try
and find that lost money.

105
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,265
But the only person who knew where
that money ended up was my husband.

106
00:04:40,266 --> 00:04:42,273
I know that.
But do they?

107
00:04:42,274 --> 00:04:43,899
Hey, Lassi.

108
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,069
Juliet.

109
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,778
Oh, I don't believe we've met.
Or did we meet?

110
00:04:50,516 --> 00:04:51,812
In a bank?

111
00:04:51,813 --> 00:04:54,216
No, that's not it.
Why am I getting "bank"?

112
00:04:54,887 --> 00:04:56,649
Piggy bank?

113
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,019
Sperm bank?

114
00:04:58,557 --> 00:05:00,888
Doesn't matter.
I'm Shawn Spencer.

115
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:03,154
I am the official head psychic
here at the department.

116
00:05:03,155 --> 00:05:04,627
You don't
have a title.

117
00:05:04,628 --> 00:05:07,187
And there is serious doubt as to
whether you're really even psychic.

118
00:05:07,188 --> 00:05:08,755
I solved the McCallum
disappearance.

119
00:05:08,756 --> 00:05:10,664
And the Summerland murder.

120
00:05:10,665 --> 00:05:12,794
Oh, and I found your keys.

121
00:05:12,795 --> 00:05:14,430
And your badge.

122
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:17,534
Out.

123
00:05:17,535 --> 00:05:18,974
Shawn, where are my keys?

124
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,273
No. Out!

125
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:25,947
If you don't mind, we're a
little busy. We have a...

126
00:05:26,352 --> 00:05:27,909
Excuse us, Raylene.

127
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,749
Do we know each other?

128
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,288
No, we don't. I'm sorry.

129
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,053
Psychic, remember? Sometimes
I can't turn it off.

130
00:05:35,428 --> 00:05:36,985
Do you do readings?

131
00:05:36,986 --> 00:05:38,620
Yes, we do it all.

132
00:05:39,664 --> 00:05:40,755
Full service.

133
00:05:40,756 --> 00:05:44,233
I'm a bit of an enthusiast. I used
to have a regular girl read for me.

134
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,834
Really?

135
00:05:47,372 --> 00:05:48,633
Here's a card.

136
00:05:48,634 --> 00:05:49,798
We're at the
beachfront location.

137
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:52,364
I could put my cell number on the
back if you have any questions.

138
00:05:52,365 --> 00:05:53,671
Any time, really.

139
00:05:53,672 --> 00:05:55,770
Thank you,
you're so kind.

140
00:05:56,247 --> 00:05:57,713
This is a
pharmaceutical company.

141
00:05:57,714 --> 00:06:00,011
Like I said,
we do it all.

142
00:06:00,012 --> 00:06:02,018
Well, I always say,
"A man with many hats..."

143
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:03,713
"Doesn't like his haircut"?

144
00:06:03,714 --> 00:06:06,312
Exactly. I thought I was the
only one who read that book.

145
00:06:06,313 --> 00:06:07,721
It's my favorite.
Mine, too.

146
00:06:07,722 --> 00:06:09,123
Really?

147
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,227
And scene!

148
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,536
<i>I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth</i>

149
00:06:25,537 --> 00:06:28,702
<i>I know, you know
They just don't have any proof</i>

150
00:06:28,703 --> 00:06:31,747
<i>Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend</i>

151
00:06:31,748 --> 00:06:36,184
<i>Your worst inhibitions tend
to psych you out in the end</i>

152
00:06:58,509 --> 00:06:59,736
Dude, what took you so long?

153
00:06:59,737 --> 00:07:02,471
This is good stuff. You gotta
see what happened to this car.

154
00:07:02,472 --> 00:07:04,173
I mean, it was really...

155
00:07:05,249 --> 00:07:06,307
What?

156
00:07:07,217 --> 00:07:08,308
What happened here?

157
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:09,408
Oh, that?

158
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:11,919
Oh, I had a drywaller
come in and take out a wall.

159
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,217
A wall?

160
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,419
This is a rental! What do you
think our landlord is gonna say?

161
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,459
Gee, I don't know,
"Thank you"?

162
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,926
Gus, this place
was way too cramped.

163
00:07:19,927 --> 00:07:21,257
My name is on that lease.

164
00:07:21,258 --> 00:07:23,126
Don't worry, I'll make sure
you get a thank you note, too.

165
00:07:23,127 --> 00:07:26,429
You're taking my name off the lease.
And the door, and these Frisbees.

166
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,866
Gus, don't be ridiculous.

167
00:07:27,867 --> 00:07:30,131
Look, I'm almost positive
this isn't a load-bearing wall.

168
00:07:30,132 --> 00:07:32,867
But if you're really concerned, why don't
you go jump up and down in the attic

169
00:07:32,868 --> 00:07:34,033
and make sure?

170
00:07:34,034 --> 00:07:35,872
What is she doing here?

171
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:39,073
Ah, she's our
first real client.

172
00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:41,981
Actually client?
Hired for the job?

173
00:07:42,251 --> 00:07:44,116
Actual client.

174
00:07:45,855 --> 00:07:46,980
Go on, man.

175
00:07:46,981 --> 00:07:49,922
I have to admit, when I met you at
the police station, I was intrigued,

176
00:07:49,923 --> 00:07:51,822
so I checked
your recent track record.

177
00:07:51,823 --> 00:07:53,293
It's amazing, really.

178
00:07:53,596 --> 00:07:55,392
Well, it's a team effort.

179
00:07:55,393 --> 00:07:57,865
Not really.
I do most of the work.

180
00:07:59,936 --> 00:08:01,733
What can we
help you with, ma'am?

181
00:08:02,305 --> 00:08:04,431
I need you to get
in contact with someone.

182
00:08:04,432 --> 00:08:06,737
Well, tracking people down
is our specialty.

183
00:08:08,477 --> 00:08:10,410
What? Oh, it's not, now?

184
00:08:10,411 --> 00:08:12,605
This one might
be a little tricky.

185
00:08:12,606 --> 00:08:16,047
How tricky? Is the person
out of the state? Country?

186
00:08:16,048 --> 00:08:17,174
He's dead.

187
00:08:17,175 --> 00:08:20,243
Ah, and I assume that's
why you need a psychic.

188
00:08:20,244 --> 00:08:22,313
Hold on. Dead?

189
00:08:22,657 --> 00:08:24,648
Like dead, dead?

190
00:08:25,227 --> 00:08:26,784
Currently being
eaten by worms?

191
00:08:26,785 --> 00:08:29,557
He's actually entombed
in a mausoleum.

192
00:08:29,558 --> 00:08:32,722
Gus, he's ascended to the
next dimension. It's fine.

193
00:08:32,723 --> 00:08:35,598
No, Shawn, I think we might be
at a bit of an impasse.

194
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,136
What exactly do you
need to know?

195
00:08:37,137 --> 00:08:39,537
My husband was not
a perfect man.

196
00:08:40,675 --> 00:08:42,608
He got himself
in a bit of trouble.

197
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:45,145
Okay, I'll be honest,
it was a lot of trouble.

198
00:08:45,413 --> 00:08:47,175
He got involved
in a bank robbery.

199
00:08:47,176 --> 00:08:49,944
He was one of three, but the
only one who didn't go to prison.

200
00:08:49,945 --> 00:08:51,746
Unfortunately, the reason
he didn't get caught

201
00:08:51,747 --> 00:08:53,582
was that he drove his car
down an embankment...

202
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:54,883
Wait.

203
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:57,618
I see rain.

204
00:08:59,593 --> 00:09:01,253
No roads, no.

205
00:09:01,254 --> 00:09:03,887
There was a fiery crash,
wasn't there?

206
00:09:03,888 --> 00:09:05,329
Yes.

207
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,325
What would you
like me to ask, Raylene?

208
00:09:08,903 --> 00:09:11,666
Well, this is hard to say.

209
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:14,036
But he was the one
designated to bury the money.

210
00:09:14,037 --> 00:09:15,904
They were to all meet later
and divide the cash.

211
00:09:15,905 --> 00:09:17,738
Only his partners
were caught first.

212
00:09:17,739 --> 00:09:19,539
So why wait until now?

213
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,376
His partners think that
I know where he hid the money.

214
00:09:22,377 --> 00:09:26,010
If I don't give it to them,
they're gonna kill me.

215
00:09:27,788 --> 00:09:29,949
Shawn, can I
speak to you outside, please?

216
00:09:31,258 --> 00:09:33,055
I guess.

217
00:09:34,194 --> 00:09:35,626
Dude, what is wrong with you?

218
00:09:35,627 --> 00:09:38,755
Shawn, I don't know how to break
this to you, but you are not psychic.

219
00:09:38,756 --> 00:09:40,025
Clue me in
on the problem here.

220
00:09:40,026 --> 00:09:43,034
It's a big problem when the job requires
extensive conversing with the dead.

221
00:09:43,035 --> 00:09:45,297
Gus, what is the question
that she wants answered?

222
00:09:45,298 --> 00:09:46,804
Where is the money, right?

223
00:09:46,805 --> 00:09:49,397
That doesn't require
any actual dead guy chitchat.

224
00:09:49,398 --> 00:09:51,738
We simply trace his last
steps, do a little research,

225
00:09:51,739 --> 00:09:54,370
ask a few questions,
and bingo!

226
00:09:54,371 --> 00:09:56,207
Stop saying "bingo."
You know how I hate that.

227
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,250
Okay, fine. Yahtzee.

228
00:09:58,818 --> 00:10:00,479
We're not doing it, Shawn.

229
00:10:01,788 --> 00:10:03,312
Mahjong. Gus!

230
00:10:09,095 --> 00:10:10,790
Mrs. Wilcroft.
Raylene.

231
00:10:11,497 --> 00:10:12,725
Raylene.

232
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,691
Your problem is
outside of our reach.

233
00:10:16,903 --> 00:10:18,336
You are in real danger.

234
00:10:18,805 --> 00:10:20,864
I'd like to recommend
police protection.

235
00:10:22,408 --> 00:10:23,965
I'm pleased
to be of service.

236
00:10:23,966 --> 00:10:25,533
Thank you.
Thank you.

237
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:32,446
I know they're in there.

238
00:10:35,755 --> 00:10:40,316
Just so you know, I am uncomfortable
with inter-office romance.

239
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,128
I wasn't considering it.

240
00:10:45,197 --> 00:10:47,994
And I'm completely uncomfortable
with the implication.

241
00:10:47,995 --> 00:10:51,661
So, it wasn't true, the rumor
about you and your last partner?

242
00:10:52,471 --> 00:10:54,769
I'm not going to dignify
that with a response.

243
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,773
- This is them.
- The bank robbers?

244
00:10:57,774 --> 00:11:00,812
Yeah, a little worse for the
wear than the day I arrested them.

245
00:11:01,847 --> 00:11:03,211
You caught them?

246
00:11:03,212 --> 00:11:05,305
I was part of a team,
but, yeah, it was mostly me.

247
00:11:05,306 --> 00:11:06,372
That's a big deal.

248
00:11:06,373 --> 00:11:09,146
Would've been a big deal if I had
found the money and closed the case.

249
00:11:09,147 --> 00:11:10,517
Things like that
make a career.

250
00:11:10,518 --> 00:11:12,249
Instead, I got a bunch
of loose ends, a dead guy,

251
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,121
and 3.6 million in cash
that vanished into thin air.

252
00:11:15,122 --> 00:11:18,025
It's funny,
they don't look so mean.

253
00:11:18,026 --> 00:11:19,858
What do you mean "mean"?

254
00:11:19,859 --> 00:11:22,022
They look like repairmen.

255
00:11:22,023 --> 00:11:24,499
Big repairmen, but they
don't look like killers.

256
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,729
Duck!

257
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:43,976
Eyes of a serpent,

258
00:11:43,977 --> 00:11:45,352
ears of a bat.

259
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:48,819
Send us a signal from...

260
00:11:49,026 --> 00:11:50,151
Shawn.

261
00:11:50,152 --> 00:11:52,319
I hear a voice.

262
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,919
Can I see you outside, please?

263
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,488
It wants me to come outside.

264
00:11:56,489 --> 00:11:57,625
Now?

265
00:11:58,202 --> 00:11:59,601
I should go.

266
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,308
Is that my bathrobe?

267
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:12,338
What are you doing?

268
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:14,383
What does it look like I'm
doing? I'm having a séance.

269
00:12:14,384 --> 00:12:15,748
You can't have a séance!

270
00:12:15,749 --> 00:12:18,515
Gus, there are no rules against
having a séance. Anyone can have one.

271
00:12:18,516 --> 00:12:20,885
It's like a garage sale.
Or plastic surgery.

272
00:12:20,886 --> 00:12:22,389
Okay, first of all,
technically,

273
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,187
you need to have a permit
to have a garage sale.

274
00:12:24,188 --> 00:12:26,887
Secondly, you cannot
speak to the dead.

275
00:12:26,888 --> 00:12:30,056
Oh, Gus, you don't
understand at all, do you?

276
00:12:30,057 --> 00:12:32,066
I don't need to make contact
with the dead.

277
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:34,500
No, I need to speak with
all the people in that room.

278
00:12:34,501 --> 00:12:35,662
They're witnesses.

279
00:12:35,663 --> 00:12:38,400
We can piece together the rest based
on the information they give us.

280
00:12:38,401 --> 00:12:40,271
I'm already on to something.
Check this out.

281
00:12:40,272 --> 00:12:43,539
The dead guy was on the lam for three
days with the cash. He had help.

282
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,978
From whom?

283
00:12:45,715 --> 00:12:47,080
I'm almost there.

284
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,784
Raylene?
Yes, Shawn?

285
00:12:55,785 --> 00:12:59,453
I'm sensing the last time he
called before the accident.

286
00:12:59,454 --> 00:13:01,325
Ellen was the only
one who talked to him.

287
00:13:01,326 --> 00:13:03,557
Ellen. Yes,
I feel that deeply.

288
00:13:03,558 --> 00:13:05,190
You didn't tell
the police that, did you?

289
00:13:05,191 --> 00:13:08,498
No, I was afraid. He's my brother.
I didn't want to turn him in.

290
00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:11,562
No, of course not.
Where did he call from?

291
00:13:12,007 --> 00:13:13,837
A pay phone outside a store.

292
00:13:13,838 --> 00:13:16,878
Yes, it was a store,
I feel it. Which store?

293
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:20,139
I think it was a...
Thriftymart.

294
00:13:20,516 --> 00:13:22,949
Up north. He'd been driving.

295
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:26,783
I've always imagined
it was the one near Pismo.

296
00:13:26,784 --> 00:13:30,517
Pismo! Yes, but
the spirits are confused,

297
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,185
they need more
specific directions.

298
00:13:33,186 --> 00:13:35,890
Nearest cross street?

299
00:13:36,265 --> 00:13:38,528
Just past the park
we used to hike with Roger.

300
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:39,999
Who's Roger?

301
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,262
He's our cousin.

302
00:13:43,672 --> 00:13:46,196
Really?
But wait, there's more.

303
00:13:46,197 --> 00:13:50,871
The spirits are asking me.
What is Roger's address?

304
00:13:51,146 --> 00:13:53,079
I really haven't
seen Roger in years.

305
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,377
Come on, Ellen!
Work with me! Think harder.

306
00:13:55,378 --> 00:13:56,610
Okay, sorry.

307
00:13:57,019 --> 00:13:58,508
How about a phone number?

308
00:13:58,509 --> 00:13:59,986
Okay.

309
00:14:00,721 --> 00:14:04,121
Gus, what have you done? You've
broken the chain of spiritual trust.

310
00:14:04,122 --> 00:14:05,351
I didn't break anything.

311
00:14:05,352 --> 00:14:06,790
Don't ruin it
for everyone, Gus.

312
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,157
I'm not ruining anything.

313
00:14:08,158 --> 00:14:10,093
Listen, Raylene,
I have to apologize to you.

314
00:14:10,094 --> 00:14:11,721
You seem like
a very decent person.

315
00:14:11,722 --> 00:14:13,959
But what you need
is protection, not this.

316
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,968
A bodyguard, a policeman.

317
00:14:15,969 --> 00:14:18,300
I can assure you,
there is no spirit in here.

318
00:14:18,301 --> 00:14:19,463
What?

319
00:14:19,464 --> 00:14:21,837
And let me make you a guarantee,
there is absolutely no way

320
00:14:21,838 --> 00:14:23,843
there will be any sort
of contact with zombies...

321
00:14:27,615 --> 00:14:28,809
You okay?

322
00:14:36,257 --> 00:14:38,248
I think that's all
for tonight, ladies.

323
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:48,626
Did you do that?

324
00:14:48,627 --> 00:14:50,363
Why would I ruin
our totally cool window?

325
00:14:50,364 --> 00:14:51,460
For effect,

326
00:14:51,461 --> 00:14:53,505
to make me think
you contacted an evil ghost.

327
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:54,870
Gus, please.

328
00:14:55,408 --> 00:14:58,309
Why didn't you float that idea
by me sooner? That's genius.

329
00:15:01,081 --> 00:15:03,480
Somebody obviously
wants us off this case.

330
00:15:03,481 --> 00:15:04,982
I think
it's those convicts.

331
00:15:04,983 --> 00:15:06,915
But whoever it is,
we'll never find them.

332
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,647
I just saw them run off.

333
00:15:08,648 --> 00:15:10,814
You sure about that?
Yeah.

334
00:15:10,815 --> 00:15:13,416
Ladies, stay here.
We're going after them.

335
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,459
Or it.

336
00:15:16,963 --> 00:15:18,954
Let's get some tacos.
Okay.

337
00:15:20,634 --> 00:15:22,534
And then the window
just shattered.

338
00:15:23,003 --> 00:15:24,799
And you think ghosts did it?

339
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,894
No. No. No.

340
00:15:25,895 --> 00:15:29,134
Though there may have been some women
present who thought ghosts were responsible.

341
00:15:29,135 --> 00:15:31,199
I blame it on the two convicts
from the Holmby Bank robbery.

342
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,074
I'm sorry, I still don't
understand why that means

343
00:15:33,075 --> 00:15:34,942
you need to see
the entire case file.

344
00:15:34,943 --> 00:15:37,881
Oh, no, no, Juliet, we don't
need to see the whole thing. No.

345
00:15:37,882 --> 00:15:41,214
No, just the cover page, one
or two others, here, there.

346
00:15:41,215 --> 00:15:43,481
Definitely the witness list.
Well, you gotta see that.

347
00:15:43,482 --> 00:15:45,785
And the Chief's okay
with this? Oh, yeah.

348
00:15:46,592 --> 00:15:47,889
I don't think so.

349
00:15:48,827 --> 00:15:50,192
No?
No.

350
00:15:56,602 --> 00:15:58,763
I liked the other girl better.
Not me.

351
00:15:59,138 --> 00:16:01,196
Hey, since we're here,
we should do some digging.

352
00:16:01,197 --> 00:16:03,536
Good idea, why don't you dig
me getting the hell out of here

353
00:16:03,537 --> 00:16:04,631
and going to get some sleep?

354
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:08,245
Hey, I set you up for that.

355
00:16:08,246 --> 00:16:10,043
Lobbed it right
over the plate.

356
00:16:21,627 --> 00:16:23,094
Mr. Spencer!
Oh!

357
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:26,059
Hey, you, what a surprise.

358
00:16:26,632 --> 00:16:27,791
You look different.

359
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:30,026
Yes, I took your advice.

360
00:16:30,027 --> 00:16:31,658
Three weeks
without a cigarette.

361
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:33,999
Well, it has certainly
enhanced your aura.

362
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,198
And remember,
it wasn't my advice,

363
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:37,763
it was your grandma's spirit.

364
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:41,106
Have you spoken to her again?

365
00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:45,608
She's here.

366
00:16:45,609 --> 00:16:46,840
Now?

367
00:16:46,841 --> 00:16:48,282
Yes.

368
00:16:48,283 --> 00:16:50,217
Where? In this hallway?

369
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:51,482
No.

370
00:16:53,191 --> 00:16:54,953
In the records room.

371
00:16:54,954 --> 00:16:57,255
I thought I felt
something eerie in there.

372
00:16:57,256 --> 00:17:00,593
Me, too. Unfortunately,
I'm not allowed down there.

373
00:17:01,366 --> 00:17:02,663
Please.

374
00:17:10,908 --> 00:17:12,499
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Not too much light.

375
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,511
You don't want to
scare her away.

376
00:17:16,547 --> 00:17:17,741
Yes.

377
00:17:18,149 --> 00:17:19,240
Oh, yes.

378
00:17:19,241 --> 00:17:21,011
Yes, I can feel her,
all right.

379
00:17:21,012 --> 00:17:22,381
She's...

380
00:17:23,587 --> 00:17:25,679
She's over by the W's.

381
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,452
Why?
No. W.

382
00:17:29,626 --> 00:17:31,287
This is it!

383
00:17:31,728 --> 00:17:33,854
I'm nervous.
Don't be.

384
00:17:33,855 --> 00:17:35,693
I want you to relax. Breathe.

385
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:37,995
Close your eyes.

386
00:17:39,369 --> 00:17:40,926
Why would she be in the W's?

387
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:42,470
I don't know.

388
00:17:42,471 --> 00:17:45,096
Did you know any W's?

389
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:46,436
That bastard Walter.

390
00:17:46,437 --> 00:17:47,771
Walter.

391
00:17:47,772 --> 00:17:50,277
Your ex?

392
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:51,871
Wow! Yes.

393
00:17:53,116 --> 00:17:54,207
I hear something.

394
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,682
Yes, me, too.

395
00:17:55,683 --> 00:17:58,720
Paper.
No, it's not paper.

396
00:17:58,721 --> 00:18:00,551
Yes, it's clearly paper.

397
00:18:00,552 --> 00:18:01,817
You have to concentrate.

398
00:18:01,818 --> 00:18:03,689
Breathe deeply.

399
00:18:06,396 --> 00:18:07,726
No, uh-uh.

400
00:18:07,727 --> 00:18:12,132
I'm definitely not
feeling anything anymore.

401
00:18:14,837 --> 00:18:16,361
I think we've lost her.

402
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,544
I'm so sorry
I couldn't reach her.

403
00:18:24,346 --> 00:18:28,248
It's okay. I know how temperamental
the spirit world can...

404
00:18:28,851 --> 00:18:30,546
Your hand!
Oh!

405
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,709
It was the spirits!
Yes.

406
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,222
It's a message from beyond.
What does it say?

407
00:18:39,528 --> 00:18:42,258
I think I should keep it to
myself. It's a private message.

408
00:18:51,774 --> 00:18:54,367
Dude, you look so peaceful
when you're sleeping.

409
00:18:54,368 --> 00:18:56,410
Never come in my apartment
again. You hear me?

410
00:18:56,411 --> 00:18:58,343
I've seen
the Holmby Bank file.

411
00:18:58,344 --> 00:19:00,974
Look, Shawn, I don't want
to... The cousin is the key.

412
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,543
Which cousin? The one
the sister mentioned?

413
00:19:03,544 --> 00:19:06,177
And then immediately regretted.
You could see it. She let it slip.

414
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,720
Dude, the guy runs a cemetery.

415
00:19:07,721 --> 00:19:10,757
Which one? Oh, I don't know, the
one David Wilcroft is buried in?

416
00:19:10,758 --> 00:19:13,588
I'll bet you dollars to donuts he
knows exactly where the money is.

417
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:15,856
Look, it's all right here
on my hand.

418
00:19:17,098 --> 00:19:19,531
His name is Roger Blaine,
creepy as all get-out.

419
00:19:19,532 --> 00:19:22,660
Lives on the grounds,
alone, no wife, no kids.

420
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:26,400
Not that part. That's the Italian
seamstress I met at the Renaissance fair.

421
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:29,241
How much further
is this place?

422
00:19:29,242 --> 00:19:30,937
I don't know,
50, 60 miles.

423
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:32,709
60 miles!

424
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,303
And you didn't get me a donut?

425
00:19:34,304 --> 00:19:36,247
I did get you a donut.
Then I ate it.

426
00:19:36,818 --> 00:19:38,375
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

427
00:19:38,376 --> 00:19:40,682
Solving a crime? That happens
to be our job description.

428
00:19:40,683 --> 00:19:42,278
No, driving so far on a whim.

429
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:46,417
A whim, he says. A guy dies and
gets buried by his own weirdo cousin

430
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:50,953
in a tiny cemetery way up the coast
in a town with a population of 200.

431
00:19:50,954 --> 00:19:52,521
That is not a whim,
that is a clue.

432
00:19:52,522 --> 00:19:54,190
You think the
cousin has the money?

433
00:19:54,191 --> 00:19:57,668
Roger Blaine? That even
sounds like an alias.

434
00:19:57,669 --> 00:20:00,069
He could've killed Wilcroft. Or
it could have been the sister.

435
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,936
Gus, they're all
kind of creepy.

436
00:20:01,937 --> 00:20:05,136
The dead guy, the undertaker,
the sister, Raylene.

437
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,441
Oh, there's nothing
creepy about Raylene.

438
00:20:07,442 --> 00:20:09,447
Nothing creepy about the
melodramatic widow? No.

439
00:20:09,448 --> 00:20:11,847
Are you serious?
Who marries a bank robber?

440
00:20:11,848 --> 00:20:13,442
Who sees a psychic every week?

441
00:20:13,443 --> 00:20:15,077
There's nothing wrong
with her, Shawn. Okay.

442
00:20:15,078 --> 00:20:17,486
What is this thing you have
with women in jeopardy?

443
00:20:17,487 --> 00:20:20,583
They have a name for this, you know.
It's called the Stockholm syndrome.

444
00:20:20,584 --> 00:20:22,128
No, it's not.

445
00:20:22,462 --> 00:20:23,826
Florence Nightingale's
disease?

446
00:20:23,827 --> 00:20:27,059
Are you trying to be funny? You can't
ridicule me because I want to help.

447
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,124
I can when you want
to help too much.

448
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:32,501
You have an unnatural affinity for this woman
that I simply cannot wrap my brain around.

449
00:20:32,502 --> 00:20:34,540
She dresses like she's
on her way to a PTA meeting.

450
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,405
Fine. She reminds me of somebody
who was very important to me.

451
00:20:37,406 --> 00:20:39,205
Who?
Don't worry about it.

452
00:20:39,206 --> 00:20:40,472
Oh, no.
What?

453
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:41,672
Don't say it.
What?

454
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:44,044
Don't say Meredith Baxter
Birney! It's not MBB!

455
00:20:44,045 --> 00:20:46,549
This is unhealthy. Okay, you
were in love with her, too.

456
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:50,214
I loved her because she was Mrs.
Keaton, and she gave birth to APK.

457
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:51,987
It's not her anyway.

458
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:54,358
Well, who is it?

459
00:20:55,294 --> 00:20:56,419
My babysitter.

460
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,327
Your babysitter.
Yes, my babysitter.

461
00:20:59,328 --> 00:21:01,490
Gus, Mrs. Pilderman
was in her late 60s.

462
00:21:01,491 --> 00:21:04,467
Mrs. Pilderman was 37 years
old and she was a nurse, Shawn.

463
00:21:04,468 --> 00:21:07,994
She taught me things, like, you know,
about books and art. Things like that.

464
00:21:07,995 --> 00:21:10,906
Things like skinny-dipping? I did not
go skinny-dipping with Mrs. Pilderman!

465
00:21:10,907 --> 00:21:12,968
Well, at least that sheds
some light on it.

466
00:21:22,388 --> 00:21:24,412
Huh, nobody's home.

467
00:21:24,413 --> 00:21:25,820
No, somebody's here.

468
00:21:25,821 --> 00:21:27,790
You can see through doors now,
that's the new thing?

469
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,554
I can smell the laundry
vent. No, you can't.

470
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:30,721
Okay.

471
00:21:32,195 --> 00:21:35,233
Oh, Gus, please with the
supersmeller. You have to stop!

472
00:21:38,933 --> 00:21:40,561
Oh, dude, I can smell it, too.
I told you.

473
00:21:40,562 --> 00:21:43,004
Jeans and socks and underwear
and a Bounce sheet.

474
00:21:43,005 --> 00:21:45,564
Make jokes. How long do you think
it takes to dry a load of clothes?

475
00:21:45,565 --> 00:21:48,374
Thirty minutes? Somebody's
here and not answering the door.

476
00:21:49,881 --> 00:21:51,677
Gus, I apologize.

477
00:21:51,678 --> 00:21:53,740
That's very
impressive detective work.

478
00:21:53,741 --> 00:21:56,184
I feel a little bad about the
donut thing now. You should.

479
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,052
Dang it!

480
00:22:00,892 --> 00:22:02,120
Let's try the back.

481
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:21,712
Just stay
and watch. Go on, G.

482
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:33,517
Whoa!

483
00:22:33,924 --> 00:22:35,357
You're not Roger!

484
00:22:36,593 --> 00:22:38,083
No, no, you're...

485
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,722
You're David Wilcroft.

486
00:22:42,433 --> 00:22:44,162
Aren't you
supposed to be dead?

487
00:22:48,072 --> 00:22:49,164
Gus?

488
00:22:49,807 --> 00:22:50,796
Gus?

489
00:22:54,278 --> 00:22:56,678
Look. It's not that easy
to explain.

490
00:22:56,914 --> 00:23:00,611
I'm not a real criminal. I just...
I got in a little over my head.

491
00:23:01,285 --> 00:23:02,512
You robbed a bank.

492
00:23:02,513 --> 00:23:03,848
I didn't want to.

493
00:23:04,254 --> 00:23:05,516
I was in a bad place.

494
00:23:05,989 --> 00:23:08,822
They trusted me. I was
supposed to stash the cash.

495
00:23:16,432 --> 00:23:18,058
You lost the money.

496
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:20,068
Yeah. How'd you know?

497
00:23:22,538 --> 00:23:25,803
It was raining. Really
hard, for two whole days.

498
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:28,941
It was the worst rainstorm
in 30 years.

499
00:23:28,942 --> 00:23:30,238
You couldn't find it.

500
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:32,177
Yeah. By the time
the roads reopened,

501
00:23:32,178 --> 00:23:34,215
every marker I left was gone,
it was washed away.

502
00:23:34,216 --> 00:23:37,081
I lost three and a half
million dollars.

503
00:23:37,387 --> 00:23:39,217
Driving back,
I nearly drove off the road.

504
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:41,152
It was then I realized
I'd be better off dead.

505
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,157
And you have been
digging ever since.

506
00:23:43,158 --> 00:23:45,785
Every chance I can get out there
without the risk of being seen

507
00:23:45,786 --> 00:23:48,261
by hikers or
mountain bikers, I dig.

508
00:23:48,262 --> 00:23:50,925
You know what? Raylene
is in agony over this.

509
00:23:51,401 --> 00:23:52,731
I didn't mean her any harm.

510
00:23:52,732 --> 00:23:54,393
You were never gonna
tell her? I couldn't.

511
00:23:54,394 --> 00:23:56,460
Excuse us a moment.
What?

512
00:23:56,461 --> 00:24:00,600
Gus, what's happening with you
and this guy's wife?

513
00:24:01,043 --> 00:24:02,532
Are you having
feelings for this woman?

514
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:05,340
That's ridiculous. No, no,
Gus. Gus, this is wonderful.

515
00:24:05,341 --> 00:24:08,473
Look, we didn't know he was alive. When she
came to us she was technically available.

516
00:24:08,474 --> 00:24:10,312
Shawn. Stop it. I'm not
hitting on your wife.

517
00:24:10,313 --> 00:24:12,750
No, he's not. But there's some
serious crushing going on here.

518
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:15,653
Dude, I am not blind. "A man with
many hats doesn't like his haircut"?

519
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:16,883
What book is that from?

520
00:24:16,884 --> 00:24:18,515
She's a charming woman.
A charming woman?

521
00:24:18,516 --> 00:24:19,684
Oh, you're Jane Austen now?

522
00:24:19,685 --> 00:24:22,058
She's an adult, she is
attractive, she's mature.

523
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:25,530
Shawn... David, help me out here,
tell him that this is healthy.

524
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:27,624
Raylene is a
very dynamic woman.

525
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:29,293
Everybody is drawn to her.

526
00:24:29,294 --> 00:24:30,837
Look, guys,

527
00:24:30,838 --> 00:24:36,172
I know you want to turn me in. But you gotta
understand I'm close. I am so very close.

528
00:24:36,173 --> 00:24:40,440
I've covered nearly every inch inside
the Kalish trail loop where I buried it.

529
00:24:40,441 --> 00:24:42,038
And you want us
to let you find it?

530
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:45,017
Get her to hide someplace,
someplace safe.

531
00:24:45,018 --> 00:24:47,781
I just want to return the
money and get on with my life.

532
00:24:47,782 --> 00:24:48,845
Hmm?

533
00:24:50,392 --> 00:24:52,360
We have to think
this through. Yeah.

534
00:24:54,496 --> 00:24:58,454
You know, in my mind,
they were the lucky ones,

535
00:24:59,533 --> 00:25:02,331
they got to go to prison, pay
off their debt to society.

536
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:05,561
I've been living
as a dead man.

537
00:25:05,562 --> 00:25:07,401
If Raylene's going to
find out that I'm alive,

538
00:25:07,402 --> 00:25:11,605
at the very least, don't let it come
from a stranger, let it come from me.

539
00:25:13,981 --> 00:25:15,038
We're letting him go?

540
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,082
He's not going anywhere
until he finds that money.

541
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:19,050
I doubt that'll be
anytime soon.

542
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:20,517
He did have
cool hair, though.

543
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:22,418
God, we're missing
something else here!

544
00:25:22,419 --> 00:25:24,013
He's the key
to solving this puzzle.

545
00:25:24,014 --> 00:25:25,284
We need to tell Raylene.

546
00:25:25,285 --> 00:25:28,418
Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're holding all the
cards here, Gus. Why would we do that?

547
00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:30,794
Because she's in danger.
Maybe we can fix that.

548
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:35,758
Your husband, he's alive.

549
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:39,464
Gus! Remember the part where
we weren't going to tell her?

550
00:25:39,465 --> 00:25:40,767
We never said that!

551
00:25:40,768 --> 00:25:42,137
David's alive?

552
00:25:42,138 --> 00:25:44,109
We found him.
He's with his cousin.

553
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:47,346
Roger? No, no, no.
That can't be.

554
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,615
I'm sure your head is spinning and that
you don't feel completely safe right now.

555
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,152
But rest assured,
we do have a plan.

556
00:25:55,021 --> 00:25:57,319
We are gonna put
the convicts back in jail.

557
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,486
Where they belong. And are
gonna stay for a while.

558
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:09,495
We'll put these guys
behind bars, where they belong.

559
00:26:16,543 --> 00:26:19,637
So who authorized
this stakeout?

560
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:21,338
What?

561
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:23,204
You know, who set it up?

562
00:26:23,205 --> 00:26:25,716
I did.
I mean, who sanctioned it?

563
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:27,342
Approved it? Above you.

564
00:26:27,343 --> 00:26:30,249
Above me? You know, I don't
think I like where this is going.

565
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:33,814
I just mean it should be officially
sanctioned as per the police code.

566
00:26:33,815 --> 00:26:35,292
Which one?

567
00:26:35,562 --> 00:26:36,822
11A-17.

568
00:26:36,823 --> 00:26:38,020
Ticky-tack. Doesn't apply.

569
00:26:38,021 --> 00:26:40,427
In most cases someone
still has to authorize it.

570
00:26:40,428 --> 00:26:43,524
Oh, that's right,
I remember now. I did!

571
00:26:43,525 --> 00:26:45,694
<i>Well, what about 42.211?
What about it?</i>

572
00:26:45,695 --> 00:26:47,931
Well, it states that...
It's superseded by 15.75.

573
00:26:47,932 --> 00:26:49,131
Not necessarily.

574
00:26:49,132 --> 00:26:51,436
<i>If you're in the
jurisdiction of a 23.40, it is.</i>

575
00:26:51,437 --> 00:26:53,272
Maybe.
Maybe?

576
00:26:53,273 --> 00:26:56,472
<i>Technically, a 23.40 only
applies in federal cases.</i>

577
00:26:56,473 --> 00:26:57,878
What are you doing in here?

578
00:26:57,879 --> 00:27:00,474
I thought we could share info.
What are we looking at?

579
00:27:00,475 --> 00:27:01,916
Get the hell out of my car!

580
00:27:01,917 --> 00:27:06,616
Shouldn't you be wondering how I slid in and
lounged for two minutes without you noticing?

581
00:27:06,617 --> 00:27:08,716
You're new and pretty,
so it's okay.

582
00:27:08,717 --> 00:27:09,885
You've got ten seconds

583
00:27:09,886 --> 00:27:11,952
before I latch the doors and
haul you down to the station.

584
00:27:11,953 --> 00:27:14,497
They don't know where
the money is. What?

585
00:27:14,498 --> 00:27:17,831
Isn't that why you're following them?
So they'll lead you to the money?

586
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,162
Psychic. It's amazing.
You'll get used to it.

587
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:26,439
Look, the dead guy buried the money and
then lost it, but that's beside the point.

588
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:31,105
I think we can cut our losses, put those
two back behind bars, if we work together.

589
00:27:31,106 --> 00:27:32,910
And how do we do that?

590
00:27:32,911 --> 00:27:36,475
Well, first, we dress up as musketeers
and make a very special pact.

591
00:27:36,476 --> 00:27:39,920
Come on, you've watched them pull at
least a handful of probation violations.

592
00:27:39,921 --> 00:27:42,151
You've been tailing them. You
saw what they did to my office.

593
00:27:42,152 --> 00:27:43,817
They haven't been anywhere
near your office.

594
00:27:43,818 --> 00:27:47,625
They were near enough to bust out my
window two nights ago. No, you're wrong.

595
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,730
You lost them, anyway.

596
00:27:56,407 --> 00:27:57,669
We'll talk tomorrow.

597
00:27:58,609 --> 00:27:59,871
Bye, Juliet.

598
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:15,851
They don't want our help?

599
00:28:15,852 --> 00:28:19,519
Of course they don't. But they also lost
our guys. Did you see where they went?

600
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,122
Did I see where they went? You mean did
I see their car turn right on Riverside?

601
00:28:23,123 --> 00:28:25,462
<i>Or did I see the parking tag
from the 2400 Motel?</i>

602
00:28:25,463 --> 00:28:29,061
<i>Touché! Did you see what
kind of whiskey they bought?</i>

603
00:28:29,062 --> 00:28:31,334
Shawn, please.
Time is being wasted.

604
00:28:38,515 --> 00:28:39,572
This is breaking
and entering.

605
00:28:39,573 --> 00:28:41,513
No, no, no.
Only if we break something.

606
00:28:41,514 --> 00:28:44,450
And then enter something.
Entering is just entering.

607
00:28:44,451 --> 00:28:45,714
I'm not breaking
a law, Shawn.

608
00:28:45,715 --> 00:28:47,187
Look, you wanna save
your little widow?

609
00:28:47,188 --> 00:28:49,156
We've got to find some
evidence to put these guys away.

610
00:28:49,157 --> 00:28:50,624
I'm standing firm on this.

611
00:28:52,162 --> 00:28:54,527
Fine, what about the window?

612
00:28:54,528 --> 00:28:56,325
If it just opens,
does that count?

613
00:28:56,326 --> 00:28:57,456
Depends.

614
00:28:57,457 --> 00:28:59,558
Ooh. Hey, I see something.

615
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:00,693
Shawn?

616
00:29:00,694 --> 00:29:02,100
I might be able to slide
this chain off.

617
00:29:02,101 --> 00:29:03,604
Shawn? Gus, I'm
trying to concentrate.

618
00:29:03,605 --> 00:29:06,664
You might wanna turn
around. What? Whoa!

619
00:29:08,977 --> 00:29:10,740
You guys parked
round back, huh?

620
00:29:19,955 --> 00:29:21,149
Okay, okay!

621
00:29:22,091 --> 00:29:24,355
Was that really necessary?
Were we resisting?

622
00:29:25,294 --> 00:29:27,818
Man, window inspector?
In a motel?

623
00:29:27,819 --> 00:29:30,830
Okay, I lied. I did.
I'm sorry.

624
00:29:30,831 --> 00:29:34,027
The truth is I'm a psychic.

625
00:29:34,603 --> 00:29:37,730
That's what I do. Perhaps you've
read about me in the paper recently.

626
00:29:37,731 --> 00:29:39,636
I've been in jail four years.

627
00:29:39,637 --> 00:29:42,699
You don't have papers?
I thought you guys had TV

628
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,939
and yard darts
and mahjong and...

629
00:29:45,314 --> 00:29:48,977
Okay,
I come bearing a message

630
00:29:49,251 --> 00:29:50,616
from a departed being.

631
00:29:51,086 --> 00:29:52,576
David Wilcroft

632
00:29:53,355 --> 00:29:56,290
wants you to know
that he lost the money.

633
00:29:56,991 --> 00:29:58,355
It's gone forever.

634
00:29:58,356 --> 00:29:59,722
Why you telling us this?

635
00:29:59,723 --> 00:30:01,624
He is concerned

636
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:04,824
that you're going to harm
Rins... Racquel...

637
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:06,656
Raylene.
Raylene.

638
00:30:07,301 --> 00:30:08,598
Oh, that's funny.

639
00:30:15,009 --> 00:30:16,533
That is funny.

640
00:30:16,878 --> 00:30:19,972
Jesse, can you make sure
that we are not disturbed?

641
00:30:24,318 --> 00:30:25,546
You can...

642
00:30:26,621 --> 00:30:28,178
Can you prove
you're a psychic?

643
00:30:28,179 --> 00:30:30,246
Sure. Sure.

644
00:30:30,247 --> 00:30:33,258
You are a bank robber.

645
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:36,319
Yes, you did not like prison.

646
00:30:39,967 --> 00:30:42,799
You are wearing the same pants
that you were released in,

647
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:47,101
and you have packed
on a few pounds since being...

648
00:30:47,102 --> 00:30:50,803
No, look, man, I'm talking
about real proof! Like a test.

649
00:30:51,478 --> 00:30:55,175
Now, look, if you're right,
you live. If you're wrong...

650
00:30:56,049 --> 00:30:58,539
Man, you don't
wanna be wrong.

651
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:02,417
Here's the thing. It's
not really a parlor trick.

652
00:31:02,418 --> 00:31:05,423
No. And I
don't want to cheapen it.

653
00:31:05,424 --> 00:31:07,458
Look, prove it now. Let's go.

654
00:31:07,459 --> 00:31:08,720
What's wrong with you,
man? Move!

655
00:31:08,721 --> 00:31:10,057
Okay! Okay!

656
00:31:13,233 --> 00:31:14,860
How many fingers?

657
00:31:15,268 --> 00:31:17,566
How many fingers?

658
00:31:18,305 --> 00:31:19,932
Are you kidding?

659
00:31:20,273 --> 00:31:22,536
Do I look like I'm joking
around? How many fingers?

660
00:31:22,537 --> 00:31:24,508
We gotta be able to come up
with something better than that.

661
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:26,136
All right, man. Time's up.

662
00:31:30,483 --> 00:31:31,745
Four.

663
00:31:34,521 --> 00:31:35,988
All right, how many now?

664
00:31:37,324 --> 00:31:38,846
Two. Now can we move on?

665
00:31:38,847 --> 00:31:41,154
Because Gus and I
have some questions that we...

666
00:31:44,096 --> 00:31:46,586
Three. For instance,
why was it so funny...

667
00:31:46,587 --> 00:31:47,893
Three.

668
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:50,835
And is it possible...
Still three.

669
00:31:52,605 --> 00:31:55,198
Now it's technically
two and a half fingers.

670
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:57,673
And the guy with the gun
is flipping me the bird.

671
00:31:57,674 --> 00:31:59,175
You can see my fingers,
can't you?

672
00:31:59,176 --> 00:32:01,906
No. No.
Yes, yes, yes, I can.

673
00:32:01,907 --> 00:32:06,850
It's the reflection of the TV bouncing
off the mirror to the water pitcher here.

674
00:32:07,553 --> 00:32:10,579
All right. Okay, maybe not. We're
gonna try this one more time.

675
00:32:15,928 --> 00:32:18,419
Now, how many fingers?

676
00:32:25,671 --> 00:32:29,766
Dude, you need
to stop picking three.

677
00:32:37,448 --> 00:32:38,938
Respect, man.

678
00:32:39,717 --> 00:32:41,082
Gee. Oh, man! That's...

679
00:32:53,064 --> 00:32:54,963
Yep. They're back here.

680
00:32:54,964 --> 00:32:57,159
I can't believe we lost them.

681
00:32:57,568 --> 00:32:59,593
Don't think
that wasn't on purpose.

682
00:33:01,706 --> 00:33:03,502
To Wilcroft.
A hell of a wheel man.

683
00:33:03,503 --> 00:33:05,063
He was the wheel man?

684
00:33:05,064 --> 00:33:07,076
Yeah. You should
know that, right?

685
00:33:07,077 --> 00:33:09,738
Well, Shawn's visions sometimes
are scattered. Incomplete.

686
00:33:09,739 --> 00:33:13,112
How does a wheel man miss
a turn on a mountain road?

687
00:33:13,113 --> 00:33:15,743
I tell you what,
he didn't miss that turn.

688
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:18,151
I bet he just drove straight
off. You wanna know why?

689
00:33:18,152 --> 00:33:21,679
Because he was trying
to get away from his wife.

690
00:33:21,925 --> 00:33:23,825
Damn, you're good.

691
00:33:24,227 --> 00:33:26,319
No, no. That can't be,
why would he be...

692
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,091
We called her the Viper.
Man, she was cold as hell.

693
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:31,531
We had to do whatever she
said, man. We had no choice.

694
00:33:31,532 --> 00:33:32,828
Who?
The wife.

695
00:33:32,829 --> 00:33:35,029
Raylene?
You know her?

696
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:38,005
Well, she came to us,
she wanted to contact David.

697
00:33:38,006 --> 00:33:40,440
Figures. That was
her only weakness.

698
00:33:40,441 --> 00:33:43,376
The occult. Man, she'd stop at nothing
to get her hands on that money.

699
00:33:43,377 --> 00:33:46,313
No, she only wanted the money
to protect herself from you two.

700
00:33:46,314 --> 00:33:47,782
From us?
Yeah.

701
00:33:50,454 --> 00:33:52,819
Man, the last thing
we would ever do is cross her.

702
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,685
All we wanted to do
was get away from her.

703
00:33:54,686 --> 00:33:56,315
Especially David.

704
00:33:56,316 --> 00:33:59,828
Man, she ran him around like he was
an animal. He did whatever she said.

705
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,886
Look, man, I don't know
if you guys got caught up

706
00:34:01,887 --> 00:34:03,727
in the charm
or whatever,

707
00:34:03,728 --> 00:34:06,734
but I'll tell you, man, that was
her key. She could play anybody.

708
00:34:06,735 --> 00:34:09,827
I'm telling you
she is a very dangerous lady.

709
00:34:09,828 --> 00:34:11,930
Raylene was the mastermind?

710
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:16,504
I already knew that.
Because I'm a psychic.

711
00:34:16,505 --> 00:34:18,274
Come on, guys. We should go.

712
00:34:19,081 --> 00:34:21,514
You don't want
to go out that way.

713
00:34:21,515 --> 00:34:22,642
Why?

714
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,285
We got company outside.

715
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:29,013
Is there another
way out of here?

716
00:34:29,014 --> 00:34:31,319
I can't believe I just
crawled through a bathroom window.

717
00:34:33,262 --> 00:34:34,660
It has to be a lie.

718
00:34:34,661 --> 00:34:37,665
Gus, you're attracted to
dangerous women, man. It happens.

719
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:39,833
Joan Jett, for example.

720
00:34:39,834 --> 00:34:41,493
Penny Marshall.
Grace Jones.

721
00:34:41,494 --> 00:34:43,366
Or the woman who played
Pinky Tuscadero.

722
00:34:43,367 --> 00:34:44,838
She seemed so sincere.

723
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,234
So vulnerable, you know?

724
00:34:46,235 --> 00:34:49,174
Yeah! Turns out she's
a domineering snake lady

725
00:34:49,175 --> 00:34:52,372
who drove her browbeaten
husband to fake his own death.

726
00:34:52,373 --> 00:34:55,849
And we, we led her right
to the poor bastard.

727
00:34:57,953 --> 00:35:00,512
Lizzie Borden,
Kathy Bates!

728
00:35:06,761 --> 00:35:08,057
Raylene! This is not you...

729
00:35:08,058 --> 00:35:10,063
Whoa! What, today's gun day?

730
00:35:10,532 --> 00:35:11,692
Sit.

731
00:35:16,471 --> 00:35:19,303
"Just rush in here."
Bad idea, Shawn.

732
00:35:19,304 --> 00:35:20,602
Let her hang herself.

733
00:35:21,242 --> 00:35:22,709
Quiet.

734
00:35:23,144 --> 00:35:28,081
Raylene, I am sensing that this
is going to end very, very badly.

735
00:35:28,516 --> 00:35:30,143
Find me my money.

736
00:35:30,452 --> 00:35:32,248
I know you have it.

737
00:35:32,249 --> 00:35:33,650
He doesn't have it.

738
00:35:33,651 --> 00:35:35,210
I'm the only one
who knows where the money is.

739
00:35:35,211 --> 00:35:37,348
Whoa! He doesn't know
where the money is.

740
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:38,448
Of course I know
where the money is.

741
00:35:38,449 --> 00:35:41,460
Shawn, I don't know what your strategy
is, but you don't know where the money is.

742
00:35:41,461 --> 00:35:44,395
You have five seconds.
One...

743
00:35:44,396 --> 00:35:46,023
Really? The countdown?
Two...

744
00:35:46,024 --> 00:35:47,294
Three!

745
00:35:47,295 --> 00:35:49,858
Okay, it's in the crypt!

746
00:35:50,337 --> 00:35:51,701
The money's in the crypt?

747
00:35:51,702 --> 00:35:54,797
Well, David here certainly
isn't. Think about it, Raylene.

748
00:35:54,798 --> 00:35:57,342
Roger runs the place. It's
the perfect hiding spot.

749
00:35:57,343 --> 00:35:59,777
They can get in and out
whenever they want.

750
00:36:00,581 --> 00:36:03,014
Pry it open.
With what?

751
00:36:03,015 --> 00:36:04,607
With the stanchion.

752
00:36:07,254 --> 00:36:10,120
Apparently those are called stanchions,
Gus, were you aware of this?

753
00:36:10,121 --> 00:36:11,315
Yes, I was.

754
00:36:11,316 --> 00:36:14,154
How did you figure out that money
was in the crypt? I'm bluffing.

755
00:36:14,155 --> 00:36:15,717
This is not a good
time to bluff!

756
00:36:15,718 --> 00:36:17,786
I think it's a great time!
She was going to kill us.

757
00:36:17,787 --> 00:36:21,459
And besides, I've always thought a crypt
was a great place to stash loot, you know?

758
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,469
It's kind of like a vault, I mean, you can
just get in there whenever you need to.

759
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:26,095
She's gonna figure
out you're lying.

760
00:36:26,096 --> 00:36:29,199
Eventually. But, come on, it's gonna
take a while to bust open a crypt.

761
00:36:33,013 --> 00:36:35,344
Wow. Not as long
as I was hoping for.

762
00:36:35,345 --> 00:36:36,677
Help him get it out.

763
00:36:38,085 --> 00:36:40,210
Raylene, please.
What are you waiting for?

764
00:36:40,211 --> 00:36:42,015
That.

765
00:36:42,788 --> 00:36:44,380
Son of a...
David?

766
00:36:48,261 --> 00:36:49,557
I don't believe this.

767
00:36:49,558 --> 00:36:52,495
Well, what are you going to
do, Raylene? Shoot all of us?

768
00:36:52,496 --> 00:36:55,500
None of you are armed.
I can do whatever I want.

769
00:36:56,235 --> 00:36:57,702
Really now?

770
00:36:59,172 --> 00:37:00,434
Drop it.

771
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:04,468
You, move away
from the stanchion.

772
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,040
What took you so long?

773
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:10,343
Shut up!

774
00:37:16,355 --> 00:37:17,719
He does have nice hair.

775
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,383
Yeah, that takes a lot of
upkeep, though, man.

776
00:37:20,384 --> 00:37:22,892
Yeah. You gotta worry
about split ends...

777
00:37:22,893 --> 00:37:24,293
Dandruff.
Dandruff.

778
00:37:25,264 --> 00:37:26,628
It's horrible.
It's awful.

779
00:37:26,629 --> 00:37:28,132
Yeah. Let's get out of here.

780
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:35,605
The Wilcrofts are not talking
at all to our investigators.

781
00:37:35,606 --> 00:37:39,074
We get indications from their lawyers that
they will plead the fifth to all charges,

782
00:37:39,075 --> 00:37:42,580
which leaves me with a
whole slew of loose ends.

783
00:37:42,981 --> 00:37:44,675
For instance,
Detective Lassiter,

784
00:37:44,676 --> 00:37:47,740
could you tell me how you made the discovery
that David Wilcroft was still alive?

785
00:37:47,741 --> 00:37:51,310
Well, actually, Chief, we never
made that connection, per se.

786
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:52,946
We were on a stakeout...

787
00:37:52,947 --> 00:37:54,513
Yes, I see that.

788
00:37:54,514 --> 00:37:58,619
You describe it
as "harrowing and intense."

789
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:01,095
I'm sorry,
those were my words.

790
00:38:01,633 --> 00:38:02,860
You wanted me
to spell-check it.

791
00:38:02,861 --> 00:38:05,527
I still don't understand how that
connected you to David Wilcroft.

792
00:38:05,528 --> 00:38:08,071
Well, that's where we come in,
Chief, some good work was done...

793
00:38:08,072 --> 00:38:09,834
By Detective Lassiter.

794
00:38:10,709 --> 00:38:12,073
He was amazing.

795
00:38:12,074 --> 00:38:14,303
He figured out there was
a connection to Roger Blaine,

796
00:38:14,304 --> 00:38:17,211
the cousin, who was involved
with the faking of the death.

797
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:22,411
Burnt body, no DNA, pretty
convenient, he deducted.

798
00:38:22,412 --> 00:38:24,009
I never said that.

799
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,578
No, but you thought it.
That's how good you are, Lassy.

800
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:30,387
You practically solved this entire case
up here without uttering a spoken word.

801
00:38:30,388 --> 00:38:33,918
I did nothing of the kind. I was following
the money and protecting Raylene.

802
00:38:33,919 --> 00:38:35,521
Who turned out
to be the dangerous one.

803
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:38,795
Which I picked up from Detective
Lassiter's massive brain.

804
00:38:38,796 --> 00:38:40,028
Not true.

805
00:38:40,029 --> 00:38:41,832
True.
Not.

806
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:43,030
It was so!

807
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:44,438
Gentlemen, please.

808
00:38:44,942 --> 00:38:47,103
So we still have no idea
where the money is?

809
00:38:47,945 --> 00:38:51,209
I got nothing from him. But if he figures
anything out I'll be the first to know.

810
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:52,646
Would you excuse us
for a moment?

811
00:38:52,647 --> 00:38:54,843
We're going to have
a private conversation.

812
00:38:55,152 --> 00:38:56,778
I know what you're doing.

813
00:38:56,779 --> 00:38:59,286
Giving you credit? You're trying
to get me to admit you're psychic.

814
00:38:59,287 --> 00:39:01,256
You've already done that.
No, I haven't.

815
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:04,217
You're right. I'm sorry,
you didn't actually say it.

816
00:39:04,218 --> 00:39:09,129
Spencer, no matter what you do, I
will never, never ever say those words.

817
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:10,495
Which words?

818
00:39:10,496 --> 00:39:11,759
You know which words.

819
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,268
No, man, I lost my train
of thought. Which words?

820
00:39:18,341 --> 00:39:19,091
Oh,

821
00:39:19,876 --> 00:39:21,468
that you think
I'm a psychic.

822
00:39:22,912 --> 00:39:24,105
Those words?

823
00:39:24,106 --> 00:39:25,840
So when are you going to
tell them where the money is?

824
00:39:25,841 --> 00:39:27,347
I don't know
where the money is.

825
00:39:27,348 --> 00:39:32,286
Sure you do.
You're seeing dirt.

826
00:39:33,256 --> 00:39:34,951
Am I right?
No!

827
00:39:35,725 --> 00:39:37,488
What am I going to say now?

828
00:39:53,009 --> 00:39:54,134
What are we doing here?

829
00:39:54,135 --> 00:39:57,076
It's Saturday, I thought
we'd get some fresh air.

830
00:39:57,077 --> 00:39:59,545
We drove an hour out of town
to get some fresh air?

831
00:39:59,546 --> 00:40:01,138
Well, there's that,

832
00:40:07,122 --> 00:40:10,215
and we're gonna find the dread
pirate Wilcroft's dirty booty.

833
00:40:10,216 --> 00:40:12,452
Shawn, the guy's been digging
for four years.

834
00:40:12,453 --> 00:40:13,891
We're gonna find it
in one afternoon?

835
00:40:13,892 --> 00:40:15,656
Ninety minutes. Tops.

836
00:40:15,657 --> 00:40:18,528
And I brought some chicken
for a hearty snack.

837
00:40:18,529 --> 00:40:19,998
And how do you
plan on finding it?

838
00:40:19,999 --> 00:40:23,901
Well, he said he dug every inch of the
Kalish Loop after he buried it here. Right?

839
00:40:23,902 --> 00:40:25,529
Yes. Three miles' worth.

840
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:27,403
But it was dark
and it had rained.

841
00:40:27,404 --> 00:40:30,535
And he said he thought it was right
off the path, he may have gotten lost.

842
00:40:30,536 --> 00:40:31,635
I heard the story, Shawn.

843
00:40:31,636 --> 00:40:36,343
Did he realize there's a J.
Kalish and an L. Kalish trail?

844
00:40:37,586 --> 00:40:40,053
Dude, it's completely defunct.
Check it out,

845
00:40:40,054 --> 00:40:44,956
only used by the rangers for back fires,
medical access, mud slide emergency routes,

846
00:40:44,957 --> 00:40:48,223
like, for instance,
during a torrential rainstorm.

847
00:40:48,597 --> 00:40:51,963
Otherwise, it's gated and it looks
completely abandoned from the road.

848
00:40:52,967 --> 00:40:55,936
Okay, I find it,
I get credit.

849
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,173
I'm the psychic,
I have to get a vibration.

850
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,707
"Chief?" "Yes?"

851
00:41:04,145 --> 00:41:07,239
"I'm getting
a trailhead, a pathway.

852
00:41:07,782 --> 00:41:10,409
"And something else."
"What is it?"

853
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:11,745
"Chicken bones.

854
00:41:11,746 --> 00:41:13,684
"Yes, tandoori style.

855
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:17,190
"Fresh!" "Oh, I bet
they were delicious."

856
00:41:18,125 --> 00:41:19,319
"Yes."

857
00:41:27,835 --> 00:41:31,463
<i>In between the lines
there's a lot of obscurity</i>

858
00:41:31,464 --> 00:41:34,905
<i>I'm not inclined
to resign to maturity</i>

859
00:41:34,906 --> 00:41:38,169
<i>If it's all right
then you're all wrong</i>

860
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:41,476
<i>But why bounce around
to the same damn song?</i>

861
00:41:43,116 --> 00:41:47,052
<i>You'd rather run
when you can't crawl</i>

862
00:41:49,289 --> 00:41:52,724
<i>I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth</i>

863
00:41:52,725 --> 00:41:55,885
<i>I know, you know
They just don't have any proof</i>

864
00:41:55,886 --> 00:41:59,226
<i>Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend</i>

865
00:41:59,227 --> 00:42:03,234
<i>Your worst inhibitions tend
to psych you out in the end</i>

866
00:42:03,235 --> 00:42:05,168
<i>I know, you know</i>

867
00:42:06,806 --> 00:42:08,671
<i>I know, you know</i>
