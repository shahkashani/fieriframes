Look around you.

2
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,072
Look around you.

3
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,359
Just look around you.

00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,480
Have you worked out
what we're looking for?

6
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,876
Correct. The answer is...

7
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,317
This programme, "Music",

8
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,314
can be found in chapter 9
of your textbook,

9
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,676
which accompanies this series.

10
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,829
Please ensure that you have
your copybook at hand,

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,879
as you'll be asked
to take down notes from the screen

12
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,555
at various points
throughout the programme.

13
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,232
Music is the name given

14
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,869
to any sequence of notes
designed by man,

15
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,238
and increasingly by women,
to effect mood change.

16
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,509
From the oom.pah.pah
of a traditional brass band

17
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,835
to the sounds of pop groups like
The Bensons or The Ombudsmen,

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,517
music permeates our lives
like no other force on earth.

19
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,674
But is it just man
that makes music?

20
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,877
It's a controversial issue,

21
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,032
because there are those
who actually believe

22
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,192
that this is music.

23
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,352
(TRILLS)

24
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,757
They call it birdsong,
but it's hardly a song.

25
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,310
There's no real tune to speak of,

26
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,837
just a random cacophony
of squawks and chirrups.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,912
What a racket!

28
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,878
(SINGS FOLK SONG)

29
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,391
But regardless
of who creates our music,

30
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,394
it has the power to uplift us,
unite us,

31
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,598
filling our hearts
with laughter and joy.

32
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,276
One can only imagine a world
without music,

33
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,799
although we'd probably
get used to it after a while.

34
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,920
But for the moment at least,
music is here to stay.

35
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,637
An experiment was carried out

36
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,759
to demonstrate
how a modern song is composed.

37
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,560
Here's a state.of.the.art
songwriting computer,

38
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,313
the Harrington 1200.

39
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,520
You've probably never seen one
because it costs almost L1,000.

40
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,999
The Harrington 1200
compromises of keyboard,

41
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,234
console and banks
of oscillators and modulators.

42
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,951
But it's at the heart
of the Harrington

43
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,034
that we find the musical motors
that power this machine:

44
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,035
DNA samples taken from the
composers Gilbert and Sullivan.

45
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,999
This is Jack Morgan,

46
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,073
the scientist
who will be operating the machine.

47
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,477
He starts by informing
the Harrington of the song's key.

48
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,034
S.

49
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,477
It's in the key of S.
Write that down.

50
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,360
Next, the song's tempo.

51
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,077
Quite fast.

52
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,995
Finally, the scientist
must think of a title for the song.

53
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,836
He scans his surroundings,
looking for inspiration.

54
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,717
"Little Mouse."

55
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,230
"Little Mouse."
It's a catchy title. Write it down.

56
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,352
The Harrington 1200 gets composing.

57
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,273
(ELECTRONIC NOODLING)

58
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,551
And a few moments later,
the song is written.

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,313
And we can now all listen to
Jack Morgan's song, "Little Mouse".

That was "Little Mouse" there,
by Jack Morgan.

80
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,117
Who knows,
he may have a hit on his hands.

81
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,638
And from all of us here
at "Look Around You",

82
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,996
we wish Jack the best of luck.

An ordinary piano.

84
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,951
And if we go to the top
of the scale, we find this,

85
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,999
which houses the nineteen
forbidden notes.

86
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,597
The box is kept locked,
and for good reason.

87
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,357
We're going to show you just why

88
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,718
you should never attempt to play
any of these notes.

89
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,872
In the interests of safety,

90

And Partario.

96

We're going to be giving them
a brief musical quiz.

97
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,591
You can join in too,
so have your copybooks ready.

98
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,834
Helen, how many notes are there
in a scale?

99
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,076
. Eight.
. Correct.

100
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,199
Rosy, how long
is a standard trombone?

101
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,114
. Extended or contracted?
. Contracted.

102
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,432
. 32 inches.
. Correct. Partario.

under your chin. What am I?

00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,319
Helen or Rosy?

107
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,190
. Is it a viola?
. Correct. Bonus point.

Fingers on buzzers.

109
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,873
Who have better singing voices,
men or women?

110
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,160
Rosy?

111
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,631
. Women.
. No, it's men. Popular music.

112
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,079
Which group had a number one hit
with "The Scarecrow Song"?

113
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,311
Helen?

114
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,312
. The Beatles?
. Correct.

115
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,154
What town was Schubert built in?

116
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,392
What town was Schubert built in?

117
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,800
No one?

118
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,671
Schubert was born in Vienna.

119
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,309
That's the end of the quiz,

120
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,472
and we see that Rosy is the winner.

121
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,518
How did you fare?

122
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,072
Now we present Rosy with her prize,
a beautiful 17th.century harp.

123
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,880
But the others don' t go away
empty.handed.

124
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:12,080
They receive a consolation prize
of a "Look Around You" pencil.

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,919
Over the course of this module,

126
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,720
we've learnt a lot about music
and its many forms.

127
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,157
You may be thinking
of a career in music.

128
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,312
It's an exciting opportunity,

129
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,120
and could be
a very rewarding endeavour.
