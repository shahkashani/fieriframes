1
00:01:56,827 --> 00:01:59,455
Diane, it is 4:28 am.

2
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:05,306
I've just been woken up by a God-awful
racket which you can probably hear.

3
00:02:06,944 --> 00:02:08,655
Can you hear that?

4
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:14,503
Up until now, I've had only pleasant,
courteous service at this hotel.

5
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,561
It proves that once a traveller
leaves home,

6
00:02:17,772 --> 00:02:20,483
he loses almost 100% of his ability

7
00:02:20,483 --> 00:02:22,577
to control his environment.

8
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:26,918
Send two pairs of those silicon earplugs

9
00:02:27,178 --> 00:02:29,177
I used on my trip to New York.

10
00:02:29,435 --> 00:02:33,110
I didn't bring them because
I felt it was unnecessary.

11
00:02:33,325 --> 00:02:34,905
However...

12
00:02:50,589 --> 00:02:53,466
Coffee?
- Please.

13
00:02:54,562 --> 00:02:59,151
What's with the choir practice?
- Business junket. From Iceland.

14
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,413
Got in about 3:00 this morning.

15
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:05,462
They're on my floor.
- Lucky you.

16
00:03:05,462 --> 00:03:09,063
It'll take them a day to reset
their biological clocks.

17
00:03:09,277 --> 00:03:11,774
Hope the herring holds out.

18
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,841
How are you?

19
00:03:18,518 --> 00:03:23,274
Audrey, to be perfectly honest,
I'm tired and a little on edge.

20
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:30,764
I got a job.
- Good for you.

21
00:03:30,764 --> 00:03:34,899
Now I can help you with your case.
Guess where I'm gonna...

22
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:39,168
You'll have to excuse me.
I'm late, I only have time for coffee.

23
00:03:39,421 --> 00:03:41,334
Maybe I could go with you.

24
00:03:41,334 --> 00:03:45,725
Wednesdays were usually a school day
when I was your age.

25
00:03:47,615 --> 00:03:50,325
I can't believe
you were ever my age.

26
00:03:50,325 --> 00:03:53,423
I've got the pictures to prove it.

27
00:03:53,423 --> 00:03:56,685
How old are you?
- 18.

28
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,770
We'll see you later, Audrey.

29
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,908
See you later.

30
00:04:05,424 --> 00:04:06,922
Bye.

31
00:04:07,723 --> 00:04:11,064
See you later, sons of Odin.
How do you say that?

32
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,342
My brother'll love you guys.

33
00:04:27,413 --> 00:04:33,050
Brother Ben, I bring you greetings
from the treeless tundra of Iceland.

34
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:37,689
We have had complaints
from nearly every guest in the hotel.

35
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:39,446
What are they on?

36
00:04:39,663 --> 00:04:42,920
They are insane
for the Ghostwood Estates project.

37
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:47,009
I have had serious fun
with these Nordic animals.

38
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,073
And, Ben, I'm in love.
Her name is Heba.

39
00:04:50,281 --> 00:04:55,086
She's a giant snow queen with a smile
like a sunrise on an ice floe.

40
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,760
You'd go blind looking at this girl.
Look!

41
00:04:58,684 --> 00:05:01,015
See what she gave me?
A leg of lamb.

42
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:03,363
Is that beautiful?
- Jerry!

43
00:05:03,363 --> 00:05:07,041
Some garlic, some fresh mint.
That's rotisserie heaven.

44
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:11,725
You gotta meet her.
- Just grab some downtime, will you?

45
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:17,073
We've laid in a gala reception
for your fair-haired boys tonight.

46
00:05:17,288 --> 00:05:21,627
Twin Peaks' best and brightest.
- Holding it in a phone booth?

47
00:05:21,627 --> 00:05:26,150
And if we still need a kicker to nail
the sale, I'm thinking maybe...

48
00:05:26,362 --> 00:05:30,749
they might enjoy
a little road trip up to...

49
00:05:31,002 --> 00:05:32,797
you know where.

50
00:05:32,797 --> 00:05:37,394
Jacks! I am honoured to know you.

51
00:05:40,742 --> 00:05:42,121
Ben?

52
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,754
Leland, why are you here?

53
00:05:44,754 --> 00:05:49,096
I know there's a new investment group
arriving today.

54
00:05:49,312 --> 00:05:51,190
If there's anything I can do?

55
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,618
Leland, the best thing
that you can do...

56
00:05:54,831 --> 00:05:57,708
is follow the doctor's orders.
You need rest.

57
00:05:57,966 --> 00:06:00,512
I just feel...

58
00:06:01,352 --> 00:06:05,111
I just feel I need something
to occupy my mind.

59
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:10,962
Take some time off,
for God's sake.

60
00:06:11,177 --> 00:06:13,425
Fly somewhere. Take Sarah.

61
00:06:13,686 --> 00:06:17,277
I'm afraid to, Ben. I'm afraid.

62
00:06:21,337 --> 00:06:25,343
Hawk, we're at Jacques Renault's
apartment. Get here soon.

63
00:06:26,493 --> 00:06:30,202
Morning.
What have you got, Harry?

64
00:06:30,202 --> 00:06:34,602
Renault's a Canadian national.
He worked the lumber fields...

65
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:38,320
until he put on a little weight
a couple of seasons ago.

66
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,703
Now he tends bar at the Roadhouse.

67
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:44,501
Are there any more doughnuts?
- Sure. Andy?

68
00:06:45,892 --> 00:06:49,648
And a cup of Joe. I didn't get
too much sleep last night.

69
00:06:49,648 --> 00:06:51,526
You do look a bit peaked.

70
00:06:51,526 --> 00:06:55,201
There's a group of insane men
staying on my floor.

71
00:06:55,422 --> 00:06:56,969
Jacques Renault turn up?

72
00:06:57,178 --> 00:07:00,601
No one's seen him.
We checked the building and the bar.

73
00:07:00,815 --> 00:07:05,870
I sent Hawk to roust his brother,
but it looks like Bernie's jumped bail.

74
00:07:06,082 --> 00:07:08,841
Morning, Agent Cooper.
- Morning, Doc.

75
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:12,469
The blood on the shirt you found here
is AB negative.

76
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:14,603
It's not Laura's blood.

77
00:07:14,603 --> 00:07:18,281
So, it was Renault's blood
on Leo Johnson's shirt.

78
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,849
Thank you, Andy.

79
00:07:33,048 --> 00:07:36,806
What about Leo Johnson?
- The APB went out. Nothing yet.

80
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,813
Harry, could you give me
a leg up here?

81
00:07:40,072 --> 00:07:43,830
Sure.
- What's Renault's blood type?

82
00:07:48,182 --> 00:07:51,892
Renault's blood is AB negative.
- Thanks, Doc.

83
00:07:51,892 --> 00:07:53,948
My pleasure.

84
00:07:55,664 --> 00:08:00,006
Holy smoke! "Flesh World" again.
- Yeah.

85
00:08:01,561 --> 00:08:04,319
Harry, remember that ad
with Ronnette Pulaski?

86
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:08,910
We traced it. It came to the magazine
in a plain envelope. No name.

87
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:11,005
The magazine's a clearing-house.

88
00:08:11,005 --> 00:08:15,052
Readers write letters in response
to the ads and mail them in.

89
00:08:15,273 --> 00:08:21,076
The magazine forwards them
to the advertisers. No direct contact.

90
00:08:22,214 --> 00:08:24,841
Ronnette got letters at this PO box.

91
00:08:24,841 --> 00:08:26,351
A local zip code.

92
00:08:26,351 --> 00:08:32,160
My guess is this box will be registered
under the name Jacques Renault.

93
00:08:32,414 --> 00:08:36,718
Let's see who was writing
to Ronnette. Postmarked Georgia.

94
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:42,320
Goodnight.

95
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:46,335
I don't know, the beard ruins
the effect of the lingerie.

96
00:08:46,555 --> 00:08:48,351
What do you think?

97
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,909
The guy's no Georgia peach.
- Poor bastard.

98
00:08:54,164 --> 00:08:58,338
Did you notice the picture
of Leo Johnson's truck on that page?

99
00:09:08,796 --> 00:09:12,471
I love it when you cook for me.
- Leo hates my cooking.

100
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,402
Leo missed the boat with you, baby.

101
00:09:16,655 --> 00:09:21,876
The biggest mistake of your life was
dropping out of school to marry him.

102
00:09:24,013 --> 00:09:27,141
What would you do
if he walked in right now?

103
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,356
Come here.

104
00:09:32,165 --> 00:09:34,163
Come here.

105
00:09:40,361 --> 00:09:43,987
Hey, Leo! How's it going, man?

106
00:09:44,248 --> 00:09:45,876
What a surprise!

107
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:50,765
Now, Leo, Shelly tells me
that you don't like her cooking.

108
00:09:50,979 --> 00:09:53,273
Tell you what, she and I...

109
00:09:53,488 --> 00:09:58,410
we're going to sit here while you
cook breakfast for us, you hump.

110
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:04,479
If you so much as utter
one harsh syllable to this...

111
00:10:04,734 --> 00:10:07,492
beautiful girl...

112
00:10:07,744 --> 00:10:10,704
I'm gonna shoot
your ugly face off, OK?

113
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,015
Sheriff's deputy.

114
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:20,404
Do exactly what we said,
and everything's gonna be fine.

115
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:21,867
Come here.

116
00:10:34,374 --> 00:10:37,132
Hi, Andy. Come on in.
- Hi, Shelly.

117
00:10:37,384 --> 00:10:39,465
Do you know when Leo's back?

118
00:10:39,725 --> 00:10:43,184
Is he in trouble?
- We just want to talk to him.

119
00:10:43,445 --> 00:10:47,120
Is this about Laura?
- Why do you say that?

120
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,619
I heard him talking to Jacques
the night he left.

121
00:10:49,702 --> 00:10:51,200
Jacques Renault?

122
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:55,044
Yeah. They were outside arguing.
I couldn't hear exactly, but...

123
00:10:55,305 --> 00:10:57,932
they did seem
to be arguing about her.

124
00:10:58,147 --> 00:11:04,033
Call us if he gets in touch.
- OK, I will. Thanks for stopping by.

125
00:11:11,651 --> 00:11:14,613
How'd I do?
- You did great.

126
00:11:18,173 --> 00:11:20,504
You drive me crazy.

127
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,672
Hello?

128
00:11:31,384 --> 00:11:35,344
Hi, Leo. Where you calling from?
- Has anybody come by?

129
00:11:35,565 --> 00:11:38,573
What's that?
Is anybody looking for you?

130
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:42,119
Why would anyone look for you?
- Are you sure?

131
00:11:42,338 --> 00:11:45,964
You know how paranoid you get
after popping bennies.

132
00:11:46,184 --> 00:11:48,860
When are you coming home?
- Soon. You OK?

133
00:11:49,068 --> 00:11:51,860
Yeah, everything's fine, Leo.

134
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:57,715
Come on home.
- I miss you, Shelly.

135
00:11:59,562 --> 00:12:01,142
I miss you, too.

136
00:12:18,617 --> 00:12:21,828
Hey, good-looking.
- Hope you don't mind my coming.

137
00:12:22,045 --> 00:12:23,709
Oh, no.

138
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:28,730
Nadine won't be back from that
patent attorney for a couple of hours.

139
00:12:28,943 --> 00:12:33,284
Silent drape runners?
- She's already spending the millions.

140
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:37,764
I have to put gas in my car
like everyone else, right?

141
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:44,238
I didn't want to tell you on the phone,
but Hank got his parole.

142
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:46,625
OK.

143
00:12:47,964 --> 00:12:51,556
He'll be coming home.
I mean, back.

144
00:12:51,556 --> 00:12:54,568
I only saw him
a minute before the hearing.

145
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:59,452
He seemed so hopeful,
I didn't want to say anything.

146
00:12:59,671 --> 00:13:04,142
You don't have to explain.
- Said anything to Nadine yet?

147
00:13:04,354 --> 00:13:06,149
Haven't yet.

148
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,953
Waiting for me to go first?
- No.

149
00:13:09,953 --> 00:13:14,463
It's just that...Nadine's not well.

150
00:13:16,811 --> 00:13:18,309
What are you saying?

151
00:13:19,195 --> 00:13:21,156
I don't know.

152
00:13:22,581 --> 00:13:24,708
I think I do.

153
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:30,480
I don't ever want to hurt you.
- Maybe that's our trouble, Ed.

154
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,369
We never want to hurt anyone.
We never just take what we want.

155
00:13:36,376 --> 00:13:41,847
I think that this is how it is when
you get to the end of your life,

156
00:13:42,104 --> 00:13:45,732
and you don't have anything
to show for it.

157
00:13:49,127 --> 00:13:53,135
Don't call me.
I mean, not for a while, OK?

158
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,391
OK.

159
00:13:58,409 --> 00:13:59,906
I love you, Ed.

160
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:23,184
I remember when you were little.
- So did my father speak to you?

161
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:27,344
Yes, he did. And I can't tell you
how excited we are

162
00:14:27,344 --> 00:14:32,103
to have you come on-board and
put in a hitch here at our flagship.

163
00:14:32,322 --> 00:14:34,200
What did you have in mind?

164
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:39,166
Well, as per your father's suggestion,
starting low, aiming high,

165
00:14:39,427 --> 00:14:43,733
we thought perhaps the wrapping
department. Gifts, etc.

166
00:14:43,942 --> 00:14:47,903
Part-time, after school.
- No, no, no.

167
00:14:48,918 --> 00:14:50,583
Emory.

168
00:14:51,803 --> 00:14:53,514
May I speak frankly?

169
00:14:53,514 --> 00:14:55,016
Please do.

170
00:14:56,527 --> 00:14:58,773
Let's talk...

171
00:14:59,621 --> 00:15:01,284
...retail.

172
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:04,426
Sales?
- Perfume.

173
00:15:05,264 --> 00:15:10,187
One of our more sensitive areas.
Expensive items, customer relations.

174
00:15:10,407 --> 00:15:15,043
I've got my heart set on it, Emory.
- I'd have to talk to your father.

175
00:15:15,256 --> 00:15:17,549
Emory, here's what we're gonna do.

176
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:22,069
You're gonna tell my father
I'm busy as a bee wrapping boxes.

177
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:25,788
Then you'll put me to work
behind the perfume counter.

178
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:30,590
If you don't, I'll rip my dress,
scream at the top of my lungs

179
00:15:30,808 --> 00:15:33,936
and tell my father
that you made a pass at me.

180
00:15:34,152 --> 00:15:37,031
Does that help
clear things up for you?

181
00:15:38,249 --> 00:15:39,914
Yes.

182
00:15:40,925 --> 00:15:42,554
Yes, what?

183
00:15:45,524 --> 00:15:47,070
Yes, Miss Horne.

184
00:15:56,977 --> 00:15:59,107
Shall we start on the paperwork?

185
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,067
James, I got your note.

186
00:16:11,493 --> 00:16:15,668
Are you all right?
- There's some things I've gotta say.

187
00:16:15,668 --> 00:16:20,811
I told you that my dad died
when I was 10? He didn't die.

188
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:25,492
He was a musician.
We lived out West.

189
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:29,300
He ran off on me and my mom.
- I'm sorry.

190
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,061
My mom was a writer.
Poems and short stories.

191
00:16:35,658 --> 00:16:37,987
She's an alcoholic.

192
00:16:38,961 --> 00:16:41,255
If you have a problem with this...

193
00:16:41,469 --> 00:16:44,096
I don't have a problem.
You tell me.

194
00:16:45,775 --> 00:16:49,033
It's true she was out of town
this week, but...

195
00:16:49,033 --> 00:16:51,831
she wasn't travelling.

196
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:55,926
What she does is
she goes to another town,

197
00:16:56,186 --> 00:17:00,274
shacks up in some cheap hotel
with a couple of bottles...

198
00:17:00,274 --> 00:17:03,208
picks up guys and....

199
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,909
It's all right.

200
00:17:15,542 --> 00:17:18,634
I don't want to have
any secrets from you.

201
00:17:18,845 --> 00:17:22,055
I don't want there to be any lies
between us.

202
00:17:22,314 --> 00:17:26,738
Secrets kill people's happiness.
I don't want us to be like that.

203
00:17:26,955 --> 00:17:30,046
We won't. We won't be.

204
00:17:35,023 --> 00:17:37,317
We have to do what's right.

205
00:17:38,326 --> 00:17:40,657
What you said yesterday was true.

206
00:17:40,918 --> 00:17:43,795
If we don't find out
what happened to Laura,

207
00:17:44,053 --> 00:17:46,050
it won't go away, our whole lives.

208
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:48,439
We will, James.

209
00:17:51,078 --> 00:17:57,295
She's out there, a restless spirit.
- I feel it, too. We owe it to her.

210
00:17:57,295 --> 00:17:59,768
At least they're fresh. Here, Gary.

211
00:17:59,982 --> 00:18:01,527
Oh, thanks.

212
00:18:02,491 --> 00:18:05,035
Here you go, Scott.
- Thank you.

213
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,300
There you are.

214
00:18:10,684 --> 00:18:13,441
What do you wanna mark this?
- "Duplicate".

215
00:18:13,652 --> 00:18:17,243
Do we have one like it?
- Yeah, the same stain as before.

216
00:18:17,498 --> 00:18:19,328
Mark it "duplicate".

217
00:18:21,972 --> 00:18:24,219
Red drapes.

218
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:28,147
That PO box was registered
to Jacques Renault.

219
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:31,788
Those are the letters responding
to Ronnette's ad.

220
00:18:31,788 --> 00:18:35,590
Let's see if there's something
from someone we know.

221
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:38,568
Hawk, hand me that magazine.
- What is it?

222
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,363
Two different ad numbers
mailed to the same address.

223
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:45,625
Ronnette's and one other.

224
00:18:47,222 --> 00:18:49,601
Yeah, here it is.

225
00:18:50,358 --> 00:18:55,994
"Student requires education in ways
of love. Generous, mature men only."

226
00:18:56,174 --> 00:18:58,005
It's Laura.

227
00:18:59,517 --> 00:19:01,979
You see some identifying mark?

228
00:19:02,235 --> 00:19:05,327
The drapes.
- Drapes?

229
00:19:09,384 --> 00:19:12,559
Red drapes, Harry.
From my dream.

230
00:19:17,202 --> 00:19:21,875
Why would an apartment dweller like
Jacques buy 50 gallons of heating oil?

231
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:25,430
To heat a log cabin.
- Harry, you're all right!

232
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,947
Jacques' brother mentioned
a place by the state line.

233
00:19:28,947 --> 00:19:31,536
Fellas, pack a lunch.
We're taking a walk in the woods.

234
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:42,954
Madeleine!

235
00:19:43,206 --> 00:19:44,704
Hi.
- Hi.

236
00:19:45,756 --> 00:19:50,428
Hi, I'm Madeleine Ferguson.
My friends call me Maddy.

237
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:54,608
This is really nice of you guys,
I don't know anyone in town,

238
00:19:54,828 --> 00:19:57,586
except Aunt Sarah and Uncle Leland.

239
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:02,310
And the mood at the house
isn't that great right now.

240
00:20:02,521 --> 00:20:05,980
Would you like something to drink?
- A cherry Coke.

241
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,578
You got it.

242
00:20:10,632 --> 00:20:16,266
Madeleine, if I said that you can't
say a word of this to anyone,

243
00:20:16,525 --> 00:20:18,820
would that be OK with you?

244
00:20:19,034 --> 00:20:20,947
Sounds like some big secret.

245
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:25,008
It is. James and I knew Laura
better than anyone did.

246
00:20:25,263 --> 00:20:29,353
She was in terrible trouble,
worse than we can imagine.

247
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:31,281
What?

248
00:20:31,535 --> 00:20:35,874
I'd rather not say too much
about things we can't prove yet.

249
00:20:36,634 --> 00:20:39,643
You said you can't prove it yet.

250
00:20:39,854 --> 00:20:43,480
We're afraid the truth
might never come out

251
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,708
or whoever killed her
might never be caught.

252
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,339
We've sworn not to let that happen.

253
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:52,644
You know who did it?
- We have some ideas.

254
00:20:52,855 --> 00:20:57,244
We wanted to ask for your help.
- What do you want me to do?

255
00:20:57,955 --> 00:21:00,880
Laura talked about
a secret hiding place.

256
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,140
Somewhere in her house,
maybe in her room.

257
00:21:04,352 --> 00:21:06,314
Nobody else knew about it.

258
00:21:06,314 --> 00:21:11,038
She might have left something there
that could lead us to the killer.

259
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:15,298
I'll help you.
- You will?

260
00:21:15,721 --> 00:21:21,488
The day before she died,
I had a feeling Laura was in trouble.

261
00:21:22,535 --> 00:21:26,376
I've always felt close to her.
That's why I came here.

262
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,763
You know...

263
00:21:29,015 --> 00:21:33,106
I didn't really know Laura
that well, but I feel like I do.

264
00:21:33,321 --> 00:21:36,698
Our folks always told us
how much alike we were.

265
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,919
Will you call me
if there's anything I can do?

266
00:21:40,135 --> 00:21:42,977
I don't think
there'll be any problems.

267
00:21:43,188 --> 00:21:45,517
Madeleine, this is really great.

268
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:47,485
Call me Maddy.

269
00:21:53,932 --> 00:21:55,512
Hi.
- Hi, Norma.

270
00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:00,574
We're like refugee beauty queens.
- You don't know how pretty you are.

271
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,123
I hope I don't chip a nail
slinging plates around.

272
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:06,557
Hi, Norma.
- Hello, Hank.

273
00:22:06,557 --> 00:22:10,272
Surprised to see me?
- Yes.

274
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:17,717
That Leo's girlfriend?
- Wife.

275
00:22:17,934 --> 00:22:20,893
That Leo. So impulsive.

276
00:22:21,277 --> 00:22:23,524
Not much meat on her, though.

277
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,660
I don't expect a kiss.

278
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:31,052
I figure I gotta earn my way
back into your heart.

279
00:22:31,311 --> 00:22:32,892
But, Norma...

280
00:22:33,862 --> 00:22:35,990
I intend to try.

281
00:22:36,663 --> 00:22:39,456
So where do I start?

282
00:22:40,132 --> 00:22:42,295
Washing dishes will be fine.

283
00:22:42,933 --> 00:22:46,225
Can I finish my coffee first?

284
00:22:46,738 --> 00:22:48,569
Boss?

285
00:23:19,027 --> 00:23:22,119
He's been spending
more of his time in his room.

286
00:23:22,329 --> 00:23:25,292
It's difficult to engage him
in conversation.

287
00:23:25,292 --> 00:23:26,878
Terrible mood swings.

288
00:23:27,095 --> 00:23:30,520
His school attendance
has become erratic at best.

289
00:23:30,774 --> 00:23:34,652
And then the fighting at the Roadhouse
and at the funeral.

290
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:37,416
Are you using drugs, Bobby?
- Nope.

291
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,383
Alcohol's a drug.
- That's not what he meant.

292
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:43,608
Alcohol doesn't count?
- Everybody drinks.

293
00:23:43,818 --> 00:23:46,397
Are you unhappy?
- Shouldn't I be?

294
00:23:47,162 --> 00:23:49,075
That's not for me to say.

295
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:52,468
Have you ever killed anybody?
- Have you?

296
00:23:52,468 --> 00:23:54,760
My father has.
- During wartime.

297
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,894
That's different.
- From what?

298
00:23:57,446 --> 00:24:00,704
Maybe I should spend a few minutes
with Bobby alone?

299
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:03,630
This is supposed to be
family counselling.

300
00:24:03,885 --> 00:24:08,142
I'll need to spend time
with each member of the family alone.

301
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:10,439
Bobby first.
- Fair enough.

302
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,536
Whatever you say.

303
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,137
Bobby, let's just cut the crap, huh?

304
00:24:31,393 --> 00:24:35,484
So your parents don't understand
what you're going through.

305
00:24:35,484 --> 00:24:37,288
That's a good one.

306
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:41,928
Let's talk about Laura.
- OK, let's talk about Laura.

307
00:24:42,138 --> 00:24:47,738
Bobby, what happened the first time
that you and Laura made love?

308
00:24:49,579 --> 00:24:52,422
What the hell kind of question
is that?

309
00:24:53,467 --> 00:24:56,511
Bobby, did you cry?

310
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:00,064
Did I what?

311
00:25:01,662 --> 00:25:05,205
And then what did Laura do,
did she laugh at you?

312
00:25:19,137 --> 00:25:22,098
Were you very sad when Laura died?

313
00:25:23,651 --> 00:25:27,326
Laura wanted to die.
- How do you know that?

314
00:25:33,853 --> 00:25:36,814
Because she told me.

315
00:25:38,118 --> 00:25:40,697
What else did she tell you?

316
00:25:42,548 --> 00:25:46,638
Did she tell you there was
no goodness in the world?

317
00:25:48,402 --> 00:25:53,455
She said people tried to be good,

318
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:56,328
but they were really
sick and rotten.

319
00:25:56,395 --> 00:25:58,523
Her, most of all.

320
00:25:58,736 --> 00:26:04,088
Every time she tried to make
the world a better place,

321
00:26:04,088 --> 00:26:06,335
something terrible
came up inside her

322
00:26:06,554 --> 00:26:10,513
and pulled her back down into hell.

323
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:16,038
It took her deeper and deeper
into the blackest nightmare.

324
00:26:16,038 --> 00:26:19,553
Every time, it got harder
to go back up to the light.

325
00:26:19,553 --> 00:26:22,137
Did you sometimes have the feeling

326
00:26:22,357 --> 00:26:26,066
Laura was harbouring
some awful secret?

327
00:26:26,371 --> 00:26:27,619
Yeah.

328
00:26:27,874 --> 00:26:31,549
Bad enough that she wanted to die?
- Yes.

329
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:36,228
Bad enough to drive her to prey
upon people's weaknesses,

330
00:26:36,446 --> 00:26:39,122
tempt them, break them down?

331
00:26:39,371 --> 00:26:43,081
Make them do degrading things?
- Yes.

332
00:26:43,081 --> 00:26:49,027
Laura wanted to corrupt people because
that's how she felt about herself.

333
00:26:49,027 --> 00:26:51,775
Is that what happened to you, Bobby?

334
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,499
Is that what Laura did to you?

335
00:26:56,931 --> 00:27:00,225
She wanted so much.

336
00:27:00,693 --> 00:27:04,700
She made me sell drugs
so she could have them.

337
00:27:35,827 --> 00:27:38,121
This way. Through here.

338
00:27:38,336 --> 00:27:41,879
Watch your step there, city boy.
- Thanks, Harry.

339
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,511
What is it, Hawk?

340
00:28:09,982 --> 00:28:14,455
Not the cabin we're looking for.
- Maybe, maybe not.

341
00:28:15,837 --> 00:28:18,631
Might wanna hang back a step, Doc.

342
00:28:18,846 --> 00:28:21,058
Might want to anyway.

343
00:28:41,881 --> 00:28:43,926
About time you got here.

344
00:28:45,311 --> 00:28:48,852
They move so slowly
when they're not afraid.

345
00:28:49,951 --> 00:28:53,873
Come on, then.
My log does not judge.

346
00:29:07,215 --> 00:29:08,679
I've got tea.

347
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:11,565
I've got cookies. No cake.

348
00:29:11,803 --> 00:29:15,179
That's very kind of you, ma'am,
but I don't believe...

349
00:29:15,564 --> 00:29:17,527
What kind of cookies?

350
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,492
Sugar.

351
00:29:19,703 --> 00:29:22,546
The owls won't see us in here.

352
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:27,390
A cup of tea would be very nice.

353
00:29:29,026 --> 00:29:32,402
Shut your eyes
and you'll burst into flames.

354
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,669
Thanks, Margaret.

355
00:29:35,757 --> 00:29:37,921
We'll let it steep.

356
00:29:44,704 --> 00:29:47,627
Wait for the tea.
The fish aren't running.

357
00:29:49,135 --> 00:29:52,560
You've been expecting us?
- You're two days late.

358
00:29:53,273 --> 00:29:55,853
But that's your concern.

359
00:29:56,996 --> 00:30:01,084
My log saw something.
Something significant.

360
00:30:01,802 --> 00:30:07,605
What did your log see?
- Tea first, then be ready.

361
00:30:12,463 --> 00:30:14,044
Thank you.

362
00:30:15,264 --> 00:30:18,522
My husband was a logging man.
- Oh?

363
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:24,828
He met the devil. Fire is the devil,
hiding like a coward in the smoke.

364
00:30:24,828 --> 00:30:28,929
It was the day after the wedding,
wasn't it, Margaret?

365
00:30:29,522 --> 00:30:32,313
The wood holds many spirits, doesn't it?

366
00:30:38,675 --> 00:30:41,088
You can ask it now.

367
00:30:47,581 --> 00:30:49,958
What did you see that night?

368
00:30:50,172 --> 00:30:53,596
The night Laura Palmer was killed?

369
00:30:54,813 --> 00:30:57,060
I'll do the talking.

370
00:30:59,371 --> 00:31:01,283
Dark.

371
00:31:01,963 --> 00:31:06,135
Laughing. The owls were flying.

372
00:31:06,352 --> 00:31:08,266
Many things were blocked.

373
00:31:08,526 --> 00:31:12,996
Laughing. Two men. Two girls.

374
00:31:13,584 --> 00:31:15,712
Flashlights pass by...

375
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:18,594
in the woods over the ridge.

376
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,892
The owls were near.

377
00:31:21,109 --> 00:31:24,653
The dark was pressing in on her.

378
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:29,846
Quiet then. Later, footsteps.

379
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,893
One man pass by.

380
00:31:32,105 --> 00:31:35,898
Screams, far away.

381
00:31:36,578 --> 00:31:40,799
Terrible. Terrible.

382
00:31:41,176 --> 00:31:43,756
One voice.
- Man or girl?

383
00:31:43,977 --> 00:31:46,106
Girl.

384
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:50,245
Further up. Over the ridge.

385
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:52,920
The owls were silent.

386
00:32:03,068 --> 00:32:06,409
The two girls were
Laura and Ronnette.

387
00:32:06,555 --> 00:32:10,978
The two men?
Jacques? Maybe Leo?

388
00:32:11,101 --> 00:32:12,600
Maybe.

389
00:32:13,609 --> 00:32:15,858
Who's the third man?

390
00:32:18,209 --> 00:32:20,374
Do you hear it?

391
00:32:22,306 --> 00:32:24,387
This way.

392
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:37,215
"And there's always music
in the air."

393
00:33:39,813 --> 00:33:41,443
Waldo.

394
00:33:42,321 --> 00:33:44,616
There's film in here.

395
00:33:50,308 --> 00:33:51,889
Blood.

396
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:15,383
One-Eyed Jacks.

397
00:34:37,703 --> 00:34:41,412
Good evening. Mr and Mrs Showel?
- OK, go right ahead.

398
00:34:41,415 --> 00:34:46,337
Good evening.
- Catherine Martell and spouse.

399
00:34:49,233 --> 00:34:53,573
Go easy on the sauce tonight,
OK, Cathy?

400
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:02,893
A couple of belts and even you
might start to look good to me.

401
00:35:16,951 --> 00:35:20,208
The modern age changed everything,
Mr Thorson.

402
00:35:20,421 --> 00:35:24,298
But it's my guess that
there's still vestigial interest

403
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,723
in the folklore of Iceland.

404
00:35:26,984 --> 00:35:29,612
Vestigial. Absolutely.

405
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:32,241
Heba, did you know
that was a saying?

406
00:35:32,503 --> 00:35:33,835
No, Jerry.

407
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:37,183
Heba-heba.
You never heard that before?

408
00:35:37,436 --> 00:35:39,267
No, Jerry.

409
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:52,770
Do you realise the incredible
potential that could result

410
00:35:52,988 --> 00:35:59,586
from our taking a mutual dip
in each other's respective gene pools?

411
00:36:00,095 --> 00:36:03,722
Heba, I want to cook for you.

412
00:36:04,986 --> 00:36:07,827
Very, very good. That's funny.

413
00:36:07,827 --> 00:36:13,715
So he says, "What do you get when
you cross a Norwegian with a Swede?"

414
00:36:13,715 --> 00:36:17,732
A socialist who wants to be king!

415
00:36:18,364 --> 00:36:22,289
Well, I can remember
it was somewhere in the '50s

416
00:36:22,289 --> 00:36:25,089
I came through your country.
Beautiful.

417
00:36:25,305 --> 00:36:28,015
Not many trees, you know, but...

418
00:36:36,258 --> 00:36:39,218
Would you excuse me?
- Of course.

419
00:36:39,894 --> 00:36:43,403
Meet me in my office.
Give me two minutes to break away.

420
00:36:43,616 --> 00:36:47,122
Hell hath no fury.
- What?

421
00:36:47,795 --> 00:36:49,508
Two minutes.

422
00:36:50,263 --> 00:36:53,354
Thor, I've been meaning to ask you,

423
00:36:53,608 --> 00:36:56,615
are you familiar
with the word luhamsta?

424
00:37:17,811 --> 00:37:20,604
Catherine, we agreed.

425
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:25,294
No scenes in front of the guests.
Keep the melodrama to a minimum.

426
00:37:25,503 --> 00:37:29,463
Next thing I know, you're polishing
my shoes with Dom Perignon.

427
00:37:29,463 --> 00:37:32,770
Fill me in. What's eating you?

428
00:37:35,914 --> 00:37:40,837
Why did you have this $1,000 chip
from you-know-where in your pants?

429
00:37:41,097 --> 00:37:45,770
I thought you preferred women
with certain experience.

430
00:37:46,198 --> 00:37:48,529
Jerry gave me that.

431
00:37:50,253 --> 00:37:52,880
It's good luck. I thought I'd lost it.

432
00:37:53,096 --> 00:37:55,177
I'm so relieved you found it.

433
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,868
Are you quite finished?

434
00:38:04,718 --> 00:38:06,382
Yes.

435
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:08,729
In that case....

436
00:38:16,851 --> 00:38:19,694
Let's burn the mill.
Let's do it tonight.

437
00:38:19,945 --> 00:38:24,000
No, my love, we'll give Josie
one last chance to sell.

438
00:38:24,034 --> 00:38:26,579
Tomorrow. Failing that...

439
00:38:26,793 --> 00:38:33,261
I have retained the services
of a qualified professional.

440
00:38:34,569 --> 00:38:35,770
Breath mint?

441
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:55,050
Now let me get this straight.

442
00:38:56,392 --> 00:39:02,111
Your entire country
is above the timberline?

443
00:39:02,369 --> 00:39:05,248
Folks, can I have
your attention, please?

444
00:39:05,506 --> 00:39:07,586
Can I have your attention?

445
00:39:09,018 --> 00:39:12,776
Thank you for turning out
to welcome our neighbours

446
00:39:12,989 --> 00:39:15,700
from the magical isle of Iceland.

447
00:39:20,388 --> 00:39:23,766
We are all Icelanders!

448
00:39:26,492 --> 00:39:30,368
Ghostwood Estates is
an important part of our future,

449
00:39:30,632 --> 00:39:35,637
and there's no one we'd rather have
as partners in our future than...

450
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,249
Dance with him.

451
00:39:55,507 --> 00:39:57,753
It is serious. Dance with him.

452
00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:08,920
All right!

453
00:40:12,187 --> 00:40:14,897
Hey, Jerry. What's going on?

454
00:40:16,158 --> 00:40:20,118
Get Jacoby, get a net,
but get him out of my life.

455
00:40:33,926 --> 00:40:35,175
Jerry.

456
00:41:33,354 --> 00:41:35,184
Donna? It's Maddy.

457
00:41:35,444 --> 00:41:40,532
I remembered, when we were younger,
Laura hid cigarettes in her bedpost.

458
00:41:40,753 --> 00:41:44,130
The top of one of the posts
screws off.

459
00:41:44,726 --> 00:41:48,518
I found a tape in her hiding place.
- Leland?

460
00:41:48,518 --> 00:41:51,408
I'll meet you and James tomorrow.

461
00:41:51,623 --> 00:41:55,082
OK! And bring a tape recorder.

462
00:42:31,422 --> 00:42:34,349
Did anyone see you come in here?

463
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,350
No.

464
00:42:36,606 --> 00:42:41,614
You do realise the risk
if anyone sees us.

465
00:42:42,752 --> 00:42:47,010
This was hidden in her desk,
where you said it would be.

466
00:42:51,405 --> 00:42:54,414
Then we can proceed.
- When?

467
00:42:58,136 --> 00:43:00,134
Tomorrow night.

468
00:43:50,354 --> 00:43:53,527
I told you to mind the store,
not open a franchise.

469
00:43:53,527 --> 00:43:56,241
Hank, I...
- Do as you're told, Leo.

470
00:43:56,456 --> 00:44:01,712
Next time you'll watch me take
your chippy apart before I kill you.

471
00:44:07,083 --> 00:44:09,131
Get me a beer.
- What happened?

472
00:44:09,174 --> 00:44:11,218
Just get me a damn beer!

473
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,356
Get up and...

474
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:20,705
What are you doing?
- You're not gonna hurt me again.

475
00:44:20,923 --> 00:44:23,599
Don't touch me!
Don't come near me, Leo!

477
00:44:27,277 --> 00:44:28,941
You haven't got the guts.

478
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,136
Reach over and turn on the light.

479
00:45:21,834 --> 00:45:24,211
Don't make me leave.

480
00:45:25,137 --> 00:45:28,478
Please, don't make me leave.
