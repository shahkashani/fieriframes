1
00:00:32,965 --> 00:00:34,729
You do your
homework? Uh-huh.

2
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:36,763
Finish those beets?

3
00:00:36,764 --> 00:00:37,996
Yep.

4
00:00:38,473 --> 00:00:40,533
Can I have the fudge cake?

5
00:00:40,776 --> 00:00:42,175
Close your eyes.

6
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:43,304
Dad, I don't wanna...

7
00:00:43,305 --> 00:00:44,541
Now.

8
00:00:50,391 --> 00:00:52,518
Which letter is out
in the exit sign?

9
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:53,583
The "X."

10
00:00:53,584 --> 00:00:54,789
What color is the vinyl?

11
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:55,922
What's vinyl?

12
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:57,729
It's the stuff
these seats are covered in.

13
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:58,826
Purple.

14
00:00:58,827 --> 00:01:00,839
Maroon, close enough.
Manager's name?

15
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,239
Who?
She's wearing a name tag,

16
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,744
the woman standing at the front
door when we first walked in.

17
00:01:04,745 --> 00:01:06,213
<i>You saw her.</i>

18
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:13,053
Marie.
Can I have the cake now?

19
00:01:14,828 --> 00:01:16,261
How many hats?

20
00:01:16,262 --> 00:01:17,559
Come on, Dad!

21
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,435
Shawn, you want a piece of cake?
How many hats are in the room?

22
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:23,564
Does a beanie count?

23
00:01:23,565 --> 00:01:25,338
What do you think?

24
00:01:26,781 --> 00:01:27,838
Three.

25
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:29,041
You didn't describe them.

26
00:01:29,042 --> 00:01:31,848
That's not fair.
Time's almost up, Shawn.

27
00:01:32,823 --> 00:01:35,053
One has a flower,
the one the lady's wearing.

28
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:37,390
One has a picture
of some kind of lion,

29
00:01:37,391 --> 00:01:39,557
on the weird guy
with the crooked tooth.

30
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,761
The last one is on the chef.

31
00:01:41,762 --> 00:01:42,860
What about the beanie?

32
00:01:42,861 --> 00:01:45,067
A beanie's a cap, not a hat.

33
00:01:45,977 --> 00:01:48,275
All right, open your eyes.
Thank you!

34
00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:50,111
Wow, that's amazing.

35
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:52,476
It's adequate.

36
00:01:54,557 --> 00:01:56,023
Get him his cake.

37
00:01:56,024 --> 00:01:58,220
I guess I know what you're
gonna be when you grow up.

38
00:01:58,221 --> 00:02:00,788
Oh, I'm never gonna grow up,
ma'am.

39
00:02:08,544 --> 00:02:10,445
Nice place.
Thank you.

40
00:02:11,383 --> 00:02:14,045
<i>Precipitation later
on in the week, but all in all,</i>

41
00:02:14,046 --> 00:02:16,315
<i>a wonderful day
to take a hike.</i>

42
00:02:16,316 --> 00:02:18,256
<i>Now, back to you, Dana.</i>

43
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:21,025
I knew you were gonna be
my best table.

44
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,696
<i>...voicing her concerns</i>

45
00:02:24,697 --> 00:02:27,763
<i>regarding the department's
long-time policies.</i>

46
00:02:28,475 --> 00:02:31,536
<i>Joe, do the police have
any leads at this time?</i>

47
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:35,216
<i>We're at a loss, we really
don't know what else to do.</i>

48
00:02:35,217 --> 00:02:37,754
<i>It's been a tough few weeks,
we've basically run out of ideas.</i>

49
00:02:37,755 --> 00:02:40,951
<i>Hopefully, the police will
be able to crack this one for us.</i>

50
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,053
<i>Closing the books
on Divisions' break-ins</i>

51
00:02:43,054 --> 00:02:47,159
<i>could be just the olive branch needed
to set things in the right direction.</i>

52
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,898
What are you doing?

53
00:02:48,899 --> 00:02:50,166
I'm calling the police.

54
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:51,833
Any particular reason?

55
00:02:51,834 --> 00:02:54,106
I think I just
closed a case.

56
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,705
You didn't tell me
you're a cop.

57
00:02:55,706 --> 00:02:57,547
Oh, no, no, no.
Definitely not a cop.

58
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:00,119
Does that disappoint you?

59
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,455
I just thought you
might have handcuffs.

60
00:03:02,456 --> 00:03:04,290
Oh, I have handcuffs.
Hello?

61
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,626
<i>Santa Barbara
Police Department.</i>

62
00:03:05,627 --> 00:03:08,259
<i>It's the store manager,
he did it. Pardon me?</i>

63
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,398
The stereo robberies,
at Divisions chain store.

64
00:03:12,809 --> 00:03:15,040
He's on Channel 8 News
right now.

65
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,843
His hands, nervous tick,
dead giveaway.

66
00:03:16,844 --> 00:03:18,109
And he won't look at the
reporter in the eyes.

67
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,346
<i>And your name is?
My name?</i>

68
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:22,481
My name is Shawn Spencer.

69
00:03:22,482 --> 00:03:23,615
<i>And is there
anything else today?</i>

70
00:03:23,616 --> 00:03:24,819
No, that's gonna do it.

71
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,420
<i>Retailers
are waiting and hoping...</i>

72
00:03:27,421 --> 00:03:29,467
Actually, the tags on
the news van have expired,

73
00:03:29,468 --> 00:03:31,869
but that's completely
unrelated.

74
00:03:52,638 --> 00:03:53,626
Hello, Officer.

75
00:03:53,627 --> 00:03:57,074
Okay, but you gotta go.
It was awesome. Well, yeah.

76
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,413
Yeah.

77
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:06,517
Hi.
It was amazing.

78
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:08,522
I'm Shawn Spencer.

79
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,656
And the other thing is...

80
00:04:10,657 --> 00:04:12,596
Well, no, I'm not gonna
pay for it.

81
00:04:12,597 --> 00:04:16,162
Oh, no, no, no,
that's not for me.

82
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:20,668
I'm here for a commendation.
I called in a tip.

83
00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:21,907
Uh-huh.

84
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:25,012
Oh, no, Michelle,
I can't pay for that.

85
00:04:25,013 --> 00:04:27,717
Here's the thing,
these are new pants.

86
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,927
Clearly, you feel
very strongly about this.

87
00:04:31,296 --> 00:04:32,423
Right.

88
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:45,045
Eighty dollars is
a lot for a reading.

89
00:04:45,046 --> 00:04:49,055
But she was astounding. I mean,
she knew about Granny's childhood,

90
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:51,058
and the curios
she left Bobby.

91
00:04:51,059 --> 00:04:54,121
I mean, I could literally
feel her spirit in the room.

92
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,176
Get out of here.

93
00:05:08,086 --> 00:05:09,519
You know,
I have the same tattoo.

94
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,785
They spelled bloodthirsty wrong
on mine, can you believe it?

95
00:05:14,797 --> 00:05:17,790
I cannot believe you
didn't test that out first.

96
00:05:20,105 --> 00:05:24,134
One, two three. One, two,
three. One, two, three.

97
00:05:30,287 --> 00:05:32,983
What'd you do?
Bust up your ex-wife's car?

98
00:05:32,984 --> 00:05:34,548
Her new boyfriend's.

99
00:05:34,549 --> 00:05:35,992
That'll teach her.

100
00:05:35,993 --> 00:05:37,929
They got no witnesses.

101
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,294
Sweet.

102
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:46,243
You might wanna brush the shards
of taillight off your sleeve.

103
00:05:46,244 --> 00:05:47,711
Just a tip.

104
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:51,047
Gee, thanks, guy.

105
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:52,409
Sure.

106
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,761
Right this way,
Mr. Spencer.

107
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:06,935
So, when do I
get my money?

108
00:06:07,211 --> 00:06:08,199
Money?

109
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,906
Yeah, the reward?

110
00:06:10,181 --> 00:06:13,084
You guys arrested the
store manager, am I right?

111
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,085
Why don't you let us ask
the questions for a while?

112
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,587
Okay.

113
00:06:29,245 --> 00:06:31,440
So, which questions
might those be?

114
00:06:31,441 --> 00:06:33,312
Oh, I don't know. Like,

115
00:06:33,313 --> 00:06:35,750
where were you the night
of the last robbery?

116
00:06:36,655 --> 00:06:38,784
I was robbing a stereo shop.

117
00:06:40,429 --> 00:06:42,124
I wasn't.

118
00:06:42,532 --> 00:06:45,660
I don't know, I guess I was doing
the same thing you were doing.

119
00:06:45,661 --> 00:06:46,862
Not solving crime.

120
00:06:46,863 --> 00:06:48,496
You're not helping
your case here.

121
00:06:48,497 --> 00:06:49,803
My case?

122
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,080
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm actually a suspect?

123
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,481
Oh, you're our lead suspect.

124
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,851
I gave you the guy.
He had a partner.

125
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:01,017
I have to find that guy?
I'm confused.

126
00:07:01,018 --> 00:07:02,390
When do you start chipping in?

127
00:07:02,391 --> 00:07:03,554
See, your information
was good.

128
00:07:03,555 --> 00:07:06,794
So good, it could only have
come from the inside.

129
00:07:06,795 --> 00:07:08,460
Inside of what?

130
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:12,707
Look, I've called in
dozens of tips, okay?

131
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,302
Just check it out.
I did,

132
00:07:14,303 --> 00:07:16,109
I checked out
a whole lot of stuff.

133
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,981
Like... Oh, you're
currently unemployed.

134
00:07:18,982 --> 00:07:21,249
You've never held a job
for more than six months,

135
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,055
and you have
a criminal record.

136
00:07:24,056 --> 00:07:25,186
I was 18.

137
00:07:25,187 --> 00:07:26,924
Oh, 18?

138
00:07:26,925 --> 00:07:29,969
Well, that makes it okay,
let me just scratch this out!

139
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,095
I borrowed a car.

140
00:07:31,096 --> 00:07:32,161
You stole a car.

141
00:07:32,162 --> 00:07:33,367
To impress a girl.

142
00:07:33,368 --> 00:07:34,774
Look, forgive us,
Mr. Spencer,

143
00:07:34,775 --> 00:07:36,779
if this seems far-fetched.

144
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,341
Would it help at all if I told you
that she had a bit of a reputation

145
00:07:40,342 --> 00:07:43,788
and I was 0 for high school?

146
00:07:47,731 --> 00:07:50,064
Okay, fine. There were
extenuating circumstances.

147
00:07:50,065 --> 00:07:51,396
The arresting officer
was my father,

148
00:07:51,397 --> 00:07:53,028
he was trying to
teach me a lesson.

149
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:54,734
Did you learn it?

150
00:07:55,343 --> 00:07:57,743
I learned I hated my father,
so, sure.

151
00:07:57,744 --> 00:07:59,805
Well, pardon me if I'm
just a little skeptical.

152
00:07:59,806 --> 00:08:02,647
Believable, as it is, that
you solved all these crimes...

153
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,880
I'm sorry, what was it?

154
00:08:03,881 --> 00:08:06,721
Watching the local
Channel 8 News reports.

155
00:08:06,722 --> 00:08:11,129
I confess. That's not true.
Sometimes I watch Channel 5.

156
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,501
I prefer Channel 8.
The weather girl? Adorable.

157
00:08:14,502 --> 00:08:17,633
So you're telling us that you can
read guilt off of TV interviews.

158
00:08:17,634 --> 00:08:18,768
Can't you?

159
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:20,780
Don't you try and
trivialize police work.

160
00:08:20,781 --> 00:08:24,411
I think you're doing a bang-up
job of that all by yourself.

161
00:08:24,412 --> 00:08:27,856
You can't keep me here, guys.
I know my rights.

162
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,861
Good. Then you know you have
the right to remain silent.

163
00:08:30,862 --> 00:08:31,919
You have the right
to an attorney.

164
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,730
If you cannot afford one,
one will be appointed to you.

165
00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:37,068
Wait a minute,
you're serious?

166
00:08:37,069 --> 00:08:39,735
A few hours in a holding cell
might jog your memory.

167
00:08:47,512 --> 00:08:50,218
Just give us a reason, Mr.
Spencer. That's all we need.

168
00:08:50,219 --> 00:08:51,784
How did you get
this information?

169
00:08:51,785 --> 00:08:53,694
No, it is too
late for that.

170
00:08:53,695 --> 00:08:55,735
Officer Allen, book him.

171
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:57,565
Book him?

172
00:08:57,872 --> 00:09:00,534
Oh, come on, cuffs? What? For
the walk back to the lobby?

173
00:09:00,535 --> 00:09:03,546
Or, you could give us
a plausible explanation.

174
00:09:08,622 --> 00:09:12,856
Okay, okay. Fine, you win.

175
00:09:15,265 --> 00:09:17,461
I got the information because

176
00:09:18,837 --> 00:09:20,304
I'm psychic.

177
00:09:20,305 --> 00:09:21,499
Get him out of here.

178
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,803
Oh, boy.

179
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:29,317
Your grandma
would be so proud.

180
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,524
You spoke to her?
I did.

181
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,924
She's safe, comfortable.

182
00:09:36,925 --> 00:09:40,595
She wants you to stop spending all
your money on those charlatans.

183
00:09:40,596 --> 00:09:41,728
The palm readers?

184
00:09:41,729 --> 00:09:42,864
The palm readers.

185
00:09:42,865 --> 00:09:47,608
Okay, just to be clear, you're
claiming to be a psychic, Mr. Spencer.

186
00:09:51,388 --> 00:09:54,256
How else would I know that
you two are sleeping together?

187
00:09:56,128 --> 00:10:01,228
One, two, three. One, two,
three. One, two, three. One...

188
00:10:03,206 --> 00:10:05,300
When's the wedding?
May 3rd.

189
00:10:05,976 --> 00:10:07,944
Wait, how'd you know?

190
00:10:07,945 --> 00:10:11,212
I'm getting dance lessons
for a wedding reception.

191
00:10:11,585 --> 00:10:13,486
And you are getting good.

192
00:10:14,423 --> 00:10:16,448
Wow, that's amazing.

193
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,825
Oh, come on.
Who's buying this?

194
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:23,099
I got it.

195
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:27,107
Go to detention room number
two, shake down your vandal.

196
00:10:27,108 --> 00:10:29,805
You'll find all the
evidence you need.

197
00:10:39,728 --> 00:10:42,324
All the evidence
is in his left shoe.

198
00:10:46,338 --> 00:10:47,772
We'll be back here
in three minutes.

199
00:10:48,341 --> 00:10:50,105
With my own cuffs!

200
00:10:54,785 --> 00:10:55,843
Whoa!

201
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:00,627
I'm getting...
I am getting

202
00:11:03,932 --> 00:11:05,490
the letter "L."

203
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:07,036
Lulu! Her dog!

204
00:11:07,737 --> 00:11:10,071
Is there anything else
she said?

205
00:11:11,276 --> 00:11:14,805
There's suddenly a very,
very negative presence here.

206
00:11:15,282 --> 00:11:16,944
It's blocking me.

207
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,388
That was a lucky guess.
A lucky guess?

208
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:21,083
He planted it.
I don't know.

209
00:11:21,084 --> 00:11:22,786
His alibi checks.

210
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:26,430
Question. Do I pay taxes
on reward money?

211
00:11:26,431 --> 00:11:30,598
I'll find out. Please,
feel free to call anytime.

212
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:33,165
You know I will.
Magic touch!

213
00:11:46,631 --> 00:11:47,997
Doctor?
Hey, yeah.

214
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,530
Not so fast, Mr. Spencer.

215
00:11:52,373 --> 00:11:54,740
Karen Vick,
Interim Police Chief.

216
00:11:54,741 --> 00:11:56,037
I know.

217
00:11:56,038 --> 00:11:57,170
Heard about what
you did in there.

218
00:11:57,171 --> 00:11:58,270
Oh, you're welcome.

219
00:11:58,271 --> 00:12:00,043
That wasn't the phrase
I was going to use.

220
00:12:00,044 --> 00:12:02,383
I was going to say,
improbable.

221
00:12:02,384 --> 00:12:04,890
Possible, yet unlikely.

222
00:12:05,326 --> 00:12:07,317
Look, it's hard to explain.

223
00:12:07,318 --> 00:12:09,490
I'm gifted.
I was born that way.

224
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:14,127
I knew your father, he was a
good cop. You're nothing like him.

225
00:12:14,128 --> 00:12:15,606
I take that as a compliment,
ma'am.

226
00:12:15,607 --> 00:12:17,668
Don't ever call me "ma'am."

227
00:12:19,215 --> 00:12:20,272
Am I still free to go?

228
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:21,749
Not exactly.

229
00:12:22,052 --> 00:12:24,111
You familiar with
the McCallum family?

230
00:12:24,112 --> 00:12:25,451
McCallum?

231
00:12:26,091 --> 00:12:27,490
Yeah, they own half the hill.

232
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:29,084
Well, there's been
a kidnapping.

233
00:12:29,085 --> 00:12:31,927
Oh, come on. I had
nothing to do with that.

234
00:12:31,928 --> 00:12:33,662
Would you like to?

235
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,338
The feds are itching
to jump in on this case,

236
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:38,807
and I need to make
some progress.

237
00:12:38,808 --> 00:12:42,508
What I need is a miracle,
or a facsimile of one.

238
00:12:44,786 --> 00:12:49,589
Oh. I see, I see.
Well, I make $1,200 a day.

239
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,787
It's a tryout.

240
00:12:50,788 --> 00:12:54,698
That's what I meant to say. This
is pro bono, something for you.

241
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:58,798
And if this psychic thing
is a scam, we will prosecute.

242
00:13:00,945 --> 00:13:04,906
You know hindering a police
investigation is a criminal offense?

243
00:13:07,822 --> 00:13:09,221
Sounds good!

244
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:12,956
We're on the same team now!
Kidnappers beware!

245
00:13:31,658 --> 00:13:33,216
I have a job for you.

246
00:13:33,217 --> 00:13:35,092
I already have a job.

247
00:13:35,364 --> 00:13:36,763
They're paying you
to play video games?

248
00:13:36,764 --> 00:13:37,857
How do you do that?

249
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,369
Come on, left hand, space bar,
right hand, arrow keys?

250
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:43,204
Gus, you should ask me a challenging
question every once in a while,

251
00:13:43,205 --> 00:13:44,504
just for kicks.

252
00:13:44,505 --> 00:13:46,273
I can't go anywhere.
I'm behind on my route.

253
00:13:46,274 --> 00:13:48,077
I've got new samples
of serum moxacillin.

254
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:52,110
Oh, man, I'm sorry. I didn't realize
the new butt cream had come in.

255
00:13:52,111 --> 00:13:54,249
So, you're not interested in
hearing about doing the thing

256
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,058
we've been dreaming of doing
since we were eight?

257
00:13:58,133 --> 00:14:01,103
I've got us the last job
we will ever need.

258
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,730
Shawn, you've had 57 jobs
since we left high school.

259
00:14:04,731 --> 00:14:08,610
Yes, I have. And they were all
fun, but this one takes the cake.

260
00:14:08,611 --> 00:14:10,912
Oh, yeah? Better than
your acupuncture clinic?

261
00:14:10,913 --> 00:14:12,919
I didn't realize
experience was necessary.

262
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,822
What about the summer you spent
driving the wiener mobile?

263
00:14:15,823 --> 00:14:17,827
I did that for the hot dogs.

264
00:14:17,828 --> 00:14:21,196
Look, Gus, all those jobs I took
because I wanted the experience.

265
00:14:21,197 --> 00:14:23,133
But then I mastered it
and I moved on.

266
00:14:23,134 --> 00:14:26,107
But this job has
a little bit of everything.

267
00:14:27,077 --> 00:14:28,875
Come with me.
No.

268
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,580
I'm never doing anything
blindly with you again.

269
00:14:31,581 --> 00:14:34,587
I learned that at the
Mexican border, twice.

270
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:38,459
Okay, this is hard to explain,
but I'm going to give it a shot.

271
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,053
You and I

272
00:14:41,766 --> 00:14:45,135
are opening our own
private detective agency.

273
00:14:47,074 --> 00:14:48,975
Oh. See?

274
00:14:49,912 --> 00:14:51,777
No explanation necessary.

275
00:14:51,778 --> 00:14:53,578
Let me get my coat.

276
00:14:55,821 --> 00:14:57,152
But you're not
getting your coat.

277
00:14:57,153 --> 00:14:59,089
No, no, Shawn, I'm not.

278
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,257
All right, you want to
sweat the details? Fine.

279
00:15:01,258 --> 00:15:05,061
The cops think I'm a psychic and now
we are investigating a kidnapping.

280
00:15:05,062 --> 00:15:07,297
You're serious?
Yes, I am serious!

281
00:15:07,298 --> 00:15:09,340
Six days ago,
Camden McCallum, Jr.,

282
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,400
sole male heir to
McCallum Textiles,

283
00:15:11,401 --> 00:15:15,280
was seen being forced into his Range
Rover at the municipal dog park.

284
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,751
No one has seen him
or the dog since.

285
00:15:17,752 --> 00:15:19,288
They took the dog?

286
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:21,883
You see what I mean?
I need you!

287
00:15:22,462 --> 00:15:24,555
I need you to
write stuff down.

288
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:27,397
'Cause you know how I zone out
when other people talk.

289
00:15:28,471 --> 00:15:30,496
Just for today?
Just today.

290
00:15:30,497 --> 00:15:32,371
Oh, and you know what? You
should bring your sample case,

291
00:15:32,372 --> 00:15:34,878
because some of those
forensics guys probably...

292
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:36,040
Whoa!

293
00:15:36,717 --> 00:15:38,845
There's gonna be
forensics guys there?

294
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:41,650
All right,
pay attention.

295
00:15:41,651 --> 00:15:43,886
Eighteen months ago,
Camden McCallum

296
00:15:43,887 --> 00:15:47,295
ran his father's Cigarette boat
into the Morrow Bay aquarium.

297
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:49,460
That was right after he got caught
with that hockey player's wife.

298
00:15:49,461 --> 00:15:50,561
Yeah, I remember that.

299
00:15:50,562 --> 00:15:52,539
The guy hadn't been out
of the paper in five years.

300
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,042
Since that day, nothing.
Not a single news story.

301
00:15:55,043 --> 00:15:57,171
Not so much as
a dented motorcycle.

302
00:15:57,172 --> 00:15:59,376
Okay. What do you think?

303
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:02,347
I think Camden McCallum is too
good at what he does to stop.

304
00:16:02,348 --> 00:16:05,724
Not cold turkey, anyway.
Beautiful women, fast cars.

305
00:16:06,462 --> 00:16:09,058
It doesn't add up.
Something happened.

306
00:16:13,874 --> 00:16:15,102
How should we
introduce ourselves?

307
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,508
And don't say psychic,
they'll shut you off.

308
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:20,573
Say something vague, like
Alternative Tactics Division.

309
00:16:20,574 --> 00:16:23,849
How about the Bureau of
Magic and Spell-casting?

310
00:16:29,732 --> 00:16:31,222
Where you going?

311
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,975
You're rooting through the
trash? Just for a second.

312
00:16:37,976 --> 00:16:40,741
You are, without doubt, the
worst detective I've ever seen.

313
00:16:40,742 --> 00:16:42,750
Gus, everything you need
is right in front of you.

314
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,480
You just have to
pay attention.

315
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:45,817
Oh, yeah?

316
00:16:47,325 --> 00:16:48,816
Look at this.

317
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,594
Berenson's brand.

318
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:54,066
That is the highest quality
dog food on the market.

319
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:57,105
Perfect. They pamper their
pets. The case is almost solved.

320
00:16:57,106 --> 00:16:59,473
This stuff is really
expensive.

321
00:16:59,911 --> 00:17:02,210
No additives,
no preservatives.

322
00:17:02,849 --> 00:17:06,912
Why would you possibly open three bags
simultaneously, when you only have one dog?

323
00:17:06,913 --> 00:17:09,220
They're rich,
they waste money.

324
00:17:10,627 --> 00:17:11,719
Oh, my God!

325
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,889
What?

326
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,268
This CD case is totally nice.

327
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:17,394
Why would someone
throw this out?

328
00:17:17,395 --> 00:17:19,337
Here, put this in the car.

329
00:17:19,841 --> 00:17:21,207
Inside, now.

330
00:17:23,447 --> 00:17:25,312
Is it entirely too early
for me to have a theory?

331
00:17:25,313 --> 00:17:26,975
Can you at least wait
until we see some evidence?

332
00:17:26,976 --> 00:17:28,646
I suppose I could
if it'd make you happier.

333
00:17:30,786 --> 00:17:31,985
Whoa.

334
00:17:34,497 --> 00:17:36,398
Remember, just act natural.

335
00:17:46,349 --> 00:17:47,576
They know.

336
00:17:47,577 --> 00:17:48,811
How could they know?
They know.

337
00:17:48,812 --> 00:17:51,013
We haven't said anything
yet. They know, I can feel it.

338
00:17:51,014 --> 00:17:54,289
Oh, you're a psychic now,
too? You're not a psychic!

339
00:17:56,998 --> 00:17:58,761
Gus, let's just be clear
on one thing.

340
00:17:58,762 --> 00:18:01,703
The only way they can absolutely
prove that I am not a psychic,

341
00:18:01,704 --> 00:18:03,331
is if I tell them.

342
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:07,210
And I can guarantee you, that
is the one thing I will never do.

343
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,249
Check this out.

344
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:11,579
You got a lead?

345
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,987
No, but look at this girl.

346
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:19,188
She must be the sister.
Wow, she's incredible.

347
00:18:19,189 --> 00:18:21,792
We kind of have a few other
things going on right now, Shawn.

348
00:18:21,793 --> 00:18:23,703
Oh, Gus, look.

349
00:18:24,174 --> 00:18:26,904
Look how she went
from this awkward stage

350
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,946
with this really
unfortunate perm,

351
00:18:28,947 --> 00:18:31,483
to this beautiful,
amazing girl.

352
00:18:31,484 --> 00:18:33,486
I mean, she's a late bloomer,
but what does that mean?

353
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:36,081
That
means depth of character.

354
00:18:37,628 --> 00:18:39,824
Gus, she kayaks.

355
00:18:44,672 --> 00:18:46,903
What, are you
Lamaze breathing?

356
00:18:47,442 --> 00:18:48,670
It helps.

357
00:18:48,671 --> 00:18:50,337
I cover a few
birthing centers.

358
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:54,147
Just let me know when the
contractions are two minutes apart.

359
00:18:55,321 --> 00:18:57,723
She reads Vonnegut. Wow!

360
00:18:58,693 --> 00:19:04,157
She's an aviatrix. Gus, I
bet this girl is spectacular.

361
00:19:04,702 --> 00:19:06,432
Really, now?

362
00:19:09,076 --> 00:19:11,010
I'm Katarina McCallum.

363
00:19:11,011 --> 00:19:13,912
I am thoroughly
embarrassed.

364
00:19:13,913 --> 00:19:15,611
I'll bet you are.

365
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:20,484
I'm sorry. I'm Shawn Spencer.
The Chief called me in.

366
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,760
Everything's gonna be okay.

367
00:19:27,838 --> 00:19:31,970
Thank you for saying that.
I have the same feeling.

368
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,346
What makes you think so?

369
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:35,905
I'm a psychic.

370
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,276
They called in a psychic?

371
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:40,381
I have very unique
and special abilities.

372
00:19:41,058 --> 00:19:46,157
Well, Shawn Spencer, if you
need to ask any questions...

373
00:19:46,158 --> 00:19:47,530
Just one.

374
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,436
Do you currently
have a boyfriend?

375
00:19:53,344 --> 00:19:54,605
Is that pertinent?

376
00:19:54,606 --> 00:19:56,545
It very well could be.

377
00:19:56,982 --> 00:20:01,581
Well, yes, I'm sort of seeing
someone, nothing serious, though.

378
00:20:02,057 --> 00:20:03,821
Nothing too serious.

379
00:20:04,561 --> 00:20:06,826
That's good, that's very good.

380
00:20:09,468 --> 00:20:13,133
I think that's it for now.
I'll be in touch.

381
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,681
How do you luck into
these women all the time?

382
00:20:21,682 --> 00:20:25,954
Gus, please. I'm a professional,
gathering information.

383
00:20:29,499 --> 00:20:30,556
What are we looking for?

384
00:20:30,557 --> 00:20:33,069
Pictures of that
Katarina girl.

385
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,902
Preferably at the beach,
maybe on her way to yoga.

386
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:38,207
Or at a Halloween party,
dressed as a cat.

387
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,840
What are those for?
It's for anxiety.

388
00:20:40,841 --> 00:20:42,544
Is it ethical to sample
your own samples?

389
00:20:42,545 --> 00:20:45,749
Mr. Spencer, the sketch
artist is here for you.

390
00:20:46,058 --> 00:20:48,322
The sketch artist.
The Chief insisted.

391
00:20:48,323 --> 00:20:49,623
Interim Chief.

392
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:51,666
Yeah, you call her that.

393
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,200
I'll be right back.

394
00:20:56,173 --> 00:21:00,305
Oh, yeah, that's nice. Yeah, with
the shading... The shading's nice.

395
00:21:00,748 --> 00:21:01,805
Here's a question.

396
00:21:01,806 --> 00:21:04,112
Do you think you could have him
looking further to the left?

397
00:21:04,113 --> 00:21:06,085
Like, his eye-line
further to the left?

398
00:21:06,086 --> 00:21:07,213
Shawn?
Yeah?

399
00:21:07,214 --> 00:21:09,019
Can I talk to you for
a second? Yeah, yeah.

400
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:12,622
So, just more to the left and
I think we're there. All right.

401
00:21:13,433 --> 00:21:15,196
What's up?
What are you doing?

402
00:21:15,197 --> 00:21:16,293
Just work with me.

403
00:21:16,294 --> 00:21:17,838
Tell them you're blocked
or something.

404
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:20,307
I'm gonna have to
use that later.

405
00:21:20,308 --> 00:21:22,403
How we looking over there?

406
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:26,149
Oh, that's great, now...
Look how good that is!

407
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:29,951
See how he's looking off to the
left like he sees something.

408
00:21:29,952 --> 00:21:33,358
Now, as far as the hair goes,
can we get the bangs wispier,

409
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,796
like he's trying to
compensate for, like,

410
00:21:34,797 --> 00:21:37,461
maybe he's thinning in the back
and he's sort of got a swoop?

411
00:21:39,301 --> 00:21:42,435
Oh, my gosh! It's Bill!
Oh, it's Bill!

412
00:21:42,978 --> 00:21:45,413
Oh, honey! Come here,
Bill's the kidnapper!

413
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:50,052
That's the exact cap
I gave him!

414
00:21:50,824 --> 00:21:52,656
Okay, everybody stop.

415
00:21:55,598 --> 00:21:59,468
No, no! I'm sorry.
Bill is not the kidnapper.

416
00:22:00,105 --> 00:22:03,041
Not the kidnapper. Bill is
just a horrible human being.

417
00:22:03,042 --> 00:22:06,569
Who is Bill?
I'm getting multiple women.

418
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,775
Is he a bigamist? A pimp?

419
00:22:08,776 --> 00:22:11,686
Does he sell children on
the black market? What...

420
00:22:16,697 --> 00:22:18,165
Mr. McCallum?

421
00:22:18,566 --> 00:22:21,059
I'm Shawn Spencer,
the psychic.

422
00:22:22,339 --> 00:22:25,241
Well, thank you for coming.
If there's anything I can do.

423
00:22:25,242 --> 00:22:28,577
I can't imagine how difficult
this must be for you, sir.

424
00:22:29,517 --> 00:22:34,253
Nothing can prepare you for something
like this, knowing you can't do anything.

425
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:38,190
Call me anytime
with any questions.

426
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:41,200
Actually, I do have
one question, sir.

427
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,601
How did he feel
about the dog?

428
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:47,467
Well, he loved
that damn thing.

429
00:22:47,468 --> 00:22:49,810
Didn't do anything
without it.

430
00:22:50,448 --> 00:22:52,975
Yeah. That'll do it.
Thank you, sir.

431
00:22:56,181 --> 00:22:58,954
Does he like his dog?
That's how you investigate?

432
00:22:58,955 --> 00:23:00,929
I think we're
making progress.

433
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:03,125
Since you've been here, all you've
done is dig through the trash,

434
00:23:03,126 --> 00:23:06,001
hit on the victim's sister, and
falsely accuse her boyfriend.

435
00:23:06,002 --> 00:23:07,437
Gus, he is not
her boyfriend.

436
00:23:07,438 --> 00:23:09,807
She made a point to say they're
free to see other people.

437
00:23:09,808 --> 00:23:12,872
Whatever you say, Shawn.
Have a blast. I quit.

438
00:23:13,651 --> 00:23:15,083
You can't quit.
We just got started.

439
00:23:15,084 --> 00:23:16,485
Watch me.

440
00:23:19,093 --> 00:23:21,460
Gus, you're gonna
miss everything.

441
00:23:22,164 --> 00:23:23,689
It's gonna be fun.

442
00:23:25,561 --> 00:23:27,434
Gus, get back here!

443
00:23:36,086 --> 00:23:37,212
Fine.

444
00:23:38,122 --> 00:23:40,353
I'll solve this case
by myself.

445
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:20,677
Gus,

446
00:24:21,789 --> 00:24:24,087
I hate to imagine what
the rest of your plan was.

447
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:25,889
How did you get in?

448
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:31,402
Far less effective on
a second-floor landing.

449
00:24:33,006 --> 00:24:33,995
What do you want, Shawn?

450
00:24:33,996 --> 00:24:36,305
Can I say something about
the case, please? No.

451
00:24:36,306 --> 00:24:38,505
I was right.
I'm done, Shawn.

452
00:24:38,506 --> 00:24:40,981
I don't want to commit felonies,
and perjury, and pretend to be...

453
00:24:40,982 --> 00:24:42,848
You're dying to know who
kidnapped him, I know you are.

454
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:43,910
No, no, I'm not.

455
00:24:43,911 --> 00:24:46,082
Because I don't believe that you
can solve a crime the cops can't

456
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:47,421
by simply walking
through a house.

457
00:24:47,422 --> 00:24:48,996
Fine.
Fine.

458
00:25:01,649 --> 00:25:03,413
All right, whatever.

459
00:25:04,488 --> 00:25:06,150
Who kidnapped him?

460
00:25:06,758 --> 00:25:07,987
Nobody.

461
00:25:08,494 --> 00:25:10,759
Nobody. Excellent.

462
00:25:11,064 --> 00:25:13,533
Call the Chief at home,
tell her the crime is solved.

463
00:25:13,534 --> 00:25:16,127
Because, apparently, we just
imagined the whole thing.

464
00:25:16,128 --> 00:25:21,009
Gus, nobody kidnapped him
because he did it himself.

465
00:25:26,555 --> 00:25:28,615
Come on, see for yourself.

466
00:25:28,992 --> 00:25:30,893
Okay, here's the thing.

467
00:25:31,328 --> 00:25:34,321
Camden didn't offer to clean
up his act voluntarily.

468
00:25:34,322 --> 00:25:37,700
Oh, no. Daddy threatened
to cut him off permanently.

469
00:25:37,701 --> 00:25:39,466
This was about
18 months ago.

470
00:25:39,467 --> 00:25:41,703
Eighteen months?
But wait, there's more.

471
00:25:41,704 --> 00:25:43,406
He had help.
Who?

472
00:25:44,615 --> 00:25:47,813
This guy on the end.
Malcolm Orso.

473
00:25:47,814 --> 00:25:52,222
Only member of this crew that didn't
go on to fame, or fortune, or rehab.

474
00:25:52,223 --> 00:25:54,194
The cops must've
talked to him. Nope.

475
00:25:54,195 --> 00:25:56,994
Malcolm hasn't been seen with
Camden for quite some time.

476
00:25:56,995 --> 00:25:59,593
To be exact...
Eighteen months.

477
00:25:59,594 --> 00:26:01,537
Almost to the day.

478
00:26:01,538 --> 00:26:04,373
Gus, he has been planning
this thing for almost a year.

479
00:26:04,374 --> 00:26:05,606
Shawn, this is good.

480
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:06,774
Yeah.

481
00:26:07,818 --> 00:26:10,343
Where did you get this?
Katarina McCallum's room.

482
00:26:10,344 --> 00:26:11,787
You didn't go in her room!

483
00:26:11,788 --> 00:26:14,953
Gus, I needed a ride.
She hadn't eaten yet.

484
00:26:14,954 --> 00:26:16,894
One thing led to another, and
we ended up sharing a milkshake.

485
00:26:16,895 --> 00:26:19,161
Whoa! Wait a second!
Wait a second.

486
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:21,295
You're dating her?
No, not dating.

487
00:26:21,296 --> 00:26:22,772
Yes, you are!

488
00:26:23,075 --> 00:26:24,839
It's not exclusive.

489
00:26:25,678 --> 00:26:27,771
What? Gus! Come on!

490
00:26:27,772 --> 00:26:30,909
Put some clothes on. This
is gonna be fun. Let's go.

491
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:33,183
I'm driving,
where are your keys?

492
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,119
Never mind! I got them!

493
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,323
Should I slice
this up for the road?

494
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:55,145
Well, we're off
to a banner start.

495
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:57,284
Just let me do
the talking.

496
00:26:58,863 --> 00:26:59,989
Morning, gentlemen.

497
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,590
Hello, Officer.

498
00:27:04,438 --> 00:27:05,838
What's this?

499
00:27:06,441 --> 00:27:07,636
Oops!

500
00:27:08,644 --> 00:27:10,805
That's my dad's old
police business card,

501
00:27:10,806 --> 00:27:12,576
must've stuck
at the back there.

502
00:27:12,577 --> 00:27:14,676
I guess I've been carrying
that in my wallet for ages.

503
00:27:14,677 --> 00:27:16,813
Can never be too careful,
coming from a family of cops.

504
00:27:16,814 --> 00:27:18,483
Henry Spencer's your dad?

505
00:27:18,484 --> 00:27:19,651
Yes, yes, he is.

506
00:27:19,652 --> 00:27:20,922
Well, how's old Henry doing?

507
00:27:20,923 --> 00:27:24,400
Oh, you know Henry,
he's great.

508
00:27:24,836 --> 00:27:26,828
Retired, living in Miami.

509
00:27:27,073 --> 00:27:30,009
I saw Henry three weeks ago
at the Home Depot.

510
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:33,048
Yeah, yeah,
that sounds about right.

511
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:35,244
He popped into town
for a few days,

512
00:27:35,245 --> 00:27:37,811
grabbed some supplies,
some wood.

513
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:41,755
He said he'd been back
for over a year.

514
00:27:42,296 --> 00:27:44,026
And now, he's back.

515
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,795
Running around, doing
his thing, Henry-style.

516
00:27:52,912 --> 00:27:55,210
Tell your dad
"the kingfisher" says hello.

517
00:27:55,211 --> 00:27:57,410
Will do.
Thank you, Officer.

518
00:27:59,455 --> 00:28:01,515
Your dad's back
at the house?

519
00:28:01,516 --> 00:28:03,058
Apparently.

520
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:10,495
Dude, I'm so excited. This is
my first use of spy technology.

521
00:28:10,496 --> 00:28:11,596
Yeah, it would seem
much cooler

522
00:28:11,597 --> 00:28:14,509
<i>if it didn't have Sports
Illustrated pasted on the side.</i>

523
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:17,071
It came with
the subscription.

524
00:28:18,352 --> 00:28:19,579
Are you gonna
tell me why we're here?

525
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,746
This is the Orso
family cabin,

526
00:28:21,747 --> 00:28:25,624
where young Malcolm and young Camden
spent all their summers growing up.

527
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:27,459
Wouldn't the police
have checked this out?

528
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,001
Malcolm is so far out on the
periphery of Camden's life.

529
00:28:30,002 --> 00:28:33,633
He's not on the witness list,
he's not on anybody's list.

530
00:28:34,476 --> 00:28:36,274
This is a great plan.

531
00:28:36,879 --> 00:28:39,406
Camden McCallum
deserves to be commended.

532
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:41,346
Maybe you should
date him, too.

533
00:28:41,347 --> 00:28:42,717
Maybe I will.

534
00:28:42,718 --> 00:28:45,452
Let me see.
Let me see here.

535
00:28:49,733 --> 00:28:51,394
Oh, no way!
What?

536
00:28:51,395 --> 00:28:52,959
It's Camden's dog!

537
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,097
Get... Dude! Dude.
Oh, my gosh!

538
00:28:55,098 --> 00:28:57,609
I can't believe we did this!
This is unbelievable!

539
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,838
What! What!

540
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:01,405
Okay, okay, wait. Look. Okay,
wait. Let's call the cops.

541
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,042
No, no, no,
let's call the Chief!

542
00:29:03,043 --> 00:29:05,555
That's what we're gonna do.
Call the Chief. Yeah!

543
00:29:05,556 --> 00:29:07,592
No, no, no. No, no,
no. Gus, Gus! What?

544
00:29:07,593 --> 00:29:09,321
We don't call anyone.
What?

545
00:29:09,322 --> 00:29:11,227
Then later,
at headquarters,

546
00:29:11,228 --> 00:29:13,563
I suddenly and miraculously
have a vision.

547
00:29:13,564 --> 00:29:15,661
A vision?
A vision of stuff we saw!

548
00:29:15,662 --> 00:29:18,504
Like the road sign
with the two bullet holes.

549
00:29:18,505 --> 00:29:21,444
Like the red kayak, the
yellow kayak, and the highway.

550
00:29:21,445 --> 00:29:22,948
With numbers?
Oh, I'm seeing...

551
00:29:22,949 --> 00:29:25,042
What am I seeing?
Eight, three, one...

552
00:29:25,043 --> 00:29:26,314
We're on Highway 138.

553
00:29:26,315 --> 00:29:29,655
Exactly. In the spirit world, things
get jumbled and out of sequence.

554
00:29:29,656 --> 00:29:31,389
But my premonition
becomes clearer

555
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:34,332
when we all jump in
the squad car together.

556
00:29:34,535 --> 00:29:36,230
By the way, let me sit next
to that junior detective...

557
00:29:36,231 --> 00:29:37,293
Shawn, please.

558
00:29:37,294 --> 00:29:39,102
And, alas,
we'd lead them here.

559
00:29:39,103 --> 00:29:42,077
And finally, we both put on
our surprised faces

560
00:29:42,078 --> 00:29:45,242
as I guide them to the cabin
for the first time.

561
00:29:46,187 --> 00:29:47,518
This is mine.

562
00:29:51,694 --> 00:29:53,128
What do you got?

563
00:29:56,735 --> 00:30:00,195
Gus, that's horrible! It
doesn't convey surprise at all!

564
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:02,135
Gus!

565
00:30:03,046 --> 00:30:04,980
All right, let me
do the talking.

566
00:30:04,981 --> 00:30:06,037
Is there even an option?

567
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:08,550
No, I want a lot of witnesses
for my miraculous vision.

568
00:30:08,551 --> 00:30:11,216
Yeah, yeah. There they go.
There they go. Detectives!

569
00:30:11,525 --> 00:30:14,963
Detectives! Detectives!
We have a breakthrough.

570
00:30:15,631 --> 00:30:16,962
It is very important.

571
00:30:16,963 --> 00:30:18,967
I also have something
important, I call it lunch.

572
00:30:18,968 --> 00:30:20,025
Make an appointment.

573
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:22,232
No, no, but this is...
You don't have my interest.

574
00:30:22,233 --> 00:30:23,707
You don't have my ear.

575
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:27,270
Find a beat cop, tell your
story, maybe I'll read the report.

576
00:30:27,271 --> 00:30:29,649
Good day, gentlemen.
After you.

577
00:30:31,322 --> 00:30:32,653
Detective,

578
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,466
don't eat the chicken.

579
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:46,942
"Don't eat the chicken"?

580
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:56,855
He's got your number.

581
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:58,395
He's got nothing.

582
00:30:58,396 --> 00:31:00,989
I'll have the chicken
enchilada, extra chicken.

583
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,125
Okay.

584
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:04,170
I'll have the cheese
quesadilla. Coming right up.

585
00:31:04,171 --> 00:31:05,433
Coward.

586
00:31:05,434 --> 00:31:07,974
You're mad because
he pegged us as a couple.

587
00:31:07,975 --> 00:31:11,174
Please, he was tipped off.
Did you tell anyone?

588
00:31:11,175 --> 00:31:12,945
Why would I tell anyone?

589
00:31:12,946 --> 00:31:15,749
Let everyone think I'm working
my way up the ladder the hard way?

590
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,450
You're barely separated!

591
00:31:17,451 --> 00:31:19,427
It's been five months!

592
00:31:26,707 --> 00:31:29,609
So, the plan was to annoy
them into believing you.

593
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:31,475
Billy Camp's
working the grill.

594
00:31:31,476 --> 00:31:32,606
So?

595
00:31:32,917 --> 00:31:33,975
So?

596
00:31:34,653 --> 00:31:37,817
Billy Camp has the worst
hay fever I've ever seen.

597
00:31:38,726 --> 00:31:41,491
Feel this wind? Feel it?

598
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:56,846
I'll be right back.

599
00:31:58,722 --> 00:32:00,988
Here we go. Act natural.

600
00:32:03,497 --> 00:32:05,329
Okay, what is it?

601
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,315
All right, this is great.
Now what?

602
00:32:20,316 --> 00:32:22,722
Does anyone have
any binoculars?

603
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,459
No. No, you see, we
don't carry binoculars.

604
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:28,592
Oh, never mind, I found
some here in my pocket.

605
00:32:33,443 --> 00:32:36,437
There it is!
Just like I saw it!

606
00:32:45,194 --> 00:32:47,025
You wanna tell me what
I'm looking for, please?

607
00:32:47,026 --> 00:32:49,931
I'm not sure, exactly.

608
00:32:49,932 --> 00:32:52,537
I see a bone.

609
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:54,165
What, a human bone?

610
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:58,646
No, no, rawhide,
and a ball.

611
00:33:01,586 --> 00:33:02,952
Holy crap.

612
00:33:03,722 --> 00:33:05,384
Call for backup.

613
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:07,259
What?

614
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,131
What do you see,
Detective?

615
00:33:34,269 --> 00:33:36,465
I can't believe they won't
let us in. This is lame.

616
00:33:36,466 --> 00:33:39,600
And you were so polite when you asked
the SWAT team to issue you the Luger.

617
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:40,735
Just make sure you
act in awe of me

618
00:33:40,736 --> 00:33:42,575
when they come to say
I was completely right.

619
00:33:42,576 --> 00:33:46,086
Oh, and maybe a little afraid, like my
powers could possibly be used for evil.

620
00:33:46,087 --> 00:33:47,917
Oh, watch out! Watch out!
Whoa, whoa!

621
00:33:47,918 --> 00:33:49,958
For what, its tongue?

622
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:51,289
That thing could be vicious!

623
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:55,629
Yeah, and diabolical with its
calculated decoy tail-wagging.

624
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,192
There's blood on its whiskers.

625
00:33:57,193 --> 00:33:59,432
That's not blood, that's
Snausages. Are you sure?

626
00:33:59,433 --> 00:34:00,839
Yes, I'm sure. Either that,
or he just mauled

627
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,571
a mountain lion.
Come on, Gus.

628
00:34:02,572 --> 00:34:04,512
Mr. Spencer, follow me.

629
00:34:08,722 --> 00:34:12,454
Now, if there's any press, make
sure you mention our agency.

630
00:34:12,455 --> 00:34:14,255
We don't have an agency.
Yes, we do.

631
00:34:14,256 --> 00:34:16,024
I applied for a DBA online,

632
00:34:16,025 --> 00:34:17,692
which reminds me,
we're gonna need a name.

633
00:34:17,693 --> 00:34:19,931
"Mindmasters"?
Already taken.

634
00:34:20,373 --> 00:34:22,739
Make sure you tell them
that we do private cases,

635
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:25,245
because I bet the department's only
gonna be good for one or two a month.

636
00:34:25,246 --> 00:34:26,838
You tell them.
I can't.

637
00:34:26,839 --> 00:34:29,750
I'm secretive,
mysterious, enigmatic.

638
00:34:29,751 --> 00:34:32,724
Delusional.
Remember, act surprised.

639
00:34:36,555 --> 00:34:40,798
Wow, it is just
like I saw before.

640
00:35:09,548 --> 00:35:12,348
Pardon me, ladies, gentlemen.

641
00:35:21,567 --> 00:35:22,590
The department
has been approved

642
00:35:22,591 --> 00:35:25,070
to call on you again,
Mr. Spencer.

643
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:28,469
And even though this case didn't
end up exactly the way we'd hoped,

644
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,171
I thank you for
your services.

645
00:35:30,172 --> 00:35:32,238
You were invaluable.
Thank you.

646
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:33,613
Thank you.

647
00:35:33,614 --> 00:35:36,120
You're making a huge mistake.
This case isn't closed.

648
00:35:36,121 --> 00:35:37,213
Pardon me?

649
00:35:37,214 --> 00:35:40,228
Murder, suicide?
Come on, you're buying that?

650
00:35:40,563 --> 00:35:43,557
I'm not buying anything.
Those are the facts.

651
00:35:43,935 --> 00:35:45,095
I buy it.

652
00:35:45,771 --> 00:35:47,739
I understand, I do.

653
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:51,336
You'd like to shut the book on this
as quickly as possible. That's fine.

654
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,740
They had a falling-out.

655
00:35:54,741 --> 00:35:57,252
Before they got
the ransom money? Why?

656
00:35:57,253 --> 00:35:59,449
What did they have to fight
about before they got the cash?

657
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:02,756
Might I remind you, Mr.
Spencer, you are not a detective.

658
00:36:02,757 --> 00:36:04,559
I just need to speak
to the witnesses again.

659
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,195
The McCallum family has been through
enough, and this conversation is over.

660
00:36:08,196 --> 00:36:12,334
Thank you. We parked in the
parking structure, do you validate?

661
00:36:12,335 --> 00:36:13,777
Would it make any difference
if I told you

662
00:36:13,778 --> 00:36:16,180
Camden McCallum, Jr.
Spoke to me?

663
00:36:18,654 --> 00:36:20,122
From beyond the grave.

664
00:36:22,059 --> 00:36:24,221
Shut the door
on your way out.

665
00:36:24,597 --> 00:36:25,825
Damn it.

666
00:36:30,038 --> 00:36:31,903
What are you doing?
That was the Chief of Police.

667
00:36:31,904 --> 00:36:33,407
Interim Chief.

668
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,776
And have you considered that
Camden McCallum may have been alive

669
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,246
the first time
we went to that cabin?

670
00:36:37,247 --> 00:36:38,716
No.
Well, I have!

671
00:36:44,794 --> 00:36:46,819
I need to talk to that guy.
Whoa, whoa, no!

672
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,387
Come on, Gus,
just for a second.

673
00:36:48,388 --> 00:36:50,332
The man is practically
almost my father-in-law.

674
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:53,135
Make no mistake, Shawn,
I will kill you.

675
00:36:54,008 --> 00:36:58,036
Okay, I appreciate the fact that
you think you can beat me up.

676
00:36:58,037 --> 00:37:00,879
But I think our last scuffle
proves otherwise.

677
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,420
Are you talking about
the Cinnamon Festival?

678
00:37:02,421 --> 00:37:03,854
Yes! You do remember!

679
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:06,950
Okay, first of all, I was
six, and I had a cast!

680
00:37:06,951 --> 00:37:09,189
Which many would construe
as a clear advantage.

681
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:12,258
It's like having a weapon
attached to your arm.

682
00:37:12,259 --> 00:37:15,433
Oh, great, now the Chief
is staring right at us.

683
00:37:16,676 --> 00:37:18,975
Mr. McCallum?
Chief wants him left alone.

684
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,206
Well, we all want
to be left alone.

685
00:37:20,207 --> 00:37:22,045
Yeah, some more than others.

686
00:37:22,046 --> 00:37:23,210
What's with his wrist?

687
00:37:23,211 --> 00:37:24,379
You don't give up, do you?

688
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:28,292
I do give up, all the time. But
not until the moment is right.

689
00:37:28,929 --> 00:37:32,458
Now, come on, I know you don't
think this adds up, either.

690
00:37:35,238 --> 00:37:38,141
Okay, rumor is,
he tried to off himself.

691
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:39,937
Off himself.

692
00:37:41,482 --> 00:37:44,042
The war hero? The man
who's seen everything?

693
00:37:44,043 --> 00:37:46,850
No, that's not it.
That's definitely not it.

694
00:37:46,851 --> 00:37:48,322
You know everything,
don't you?

695
00:37:48,323 --> 00:37:50,793
Yeah.
It's scary, isn't it?

696
00:37:50,794 --> 00:37:54,800
Look, something is going on, and
I'm gonna find out what it is.

697
00:37:54,801 --> 00:37:57,497
No, you're not going
anywhere near that man.

698
00:37:57,498 --> 00:37:59,507
In fact, I'm gonna
make certain

699
00:37:59,508 --> 00:38:00,736
you never hear from
the department again.

700
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:02,006
Whoa!

701
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,881
I'm getting strong vibrations
that you might be wrong.

702
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:06,009
I'm onto you.

703
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:08,554
You've got a source somewhere,
and I'm gonna find it.

704
00:38:08,555 --> 00:38:09,954
You think this is
some sort of game?

705
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:11,287
I'm not gonna let you
just waltz around here

706
00:38:11,288 --> 00:38:13,226
like some kid
in a candy store.

707
00:38:13,227 --> 00:38:15,822
Let me be honest with you,
Detective.

708
00:38:15,823 --> 00:38:19,395
I used to work in a candy store,
and it's nothing like this.

709
00:38:24,381 --> 00:38:26,316
You're in over your head,
mystic.

710
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:49,846
Hi, Dad.

711
00:38:50,053 --> 00:38:51,214
Shawn.

712
00:38:53,158 --> 00:38:55,023
You didn't tell me
you moved back.

713
00:38:55,024 --> 00:38:56,493
You didn't tell me
you moved away.

714
00:38:56,494 --> 00:38:58,395
That was different.
Was it?

715
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:02,065
Yeah, I was busy trying to
help my mom through her divorce.

716
00:39:02,066 --> 00:39:04,665
Well, it's nice to
see you, too, son.

717
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,576
Can I come in?

718
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:08,173
No.

719
00:39:12,855 --> 00:39:14,583
I was on my way
out to lunch.

720
00:39:14,584 --> 00:39:17,856
You can come with me
if you don't bring this thing.

721
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,738
When I was in the department, there
were two things I hated in this world.

722
00:39:27,739 --> 00:39:30,338
Private investigators,
and psychics.

723
00:39:31,316 --> 00:39:32,578
Congratulations, kid.

724
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,517
You just hit the
disappointment exacta.

725
00:39:34,518 --> 00:39:35,782
Thank you,
thank you very much.

726
00:39:35,783 --> 00:39:37,222
It sort of happened
by accident.

727
00:39:37,223 --> 00:39:39,921
What are you gonna do when you
get caught? Move out of town?

728
00:39:39,922 --> 00:39:41,361
I'm not gonna get caught.

729
00:39:41,362 --> 00:39:42,922
Shawn, this is just like
everything else.

730
00:39:42,923 --> 00:39:45,265
Three months from now, you're gonna
be on a bus going to Minneapolis

731
00:39:45,266 --> 00:39:47,306
'cause you found your calling
as a weatherman.

732
00:39:47,307 --> 00:39:49,934
It's not like that this time.
Have you been listening to me?

733
00:39:49,935 --> 00:39:53,072
I've finally figured out a
way to use my special gift.

734
00:39:53,073 --> 00:39:56,451
You should be thrilled! You're
the one that made me this way.

735
00:39:58,358 --> 00:39:59,826
I'm good at this.

736
00:40:00,728 --> 00:40:02,855
Oh, I see,
you're so good at it,

737
00:40:02,856 --> 00:40:05,025
what are you doing
knocking at my door?

738
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:07,769
You think I came
to you for help.

739
00:40:11,378 --> 00:40:12,436
Okay.

740
00:40:13,848 --> 00:40:15,407
There was no ransom drop.

741
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:20,049
I'm not gonna be
a part of this.

742
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,185
Come on, would you
just hear me out?

743
00:40:24,598 --> 00:40:27,158
Okay, no ransom drop,
so what? Big deal.

744
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:29,568
So, six days, nothing?
Not even a demand?

745
00:40:29,569 --> 00:40:31,938
It happens all the time.
That's not unprecedented.

746
00:40:31,939 --> 00:40:33,477
They try to create panic
in the family.

747
00:40:33,478 --> 00:40:34,910
Yeah, I know, I know.
But not this guy.

748
00:40:34,911 --> 00:40:37,609
This guy wanted it done
quickly. I know that.

749
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:39,916
Well, then you
missed something.

750
00:40:40,222 --> 00:40:42,748
You've been driving your
motorcycle all across the country,

751
00:40:42,749 --> 00:40:45,318
working your bungee cord jumping
expeditions, you're soft.

752
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:47,126
Hey, pal, it happens.

753
00:40:47,127 --> 00:40:48,759
I'm not soft.

754
00:40:49,069 --> 00:40:50,900
I'm sharper than
I've ever been.

755
00:40:50,901 --> 00:40:52,565
Close your eyes.

756
00:40:55,813 --> 00:40:56,972
No way, I'm not seven.

757
00:40:56,973 --> 00:41:00,211
Close your eyes. Any longer,
I'll think you're cheating.

758
00:41:06,729 --> 00:41:08,961
How many hats are in the room?

759
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:10,701
All right, fine.

760
00:41:11,937 --> 00:41:13,928
Just in case you're trying
to pull a fast one,

761
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:16,534
I'm not counting
the one in your pocket.

762
00:41:23,154 --> 00:41:25,349
Nylon fishing hat on
the loner in the corner.

763
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,857
Foam cap on the kid
who's too young to know

764
00:41:26,858 --> 00:41:28,918
they were lame the first
time they came out.

765
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:31,660
Both truckers. One a concrete
company I've never heard of,

766
00:41:31,661 --> 00:41:33,930
the other advertising
free mustache rides.

767
00:41:33,931 --> 00:41:36,166
I'm fairly certain no one's
taken him up on that offer.

768
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:38,106
Norwegian girl, ponytail
pulled out the back.

769
00:41:38,107 --> 00:41:39,508
Unfortunately,
she's married,

770
00:41:39,509 --> 00:41:43,575
and our friendly bartender, wearing
the official hat of the restaurant.

771
00:41:44,755 --> 00:41:46,017
Six hats.

772
00:41:46,391 --> 00:41:47,483
And?

773
00:41:47,993 --> 00:41:49,221
That's it.

774
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:51,360
Sorry, pal,
there are seven hats.

775
00:41:51,361 --> 00:41:53,023
I can't help you.
You missed something.

776
00:41:53,024 --> 00:41:55,034
I didn't miss anything.
There are seven hats, Shawn.

777
00:41:55,035 --> 00:41:57,504
Were. Before I closed
my eyes.

778
00:41:57,505 --> 00:42:01,376
Cowboy-hat walked out while I
was ridiculing mustache-rides.

779
00:42:02,782 --> 00:42:04,877
Come on, I heard her boots.

780
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,054
All right, close enough.

781
00:42:12,297 --> 00:42:14,630
Close enough?
No, I nailed that.

782
00:42:15,001 --> 00:42:16,468
Yeah, but you
changed the rules.

783
00:42:16,469 --> 00:42:18,768
But, hey,
if it makes you happy.

784
00:42:19,875 --> 00:42:22,503
Changed the rules? I did
not change the rules.

785
00:42:22,504 --> 00:42:25,241
What I did was nail it,
and you know it!

786
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:28,082
Shawn, you want my advice?

787
00:42:29,223 --> 00:42:31,852
Go out, get yourself
a real job, grow up.

788
00:42:32,828 --> 00:42:34,193
In the meantime,

789
00:42:34,194 --> 00:42:36,231
you might wanna ask yourself
who you're trusting in this case

790
00:42:36,232 --> 00:42:38,098
and maybe you shouldn't.

791
00:42:38,804 --> 00:42:41,637
'Cause obviously,
you're overlooking somebody.

792
00:42:41,638 --> 00:42:43,336
Thanks for lunch.

793
00:42:50,622 --> 00:42:52,055
Why are we at the
McCallum offices?

794
00:42:52,056 --> 00:42:54,025
What is the magnification
on these things?

795
00:42:54,026 --> 00:42:55,151
Two X.

796
00:42:55,152 --> 00:42:57,562
Okay, we need to stop at
Wal-Mart on the way home.

797
00:42:57,563 --> 00:42:59,658
Why don't you just take
your big, loud motorcycle?

798
00:42:59,659 --> 00:43:01,897
Oh, here we go,
here we go!

799
00:43:01,898 --> 00:43:03,167
Oh, hell, no!

800
00:43:03,168 --> 00:43:04,971
You got me out of work
so you could stalk a girl?

801
00:43:04,972 --> 00:43:06,706
Damn it,
what is he doing here?

802
00:43:06,707 --> 00:43:07,838
I can't believe this.

803
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:10,316
What's up with his hair?
It's horrible.

804
00:43:10,317 --> 00:43:12,650
I knew I should've had him
picked up for questioning.

805
00:43:12,651 --> 00:43:14,850
That is not the way a grown
man kisses a grown woman.

806
00:43:14,851 --> 00:43:16,258
We're fine.

807
00:43:17,864 --> 00:43:19,890
Why does she look so nervous?

808
00:43:21,503 --> 00:43:22,662
Oh, no.

809
00:43:22,663 --> 00:43:24,669
Is it just me, or does that
bag look like it's filled

810
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:26,835
with stacks of ransom money?

811
00:43:27,245 --> 00:43:28,712
Give me that.

812
00:43:30,616 --> 00:43:31,708
Oh, my God!

813
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:32,980
Katarina...

814
00:43:34,122 --> 00:43:35,488
It was her!

815
00:43:36,392 --> 00:43:37,689
You're dating a murderer.

816
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:39,592
Not exclusively.
Wow.

817
00:43:48,111 --> 00:43:50,944
You see, I knew there was a
reason she went for you so easily.

818
00:43:50,945 --> 00:43:53,643
She wasn't lying, Gus. I
know when people are lying.

819
00:43:53,644 --> 00:43:56,655
Oh, yeah? Apparently not.
You just got played.

820
00:44:03,901 --> 00:44:05,129
Should we call the cops?

821
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:06,363
Too late for that.

822
00:44:06,364 --> 00:44:09,340
You could pretend you had a vision
of a girl totally manipulating you.

823
00:44:09,341 --> 00:44:10,741
Would you stop?

824
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:12,638
Thanks...

825
00:44:13,649 --> 00:44:16,245
What should we do?
What should we do?

826
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:18,889
There's only one thing to do.

827
00:44:26,169 --> 00:44:28,604
Oh, you have got
to be kidding me.

828
00:44:34,147 --> 00:44:35,240
Shawn?

829
00:44:35,983 --> 00:44:36,973
Hey!

830
00:44:42,427 --> 00:44:43,552
What are you doing?
Helping.

831
00:44:43,553 --> 00:44:45,255
You're supposed to stay in
the car! You didn't tell me!

832
00:44:45,256 --> 00:44:46,492
Well, come on!

833
00:44:47,835 --> 00:44:49,894
Gus, you locked the car?
It's a bad neighborhood!

834
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:51,906
What in the world
is going on, Shawn?

835
00:44:51,907 --> 00:44:53,875
I know what's in the bag.

836
00:44:53,876 --> 00:44:55,140
You do?

837
00:44:55,414 --> 00:44:57,440
You're good, very good.

838
00:44:57,784 --> 00:45:00,548
I didn't consider who would be the
sole heir to the McCallum fortune

839
00:45:00,549 --> 00:45:02,988
if Camden was
out of the picture.

840
00:45:02,989 --> 00:45:04,459
Wait, okay, hold on.

841
00:45:04,962 --> 00:45:07,430
You think I want
my family's money?

842
00:45:07,431 --> 00:45:09,591
Well, you don't need it,
do you?

843
00:45:09,592 --> 00:45:12,195
Now that you've got
this money!

844
00:45:26,361 --> 00:45:28,421
We've got to get
better binoculars.

845
00:45:41,584 --> 00:45:42,677
Katarina...

846
00:46:00,847 --> 00:46:02,372
Go buy the bag.

847
00:46:03,618 --> 00:46:05,518
What, you want a souvenir
of your ineptitude?

848
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:07,418
I need to get a better look
inside the bag.

849
00:46:07,419 --> 00:46:10,689
I'm not going in there.
That guy wants to kill us.

850
00:46:10,896 --> 00:46:13,889
Gus, this guy works
in a thrift store. Okay?

851
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:16,766
He's a big, furry-hearted,
Good Samaritan.

852
00:46:17,573 --> 00:46:20,202
Come on, I'll be right here.

853
00:46:23,649 --> 00:46:24,776
Go ahead.

854
00:46:25,452 --> 00:46:26,544
Mmm-hmm.

855
00:46:38,338 --> 00:46:39,897
What the hell do you want?

856
00:46:41,744 --> 00:46:43,302
Can I have the bag?

857
00:46:43,913 --> 00:46:45,072
Are you serious?

858
00:46:45,073 --> 00:46:47,380
Just the bag, not the clothes.

859
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:49,984
I'll pay you for it.

860
00:46:51,525 --> 00:46:54,359
Oh, you've got some nerve
coming in here.

861
00:46:57,667 --> 00:46:58,861
I can't believe this.

862
00:46:58,862 --> 00:47:00,528
Neither can I.

863
00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:02,801
I've gone to jail
for less than you.

864
00:47:02,802 --> 00:47:04,434
Jail's no fun,
I'll tell you that much.

865
00:47:04,435 --> 00:47:07,277
Oh, you've been?
Once, in Monopoly.

866
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,442
Okay, hold on, hold on!
Who's that?

867
00:47:15,462 --> 00:47:17,020
Hey, hey!

868
00:47:17,565 --> 00:47:19,295
Hey! Get back here!

869
00:47:28,549 --> 00:47:29,777
Go, go, go!

870
00:47:31,586 --> 00:47:32,985
I can't believe you
sold me out like that!

871
00:47:32,986 --> 00:47:34,215
You didn't tell me
I was a decoy!

872
00:47:34,216 --> 00:47:35,953
Of course you're the decoy!

873
00:47:50,615 --> 00:47:51,912
It seems pretty clean.

874
00:47:51,913 --> 00:47:55,114
What, they didn't happen to
leave a ransom note inside?

875
00:47:55,923 --> 00:47:57,288
Give me some money.
Get your own money.

876
00:47:57,289 --> 00:47:59,260
Gus, I'll give it back.

877
00:48:06,974 --> 00:48:09,170
Seriously,
this is all you carry?

878
00:48:11,348 --> 00:48:17,118
Okay, so, we've got
five stacks going across,

879
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:19,591
and you figure
four going longways.

880
00:48:19,827 --> 00:48:23,423
Ten stacks in each pile, based
on the wear and the indentation.

881
00:48:23,424 --> 00:48:26,263
I don't know, depending
on the denomination,

882
00:48:26,264 --> 00:48:28,703
this could easily be
$5 million.

883
00:48:28,704 --> 00:48:30,799
You're kidding.
Yeah, give or take.

884
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,606
You got that from the groove
on the side?

885
00:48:32,607 --> 00:48:36,516
Oh, come on, Gus. Any small child
could have figured that out.

886
00:48:38,856 --> 00:48:40,687
So somebody at that house
did pay a ransom.

887
00:48:40,688 --> 00:48:42,523
Mmm-hmm, or tried to.

888
00:48:43,363 --> 00:48:44,991
Who?
I don't know.

889
00:48:45,767 --> 00:48:49,466
We're gonna need more than my
psychic powers to figure this out.

890
00:48:54,914 --> 00:48:56,472
You here to scope out
the new meter maids?

891
00:48:56,473 --> 00:48:58,575
Nope, I'm here to see you.

892
00:48:58,576 --> 00:48:59,641
Not interested.

893
00:48:59,642 --> 00:49:01,382
I know, you have
someone special.

894
00:49:01,383 --> 00:49:03,152
<i>He's married andlor separated.</i>

895
00:49:03,153 --> 00:49:05,353
Is there a point to this,
Mr. Spencer?

896
00:49:05,354 --> 00:49:07,899
Of course. You and I have
something in common.

897
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,126
What's that?

898
00:49:09,127 --> 00:49:12,196
We both know this case
is nowhere near closed.

899
00:49:13,276 --> 00:49:17,510
Unfortunately, gut feelings aren't
admissible in a California court.

900
00:49:18,851 --> 00:49:20,044
How about motive?

901
00:49:20,045 --> 00:49:21,177
What do you have?

902
00:49:21,178 --> 00:49:24,122
Nothing yet.
But I've seen something.

903
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:26,629
Seen, or seen?

904
00:49:28,399 --> 00:49:30,425
Well, what do you think?

905
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:31,860
Okay, what do you need?

906
00:49:31,861 --> 00:49:33,803
Everything you have
on Malcolm Orso.

907
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,101
He was Camden's accomplice.

908
00:49:35,102 --> 00:49:36,608
I'll get fired.

909
00:49:36,609 --> 00:49:39,044
Will you really? Because it
seems like a gray area to me.

910
00:49:39,045 --> 00:49:40,639
That's the problem with you,
Mr. Spencer.

911
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,309
You live your entire life
in a gray area.

912
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:46,291
That's not true. Though I
generally vacation in gray areas.

913
00:49:51,401 --> 00:49:52,767
We can't talk here.

914
00:49:57,877 --> 00:49:59,708
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up.

915
00:49:59,709 --> 00:50:03,147
It says Orso was seen in the
town, near the cabin. Yeah.

916
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,485
Twice. Early in the week
by a store owner.

917
00:50:06,691 --> 00:50:07,750
What was he buying?

918
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,452
Nothing. The old man just
saw him on the street.

919
00:50:11,453 --> 00:50:13,432
The same old man sees him
two times?

920
00:50:13,433 --> 00:50:14,764
Yeah.

921
00:50:15,938 --> 00:50:18,236
Orso had one of those
modified mufflers on his Nova.

922
00:50:18,237 --> 00:50:20,334
You could hear him
a block away.

923
00:50:23,349 --> 00:50:25,317
You'll need
a new target sheet.

924
00:50:25,318 --> 00:50:28,721
Oh, no, no, this is...
This is fine.

925
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:31,850
Wow.

926
00:50:31,851 --> 00:50:35,333
They're so much lighter when
they're filled with water.

927
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:46,377
You missed.

928
00:50:46,378 --> 00:50:47,612
Did I really?

929
00:51:02,209 --> 00:51:03,939
Look at that.

930
00:51:04,579 --> 00:51:06,377
It's a perfect match.

931
00:51:06,716 --> 00:51:07,843
Damn!

932
00:51:12,258 --> 00:51:15,194
I'm telling you, there's no way
Katarina's gonna talk to you.

933
00:51:15,195 --> 00:51:17,993
Yeah, well, I sort of
lied about that part.

934
00:51:17,994 --> 00:51:19,761
We're not here
to see Katarina.

935
00:51:19,762 --> 00:51:21,804
Who are we here to see?

936
00:51:21,805 --> 00:51:24,433
This is highly
inappropriate, Mr. Spencer.

937
00:51:24,434 --> 00:51:26,408
The investigation is over.

938
00:51:26,409 --> 00:51:28,142
What if they got
the wrong man?

939
00:51:28,883 --> 00:51:30,511
And who would
the right man be?

940
00:51:31,086 --> 00:51:32,145
You.

941
00:51:45,843 --> 00:51:49,246
Mr. McCallum, I didn't have
anything to do with this.

942
00:51:49,882 --> 00:51:51,349
I killed my own son?

943
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:53,682
Makes you feel any better,
I don't think you meant to.

944
00:51:53,683 --> 00:51:56,588
You're not a detective.
You're not even a cop.

945
00:51:56,589 --> 00:51:58,628
You're right, I'm a psychic.

946
00:51:59,296 --> 00:52:00,924
And I saw the whole thing.

947
00:52:04,605 --> 00:52:06,436
I see a ransom drop.

948
00:52:06,437 --> 00:52:09,341
<i>You're doing everything
they ask, you didn't call the police,</i>

949
00:52:09,342 --> 00:52:12,177
<i>you're thinking of nothing
but the security of your son.</i>

950
00:52:12,618 --> 00:52:14,985
After all, what's
$5 million to you?

951
00:52:16,155 --> 00:52:17,952
You're driving away,
I can see it.

952
00:52:17,953 --> 00:52:21,963
<i>Something strange happens. You
recognize the car. You pass it on the hill.</i>

953
00:52:21,964 --> 00:52:23,795
<i>It's Malcolm Orso's.</i>

954
00:52:23,796 --> 00:52:27,634
<i>You've seen it hundreds of times
at your house, ever since high school.</i>

955
00:52:27,635 --> 00:52:30,835
Maybe it confirms the suspicion
that you already have.

956
00:52:30,836 --> 00:52:32,880
You know where they are.

957
00:52:32,881 --> 00:52:34,276
You know the cabin.

958
00:52:37,589 --> 00:52:39,057
He's making coffee.

959
00:52:45,067 --> 00:52:47,592
You didn't mean to kill him,
did you?

960
00:52:47,593 --> 00:52:51,301
No, just knock him around a
little bit, teach him a lesson.

961
00:52:51,302 --> 00:52:55,075
<i>But he falls to the floor, he
slams his head on the oak table.</i>

962
00:52:57,018 --> 00:53:01,788
He's dead.
You know he's dead.

963
00:53:07,168 --> 00:53:09,262
Orso walks in, finds you.

964
00:53:12,275 --> 00:53:15,542
<i>He's got a half-assed pistol,
but he's no criminal.</i>

965
00:53:30,636 --> 00:53:32,627
<i>You know there's only one way
to cover your tracks.</i>

966
00:53:32,628 --> 00:53:34,800
<i>You take care of him, too.</i>

967
00:53:45,526 --> 00:53:47,552
<i>Make it look like a suicide.</i>

968
00:53:50,634 --> 00:53:54,537
Then, you come home, inform
the police, and you wait.

969
00:53:54,538 --> 00:53:57,772
You wait for a ransom call
that will never come.

970
00:53:59,314 --> 00:54:00,645
Police eat it up.

971
00:54:01,184 --> 00:54:04,245
It's easy to look shaken
after all you've done.

972
00:54:04,655 --> 00:54:07,626
You might even be willing
to take your own life.

973
00:54:08,261 --> 00:54:10,595
You have an overactive
imagination.

974
00:54:11,232 --> 00:54:13,928
Perhaps a side-effect
of your gift.

975
00:54:13,929 --> 00:54:15,162
Shawn, we need to go.

976
00:54:15,163 --> 00:54:16,262
Not yet.

977
00:54:16,263 --> 00:54:18,103
I'm about to throw up
on a Turkish carpet.

978
00:54:18,104 --> 00:54:20,644
No, you're not.
It's in my esophagus.

979
00:54:20,645 --> 00:54:23,684
The second door on the left,
turn on the fan and flush.

980
00:54:26,579 --> 00:54:30,559
I will not have this incident
rehashed over and over again.

981
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,859
I know what your relationship
was with your son.

982
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:34,263
Oh, really?

983
00:54:34,264 --> 00:54:36,928
I have a father that I
disappoint all the time.

984
00:54:36,929 --> 00:54:38,598
I'm sure you do.

985
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:43,206
I know how you feel.
This was it.

986
00:54:43,207 --> 00:54:45,944
This was the straw that broke
the camel's back, wasn't it?

987
00:54:45,945 --> 00:54:48,954
To think, 18 months ago,
he sat across from you,

988
00:54:48,955 --> 00:54:50,513
looked you right in the eye
and said,

989
00:54:50,514 --> 00:54:52,959
"Dad, I'm gonna clean up
my act this time.

990
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,194
"This time, I'm gonna change,
I swear."

991
00:54:56,468 --> 00:55:00,371
To know that he duped you and
you fell for it all over again,

992
00:55:00,372 --> 00:55:03,640
must've sent you into a state
that even you can't believe.

993
00:55:07,819 --> 00:55:11,278
Mr. Spencer, I've been assured
by the Lieutenant Governor

994
00:55:11,279 --> 00:55:14,760
that this case will not cast
a pall over my family.

995
00:55:14,761 --> 00:55:18,199
But I can assure you, it's
gonna cast one over yours.

996
00:55:18,969 --> 00:55:21,565
My very first case, I'm
already being threatened. Wow!

997
00:55:23,009 --> 00:55:24,567
Shawn, let's go.

998
00:55:24,568 --> 00:55:25,703
I'm not quite finished.

999
00:55:25,704 --> 00:55:26,803
We're going, now.

1000
00:55:26,804 --> 00:55:28,747
Listen to your friend.

1001
00:55:31,222 --> 00:55:33,384
I'll be back.
No, you won't.

1002
00:55:39,134 --> 00:55:42,071
Okay, we're going. We're
clearly going. All right!

1003
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,867
Dude, what are you doing?
We had him on the ropes.

1004
00:55:44,868 --> 00:55:46,240
It wasn't the right tack.

1005
00:55:46,241 --> 00:55:48,212
Oh, you're the expert now?
Consumine.

1006
00:55:48,213 --> 00:55:49,372
What?
Consumine.

1007
00:55:49,373 --> 00:55:51,076
It's for dog bites.
I have some samples.

1008
00:55:51,077 --> 00:55:52,585
Gus, what are you
saying to me?

1009
00:55:52,586 --> 00:55:55,283
I'm saying there was a bottle
of it in the medicine cabinet,

1010
00:55:55,284 --> 00:55:56,848
prescribed Wednesday.

1011
00:55:56,849 --> 00:56:01,025
You wonder why he had on that long-sleeved
shirt in the heat that first day?

1012
00:56:01,026 --> 00:56:03,399
Oh, my gosh! That dog did
have blood on its teeth.

1013
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,531
I told you
it wasn't Snausages.

1014
00:56:10,182 --> 00:56:12,811
We're never getting
back in there. I know.

1015
00:56:13,821 --> 00:56:15,687
Just give me a second.

1016
00:56:18,261 --> 00:56:19,489
What are you doing?
I'm thinking.

1017
00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:21,087
You look ridiculous.

1018
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:26,235
Now what are you doing?
Calling the cops.

1019
00:56:26,236 --> 00:56:27,364
For what?

1020
00:56:27,365 --> 00:56:29,636
You heard the guy in there.
They're never gonna come.

1021
00:56:29,637 --> 00:56:32,009
I'm not calling the cops on
him, I'm calling the cops on us.

1022
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:34,140
Gus, we need this to play out
in front of an audience,

1023
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:36,744
<i>- with all the major players in place.
- Santa Barbara Police Department.</i>

1024
00:56:36,745 --> 00:56:39,484
Yes, hello. I'm
calling from the McCallum residence.

1025
00:56:39,485 --> 00:56:41,288
There's an intruder here.
He simply won't leave.

1026
00:56:41,289 --> 00:56:43,489
He's claiming to be a psychic
that works for your department.

1027
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:44,623
<i>Pardon me?</i>

1028
00:56:44,624 --> 00:56:46,225
Mr. McCallum is enraged

1029
00:56:46,226 --> 00:56:48,636
and he wants this handled by
the highest authority possible.

1030
00:56:48,637 --> 00:56:51,142
Please send the Chief
immediately.

1031
00:56:57,254 --> 00:56:58,813
Did you really vomit?

1032
00:57:04,197 --> 00:57:05,494
Who called them?

1033
00:57:05,495 --> 00:57:08,264
I don't know, sir,
maybe the back staff.

1034
00:57:09,105 --> 00:57:10,697
Those two gentlemen
have not left the driveway.

1035
00:57:10,698 --> 00:57:12,469
Would you like me to
send them all away?

1036
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:15,640
No, let's finish this.

1037
00:57:17,518 --> 00:57:20,715
As you can see, Karen,
this simply cannot happen.

1038
00:57:20,716 --> 00:57:22,916
It'll be taken care of,
believe me.

1039
00:57:22,917 --> 00:57:25,086
He was given clear
instructions to stay away.

1040
00:57:25,087 --> 00:57:26,561
I understand, but...

1041
00:57:26,562 --> 00:57:29,658
Yeah, it's times like this I
remember why I love my job so much.

1042
00:57:29,659 --> 00:57:30,761
Anytime, Shawn.

1043
00:57:30,762 --> 00:57:32,830
He's getting cocky,
give it a sec.

1044
00:57:32,831 --> 00:57:34,569
We're gonna be at
city jail in a sec.

1045
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:36,875
Uh-huh. Here we are.

1046
00:57:37,849 --> 00:57:40,217
Oh, I'm
sorry. Did that hurt?

1047
00:57:41,956 --> 00:57:43,618
Something's happening!

1048
00:57:44,826 --> 00:57:46,487
Gus, something's happening!

1049
00:57:46,488 --> 00:57:47,791
Stop it.

1050
00:57:49,891 --> 00:57:51,231
Wait.

1051
00:57:54,408 --> 00:57:55,671
The dog!
Shut up.

1052
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:57,902
He's biting the intruder!

1053
00:57:59,716 --> 00:58:00,705
He knows him.

1054
00:58:00,706 --> 00:58:02,650
It's someone he knows!
The dog knows him!

1055
00:58:02,651 --> 00:58:04,313
Stop talking!
Ouch!

1056
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,381
The teeth are digging in!

1057
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:08,452
Shut up!
Now there's blood!

1058
00:58:10,758 --> 00:58:12,733
It's him, it's McCallum!

1059
00:58:12,734 --> 00:58:15,705
I can see his face!
The killer is McCallum!

1060
00:58:15,706 --> 00:58:16,762
Check his wrist!

1061
00:58:16,763 --> 00:58:19,141
Check his right wrist!
The teeth marks will match up!

1062
00:58:19,142 --> 00:58:20,270
Get him out of here!

1063
00:58:20,271 --> 00:58:21,609
Check the wrist!

1064
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:23,743
No one is checking
any part of me!

1065
00:58:24,855 --> 00:58:25,946
Why not?

1066
00:58:25,947 --> 00:58:27,150
Huh?

1067
00:58:28,461 --> 00:58:31,522
We could close this out immediately,
discredit him right here.

1068
00:58:33,167 --> 00:58:35,260
That's an awful wound
you have bandaged there.

1069
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:38,536
This is outrageous! Do you
really want to do this?

1070
00:58:38,909 --> 00:58:42,402
I could do this now, or I
could call in a warrant.

1071
00:58:42,403 --> 00:58:43,780
I'll call my lawyer.

1072
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:47,145
I'll be right here.

1073
00:58:48,257 --> 00:58:49,485
I see a doctor!

1074
00:58:49,486 --> 00:58:51,618
I'm seeing a doctor,
Dr. Mandali,

1075
00:58:51,619 --> 00:58:55,724
and a word, "Consumine!"
Yeah, it's for dog bites!

1076
00:58:55,725 --> 00:58:58,773
The wound is fresh!
Check the wound!

1077
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:02,111
It's a fresh wound,
it's still a fresh wound!

1078
00:59:07,453 --> 00:59:10,356
It was
an accident, I didn't...

1079
00:59:11,392 --> 00:59:12,485
What?

1080
00:59:16,901 --> 00:59:18,267
Sergeant.

1081
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,541
This way, sir.

1082
00:59:25,247 --> 00:59:28,081
You wanna take these cuffs
off of me, please?

1083
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:30,652
Thank you.

1084
00:59:35,629 --> 00:59:37,758
Seriously, how?

1085
00:59:40,704 --> 00:59:42,138
I wish I knew.

1086
00:59:50,152 --> 00:59:53,612
Do you think this pretty much
ruins my chances with Katarina?

1087
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:09,305
There she is!

1088
01:00:09,306 --> 01:00:11,782
Don't ever walk into my
office without knocking.

1089
01:00:11,783 --> 01:00:13,479
I'm sorry, I got excited.

1090
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,079
You know what I'll
do to you? Yes.

1091
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,852
You do?
I'm a psychic.

1092
01:00:18,128 --> 01:00:20,289
I am just finishing up in here,
I'll be with you in a moment.

1093
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:22,596
That's all right, Karen.
I've got to get going anyway.

1094
01:00:22,597 --> 01:00:23,828
Thank you very much
for coming down.

1095
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:26,099
Yeah. Okay.
You've been a big help.

1096
01:00:27,275 --> 01:00:28,868
Son.
Dad.

1097
01:00:32,217 --> 01:00:33,514
Have a seat.

1098
01:00:36,123 --> 01:00:38,819
I was considering adding you
to my speed dial, Mr. Spencer,

1099
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:41,191
but I would be remiss if I didn't
do a little background check,

1100
01:00:41,192 --> 01:00:42,389
don't you think?

1101
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:43,391
Yes.

1102
01:00:45,504 --> 01:00:47,472
I asked your dad how long
you've had the gift.

1103
01:00:47,473 --> 01:00:50,373
Look, my father's memory
is pretty cloudy.

1104
01:00:50,374 --> 01:00:52,036
It certainly is.

1105
01:00:52,037 --> 01:00:55,015
His recollection doesn't match
up with your assertion at all.

1106
01:00:55,016 --> 01:00:56,142
I can explain that.

1107
01:00:56,143 --> 01:00:58,984
You said you've had this
ability your whole life.

1108
01:00:58,985 --> 01:01:02,460
Well, whole life... I mean,
it's a bit of a gray area.

1109
01:01:02,461 --> 01:01:05,022
He said you didn't get it
until you were 18.

1110
01:01:06,169 --> 01:01:07,967
He said that?
Mmm-hmm.

1111
01:01:10,008 --> 01:01:13,138
Wow, that is just like him.

1112
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:16,909
The man simply refuses to
acknowledge my abilities, my gifts.

1113
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,386
Can we discuss my fee?

1114
01:01:22,326 --> 01:01:24,124
There's a check in the cage.

1115
01:01:25,131 --> 01:01:27,623
Sign for it,
and then come back in.

1116
01:01:28,002 --> 01:01:30,470
Come... Come back in here?
Mmm-hmm.

1117
01:01:30,471 --> 01:01:31,597
Why?

1118
01:01:32,542 --> 01:01:35,011
You familiar with
a chop shop in Summerland?

1119
01:01:38,785 --> 01:01:39,878
Dad!

1120
01:01:42,491 --> 01:01:45,290
So, are you gonna continue
with this little charade?

1121
01:01:45,291 --> 01:01:48,560
Well, it sort of gives me
carte blanche, you know?

1122
01:01:48,561 --> 01:01:52,092
I mean, I can work cases for the
department, I can do private jobs.

1123
01:01:52,093 --> 01:01:54,802
In fact, I've already
got another case.

1124
01:01:55,177 --> 01:01:56,475
Be aware.

1125
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,376
This is the last time
I cover for you, pal.

1126
01:02:02,822 --> 01:02:05,725
I'm not okay with this,
Shawn, any of it.

1127
01:02:14,306 --> 01:02:16,275
I don't expect you to be, Dad.

1128
01:02:43,852 --> 01:02:45,081
Awesome!

1129
01:02:51,964 --> 01:02:53,091
Psych?

1130
01:02:53,933 --> 01:02:55,195
As in gotcha.

1131
01:02:55,196 --> 01:02:58,263
Or as in psychic.

1132
01:03:00,644 --> 01:03:03,581
You named your fake
detective agency Psych?

1133
01:03:04,183 --> 01:03:05,343
Why don't you just call it,

1134
01:03:05,344 --> 01:03:07,579
"Hey, we're fooling you
and the police department.

1135
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:10,055
"Hope we don't make a mistake
and somebody dies because of it."

1136
01:03:10,056 --> 01:03:11,888
First of all, Gus, that
name is entirely too long,

1137
01:03:11,889 --> 01:03:13,394
it would never fit
on the window.

1138
01:03:13,395 --> 01:03:16,399
And, secondly, the best way to convince
people you're not lying to them,

1139
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,404
is to tell them you are!

1140
01:03:18,805 --> 01:03:21,798
Whatever, Shawn.
It's your agency, go for it.

1141
01:03:22,244 --> 01:03:25,476
Actually, it's our agency.

1142
01:03:27,953 --> 01:03:29,442
I put your name
on the lease as well.

1143
01:03:29,443 --> 01:03:31,352
Tell me, does that look
anything like your signature?

1144
01:03:31,353 --> 01:03:32,482
I gave it a shot.

1145
01:03:32,483 --> 01:03:33,821
This better be a joke.

1146
01:03:33,822 --> 01:03:36,227
Don't worry, you won't
have to do a thing.

1147
01:03:36,228 --> 01:03:38,324
I've worked out
every last detail.

1148
01:03:38,325 --> 01:03:40,427
What's your dental plan?
Don't get cavities.

1149
01:03:40,428 --> 01:03:42,974
Health plan? Same, but
with hepatitis and shingles.

1150
01:03:42,975 --> 01:03:44,567
So, I'm supposed
to quit my job,

1151
01:03:44,568 --> 01:03:46,476
skip over and do this
for no guaranteed money.

1152
01:03:46,477 --> 01:03:49,278
No guaranteed money,
but all guaranteed fun.

1153
01:03:49,279 --> 01:03:52,653
No. No more cases, Shawn.
It was fun for a few days.

1154
01:03:55,528 --> 01:03:57,519
Well, it's gonna have to be fun
for a minimum of six months,

1155
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:58,962
or we'll have to pay
a lease penalty,

1156
01:03:58,963 --> 01:04:02,868
which would be a blemish on your
otherwise very impressive credit report.

1157
01:04:02,869 --> 01:04:06,205
You solved one mystery, and now
you're renting office space?

1158
01:04:06,206 --> 01:04:09,180
Gus, I've solved
a bunch of mysteries.

1159
01:04:09,181 --> 01:04:12,047
For instance, the mystery of who
kept stealing your newspaper.

1160
01:04:12,048 --> 01:04:13,610
Answer: Me!

1161
01:04:13,611 --> 01:04:17,148
The mystery of what we're doing this
weekend. Hint, it involves dragsters.

1162
01:04:17,149 --> 01:04:20,562
And finally, the mystery
that is the case

1163
01:04:20,563 --> 01:04:22,966
the Chief just
brought me in on.

1164
01:04:24,606 --> 01:04:25,937
You got another case already?

1165
01:04:25,938 --> 01:04:27,806
A car thief got poisoned
by his boss.

1166
01:04:27,807 --> 01:04:31,576
He used something over
the counter. Fizadine.

1167
01:04:31,577 --> 01:04:34,176
No, Fizaderbal. No...

1168
01:04:35,590 --> 01:04:37,023
Fizadrine?
That's it!

1169
01:04:37,024 --> 01:04:39,652
Wow. How'd he do that?

1170
01:04:39,653 --> 01:04:41,561
I'll tell you on the way.

1171
01:04:43,668 --> 01:04:45,796
Just for today, right?
Absolutely.

1172
01:04:54,152 --> 01:04:57,589
<i>I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth</i>

1182

1184
