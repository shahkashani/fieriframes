1
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:10,908
Dude, do you know they
make silent window shades?

2
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,646
Some woman in Washington
invented them

3
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:14,806
back in the early '90s.

4
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:17,042
Since when is the sound of
opening and closing shades

5
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:18,709
so disruptive that it
has to be alleviated?

6
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:21,413
Why do you have to hate on other
peoples triumphs of innovation?

7
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:23,149
Weird.
It's not weird, it's selfish

8
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:24,212
and more than a little petty.

9
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:25,815
No, not that,
come take a look at this.

10
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:28,694
Man, this better not
be another auction

11
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,593
for one of Stoney
Jackson's neckerchiefs.

12
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:31,790
It's not, Shawn.

13
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,355
This came in
on the Psych account.

14
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:35,230
The sender is
"me-at-under-the-nail- dot-com."

15
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:37,603
I'm pretty sure
it's not spam.

16
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:39,302
Well, what's the attachment?

17
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,100
Cinnamon festival.

18
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:42,198
<i>The Great Northern.</i>

19
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:43,799
I'm not familiar
with that publication.

20
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,777
What, you know every small
town newspaper in California?

21
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,108
Actually, I do, Shawn.

22
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,477
<i>Ridgecrest?
The Daily Independent.</i>

23
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,776
Shawnopolis.
That doesn't exist.

24
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,908
Yet.

25
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:53,248
I just need 50,000 signatures
and a large plot of land.

26
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:56,313
Well, look up this town,
Dual Spires.

27
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,085
I mean, how can there be a cinnamon
festival that we've never heard of?

28
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,487
Zoom in.

29
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:02,494
Zoom in again.

30
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:05,021
Keep zooming.
I am, Shawn.

31
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:09,435
Dude, this town is so small
that it's in parenthesis.

32
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,961
How the heck
did we get this email?

33
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:13,335
It's a delicious mystery.

34
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,405
Think about it,
a tiny little town

35
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:17,067
we've never even heard of?

36
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:18,475
What's your schedule
look like?

37
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:19,705
I'm open till
my route tomorrow.

38
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,940
Let's see here.

39
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:22,072
You think they'll
have monkey bread?

40
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:23,411
Yes, I do.
What?

41
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,912
<i>I'm good till
next WrestleMania.</i>

42
00:01:40,113 --> 00:01:42,047
Half a mile
from the nearest road.

43
00:01:42,115 --> 00:01:43,582
No wonder it's
in parenthesis.

44
00:01:46,786 --> 00:01:48,447
This is one
secluded town.

45
00:01:54,427 --> 00:01:56,395
Let's get
some cinnamon.

46
00:01:59,632 --> 00:02:00,792
Wow. Everyone
looks so happy,

47
00:02:01,267 --> 00:02:03,394
and yet, so perplexed.

48
00:02:04,526 --> 00:02:06,357
Something's off
about this place, Shawn.

49
00:02:06,428 --> 00:02:07,417
People keep looking,

50
00:02:07,496 --> 00:02:08,827
like I'm the first
black man they've seen.

51
00:02:08,897 --> 00:02:11,297
Come on, Gus.
Don't be absurd.

52
00:02:12,434 --> 00:02:15,665
Hey mister, are you
Frederick Douglass?

53
00:02:16,738 --> 00:02:18,296
Shawn, we need
to get out of here.

54
00:02:21,076 --> 00:02:22,907
Nah, let's get
something to eat.

55
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:37,322
Hey, top of the morning
to you, boys.

56
00:02:37,526 --> 00:02:39,221
Robert Barker.
You can call me Bob.

57
00:02:39,561 --> 00:02:40,960
Just passing through?

58
00:02:41,029 --> 00:02:42,087
We're here
for the festival.

59
00:02:42,164 --> 00:02:44,064
We take our cinnamon
very seriously.

60
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:46,358
Well, then you're in luck,
because so do we.

61
00:02:46,435 --> 00:02:47,424
Ninety years running.

62
00:02:47,803 --> 00:02:49,395
Why do you call
your diner The Sawmill?

63
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:50,768
'Cause that's
what it used to be.

64
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:52,704
Most of it burned down
back in '58.

65
00:02:53,141 --> 00:02:54,438
Granddad turned it
into this place,

66
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,239
and now it's just a bit
of a local landmark.

67
00:02:57,112 --> 00:02:58,101
We just need
a little something

68
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,579
to hold us over
until show time,

69
00:02:59,648 --> 00:03:01,206
so, uh, what's good?

70
00:03:01,283 --> 00:03:02,648
How about a cup

71
00:03:02,718 --> 00:03:04,845
of the best
pipin' hot apple cider

72
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,909
this side of
the Mississippi

73
00:03:05,988 --> 00:03:09,924
and a slice of cinnamon pie
that may just bring tears?

74
00:03:12,227 --> 00:03:13,558
Two slices
of cinnamon pie, hon.

75
00:03:15,197 --> 00:03:17,427
That's the wife.
Isn't she a peach?

76
00:03:17,866 --> 00:03:19,834
Ah, I'll get that cider.

77
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:21,831
Bob's a real Chatty Cathy.
You think?

78
00:03:21,904 --> 00:03:23,235
You should check your email.

79
00:03:23,305 --> 00:03:25,466
See if our secret pal
sent us any cinnamon comps.

80
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,771
I'm afraid you won't have much
luck with those here.

81
00:03:29,478 --> 00:03:30,706
Sheriff Andrew Jackson.

82
00:03:31,547 --> 00:03:33,037
You know,
we had the opportunity

83
00:03:33,115 --> 00:03:35,413
to put up some of
those fancy towers,

84
00:03:36,218 --> 00:03:39,210
but folks decided a basic
landline was fine with them.

85
00:03:39,755 --> 00:03:41,279
I couldn't help
but overhear

86
00:03:41,356 --> 00:03:44,291
that you're in town
for the festival.

87
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:46,190
It's rare to get visitors.

88
00:03:46,261 --> 00:03:50,789
Well, we heard all about
it on underthenail. com.

89
00:03:52,634 --> 00:03:55,501
We don't have the
Internet in Dual Spires.

90
00:03:56,371 --> 00:03:57,463
It's simpler that way.

91
00:03:58,507 --> 00:04:00,475
<i>Dude, we're doing Witness.
They were Amish.</i>

92
00:04:00,542 --> 00:04:01,736
Not Danny Glover,
he was black.

93
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,402
What are you
talking about?

94
00:04:03,478 --> 00:04:06,038
Well, we are happy
you're here, nevertheless.

95
00:04:06,782 --> 00:04:08,750
It should be a heck
of a celebration.

96
00:04:09,117 --> 00:04:10,482
Two slices of cinnamon pie.

97
00:04:10,552 --> 00:04:11,849
Oh, thank you.

98
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:18,256
Well, we'll see you
at the festival.

99
00:04:18,327 --> 00:04:19,555
Sheriff.

100
00:04:24,433 --> 00:04:26,162
What's the verdict?

101
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:27,862
Really?

102
00:04:28,604 --> 00:04:29,662
Mmm.

103
00:04:30,305 --> 00:04:31,363
Oh, mother of God.

104
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,930
Mmm.
Mmm.

105
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:34,264
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm.

106
00:04:39,381 --> 00:04:41,975
Dude, that owl is made
entirely of cinnamon.

107
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,541
Which means that it is
both wise and delicious.

108
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,350
<i>Let's have a nice,
warm round of applause</i>

109
00:04:47,422 --> 00:04:49,287
<i>for Mayor Douglas Fir.</i>

110
00:04:52,694 --> 00:04:56,460
<i>And, this year's
festival mascot,</i>

111
00:04:56,531 --> 00:04:59,091
<i>Leo, the cinnamon owl.</i>

112
00:05:00,302 --> 00:05:02,532
You found the monkey bread.
You know that's right.

113
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:05,535
<i>And now, the moment I know
you've all been waiting for.</i>

114
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:09,067
<i>It's time to announce this
year's Cinnamon King.</i>

115
00:05:10,078 --> 00:05:11,568
<i>Who-oo will it be?</i>

116
00:05:11,913 --> 00:05:13,608
Who, who, who?

117
00:05:14,549 --> 00:05:15,777
<i>Oh, who are we kidding?</i>

118
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:17,113
<i>Put your hands together</i>

119
00:05:17,185 --> 00:05:19,415
<i>for the future leader
of Dual Spires.</i>

120
00:05:19,488 --> 00:05:21,888
<i>A young man that
needs no introduction,</i>

121
00:05:21,957 --> 00:05:23,925
<i>come up and
claim your crown, Randy.</i>

122
00:05:34,269 --> 00:05:35,293
That's my boy.

123
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,270
What's 24 times 12?

124
00:05:37,539 --> 00:05:38,767
Two-eighty-eight.
Why?

125
00:05:42,744 --> 00:05:44,609
There's a chair here
for every person in town.

126
00:05:45,213 --> 00:05:47,647
Three are empty.
Sheriff's talking, so that's one.

127
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,139
Check it out.

128
00:05:49,217 --> 00:05:51,082
There's one
right next to the Barkers.

129
00:05:58,694 --> 00:06:00,787
Hey. Hey, you found
the monkey bread.

130
00:06:00,862 --> 00:06:01,954
Yeah.

131
00:06:02,964 --> 00:06:04,591
Mrs. Barker,
is everything okay?

132
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:07,433
No.
Everything is not okay.

133
00:06:08,303 --> 00:06:09,668
Shelley.
What?

134
00:06:09,938 --> 00:06:12,566
I can't just sit here
and pretend to be excited

135
00:06:12,641 --> 00:06:15,701
about churros and
Leo the cinnamon owl.

136
00:06:16,378 --> 00:06:18,642
I sense someone is missing.

137
00:06:19,247 --> 00:06:21,147
Yeah.
Our niece, Paula.

138
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:23,783
She's been gone
about a day and a half.

139
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:26,110
Everyone keeps
telling us not to panic.

140
00:06:26,521 --> 00:06:27,613
She's a teenager.

141
00:06:27,756 --> 00:06:30,987
Wait, what did you mean,
you sensed it?

142
00:06:31,226 --> 00:06:33,558
Mr. and Mrs. Barker,
I have a confession to make.

143
00:06:33,628 --> 00:06:35,528
I'm not just
a cinnamon enthusiast.

144
00:06:35,864 --> 00:06:37,456
I'm also a
psychic detective.

145
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,862
And this is my partner,
Lodge Blackmunn.

146
00:06:41,403 --> 00:06:43,064
Can you find Paula?

147
00:06:43,138 --> 00:06:44,537
Perhaps.
Oh!

148
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,604
I got a little something
under the nail.

149
00:06:49,144 --> 00:06:51,169
Right here, under...
Under the nail.

150
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:55,077
We are available for hire.

151
00:06:55,417 --> 00:06:57,044
We don't have
much money.

152
00:06:57,119 --> 00:06:58,279
None of us do, here.

153
00:06:58,353 --> 00:07:00,116
We believe
it complicates things.

154
00:07:00,455 --> 00:07:03,253
Well, we have been known to work
for cider or pie in the past.

155
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,718
Oh, of course.
As much as you'd like.

156
00:07:06,428 --> 00:07:07,452
We will find your niece.

157
00:07:07,863 --> 00:07:09,228
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

158
00:07:10,031 --> 00:07:11,965
Who is supposed to be
sitting over there?

159
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:15,661
Oh, that's Paula's
best friend, Jack.

160
00:07:16,404 --> 00:07:18,304
I'm not sure where he is.

161
00:07:20,609 --> 00:07:21,598
Would this be...

162
00:07:25,247 --> 00:07:26,509
Something happened
at the lake.

163
00:07:26,782 --> 00:07:28,807
Something happened
at the lake!

164
00:07:32,988 --> 00:07:34,182
It's Paula.

165
00:07:34,256 --> 00:07:35,723
I know it is.

166
00:07:56,478 --> 00:07:59,413
Jack just discovered
her, about an hour ago, Doc.

167
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:02,511
So young.

168
00:08:04,452 --> 00:08:05,976
My God, Andrew.

169
00:08:16,932 --> 00:08:18,399
Jack, is this
how you found her?

170
00:08:18,767 --> 00:08:20,792
No, sir.
She was half naked.

171
00:08:21,837 --> 00:08:24,738
It wasn't right.
I didn't want people to see her like that.

172
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,571
I'm sorry.

173
00:08:29,678 --> 00:08:32,306
Oh, now I've got to let
the Barkers through.

174
00:08:36,952 --> 00:08:39,352
No!

175
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,987
No, my baby.

176
00:08:48,763 --> 00:08:49,923
Paula.

177
00:08:51,867 --> 00:08:52,959
Paula!

178
00:08:56,238 --> 00:08:57,227
Paula.

179
00:09:09,176 --> 00:09:10,973
Come on, dude.

180
00:09:11,045 --> 00:09:12,945
You know I'm a sympathetic
crier, Shawn.

181
00:09:13,013 --> 00:09:14,640
Just leave me be.

182
00:09:17,084 --> 00:09:18,915
Dude, I have a bar.

183
00:09:20,654 --> 00:09:21,712
And an email.

184
00:09:24,258 --> 00:09:27,159
Gus, we weren't called here
for a cinnamon festival.

185
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:45,145
<i>In between the lines
there's a lot of obscurity</i>

186
00:09:45,913 --> 00:09:51,545
<i>I'm not inclined
to resign to maturity</i>

187
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:58,288
<i>If it's all right
then you're all wrong</i>

188
00:09:58,359 --> 00:10:05,288
<i>But why bounce around
to the same damn song?</i>

189
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:12,295
<i>You'd rather run
when you can't crawl</i>

190
00:10:18,446 --> 00:10:21,643
<i>I know, you know</i>

191
00:10:24,752 --> 00:10:28,848
<i>I know, you know</i>

192
00:10:36,311 --> 00:10:37,972
I'm guessing
the time of death was

193
00:10:38,046 --> 00:10:40,173
sometime night
before last.

194
00:10:40,248 --> 00:10:42,443
Doc Gooden will do
a full autopsy.

195
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:43,950
You know she won't
miss a thing, Bob.

196
00:10:44,752 --> 00:10:47,243
But I suspect
what we will find

197
00:10:47,322 --> 00:10:49,620
is that Paula went
swimming after curfew,

198
00:10:50,091 --> 00:10:51,251
like she always did,

199
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:53,256
and got pulled under
by the current

200
00:10:53,428 --> 00:10:54,588
and hit her head.

201
00:10:54,996 --> 00:10:57,055
I'm gonna rule it
an accident for now.

202
00:10:57,131 --> 00:10:59,156
She must have snuck out.

203
00:11:00,502 --> 00:11:03,562
Bob, we both know
she's been sneaking out

204
00:11:03,638 --> 00:11:06,163
just about every night
since she got here.

205
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:09,301
Listen, why don't you
take Michelle on home.

206
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,107
She's gonna need you
to be strong now.

207
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,374
I'll get Deputy Frost to
take you back in the rickshaw.

208
00:11:16,584 --> 00:11:18,051
I'm so, so sorry, Bob.

209
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:27,594
Looks like we won't be needing
your services after all, boys.

210
00:11:27,662 --> 00:11:28,754
Mr. Barker, I am sensing

211
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,695
there is more to Paula's
death than meets the eye.

212
00:11:31,099 --> 00:11:32,532
What are you saying?

213
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,965
That she...

214
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,058
Oh, my God.

215
00:11:36,137 --> 00:11:38,697
We'd like to stick around.
See what we see.

216
00:11:38,773 --> 00:11:40,331
Feel what we feel.

217
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,500
Okay.

218
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,634
If someone hurt Paula,

219
00:11:43,711 --> 00:11:44,905
we sure as hell
want to know about it.

220
00:11:44,979 --> 00:11:47,607
I'm also sensing that Paula didn't
grow up here in Dual Spires.

221
00:11:47,682 --> 00:11:49,547
May I ask where
she was before?

222
00:11:49,617 --> 00:11:51,847
Paula lived in Santa
Barbara till she was 11.

223
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,485
Well, you have
our condolences,

224
00:11:53,555 --> 00:11:54,579
and we will be in touch.

225
00:11:57,992 --> 00:11:59,254
I think your ride
is here.

226
00:12:06,034 --> 00:12:08,195
The earth is soft and moist.

227
00:12:20,181 --> 00:12:21,205
That is so bizarre.

228
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:24,410
It's like I only have
reception in this spot.

229
00:12:36,264 --> 00:12:37,526
In all my years
of police work,

230
00:12:37,599 --> 00:12:39,032
I've never seen
anything like it.

231
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,089
I know.

232
00:12:40,168 --> 00:12:43,194
Our new station manager
is an angel sent from heaven.

233
00:12:46,874 --> 00:12:48,808
O'Hara.
Yes, Detective O'Hara.

234
00:12:48,876 --> 00:12:49,900
Shawn Spencer calling.

235
00:12:50,044 --> 00:12:52,478
Did you just use both of our last names?
Don't be weird.

236
00:12:52,547 --> 00:12:54,606
Okay, Miss O'Hara.

237
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:56,416
<i>Detective.
Shawn.</i>

238
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,510
Look, I'm really struggling with
the whole work formal thing.

239
00:12:59,587 --> 00:13:00,645
What are you wearing?

240
00:13:00,722 --> 00:13:02,849
Okay, you just took it from one
awkward extreme to another.

241
00:13:02,924 --> 00:13:04,721
I need you to run
a name for a girl.

242
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:05,816
Used to live
in Santa Barbara.

243
00:13:05,893 --> 00:13:07,383
Paula Merral.
Two "r"s.

244
00:13:07,462 --> 00:13:08,759
Sure, is everything okay?

245
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,127
Yeah, absolutely.

246
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:11,290
I'm gonna have to
call you back, though,

247
00:13:11,366 --> 00:13:13,129
'cause there's not really
reception up here.

248
00:13:13,201 --> 00:13:14,463
<i>Up where?</i>

249
00:13:14,802 --> 00:13:15,962
Hello?

250
00:13:16,137 --> 00:13:17,297
Jules.

251
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,665
Shawn?

252
00:13:19,073 --> 00:13:21,633
Wow, it really is
just the one spot.

253
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:22,835
Your conversations with Juliet

254
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,605
are too uncomfortable
to listen to now.

255
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,010
I'm calling next time.
Fine.

256
00:13:26,381 --> 00:13:28,611
Look, if we're going to
accomplish anything in this town,

257
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:29,843
we are gonna
need wheels.

258
00:13:33,421 --> 00:13:36,254
Shawn, we have reached
a new low point in our life.

259
00:13:36,324 --> 00:13:38,087
<i>Are you kidding me?
It's like Driving Miss Daisy.</i>

260
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,786
Except you
get to be Miss Daisy.

261
00:13:39,804 --> 00:13:42,238
I don't wanna be
in the movie, Shawn.

262
00:13:43,608 --> 00:13:46,099
Looks like the doctor
stays pretty busy.

263
00:13:48,846 --> 00:13:51,815
Guess you're out of luck
if you need a massage.

264
00:13:54,852 --> 00:13:57,320
Good job saving
your receipts, Patrick.

265
00:14:00,058 --> 00:14:01,548
May I help you, gentlemen?

266
00:14:01,626 --> 00:14:03,093
Hello, Doc Gooden.

267
00:14:03,161 --> 00:14:04,492
My partner,
plus too much

268
00:14:04,562 --> 00:14:06,553
cinnamon monkey bread
equals tummy shame.

269
00:14:06,631 --> 00:14:08,121
Can you help us?

270
00:14:08,232 --> 00:14:10,097
I'll see him
after my next patient.

271
00:14:16,107 --> 00:14:17,938
Doc, this could
get ugly fast.

272
00:14:18,976 --> 00:14:20,034
All right.

273
00:14:31,422 --> 00:14:32,719
Sheriff Jackson
mentioned we had

274
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,054
a couple of visitors
in town today.

275
00:14:35,126 --> 00:14:38,254
You are aware the cinnamon
festival has been cancelled.

276
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:39,796
Oh, yes.

277
00:14:39,864 --> 00:14:42,332
We heard there was
some sort of tragedy.

278
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,196
Must be so difficult

279
00:14:44,268 --> 00:14:47,260
in a small, happy town
like Dual Spires.

280
00:14:48,206 --> 00:14:50,436
Put this on and then lay
face down on my table.

281
00:14:50,675 --> 00:14:53,041
Uh, well you know...
Ah, ahh!

282
00:14:53,344 --> 00:14:54,368
Actually, I think...

283
00:14:54,445 --> 00:14:55,434
Snap to it.

284
00:14:56,247 --> 00:14:57,680
I'm not putting this on.

285
00:14:59,984 --> 00:15:00,973
Fine.

286
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,150
So how well did you
know the girl?

287
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:08,815
I'm sorry, I don't
know why I do that.

288
00:15:08,893 --> 00:15:11,953
I can just sense that
you have a heavy heart.

289
00:15:13,197 --> 00:15:15,028
I'm a woman of science.

290
00:15:15,099 --> 00:15:16,157
And law.

291
00:15:16,234 --> 00:15:17,223
And accounting.

292
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:19,564
But that doesn't mean
that I don't feel.

293
00:15:21,005 --> 00:15:23,166
Paula was
a troubled young girl.

294
00:15:23,407 --> 00:15:25,841
I wish I could have
done more to help her.

295
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,002
You were her
psychiatrist?

296
00:15:28,346 --> 00:15:29,836
You ask a lot of questions.

297
00:15:29,914 --> 00:15:32,474
It's just... I recently
lost someone myself.

298
00:15:33,451 --> 00:15:35,419
He was murdered too,
so I know how difficult...

299
00:15:35,485 --> 00:15:37,612
Paula wasn't murdered.
Who told you that?

300
00:15:37,755 --> 00:15:39,120
Oh, no one.

301
00:15:39,524 --> 00:15:41,014
I just assumed, because...

302
00:15:43,327 --> 00:15:45,557
I haven't done
an autopsy yet.

303
00:15:52,937 --> 00:15:55,235
There are no obvious signs
of foul play.

304
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,002
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to...

305
00:15:59,577 --> 00:16:02,102
No, it's not you.

306
00:16:02,446 --> 00:16:04,573
Like I said, she was
a troubled young girl.

307
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:06,082
She had a dangerous side.

308
00:16:07,518 --> 00:16:09,110
Nothing scared her.

309
00:16:09,187 --> 00:16:10,279
Not even dying.

310
00:16:10,988 --> 00:16:12,455
You think she
may have taken her own...

311
00:16:12,523 --> 00:16:15,014
No, I can't bear
that thought.

312
00:16:15,226 --> 00:16:17,387
I've said too
much to a stranger.

313
00:16:17,528 --> 00:16:19,018
I should be ashamed.

314
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:21,224
For caring?

315
00:16:23,334 --> 00:16:24,596
No, you shouldn't.

316
00:16:27,474 --> 00:16:29,772
You know, I actually
feel better.

317
00:16:29,943 --> 00:16:31,706
The myna bird
can come in now.

318
00:16:33,406 --> 00:16:34,498
What's up next?

319
00:16:34,574 --> 00:16:36,064
We need to find
our cinnamon king.

320
00:16:36,142 --> 00:16:37,234
That kid
has a secret.

321
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,709
What did
grandma tell you

322
00:16:38,778 --> 00:16:40,507
about wandering off
in the store?

323
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,610
Oh, come on.

324
00:16:46,353 --> 00:16:47,377
I was getting
ready to say...

325
00:16:47,454 --> 00:16:48,751
That would have
been too much.

326
00:16:51,018 --> 00:16:52,485
Dude. That's him.

327
00:16:53,594 --> 00:16:55,118
Dude, that's our guy.

328
00:17:36,377 --> 00:17:38,242
Oh, Sheriff.

329
00:17:38,313 --> 00:17:39,541
Didn't expect
to see you here.

330
00:17:40,248 --> 00:17:41,840
I live here.
What do you mean?

331
00:17:42,417 --> 00:17:44,214
Of course you do.
Oh...

332
00:17:44,285 --> 00:17:46,219
You're Randy's father.

333
00:17:46,287 --> 00:17:47,686
Yes, wow.

334
00:17:48,123 --> 00:17:51,388
You guys have Bob Barker, Doc
Gooden, and Randy Jackson.

335
00:17:51,459 --> 00:17:53,086
All living in
the same inlet town

336
00:17:53,161 --> 00:17:54,719
with no cars, cell
phones, or internet.

337
00:17:54,796 --> 00:17:56,559
Shawn, we need to pitch
this to Mark Burnett.

338
00:17:56,631 --> 00:17:59,327
You fellas realize
the festival is canceled.

339
00:17:59,634 --> 00:18:03,035
As you know, we lost someone
very dear to us today.

340
00:18:03,104 --> 00:18:04,935
That's actually why
we dropped by, Sheriff.

341
00:18:05,006 --> 00:18:07,975
You see, Gus and I are grief
counselors back in the big city.

342
00:18:08,042 --> 00:18:10,408
And you all have been
so kind and welcoming to us

343
00:18:10,478 --> 00:18:11,740
that we figured
the least we could do

344
00:18:11,813 --> 00:18:14,213
would be to offer our
services before we left town.

345
00:18:14,282 --> 00:18:15,476
Well, come on in, fellas.

346
00:18:16,851 --> 00:18:17,943
Yeah.

347
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,657
I'll confess, Randy and I
haven't been communicating

348
00:18:24,726 --> 00:18:26,216
too well as of late.

349
00:18:27,796 --> 00:18:30,765
I know he's hurting,
but he won't talk to me.

350
00:18:33,902 --> 00:18:35,301
You know,
it wasn't too long ago

351
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,099
that Gus and I
were Randy's age.

352
00:18:37,172 --> 00:18:38,469
It was a pretty
long time ago.

353
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,564
Ah, it wasn't
that long ago.

354
00:18:39,641 --> 00:18:40,630
You like to think so.

355
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,369
I can't do this with you right now.
Fine.

356
00:18:43,077 --> 00:18:44,601
He's upstairs
in his room.

357
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:45,907
We'll give it a shot.

358
00:18:54,289 --> 00:18:56,723
So my dad hired you
to shake me down, right?

359
00:18:57,225 --> 00:18:58,954
I'm fine.
I barely knew Paula.

360
00:19:00,094 --> 00:19:02,858
Then why did the two of you share
secret, special lover earrings?

361
00:19:03,631 --> 00:19:06,828
Come on, Randy.
How long had you been seeing her?

362
00:19:06,901 --> 00:19:08,027
Who are you?

363
00:19:08,436 --> 00:19:10,233
A couple of guys with a
passion for the truth.

364
00:19:10,305 --> 00:19:11,567
And cinnamon.

365
00:19:13,341 --> 00:19:15,104
We'd been together
six months.

366
00:19:16,177 --> 00:19:17,576
Why was it a secret?

367
00:19:17,645 --> 00:19:18,907
It's complicated.

368
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:22,308
<i>I get it. It's Pretty in Pink.
 You're Andrew McCarthy.</i>

369
00:19:23,151 --> 00:19:24,584
Who's Andrew McCarthy?

370
00:19:24,652 --> 00:19:25,676
That's fair.

371
00:19:25,753 --> 00:19:27,243
Where were you
the night Paula died?

372
00:19:27,455 --> 00:19:29,082
I was at the library,
studying.

373
00:19:29,157 --> 00:19:30,488
The librarian
can confirm it.

374
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:32,321
Do you always study
so late on a Friday?

375
00:19:32,427 --> 00:19:34,588
I'm at the library
almost every night.

376
00:19:34,662 --> 00:19:36,289
I've been taking
correspondence courses.

377
00:19:36,364 --> 00:19:37,922
I need a business degree
to be a good leader.

378
00:19:38,433 --> 00:19:39,491
That's true.

379
00:19:42,704 --> 00:19:44,001
I never could
have hurt her.

380
00:19:50,278 --> 00:19:51,575
I loved Paula.

381
00:19:54,282 --> 00:19:56,147
We were gonna see
the world together.

382
00:19:56,851 --> 00:19:58,716
I'm gonna be so
lost without her.

383
00:20:01,422 --> 00:20:02,753
Oh, Paula.

384
00:20:04,993 --> 00:20:06,153
Paula.

385
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,290
Paula.

386
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,357
Paula.

387
00:20:16,371 --> 00:20:17,360
Paula.

388
00:20:17,872 --> 00:20:19,134
That's a little
dramatic, don't you...

389
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,275
You have a problem.

390
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,249
Excuse us.

391
00:20:41,729 --> 00:20:43,697
Keep your
voice down, please.

392
00:20:44,565 --> 00:20:46,328
It's just us
and you.

393
00:20:46,401 --> 00:20:49,234
Just a bunch of words on
paper to you guys, right?

394
00:20:49,304 --> 00:20:50,532
Wrong.

395
00:20:50,605 --> 00:20:53,733
Each is alive
with a story to tell.

396
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,402
Listen.

397
00:20:58,746 --> 00:21:01,271
I'm just
messing with you guys.

398
00:21:02,617 --> 00:21:05,211
Thanks for playing along.
That's really sweet.

399
00:21:05,653 --> 00:21:07,450
I'm Maudette Hornsby.

400
00:21:08,623 --> 00:21:10,181
Isn't cherry the best?

401
00:21:11,659 --> 00:21:12,751
The best what?

402
00:21:13,628 --> 00:21:14,959
Everything, silly.

403
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,392
I thought you were psychic.

404
00:21:17,465 --> 00:21:19,092
I am.
I'm the psychic.

405
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:20,634
But how did
you know that?

406
00:21:20,702 --> 00:21:22,135
Mmm, word travels.

407
00:21:22,203 --> 00:21:24,467
You know, we don't get a
lot of gossip around here.

408
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:27,372
So untimely death,
a psychic,

409
00:21:27,442 --> 00:21:29,034
and a black man,
all in one day.

410
00:21:29,444 --> 00:21:30,468
Epic.

411
00:21:30,545 --> 00:21:32,513
I really thought we
were being discreet.

412
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,070
Do you even know
what discreet is?

413
00:21:34,515 --> 00:21:35,675
That's a
serious question.

414
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,081
I know what...
Shh!

415
00:21:38,386 --> 00:21:40,320
Was Randy Jackson with you
the night Paula died?

416
00:21:40,388 --> 00:21:41,377
Why?

417
00:21:41,456 --> 00:21:44,186
Do you think she was
M- U-R-D-E-R-E-D or something?

418
00:21:44,258 --> 00:21:45,589
M- A-Y-B-E.

419
00:21:46,961 --> 00:21:48,394
Yes, Randy was here.

420
00:21:49,097 --> 00:21:52,624
We have a very
special bond, you see.

421
00:21:53,401 --> 00:21:55,392
His mom passed away
when he was very young.

422
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,097
Sheriff Jackson
never remarried.

423
00:21:57,171 --> 00:22:01,733
So I sort of stepped
in and filled a role.

424
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,704
For both of them.

425
00:22:10,551 --> 00:22:12,712
Is there anything else
you need to know?

426
00:22:12,787 --> 00:22:13,845
Uh...

427
00:22:14,322 --> 00:22:15,789
Feels pretty good
for now.

428
00:22:15,857 --> 00:22:17,085
Do you mind
if we poke around?

429
00:22:17,158 --> 00:22:18,147
Poke?
Peek.

430
00:22:18,226 --> 00:22:19,250
Peek.
Peek around.

431
00:22:19,327 --> 00:22:20,316
Yes.

432
00:22:21,195 --> 00:22:22,457
Knock yourselves out.

433
00:22:23,131 --> 00:22:25,361
Okay, remember
the last email,

434
00:22:25,533 --> 00:22:26,932
the one with all
the weird hieroglyphics?

435
00:22:27,035 --> 00:22:28,161
They were letters
and numbers, Shawn.

436
00:22:28,236 --> 00:22:29,533
Okay, it was one
of these things.

437
00:22:29,604 --> 00:22:30,969
The Dewey
Decimal System?

438
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,336
I didn't even know
they still used this.

439
00:22:32,407 --> 00:22:33,965
That's 'cause people don't
want to crack war codes

440
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:35,066
<i>when the payoff
is Jane Eyre.</i>

441
00:22:35,143 --> 00:22:36,132
What was the
number, Shawn?

442
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:38,804
F-7-9-6-dot-3-5-2.

443
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,110
Seven hundred's that's
sports and recreation.

444
00:22:49,057 --> 00:22:50,922
These books
are archaic.

445
00:22:50,992 --> 00:22:52,186
And really old.

446
00:22:53,928 --> 00:22:55,395
Except this one.

447
00:22:58,366 --> 00:22:59,697
By Earl Wyndam.

448
00:22:59,767 --> 00:23:01,598
My short game
could use some work.

449
00:23:03,538 --> 00:23:04,869
There's no pictures?

450
00:23:05,473 --> 00:23:07,805
This is the weirdest
golf book I've ever seen.

451
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:08,967
Let me see that.

452
00:23:12,346 --> 00:23:15,281
Our emailer wants us to think
that Paula was reincarnated?

453
00:23:15,349 --> 00:23:16,475
We should get
back to the lake.

454
00:23:16,551 --> 00:23:18,178
Juliet should have
something by now.

455
00:23:20,688 --> 00:23:22,053
You're gonna need
a library card

456
00:23:22,123 --> 00:23:23,556
if you want to check
something out.

457
00:23:24,892 --> 00:23:26,655
I think we're good,
Maudette.

458
00:23:31,966 --> 00:23:33,593
Juliet, it's Gus.

459
00:23:34,936 --> 00:23:37,166
Gus, what's going on?
Is Shawn okay?

460
00:23:37,238 --> 00:23:38,830
Oh, he's fine.
Tell her I said "Hi."

461
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,505
Ask her what
she's wearing.

462
00:23:40,575 --> 00:23:42,008
Do you have anything
on Paula Merral?

463
00:23:42,376 --> 00:23:43,365
Do I?

464
00:23:43,444 --> 00:23:44,934
Look, I don't know
what you guys

465
00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:46,240
have gotten yourselves
into up there,

466
00:23:46,314 --> 00:23:48,908
but Paula Merral drowned
here seven years ago.

467
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:52,545
What?

468
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,746
Did she say "Hi" back?

469
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,575
Is he looking at us?

470
00:24:07,945 --> 00:24:08,969
I think he is.

471
00:24:12,316 --> 00:24:14,113
Dude, take it easy.
That's your seventh piece.

472
00:24:14,185 --> 00:24:16,016
You know I get hungry
when I get freaked out.

473
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:17,418
Besides, you've had five.

474
00:24:17,488 --> 00:24:19,149
Exactly, I believe
in portion control.

475
00:24:19,223 --> 00:24:20,747
A girl drowns,
gets reincarnated,

476
00:24:20,825 --> 00:24:22,349
and drowns again
seven years later?

477
00:24:22,426 --> 00:24:23,484
Worst cinnamon festival ever.

478
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:28,588
We definitely
stick out around here.

479
00:24:28,766 --> 00:24:30,631
True, but not
as bad as them.

480
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,563
What are you
staring at, Jesup?

481
00:24:38,075 --> 00:24:39,133
Scoot.

482
00:24:39,543 --> 00:24:42,706
Wow, did you guys just
hoof it from the highway?

483
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,372
What? Oh, hell no.

484
00:24:44,448 --> 00:24:46,109
No, we took the seven-mile
dirt road that connects

485
00:24:46,183 --> 00:24:47,946
this crap hole
to the next town over.

486
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,486
We came up here because
the chief wanted us

487
00:24:49,553 --> 00:24:51,453
to get a positive ID
on Paula Merral's body.

488
00:24:51,522 --> 00:24:53,353
To see if it matched the one
found in Santa Barbara?

489
00:24:53,424 --> 00:24:54,516
No, see
that's the thing.

490
00:24:54,592 --> 00:24:55,991
We never
recovered her body.

491
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,493
Which didn't
sit well with me.

492
00:24:57,862 --> 00:25:00,262
The inlet where she supposedly
drowned has no current,

493
00:25:00,331 --> 00:25:01,992
which means her body
should have floated up

494
00:25:02,066 --> 00:25:04,193
between 2.3 to 3.1 days.

495
00:25:05,603 --> 00:25:06,934
Oh, I know this because
waiting for corpses

496
00:25:07,004 --> 00:25:08,494
to resurface is
a passion in my life.

497
00:25:08,706 --> 00:25:10,970
The sweater she was wearing
was found on the shoreline.

498
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:13,476
And her bike was discovered
at the end of a nearby dock.

499
00:25:13,544 --> 00:25:15,739
It was lying next to a
pile of sunflower seeds,

500
00:25:15,813 --> 00:25:17,007
which was also weird.

501
00:25:17,081 --> 00:25:19,549
What 11-year-old girl
chews sunflower seeds?

502
00:25:24,221 --> 00:25:25,347
Excuse me, Flo.

503
00:25:25,656 --> 00:25:28,022
Where might we find the proprietors
of this fine establishment?

504
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:29,524
Robert and Michelle?

505
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,126
They've been home ever since
they got the news about Paula.

506
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,788
Do you have something you
want to tell us, Mr. Barker?

507
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,032
Twelve years ago,
Michelle's sister, Lucy

508
00:25:46,101 --> 00:25:47,363
ran away from Dual Spires,

509
00:25:47,436 --> 00:25:49,165
taking seven-year-old
Paula with her.

510
00:25:49,738 --> 00:25:51,296
We were worried
sick about Paula.

511
00:25:51,473 --> 00:25:54,636
See, Lucy was an incredibly
unstable person.

512
00:25:55,277 --> 00:25:57,336
Michelle and I practically
raised her daughter for her.

513
00:25:57,746 --> 00:26:00,374
Then one day, we got
a letter from Paula

514
00:26:00,449 --> 00:26:02,110
confirming
our worst fears.

515
00:26:02,584 --> 00:26:04,245
It described how
magic white rocks

516
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:05,718
were making
her mom crazy.

517
00:26:05,787 --> 00:26:06,981
Methamphetamines?

518
00:26:07,055 --> 00:26:08,147
Along with other stuff.

519
00:26:08,223 --> 00:26:09,383
A couple of letters
after that

520
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:10,857
was the first mention
of the abuse.

521
00:26:10,926 --> 00:26:12,723
And that's when
we knew we had to act.

522
00:26:12,794 --> 00:26:14,523
You helped her
fake her death?

523
00:26:14,596 --> 00:26:16,757
We had no other choice.
Lucy wouldn't let her go.

524
00:26:16,832 --> 00:26:17,890
And Paula
was all for it.

525
00:26:17,966 --> 00:26:19,456
In fact,
it was her idea.

526
00:26:19,568 --> 00:26:20,796
It doesn't matter.

527
00:26:20,869 --> 00:26:22,302
What you did
was against the law.

528
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,065
If I had jurisdiction here,
you'd be under arrest

529
00:26:24,139 --> 00:26:25,470
for obstruction
of justice.

530
00:26:25,907 --> 00:26:27,204
She was happy here.

531
00:26:27,275 --> 00:26:28,367
And safe.

532
00:26:28,443 --> 00:26:29,705
Until two days ago.

533
00:26:30,445 --> 00:26:31,434
Right.

534
00:26:31,913 --> 00:26:33,437
I'm heading
back to Santa Barbara

535
00:26:33,515 --> 00:26:35,176
to reopen this
case, Mr. Barker.

536
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,274
Once I do,

537
00:26:36,351 --> 00:26:37,784
a warrant will be
issued for your arrest.

538
00:26:38,019 --> 00:26:39,281
Come on, O'Hara.

539
00:26:39,788 --> 00:26:41,050
Call when you can.

540
00:26:42,324 --> 00:26:44,019
You two
understand, right?

541
00:26:44,092 --> 00:26:45,855
We're not here to judge you, Mr.
Barker.

542
00:26:45,927 --> 00:26:48,896
We came to investigate, catch
bad guys, and eat pie.

543
00:26:48,964 --> 00:26:50,158
Not necessarily
in that order.

544
00:26:50,232 --> 00:26:51,392
And it hasn't been.
No.

545
00:26:51,466 --> 00:26:52,728
We started with the pie.
Always.

546
00:26:53,368 --> 00:26:55,734
Do you think we could take
a look in Paula's room?

547
00:26:56,271 --> 00:26:57,932
By all means.
We haven't touched a thing.

548
00:26:58,039 --> 00:26:59,939
It's at the top of the
stairs on the right.

549
00:27:02,878 --> 00:27:05,608
Dude, the Dr.
Ombudsman wasn't kidding.

550
00:27:05,714 --> 00:27:07,341
Sister definitely
had a dark side.

551
00:27:07,783 --> 00:27:08,841
Hmm.

552
00:27:10,218 --> 00:27:11,310
What are you doing?

553
00:27:11,453 --> 00:27:13,444
Looking for places
she may have hid stuff.

554
00:27:19,594 --> 00:27:21,789
Every teenager has
a secret spot, Gus.

555
00:27:21,863 --> 00:27:22,887
Remember when
I found those

556
00:27:22,964 --> 00:27:24,693
weird photos of John
Cusack in your nightstand?

557
00:27:24,766 --> 00:27:25,824
That was Joan.

558
00:27:26,368 --> 00:27:27,460
Really?

559
00:27:27,536 --> 00:27:28,935
Oh, that's
much less weird.

560
00:27:29,004 --> 00:27:31,802
Wait. No, it's not.
Not really. Incoming.

561
00:27:35,577 --> 00:27:36,839
Dude.

562
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,717
Diary. Jackpot.

563
00:27:43,785 --> 00:27:45,150
What does it say?

564
00:27:46,354 --> 00:27:48,083
"Math was really
hard today."

565
00:27:48,156 --> 00:27:49,384
Blah, blah, blah.

566
00:27:49,457 --> 00:27:51,550
Seems like normal
high school stuff to me.

567
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,488
Whoa.

568
00:27:54,196 --> 00:27:55,891
What is this language?
Is this Chinese?

569
00:27:55,964 --> 00:27:57,090
No.

570
00:27:58,233 --> 00:27:59,666
It's Latin, Shawn.

571
00:27:59,734 --> 00:28:01,065
Latin?

572
00:28:01,736 --> 00:28:04,170
Gus, Paula must have thought
someone was reading her diary.

573
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:05,433
We gotta find out
what that says.

574
00:28:05,507 --> 00:28:07,475
Yeah, but who do we
know that speaks Latin.

575
00:28:08,176 --> 00:28:10,644
<i>"Absens... Haeres."</i>

576
00:28:10,979 --> 00:28:11,968
Hairy ass?

577
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,645
<i>"Non erit."
Did you get all that?</i>

578
00:28:14,216 --> 00:28:15,911
Uh-huh.
I believe so.

579
00:28:15,984 --> 00:28:17,576
Haven't you ever heard
of faxing, Shawn?

580
00:28:17,652 --> 00:28:18,641
<i>I'm sorry, Father.</i>

581
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,709
<i>We don't have that
capability right now.</i>

582
00:28:19,821 --> 00:28:21,254
Besides, I thought
that priests thought

583
00:28:21,323 --> 00:28:22,585
all technology was evil.

584
00:28:22,657 --> 00:28:24,215
It's only now that it
begins to dawn on me

585
00:28:24,292 --> 00:28:26,385
how little you learned
in my CCD class.

586
00:28:26,461 --> 00:28:28,326
Look, Father, it's very
important that we understand

587
00:28:28,396 --> 00:28:29,954
what these passages mean.

588
00:28:30,031 --> 00:28:32,329
All right, all right.
Well, this first part talks about

589
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,198
a young boy she was seeing.
Someone popular.

590
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,328
Randy.

591
00:28:36,404 --> 00:28:37,393
Yeah, that makes sense.

592
00:28:37,472 --> 00:28:38,632
<i>She refers to him as "R."</i>

593
00:28:39,307 --> 00:28:41,298
Ah, she may have also
been seeing someone else.

594
00:28:41,376 --> 00:28:42,707
Excellent,
is there a name?

595
00:28:42,777 --> 00:28:44,176
No, just the letter "J."

596
00:28:44,246 --> 00:28:45,611
Letter "J."

597
00:28:45,847 --> 00:28:47,644
All right, thank you Father.
You've been so much help.

598
00:28:47,716 --> 00:28:48,944
<i>Gus will see you
at church on Sunday.</i>

599
00:28:49,017 --> 00:28:50,177
Uh-huh, what about you?

600
00:28:51,152 --> 00:28:52,779
What? Oh,
you're breaking up.

601
00:28:52,854 --> 00:28:53,980
What? What...

602
00:28:54,055 --> 00:28:56,046
Can't hear anything.
Hello? Father?

603
00:28:56,124 --> 00:28:58,115
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
There's more.

604
00:28:58,426 --> 00:29:01,327
It really is one square
foot of coverage.

605
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,298
Jules, what are
you doing here?

606
00:29:04,366 --> 00:29:07,164
Well, Lassiter's handling the reopening
of the case back at the department,

607
00:29:07,235 --> 00:29:08,634
so I thought I would come
back and lend a hand.

608
00:29:08,703 --> 00:29:10,364
Fantastic. We have
to hit the library,

609
00:29:10,438 --> 00:29:11,962
follow up on
a vision I just had.

610
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,200
All right, well,
you two go ahead.

611
00:29:13,275 --> 00:29:14,299
I'm gonna notify
Sheriff Jackson

612
00:29:14,376 --> 00:29:15,536
that I'm gonna be
looking into the case.

613
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:17,043
What do you say we all
meet up at the diner at,

614
00:29:17,112 --> 00:29:18,340
uh... 4:30?

615
00:29:19,547 --> 00:29:20,844
Labradoodle!
Where?

616
00:29:22,684 --> 00:29:23,981
We should go.

617
00:29:24,052 --> 00:29:25,349
I didn't see any
labradoodle, Shawn.

618
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,751
Well, you weren't
looking very hard.

619
00:29:32,861 --> 00:29:33,885
Nice shoes.

620
00:29:33,962 --> 00:29:35,293
I know.

621
00:29:35,931 --> 00:29:37,455
Gus was wondering if you
would like to be his date

622
00:29:37,532 --> 00:29:39,056
to Betty Boop Night
at the Road House.

623
00:29:39,134 --> 00:29:41,193
They don't have a Betty Boop
Night at the Road House.

624
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:43,260
Oh, then they don't have my
business anymore, either.

625
00:29:43,338 --> 00:29:44,896
Sure you can
keep up with me?

626
00:29:45,874 --> 00:29:48,672
I like to dance
all night long.

627
00:29:54,282 --> 00:29:56,375
Well... Shawn.

628
00:29:56,952 --> 00:29:58,078
What?

629
00:29:58,153 --> 00:29:59,450
Relax.

630
00:29:59,654 --> 00:30:01,053
Okay, here we go.

631
00:30:01,289 --> 00:30:03,484
This is the most recent
Dual Spires's yearbook.

632
00:30:03,825 --> 00:30:06,225
Thank you, Maudette.
Feels a little thin.

633
00:30:06,294 --> 00:30:07,556
Small book
for a small school.

634
00:30:07,629 --> 00:30:09,756
There were only six people
in the graduating class?

635
00:30:09,831 --> 00:30:11,264
Yeah, and even
that was large.

636
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:12,459
Mine only had three.

637
00:30:12,534 --> 00:30:14,126
You, Robert, and Michelle?

638
00:30:14,202 --> 00:30:16,102
You're very impressive,
Mr. Spencer.

639
00:30:16,905 --> 00:30:18,736
None of the guys
in Paula's class

640
00:30:18,807 --> 00:30:20,240
have names that
begin with "J."

641
00:30:20,308 --> 00:30:21,707
Let's see here.

642
00:30:22,911 --> 00:30:24,640
Paula sure is
in a lot of photos.

643
00:30:24,713 --> 00:30:26,237
Oh, that's not surprising.

644
00:30:26,314 --> 00:30:28,009
She loved the attention.

645
00:30:42,063 --> 00:30:43,257
Huh.

646
00:30:44,265 --> 00:30:45,493
Thank you, Maudette.

647
00:30:48,136 --> 00:30:49,262
Bye, Gus.

648
00:31:00,915 --> 00:31:02,644
Whoa, Jack.

649
00:31:02,717 --> 00:31:03,979
You didn't even
give me a chance

650
00:31:04,052 --> 00:31:05,144
to see if I had
food in my teeth.

651
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,312
They're good.

652
00:31:06,388 --> 00:31:08,117
I'm Shawn.
He's Blackmunn.

653
00:31:08,189 --> 00:31:09,588
Yeah, yeah.
I know who you are.

654
00:31:09,657 --> 00:31:14,219
Oh, good, so you know we're here to
ask you some questions about Paula.

655
00:31:17,365 --> 00:31:19,890
You, uh, you ever
think about hanging

656
00:31:19,968 --> 00:31:21,663
any of your photos
on the wall?

657
00:31:22,003 --> 00:31:23,698
Well, to me, each photo
is like a memory,

658
00:31:23,772 --> 00:31:25,637
so I like to keep them close.

659
00:31:26,188 --> 00:31:28,918
Looks like you and Paula were
more than just friends, huh?

660
00:31:30,793 --> 00:31:32,283
Yeah, we were.

661
00:31:32,361 --> 00:31:35,353
Until about a year ago, she
left me for the Cinnamon King.

662
00:31:35,731 --> 00:31:37,392
You must have been
pretty angry with her.

663
00:31:38,434 --> 00:31:40,231
At first I was, yeah.

664
00:31:40,302 --> 00:31:43,294
But then we became best friends.
I was her confidant.

665
00:31:43,406 --> 00:31:45,636
And we would lip synch
to old records together.

666
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:47,437
<i>Jon Cryer from
Pretty in Pink.</i>

667
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:49,944
No one in this town has ever
seen that movie, Shawn.

668
00:31:50,012 --> 00:31:51,673
Well, I refuse
to accept that.

669
00:31:53,182 --> 00:31:55,377
Oops! Jack,
that's my bad.

670
00:31:55,451 --> 00:31:57,043
Uh... Let me
clean this up.

671
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:58,609
No, no, no, no.
Don't, don't, don't.

672
00:31:59,288 --> 00:32:01,313
The broken glass will make
for a beautiful photo.

673
00:32:02,792 --> 00:32:04,089
Yeah, it will.

674
00:32:08,564 --> 00:32:10,031
So what do you think?
You think this guy killed Paula?

675
00:32:10,099 --> 00:32:11,464
Most definitely.

676
00:32:11,834 --> 00:32:14,302
He's a freaky dude
living in a freaky place.

677
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:15,667
And have you noticed
he won't ever make

678
00:32:15,738 --> 00:32:16,762
eye contact with you?

679
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:18,101
There's only
one reason for that.

680
00:32:18,174 --> 00:32:19,163
Guilt.

681
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,171
Actually, there
may be another.

682
00:32:27,316 --> 00:32:28,305
Hey, Jack.

683
00:32:28,984 --> 00:32:31,111
The glass is
over here, man.

684
00:32:33,622 --> 00:32:35,249
I know.
Yeah.

685
00:32:39,495 --> 00:32:41,759
I gotta tell you, you are
the highest functioning

686
00:32:41,831 --> 00:32:43,492
blind person
that I've ever seen.

687
00:32:46,202 --> 00:32:48,500
I'm not technically blind.

688
00:32:48,938 --> 00:32:51,099
I still have 30% vision
in my right eye

689
00:32:52,241 --> 00:32:53,469
for now.

690
00:32:54,043 --> 00:32:56,170
A couple of years ago,
I developed early onset

691
00:32:56,245 --> 00:32:57,303
macular degeneration.

692
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,940
I'm sensing
it was around '05.

693
00:33:01,517 --> 00:33:02,779
Yeah, that's right.

694
00:33:02,852 --> 00:33:04,911
Where were you
the night Paula disappeared?

695
00:33:05,321 --> 00:33:06,379
I was with her.

696
00:33:06,989 --> 00:33:09,116
At the beginning
of the night.

697
00:33:10,025 --> 00:33:13,859
We took a walk in the forest,
and she told me

698
00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:15,954
she wanted
to leave Dual Spires.

699
00:33:16,031 --> 00:33:18,261
I said that
was a mistake.

700
00:33:18,334 --> 00:33:20,825
And then, jet blackness.

701
00:33:21,036 --> 00:33:22,025
What does that mean?

702
00:33:22,104 --> 00:33:23,594
It would be a great
porn name for you.

703
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:25,204
I woke up about
an hour later.

704
00:33:25,374 --> 00:33:29,276
With this,
a bump on my head.

705
00:33:29,612 --> 00:33:31,011
And there was no Paula.

706
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,274
She knocked you out?

707
00:33:32,348 --> 00:33:33,815
Come on, Jack.
A big guy like you?

708
00:33:33,883 --> 00:33:34,975
No, no, no.

709
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:36,813
Somebody else snuck up on me,

710
00:33:36,886 --> 00:33:38,513
and I wasn't looking.

711
00:33:38,621 --> 00:33:39,918
Well, you could
have been looking.

712
00:33:39,989 --> 00:33:41,217
Probably wouldn't have
made much of a difference.

713
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:42,450
He's practically blind.

714
00:33:42,525 --> 00:33:44,686
Why didn't you take any of
this to the sheriff, Jack?

715
00:33:45,294 --> 00:33:47,626
Because I may have been
the last person

716
00:33:47,696 --> 00:33:48,924
to ever see her alive,

717
00:33:48,998 --> 00:33:51,432
and my story
sounds fishy at best.

718
00:33:51,901 --> 00:33:53,596
I mean, do you believe me?

719
00:33:54,436 --> 00:33:56,563
Were you taking photos
that night on the walk?

720
00:33:57,239 --> 00:33:58,604
Yeah, yeah.
Of course I was.

721
00:33:58,874 --> 00:34:01,172
Well, why don't you let us
take a look at that film?

722
00:34:02,311 --> 00:34:03,801
Okay.

723
00:34:03,879 --> 00:34:05,676
Ooh.
Why?

724
00:34:06,148 --> 00:34:07,445
Oh, this is good.

725
00:34:07,516 --> 00:34:10,178
This will go well with
the five shots of her boots.

726
00:34:10,886 --> 00:34:12,751
Take a blindfolded
photo sometime.

727
00:34:12,822 --> 00:34:14,813
Let me know
how it turns out.

728
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:16,721
Wait a second.
Here's something.

729
00:34:22,765 --> 00:34:24,323
Dude, we gotta
get to Jules.

730
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,180
Hi, I'm looking
for Sheriff Jackson.

731
00:34:35,348 --> 00:34:36,872
The deputy said
I could find him here.

732
00:34:37,584 --> 00:34:40,451
Yeah, uh, he just
stepped out for a sec.

733
00:34:41,655 --> 00:34:42,883
Do you know
when he'll be back?

734
00:34:43,089 --> 00:34:44,147
Oh, any minute now.

735
00:34:44,224 --> 00:34:45,987
You can wait
in the back with me.

736
00:34:46,092 --> 00:34:48,390
I'm just doing a little
work for shop class.

737
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,820
Okay.
I'm Juliet O'Hara.

738
00:34:51,498 --> 00:34:53,489
Randy.
Randy Jackson.

739
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:26,751
How much do you weigh?

740
00:35:27,356 --> 00:35:28,414
Excuse me?

741
00:35:28,858 --> 00:35:31,622
I'm sorry, I'm not supposed to
ask a woman that question, am I?

742
00:35:31,861 --> 00:35:34,056
Not unless you're
piloting a very small plane.

743
00:35:37,266 --> 00:35:38,597
About 105?

744
00:35:38,734 --> 00:35:39,962
Will your dad
be here soon?

745
00:35:40,036 --> 00:35:41,765
I imagine so.

746
00:35:42,371 --> 00:35:43,668
Paula weighed about 105.

747
00:35:44,206 --> 00:35:45,867
You kind of
remind me of her.

748
00:35:46,709 --> 00:35:48,700
I understand you two
were quite close.

749
00:35:49,712 --> 00:35:51,111
I'm sorry for your loss.

750
00:35:51,614 --> 00:35:53,639
Yeah, it's a
real tragedy.

751
00:35:54,717 --> 00:35:56,275
You know what?

752
00:35:56,352 --> 00:35:58,377
Why don't I just come back
in, like, an hour or so.

753
00:35:58,454 --> 00:35:59,614
No.

754
00:36:00,356 --> 00:36:01,448
Stay.

755
00:36:05,928 --> 00:36:07,156
Hey!

756
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:09,191
Get your wood
out of her face, Randy.

757
00:36:09,532 --> 00:36:12,399
What's going on?
We know you knocked out Jack Smith,

758
00:36:12,468 --> 00:36:14,265
when he was with Paula
the night she died.

759
00:36:14,337 --> 00:36:16,202
Yeah, I thought he was trying
to steal my girlfriend.

760
00:36:16,405 --> 00:36:17,736
Really?
You're jealous of the goofy kid

761
00:36:17,807 --> 00:36:19,672
who snaps photos
like Jose Feliciano?

762
00:36:19,742 --> 00:36:21,334
Hey, Paula always
had a thing for him.

763
00:36:21,677 --> 00:36:23,042
For Jose Feliciano?

764
00:36:23,112 --> 00:36:24,374
No, Jack.

765
00:36:24,547 --> 00:36:26,947
I just gave him a super elbow
and he crumbled like feta.

766
00:36:27,249 --> 00:36:28,341
What did Paula do?

767
00:36:28,417 --> 00:36:29,714
She freaked out
and went on this rant

768
00:36:29,785 --> 00:36:30,911
about how I'm a hypocrite

769
00:36:30,986 --> 00:36:32,851
'cause I spend a lot of time
with my ex-girlfriend.

770
00:36:32,922 --> 00:36:34,014
And who's that?

771
00:36:35,624 --> 00:36:36,886
That's none of your business.

772
00:36:37,693 --> 00:36:39,524
What is it with all the secret
relationships in this town?

773
00:36:39,595 --> 00:36:41,062
<i>It's like
General Hospital.</i>

774
00:36:43,466 --> 00:36:44,990
You're kidding me.

775
00:36:45,067 --> 00:36:46,227
All right, that's it.

776
00:36:46,302 --> 00:36:48,327
Is there a film,
or a television series,

777
00:36:48,404 --> 00:36:49,928
that you people actually saw?

778
00:36:50,005 --> 00:36:51,870
The town gets together
every Thursday night

779
00:36:51,941 --> 00:36:53,203
<i>to watch
reruns of Everwood.</i>

780
00:36:53,509 --> 00:36:55,340
Okay, I can work with that.

781
00:36:55,411 --> 00:36:56,605
What happened next?

782
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:58,840
She got mad at me
for hurting a blind person.

783
00:36:58,914 --> 00:37:00,381
She then went
to find help for Jack.

784
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:01,908
I offered to go with her,

785
00:37:01,984 --> 00:37:03,952
but she wanted
nothing to do with me.

786
00:37:04,019 --> 00:37:05,577
So I tied his
shoelaces together,

787
00:37:05,654 --> 00:37:07,918
and went to the library
and waited to hear from her.

788
00:37:11,127 --> 00:37:13,095
Of course,

789
00:37:13,529 --> 00:37:14,518
I never did.

790
00:37:15,331 --> 00:37:17,959
<i>Just like Treat Williams'
character on Everwood.</i>

791
00:37:18,033 --> 00:37:19,364
Never got to say
good-bye to his wife.

792
00:37:19,435 --> 00:37:20,493
Shawn.

793
00:37:22,705 --> 00:37:25,538
Look, I'm telling
you guys the truth.

794
00:37:25,608 --> 00:37:27,439
Plus, I have an alibi,
remember?

795
00:37:28,644 --> 00:37:29,975
All right.

796
00:37:30,446 --> 00:37:32,311
But we're on
to you, Randy.

797
00:37:32,381 --> 00:37:34,542
Just like the townspeople of
Everwood were on to the fact

798
00:37:34,617 --> 00:37:35,879
that Nina was
a surrogate mother.

799
00:37:35,951 --> 00:37:37,782
Will you stop it?
Enough.

800
00:37:39,922 --> 00:37:40,911
She was.

801
00:37:41,357 --> 00:37:42,381
Thank you.

802
00:37:44,927 --> 00:37:46,952
So, who do we think
Randy's ex is?

803
00:37:47,229 --> 00:37:48,856
Mmm, Jules, you gotta
order a piece of this pie.

804
00:37:48,964 --> 00:37:51,159
I did. You guys
immediately ate it.

805
00:37:51,233 --> 00:37:54,100
Well, it's gotta be someone
who's into the creepsters,

806
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:56,161
but I'm guessing she's older,
'cause I'm yet to see

807
00:37:56,238 --> 00:37:57,728
a woman under the
age of 35 in this town.

808
00:37:57,807 --> 00:37:59,798
It's also someone that Randy
spends consistent time with.

809
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:01,399
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

810
00:38:04,513 --> 00:38:05,673
I'm getting something.

811
00:38:06,048 --> 00:38:07,515
I'm at the library
almost every night.

812
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:10,378
Randy and I have a very
special bond, you see.

813
00:38:12,121 --> 00:38:13,782
Four slices to go, please.

814
00:38:14,924 --> 00:38:17,324
If Maudette was sleeping
with Randy, that's gross.

815
00:38:17,393 --> 00:38:18,655
She practically raised him.

816
00:38:18,727 --> 00:38:19,989
The only thing that
would make it grosser

817
00:38:20,062 --> 00:38:21,393
is if she wasn't attractive.

818
00:38:21,464 --> 00:38:22,954
What's wrong with you?

819
00:38:23,032 --> 00:38:25,933
This goes beyond Maudette
getting her Pamela Smart on.

820
00:38:26,001 --> 00:38:27,161
I think she killed Paula.

821
00:38:27,236 --> 00:38:28,362
What?
How do you figure?

822
00:38:28,437 --> 00:38:30,905
I'm sensing that Randy went
to the library that night

823
00:38:30,973 --> 00:38:32,270
to finally tell Maudette

824
00:38:32,341 --> 00:38:34,172
that he and Paula
were leaving Dual Spires.

825
00:38:34,477 --> 00:38:36,172
Sent her into
a jealous rage.

826
00:38:36,245 --> 00:38:38,270
She snuck out,
killed Paula,

827
00:38:38,347 --> 00:38:39,939
because if she
couldn't have Randy,

828
00:38:40,015 --> 00:38:41,380
no woman would.

829
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:42,747
That changes everything.

830
00:38:43,953 --> 00:38:46,148
Remind me to never have
an affair with an older woman

831
00:38:46,222 --> 00:38:47,712
or a librarian.

832
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:49,155
Maudette.

833
00:38:50,693 --> 00:38:52,320
That's not good.
Oh.

834
00:38:52,761 --> 00:38:54,524
I am so sick
of this town.

835
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,791
Go ahead and wheel her around
the corner to my office.

836
00:39:11,347 --> 00:39:13,474
I can't believe
Maudette Hornsby

837
00:39:13,549 --> 00:39:15,380
was taking
advantage of my son.

838
00:39:16,685 --> 00:39:18,448
Taking advantage
is a little strong.

839
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:20,250
The dude was 17
and she was fine.

840
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:23,151
What exactly constitutes
the difference between

841
00:39:23,225 --> 00:39:25,420
altar boy Gus
and degenerate Gus?

842
00:39:25,494 --> 00:39:27,655
Reputation
was everything to Maudette.

843
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:30,221
The prospect of the town
knowing about that scandal

844
00:39:30,299 --> 00:39:32,062
was probably more
than she could live with.

845
00:39:32,134 --> 00:39:34,227
I better speak to my boy.

846
00:39:34,303 --> 00:39:36,533
And I'll get on
that autopsy.

847
00:39:38,374 --> 00:39:39,432
The fact that
she murdered someone

848
00:39:39,508 --> 00:39:41,533
may have also
hurt her reputation.

849
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:43,339
All right, I'm gonna get back
and brief the department.

850
00:39:43,412 --> 00:39:44,401
Do you want me to drive
you to your car?

851
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,572
No.
Yes.

852
00:39:46,549 --> 00:39:47,641
We'll meet you
back there in a bit.

853
00:39:47,716 --> 00:39:48,808
Okay.

854
00:39:49,451 --> 00:39:50,850
Why are we not getting
the hell out of here?

855
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,615
Because my theory
is half-baked, Gus.

856
00:39:52,755 --> 00:39:54,347
Something isn't
sitting right with me.

857
00:39:54,423 --> 00:39:56,254
You know what's not sitting
right with me, Shawn?

858
00:39:56,325 --> 00:39:58,657
Being stuck in a tiny town
with no phone access

859
00:39:58,727 --> 00:40:00,251
and all white people.
Let's go.

860
00:40:03,799 --> 00:40:04,891
Now where are you going?

861
00:40:09,338 --> 00:40:10,930
If we leave now, I'll
let you play the theme

862
00:40:11,006 --> 00:40:12,974
<i>to Weird Science over and
over in the car. What do you say?</i>

863
00:40:13,042 --> 00:40:15,169
That's happening regardless.
This way.

864
00:40:25,087 --> 00:40:27,920
Here is the most recent
Dual Spires yearbook.

865
00:40:30,859 --> 00:40:32,417
Maudette was
the one emailing us.

866
00:40:32,494 --> 00:40:33,586
That makes no sense.

867
00:40:33,662 --> 00:40:35,630
Why would the killer lure
detectives to the scene

868
00:40:35,698 --> 00:40:36,995
and then start
feeding them clues?

869
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,091
Because she
didn't kill Paula, Gus.

870
00:40:41,437 --> 00:40:42,768
I'm never gonna
leave this town.

871
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:43,896
She suspected foul play

872
00:40:43,973 --> 00:40:45,167
and knew she'd be
the prime suspect

873
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,435
if anyone found out about her
relationship with Randy.

874
00:40:47,943 --> 00:40:49,308
So she started snooping
around on her own,

875
00:40:49,378 --> 00:40:52,313
discovered the drowning seven
years ago in Santa Barbara.

876
00:40:52,381 --> 00:40:53,814
Found us on the Internet.

877
00:40:53,882 --> 00:40:55,247
So who killed Paula Merral?

878
00:40:55,317 --> 00:40:57,410
I don't know,
but we're gonna find out.

879
00:41:02,858 --> 00:41:03,847
Gus,
stop messing around.

880
00:41:03,926 --> 00:41:05,484
I'm not, Shawn.

881
00:41:08,163 --> 00:41:09,391
Shawn?
Yes, Gus.

882
00:41:09,765 --> 00:41:11,164
Something's burning.

883
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,833
I see that.

884
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:15,997
Help us!
Somebody help us.

885
00:41:16,071 --> 00:41:18,164
We're stuck
in this tiny room!

886
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,605
Help us!
Let us out!

887
00:41:22,953 --> 00:41:25,012
Shawn, we're gonna die in
this tiny, stupid room.

888
00:41:25,089 --> 00:41:28,149
<i>Gus, don't be the scream
from Holding Back the Years.</i>

889
00:41:28,426 --> 00:41:30,223
You're right, though.
This could be it for us.

890
00:41:30,328 --> 00:41:31,989
Man, we are gonna burn!

891
00:41:32,063 --> 00:41:33,189
I know.

892
00:41:42,273 --> 00:41:43,763
No, wait, wait!
Who are you?

893
00:41:47,778 --> 00:41:48,938
Gus!

894
00:41:59,757 --> 00:42:02,089
Father Westley.
Thank God you were here, literally.

895
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,560
We were about to be Wicker
Men, How did you find us?

896
00:42:04,629 --> 00:42:05,857
I just had faith.

897
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:07,921
Really?
No, boys.

898
00:42:08,131 --> 00:42:10,827
I just got to town,
I saw the fire,

899
00:42:10,902 --> 00:42:13,462
I saw the tandem bicycle outside.
It all added up.

900
00:42:13,872 --> 00:42:15,840
But how did you know we were
in trouble in the first place?

901
00:42:15,907 --> 00:42:18,205
You hung up on me when I was
transcribing the Latin, Shawn.

902
00:42:18,276 --> 00:42:19,834
I just
I got excited.

903
00:42:19,911 --> 00:42:21,139
I took one little
step to the left.

904
00:42:21,212 --> 00:42:24,909
And that girl, Paula.
She felt she was in danger. She was afraid.

905
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:27,150
Which led me to be afraid
for the two of you.

906
00:42:27,552 --> 00:42:28,917
And, honestly,
I owed you one anyway

907
00:42:28,987 --> 00:42:30,784
because of that
whole exorcism thing.

908
00:42:31,523 --> 00:42:33,286
What happened to your hair?

909
00:42:33,458 --> 00:42:35,892
Oh. Yeah, it was
an ill-advised attempt

910
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,360
to cover up some gray
that went terribly awry.

911
00:42:39,097 --> 00:42:42,066
But technically,
Sister Rita's to blame.

912
00:42:43,301 --> 00:42:44,700
She's the one
that did my hair.

913
00:42:47,171 --> 00:42:49,162
Guys, get in.
We don't have much time.

914
00:42:49,307 --> 00:42:50,467
You have a car?
What gives?

915
00:42:50,542 --> 00:42:51,702
Why should we trust you?

916
00:42:51,776 --> 00:42:53,141
You probably shouldn't,
but if you stay here

917
00:42:53,211 --> 00:42:54,610
you're gonna be sitting
ducks for whoever it was

918
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:55,976
that tried to burn
you guys alive.

919
00:42:56,047 --> 00:42:58,072
I'll explain everything
at the cabin. Get in.

920
00:43:13,364 --> 00:43:15,457
Have a seat,
I'll make a fire.

921
00:43:18,036 --> 00:43:20,561
All right, we're listening.

922
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:24,406
My great grandfather founded Dual Spires.
That's him there.

923
00:43:25,977 --> 00:43:27,342
I might have
guessed that one.

924
00:43:27,579 --> 00:43:29,604
After World War I ended,

925
00:43:29,681 --> 00:43:32,673
he'd seen the
absolute worst in man.

926
00:43:32,784 --> 00:43:34,342
He decided to settle here

927
00:43:34,419 --> 00:43:36,819
with two other soldiers from his
squadron and their families.

928
00:43:36,988 --> 00:43:39,286
<i>I was wrong, it isn't Witness.
 This is The Village.</i>

929
00:43:39,357 --> 00:43:41,416
<i>The Village
was a ridiculous film.</i>

930
00:43:41,492 --> 00:43:44,620
"Those we do not speak of."
Remember all that nonsense?

931
00:43:45,129 --> 00:43:46,790
It's always been
the responsibility

932
00:43:46,864 --> 00:43:48,354
of the three leaders
of the families

933
00:43:48,433 --> 00:43:50,492
to watch over the town
and its best interests.

934
00:43:51,336 --> 00:43:55,204
Try to understand, their
intentions were so pure.

935
00:43:55,707 --> 00:43:58,039
Create a community
that wouldn't be subjected

936
00:43:58,109 --> 00:43:59,770
to the horrors
that they lived through.

937
00:44:01,212 --> 00:44:02,440
And it worked for 40 years.

938
00:44:02,513 --> 00:44:04,879
Dual Spires was perfect,
until...

939
00:44:04,949 --> 00:44:07,474
The great sawmill
fire of '58.

940
00:44:16,494 --> 00:44:17,961
It was arson.

941
00:44:18,563 --> 00:44:20,929
A drifter, who had been
in town doing odd jobs.

942
00:44:21,332 --> 00:44:22,890
Eight people burned to death.

943
00:44:24,135 --> 00:44:26,467
After that,
we became insulated.

944
00:44:27,138 --> 00:44:28,969
Looked at all outsiders
as a threat.

945
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,338
Like Paula.
She was afraid.

946
00:44:31,709 --> 00:44:33,973
She thought she was being watched.
Even followed.

947
00:44:34,278 --> 00:44:35,575
She was.

948
00:44:35,647 --> 00:44:38,343
Which is why Michelle and I were
supportive of her decision to leave.

949
00:44:38,816 --> 00:44:39,976
I...

950
00:44:40,652 --> 00:44:43,212
We loved her so much.

951
00:44:43,788 --> 00:44:45,415
We just wanted her
to be happy.

952
00:44:50,428 --> 00:44:52,726
Did Paula ever know
that you were her father?

953
00:44:56,501 --> 00:44:57,729
Yes.

954
00:44:57,802 --> 00:44:59,235
I had to tell her,
in order to get her

955
00:44:59,303 --> 00:45:00,634
to come here
in the first place.

956
00:45:00,705 --> 00:45:02,263
What about your wife?

957
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:04,205
Did she know you had
an affair with her sister?

958
00:45:04,676 --> 00:45:05,700
No.

959
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:07,602
She never will.

960
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:08,771
I think she's
been through enough.

961
00:45:10,782 --> 00:45:14,183
You know, for a town that prides
itself on honesty and do-goodedness,

962
00:45:14,252 --> 00:45:15,981
you have a lot of skeletons
in your closet.

963
00:45:16,054 --> 00:45:18,318
Judge not, that ye
may be judged, Gus.

964
00:45:19,157 --> 00:45:20,954
Although, I must say,
in this case,

965
00:45:21,526 --> 00:45:23,221
it's pretty messed up.

966
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,327
I know who
killed Paula Merral.

967
00:45:34,505 --> 00:45:35,733
Sheriff, you can
put the gun down.

968
00:45:35,807 --> 00:45:37,934
This is Father Westley.
He saved us.

969
00:45:38,042 --> 00:45:39,771
My hair doesn't normally
look like this.

970
00:45:40,445 --> 00:45:42,037
Bless me father,
for I have sinned.

971
00:45:42,847 --> 00:45:44,781
But I'm afraid
I can't put away this gun.

972
00:45:45,316 --> 00:45:47,284
No, I suppose
you can't.

973
00:45:48,019 --> 00:45:49,281
You see,
the other two families

974
00:45:49,353 --> 00:45:51,412
that settled this town
were the Jacksons

975
00:45:51,956 --> 00:45:54,083
and the Goodens,
am I right?

976
00:45:55,159 --> 00:45:57,992
And as its other two
leaders, you panicked

977
00:45:58,362 --> 00:46:01,126
when you caught wind
that the evil Paula

978
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:02,791
was running away
with Randy.

979
00:46:03,234 --> 00:46:04,496
I mean,
without the Cinnamon King,

980
00:46:04,569 --> 00:46:07,094
who would lead
over future generations?

981
00:46:07,538 --> 00:46:09,130
The good doctor
can't conceive.

982
00:46:11,242 --> 00:46:13,107
The Barkers didn't have
a child of their own,

983
00:46:13,177 --> 00:46:15,475
which means Randy is
the only direct descendent

984
00:46:15,546 --> 00:46:18,014
to protect Dual Spires
and your way of life.

985
00:46:18,449 --> 00:46:21,850
Especially now that the
sheriff is dying of cancer.

986
00:46:22,186 --> 00:46:25,314
I know he's hurting,
but he won't talk to me.

987
00:46:25,389 --> 00:46:27,789
The two of you wielded
all the power necessary

988
00:46:27,859 --> 00:46:30,191
to kill Paula and make it
look like an accident.

989
00:46:30,828 --> 00:46:32,227
And you would have
gotten away with it too,

990
00:46:32,296 --> 00:46:34,628
if Maudette hadn't
sent those emails.

991
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:37,966
But even that was nothing a little
rope couldn't take care of.

992
00:46:38,035 --> 00:46:39,195
Isn't that right, sheriff?

993
00:46:39,771 --> 00:46:41,636
You truly are amazing.

994
00:46:42,073 --> 00:46:43,665
But you shouldn't
have come here.

995
00:46:44,275 --> 00:46:45,936
Our business
was not your concern.

996
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:48,478
Your business is murder.

997
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,680
Her death, though tragic,
saves our future.

998
00:46:53,484 --> 00:46:55,509
You killed my little girl.

999
00:46:57,121 --> 00:46:58,520
What about us?

1000
00:46:58,589 --> 00:47:01,149
Honestly, far less tragic.

1001
00:47:01,926 --> 00:47:03,257
We barely know you.

1002
00:47:03,561 --> 00:47:06,826
I'm in my own special category.
Right?

1003
00:47:07,165 --> 00:47:08,359
Really, father?

1004
00:47:09,667 --> 00:47:12,261
Freeze!
Drop it, now.

1005
00:47:14,005 --> 00:47:14,994
How did you find us?

1006
00:47:15,072 --> 00:47:17,302
Oh, miracles happen
every day, Gus.

1007
00:47:17,508 --> 00:47:18,532
This is a miracle?

1008
00:47:18,609 --> 00:47:21,476
No, I called the detectives
before I came to town.

1009
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:23,203
You sly old dog.

1010
00:47:24,382 --> 00:47:26,612
We ran into Jack,
and he led us here.

1011
00:47:27,251 --> 00:47:28,878
They thought
this place was a secret.

1012
00:47:29,253 --> 00:47:31,414
I've photographed every
single inch of this town.

1013
00:47:31,489 --> 00:47:32,820
Ah, good work, son.

1014
00:47:33,991 --> 00:47:35,219
We're over here.

1015
00:47:37,328 --> 00:47:38,659
Oh, Jack.

1016
00:47:39,964 --> 00:47:41,329
Yo!
SHAWN Now, Jack, really...

1017
00:47:41,732 --> 00:47:43,199
It's brighter than the sun.
Enough. Enough.

1018
00:48:05,355 --> 00:48:07,414
It's nice to finally
have some alone time.

1019
00:48:07,491 --> 00:48:08,822
It is.

1020
00:48:08,892 --> 00:48:11,122
Though, you know,
we're not really alone, Shawn.

1021
00:48:12,229 --> 00:48:14,390
You were not lying
about the pie, Burton.

1022
00:48:14,664 --> 00:48:16,256
It's heavenly.
Right?

1023
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:18,028
Now on to Ecclesiastes.

1024
00:48:18,101 --> 00:48:19,568
It's one of my favorites.
Hmm?

1025
00:48:19,703 --> 00:48:22,103
Couldn't blow off a priest,
I'm pretty sure that's a sin.

1026
00:48:22,172 --> 00:48:26,074
It's not so much Gus, and
Father Westley, and Carlton.

1027
00:48:30,213 --> 00:48:32,272
That is a damn fine
cup of cider.

1028
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:35,011
It's the other people.

1029
00:48:36,853 --> 00:48:39,117
Three cinnamon pies, please.

1030
00:49:09,486 --> 00:49:11,010
What do you say we get out of here?
I'm in.
