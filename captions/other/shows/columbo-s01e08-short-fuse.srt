1
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,993
Better than the Borgias.

2
00:03:39,506 --> 00:03:43,239
Time for a little spontaneous
merriment!

3
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:44,072
Junior!

4
00:03:44,172 --> 00:03:49,670
Workers arise! Protest the sale of
your company, your jobs.

5
00:03:51,237 --> 00:03:53,470
Junior, please, come on!

6
00:03:53,803 --> 00:03:58,369
Junior, Junior, please wait.
What is that? Plastic?

7
00:03:58,469 --> 00:03:59,469
Yeah.

8
00:03:59,668 --> 00:04:00,635
You invent it?

9
00:04:00,735 --> 00:04:02,201
Oh, no, I wish I had. But,
I mean,

10
00:04:02,301 --> 00:04:04,535
not that anybody'd cares around
this square organization.

11
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:08,133
Mr.Stanford, Mr.Buckner is waiting.

12
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:13,033
Bye, girls!

13
00:04:16,366 --> 00:04:18,732
Roger, what is the matter with you?

14
00:04:19,232 --> 00:04:22,965
Well, what's wrong? I came right
over the moment you phoned.

15
00:04:23,065 --> 00:04:26,064
I was afraid you'd gone home.
I tried every place in the plant.

16
00:04:26,663 --> 00:04:27,463
Roger.

17
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:32,196
What were you doing in your
darkroom?

18
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:35,995
Now don't you worry. You were
underexposed.

19
00:04:36,095 --> 00:04:39,495
You didn't, you didn't develop
those pictures?

20
00:04:39,828 --> 00:04:41,595
You know, I've been analyzing
this stuff.

21
00:04:41,695 --> 00:04:43,328
Why doesn't our plastics division
ever make...

22
00:04:43,428 --> 00:04:45,160
Get into your uncle.
He is very upset!

23
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,726
Now, wait! What is that stuff doing
here?

24
00:04:47,826 --> 00:04:49,726
Benson dropped it off from the
house.

25
00:04:49,826 --> 00:04:51,959
I'm gonna have someone
take it out to his car.

26
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,458
But he isn't going to Pinewild
until tomorrow morning!

27
00:04:54,592 --> 00:04:56,025
At breakfast, he told Aunt Dory...

28
00:04:56,124 --> 00:04:58,525
So he changed his mind.
Roger, please...

29
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:02,024
No, no, no, wait a minute. Have
you checked to make sure that...

30
00:05:02,123 --> 00:05:03,591
...Benson packed everything
he needed?

31
00:05:03,691 --> 00:05:06,756
I mean the...royal cravats?
The gold toothbrush? That's...

32
00:05:08,022 --> 00:05:11,022
No cigars! Oh, Benson,
you are fired.

33
00:05:11,156 --> 00:05:12,722
And you, Miss Bishop,
you are next!

34
00:05:12,822 --> 00:05:15,522
Do you realize what will happen
when the great D.L. wakes up to...

35
00:05:15,621 --> 00:05:17,421
...find no box of Fidel's finest?

36
00:05:17,521 --> 00:05:18,855
I was just gonna get them.

37
00:05:31,685 --> 00:05:34,984
Will you stop this? Roger, he's
got Quincy in there with him.

38
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,184
Oh, you know, I love that worried
expression on your face.

39
00:05:37,318 --> 00:05:38,450
Now, you just hold... hold it.

40
00:05:38,584 --> 00:05:40,617
Roger, stop this and get in there.

41
00:05:40,817 --> 00:05:42,916
Come on, now, give me a smile.

42
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:45,883
Now, Roger. What do you think?

43
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,148
Smile. Look over here and smile.

44
00:05:52,515 --> 00:05:56,214
Roger, will you put that silly camera down
and tell me now, what do you think?

45
00:05:58,147 --> 00:05:59,746
Oh, I tell you Quincy.

46
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,613
When I was seventeen years old,
I told my aunt not to marry him.

47
00:06:04,346 --> 00:06:06,879
Oh D.L., your syntax is terrible.

48
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:10,378
Listen to this,
I, Roger Stanford the second...

49
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:13,478
Roger, I have a management
meeting, I'd like to wind up.

50
00:06:13,977 --> 00:06:16,610
Who is going to believe this, anyway?
I mean, a statement from me,

51
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,276
approving the sale of a company
that my own father started.

52
00:06:19,376 --> 00:06:21,409
I mean, he'd roll over in his grave.

53
00:06:22,043 --> 00:06:24,842
You know, you didn't read down
the bottom there, the last paragraph.

54
00:06:24,975 --> 00:06:26,309
They'll believe it all right,

55
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:29,808
if you tell them that you've lost
your interest in chemicals,

56
00:06:29,907 --> 00:06:31,807
you don't care about working here
anymore,

57
00:06:31,907 --> 00:06:33,974
and you're going to Europe.

58
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:40,172
Oh!

59
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:43,139
I've got to calm my people down
around here, Roger.

60
00:06:43,538 --> 00:06:46,438
I've got to get rid of this rumor,
this silly fear that...

61
00:06:46,538 --> 00:06:49,337
...the sale of the company is going to
endanger their jobs.

62
00:06:49,437 --> 00:06:52,337
It's not. It's not going to change
anything around here.

63
00:06:52,437 --> 00:06:53,970
Except at the top!

64
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,936
Because besides being President of
Stanford Chemical,

65
00:06:57,036 --> 00:06:58,769
you would also be the big man
in the conglomerate.

66
00:06:58,869 --> 00:06:59,802
Now, wouldn't you?

67
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,902
No, no, it isn't just me, Roger.

68
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:04,135
Yeah, and what about your vice
president, I mean, how long is...

69
00:07:04,235 --> 00:07:06,734
...Logan gonna last when they
find out how he opposed you?

70
00:07:06,935 --> 00:07:10,433
He thinks the sale of this company is
criminal. Me, look, I don't matter.

71
00:07:10,567 --> 00:07:12,667
I didn't inherit enough stock,
but Aunt Dory did!

72
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:14,799
And I tell you,
you haven't persuaded her yet.

73
00:07:15,532 --> 00:07:17,466
She'll go along just as soon as
you do.

74
00:07:17,966 --> 00:07:22,132
If she hadn't bent over backwards
to spoil you and pamper you,

75
00:07:22,231 --> 00:07:24,231
when she took you in as a kid.

76
00:07:25,231 --> 00:07:27,564
Oh, Quincy. Isn't he amusing?

77
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,096
He married my aunt but he couldn't
marry her stock, what's the matter?

78
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,596
Why can't you get her to give
you control?

79
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:36,496
It's almost six o'clock, Mr.Buckner.

80
00:07:36,595 --> 00:07:38,562
The roads will be wet and
we've got a long drive.

81
00:07:38,662 --> 00:07:40,161
Yes, let's get on with it, Quin.

82
00:07:42,627 --> 00:07:44,227
I thought there'd be something else.

83
00:07:44,327 --> 00:07:45,327
Yes, there is.

84
00:07:45,927 --> 00:07:50,526
Roger, I've been very patient with you
down through these past several years.

85
00:07:50,626 --> 00:07:53,159
All the trouble you've caused here
in this company.

86
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:56,792
Not to mention the half a million
dollars you cost us...

87
00:07:56,891 --> 00:08:00,058
...by fooling around in something
you called research.

88
00:08:01,157 --> 00:08:02,558
That was kind of you.

89
00:08:02,658 --> 00:08:04,824
But enough is enough.

90
00:08:05,423 --> 00:08:06,457
Quincy.

91
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,689
Item: I found the place where you
gamble in Vegas.

92
00:08:11,322 --> 00:08:12,988
This is a letter from
a handwriting expert...

93
00:08:13,088 --> 00:08:15,389
...that'll swear you forged
your aunt's signature.

94
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:21,921
Oh D.L., now this,
it's really beneath you.

95
00:08:23,454 --> 00:08:24,353
Go on, Quin.

96
00:08:25,287 --> 00:08:28,286
Item: The drug thing in college.

97
00:08:30,286 --> 00:08:33,652
Item: The mess in Acapulco and...

98
00:08:34,151 --> 00:08:36,851
this is a photostat of
that car-theft report.

99
00:08:40,017 --> 00:08:45,183
Oh Quincy, I tell you, you are
superb. You really are, you know,

100
00:08:45,283 --> 00:08:48,882
You are the best combination
chauffeur and private detective...

101
00:08:48,982 --> 00:08:50,948
...in the business.
Yeah, but what is the matter?

102
00:08:51,048 --> 00:08:53,948
Now tell me, why can't he get
something for you on Logan...

103
00:08:54,048 --> 00:08:55,648
...and get rid of all your opposition?

104
00:08:55,781 --> 00:08:58,580
Tell me, now, Quincy,
what is he, what's wrong?

105
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,413
Your wiretapping. It's not working?

106
00:09:01,513 --> 00:09:04,313
Why can't you frame
a harmless old bachelor?

107
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,412
Yes, Valerie?

108
00:09:07,512 --> 00:09:10,912
Excuse me, Mr.Buckner.
Mr.Logan and the others are here.

109
00:09:11,078 --> 00:09:12,111
Thank you.

110
00:09:14,044 --> 00:09:15,410
It's all here, Roger.

111
00:09:16,444 --> 00:09:18,943
Tomorrow, some of the attorneys
from the conglomerate...

112
00:09:19,043 --> 00:09:21,443
...are coming up to meet with me
at the cabin at Pinewild...

113
00:09:21,543 --> 00:09:23,109
...to discuss the terms of the sale.

114
00:09:23,242 --> 00:09:26,508
But tonight, I want you to
go see your Aunt Dory.

115
00:09:26,675 --> 00:09:30,442
Tell her you don't care about working
here anymore, you're quitting.

116
00:09:30,674 --> 00:09:33,507
And tomorrow, you release
that statement to the press.

117
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,540
Otherwise, I'm afraid I'll...
I'll have to show her all this.

118
00:09:44,938 --> 00:09:46,704
You really would, wouldn't you?

119
00:09:47,604 --> 00:09:48,671
I would.

120
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,104
You know, D.L.?
I have been well aware of...

121
00:09:54,203 --> 00:09:57,836
...what you and Quincy have been up to
the last couple of months and...

122
00:09:59,469 --> 00:10:02,135
seeing you've got my back up
against the wall,

123
00:10:03,968 --> 00:10:04,935
You win.

124
00:10:06,368 --> 00:10:07,301
Hmm?

125
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:13,133
You're going to give up this easily?

126
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:17,199
I just know when I'm outclassed.

127
00:10:19,466 --> 00:10:20,732
I'll sign it tonight.

128
00:10:21,365 --> 00:10:25,398
Anyway, I mean,
who wants a chemical company?

129
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,564
Ah, gentlemen.

130
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,730
- Hello, Roger!
- Hello, Junior!

131
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:33,996
Oh, and good night, Uncle David!

132
00:10:38,862 --> 00:10:39,828
Well?

133
00:10:41,661 --> 00:10:46,361
Don't worry. They haven't set
Quincy onto you, yet.

134
00:10:47,027 --> 00:10:50,226
If only you didn't feel it necessary
to play the fool so much.

135
00:10:51,427 --> 00:10:52,859
What was it this time?

136
00:10:53,226 --> 00:10:58,259
Oh, it's nothing. Really nothing,
it's nothing at all. Except...

137
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:03,724
...we have decided that it is time
for people to stop calling me...

138
00:11:03,824 --> 00:11:05,424
..."Junior" around here.

139
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,723
Roger, shall we see each other later?

140
00:11:07,856 --> 00:11:08,689
Why not?

141
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:12,556
I've got this little job to do first,
but it shouldn't take very long.

142
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,319
Wasting your time, Fergy,
it's gonna rain.

143
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,852
Good night, Junior.

144
00:11:29,786 --> 00:11:31,685
Oh, oh, Fergy, I am sorry,

145
00:11:31,786 --> 00:11:33,951
I forgot to tell you this morning,
but could you look under my hood.

146
00:11:34,051 --> 00:11:36,085
I think I've got a loose plug wire
or something.

147
00:11:36,185 --> 00:11:37,085
Yeah.

148
00:11:37,484 --> 00:11:38,317
Thanks.

149
00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:46,417
Oh, you have missed a spot here,
Fergy. My uncle will not like that.

150
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,372
You're crazy, Junior.
The wiring's okay.

151
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:46,072
Hose clamp needs tightening a little,
that's all.

152
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:49,772
It does? How did that get loose?

153
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:55,903
Oh, don't worry, Fergy.
I don't want you to miss your nickel tip.

154
00:19:28,364 --> 00:19:29,031
Oh Sir?

155
00:19:31,464 --> 00:19:32,464
Who are you?

156
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,463
Is that you?

157
00:19:34,563 --> 00:19:37,029
Your aunt said it sounded like
a car down here in the drive.

158
00:19:37,263 --> 00:19:39,196
I mean, you're Mr.Stanford,
aren't you?

159
00:19:39,296 --> 00:19:41,729
Well, obviously.
And who might you be?

160
00:19:41,829 --> 00:19:46,895
Oh, I'm sorry. Columbo...
Lieutenant Columbo. I'm from the police.

161
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,294
The police?

162
00:19:49,328 --> 00:19:51,960
You mean, that old heap out there
is yours?

163
00:19:52,193 --> 00:19:55,026
Oh, yeah. It needs a coat of paint,
doesn't it?

164
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,192
Anyway, Mrs.Buckner,
she asked me to get you quick.

165
00:19:58,292 --> 00:20:00,392
There are no servants up there
in the house.

166
00:20:00,591 --> 00:20:04,191
She was afraid you were gonna go
straight onto your place or something.

167
00:20:04,491 --> 00:20:05,757
Why? What's wrong?

168
00:20:05,857 --> 00:20:09,023
Oh, nothing that we know about
so far, but she's very upset.

169
00:20:09,123 --> 00:20:13,423
So I suggest that you close your door
and come right away.

170
00:20:13,523 --> 00:20:16,588
My...? Oh, no, I don't live here.

171
00:20:16,689 --> 00:20:19,789
I live in a guest cottage out back,
that's what she meant.

172
00:20:20,388 --> 00:20:22,121
This is where the chauffeur lives.
See,

173
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:26,254
I was on my way home tonight.
I thought I saw his door open.

174
00:20:26,354 --> 00:20:28,620
You did? The chauffeur?

175
00:20:28,953 --> 00:20:31,687
You mean Mr.Quincy? The fellow who
was driving Mr.Buckner tonight?

176
00:20:32,219 --> 00:20:33,886
I'd better look in here.

177
00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:38,018
Couldn't you find the light?

178
00:20:38,118 --> 00:20:39,384
Well, of course, I did.

179
00:20:39,484 --> 00:20:41,718
I mean, that's how I found out
nobody was home.

180
00:20:44,351 --> 00:20:46,317
Well, everything seems to be
in order.

181
00:20:47,783 --> 00:20:49,983
Maybe somebody's been
tampering with this lock.

182
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:54,615
Lieutenant, just what are you
doing here now? What has happened?

183
00:20:55,282 --> 00:20:58,548
Mr.Buckner, he sort of disappeared.

184
00:20:58,814 --> 00:21:02,347
He may have been attacked somewhere.
They warned him, didn't they?

185
00:21:02,447 --> 00:21:05,013
They threw that awful stenchbomb
on our lawn yesterday.

186
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,546
Yes, your aunt says there's been
some kind of trouble out there...

187
00:21:07,646 --> 00:21:09,212
...at Stanford Chemical.

188
00:21:09,313 --> 00:21:11,412
Well, he has been threatened.

189
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,645
I know there have been
those anonymous phone calls.

190
00:21:14,078 --> 00:21:15,445
But those are from hotheads.

191
00:21:15,744 --> 00:21:18,277
Hotheads?
What are they hot about?

192
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:21,677
He's been negotiating with
the conglomerate, dickering to sell.

193
00:21:22,144 --> 00:21:24,576
Now, a lot of the old retainers
do not like this.

194
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:29,842
You might say there has been
an excess of corporate bad feeling.

195
00:21:29,942 --> 00:21:32,641
I see. How did you feel about this,
ma'am?

196
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:34,408
Did you side with your husband
on this?

197
00:21:34,508 --> 00:21:36,374
I was in the process of
making up my mind,

198
00:21:36,474 --> 00:21:38,740
which is beside the point right now.

199
00:21:38,874 --> 00:21:41,674
David is missing.
That's the only issue.

200
00:21:41,773 --> 00:21:43,673
Yes, it certainly is, ma'am.

201
00:21:43,773 --> 00:21:45,806
Tell me, do you know anything about
his whereabouts tonight?

202
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:49,438
He left the plant around seven,
he was going to Pinewild.

203
00:21:49,705 --> 00:21:50,405
Pine...?

204
00:21:51,104 --> 00:21:51,937
...wild.

205
00:21:52,138 --> 00:21:54,604
Pinewild. I'm not familiar with that...

206
00:21:55,238 --> 00:21:59,103
We have a place up there.
He should have arrived hours ago.

207
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,436
The caretaker hasn't heard anything
and...

208
00:22:01,536 --> 00:22:03,869
I called the sheriff's mountain office.

209
00:22:04,036 --> 00:22:05,403
They can't find him.

210
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:10,601
Oh, maybe they got hungry. Maybe
they stopped off somewhere for a drink.

211
00:22:10,701 --> 00:22:14,467
Rog, you know that isn't so. He told
Benson he'd have supper up there.

212
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,200
You know how awful those roads are.

213
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,300
If he'd only taken the aerial tram
and had the caretaker meet him...

214
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,132
...at the top as I do.
It's so much safer, faster.

215
00:22:24,265 --> 00:22:25,931
Well, ma'am,
I checked with Highway Patrol.

216
00:22:26,032 --> 00:22:28,765
And there's no report of any
accidents on those roads.

217
00:22:29,398 --> 00:22:30,864
There, you see?

218
00:22:31,097 --> 00:22:32,398
Oh...

219
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:36,463
Oh, Lieutenant,
I think we owe you a drink.

220
00:22:37,196 --> 00:22:39,396
Aunt Dory, when he was out of town
last week,

221
00:22:39,496 --> 00:22:40,696
you didn't even notice he was gone.

222
00:22:40,796 --> 00:22:43,362
Now, what made you call the police
tonight of all nights?

223
00:22:44,361 --> 00:22:45,461
So do you want a drink?

224
00:22:46,428 --> 00:22:48,661
Roger, I called the Commissioner
of Police.

225
00:22:48,894 --> 00:22:51,661
And he said he'd send over
his very best man.

226
00:22:52,926 --> 00:22:54,160
Is that a fact?

227
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:57,059
Well, my wife, she says
I'm second best but...

228
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:00,425
she claims there are 80 fellas
tied for first.

229
00:23:00,525 --> 00:23:05,292
At any rate, I don't mind
being sent out on a false alarm.

230
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:07,957
I just hope that this is one.

231
00:23:08,224 --> 00:23:14,656
Because she had a right to call.
You see, she got this message.

232
00:23:15,123 --> 00:23:16,722
Here, I'll show you.

233
00:23:18,888 --> 00:23:19,888
Message?

234
00:23:20,222 --> 00:23:23,388
Yes, he called just before I got home
from the opera board meeting.

235
00:23:23,655 --> 00:23:25,388
That was at seven-thirty.

236
00:23:34,286 --> 00:23:37,718
Oh, maybe you better operate this
because I'm not sure how it...

237
00:23:37,818 --> 00:23:39,151
All right, Lieutenant.

238
00:23:40,551 --> 00:23:42,485
You can tell that
he's calling from a car.

239
00:23:42,584 --> 00:23:44,684
You can hear it on the recording.

240
00:23:48,816 --> 00:23:52,349
<i>There's no one answering at the moment.
This is a recording device.</i>

241
00:23:52,449 --> 00:23:54,016
<i>Would you care to leave a message?</i>

242
00:23:54,116 --> 00:23:57,881
<i>Oh, these modern idiotic devices.
She's not home yet.</i>

243
00:23:58,648 --> 00:24:00,714
<i>Quincy, look in the dash there,
will you?</i>

244
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,247
Dash. You hear that?
Dash from the car?

245
00:24:03,581 --> 00:24:05,247
<i>If so, your voice will be recorded,</i>

246
00:24:05,346 --> 00:24:07,747
<i>and the connection won't be broken
until you hang up.</i>

247
00:24:08,712 --> 00:24:10,779
<i>Nope. What's the matter with Benson?</i>

248
00:24:10,912 --> 00:24:13,778
<i>You're sure your cigar case isn't
in your coat pocket?</i>

249
00:24:13,978 --> 00:24:16,012
<i>You may start your message, now.
Thank you.</i>

250
00:24:16,112 --> 00:24:20,011
<i>Yeah, just give me the box.
Thank you.</i>

251
00:24:20,444 --> 00:24:22,577
<i>Hello? Hello darling.</i>

252
00:24:22,744 --> 00:24:25,043
<i>It's me. Hold on just a second.</i>

253
00:24:25,443 --> 00:24:27,409
<i>Want me to pull over and
open that for you?</i>

254
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:29,075
<i>No, it's all right. I got it.</i>

255
00:24:33,908 --> 00:24:36,874
<i>Oh, look, why I'm calling,
I tried to get you earlier today.</i>

256
00:24:36,974 --> 00:24:40,140
<i>But I guess you were in one of those
silly committee meetings or something,</i>

257
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,506
<i>Miss Bishop couldn't get you
from the office either.</i>

258
00:24:42,806 --> 00:24:47,939
<i>But what I was calling about, I'm...
I'm on my way up to the cabin, now.</i>

259
00:24:48,072 --> 00:24:52,438
<i>So, I'll see you tomorrow...
No, Sunday rather, Sunday afternoon...</i>

260
00:24:52,538 --> 00:24:56,870
<i>... or evening sometime. But what
I wanted you to know is that...</i>

261
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:02,436
<i>Roger is gonna come over to see you
tonight. He wants to talk to you...</i>

262
00:25:02,536 --> 00:25:04,602
<i>... about something.
So I just wanted to make sure that...</i>

263
00:25:04,702 --> 00:25:08,168
<i>... you'd be home and
wait up for him, will you?</i>

264
00:25:08,668 --> 00:25:14,434
<i>It's... well, he's made a decision about
something. It might not be exactly what...</i>

265
00:25:14,867 --> 00:25:20,133
<i>... you figured it would be, but to
my way of thinking, it's a wise decision.</i>

266
00:25:21,366 --> 00:25:25,266
<i>So after you talk to him,</i>

267
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:27,531
<i>call me back at the cabin, will you?</i>

268
00:25:27,632 --> 00:25:32,530
<i>Let me know what he decided.
Bye bye for now, darling.</i>

269
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:40,096
Gee, I'm terribly sorry about that.
Here, I've got something in my pocket.

270
00:25:40,196 --> 00:25:41,129
Yeah.

271
00:25:43,096 --> 00:25:46,095
Well, anyway, that's it.
He just hung up.

272
00:25:46,528 --> 00:25:47,527
Yeah, sure.

273
00:25:47,628 --> 00:25:50,227
Roger... you're just as concerned
about him as I am, aren't you?

274
00:25:50,461 --> 00:25:51,261
What?

275
00:25:51,628 --> 00:25:53,394
You seem so upset.

276
00:25:53,793 --> 00:25:56,760
I'm surprised because you don't like him
very much, do you?

277
00:25:57,193 --> 00:26:01,826
Oh, well actually, I've been
growing much fonder of him lately.

278
00:26:02,092 --> 00:26:03,192
Did you call him back?

279
00:26:03,292 --> 00:26:06,224
Yes, I tried to reach him on the car phone.
There was no answer.

280
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,057
Lieutenant, look, if there's
anything you can do, do it.

281
00:26:10,157 --> 00:26:11,990
Yeah, go out there and find him!

282
00:26:12,357 --> 00:26:14,923
Well I can assure you,
I've started all the wheels rolling.

283
00:26:15,023 --> 00:26:16,522
We're doing everything we can.

284
00:26:16,623 --> 00:26:20,888
Now, this area, this Pinewild,
that's out of our bailiwick.

285
00:26:20,989 --> 00:26:24,988
But we... we've got the Sheriff's office
and the Highway Patrol on it.

286
00:26:25,088 --> 00:26:27,621
And I'm gonna stay after them,
don't you worry, Mrs.Buckner.

287
00:26:27,721 --> 00:26:28,554
Fine.

288
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,586
I mean, we're gonna find him.

289
00:26:30,686 --> 00:26:31,686
Thank you, Lieutenant.

290
00:26:31,786 --> 00:26:32,453
Good night.

291
00:26:32,553 --> 00:26:33,319
Good night.

292
00:26:36,885 --> 00:26:40,585
I hope you're right, Lieutenant.
My uncle is a very important man.

293
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:43,151
Oh, I'm aware of that, sir.
Listen, by the way,

294
00:26:43,251 --> 00:26:46,084
what about your parents, Mr.Stanford?
Are they both alive?

295
00:26:46,384 --> 00:26:49,783
Oh, no, they died when I was in college.
It was a freak explosion at the plant.

296
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:52,983
Aunt Dory became my guardian
and then she married David.

297
00:26:53,482 --> 00:26:55,115
Were there any other children?

298
00:26:55,182 --> 00:26:56,148
No.

299
00:26:56,682 --> 00:26:58,815
Aunt Dory is your father's sister?

300
00:26:58,982 --> 00:26:59,848
Yes.

301
00:27:00,381 --> 00:27:02,981
And on your father's side,
were there other aunts and uncles?

302
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,047
Tell me, Lieutenant,

303
00:27:05,147 --> 00:27:08,713
why are you so fascinated
with my family history?

304
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:14,279
Oh, no, it's just that... trying to get
things straightened out in my mind.

305
00:27:14,745 --> 00:27:18,345
In case you're wondering...
if anything does happen to David,

306
00:27:18,445 --> 00:27:20,611
his money goes to her, not me.

307
00:27:20,711 --> 00:27:23,244
Oh, I wasn't thinking about that at all.
Oh, no.

308
00:27:23,344 --> 00:27:26,810
Listen, by the way, I didn't wanna
mention this to your aunt inside,

309
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:30,575
but... is it possible that
Mr.Buckner might have wanted...

310
00:27:30,675 --> 00:27:33,041
...to stop someplace
without telling anybody?

311
00:27:33,141 --> 00:27:35,408
You know, visit somebody in private?

312
00:27:37,441 --> 00:27:39,974
I don't think that's any of your business,
Lieutenant.

313
00:27:40,074 --> 00:27:41,873
It certainly is none of mine.

314
00:27:43,074 --> 00:27:46,240
Oh, no. Oh, no, sorry.

315
00:27:47,139 --> 00:27:48,139
Good night.

316
00:27:48,305 --> 00:27:49,272
Good night.

317
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:52,938
Is your watch broken?

318
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:54,204
Hmm?

319
00:27:54,671 --> 00:27:55,605
Your watch?

320
00:27:57,238 --> 00:27:58,670
My watch broken?

321
00:28:00,403 --> 00:28:01,303
No, why?

322
00:28:01,637 --> 00:28:03,237
Oh, it's nothing important.
It's just that...

323
00:28:03,337 --> 00:28:05,269
...inside I noticed
you kept looking at it.

324
00:28:08,069 --> 00:28:12,535
You know, Lieutenant,
people do look at their watches.

325
00:28:12,934 --> 00:28:15,834
Yes, they certainly do. Sorry.
Good night.

326
00:28:24,433 --> 00:28:25,366
Rog.

327
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:31,397
What did you want to talk to me
about tonight?

328
00:28:31,631 --> 00:28:33,064
What did David mean?

329
00:28:33,231 --> 00:28:35,830
Oh, that was nothing. Nothing at all.

330
00:28:36,164 --> 00:28:39,430
I had this idea I might like to work
in the legal department for a while.

331
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,729
David said it was fine.
I start there Monday.

332
00:28:43,063 --> 00:28:45,962
Oh, life would be so simple
if you two would just get along.

333
00:28:46,494 --> 00:28:47,761
We're going to.

334
00:28:53,393 --> 00:28:55,126
Where is he, Roger?

335
00:28:56,594 --> 00:29:00,292
If he'd only listened to me.
If he'd only taken the tram.

336
00:29:00,959 --> 00:29:04,558
He's going to be fine.
Just fine, sweetheart.

337
00:29:06,358 --> 00:29:08,291
Some view, huh, Lieutenant?

338
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:16,690
All the way to the top.
8,600 feet above sea level.

339
00:29:17,855 --> 00:29:19,956
It's only a 15-minute ride.

340
00:29:21,922 --> 00:29:25,788
Look down there.
About a 2,000-foot drop.

341
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,054
Over here.

342
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:34,919
The only way to scale that rock,
you have to be a mountain goat.

343
00:29:35,586 --> 00:29:38,152
We had to use helicopters
to build this thing.

344
00:29:41,484 --> 00:29:44,284
Don't worry.
This tram is absolutely safe.

345
00:29:44,518 --> 00:29:47,483
Designed to last.
Never had an accident.

346
00:29:48,283 --> 00:29:50,217
Just sit back and enjoy the ride.

347
00:30:57,504 --> 00:30:59,370
Sure nice view, isn't it?

348
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:03,037
- Yes, it is.
- That's exactly what our problem is.

349
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:07,902
See, early this morning
the sheriff's found a shiny bumper.

350
00:31:09,136 --> 00:31:11,535
At the base of the cliff.
Now, here we are.

351
00:31:12,035 --> 00:31:14,701
It's just about a half hour or so
down the road.

352
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:18,401
Down, yes. Well, that'll be good.

353
00:32:15,557 --> 00:32:17,390
What is that? Quincy the chauffeur?

354
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:20,722
Yeah. We spotted Buckner's body
further down there.

355
00:32:20,822 --> 00:32:23,988
You can barely see a man working
his way towards it.

356
00:32:24,088 --> 00:32:28,987
Now, step out here, on this ledge,
you get a better view.

357
00:32:29,388 --> 00:32:30,720
Right over there.

358
00:32:31,087 --> 00:32:33,853
Thank you very much.
That won't be necessary. Thank you.

359
00:32:33,986 --> 00:32:35,253
Okay.

360
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,652
As you can see, there's no guardrail,
the roads were slick last night.

361
00:32:40,685 --> 00:32:42,552
Now, this stuff here looks burned.

362
00:32:42,951 --> 00:32:47,250
The bodies are charred. There's debris
scattered over thousands of feet.

363
00:32:47,918 --> 00:32:49,117
We're getting more climbers.

364
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,783
I'll keep you posted on
everything we... we find.

365
00:32:53,416 --> 00:32:54,116
Look here.

366
00:32:56,582 --> 00:32:57,549
Glass.

367
00:32:57,949 --> 00:33:02,848
Yeah, scattered up and down the road,
all over.

368
00:33:03,447 --> 00:33:06,247
Now we found
the chauffeur's cap intact.

369
00:33:06,514 --> 00:33:09,547
About 200 yards clear off to one side
down there.

370
00:33:10,213 --> 00:33:12,746
Well, you know,
sometimes a gas tank explodes.

371
00:33:13,313 --> 00:33:14,445
Well, yeah.

372
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:20,444
Maybe the car skidded and
smacked that rock and the gas tank blew.

373
00:33:21,211 --> 00:33:23,411
Or maybe
something inside the car blew.

374
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:28,443
Exactly.
And since they're just out from LA,

375
00:33:28,543 --> 00:33:32,808
well, I guess in a way it's sort of
your jurisdiction, Lieutenant.

376
00:33:33,376 --> 00:33:35,441
Or at least your problem.

377
00:33:37,941 --> 00:33:41,607
The possibility of murder?
But that's ridiculous.

378
00:33:42,073 --> 00:33:46,806
What difference does it make?
Dead is... is dead, isn't it?

379
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:52,372
Now this talk of the fact that
it is not an accident?

380
00:33:52,672 --> 00:33:55,704
Well, the Lieutenant was here
again today and he...

381
00:33:56,038 --> 00:33:58,504
He said that
they always have to investigate.

382
00:33:58,604 --> 00:34:02,104
It's probably just routine, he... he didn't
want to bother me too much, I guess.

383
00:34:02,904 --> 00:34:05,270
Anyway, he's...
he's gone looking for Roger.

384
00:34:06,736 --> 00:34:10,902
Oh, did I...
oh, did I tell you that...

385
00:34:11,035 --> 00:34:14,301
...David had decided to put Roger
in the legal department?

386
00:34:15,334 --> 00:34:18,967
Did he?
Well, that is something of a switch.

387
00:34:19,567 --> 00:34:21,933
Roger and I have become friendly.

388
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,766
I know he's made mistakes
in the past, but,

389
00:34:24,866 --> 00:34:26,932
I think he's coming along very well.

390
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:31,632
And I... I could never understand
why David didn't like him better.

391
00:34:31,964 --> 00:34:34,231
Of course, I never understood Roger
too well myself.

392
00:34:34,831 --> 00:34:39,796
But I... I've tried to do the best
I could for him, and he is a Stanford.

393
00:34:40,796 --> 00:34:44,529
Somehow I always thought
he might be in charge some day.

394
00:34:50,162 --> 00:34:55,227
Everett... you, you don't think
David was murdered, do you?

395
00:34:56,827 --> 00:35:03,659
Oh, of course not. Now... Look,
you just let me handle everything.

396
00:35:04,692 --> 00:35:07,791
We're not even going to talk about
business for a while yet.

397
00:35:08,092 --> 00:35:11,424
I'll take care of it all.
Newspapers, arrangements...

398
00:35:11,525 --> 00:35:15,756
I know it's a dreadful thing to say,
but I'm so glad you're next in line.

399
00:35:17,223 --> 00:35:19,189
I need someone I can trust.

400
00:35:19,656 --> 00:35:21,122
You just leave everything to me.

401
00:35:22,022 --> 00:35:25,788
And if either you or Roger have
any problems with the police,

402
00:35:26,888 --> 00:35:27,821
you let me know.

403
00:36:21,411 --> 00:36:23,744
You do get around, don't you,
Lieutenant?

404
00:36:31,143 --> 00:36:34,076
I was just waiting for you when
I came here...

405
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:36,609
you know, to look into
the darkroom and...

406
00:36:38,142 --> 00:36:40,674
What are you doing, Lieutenant?
Looking for secret weapons?

407
00:36:42,274 --> 00:36:44,874
Secret weapons? No.
What is this? Kid's stuff?

408
00:36:46,273 --> 00:36:47,973
Oh, hey, Lieutenant!

409
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:51,839
Lieutenant, I...
I was talking to my aunt.

410
00:36:52,339 --> 00:36:56,872
And she said that you think that
maybe somebody killed my uncle.

411
00:36:57,204 --> 00:37:02,071
She said that there was something
about the accident. I don't know.

412
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:05,170
Oh, no, we don't know anything
for sure, just yet.

413
00:37:05,337 --> 00:37:10,436
Oh, no, it's just that... You know,
that's a wonderful darkroom.

414
00:37:10,735 --> 00:37:13,835
Imagine having something like that
right next to your own office!

415
00:37:13,935 --> 00:37:14,834
Yeah!

416
00:37:14,934 --> 00:37:16,001
Wonderful.

417
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:19,033
You know, my wife's kid brother,
he's a nut on photography, too.

418
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,334
Wonderful hobby.

419
00:37:20,601 --> 00:37:24,133
You know, Lieutenant.
I also work on inventions in there.

420
00:37:24,233 --> 00:37:28,599
And you were very lucky... that you
didn't knock over a bottle of acid,

421
00:37:28,932 --> 00:37:33,798
or some cyanide crystals,
or nitroglycerin.

422
00:37:33,898 --> 00:37:36,164
Oh, don't tell me anymore.
I'll have a heart attack.

423
00:37:36,664 --> 00:37:38,964
But you really know that stuff,
don't you?

424
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,063
I noticed that medal you wear
around your neck,

425
00:37:41,163 --> 00:37:43,330
that's an honor society medal,
isn't it?

426
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,562
Oh, it's a National Science
Fraternity.

427
00:37:45,762 --> 00:37:48,562
I had my Ph.D. in chemistry
before I was 21.

428
00:37:48,661 --> 00:37:52,061
But that's before my M.B.A.
and lawyer.

429
00:37:52,328 --> 00:37:53,994
You don't say...

430
00:37:54,428 --> 00:37:57,460
You know, I knew you'd be the one
that could help me.

431
00:37:57,926 --> 00:37:59,227
Would you come?

432
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,659
Now, you see,
my problem with chemistry,

433
00:38:02,759 --> 00:38:05,126
that started way back in high school.

434
00:38:06,658 --> 00:38:09,991
'Cause in my junior year, I...
I had to get a better grade.

435
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:13,624
So I said
"the heck with this chemistry stuff,"

436
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:15,790
"I'll take another year of woodshop."

437
00:38:16,957 --> 00:38:17,923
You know.

438
00:38:18,356 --> 00:38:21,755
You just build a bird house, and if
you paint it red, you get an "A".

439
00:38:23,189 --> 00:38:27,422
So that's what I did. Because
that chemistry stuff, it's just too hard.

440
00:38:27,621 --> 00:38:28,888
You follow my meaning?

441
00:38:28,988 --> 00:38:30,087
Uh... so?

442
00:38:30,187 --> 00:38:32,887
Oh well, you see the fellows
over at our lab,

443
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,553
they tell me that
you can make all sorts of...

444
00:38:36,819 --> 00:38:39,319
...trigger devices that don't
use any powder.

445
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:45,718
They're sort of like explosive
fire things, maybe. Is that true?

446
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:51,750
Oh, so you think
someone put a bomb in his car?

447
00:38:52,183 --> 00:38:54,616
Well, you know there could have
been an explosion,

448
00:38:54,716 --> 00:38:56,649
before they went of the cliff.

449
00:38:56,749 --> 00:38:57,516
Ah...

450
00:38:57,749 --> 00:39:00,216
You see now, if that's the case,

451
00:39:00,482 --> 00:39:02,315
then we got a whole different
kind of...

452
00:39:02,415 --> 00:39:03,181
Lieutenant...

453
00:39:03,281 --> 00:39:04,115
You see what I mean?

454
00:39:04,215 --> 00:39:08,747
Lieutenant, I... I would not
light that cigar now unless you...

455
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,646
...wish to witness an explosion
right now.

456
00:39:12,313 --> 00:39:15,779
Oh... yeah, right. I'm sorry.
No, I won't light it.

457
00:39:15,879 --> 00:39:18,645
Okay, and for your information,
Lieutenant,

458
00:39:19,045 --> 00:39:23,011
there are 30 Ph.D. 's in this plant,

459
00:39:23,644 --> 00:39:26,177
and over 60 qualified chemists.

460
00:39:26,277 --> 00:39:30,510
Yes, there're 10 private experiment
rooms just like mine back there.

461
00:39:32,442 --> 00:39:36,609
And that is not even to mention
the main laboratory building,

462
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:40,041
right over there, where 2,000
more employees...

463
00:39:40,141 --> 00:39:41,874
...toil away like merry little gnomes.

464
00:39:41,941 --> 00:39:44,907
You don't think that all of these people
wanted to kill Mr.Buckner, do you?

465
00:39:45,173 --> 00:39:46,540
I have no idea.

466
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,639
But a large corporation is like
a jungle, Lieutenant, to coin a phrase.

467
00:39:50,739 --> 00:39:54,106
I can't tell you how many executives
there are in our ivory tower...

468
00:39:54,972 --> 00:39:59,004
...who would commit felonious assault
just for the key to a private washroom.

469
00:40:00,238 --> 00:40:03,471
That's not even to mention
the ones who're very unhappy,

470
00:40:03,571 --> 00:40:05,170
because my uncle wished to sell.

471
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:08,203
Yeah, you know, like those malcontents
who kept threatening him.

472
00:40:09,036 --> 00:40:11,669
Well, you know, somehow,

473
00:40:11,769 --> 00:40:14,102
we just can't get a handle
on those threats.

474
00:40:14,868 --> 00:40:18,900
I mean like that stinkbomb,
the boys we sent to check it out,

475
00:40:19,134 --> 00:40:22,667
they say nobody even saw a car
in your neighborhood during that time.

476
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:24,933
Well, that is unfortunate.

477
00:40:25,033 --> 00:40:28,466
However, Lieutenant, I witnessed
one of those phone calls myself.

478
00:40:28,566 --> 00:40:29,265
You did?

479
00:40:29,365 --> 00:40:30,065
Yes.

480
00:40:31,932 --> 00:40:33,598
Well, never mind about that.

481
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:36,298
I'll get somebody else
to check it out, okay?

482
00:40:36,598 --> 00:40:37,364
Yeah.

483
00:40:37,564 --> 00:40:40,630
Because I have my own personal lead
in this case.

484
00:40:41,263 --> 00:40:42,130
You have?

485
00:40:43,363 --> 00:40:47,362
Do you remember that recorded
telephone message on your aunt's phone?

486
00:40:47,895 --> 00:40:48,528
Yeah.

487
00:40:48,762 --> 00:40:51,462
Well, I've been listening to that
over and over again.

488
00:40:52,828 --> 00:40:54,527
It's all right in there.

489
00:40:56,993 --> 00:40:58,494
And I'll tell you what.

490
00:40:58,993 --> 00:41:00,259
Good cigar.

491
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:04,293
This is one area that I do know.

492
00:41:04,692 --> 00:41:06,192
His cigars?

493
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:09,758
Yes, Benson told me that he dropped off
Mr.Buckner's suitcase here...

494
00:41:09,858 --> 00:41:12,558
...at six o'clock,
but no box of cigars.

495
00:41:13,057 --> 00:41:16,091
He said that you told him that
you were gonna take care of that.

496
00:41:17,024 --> 00:41:21,456
Yes. Yea...
Yeah, I, I keep a supply right here.

497
00:41:25,122 --> 00:41:26,488
Go on, Miss Bishop.

498
00:41:27,788 --> 00:41:29,221
What's the matter?

499
00:41:29,755 --> 00:41:33,620
Well, it's just funny your asking
about cigars, that's all.

500
00:41:33,754 --> 00:41:37,220
You see, Mr.Buckner had
a little pocket cigar case.

501
00:41:37,419 --> 00:41:38,087
Here!

502
00:41:38,187 --> 00:41:38,853
What?

503
00:41:39,087 --> 00:41:40,352
Don't touch that!

504
00:41:40,586 --> 00:41:43,019
But why not?
The cleaning lady just gave it to me.

505
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,585
She said she found it
underneath my desk.

506
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:49,185
It must've been in Mr.Buckner's overcoat,
that's where he always kept it,

507
00:41:49,451 --> 00:41:52,983
And you see, Benson put the overcoat
on the suitcase and...

508
00:41:53,516 --> 00:41:56,916
it must have fallen out, that's all.
I guess I just didn't notice it.

509
00:42:00,649 --> 00:42:02,315
What's the matter, Lieutenant?

510
00:42:02,449 --> 00:42:04,282
Did you think someone had stolen it?

511
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:07,281
Well it did seem like
a kind of a coincidence.

512
00:42:07,414 --> 00:42:10,281
On that telephone tape,
you could just barely hear...

513
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,913
...cigar case missing,
no cigars in the dash.

514
00:42:14,513 --> 00:42:20,179
Oh, so you thought that someone
wanted him to open a box of cigars,

515
00:42:20,279 --> 00:42:22,545
while he was still in the car,
I suppose.

516
00:42:22,745 --> 00:42:23,944
Well, it was a possibility.

517
00:42:24,044 --> 00:42:26,877
Lieutenant, what's this all about? I mean,
why are you so interested in cigars?

518
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:30,810
Oh, I'm terribly sorry. It's just that
we have to check out everything.

519
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:34,009
I know how badly you must feel
at this point. Forgive me.

520
00:42:34,309 --> 00:42:37,076
Listen, by the way, Mrs.Buckner said
she tried to reach you that night.

521
00:42:37,176 --> 00:42:39,442
She thought you'd be working late
here in the office, but...

522
00:42:39,542 --> 00:42:45,340
Oh, no... no, you see, my mother was
expecting me to work late,

523
00:42:45,441 --> 00:42:48,807
and I knew she'd be going to bed early,
so I went to a movie.

524
00:42:49,206 --> 00:42:53,405
Lieutenant. Lieutenant, you have
not answered the lady's question.

525
00:42:53,505 --> 00:42:55,405
Now, will you tell her the truth?

526
00:42:58,272 --> 00:43:02,171
Miss Bishop, the Lieutenant is
from Homicide and obviously...

527
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:05,837
...he is under the impression that
the accident was caused by...

528
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:07,769
...an exploding cigar.

529
00:43:08,869 --> 00:43:09,569
What?

530
00:43:09,669 --> 00:43:14,469
Well, you see, Lieutenant, Miss Bishop
got the box of cigars from here.

531
00:43:14,835 --> 00:43:19,101
Yeah, I saw her, and she put them
over there on the suitcase.

532
00:43:19,568 --> 00:43:22,233
Yeah, here, try one yourself.

533
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,232
Wow, I never saw cigars
quite like this before.

534
00:43:27,733 --> 00:43:29,599
Are all the boxes the same?

535
00:43:29,699 --> 00:43:31,565
Uh, listen, don't you tell Customs.

536
00:43:31,665 --> 00:43:33,765
They're from Cuba.
You know, that's a dollar a pop.

537
00:43:33,865 --> 00:43:35,065
Now wait just a minute.

538
00:43:35,298 --> 00:43:38,731
Are you suggesting that something was
wrong with one of those cigar boxes?

539
00:43:38,831 --> 00:43:42,197
Oh, of course not.
The Lieutenant is just simply wrong.

540
00:43:43,164 --> 00:43:46,029
You see, if there was an explosive
in that car,

541
00:43:46,129 --> 00:43:48,562
it would have to have been placed
somewhere else.

542
00:43:49,096 --> 00:43:51,228
No, no, I'm afraid not.

543
00:43:51,728 --> 00:43:55,227
No. You see, on the way over here,
I bumped into a very nice old fella...

544
00:43:55,361 --> 00:43:57,927
...that works in one of your
service stations. His name's Ferguson.

545
00:43:58,261 --> 00:44:00,660
And he cleaned that car
before they left.

546
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:04,126
And he told me there was nothing else
in that car except a suitcase,

547
00:44:04,226 --> 00:44:06,526
a coat, and a box of cigars.

548
00:44:06,925 --> 00:44:09,125
And the old boy who carried
everything down,

549
00:44:09,225 --> 00:44:10,958
he said the same thing.

550
00:44:11,491 --> 00:44:16,991
All right, then. Then, the explosive
must have been in the cigar box.

551
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:18,689
Yeah, I'll grant you that,
Lieutenant, yes.

552
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:23,423
And if somebody tampered with it,
or switched it...

553
00:44:23,623 --> 00:44:25,423
that would have had to have happened
here, right?

554
00:44:27,822 --> 00:44:33,754
Okay, Miss Bishop. Will you tell me
how long did D.L. 's suitcase...

555
00:44:33,854 --> 00:44:37,686
...sit there in the middle of this floor,
with people coming and going?

556
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:43,318
Oh, 20... 30 minutes.

557
00:44:43,452 --> 00:44:45,318
But you were here at that time,
weren't you?

558
00:44:45,452 --> 00:44:47,318
Didn't I hear you say that
you were here?

559
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:52,117
Oh, no, no, no.
Now, Mr.Stanford did not touch it.

560
00:44:52,483 --> 00:44:54,750
No, I just happen to know,
he left without touching it.

561
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:57,616
Oh, that's right,
but I can remember Mr.Logan,

562
00:44:57,783 --> 00:44:59,983
Joe Stevenson, Burnheimer...

563
00:45:00,783 --> 00:45:04,082
Oh look, Miss Bishop, would you
make a list for the Lieutenant?

564
00:45:04,448 --> 00:45:07,114
And put down there anything else
you can remember.

565
00:45:07,214 --> 00:45:12,714
Anything like stolen boxes,
boxes given away... oh, just anything.

566
00:45:18,246 --> 00:45:19,478
What's the matter, Miss Bishop?

567
00:45:22,045 --> 00:45:23,711
The vice president...

568
00:45:24,278 --> 00:45:30,177
He has a supply. Well, the cigar orders
sometimes come in together.

569
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:32,643
Mr.Everett Logan.

570
00:45:32,877 --> 00:45:35,876
Mmm, I have about four boxes left.

571
00:45:40,542 --> 00:45:41,674
Did you say four, sir?

572
00:45:44,874 --> 00:45:46,540
Yes, that's very strange.

573
00:45:50,507 --> 00:45:51,507
Nancy?

574
00:45:52,273 --> 00:45:53,572
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?

575
00:45:56,039 --> 00:45:57,005
Yes, sir?

576
00:45:57,439 --> 00:46:00,638
Oh, here, you've been keeping tabs
on these supplies.

577
00:46:00,738 --> 00:46:03,104
How many boxes of cigars
were there?

578
00:46:03,238 --> 00:46:06,870
Oh, well, I really haven't checked them
much in the last two days.

579
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:09,203
But did you take some home,
Mr.Logan?

580
00:46:09,302 --> 00:46:10,503
No, I did not.

581
00:46:10,603 --> 00:46:12,536
Oh well, they must be in here
someplace.

582
00:46:14,236 --> 00:46:17,235
Oh, please, don't touch the boxes if
you don't mind?

583
00:46:17,801 --> 00:46:20,934
Oh... that'll be all, Nancy.
Thank you, you can go now.

584
00:46:22,434 --> 00:46:24,533
Be sure to close the door
on your way out.

585
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:28,533
If you don't mind, sir, if you'll just
lock this up and not touch anything,

586
00:46:28,633 --> 00:46:30,465
then I'll call a fingerprint crew.

587
00:46:31,565 --> 00:46:35,265
Why Lieutenant? I thought you were
investigating David's accident.

588
00:46:35,365 --> 00:46:37,598
Just covering all bases, sir.

589
00:46:37,698 --> 00:46:40,264
I mean, we haven't found
anything suspicious.

590
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:44,130
He thinks there might have been
a bomb in a cigar box.

591
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:46,096
What?

592
00:46:46,296 --> 00:46:47,763
Well, that's just a theory.

593
00:46:48,596 --> 00:46:52,661
Oh, well of course, we'll cooperate
in any way possible.

594
00:46:52,762 --> 00:46:56,461
I'm afraid that isn't very much of a lock,
and I have had several meetings here.

595
00:46:56,561 --> 00:46:59,527
But... well, I must warn you,
Lieutenant.

596
00:47:00,027 --> 00:47:02,659
Unless you find something
a little bit more important than that,

597
00:47:02,793 --> 00:47:05,259
if one word of a murder investigation...

598
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,859
...is leaked to either the press
or anyone else...!

599
00:47:07,959 --> 00:47:10,958
Oh, no, sir, no.
And that's all I need for now.

600
00:47:11,158 --> 00:47:13,058
Thank you very much, much obliged.

601
00:47:20,757 --> 00:47:24,056
Roger! What the devil is going on
around here?

602
00:47:24,156 --> 00:47:26,023
Does he really think
it wasn't an accident?

603
00:47:43,185 --> 00:47:44,952
Hop in, Lieutenant,
I'll give you a lift.

604
00:47:45,452 --> 00:47:49,618
Oh, thanks. Boy, this plant of
yours is really something.

605
00:47:50,218 --> 00:47:53,118
You know, you can get lost
here just wandering around.

606
00:47:53,317 --> 00:47:56,283
I told you, Lieutenant,
this plant is not mine.

607
00:47:56,384 --> 00:47:57,916
It belongs to my Aunt Doris.

608
00:47:58,449 --> 00:48:00,815
Hey, and you know, about Logan.

609
00:48:01,749 --> 00:48:04,648
You know, he was right when he said
there were a lot of people in his office.

610
00:48:04,949 --> 00:48:07,215
Anybody could've taken that box.

611
00:48:07,881 --> 00:48:09,981
This fellow Logan,
he's quite a friend of yours, I guess.

612
00:48:11,247 --> 00:48:12,847
Oh, well, I mean, he...

613
00:48:13,314 --> 00:48:16,613
He has been nice enough to take
a good deal of interest in my work lately.

614
00:48:16,812 --> 00:48:17,779
Why?

615
00:48:20,612 --> 00:48:23,112
You mean, he sort of
fired you up, like... maybe...?

616
00:48:23,212 --> 00:48:24,544
What?

617
00:48:25,078 --> 00:48:27,544
I found this
in the wastepaper basket,

618
00:48:27,644 --> 00:48:30,343
in the other apartment above
the garage where the chauffeur lived.

619
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:34,210
It looks like some kind of a report
from Mr.Quincy to Mr.Buckner.

620
00:48:34,477 --> 00:48:38,808
And Quincy claims that Mr.Logan,
for some funny reason, was trying...

621
00:48:38,908 --> 00:48:43,742
...to upset you over this sale thing,
using you to manipulate your aunt.

622
00:48:44,208 --> 00:48:45,241
Hey, let me see that.

623
00:48:45,341 --> 00:48:47,174
No, I'd rather not.
It's just hearsay.

624
00:48:47,273 --> 00:48:49,273
I don't want to spread
these rumors around.

625
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:54,506
You know, I really don't understand
this business stuff.

626
00:48:55,072 --> 00:48:57,538
Of course I never could understand
business.

627
00:48:57,972 --> 00:49:00,472
My wife, she always makes out
our taxes.

628
00:49:00,572 --> 00:49:05,903
Oh, by the way, Benson mentioned
that Quincy was one time a cop.

629
00:49:07,404 --> 00:49:11,570
Well, I knew, or suspected rather,
that he...

630
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:14,969
...did some extracurricular work
for my uncle, you know, like...

631
00:49:15,435 --> 00:49:17,634
...checking up on people. Why?

632
00:49:17,735 --> 00:49:22,101
Well, I couldn't find the typewriter
that this report was written on.

633
00:49:22,201 --> 00:49:25,134
And Benson, he had an idea that...

634
00:49:25,233 --> 00:49:29,133
...Quincy might have had
another hideaway someplace.

635
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,499
Something else that
he uses as a base of operations.

636
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:33,632
You know anything about that?

637
00:49:34,665 --> 00:49:35,698
Sorry.

638
00:49:38,565 --> 00:49:40,497
Oh, no, no, no, now, wait a minute.

639
00:49:40,931 --> 00:49:44,397
What is the matter with me?
Of course, you know, one night,

640
00:49:44,497 --> 00:49:47,930
I was dumb enough to get caught in
a poker game with him, y'know what I mean?

641
00:49:48,262 --> 00:49:52,662
And quite by accident, I saw a piece
of paper that was in his wallet.

642
00:49:52,762 --> 00:49:56,261
And it... Well, it didn't say "Quincy"
on it, it said...

643
00:49:57,028 --> 00:50:00,127
"O'Neill", yeah, that's what it said,
"Harry J. O'Neill", yeah.

644
00:50:01,094 --> 00:50:06,826
You know, I can check up on that
right away. Car is right over here.

645
00:50:07,193 --> 00:50:08,659
Thank you very much.

646
00:50:08,759 --> 00:50:09,759
Okay.

647
00:50:10,425 --> 00:50:13,192
I knew you'd be a help to me. Bye.

648
00:51:02,816 --> 00:51:05,315
Mr.Stanford? Roger, wait!

649
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:10,014
What's your problem?

650
00:51:10,114 --> 00:51:12,780
I nearly died out there.
All those questions!

651
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,180
All I could think to say was that
I went to the movies last night.

652
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:20,379
Now, relax, relax! D.L. wasn't
really murdered, and you know it.

653
00:51:20,479 --> 00:51:21,646
Do you know that?

654
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:23,678
That's a funny thing to say.

655
00:51:24,912 --> 00:51:28,844
I'm sorry. Well, it's just that they keep
investigating around here and...

656
00:51:28,944 --> 00:51:31,811
...checking into everything,
like those private personnel files...

657
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:34,210
...I let you look at, like Mr.Logan's.

658
00:51:34,344 --> 00:51:36,443
Oh, I put those back days ago!

659
00:51:37,309 --> 00:51:40,942
It was just curiosity.
Oh, how to succeed in business...

660
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:46,941
Roger... I don't want anyone
to find out about us.

661
00:51:47,307 --> 00:51:50,740
Oh... well, how could they?

662
00:51:52,306 --> 00:51:54,373
You took those pictures of me.

663
00:51:55,539 --> 00:51:59,938
Oh, I cleaned up my desk already
and the darkroom. I got rid of everything.

664
00:52:01,871 --> 00:52:03,404
I'm sorry, it's...

665
00:52:05,438 --> 00:52:07,437
It's just the past few days I...

666
00:52:07,537 --> 00:52:12,103
You know, you need a rest.
Yeah, I authorize it, yeah.

667
00:52:12,203 --> 00:52:15,135
And don't worry about a thing.
It's all gonna be over soon.

668
00:52:15,235 --> 00:52:17,202
Believe me... all soon.

669
00:52:28,433 --> 00:52:30,333
It'll be dark in a while.

670
00:52:30,466 --> 00:52:33,132
But we'll send the climbers up again
first thing in the morning.

671
00:52:33,232 --> 00:52:34,999
We'll try the lower cliffs.

672
00:52:35,231 --> 00:52:36,865
No piece of the cigar box, yet?

673
00:52:36,998 --> 00:52:39,065
No. It's funny.

674
00:52:40,597 --> 00:52:45,797
There are some things we're finding
intact, others smashed, others burnt.

675
00:52:47,063 --> 00:52:48,862
Well anyway, we're still trying.

676
00:52:48,963 --> 00:52:52,063
Here. I thought you might wanna
see this.

677
00:52:54,095 --> 00:52:55,594
A piece of the gas tank.

678
00:52:55,761 --> 00:52:58,061
Yeah. And it did explode.

679
00:52:59,227 --> 00:53:01,593
The autopsy report's not
much help either.

680
00:53:01,694 --> 00:53:02,760
I heard.

681
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:04,226
Just burns.

682
00:53:04,327 --> 00:53:06,993
Nothing on the tissue to prove
any foreign inflammable.

683
00:53:07,426 --> 00:53:09,925
Maybe some kind of
petroleum jelly was used.

684
00:53:11,758 --> 00:53:12,792
Something will turn up.

685
00:53:12,892 --> 00:53:14,491
How can you be so sure?

686
00:53:14,792 --> 00:53:19,190
Well, it's a big corporation,
kind of like a jungle, to coin a phrase.

687
00:55:33,899 --> 00:55:36,831
There shouldn't be anybody in there.
Cover the front, I'll get the back.

688
00:55:54,429 --> 00:55:55,328
Stop!

689
00:56:00,394 --> 00:56:01,327
Stop!

690
00:56:17,491 --> 00:56:20,324
Roger! I don't believe it!
What were you doing?

691
00:56:20,424 --> 00:56:23,290
Nothing! Oh, I do wish you would
listen to me Aunt Dory...

692
00:56:23,456 --> 00:56:24,790
You haven't answered me!

693
00:56:24,889 --> 00:56:29,889
I can't! I can't.
Not with these two men here.

694
00:56:30,589 --> 00:56:32,521
Would you mind leaving us alone,
please?

695
00:56:32,621 --> 00:56:34,288
Sorry, ma'am,
they told me to bring him over here,

696
00:56:34,388 --> 00:56:36,254
but that doesn't mean
I can let him out of my sight.

697
00:56:36,354 --> 00:56:39,320
Listen, I got here as fast as I could.
Where is Farrell?

698
00:56:39,487 --> 00:56:40,654
Oh, good evening, ma'am.

699
00:56:40,754 --> 00:56:43,452
Lieutenant Columbo,
I'd like an explanation of this.

700
00:56:43,619 --> 00:56:45,686
He's on the way. Look, I told her
where we caught him.

701
00:56:45,786 --> 00:56:48,486
He broke in, entered,
tore up the place, resisted arrest...

702
00:56:48,585 --> 00:56:50,518
They literally jumped me.

703
00:56:50,618 --> 00:56:53,385
All right, we're gonna get this thing
cleared up, just as fast as we can.

704
00:56:53,485 --> 00:56:54,784
Don't worry about that.

705
00:56:54,951 --> 00:56:57,017
Now, say,
I thought you said to me that...

706
00:56:57,117 --> 00:56:59,417
...you had no idea where
Quincy's hideaway was?

707
00:56:59,683 --> 00:57:02,949
Well, I didn't. But then I remembered
this car salesman...

708
00:57:03,049 --> 00:57:05,382
...that Quincy was friendly with,
and he did.

709
00:57:05,649 --> 00:57:09,948
Lieutenant, look, if I could just talk
to you alone for a few minutes...

710
00:57:10,415 --> 00:57:12,881
Excuse me, please.
What do you have, Farrell?

711
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:15,347
I just brought a couple of things.
The typewriter was there, and...

712
00:57:15,447 --> 00:57:17,346
...we got quite a bit of
information from his file.

713
00:57:17,446 --> 00:57:20,413
Dossiers, actually.
I left Charlie there to go over them.

714
00:57:20,513 --> 00:57:22,312
What I brought you is
a couple of things here...

715
00:57:22,412 --> 00:57:24,445
Dossiers? What kind of dossiers?

716
00:57:26,012 --> 00:57:27,978
Something about Mr.Logan?

717
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:30,144
What makes you say that?

718
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:33,111
You see, this afternoon I found
something in the pocket of...

719
00:57:33,277 --> 00:57:37,143
...one of David's suits.
Some sort of report about Everett Logan.

720
00:57:37,643 --> 00:57:40,709
Personal information.
Very damaging.

721
00:57:41,742 --> 00:57:42,942
From Quincy?

722
00:57:43,075 --> 00:57:44,209
May I see it?

723
00:57:44,308 --> 00:57:47,541
I burned it, Lieutenant.
You see, I finally realized that...

724
00:57:47,874 --> 00:57:51,207
...David was using Quincy
to keep tabs on the executives.

725
00:57:52,806 --> 00:57:55,140
All right, Mrs.Buckner,
would you give me a moment, please?

726
00:57:59,306 --> 00:58:01,438
There is quite a bit of stuff
on Logan there.

727
00:58:01,538 --> 00:58:03,071
Also on a couple of other executives.

728
00:58:03,171 --> 00:58:06,204
Only take a look at this.
Quincy's bankbook.

729
00:58:08,604 --> 00:58:11,536
New account... pretty big deposit.

730
00:58:12,037 --> 00:58:15,636
Yeah, nice guy, Quincy. Looks like he's
trying to put the bite on his own boss.

731
00:58:16,669 --> 00:58:18,135
Look, here.

732
00:58:18,402 --> 00:58:20,735
That's what I took off the kid
when I caught him.

733
00:58:21,302 --> 00:58:24,101
That's the only thing he tried
to get out of Quincy's.

734
00:58:24,368 --> 00:58:27,800
And I guess he was in quite a bit of a
hurry because he forgot the negative.

735
00:58:36,499 --> 00:58:38,932
Uh, Mrs.Buckner,
will you excuse us for a moment?

736
00:58:39,032 --> 00:58:41,531
I want to speak to Mr.Stanford
for a moment.

737
00:58:42,231 --> 00:58:44,364
I think we can settle this right now.

738
00:58:44,697 --> 00:58:46,297
Hey, wait a minute,
that's evidence, lady!

739
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:48,763
No! Don't let her see them!
Aunt Dory, you give them back!

740
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:51,162
Valerie Bishop and David?

741
00:58:51,896 --> 00:58:54,795
Look, Why do you think
I went there?

742
00:58:54,896 --> 00:58:57,228
I knew Quincy would have something
like that!

743
00:58:57,328 --> 00:58:59,928
Now you've let her see
the very thing I never wanted her to.

744
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:04,493
It's all right, Rog, I have to see things.
I have to see everything.

745
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,893
But I'm the only one,
do you understand, Lieutenant?

746
00:59:08,093 --> 00:59:09,926
I want this trash burned.

747
00:59:10,159 --> 00:59:12,092
But ma'am,
we can't destroy evidence.

748
00:59:12,192 --> 00:59:14,292
There's no evidence
if there's no murder.

749
00:59:14,492 --> 00:59:15,958
And you haven't proved
there was a murder.

750
00:59:16,058 --> 00:59:17,358
But ma'am,
if we had a little more time...

751
00:59:17,458 --> 00:59:19,458
Will you please get out of here
and leave us alone!

752
00:59:19,558 --> 00:59:21,523
Look, I'm sorry about
what's happened here tonight...

753
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:22,991
Please get out!

754
00:59:43,419 --> 00:59:44,986
I'm truly sorry.

755
00:59:46,586 --> 00:59:47,719
Oh, Rog,

756
00:59:48,886 --> 00:59:53,718
I liked that woman very much.
All the time, she and David...

757
00:59:54,517 --> 00:59:57,184
I never wanted you to know
about this, ever.

758
00:59:57,850 --> 01:00:00,550
I mean, I've known for a couple of
years about them, but...

759
01:00:01,416 --> 01:00:03,883
Well, it's only recently that
I realized that Quincy was...

760
01:00:03,983 --> 01:00:05,716
...beginning to snoop around.

761
01:00:06,515 --> 01:00:07,682
You knew?

762
01:00:08,515 --> 01:00:09,514
Oh, yes.

763
01:00:10,715 --> 01:00:12,748
I went to David, I asked him to stop.

764
01:00:14,414 --> 01:00:15,947
He refused.

765
01:00:17,413 --> 01:00:19,447
No wonder he turned against you.

766
01:00:20,046 --> 01:00:22,913
No wonder he kept demeaning you
in front of me.

767
01:00:24,512 --> 01:00:27,678
Oh, Rog, dear, I've been...
I've been such a fool.

768
01:00:28,911 --> 01:00:31,510
I've misunderstood everything so.

769
01:00:33,844 --> 01:00:34,877
There, there

770
01:01:10,137 --> 01:01:12,637
Thank you Benson.
Five o'clock, please.

771
01:01:24,834 --> 01:01:26,868
Oh! Oh, hi, Junior.

772
01:01:27,868 --> 01:01:30,100
Uh... excuse me, Mr.Stanford.

773
01:01:32,733 --> 01:01:34,600
Good morning, Mr.Stanford.

774
01:01:34,765 --> 01:01:36,632
Good morning, Mr.Stanford.

775
01:01:44,097 --> 01:01:45,164
What's wrong?

776
01:01:46,531 --> 01:01:49,096
Oh... excuse me.

777
01:01:50,196 --> 01:01:54,896
I just found this on the desk.
It's from the personnel manager.

778
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:58,761
Well, I... I tried to reach you at the
house but you'd already gone, and...

779
01:01:59,095 --> 01:02:01,061
Your aunt wouldn't
come to the phone.

780
01:02:01,194 --> 01:02:04,994
You know, she hasn't answered one
single call from me since the funeral?

781
01:02:06,093 --> 01:02:09,160
I sent her up to Pinewild for a short
rest. It was the doctor's orders.

782
01:02:09,426 --> 01:02:13,259
Let me see this.
Well, that's a pink slip.

783
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:17,991
That stupid personnel department,
you're not fired!

784
01:02:18,091 --> 01:02:19,691
Well... but I don't understand.

785
01:02:20,058 --> 01:02:23,390
You see, my aunt remembered
how much your mother...

786
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:26,256
...always wanted to live in the desert
in Arizona, wasn't it?

787
01:02:26,389 --> 01:02:29,590
And she thought that
you might be happier there, too.

788
01:02:30,589 --> 01:02:32,288
Roger, I can't afford that.

789
01:02:32,555 --> 01:02:37,654
Oh, I'll take care of that.
And listen, don't you worry.

790
01:02:38,354 --> 01:02:41,820
We'll see each other a lot.
Yeah, a lot.

791
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:43,620
Yeah, a lot...

792
01:02:45,353 --> 01:02:47,452
I'm gonna be here for quite a while.
You can come back later.

793
01:02:47,552 --> 01:02:49,885
Would you tell Maintenance
I'll keep the desk and the chair.

794
01:02:49,985 --> 01:02:52,152
The rest of the stuff is
just dreary.

795
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:55,817
Yeah, I'll have a decorator come in
next week and refurnish.

796
01:02:55,917 --> 01:02:57,483
And what about your office?

797
01:02:57,584 --> 01:02:58,717
Your old office?

798
01:02:58,817 --> 01:03:01,783
Oh, I don't care. Wrap it up,
give it away. I don't particularly care.

799
01:03:40,443 --> 01:03:42,342
I don't want to be disturbed,
Miss Bishop.

800
01:03:42,442 --> 01:03:45,108
<i>Well, it's Mr. Logan
and Lieutenant Columbo.</i>

801
01:03:50,174 --> 01:03:52,807
Well, tell them...
tell them to come in.

802
01:04:04,371 --> 01:04:05,738
Ah, gentlemen.

803
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:09,270
Uh... I hate to interrupt like this,
Mr.Stanford.

804
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:11,103
But Miss Bishop said you were in.

805
01:04:11,304 --> 01:04:13,270
So I am. What can I do for you?

806
01:04:13,437 --> 01:04:16,469
Uh, quite a surprise, I mean,
I went down to your old office,

807
01:04:16,570 --> 01:04:18,336
but they told me you moved in here.

808
01:04:20,069 --> 01:04:22,502
Lieutenant, would you mind
coming to the point?

809
01:04:22,602 --> 01:04:24,835
Oh, certainly. By the way,

810
01:04:25,101 --> 01:04:27,668
Miss Bishop seems unhappy,
did something go wrong?

811
01:04:28,967 --> 01:04:30,433
I have no idea.

812
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:35,166
Could you explain the reason
for your interruption, Lieutenant?

813
01:04:35,266 --> 01:04:40,399
Oh, yeah. Well, I came to get you,
and Mr.Logan here.

814
01:04:41,132 --> 01:04:44,298
Of course, the a funny thing,
I found him cleaning out his desk, too.

815
01:04:45,464 --> 01:04:47,330
Well... Whatever for, Everett?

816
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:48,864
I've been fired!

817
01:04:49,263 --> 01:04:54,429
Fired? Oh, I find that very hard
to believe, Everett.

818
01:04:54,663 --> 01:04:57,528
Do you? It was your aunt's request.

819
01:04:57,662 --> 01:04:59,862
She wouldn't even talk to me
on the phone when I called.

820
01:05:00,161 --> 01:05:01,694
Oh, obviously, it's a mistake.

821
01:05:01,794 --> 01:05:04,828
Obviously, we were rather close,
if you'll remember.

822
01:05:04,928 --> 01:05:06,661
You wouldn't have any possible idea...

823
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,827
...why she might have changed
her mind about me, would you?

824
01:05:08,927 --> 01:05:10,959
Oh, no, no, none whatsoever.

825
01:05:11,493 --> 01:05:14,126
Of course, you know,
it is a family corporation.

826
01:05:14,226 --> 01:05:17,458
So she has every right to do
whatever she chooses.

827
01:05:18,025 --> 01:05:20,257
Uh, this must've fallen over.

828
01:05:23,257 --> 01:05:24,757
Lieutenant...

829
01:05:25,124 --> 01:05:28,190
You take an inordinate length of time
to come to the point.

830
01:05:28,756 --> 01:05:32,756
Oh, well, I heard from the people
at the Pinewild Sheriff's office.

831
01:05:32,855 --> 01:05:35,122
They're gonna meet us
at the bottom of the grade.

832
01:05:35,421 --> 01:05:39,588
Oh, no, I'm awfully sorry.
Perhaps Mr.Logan could go along, but,

833
01:05:39,687 --> 01:05:43,453
I'm afraid I'm just much too busy
this morning to go for a long drive.

834
01:05:43,587 --> 01:05:46,586
Oh, I see. I just thought
you'd wanna know what they found.

835
01:05:46,853 --> 01:05:49,686
I mean, you are interested
in any latest development, aren't you?

836
01:05:49,819 --> 01:05:52,019
Of course I am. What was it?

837
01:05:52,285 --> 01:05:55,185
You know, they didn't say.
They just said it was very important.

838
01:05:55,717 --> 01:05:58,484
Oh, it seems very peculiar
if they didn't say what it was.

839
01:05:58,617 --> 01:06:00,850
Sure does.
All right, Mr.Logan, let's go.

840
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:04,116
Fine. Doris will be up at the cabin
and I wanna talk with her.

841
01:06:04,283 --> 01:06:06,249
Uh... just a minute, Lieutenant.

842
01:06:06,849 --> 01:06:09,348
If this does concern
my uncle's death,

843
01:06:09,448 --> 01:06:12,081
I suppose, in good conscience,
I should go along.

844
01:06:12,581 --> 01:06:14,347
Fine. I've got the car outside.

845
01:06:25,813 --> 01:06:27,279
Hi, Sergeant.

846
01:06:27,379 --> 01:06:28,412
Lieutenant.

847
01:06:29,078 --> 01:06:30,012
Is that it?

848
01:06:30,112 --> 01:06:32,511
Yeah. Pretty good shape, too,
considering...

849
01:06:32,911 --> 01:06:35,677
See right up there
to the left of the second dark crag?

850
01:06:35,777 --> 01:06:38,510
You can't see the road from here,
but it's right to the left of that.

851
01:06:38,610 --> 01:06:40,843
Just about a couple hundred feet
from where they went over.

852
01:06:40,943 --> 01:06:43,442
Well, they must've been blown apart
like the cap and that other stuff.

853
01:06:43,543 --> 01:06:45,975
Yeah, skidded right into a crevice.

854
01:06:46,075 --> 01:06:47,241
What is it, Lieutenant?

855
01:06:47,341 --> 01:06:50,275
I think that we ought to get this
information to your aunt in a hurry.

856
01:06:50,375 --> 01:06:51,407
So, let's go on, now.

857
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:52,774
No, no, no,
I.. I sent her up to the cabin,

858
01:06:52,874 --> 01:06:55,440
So she wouldn't be disturbed.
It would take us hours to get there.

859
01:06:55,541 --> 01:06:57,174
No, no, we'll be there in no time.
Here, Sergeant.

860
01:06:57,274 --> 01:06:58,439
Engineer's waiting for you.

861
01:06:58,540 --> 01:06:59,773
Thank you very much. This way.

862
01:07:39,598 --> 01:07:41,999
Yeah, your aunt put me
on this contraption.

863
01:07:42,398 --> 01:07:44,764
She said it was
a lot faster than driving.

864
01:07:51,363 --> 01:07:56,062
A lot safer. Hope she's right.

865
01:07:57,428 --> 01:07:59,595
Well, let's look in this, huh?

866
01:08:00,061 --> 01:08:01,528
Yes, I'd like to know what they found.

867
01:08:01,628 --> 01:08:03,061
Let's see what we have.

868
01:08:03,528 --> 01:08:04,795
Uh-huh.

869
01:08:20,957 --> 01:08:24,490
Why that's...
that's David's cigar box!

870
01:08:25,457 --> 01:08:28,656
I told you this would be worth
coming out for, didn't I?

871
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:32,256
Yeah... yeah, it sure is.

872
01:08:32,689 --> 01:08:35,522
You see, except for the hinges
which are a little shaky,

873
01:08:36,188 --> 01:08:37,921
this whole thing is in one piece.

874
01:08:38,021 --> 01:08:41,021
This means that David was not
murdered, doesn't it, huh?

875
01:08:41,287 --> 01:08:43,554
Oh yes, sir.
Yes, this changes everything.

876
01:08:43,654 --> 01:08:46,653
There's no question about it,
yeah, uh...

877
01:08:46,953 --> 01:08:48,886
Must've been the gas tank after all.

878
01:08:49,685 --> 01:08:54,385
Ah... that's... that's comforting news.
I mean, for her.

879
01:08:54,951 --> 01:08:56,118
Even so,

880
01:08:56,252 --> 01:08:58,818
I'm afraid she's not gonna be
very happy to see me up there.

881
01:08:58,917 --> 01:09:01,550
Why? Do you think that she blamed you
for her husband's death?

882
01:09:02,017 --> 01:09:03,983
Well, I certainly do.

883
01:09:04,883 --> 01:09:08,682
I mean, after all, I was the one that was
fighting David on this sale business.

884
01:09:08,816 --> 01:09:12,282
Everybody knew that.
I figured some troublemaker...

885
01:09:12,382 --> 01:09:14,947
...misunderstood and stole the box
out of my office.

886
01:09:15,814 --> 01:09:16,814
Fortunately, I was wrong.

887
01:09:16,914 --> 01:09:19,547
I can't tell you how good
that cigar box looks to me!

888
01:09:19,981 --> 01:09:24,180
Now, if I can just get Doris to tell me
why she let me go.

889
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:26,212
Oh, I can tell you that.

890
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:27,513
You can?

891
01:09:27,612 --> 01:09:29,945
Yeah, I think she fired you
for a couple of reasons.

892
01:09:30,045 --> 01:09:32,478
Like those secret meetings that you
had with the competition last year.

893
01:09:32,578 --> 01:09:35,145
Like that patent that you sold
to a friend very cheaply...

894
01:09:35,410 --> 01:09:37,444
What are you talking about?
Those are lies!

895
01:09:37,577 --> 01:09:38,576
Really?

896
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:42,009
Well, Mr.Quincy wrote'em all down
in a report to Mr.Buckner.

897
01:09:42,109 --> 01:09:45,042
Well, then Quincy made it up himself.
They're simply not true.

898
01:09:45,143 --> 01:09:48,275
You promised Aunt Dory never to say
anything about that.

899
01:09:48,408 --> 01:09:50,242
What are you trying to do?
Cause more trouble?

900
01:09:50,508 --> 01:09:51,975
Well, it doesn't make
any difference now.

901
01:09:52,074 --> 01:09:55,307
I mean, everything's changed now,
isn't it? Because of this!

902
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:58,507
You know, and then there was
that thing with Miss Bishop...

903
01:09:58,607 --> 01:10:00,473
Lieutenant, now, that,
that is private information.

904
01:10:00,572 --> 01:10:03,039
Wait a minute.
What thing with Miss Bishop?

905
01:10:03,139 --> 01:10:04,439
Now, I am warning you!

906
01:10:04,539 --> 01:10:06,605
Well, you see, Miss Bishop and
Mr.Buckner, you know,

907
01:10:06,705 --> 01:10:08,438
for the past year or so, they...

908
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:09,371
That is enough!

909
01:10:11,238 --> 01:10:13,203
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.

910
01:10:13,470 --> 01:10:18,336
Just I... I just don't know why we ca...
Why we can't... uh, sit here...

911
01:10:19,202 --> 01:10:21,935
...sit here and...
and just sit here quietly...

912
01:10:22,035 --> 01:10:24,136
...while we ride to the top of
the mountain.

913
01:10:24,335 --> 01:10:27,401
You know something, Roger?
The truth is hard to find.

914
01:10:27,634 --> 01:10:31,467
Sometimes... sometimes it's right in front
of you and you can't prove it.

915
01:10:32,367 --> 01:10:33,134
What?

916
01:10:33,767 --> 01:10:34,867
Do you know?

917
01:10:34,967 --> 01:10:39,199
I had a whole theory worked out
how you could've fixed this box here.

918
01:10:39,365 --> 01:10:42,332
Well, I mean, a high I.Q. thing...

919
01:10:42,432 --> 01:10:45,031
...so that the explosive might not
be discovered.

920
01:10:45,132 --> 01:10:47,197
It might get burned up with the gasoline.

921
01:10:47,598 --> 01:10:48,964
Oh, yes!

922
01:10:49,064 --> 01:10:53,029
I had a theory worked out how
you could've done all sorts of things!

923
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:54,396
Now...

924
01:10:55,896 --> 01:11:00,362
Now, it turns out to be
just an ordinary cigar box.

925
01:11:01,595 --> 01:11:02,428
Yeah!

926
01:11:04,261 --> 01:11:06,161
Well, listen, now that...

927
01:11:06,627 --> 01:11:09,793
Don't you think you should take it to
a laboratory and have it examined?

928
01:11:09,893 --> 01:11:12,160
I mean, you've got all these
fancy theories.

929
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:16,592
What on earth for? The theories are
all wrong. That would only prove it.

930
01:11:16,759 --> 01:11:18,658
Oh, no, that would make me
look foolish.

931
01:11:18,759 --> 01:11:20,791
Mr.Logan,
would you care for a cigar?

932
01:11:21,125 --> 01:11:22,058
No, thank you.

933
01:11:22,358 --> 01:11:23,125
No?

934
01:11:23,991 --> 01:11:25,857
And you know,
the funny thing is this, Roger,

935
01:11:26,290 --> 01:11:28,823
this whole thing could've been
a plan of yours.

936
01:11:29,323 --> 01:11:31,223
Like those reports of Mr.Quincy's.

937
01:11:31,323 --> 01:11:33,922
You could've forged those
on his typewriter.

938
01:11:34,022 --> 01:11:36,821
And the photograph between
Miss Bishop and your uncle.

939
01:11:37,455 --> 01:11:39,554
Any good photographer could
trick that up.

940
01:11:39,921 --> 01:11:44,820
Y'know, just do some double printing,
replace one figure with somebody else's.

941
01:11:45,286 --> 01:11:47,453
And even Mr.Quincy's
new bank account.

942
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:50,486
That could have been opened
by anybody. Even you.

943
01:11:51,019 --> 01:11:53,818
Yes, and Mr.Logan's cigars being stolen.

944
01:11:54,585 --> 01:11:57,018
You see now, there you go, you're looking
at your watch again.

945
01:11:57,251 --> 01:12:00,517
Would you do me a favor?
Would you please keep quiet?

946
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:03,083
Why?
It's only a dumb theory of mine.

947
01:12:03,183 --> 01:12:05,483
I mean, it only goes to prove
how wrong I could've been.

948
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:07,083
You see, what I figured...

949
01:12:07,182 --> 01:12:10,449
I figured there was two people
between you and the presidency.

950
01:12:10,915 --> 01:12:14,348
Mr.Logan here and your uncle.
And now, there's just you.

951
01:12:14,848 --> 01:12:16,714
Of course, you had to fire Miss Bishop.

952
01:12:16,814 --> 01:12:19,947
I mean, an executive secretary,
she probably knows too much.

953
01:12:20,047 --> 01:12:25,279
Everett, are you just gonna sit here
and let him just mumble on?

954
01:12:26,279 --> 01:12:29,645
Why not, Roger?
It's all very interesting.

955
01:12:29,912 --> 01:12:31,745
You... you are more of a fool
than he is!

956
01:12:32,212 --> 01:12:35,111
The trouble is, even if I was right...

957
01:12:35,211 --> 01:12:37,311
What? Will you just shut up?

958
01:12:46,576 --> 01:12:49,541
Roger, what's bothering you?
What's the matter?

959
01:12:49,641 --> 01:12:50,508
Shut up!

960
01:12:51,641 --> 01:12:52,508
Oh, my...

961
01:12:58,407 --> 01:13:00,207
We have got to get rid of that box!

962
01:13:00,506 --> 01:13:01,406
Why? What for?

963
01:13:08,605 --> 01:13:11,604
Give me that box!
Give me that box!

964
01:13:11,704 --> 01:13:14,003
Aaagh, give me that...

965
01:13:24,535 --> 01:13:27,768
Where did you get that...
that box of cigars, Lieutenant?

966
01:13:28,301 --> 01:13:29,668
From your secretary.

967
01:13:30,101 --> 01:13:32,167
My secretary? Hmm.

968
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:37,166
Yeah, she... she had three boxes.
I hope you didn't mind.

969
01:13:37,933 --> 01:13:41,798
No, I don't suppose I do
in this case, but...

970
01:13:45,898 --> 01:13:50,731
Oh, aren't those supposed to be
evidence, Lieutenant Columbo?

971
01:13:51,464 --> 01:13:54,830
Yeah, I guess they are, it's a shame.

972
01:14:10,294 --> 01:14:11,493
You...
