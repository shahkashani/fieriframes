Follow your inner moonlight; don't hide the madness.
We're all golden sunflowers inside.
Our heads are round so thought can change direction
I know too much and not enough
Poets are damned… but see with the eyes of angels.
Democracy! Bah! When I hear that I reach for my feather boa!
We are great writers on the same dreadful typewriter
America I've given you all and now I'm nothing.
Everybody's serious but me.
Candor disarms paranoia.
America, why are your libraries full of tears?
Follow your inner moonlight, don’t hide the madness.
What if someone gave a war and nobody came?
You too must seek the sun.
The universe is mad, slightly mad.
What came is gone forever every time.
What is obscenity? And to whom?
Naked in solitary prison cell he looks down at a hard-on.
No more to say, and nothing to weep for
Scientist alone is true poet.
Inside skull vast as outside skull
YOUR NAME IS WRITTEN IN HEAVEN
Anger falling asleep at the heart
Thank God I am not God! Thank God I am not God!
Trees scream and drop bright leaves
...salute the new sunset
America, the plum blossoms are falling.
Clock hands move noonward.
