00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,300
sick.

549
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:54,560
Well, guys can't handle
their emotions too well.

550
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,430
That's why they don't
like heavy conversations.

551
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,640
It was probably just too much
for him.

552
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:03,570
All the love and the great
sex that you were giving him.

553
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:05,980
I guess that's what it was.

554
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:08,070
But, I don't know.

careful.

messing with love spells

was hostile to witches.

575

Well, it's certainly not San
Francisco.

576
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,900
But it's not bad for a small
town.

577

Not all of them embrace our
methods

00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:30,570
of practicing witchcraft.

579
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:34,410
But, I don't see why we
ought to be so uptight now.

580
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:37,740
Back in the day, we all made
love freely

581
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:42,000
and put up Baphomet posters
and no one was dogmatic

582
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,540
about whether they were a witch
or a Satanist or a Thelemite

583
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:48,460
or a Druid or a Wiccan or
whatever.

584
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:50,630

Hi.

611
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,080
[BOTH] Hi.

612
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:10,790
I was just pointing out that
dancing

613
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,710
is a powerful thing for women
and girls.

614
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,260
We asked you to meet us here
tonight

615
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,760
so you could learn about that.

616
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:22,930
Do you see how powerful that
girl is?

617
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:27,140
These men would do anything for
her.

618
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:31,150
Wouldn't you like to have
that power yourselves?

619
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:33,400
Then let us begin.

620
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:38,110
All witches need to figure
out where their power lies.

621
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:41,160
And we feel that a woman's
greatest power

622
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,990
lies in her sexuality.

623
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:47,960
We don't view this power as
Satanic or anti-feminist,

624
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:52,630
but as a celebration of
woman as a natural creature.

625
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:57,130
An earthly body, a spiritual
essence, and a womb.

626
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,180
The whole history of
witchcraft is interwoven

627
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:05,010
with the fear of female
sexuality.

628
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:08,230
They burned us at the
stake because they feared

629
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:11,520
the erotic feelings we elicited
in them.

630
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:14,860
Later, they used marriage
to hold us in bondage

631
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:19,030
and made us into servants,
whores, and fantasy dolls

632
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:22,030
never asking us what we wanted.

633
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:25,540
They teach us that a
normative human being

634
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:28,370
is a hyper-rationalist, stoic
male

635
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:32,330
and that women's emotions
and intuitions are illnesses

636
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,170
that need to be cured.

637
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:38,800
And we believe that men
and women are different

638
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:42,890
and that true equality
lies in that difference.

639
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:45,890
We strive for male/female
polarity and to regain

640
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:47,680
our primal power as goddesses.

wear high heels and makeup,

learn to dress your
hair in attractive ways,

647
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:08,120
display flesh artfully,
and know what to conceal.

Be a mother and a lover.

let the man feel like a man.

fear of you

651

and to open his heart to
the floodgates of love.

652
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:29,770
Only then will he begin to
see you as a human being

653

with all of your inner beauty.

654

love,

will.

I'm Shelly Curtis.

725
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:54,670
I phoned about Wayne Peters,
the teacher who disappeared.

726
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:56,430
Yes, of course.

727
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:58,970
Have a seat, Miss Curtis.

728
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:04,640
You say you think Mr. Peters
might have been kidnapped?

729
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:08,020
Yes, no one's seen him for two
weeks.

730
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:11,820
I went by his house and
the mail's piled up.

731
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:14,820
We had lunch the day he
disappeared.

732
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:19,280
I saw him drive away with a
strange woman near the plaza.

733
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,290
Do you have any idea where
he might have gone with her?

Wayne used to spend weekends

735

up in a cabin he had in the
woods.

736
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:30,170

sharp

corresponds of our Halloween.

Summer Solstice, Litha,

878

or the Winter Solstice,
which they call Imbolg.

kiss the devil's behind

884

sacrifice are the black witches

885

who perform blood rituals
to gain demonic powers

886
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:50,620
and to bind their members
together in secrecy.

out these cults for decades

but they've been unsuccessful.

889
01:05:55,130 --> 01:05:57,250
Then there are the
white witches or Wiccans

890
01:05:57,290 --> 01:05:59,710
who commune in nature
in the healing spirit

891
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:02,880
and who have a strict law
that forbids harming others.

He says we have a policy
of leaving the witches alone.

1197
01:30:11,580 --> 01:30:13,960
He says they've lived
in this town a long time

1198
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,790
and he doesn't like to mess with
them.

Even if they murder?

1200
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:20,320

that Wayne's death

found.

1205
01:30:38,110 --> 01:30:40,860
Now, Elaine used to run
an organic beauty store

1206
01:30:40,900 --> 01:30:42,860
in Berkeley with her husband,
Jerry.

1207
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:44,610
Two years later they were
divorced

1208
01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:46,200
and Elaine moved to San
Francisco

1209
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:48,370
to start dancing at a burlesque
club

1210
01:30:48,410 --> 01:30:51,830
where she got involved with a
witch coven.

1211
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:01,460
The coven broke up
after police questioning

1212
01:31:01,510 --> 01:31:04,130
when some of it's members
died mysteriously.

1213
01:31:04,170 --> 01:31:08,300
Soon after, Elaine's ex-husband
died of a drug overdose

1214
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:12,680
shortly before he was planning
to remarry.

1215
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:14,270
The police questioned Elaine

1216
01:31:14,310 --> 01:31:17,060
but they couldn't find enough to
hold her.

1217
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:19,860
Well, if the San Francisco
Police couldn't find anything,

1218
01:31:19,900 --> 01:31:21,820
what happened there is
none of our business.

1219
01:31:21,860 --> 01:31:23,530
Are you serious?

1220
01:31:23,570 --> 01:31:25,990
I'd say this woman is
a dangerous character

1221
01:31:26,030 --> 01:31:28,070
and you better watch her.

1222
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:30,740
You mean because she's a
witch?

1223
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:32,620
That doesn't mean anything.

1224
01:31:32,660 --> 01:31:36,670
No, her husband died of a
drug he'd never taken before.

1225
01:31:36,710 --> 01:31:38,100

Wayne Peters

1226

that.

growing near his cabin.

often with drugs.

01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:52,260
I wanted to come.

1258
01:33:54,510 --> 01:33:58,220
I can't help but blaming
myself for what happened.

1259
01:33:58,270 --> 01:34:00,480
You can't blame yourself.

1260
01:34:00,850 --> 01:34:03,480
You were a good wife to Richard.

1261
01:34:05,110 --> 01:34:06,400
I tried to be.

1262
01:34:08,610 --> 01:34:11,070
I tried so hard to please him,

1263
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:14,410
but I should have tried harder.

1264
01:34:14,450 --> 01:34:18,580
He wanted a certain type of
woman, someone I could never be.

1265
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:22,910
Maybe you were right.

1266
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:26,790
Maybe you should give a man his
fantasy.

1267
01:34:28,460 --> 01:34:32,340
I thought that was so
awful when you said that.

1268
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:34,800
Maybe I was being naive,

1269
01:34:35,340 --> 01:34:38,640
but I really thought he loved me
for me.

1270
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:41,890
But now, now I wish...

1271
01:34:46,650 --> 01:34:49,780
You have to stop torturing
yourself.

1272
01:34:50,110 --> 01:34:51,650
You have to let go.

1273
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:56,320
Remember how he changed
after my Dallas trip?

1274
01:34:56,370 --> 01:34:59,830
I think that's when he
started having that affair.

1275
01:34:59,870 --> 01:35:02,830
Whoever she was she drove him
crazy.

1276
01:35:04,210 --> 01:35:06,580
I hated him so much for that.

1277
01:35:07,540 --> 01:35:09,750
I wanted to kill them both.

1278
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:14,590
If I ever found out who she
was, I would rip her to pieces.

1279
01:35:15,430 --> 01:35:18,640
But now I see I should have
helped him.

1280
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:23,350
I didn't know that he was
going to take his own life.

1281
01:35:24,890 --> 01:35:25,890

1282
01:35:26,850 --> 01:35:27,850
hey.

1283
01:35:30,110 --> 01:35:31,570

Who is he?

1287
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:45,210
He's a detective and he's
everything

1288
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:47,420
a woman could ever want.

1289
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:51,920
He's strong and handsome, smart
and kind.

1290
01:35:54,590 --> 01:35:57,050
I just know that he's the one.

1291
01:35:58,140 --> 01:36:00,260
He even gave me this ring.

1292
01:36:00,550 --> 01:36:02,510
I call it my magic ring.

1293
01:36:03,390 --> 01:36:04,520
It's not an engagement ring

1294
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:08,690
but I just know that he's
gonna pop the question soon.

1295
01:36:24,410 --> 01:36:25,370
When we first came here

1296
01:36:25,410 --> 01:36:28,870
I showed you my engagement ring,
remember?

1297
01:36:31,170 --> 01:36:32,790
I can barely stand to look at it
anymore.

1298
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:34,210
It's too painful.

1299
01:36:36,630 --> 01:36:39,590
I'm sure he's going to ask you
soon.

1300
01:36:39,630 --> 01:36:43,050
You're going to make a beautiful
bride.

1301
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:44,810
The first day we met,

1302
01:36:46,140 --> 01:36:48,980
you were envious of me because I
had a man

1303
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:50,900
and you were all alone.

1304
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:53,570

is a superior way to live?
