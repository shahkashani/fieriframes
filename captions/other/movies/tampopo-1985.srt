1
00:01:11,601 --> 00:01:12,728
Oh...

2
00:01:17,512 --> 00:01:19,503
So you're at a movie too.

3
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,747
What are you eating?

4
00:01:24,638 --> 00:01:27,358
You know the noises
people make in cinemas...

5
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:32,164
eating potato chips,
crumpling wrappers.

6
00:01:32,528 --> 00:01:33,837
I really can't stand it...

7
00:01:48,888 --> 00:01:50,403
Are they good?

8
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:53,464
Sure. Curry-flavored.

9
00:01:55,058 --> 00:01:58,785
I'll kill you if you make that noise
once the movie starts.

10
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:02,036
Understand?

11
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:07,591
And...

12
00:02:07,691 --> 00:02:11,719
I also don't like
watch alarms going off.

13
00:02:12,076 --> 00:02:15,407
I don't want interruptions.

14
00:02:16,089 --> 00:02:21,640
They say when you die
you see something like a movie.

15
00:02:21,925 --> 00:02:25,185
A life kaleidoscoped
into a few seconds

16
00:02:25,922 --> 00:02:28,491
I look forward to that movie.

17
00:02:28,809 --> 00:02:33,957
A man's last movie. I definitely
don't want it interrupted.

18
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,301
"Darling, don't die!" and tears...

19
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,879
I can do without that.

20
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:45,129
Hey, our movie's starting.

21
00:02:48,808 --> 00:02:50,255
Tsutomu Yamazaki

22
00:02:50,355 --> 00:02:51,854
Nobuko Miyamoto

23
00:02:51,954 --> 00:02:53,416
Koji Yakusho

24
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:05,192
in Juzo Itami's

25
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:20,569
TAMPOPO
("DANDELION")

26
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,689
One fine day...

27
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:32,974
I went out with an old man.

28
00:03:34,462 --> 00:03:36,730
He's studied noodles for 40 years.

29
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:41,496
He was showing me the right way
to eat them.

30
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:46,993
Master...

31
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:50,640
soup first or noodles first?

32
00:03:51,201 --> 00:03:54,676
First, observe the whole bowl.

33
00:03:54,972 --> 00:03:55,996
Yes, sir.

34
00:03:56,096 --> 00:04:02,963
Appreciate its gestalt.
Savor the aromas.

35
00:04:03,138 --> 00:04:07,848
Jewels of fat glittering
on the surface.

36
00:04:08,126 --> 00:04:10,857
Shinachiku roots shining.

37
00:04:10,957 --> 00:04:14,655
Seaweed slowly sinking.

38
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:18,803
Spring onions floating.

39
00:04:18,903 --> 00:04:22,839
Concentrate on
the three pork slices...

40
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:28,546
They play the key role,
but stay modestly hidden.

41
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:33,304
First caress the surface...

42
00:04:34,345 --> 00:04:40,443
with the chopstick tips.

43
00:04:42,086 --> 00:04:43,610
What for?

44
00:04:44,088 --> 00:04:47,353
To express affection.

45
00:04:47,425 --> 00:04:49,231
I see.

46
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:53,235
Then poke the pork.

47
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,162
Eat the pork first?

48
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:58,794
No. Just touch it.

49
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,964
Caress it with the chopstick tips.

50
00:05:02,748 --> 00:05:04,496
Gently pick it up...

51
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:09,093
and dip it into the soup
on the right of the bowl.

52
00:05:09,917 --> 00:05:13,644
What's important here is to...

53
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:18,512
apologize to the pork by saying...

54
00:05:18,612 --> 00:05:20,409
"See you soon."

55
00:05:20,996 --> 00:05:23,370
"See you soon"?
What a fool.

56
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,801
What a book!

57
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:27,589
Makes me hungry for noodles.

58
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:30,727
Hang on.
Only two more hours.

59
00:05:31,234 --> 00:05:33,383
Let's finish and then eat.

60
00:05:33,483 --> 00:05:34,866
Shall we?

61
00:05:35,238 --> 00:05:37,102
Keep reading.

62
00:05:37,275 --> 00:05:41,836
Finally start eating,
the noodles first.

63
00:05:49,187 --> 00:05:51,654
Oh, at this time...

64
00:05:51,754 --> 00:05:57,811
while slurping the noodles,
look at the pork.

65
00:05:58,109 --> 00:05:59,179
Yes.

66
00:06:01,693 --> 00:06:04,596
Eye it affectionately.

67
00:06:07,276 --> 00:06:12,597
The old man bit some Shinachiku root
and chewed it awhile.

68
00:06:13,152 --> 00:06:16,237
Then he took some noodles.

69
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:23,144
Still chewing noodles,
he took some more Shinachiku.

70
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,489
Then he sipped some soup.

71
00:06:31,614 --> 00:06:33,675
Three times.

72
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:36,261
He sat up...

73
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,733
sighed, picked up...

74
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:44,576
one slice of pork as if making
a major decision in life...

75
00:06:44,577 --> 00:06:48,775
and lightly tapped it
on the side of the bowl.

76
00:06:48,847 --> 00:06:50,712
What for?

77
00:06:51,582 --> 00:06:54,595
To drain it. That's all.

78
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:01,883
Let's stop.

79
00:07:01,983 --> 00:07:03,271
Why?

80
00:07:04,206 --> 00:07:07,854
Your foolish book
is making me hungry.

81
00:07:07,901 --> 00:07:10,495
"Lai Lai Noodle Restaurant"

82
00:07:12,604 --> 00:07:15,518
Looks like a naruto and noritype.

83
00:07:15,618 --> 00:07:17,204
Yeah, shoyu-flavored.

84
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:18,655
Kind of light.

85
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,897
Hey, what's this?

86
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:36,359
You okay?

87
00:07:38,021 --> 00:07:39,393
Do you live here?

88
00:07:41,668 --> 00:07:42,868
Cheer up.

89
00:08:04,698 --> 00:08:05,990
Welcome.

90
00:08:11,098 --> 00:08:12,667
Pork in mine.

91
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:14,391
Special for me.

92
00:08:14,491 --> 00:08:15,575
OK.

93
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,939
That's a bad sign.

94
00:08:18,369 --> 00:08:19,519
Huh?

95
00:08:19,803 --> 00:08:21,573
It's not boiling.

96
00:08:30,225 --> 00:08:33,313
Hey, kid, you'll catch cold.

97
00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:36,426
Oh, you're home, Tabo.

98
00:08:36,569 --> 00:08:40,090
What's wrong? Got beat up again?

99
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:45,903
Who was it this time, Ryuta?

100
00:08:46,315 --> 00:08:50,764
You're soaked. Go dry and change.

101
00:08:51,305 --> 00:08:54,745
I'll say it again. Leave this dump.

102
00:08:55,165 --> 00:08:59,178
Move in with me.
That kid won't be bullied any more.

103
00:09:04,221 --> 00:09:06,695
Come with me to Paris.

104
00:09:06,941 --> 00:09:10,272
I'll buy you furs, jewelry, anything.

105
00:09:11,755 --> 00:09:13,487
You're so stubborn.

106
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:15,327
Pork for you.

107
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:17,679
Special for you.

108
00:09:18,321 --> 00:09:20,441
Special - like hell.

109
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:23,032
Why use smelly naruto?

110
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:28,165
You're out of date.
That's why business is bad.

111
00:09:28,265 --> 00:09:30,113
Why don't you quit?

112
00:09:30,213 --> 00:09:31,940
I'll help you.

113
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,634
Shut up.

114
00:09:33,753 --> 00:09:36,362
What I do is my business.

115
00:09:36,465 --> 00:09:38,213
My shop has nothing to do with you.

116
00:09:38,313 --> 00:09:41,380
I'm just trying to be helpful.

117
00:09:41,757 --> 00:09:44,149
I'm offering to buy you out
of this crummy shop.

118
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:47,689
Hey, you, be quiet.
We're trying to eat.

119
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:49,125
Stay out of this.

120
00:09:49,225 --> 00:09:51,298
Hey, Ken.
I'm sorry.

121
00:09:51,366 --> 00:09:55,769
Stop it, Pisken.
Leave my customers alone.

122
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,873
Customer!

123
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:00,965
You don't need smelly truck drivers.

124
00:10:01,042 --> 00:10:02,657
- Stop it!
- Shut up!

125
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:07,800
Hey, man.

126
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,922
If you want to fight, try me.

127
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:21,954
Okay, I think I will.

128
00:10:26,774 --> 00:10:28,553
Take the truck, Gun.

129
00:10:28,653 --> 00:10:29,653
But...

130
00:10:29,753 --> 00:10:33,105
I'm okay. Go ahead.
They're waiting.

131
00:10:35,477 --> 00:10:37,069
Okay. Good luck.

132
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,155
Let's go outside.

133
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:55,187
Good morning.

134
00:11:56,313 --> 00:11:57,661
Morning.

135
00:11:58,248 --> 00:11:59,596
Ouch.

136
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,483
- Are you okay?
- I think so.

137
00:12:02,626 --> 00:12:04,310
How did I end up here?

138
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:06,551
Don't you remember?

139
00:12:06,702 --> 00:12:08,798
I tried to put you to bed.

140
00:12:08,898 --> 00:12:11,055
But you wouldn't move.

141
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:52,858
You fight good.

142
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,650
No. I got beaten up.

143
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,291
That's okay.

144
00:12:57,391 --> 00:12:59,921
There were five of them.
That's not fair.

145
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,795
- Do you win?
- No, not me.

146
00:13:02,895 --> 00:13:04,195
Do you lose?

147
00:13:04,295 --> 00:13:06,339
Always. There are three of them.

148
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:09,064
Ryuta, Yohei and Uchida.

149
00:13:09,175 --> 00:13:11,042
Three? That's not fair.

150
00:13:11,142 --> 00:13:12,305
But I don't run.

151
00:13:12,405 --> 00:13:14,853
A man should never run,
my dad used to say.

152
00:13:14,953 --> 00:13:16,387
Your dad was tough.

153
00:13:16,487 --> 00:13:18,346
Yes, and Mom is great too.

154
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:22,913
She's a good cook.

155
00:13:23,013 --> 00:13:26,982
Yes. Haven't had
such good pickles in years.

156
00:13:27,082 --> 00:13:29,381
The best pickles in Japan.

157
00:13:29,492 --> 00:13:31,913
Her noodles too.

158
00:13:32,157 --> 00:13:36,146
Her noodles?
Her noodles are, well...

159
00:13:36,246 --> 00:13:37,505
I've got to go.

160
00:13:37,605 --> 00:13:39,583
- Got your notebook?
- Yes.

161
00:13:39,683 --> 00:13:41,081
- Pen?
- Yes.

162
00:13:41,181 --> 00:13:43,056
Is the denominator top or bottom?

163
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,784
Top, of course.
I know more math than you do.

164
00:13:45,884 --> 00:13:47,082
Or is it?

165
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:49,473
No. It's the bottom one. Bye.

166
00:13:49,474 --> 00:13:50,907
Leave his hat!

167
00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:01,379
Were my noodles that bad?

168
00:14:01,452 --> 00:14:04,080
No, I didn't mean that.

169
00:14:04,155 --> 00:14:06,550
Please. Be honest.

170
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:10,660
Since my husband died,
I've been trying so hard.

171
00:14:10,661 --> 00:14:14,964
But I'm not confident. I'm never sure.

172
00:14:15,693 --> 00:14:18,294
Please tell me the truth.

173
00:14:20,538 --> 00:14:22,739
Oh, I haven't even told you my name.

174
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,709
I'm Tampopo.

175
00:14:25,777 --> 00:14:28,008
- I'm Goro.
- My name is Gun.

176
00:14:28,627 --> 00:14:31,736
So, how are my noodles?

177
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,789
Well...

178
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:40,990
They've got sincerity,
but they lack guts, they're...

179
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,854
Frankly, they're bad.

180
00:14:44,036 --> 00:14:45,910
Uh, Miss Tampopo.

181
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,655
- No. Just Tampopo.
- Okay, Tampopo.

182
00:14:47,755 --> 00:14:49,127
Go make noodles.

183
00:14:49,246 --> 00:14:51,149
- Gun, you're the customer.
- Okay.

184
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,265
No. Come in the door.

185
00:14:53,338 --> 00:14:55,338
Okay? We'll give it a try.

186
00:14:55,741 --> 00:14:59,541
Ready? Go!

187
00:15:01,117 --> 00:15:03,274
- Welcome!
- Stop!

188
00:15:03,348 --> 00:15:05,349
If you say "welcome," look at him.

189
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,219
- If not, just keep working.
- Yes, sir.

190
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,419
Carry on.

191
00:15:09,121 --> 00:15:11,093
Plain noodles.

192
00:15:11,193 --> 00:15:16,613
Now, look at the customer
while he's not looking.

193
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,269
Wait a minute.

194
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,666
What did you see?

195
00:15:22,766 --> 00:15:27,138
- He's young and cute...
- No, no. That's not the point.

196
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:29,937
Is he in a hurry? Is he hungry?

197
00:15:30,008 --> 00:15:31,771
Is he a new customer?

198
00:15:31,844 --> 00:15:33,368
Is he drunk?

199
00:15:33,445 --> 00:15:36,462
- Is he a customer you want?
- I see.

200
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:38,175
Now take care of the noodles.

201
00:15:45,748 --> 00:15:48,059
Cutting the pork there is good.

202
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,894
That's how my husband did it.

203
00:15:49,895 --> 00:15:52,131
- The slices are too thick.
- But thicker is better.

204
00:15:52,132 --> 00:15:53,792
No, not at all.

205
00:15:53,866 --> 00:15:56,002
- Three 3mm slices are best.
- OK.

206
00:15:58,405 --> 00:16:01,602
- No. That's too thin.
- I see.

207
00:16:10,664 --> 00:16:13,655
Now, quick,
look at the customer!

208
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:18,254
Don't you want to see
how he reacts?

209
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,697
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

210
00:16:19,797 --> 00:16:21,694
- What's he doing?
- Sipping soup.

211
00:16:21,794 --> 00:16:23,523
Isn't that strange?

212
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:27,971
- Well...
- It's very strange.

213
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:33,131
How could he sip the soup?
It's supposed to be boiling hot.

214
00:16:33,206 --> 00:16:34,220
I see.

215
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,830
- A fatal flaw!
- Yes, sir.

216
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,380
- The soup must be hot.
- Yes, sir.

217
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:44,220
Wait. Wait, please...

218
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,213
Please...

219
00:16:46,286 --> 00:16:47,981
Please be my teacher.

220
00:16:48,054 --> 00:16:49,129
Teacher?

221
00:16:49,229 --> 00:16:52,591
Please. I'll be a good student.

222
00:16:52,659 --> 00:16:57,961
Meeting you makes me want
to be a real noodle cook.

223
00:16:58,498 --> 00:17:01,592
For my son too.

224
00:17:01,668 --> 00:17:05,502
I'll do anything.
So please, please teach me.

225
00:17:05,872 --> 00:17:08,304
Teach you? But we're...

226
00:17:08,404 --> 00:17:10,573
Only when you're free.

227
00:17:10,973 --> 00:17:14,478
I'll keep pickles ready for you.

228
00:17:15,982 --> 00:17:18,348
One, two!

229
00:17:18,418 --> 00:17:20,147
"Closed Today"

230
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:23,584
One, two!

231
00:17:23,684 --> 00:17:24,684
Come on!

232
00:17:24,784 --> 00:17:26,707
Don't be such a weakling.

233
00:17:26,807 --> 00:17:30,370
One, two!

234
00:17:31,631 --> 00:17:36,794
One, two!

235
00:17:39,379 --> 00:17:41,241
Okay, ladle the noodles out.

236
00:17:41,242 --> 00:17:43,039
Into six bowls.

237
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,907
Get set. Go!

238
00:17:48,705 --> 00:17:50,386
Faster.

239
00:17:54,954 --> 00:17:56,852
What's that? Put it back.

240
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:59,514
- Keep going.
- Yes, sir.

241
00:17:59,863 --> 00:18:02,622
Get set! Go!

242
00:18:06,302 --> 00:18:08,657
Get set! Go!

243
00:18:34,303 --> 00:18:37,558
Almost there!
3 minutes 15 seconds.

244
00:18:37,631 --> 00:18:39,711
- You have to beat 3 minutes.
- Yes, sir.

245
00:18:43,978 --> 00:18:46,294
Come on!
It takes muscles!

246
00:18:46,394 --> 00:18:47,833
Don't give up!

247
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:50,210
You must be better than a man.

248
00:18:50,211 --> 00:18:51,803
Go! Go! Go!

249
00:18:51,903 --> 00:18:52,903
Yes, sir!

250
00:18:53,003 --> 00:18:56,730
Okay, now some
stretching exercises.

251
00:19:08,403 --> 00:19:10,255
Why am I doing this?

252
00:19:49,835 --> 00:19:52,693
This place is famous for seafood.

253
00:20:38,418 --> 00:20:40,020
Your order, sir?

254
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,594
What would you like, sir?

255
00:20:46,595 --> 00:20:48,460
Just a moment.

256
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:51,632
And you, sir?

257
00:20:52,581 --> 00:20:57,109
I'm not too hungry.
Something light.

258
00:20:58,973 --> 00:21:00,353
Let me see...

259
00:21:03,033 --> 00:21:06,181
Sole meunière, please.

260
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,243
Some soup or salad, sir?

261
00:21:08,378 --> 00:21:10,879
Consommé. No salad.

262
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:13,012
- A drink, sir?
- Beer.

263
00:21:13,112 --> 00:21:15,713
- Heineken.
- Yes, sir.

264
00:21:20,027 --> 00:21:21,442
And you, sir?

265
00:21:21,542 --> 00:21:23,532
I'll have sole, too.

266
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,707
Soup or a salad, sir?

267
00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:29,729
Consommé. No salad.

268
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:33,017
- Something to drink, sir?
- Beer too.

269
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,512
And you, sir?

270
00:21:38,782 --> 00:21:40,282
Well...

271
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,551
Maybe I'll try the sole, too.

272
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,687
- Soup or salad, sir?
- Well...

273
00:21:44,688 --> 00:21:46,315
Maybe Consommé.

274
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:48,845
- A drink, sir?
- Well...

275
00:21:49,192 --> 00:21:51,581
Maybe a beer.

276
00:21:56,078 --> 00:21:57,580
Same for me.

277
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,234
Me, too.

278
00:22:07,362 --> 00:22:08,610
Sir?

279
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:13,976
- And you, sir?
- One moment.

280
00:22:21,639 --> 00:22:23,746
So you have quenelle.

281
00:22:25,483 --> 00:22:29,059
Boudin style...

282
00:22:29,366 --> 00:22:32,821
That's quenelle prepared
in the shape of sausage?

283
00:22:32,921 --> 00:22:34,333
Yes, sir.

284
00:22:35,173 --> 00:22:39,938
I think Taille-Vent in France
serves this.

285
00:22:40,011 --> 00:22:41,672
You're well-informed.

286
00:22:41,746 --> 00:22:44,610
Our chef trained at Taille-Vent.

287
00:22:45,863 --> 00:22:47,810
Then it's served with caviar sauce?

288
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,202
That's correct, sir.

289
00:22:50,225 --> 00:22:54,975
And the escargots wrapped in pastry.

290
00:22:55,657 --> 00:22:57,957
In fond-de-veau?

291
00:22:58,057 --> 00:23:01,631
Yes. Escargots and mushrooms
simmered in Madeira.

292
00:23:01,731 --> 00:23:05,030
And then stewed in fond-de-veau, sir.

293
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:07,084
Yes. I'll have that.

294
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,120
And apple-and-walnut salad.

295
00:23:12,286 --> 00:23:13,896
A perfect match, sir.

296
00:23:14,562 --> 00:23:16,378
A drink, sir?

297
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:18,036
Yes.

298
00:23:18,136 --> 00:23:24,245
I think I feel like
some Corton Charlemagne.

299
00:23:24,808 --> 00:23:26,183
Do you have a 1981?

300
00:23:26,283 --> 00:23:28,516
I'll call the sommelier.

301
00:23:29,526 --> 00:23:30,867
Thank you.

302
00:24:07,433 --> 00:24:11,733
Today we learn
how to eat Spaghetti.

303
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:18,770
You use grated cheese
only on certain spaghetti dishes.

304
00:24:18,844 --> 00:24:23,816
This is spaghetti alle vongole.
So...?

305
00:24:24,871 --> 00:24:27,456
That's right, no cheese.

306
00:24:27,556 --> 00:24:30,446
Fork and spoon, everybody.

307
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:35,220
Spoon in your left hand.

308
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:41,540
Catch three or four strings
of spaghetti with your fork...

309
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,748
and gently turn it around
on your spoon.

310
00:24:43,848 --> 00:24:47,987
You wind your spaghetti like this.

311
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,270
And then you have do
eat them how?

312
00:24:51,897 --> 00:24:57,710
Right. You must not make
the slightest noise.

313
00:25:08,082 --> 00:25:13,356
Remember: It's important
not to make any noise!

314
00:25:18,812 --> 00:25:21,349
No noise, whatsoever!

315
00:25:21,778 --> 00:25:28,320
Listen carefully to hear
if you make any noise.

316
00:25:29,089 --> 00:25:35,211
Sometimes people
don't know they make noise.

317
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,514
Let's try it.

318
00:25:37,614 --> 00:25:39,604
Listen carefully.

319
00:25:41,561 --> 00:25:45,877
Even a very faint noise...

320
00:25:53,189 --> 00:25:58,639
...like this is taboo abroad.

321
00:29:14,329 --> 00:29:17,205
This shop is so near to yours...

322
00:29:17,446 --> 00:29:19,437
but look at the queue.

323
00:29:20,015 --> 00:29:23,117
If your noodles are good, you'll get
all the customers you want.

324
00:29:23,118 --> 00:29:24,847
That's right.

325
00:29:25,187 --> 00:29:27,247
This place is not so great.

326
00:29:27,548 --> 00:29:30,102
You've eaten here before?

327
00:29:30,245 --> 00:29:32,655
No, I can just tell.

328
00:29:32,996 --> 00:29:38,305
See? Too much wasted motion.

329
00:29:38,405 --> 00:29:42,640
And they talk too much.
Only their "welcome" has clout.

330
00:29:42,838 --> 00:29:45,161
Who ordered pork
and wonton dumplings?

331
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:48,186
See? They can't remember
who ordered what.

332
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,570
You can beat them in a month.

333
00:29:51,981 --> 00:29:53,670
Tampopo, look.

334
00:29:58,214 --> 00:29:59,745
Watch closely.

335
00:30:00,459 --> 00:30:03,155
See how he changes the water.

336
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:06,091
See how they switch positions?

337
00:30:06,161 --> 00:30:07,822
No wasted motion.

338
00:30:09,404 --> 00:30:11,307
And they're quiet too.

339
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,844
This is a good place.

340
00:30:15,177 --> 00:30:17,278
Their customers feel good too.

341
00:30:17,572 --> 00:30:22,671
See? They keep on drinking
right down to the last drop.

342
00:30:24,313 --> 00:30:28,745
Look, when they return their bowls.

343
00:30:28,985 --> 00:30:33,216
Watch closely. The old man looks at
every empty bowl...

344
00:30:34,336 --> 00:30:37,540
to see if the soup is finished.

345
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,640
See?

346
00:30:39,459 --> 00:30:41,698
It's the soup that animates the noodles.

347
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:45,134
That's why he checks so carefully.

348
00:30:45,938 --> 00:30:53,067
He remembers exactly who orders
what and when.

349
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:54,677
Am I right?

350
00:30:54,777 --> 00:30:56,580
Yes.
That's part of being good.

351
00:30:57,992 --> 00:31:00,656
Another train just arrived.
Watch...

352
00:31:05,121 --> 00:31:06,554
With pork.

353
00:31:08,959 --> 00:31:11,354
Plain noodles.
No bean sprouts.

354
00:31:13,321 --> 00:31:14,685
With dumplings.

355
00:31:15,755 --> 00:31:18,388
Extra noodles.

356
00:31:19,221 --> 00:31:21,259
Shinachiku noodles, please.

357
00:31:21,409 --> 00:31:22,908
Garlic noodles.

358
00:31:23,154 --> 00:31:25,604
I want soft noodles.

359
00:31:26,794 --> 00:31:28,769
How much?

360
00:31:29,371 --> 00:31:31,187
480 yen.

361
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,414
Thanks.

362
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:38,713
Great, isn't he?

363
00:31:38,943 --> 00:31:42,123
See?
He knows exactly who ordered what.

364
00:31:42,223 --> 00:31:43,792
I want fatty pork in mine.

365
00:31:44,562 --> 00:31:46,291
Here's my money.

366
00:31:53,606 --> 00:31:56,072
Plain, with firm noodles.

367
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,678
Plain but no Shinachiku.

368
00:32:02,892 --> 00:32:09,754
I can remember.
That guy ordered the pork noodles.

369
00:32:09,854 --> 00:32:12,253
And that guy gets straight noodles,
without bean sprouts.

370
00:32:12,353 --> 00:32:15,345
And he gets the large noodles, but...

371
00:32:15,445 --> 00:32:16,913
- Uh...
- What?

372
00:32:17,024 --> 00:32:20,679
The dumplings guy gets served
before Mr. Big Noodles.

373
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,510
- Is that right?
- Yes.

374
00:32:23,717 --> 00:32:26,008
With dumplings.

375
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:27,494
Large noodles.

376
00:32:27,594 --> 00:32:28,594
Shinachiku noodles.

377
00:32:28,694 --> 00:32:29,699
Garlic noodles.

378
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:32,609
Soft noodles.
Fatty pork.

379
00:32:32,709 --> 00:32:33,962
Firm noodles.

380
00:32:34,062 --> 00:32:35,438
No Shinachiku.

381
00:32:53,613 --> 00:32:55,136
This is it.

382
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:58,554
This is it!

383
00:32:59,267 --> 00:33:01,147
Excuse me.

384
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:02,979
Excuse me.

385
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:04,818
Excuse me, please!

386
00:33:05,429 --> 00:33:09,440
Please,
tell me your soup recipe.

387
00:33:09,514 --> 00:33:12,483
How to make my soup?
Never!

388
00:33:12,884 --> 00:33:16,487
You're a professional.
I can tell by your eyes.

389
00:33:16,488 --> 00:33:19,675
I don't tell competitors my secrets.

390
00:33:19,775 --> 00:33:23,764
Please. I'll pay you for it.

391
00:33:24,113 --> 00:33:25,543
How much?

392
00:33:25,643 --> 00:33:26,643
Uh...

393
00:33:26,888 --> 00:33:27,954
50,000 yen or so.

394
00:33:28,054 --> 00:33:29,362
Never!

395
00:33:29,568 --> 00:33:33,370
If you want to pay money,
you loan me one million yen...

396
00:33:33,371 --> 00:33:35,506
to be paid back in a year,
no interest...

397
00:33:35,507 --> 00:33:40,163
then I'll tell you
the secret of my soup free.

398
00:33:41,194 --> 00:33:42,820
One million yen...

399
00:33:47,728 --> 00:33:49,568
Don't lend him anything.

400
00:33:50,464 --> 00:33:54,809
He's crazy about the horses.
You'll never get it back.

401
00:33:55,413 --> 00:34:02,526
You give me 30,000 yen.
I give you the secret of his soup.

402
00:34:02,732 --> 00:34:05,341
My shop is next door.

403
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:09,679
Tonight come back with the money.

404
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,987
Hello.

405
00:34:36,055 --> 00:34:37,967
Come this way.

406
00:34:38,196 --> 00:34:41,097
- Where to?
- This way. This way.

407
00:34:43,319 --> 00:34:44,944
Where are we going?

408
00:34:45,044 --> 00:34:46,477
There, there.

409
00:34:48,381 --> 00:34:50,178
What's happening?

410
00:34:50,249 --> 00:34:52,954
You can't learn soup-making here.

411
00:35:01,963 --> 00:35:04,420
Look through here.

412
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:10,550
How much?

413
00:36:13,635 --> 00:36:17,664
Hey, why didn't you finish it?

414
00:36:17,738 --> 00:36:19,535
Sorry, but I'm full.

415
00:36:19,606 --> 00:36:24,428
What? Why did you order it
if you're not hungry, you jerks?

416
00:36:26,413 --> 00:36:29,892
You're from Lai Lai, aren't you?

417
00:36:29,992 --> 00:36:35,546
Why did you come here? To steal
our secrets, you lousy bastards!

418
00:36:38,617 --> 00:36:41,835
We've been in this business
for 40 years.

419
00:36:41,935 --> 00:36:47,029
We don't need comments from beginners.

420
00:36:47,727 --> 00:36:50,042
Apologize right now.

421
00:36:50,142 --> 00:36:54,190
Or finish every drop of our soup
before you go.

422
00:36:55,863 --> 00:36:59,360
Now we can't leave
without a last word, can we?

423
00:36:59,647 --> 00:37:03,833
I didn't finish the soup
because I couldn't. It stinks!

424
00:37:03,933 --> 00:37:04,764
What?

425
00:37:04,864 --> 00:37:06,245
How dare you!

426
00:37:06,426 --> 00:37:09,628
The soup tastes like
overcooked pork bones.

427
00:37:09,991 --> 00:37:14,529
The vegetables you use to hide
the pork stink are too sweet.

428
00:37:14,935 --> 00:37:17,068
The kombu is too strong.

429
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:20,637
Yeah, and you use
dried seguro sardines.

430
00:37:20,737 --> 00:37:23,865
Those fish are not fit to eat.
Their innards stink.

431
00:37:24,245 --> 00:37:25,696
How dare you!

432
00:37:25,804 --> 00:37:29,405
You stupid amateurs could never
appreciate my noodles!

433
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:32,900
But people who eat noodles
are all amateurs.

434
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,200
So why make noodles amateurs
can't appreciate?

435
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:40,814
She's right. You let the dough sit
too long. It smells like soda.

436
00:37:40,914 --> 00:37:43,598
After it rains, go easy on the soda.

437
00:37:43,698 --> 00:37:46,188
That's right. And the overcooked
pork is like cardboard.

438
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:51,049
The Shinachiku aren't pickled.
So they're soggy and bland.

439
00:37:53,491 --> 00:37:58,142
You goddamn big mouths!
You think you make better noodles!

440
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:01,583
We just make normal noodles
in a normal way.

441
00:38:01,683 --> 00:38:05,918
Okay. We'll come try
your normal noodles.

442
00:38:06,299 --> 00:38:09,241
We'll be there in the morning.

443
00:38:09,867 --> 00:38:12,405
It'd better be good, or else...

444
00:38:19,094 --> 00:38:21,696
The pork is okay.
Is the water boiling?

445
00:38:21,697 --> 00:38:22,730
Boiling.

446
00:38:22,731 --> 00:38:24,028
How's the soup?

447
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:28,369
- Oh, God!
- What's wrong?

448
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:29,770
I let the soup boil.

449
00:38:29,771 --> 00:38:32,463
- It's not clear.
- What can we do?

450
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:37,987
- They're coming.
- Mom, they're here!

451
00:38:43,729 --> 00:38:49,830
Okay, let's have some of
your normal noodles.

452
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:51,937
- Wait a minute.
- Wait?

453
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:55,397
It won't take long.

454
00:38:55,497 --> 00:38:58,450
No, we want it now.
A promise is a promise.

455
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,937
Get moving.

456
00:39:02,166 --> 00:39:04,163
What's that smell?

457
00:39:06,662 --> 00:39:07,662
Hey!

458
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,383
Let me see the soup!

459
00:39:09,483 --> 00:39:12,420
Wait!
Please, wait a minute!

460
00:39:13,126 --> 00:39:15,227
Leave my mom alone!

461
00:39:21,127 --> 00:39:23,714
Don't! Stop it!

462
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,025
Goro!

463
00:39:30,295 --> 00:39:31,571
Help!

464
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:33,863
Goro, help!

465
00:39:50,731 --> 00:39:52,055
Oh, damn it!

466
00:40:11,698 --> 00:40:13,942
"Closed Today"

467
00:40:14,444 --> 00:40:16,810
Closed again, eh?

468
00:40:17,772 --> 00:40:20,461
It's not good for business.

469
00:40:25,163 --> 00:40:28,113
So you still can't get the soup right.

470
00:40:28,819 --> 00:40:31,603
We'll just have to ask the old master.

471
00:40:33,419 --> 00:40:36,958
Goro, we're over here!
Come join us.

472
00:40:37,058 --> 00:40:38,533
There they are.

473
00:40:40,262 --> 00:40:41,587
Come on.

474
00:40:44,394 --> 00:40:48,313
Hello, hello.

475
00:40:49,749 --> 00:40:51,741
Come on.

476
00:40:53,355 --> 00:40:54,355
Hey!

477
00:40:56,424 --> 00:40:58,153
Come here.

478
00:41:01,785 --> 00:41:03,656
Come here.

479
00:41:04,949 --> 00:41:07,280
Come share our meal.

480
00:41:10,405 --> 00:41:14,489
This is our master.
He was a doctor.

481
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:17,021
While he was selling
noodles for fun...

482
00:41:17,121 --> 00:41:19,596
...his partner stole his wife
and practice.

483
00:41:20,992 --> 00:41:23,355
Now he's our resident gourmet.

484
00:41:24,528 --> 00:41:26,883
Nice to meet you.

485
00:41:26,954 --> 00:41:28,785
You came just in time.

486
00:41:28,856 --> 00:41:33,471
We just got our hands on some of
Carlton's boeuf bourgignon.

487
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:37,464
It's slightly burnt,
so you can't call it perfect.

488
00:41:37,465 --> 00:41:41,401
French cooking is a constant battle
with burns.

489
00:41:42,768 --> 00:41:44,937
Ummm. Good.

490
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:49,714
How's the sake?
Pretty good, isn't it?

491
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:54,373
Yeah. But what is it?
I can't tell the brand.

492
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:59,778
No, you can't. It's a blend.

493
00:41:59,878 --> 00:42:03,878
The base is a semi-dry Nada.

494
00:42:03,978 --> 00:42:06,431
But we blended it quite a bit.

495
00:42:06,531 --> 00:42:09,231
He's been studying this for 15 years.

496
00:42:10,555 --> 00:42:16,585
It's a pork cutlet from Kitaro.
But I can't recommend it.

497
00:42:16,685 --> 00:42:19,032
Their quality has gone down.

498
00:42:19,132 --> 00:42:22,696
They used to use good pork
from Kagoshima. But not now.

499
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:27,299
Now they even use machines
to shred cabbage.

500
00:42:27,399 --> 00:42:29,492
No more soul in their food.

501
00:42:29,627 --> 00:42:31,966
It used to be good, though.

502
00:42:32,601 --> 00:42:34,599
They tend to be fussy.

503
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,381
What's the story about this wine?

504
00:42:40,023 --> 00:42:42,608
You mean this Medoc,
a 1980 Chateau Pichon Lalande.

505
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:52,248
The weather was bad in 1980...

506
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:56,200
and it was a bad year for Bordeaux.

507
00:42:56,447 --> 00:43:00,348
The other day I was in the alley
behind Chat Qui Peche...

508
00:43:00,349 --> 00:43:02,783
and found some empty bottles...

509
00:43:02,851 --> 00:43:08,023
including this particular
Chateau Pichon Lalande.

510
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:11,783
There was still 5cm left.

511
00:43:11,883 --> 00:43:16,363
So I brought it home and decanted it.

512
00:43:16,478 --> 00:43:20,832
They say that 1980 is
a bad year for the Médoc...

513
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:24,242
But no. A pleasant surprise!

514
00:43:24,591 --> 00:43:28,809
It was a bit light.
But such a firm flavor!

515
00:43:28,909 --> 00:43:33,600
The tail that trailed down
my throat was... endless!

516
00:43:36,478 --> 00:43:39,777
They live deeply,
these vagabonds.

517
00:43:40,395 --> 00:43:44,448
You're not eating much, sonny.
Can I fix you something?

518
00:43:44,654 --> 00:43:46,188
What do you want?

519
00:43:46,295 --> 00:43:49,431
- A rice omelet.
- Rice omelet? Hmm.

520
00:43:49,432 --> 00:43:51,423
Okay, follow me.

521
00:46:30,299 --> 00:46:32,725
We want to borrow your master
for a while.

522
00:46:32,825 --> 00:46:34,291
So long.

523
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:36,667
I'm so grateful, master.

524
00:46:37,095 --> 00:46:38,332
Good luck!

525
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:42,068
Why don't we sing our master off.

526
00:46:47,872 --> 00:46:57,124
# How precious #

527
00:46:57,323 --> 00:47:06,647
# Our teacher's teachings #

528
00:47:07,078 --> 00:47:16,733
# Time flies swiftly #

529
00:47:17,032 --> 00:47:26,422
# In this garden of learning #

530
00:47:27,086 --> 00:47:37,604
# So swiftly #

531
00:47:37,936 --> 00:47:48,056
# After all these years #

532
00:47:48,918 --> 00:48:02,887
# We must part #

533
00:48:03,827 --> 00:48:11,456
# Goodbye #

534
00:50:01,129 --> 00:50:02,707
What did you catch?

535
00:50:03,255 --> 00:50:04,523
Oysters.

536
00:50:04,623 --> 00:50:05,536
Wait.

537
00:50:05,636 --> 00:50:06,799
Let me see.

538
00:50:19,781 --> 00:50:21,494
Sell me one.

539
00:50:22,366 --> 00:50:23,532
Sure.

540
00:50:24,595 --> 00:50:25,943
Shall I open it?

541
00:50:52,897 --> 00:50:53,968
Ouch!

542
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:16,683
Here, let me help.

543
00:51:23,999 --> 00:51:25,665
It tickles.

544
00:52:50,993 --> 00:52:52,169
Anesthetic.

545
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:06,274
God, what a huge abscess.

546
00:54:06,374 --> 00:54:09,351
What a stink.
Didn't you smell it?

547
00:54:09,451 --> 00:54:10,260
Uh?

548
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:11,939
A little bit.

549
00:54:12,039 --> 00:54:14,628
Whew!
I thought I'd vomit.

550
00:54:15,584 --> 00:54:17,212
You can eat anything now.

551
00:54:17,312 --> 00:54:19,573
But start with something soft.

552
00:54:33,355 --> 00:54:36,162
"I only eat natural food."

553
00:54:39,923 --> 00:54:42,827
"Do not give me sweets or snacks."

554
00:54:42,927 --> 00:54:45,084
"A message from my mother."

555
00:54:51,983 --> 00:54:53,886
Do you want this?
OK.

556
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:03,204
It's good.

557
00:55:04,227 --> 00:55:05,433
Here.

558
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,376
Listen carefully.

559
00:55:30,476 --> 00:55:33,271
Noodles are synergetic things.

560
00:55:33,459 --> 00:55:38,271
Every step is crucial
for the final result.

561
00:55:38,371 --> 00:55:40,539
Don't forget that.

562
00:55:40,658 --> 00:55:44,909
Well, let's review
the basic rules of soup.

563
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:50,761
Fowl spoils quickly.
So use only the freshest chicken.

564
00:55:51,134 --> 00:55:55,332
Both chicken and pork have strong
smells. So parboil them first.

565
00:55:55,432 --> 00:55:59,310
Then rinse them well in cold water.

566
00:56:00,468 --> 00:56:04,520
Don't cut the vegetables.

567
00:56:05,162 --> 00:56:07,676
The difficulty is
to control the heat.

568
00:56:07,938 --> 00:56:10,999
Heat releases the soul
of the ingredients.

569
00:56:11,277 --> 00:56:16,249
But never allow it to come
to a full boil like that.

570
00:56:16,939 --> 00:56:20,152
If you boil it,
the soup will never clear.

571
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:25,464
And keep skimming the scum off.

572
00:56:28,882 --> 00:56:33,286
Today I have
a most interesting addition.

573
00:56:33,386 --> 00:56:36,433
Isn't he beautiful?

574
00:56:37,145 --> 00:56:38,707
This is...

575
00:56:57,279 --> 00:57:02,935
Sorry. It's just the way
it looked at me.

576
00:57:03,124 --> 00:57:07,529
Here's your 14 servings
of mori noodles.

577
00:57:16,843 --> 00:57:18,694
Welcome!

578
00:57:18,794 --> 00:57:21,342
How nice to see you, sir.

579
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:23,528
Please, come this way.

580
00:57:43,013 --> 00:57:45,077
No shiroko, darling.

581
00:57:45,177 --> 00:57:47,615
Or kamonamban
or tempura soba either.

582
00:57:47,715 --> 00:57:50,709
They almost got you last time.

583
00:57:50,863 --> 00:57:52,685
I'm just going to the bank now.

584
00:57:52,785 --> 00:57:54,514
Come, Shohei.

585
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:15,256
One kamonamban here.

586
00:58:15,407 --> 00:58:17,802
One tempura soba here.

587
00:58:17,902 --> 00:58:21,179
And one shiruko.
All for you.

588
01:00:19,847 --> 01:00:21,575
Turn him upside down.

589
01:00:44,438 --> 01:00:46,793
Good, we've done it.

590
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:06,809
Today,
in thanks for saving my life...

591
01:01:07,048 --> 01:01:10,446
I'd like to treat you to
some delicacy.

592
01:01:10,531 --> 01:01:13,531
Thank you for coming.

593
01:01:14,693 --> 01:01:18,259
Just a touch more salt today,
Shohei.

594
01:01:18,359 --> 01:01:19,480
Yes, sir.

595
01:01:19,741 --> 01:01:21,189
Want to watch?

596
01:01:28,467 --> 01:01:30,558
Is it from Lake Hamana?

597
01:01:30,658 --> 01:01:34,440
No, from the Kuma River.
Finally I got a wild one.

598
01:01:35,419 --> 01:01:37,878
Watch out, ma'am!

599
01:01:37,947 --> 01:01:41,706
Be careful.
Suppon have teeth like razors.

600
01:01:42,279 --> 01:01:45,423
They can bite your finger clean off.

601
01:01:53,366 --> 01:01:56,957
See that?
Unless you kill it in one stroke...

602
01:01:57,057 --> 01:02:02,405
the muscles contract, the blood
congeals and it won't taste as good.

603
01:02:08,965 --> 01:02:16,791
Since my rescuer is having trouble,
I feel I must do something.

604
01:02:16,952 --> 01:02:20,813
Will you let this old man help?

605
01:02:20,913 --> 01:02:22,260
Shohei, come here!

606
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:26,004
Yes, sir.
Nothing special, but...

607
01:02:26,104 --> 01:02:29,097
please sample my noodles.

608
01:02:43,582 --> 01:02:46,099
Where did you acquire such skill?

609
01:02:46,199 --> 01:02:51,668
When I was young, an old man
at the local noodle stand taught me.

610
01:02:52,177 --> 01:02:56,977
What do you think?
If he'll be of use, take him.

611
01:02:57,576 --> 01:03:04,124
Today we start making Lai Lai
a "three-star" noodle joint.

612
01:03:05,298 --> 01:03:07,724
Master, you handle the soup.

613
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:14,402
Shohei, starting today,
you're responsible for the noodles.

614
01:03:15,445 --> 01:03:21,302
Gun and myself, we will take charge
of the atmosphere.

615
01:03:22,384 --> 01:03:23,850
Our philosophy of taste:

616
01:03:23,853 --> 01:03:26,903
with depth,
but clear and shoyu-flavored.

617
01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:33,149
We'll only add roast pork,
Shinachiku roots and spring onions.

618
01:03:33,249 --> 01:03:37,196
The menu will only offer
plain noodles and pork noodles.

619
01:03:37,466 --> 01:03:38,362
Agreed?

620
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:40,100
Agreed!

621
01:03:40,337 --> 01:03:43,996
What about a new name?

622
01:03:44,619 --> 01:03:48,354
Since the noodles will change,
maybe we should change the name.

623
01:03:48,454 --> 01:03:50,217
- Right.
- Let's change it.

624
01:03:51,169 --> 01:03:52,391
All right.

625
01:03:52,588 --> 01:03:55,554
Any good ideas?

626
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:58,671
- Something different.
- Easy to say.

627
01:03:58,771 --> 01:04:01,256
- Feminine too.
- And taste-tempting.

628
01:04:01,257 --> 01:04:02,457
Uh...

629
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:04,746
Why not call it...

630
01:04:04,846 --> 01:04:06,387
"Tampopo"?

631
01:04:06,879 --> 01:04:08,528
"Tampopo"!

632
01:04:08,628 --> 01:04:09,628
Yes!

633
01:04:09,728 --> 01:04:11,653
- Clever.
- Not bad at all.

634
01:04:12,565 --> 01:04:13,913
"Tampopo"...?

635
01:04:14,013 --> 01:04:16,466
Yes...
"Tampopo Noodles".

636
01:04:19,567 --> 01:04:21,089
"Tampopo Noodles"!

637
01:04:33,072 --> 01:04:35,883
"Tampopo"

638
01:04:46,569 --> 01:04:50,669
Take a look. Chicken, pork,
kombu and dried sardines.

639
01:04:50,828 --> 01:04:54,910
Unusual.
They use fish heads too.

640
01:05:29,828 --> 01:05:33,849
The noodles are superb.
So smooth, but with great body.

641
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:41,303
You're right.
Smooth but strong.

642
01:05:42,651 --> 01:05:45,078
Noodles can be so different.

643
01:05:48,409 --> 01:05:52,223
When you make noodles,
you must have a precise recipe.

644
01:05:52,370 --> 01:05:56,275
An exact combination of different
flours, kneadings, everything.

645
01:05:56,375 --> 01:06:04,388
To make noodles this smooth,
they must do an extra rolling.

646
01:06:04,488 --> 01:06:08,995
They probably let the dough sit
before they roll it.

647
01:06:09,095 --> 01:06:13,357
But the key question is
exactly how long.

648
01:06:13,539 --> 01:06:18,099
The soda water may be
a bit different too.

649
01:06:19,464 --> 01:06:20,648
I'll ask.

650
01:06:20,748 --> 01:06:22,696
They'll never tell you.

651
01:06:22,768 --> 01:06:24,531
It won't hurt to try.

652
01:06:26,901 --> 01:06:29,474
Say, did you make the noodles
I just had?

653
01:06:29,574 --> 01:06:30,742
Yes, I did.

654
01:06:30,842 --> 01:06:34,209
They weren't as good as usual.

655
01:06:34,546 --> 01:06:36,173
No good?

656
01:06:46,243 --> 01:06:48,487
They're the same as always.

657
01:06:49,145 --> 01:06:51,020
Maybe you didn't let the dough sit
long enough.

658
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:55,711
Nonsense! I kneaded it yesterday,
and let it sit overnight.

659
01:06:56,568 --> 01:06:59,859
Strange. Maybe you skipped a rolling.

660
01:06:59,959 --> 01:07:02,119
No. Three times, as usual.

661
01:07:02,219 --> 01:07:03,643
Did you change the soda water?

662
01:07:03,644 --> 01:07:07,055
No. I use the very best soda water,
the same as back home in Guangxi.

663
01:07:07,155 --> 01:07:11,020
No. 1 Chinese Spring Water
from Guangxi.

664
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:13,748
Really? Maybe it was just me.

665
01:07:13,848 --> 01:07:15,334
It must be.

666
01:07:15,434 --> 01:07:17,123
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.

667
01:07:50,976 --> 01:07:55,061
Hey, I hear you're hanging out
at Tampopo's place these days.

668
01:07:55,418 --> 01:07:57,273
Listen, big-mouth.

669
01:07:57,868 --> 01:08:01,072
It's none of your business
where I hang out.

670
01:08:01,172 --> 01:08:03,065
I guess not.

671
01:08:03,135 --> 01:08:04,602
Got a minute though?

672
01:08:07,788 --> 01:08:12,078
Last time I was drunk so I forgot
to stop my boys from helping.

673
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:14,570
Basically I'm a fair guy.

674
01:08:15,349 --> 01:08:19,802
I felt bad about it.
Probably worse than you did.

675
01:08:20,873 --> 01:08:23,094
What do you say?

676
01:08:23,672 --> 01:08:26,210
How about fighting
one-on-one now?

677
01:09:23,934 --> 01:09:26,268
Oh?
You changed the noodles.

678
01:09:26,368 --> 01:09:28,646
The soup's new too.

679
01:09:28,723 --> 01:09:30,960
You noticed? How is it?

680
01:09:31,221 --> 01:09:32,882
Umm.
Pretty good.

681
01:09:32,982 --> 01:09:33,982
Right?

682
01:10:20,269 --> 01:10:22,268
- You okay?
- Yeah.

683
01:10:22,376 --> 01:10:27,312
But damn...
You're pretty good.

684
01:10:28,477 --> 01:10:32,755
A long time ago
I boxed welterweight.

685
01:10:32,855 --> 01:10:35,165
That's not fair.

686
01:10:35,265 --> 01:10:38,588
I thought your left hook
was too good.

687
01:10:39,659 --> 01:10:41,990
Yours is fast too.

688
01:10:50,824 --> 01:10:54,366
Are you sweet on Tampopo?

689
01:10:55,244 --> 01:11:00,253
I just want to make
her place a good one.

690
01:11:02,315 --> 01:11:04,385
Let me help.

691
01:11:05,988 --> 01:11:07,636
What can you do?

692
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:11,633
I'm a contractor.
I do interiors too.

693
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,396
Bars and nightclubs mostly.

694
01:11:14,496 --> 01:11:17,864
Okay.
You do the interior.

695
01:11:17,933 --> 01:11:18,933
I'll do my best.

696
01:11:19,635 --> 01:11:22,474
Make sure she pays for it, okay?

697
01:11:25,941 --> 01:11:28,056
Okay.
My name is Pisken.

698
01:11:31,522 --> 01:11:32,554
I'm Goro.

699
01:11:50,332 --> 01:11:51,958
Oh, no! Not again!

700
01:11:54,701 --> 01:11:56,803
Relax.

701
01:11:58,365 --> 01:12:00,959
He's going to redecorate.

702
01:12:01,059 --> 01:12:02,762
That's why I brought him.

703
01:12:02,862 --> 01:12:03,875
Is that true?

704
01:12:03,947 --> 01:12:06,348
I like the name "Tampopo".
It'll do.

705
01:12:06,349 --> 01:12:10,708
We grew up together, you know.
I'll do my best.

706
01:12:10,808 --> 01:12:12,148
Thanks.

707
01:12:12,576 --> 01:12:15,228
Do you have any savings?

708
01:12:15,328 --> 01:12:16,906
One million yen.

709
01:12:17,398 --> 01:12:22,492
The decoration will cost...
around two million.

710
01:12:22,592 --> 01:12:24,132
That's more than I have.

711
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:26,811
If you sell 200 bowls and
net 200 yen each, ...

712
01:12:27,049 --> 01:12:30,712
you'll make 40,000 per day
and one million per month.

713
01:12:31,767 --> 01:12:34,067
You can pay me in no time.

714
01:12:34,575 --> 01:12:39,697
We'll rebuild all these
to fit the lady's size.

715
01:12:40,799 --> 01:12:43,504
Hey, Goro.
Give me a bowl.

716
01:12:45,161 --> 01:12:46,795
This is too high.

717
01:12:47,477 --> 01:12:50,673
The counter is too narrow.

718
01:12:51,584 --> 01:12:54,138
Noodles need the right space too.

719
01:12:54,238 --> 01:12:55,624
You need 40cm.

720
01:12:55,724 --> 01:12:59,134
But make it 45cm to be safe.

721
01:13:16,406 --> 01:13:17,627
Out of my way!

722
01:13:18,158 --> 01:13:19,914
She's just fine as she is.

723
01:13:20,014 --> 01:13:23,221
- What are you doing, you idiot?
- I'm no idiot.

724
01:13:23,321 --> 01:13:26,115
Can't you see. She needs
redecorating, too.

725
01:13:26,215 --> 01:13:28,097
Don't bother!
She's fine as she is.

726
01:13:28,197 --> 01:13:29,221
But...

727
01:13:29,252 --> 01:13:32,084
She's pretty enough.

728
01:13:32,337 --> 01:13:36,977
She may be pretty to you
because you're...

729
01:13:37,077 --> 01:13:39,229
sweet on her.

730
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:42,301
Stop joking. I'm not...

731
01:13:42,401 --> 01:13:46,437
No, no. You may think
she's pretty but...

732
01:13:46,533 --> 01:13:50,252
to other people she's just
a dowdy old middle-aged woman.

733
01:13:50,355 --> 01:13:52,742
A mouse, to be frank.

734
01:13:53,091 --> 01:13:55,274
You shut up!

735
01:13:59,744 --> 01:14:02,266
Just sit back and watch.

736
01:14:07,785 --> 01:14:09,126
Let's get started.

737
01:14:11,251 --> 01:14:13,521
Come on, Tampopo.

738
01:14:13,621 --> 01:14:14,883
All right.

739
01:14:23,867 --> 01:14:25,430
She's finished!

740
01:14:27,515 --> 01:14:28,863
I'll stay here.

741
01:14:29,094 --> 01:14:32,400
What do you mean,
"stay here"?

742
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:35,025
She's all done.
Take a look!

743
01:14:36,659 --> 01:14:37,991
But I told you...

744
01:14:38,126 --> 01:14:41,235
Don't be stubborn!
Come on!

745
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:19,680
Hi.

746
01:15:20,227 --> 01:15:21,827
How do I look?

747
01:15:27,673 --> 01:15:29,061
Like a film star...

748
01:15:32,892 --> 01:15:34,557
...in a French movie.

749
01:15:47,903 --> 01:15:48,934
Do you like it?

750
01:15:49,109 --> 01:15:50,109
I see you don't.

751
01:15:51,908 --> 01:15:57,272
Not that... but you
look hard to talk to now.

752
01:15:57,372 --> 01:16:02,053
Come on, Goro...
Let's go out!

753
01:16:35,801 --> 01:16:38,149
Am I trying hard enough?

754
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,306
- Sure you are.
- Am I good?

755
01:16:40,406 --> 01:16:42,394
- Sure.
- You really think so?

756
01:16:42,494 --> 01:16:44,612
- Sure.
- I'm so glad.

757
01:16:46,856 --> 01:16:48,421
- Goro.
- Uhm?

758
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:51,765
Why are you doing this for me?

759
01:16:52,447 --> 01:16:53,447
Well...

760
01:16:54,834 --> 01:16:56,800
Why do you try so hard?

761
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:59,100
Well...

762
01:17:00,583 --> 01:17:02,074
It's like...

763
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:08,259
everybody has their own ladder.

764
01:17:09,354 --> 01:17:12,637
Some climb the rungs to the top.

765
01:17:12,986 --> 01:17:16,544
But some don't even know
they have one.

766
01:17:18,338 --> 01:17:19,615
And you Goro, ...

767
01:17:21,146 --> 01:17:25,491
you helped me find my ladder.

768
01:17:35,904 --> 01:17:39,235
What was your husband like?

769
01:17:39,710 --> 01:17:41,249
A good man.

770
01:17:42,573 --> 01:17:45,563
A jolly fellow, always in a hurry.

771
01:17:46,974 --> 01:17:51,375
In restaurants, he ordered sake
while walking to the table...

772
01:17:51,756 --> 01:17:54,881
and ordered food while sitting down.

773
01:17:57,878 --> 01:17:59,750
And your wife?

774
01:18:01,011 --> 01:18:03,287
She left with the kids.

775
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:04,387
Why?

776
01:18:04,487 --> 01:18:05,532
Don't know.

777
01:18:12,026 --> 01:18:14,317
I grew up in a bad home.

778
01:18:15,031 --> 01:18:19,742
I wanted to make my own home
the best there was.

779
01:18:21,177 --> 01:18:22,818
I got married.

780
01:18:23,136 --> 01:18:24,500
We had kids.

781
01:18:24,999 --> 01:18:27,291
I finally built a decent home.

782
01:18:28,885 --> 01:18:32,818
But I was never comfortable.

783
01:18:33,556 --> 01:18:37,941
I don't know how to act
in a decent home.

784
01:18:41,542 --> 01:18:44,349
Before I knew it,
my wife was gone.

785
01:18:49,789 --> 01:18:53,120
Sometimes I wonder
if I'm really human.

786
01:19:15,253 --> 01:19:16,426
Hey, taxi!

787
01:19:28,052 --> 01:19:30,796
It was raining the day I met you.

788
01:19:47,822 --> 01:19:50,994
Damn it, we're wet.

789
01:20:02,143 --> 01:20:03,606
Got a cigarette?

790
01:20:03,706 --> 01:20:04,706
Here.

791
01:20:15,561 --> 01:20:19,729
I'll fill the bath.

792
01:25:43,441 --> 01:25:45,748
I'm so happy.

793
01:25:45,848 --> 01:25:51,390
It's been fun tonight.
Thank you so much.

794
01:25:51,490 --> 01:25:53,460
Not at all, sir.

795
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:57,044
It is my honor
doing business with you.

796
01:25:57,144 --> 01:25:59,333
More sake?

797
01:26:00,594 --> 01:26:03,956
I'm very interested in ...

798
01:26:04,377 --> 01:26:06,311
this investment opportunity.

799
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:09,450
I don't know all the details.

800
01:26:09,452 --> 01:26:14,589
But if you say so,
it must be good and safe.

801
01:26:14,590 --> 01:26:17,723
Can I leave everything to you?

802
01:26:17,842 --> 01:26:19,114
Certainly, sir.

803
01:26:19,214 --> 01:26:23,282
I'm honored to be helping
such a famous professor.

804
01:26:25,189 --> 01:26:30,495
However, we must be quick.
If word gets out, everyone will buy.

805
01:26:30,595 --> 01:26:32,189
Yes, I understand.

806
01:26:32,648 --> 01:26:35,914
Unfortunately,
tomorrow is Sunday.

807
01:26:35,983 --> 01:26:41,368
But first thing on Monday
I'll withdraw all my savings.

808
01:26:41,955 --> 01:26:46,674
Mind you, it's not all that much.

809
01:26:47,169 --> 01:26:49,352
I'm just a professor.

810
01:26:49,452 --> 01:26:54,592
If you'll excuse me,
I must call the office.

811
01:27:01,092 --> 01:27:02,800
It'll be Monday.

812
01:27:03,017 --> 01:27:04,763
He has millions.

813
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:07,122
Have the getaway car ready.

814
01:27:07,683 --> 01:27:09,916
He's a famous professor.

815
01:27:10,016 --> 01:27:12,708
He's retiring.
So he's wants to...

816
01:27:12,808 --> 01:27:15,067
Yeah, that's right.

817
01:27:15,167 --> 01:27:17,914
A sucker, a real sucker!

818
01:27:54,027 --> 01:27:58,989
Kumada, you're playing
the college professor again?

819
01:27:59,089 --> 01:28:03,130
Don't you ever get tired of that role?

820
01:28:05,056 --> 01:28:07,644
The other hand too.

821
01:28:09,199 --> 01:28:11,698
Please, sir.

822
01:28:12,539 --> 01:28:18,940
One more taste of this before I go.
I'll miss it so.

823
01:28:19,552 --> 01:28:20,775
Hurry up.

824
01:28:28,489 --> 01:28:34,961
That's odd.
I wonder where your victim went?

825
01:28:35,603 --> 01:28:39,164
What'll happen to me?

826
01:29:44,169 --> 01:29:46,502
Come on, darling!

827
01:29:46,706 --> 01:29:49,257
Don't die!
We need you!

828
01:29:49,397 --> 01:29:50,468
Come on!

829
01:29:51,029 --> 01:29:53,249
Don't sleep!
Or you'll die!

830
01:29:53,349 --> 01:29:56,549
Say something! Sing!

831
01:29:56,868 --> 01:29:58,857
Do something! Anything.

832
01:29:59,163 --> 01:30:00,629
Get up and cook!

833
01:30:00,729 --> 01:30:02,388
Go get dinner ready!

834
01:31:19,867 --> 01:31:21,537
Here.

835
01:31:36,658 --> 01:31:37,996
Thank you, Mom.

836
01:31:40,266 --> 01:31:41,502
Good!

837
01:31:42,051 --> 01:31:43,147
It's delicious.

838
01:32:08,365 --> 01:32:10,061
I'm sorry.

839
01:32:10,329 --> 01:32:12,165
She died at 9:22.

840
01:32:25,386 --> 01:32:27,234
Keep on eating!

841
01:32:27,502 --> 01:32:29,912
It's the last meal Mom cooked!

842
01:32:30,511 --> 01:32:34,234
Eat, eat while it's hot.

843
01:33:46,765 --> 01:33:48,397
How is it?

844
01:33:51,916 --> 01:33:54,352
Better luck next time.

845
01:33:54,452 --> 01:33:57,896
How can you guys be so mean?

846
01:33:58,278 --> 01:34:02,600
Can't you taste the difference?
I think it's much better.

847
01:34:03,149 --> 01:34:05,165
Can't you encourage her?

848
01:34:05,265 --> 01:34:06,361
We understand...

849
01:34:06,553 --> 01:34:09,727
but we want customers
to queue up for them.

850
01:34:10,696 --> 01:34:17,060
They're beginning to have depth,
but they still lack substance.

851
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:20,451
They're not alive enough.
They lack vigor.

852
01:34:20,551 --> 01:34:24,682
And they still lack profundity.

853
01:34:24,822 --> 01:34:25,957
I'm sorry.

854
01:34:26,633 --> 01:34:30,241
Don't look so sad, Tampopo.

855
01:34:30,687 --> 01:34:33,429
You're making
something good, right?

856
01:34:33,849 --> 01:34:37,368
When you do that
you should look happy.

857
01:34:38,732 --> 01:34:40,185
You're right.

858
01:34:40,530 --> 01:34:44,941
Okay. Now I'll show you
my secret recipe.

859
01:34:45,082 --> 01:34:47,570
Cut the onions like this.

860
01:34:47,670 --> 01:34:48,996
Shred the pork.

861
01:34:49,658 --> 01:34:52,554
Fry them lightly,
put them on the noodles.

862
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:54,796
Add a dash of sesame oil.

863
01:35:00,546 --> 01:35:02,741
Um. It's good.

864
01:35:02,841 --> 01:35:04,577
- Yes, very good.
- Wonderful.

865
01:35:04,677 --> 01:35:06,069
Let's sell it.

866
01:35:06,169 --> 01:35:09,090
We should name it.
How about "Spring Onion Noodles"?

867
01:35:09,190 --> 01:35:10,506
Or "Spring Onion Special"?

868
01:35:10,606 --> 01:35:13,589
"Spring Onion Special".
That's good.

869
01:35:13,689 --> 01:35:15,784
Customers will love it.

870
01:35:15,884 --> 01:35:17,732
Do you feel better now?

871
01:36:04,855 --> 01:36:06,742
With pork. Here.

872
01:36:10,847 --> 01:36:12,657
It was good. Thanks.

873
01:36:12,757 --> 01:36:14,327
Thank you very much.

874
01:36:16,966 --> 01:36:19,580
With pork for me, please.

875
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:26,707
Welcome.

876
01:36:26,860 --> 01:36:27,860
Welcome.

877
01:36:30,034 --> 01:36:31,107
Welcome.

878
01:36:31,207 --> 01:36:32,207
Welcome.

879
01:36:55,393 --> 01:36:57,841
You're looking serious, Mom.

880
01:36:58,032 --> 01:37:00,521
I'll pass their test today.

881
01:37:00,621 --> 01:37:02,624
After they eat these noodles...

882
01:37:02,724 --> 01:37:07,099
and if they drink
all my soup at the end, ...

883
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:09,201
then I've succeeded.

884
01:37:31,818 --> 01:37:33,705
Let's begin.

885
01:37:33,922 --> 01:37:35,286
Please!

886
01:39:53,503 --> 01:39:55,238
This is perfection.

887
01:39:55,338 --> 01:39:56,958
- Wow!
- At last!

888
01:39:57,072 --> 01:39:58,488
- Superb!
- Perfect!

889
01:40:01,649 --> 01:40:03,676
Tampopo...

890
01:40:03,776 --> 01:40:04,862
Congratulations!

891
01:41:55,578 --> 01:41:57,121
Darling!

892
01:41:57,784 --> 01:42:01,724
Come on, darling!
Don't die!

893
01:42:04,413 --> 01:42:05,778
Darling!

894
01:42:09,335 --> 01:42:12,125
Have I told you about it?

895
01:42:12,548 --> 01:42:13,759
What?

896
01:42:15,238 --> 01:42:18,336
About hunting wild boars in...

897
01:42:19,063 --> 01:42:20,465
winter.

898
01:42:21,498 --> 01:42:25,706
There's nothing much
for them to eat, so...

899
01:42:26,649 --> 01:42:28,472
they dig up yams.

900
01:42:29,556 --> 01:42:32,105
That's all they eat.

901
01:42:33,457 --> 01:42:36,109
When you shoot a boar...

902
01:42:37,001 --> 01:42:38,761
you immediately...

903
01:42:39,003 --> 01:42:40,979
slit its belly...

904
01:42:41,106 --> 01:42:43,057
and take its guts...

905
01:42:43,236 --> 01:42:45,480
and grill them.

906
01:42:55,947 --> 01:43:00,873
The intestines are full of yam.

907
01:43:02,972 --> 01:43:05,305
Yam sausages, you see?

908
01:43:07,052 --> 01:43:11,051
You grill them
over open fire.

909
01:43:11,578 --> 01:43:15,568
And then slice them
and eat them hot.

910
01:43:21,038 --> 01:43:22,848
Sound good?

911
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:25,003
Yes.

912
01:43:25,551 --> 01:43:28,088
They'd be nice with
soy sauce and horseradish.

913
01:43:30,523 --> 01:43:31,773
Darling!

914
01:43:32,538 --> 01:43:33,636
What's wrong?

915
01:43:33,736 --> 01:43:36,464
Please hold on!

916
01:43:39,295 --> 01:43:45,123
I would have loved...
to eat them with you.

917
01:43:46,384 --> 01:43:50,118
We'll do that someday.

918
01:43:51,636 --> 01:43:54,428
We'll go hunt boars in the winter.

919
01:43:55,104 --> 01:43:58,191
Darling, come on!

920
01:43:58,291 --> 01:44:00,191
Please don't die!

921
01:44:00,650 --> 01:44:04,465
Shhh.
Be absolutely silent.

922
01:44:15,860 --> 01:44:18,869
My last movie is starting.

923
01:45:29,858 --> 01:45:31,264
Good morning.

924
01:45:45,833 --> 01:45:49,683
Good morning.
And congratulations!

925
01:45:50,116 --> 01:45:51,510
Thank you.

926
01:45:52,628 --> 01:45:55,546
I don't believe this.

927
01:45:55,623 --> 01:45:57,625
And look at this beautiful counter!

928
01:45:57,728 --> 01:45:59,857
The lighting is perfect.

929
01:46:01,081 --> 01:46:03,895
Tabo, did you write the menu?

930
01:46:03,965 --> 01:46:05,132
Uh-huh.

931
01:46:05,133 --> 01:46:06,964
It's great too.

932
01:46:07,035 --> 01:46:08,764
Hey, Tabo.

933
01:46:08,837 --> 01:46:13,137
Hi, Ryuta, Yohei, Uchida!
Let's go. Bye, Mom!

934
01:46:13,208 --> 01:46:14,557
See you later!

935
01:46:27,383 --> 01:46:29,053
Are you comfortable working here?

936
01:46:29,410 --> 01:46:32,051
It's a dream.
I feel like a master chef.

937
01:46:34,996 --> 01:46:40,910
Frankly, I never thought a woman
could become a good noodle cook.

938
01:46:41,255 --> 01:46:43,998
But look at her.

939
01:46:44,472 --> 01:46:46,463
She's doing great.

940
01:46:46,541 --> 01:46:50,358
Yeah, and she looks so beautiful too.

941
01:46:59,525 --> 01:47:03,424
We'll drift away
when the customers start coming.

942
01:47:03,425 --> 01:47:04,725
Thank you so much.

943
01:47:04,726 --> 01:47:08,830
I feel like starting
a noodle business myself. Goodbye.

944
01:47:08,831 --> 01:47:10,423
Here they come.

945
01:47:10,499 --> 01:47:11,796
Welcome.

946
01:47:12,860 --> 01:47:16,540
Tampopo Noodles for me.
Lots of spring onions.

947
01:47:19,475 --> 01:47:20,942
Welcome.

948
01:47:22,144 --> 01:47:23,836
Plain noodles, please.

949
01:47:24,577 --> 01:47:25,801
Same for me.

950
01:47:26,056 --> 01:47:28,028
With lots of Shinachiku.

951
01:47:28,873 --> 01:47:30,085
Welcome.

952
01:47:32,622 --> 01:47:35,415
Thank you for all your help.

953
01:47:37,460 --> 01:47:40,495
He can't have roast pork.
So a plain one for him.

954
01:47:40,496 --> 01:47:42,691
I'll be at the bank.

955
01:47:42,765 --> 01:47:43,996
Come on, Shohei.

956
01:48:29,412 --> 01:48:30,970
Welcome.

957
01:48:32,415 --> 01:48:33,848
Welcome.

958
01:48:52,255 --> 01:48:54,868
A Spring Onion Special.

959
01:49:11,098 --> 01:49:12,743
Pork noodles for me.

960
01:50:07,782 --> 01:50:09,950
We did it, didn't we?

961
01:50:10,217 --> 01:50:12,219
Yeah, we sure did.

962
01:50:20,507 --> 01:50:22,590
So long... good luck.
