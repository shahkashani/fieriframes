00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,290
(Humming)

3
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:17,298
(Electronic chittering)

4
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,344
(Clacking)

5
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:37,568
(Distorted computer noises)

6
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:40,029
(Noises stop)

7
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:43,110
(Chattering, indistinct)

8
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:56,624
The food is terrible. Worst
shit I've ever seen, man.

9
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,168
Parker: What you say? You
got any biscuits over there?

10
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,587
Ripley: I keep seeing corn bread.

11
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,801
- I am cold.
- Still with us, Brett?

12
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:11,263
- Right.
- Oh, I feel dead.

13
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:14,225
Anybody ever tell you
you look dead, man?

14
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,146
(Mouthing words)
Parker: Oh, yeah, right.

15
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:21,315
Now, I just forgot something, man.

16
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,359
Uh, before we dock,

17
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,444
I think we oughta discuss
the bonus situation.

18
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,571
- Right. 
- Brett and I, we think we oughta

19
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:30,032
- We deserve full shares, right, baby?
- Right. You see, Mr. Parker and I...

20
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:33,744
feel that the bonus situation has
never been on, uh, an equitable level.

21
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:37,081
Well, you'll get what you're
contracted for like everybody else.

22
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:39,607
Yes, but everybody else gets more than us.
(Monitor beeping)

23
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,794
Dallas, Mother wants to talk to you.

24
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:45,297
Huh? Yeah, I saw it. Yellow
light's for my eyes only.

25
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,467
Okay, get dressed, huh?

26
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:52,012
- Parker, come on.
- Can I finish my coffee? Thank you.

27
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,557
It's the only thing good on this ship.

28
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,185
(Chattering continues)

29
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,530

(Clacking)
(Electronic chittering)

31
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,398
Dallas: Morning, Mother.

32
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,989
(Beeping, whirring)

33
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,886
(Voice over radio, indistinct)

34
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,181
- Right.
- Okay.

35
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,600
Plug us in.

36
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,770
Thank you.

37
00:09:26,891 --> 00:09:28,026
Where's Earth?

38
00:09:28,487 --> 00:09:30,287
Well you should know.

39
00:09:30,411 --> 00:09:31,880
It's not our system.

40
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,605
Scan.

41
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,828
(Sighs)
(Whispering) I can't believe this.

42
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,065
Contact Traffic Control.

43
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:47,628
Ripley: This is commercial towing
vehicle Nostromo out of the Solomons.

44
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:51,757
Registration number:
1-8-0-niner-2-4-6-0-niner.

45
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:56,428
Calling Antarctica Traffic
Control. Can you read me? Over.

46
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,765
Commercial towing vehicle
Nostromo out of the Solomons,

47
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,850
registration number...

48
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,599
Ripley: Nothing. 
Kane: Keep trying.

49
00:10:08,684 --> 00:10:13,112
Ripley: Calling Antarctica Traffic Control.
Do you read me, Antarctica? Over.

50
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:17,741
I found it. Just short of Zeta II Reticuli.
(Ripley continues on radio)

51
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:23,330
- We haven't reached the outer rim yet. 
- That's hard to believe.

52
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:27,459
Lambert: What the hell
are we doing out here?

53
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,295
I don't know. What the hell
are you talking about?

54
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,757
- That's not our system.
- I know that.

55
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:37,970
(Loud rumbling) Parker: Listen, you ever
notice how they never come down here?

56
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,180
I mean, this is where
the work is, right?

57
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,933
Well, it's the same damn reason
we get a half share to their one.

58
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:45,060
Our time is their time.
That's the way they see it.

59
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,104
Parker: No, but-Listen, man.
Brett: Same old shit, man.

60
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,314
Parker: I think I know why they
don't come down here.

61
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,900
It's because of you. You
don't have no personality.

62
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,697
Parker: Wonder what they want now.
What's going on down here?

63
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,653
Um, you happen to be in my seat.
Can I have it?

64
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:03,422
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you

65
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:04,897
Ash: I'm sorry.

66
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,750
(Wiping)

67
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,087
Parker: What's happenin' now, baby?

68
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:18,135
Well, some of you may have
figured out we're not home yet.

69
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,596
- We're only halfway there.
- What?

70
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,058
Mother's interrupted the
course of our journey.

71
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,060
- Why? 
- Yeah.

72
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:29,188
She's programmed to do that should
certain conditions arise. They have.

73
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,316
Ripley: Like what?
- It seems she has...

74
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,610
intercepted a transmission
of unknown origin.

75
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:37,946
- She got us up to check it out.
- A transmission? Out here?

76
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,783
Dallas: Yeah. 
- What kind of a transmission?

77
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:44,495
Acoustical beacon. It repeats
at intervals of 12 seconds.

78
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,497
- S.O.S.?
- I don't know.

79
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,499
Human?

80
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:49,960
Unknown.

81
00:11:50,141 --> 00:11:51,441
Brett: So what?

82
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,670
Kane: We are obligated
under section eight

83
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:56,048
I hate to bring this up, but, uh,

84
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,467
this is a commercial
ship, not a rescue ship.

85
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,612
- Right.
- And it's not in my contract

86
00:12:00,693 --> 00:12:02,093
to do this kind of duty.

87
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,316
And what about the money? 
If you wanna give me some money,

88
00:12:04,353 --> 00:12:05,953
I'll be happy to oblige.

89
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:07,235
- Man's right.
Dallas: Parker...

90
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,739
- Let's go over the bonus situation...
- Can we... Can...

91
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:12,433
- Sorry, can I say something?
- Let's talk about the bonus situation.

92
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:15,150
There is a clause in the contract
which specifically states...

93
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:18,403
any systematized transmission indicating
a possible intelligent origin

94
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,256
- must be investigated.
- I don't wanna hear it.

95
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,449
- We don't know if it's intelligent.
- I wanna go home and party.

96
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:24,827
Parker, will you just
listen to the man?

97
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,842
On penalty of total 
forfeiture of shares.

98
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:32,837
No money.

99
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,503
You got that?

100
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:38,340
- (Chuckling) Well, yeah.
- All right, we're going in.

101
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,342
Yeah. We're goin' in, aren't we?

102
00:12:47,197 --> 00:12:49,077
(Clears throat) Can we
all hear that, Lambert?

103
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,061
(Beeping)

104
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,364
(Electronic pulsing)

105
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:11,748
(Pulsing continues)

106
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,792
(Scoffs)
Good God.

107
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:16,253
Doesn't sound like any
radio signal I've heard.

108
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,547
- Maybe it's a voice.
- Well, we'll soon know.

109
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,716
Can you hone in on that?

110
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:24,553
What was the, uh, position?

111
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:28,432
6550-99.

112
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,642
(Beeping)

113
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:33,145
(Clacking)

114
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,106
(Beeping) All right.
It found the quadrant.

115
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:40,027
Ascension: Six minutes, 20 seconds.

116
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:44,698
Declination: 39 degrees, two seconds.

117
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,950
Okay. Put that on the screen for me.

118
00:13:48,215 --> 00:13:50,215
(Computer beeping and whirring)

119
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,332
Lambert: All right.
Well, that's it.

120
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,935
It's a planetoid.

121
00:13:54,989 --> 00:13:56,789
1200 kilometers.

122
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,463
Kane: It's tiny.
Dallas: Any rotation?

123
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,840
(Beeping)

124
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:04,343
Lambert: About two hours.

125
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,762
What about gravity?

126
00:14:07,946 --> 00:14:09,523
Point eight-six.

127
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,644
You can walk on it.

128
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,740
(Lambert over radio)
Approaching orbital apogee.

129

Mark 12, 11

130
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,246
Equatorial orbit nailed.

131
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,624
Lambert: Nine, eight
seconds on descent.

132
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,877
Kane: Grids energized. Fields focused.
Lambert: Five. Four

133
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:42,172
(Dallas, indistinct)

134
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,389
- D.O.R.'s on line.
- How's the status on the lifters?

135
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:53,016
Give me an A.C. pressure reading.

136
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:02,317
Forty-eight seconds and counting.

137
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,945
(Ripley over radio) SR-1 stable.

138
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,531
Prepare to disengage from platform.

139
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:12,411
Lambert: Mark, 20 seconds. Eighteen, 17

144
00:15:27,884 --> 00:15:29,719
Disengage.

145
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,184
Ripley: Umbilicus clear.

146
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,608
Money's safe. Let's take her down.

147

Parker: Nine, eight, seven

00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,228
What the hell was that?

160
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,772
Pressure drop in intake three.
Must've lost a shield.

161
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,607
Let's go with it.

162
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:09,069
(Voices over radio continue)

163
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:15,492
Mm...
Dropping off now.

164
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,830
Still dropping.

165
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,500
Here we are. We've got it.

166
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,919
Take her down.

167
00:17:25,226 --> 00:17:27,226
(Ripley over radio)
Approaching perigee...

168
00:17:33,143 --> 00:17:35,269
Navigation lights on.

169
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:46,106
Ash: We've got 5-3 still out.
No problem. Just down 11%.

170
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,775
Grid status okay.

171
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,796
Lambert: Nine,

172
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:13,300
eight, seven, six,

173
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:17,470
five, four, three,

174
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,472
two, one.

175
00:18:20,157 --> 00:18:22,158
Kill drive engines.

176
00:18:30,128 --> 00:18:32,128
(Loud crunching sounds)

177
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,488
(Alarm blaring)

178
00:18:41,211 --> 00:18:43,129
Dallas: What the hell happened?
(Additional alarm sounds)

179
00:18:43,218 --> 00:18:45,218
(Hissing sounds)
(First alarm silences)

180
00:18:45,455 --> 00:18:47,000
Somebody give me a straight answer!

181
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,587
Is the hull breached?

182
00:18:48,668 --> 00:18:50,668
 I don't see anything. 
We've still got pressure.

183
00:18:51,772 --> 00:18:53,658
Hit the screen.
(Loud hissing and roaring)

184
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,427
(Wind howling)

185
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:05,769
(Parker over radio)
Secondary load sharing unit...

186
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,771
is out.

187
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,982
Three to four cells are gone.

188
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:16,446
- Is that it?
- No, hold on, uh,

189
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,824
We can't fix it out here anyway,
and, uh, we need to reroute

190
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:22,253
a couple of these ducts, 
wouldn't you say, uh, Brett?

191
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,780
Dry dock time.

192
00:19:23,937 --> 00:19:25,872
Dry dock. Tell her
we need to dry-dock.

193
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:27,874
Look, we couldn't fix it out here anyway.

194
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,876
We gotta reroute all these ducts,

195
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:32,587
and in order to do that
we've got to dry-dock.

196
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,923
(Sighs)
What else?

197
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,925
(Parker over radio)
Some fragments kicked up,

198
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,386
and we've got to clean it all
out and repressurize it.

199
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,846
(Ripley over radio) How
long before we're functional?

200
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:46,393
- Look, what is- What-
- It's 17 hours, tell her.

201
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,312
- At least 25 hours.
- Yeah.

202
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,837
Ripley: Get started on the floor panel.
I'll be right down.

203
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,900
What the hell's she comin' down here for?

204
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:56,069
She better stay the fuck out
of my way, I'll tell you that.

205
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,222
I'd like to see what she's
gonna do when she gets here.

206
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,610
Parker: Shit.

207
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:02,701
(Wind howling)

208
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:12,585
Dallas: Any response yet?
Ash: No. Absolutely nothing.

209
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,839
Except the same transmission
every 12 seconds.

210
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,924
All the other channels are dead.

211
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:26,016
(Clicks switch)
Kick on the floods.

212
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:44,534
- We can't go anywhere in this.
- Mmm.

213
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,911
Well, Mother says the sun's
coming up in 20 minutes.

214
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:50,373
- How far are we from the source of transmission?
- Uh, northeast.

215
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,876
Just under 2,000 meters.

216
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,462
Walking distance?

217
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:58,089
(Laughs)
Well

218
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,343
- Can you give me an atmospheric?
- Yes.

219
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,389
Ash: Oh.

220
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:09,809
It's almost primordial.

221
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,895
There's inert nitrogen,

222
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,647
high concentration of carbon
dioxide crystals, methane.

223
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,649
I'm working on the trace elements.

224
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,860
- Anything else?
- Yes.

225
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,862
It's...

226
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,323
rock, lava base,

227
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,325
and deep cold.

228
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:29,329
- Well below the line.
- Mm-hmm.

229
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:32,082
Kane: I'll volunteer to be
in the first group to go out.

230
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,918
Dallas: Yeah, that figures.

231
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,796
You too, Lambert.

232
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:41,424
- Swell.
Dallas: Better break out the weapons.

233
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,081
(Wind howling)

234
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:58,418
Lambert: I can't see a goddamn thing.

235
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,921
Dallas: Ash, are you receiving?

236
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:04,632
(Voices over radio, indistinct)

237
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,634
(Mouths words)

238
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,012
Ash: Good contact on my board.

239
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:13,349
(Dallas over monitor) Clear and free.
Keep the line open. Let's go.

240
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:30,533
Hey, Ripley.

241
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:32,702
Hey, Ripley, I wanna ask you a question.

242
00:23:34,653 --> 00:23:37,933
If they find what they're lookin' for out
there, does that mean we get full shares?

243
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:42,212
Don't worry, Parker, yeah. You'll
get whatever's coming to you.

244
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:44,839
Look, I'm not gonna
do any more work...

245
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:47,842
- till we get this straightened out.
- Brett,

246
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,554
- you're guaranteed by law to get a share.
Parker: What?

247
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:54,807
- Why don't you just fuck off.
- What?

248
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:57,310
Brett: What'd you say, Rip?

249
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:01,064
If you have any trouble,
I'll be on the bridge.

250
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:05,193
Parker: Hey, Ripley, come back here!

251
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:10,031
(Chuckling)

252
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:13,159
- Son of a bitch.
- What's the matter?

253
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,880
Lambert: Can't see a goddamn thing.

254
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,716
Kane: Quit griping.
- I like griping.

255
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,843
Dallas: Come on. Knock it off.

256
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,029
(Clacking)

257
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:07,625
(Ominous silence)

258
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,350
(Quiet hissing)

259
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,745
(Respirators hissing)

260
00:25:55,628 --> 00:25:57,946
Ash, can you see this?

261
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,240
Yes, I can.

262
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,228
I've never seen anything like it.

263
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,657
Dallas: Very bizarre.

264
00:26:15,721 --> 00:26:18,521
(Heartbeat pounding)
(Suit electronics beeping)

265
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,995
Kane: You said it.

266
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:32,048
Dallas (Breathing heavily): 
All right.

267
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,634
Moving on to second... position.

268
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:37,345
Lambert: What is it?

269
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,140
Let's get out of here.

270
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:43,893
Kane: We've got this far.
We must go on.

271
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,937
We have to go on.

272
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:51,260
Will you say that again? Shit.

273
00:26:51,738 --> 00:26:53,038
Shhhhit.

274
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:58,116
Dallas: Ash, as you can see,
it's kind of hard to describe.

275
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,910
I'm going back to the console.

276
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,877
(Voices continue over monitor, distorted)

277
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:18,052
(Dallas, faint) Seems to be solid.

278
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:20,722
To walk- You can on it.

279
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:31,691
(Dallas continues, voice distorted)
Approaching the entrance...

280
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:45,913
(Dallas continues, indistinct)

281
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,710
Dallas?

282
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,631
(Respirators hissing)

283
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:44,514
Kane: Come on down here.
Something different down here.

284
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,392
I don't know what it is, but...

285
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:51,854
See if we can get up that wall. If we
can get up that wall, we can find out.

286
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,581
Amazing.

287
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:03,333
Dallas: Alien life-form.

288
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:07,096
Looks like it's been dead a long time.

289
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,099
Fossilized.

290
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:13,269
Looks like it's grown
out of the chair.

291
00:30:20,722 --> 00:30:21,922
Huh...

292
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,781
Bones are bent outward,

293
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:28,910
like he exploded from inside.

294
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,664
Lambert: Wonder what happened
to the rest of the crew.

295
00:30:38,544 --> 00:30:40,730
Let's get the hell out of here.

296
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:55,269
Hey, Dallas, Lambert,
come on over here.

297
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:01,025
Come on.

298
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:08,074
- What do you got? 
- See what you make of this.

299
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,500
(Clicks switch)
Ash.

300
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:21,003
That transmission- Mother's
deciphered part of it.

301
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,547
- It doesn't look like an S.O.S.
- What is it, then?

302
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:26,968
Well, I- it looks
like a warning.

303
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,637
- I'm gonna go out after them.
- What's the point?

304
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,726
I mean, by the time it
takes to get there, you'll...

305
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:38,270
they'll know if it's a
warning or not, yes?

306
00:31:40,355 --> 00:31:41,314
(Clicks switch)

307
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,985
(Exhales deeply)

308
00:31:46,601 --> 00:31:50,301
(Wind howling lightly)

309
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:56,230
(Winch motor whirring)

310
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,383
Dallas: You okay down there?

311
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,282
Dallas: Can you see anything?
Kane: Uh... a cave.

312
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,894
A ca- a cave of some sort.
But I...

313
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,858
Well, I don't know, but it's like
the goddamn tropics in here.

314
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:29,321
(Whispering) 
What the hell is this?

315
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:59,852
The cave is completely enclosed,

316
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,313
and it's full of...

317
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:06,233
leathery objects, like...
eggs or something.

318
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:11,238
(High-pitched humming)

319
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:26,504
There's a layer of mist...
(High-pitched tone)

320
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:30,633
just covering the eggs
that reacts when broken.

321
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:37,364
(Dallas over radio)
Kane? You all right?

322
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:39,991
I'm okay. All right.

323
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:43,771
I'm okay. I just slipped.

324
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,877
Appears to be completely sealed.

325
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:15,636
(Hisses)

326
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,123
Wait a minute, there's movement.

327
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:49,670
It seems to have life.
Organic life.

328
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,510
(Creaking sound)

329
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,654
(Screeching)

330
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,408
(Wind howling)

331
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:30,299
(Wind intensity increases)

332
00:35:36,483 --> 00:35:39,683
(Wind howling loudly)

333
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:43,057
(Computer clacking)

334
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,528
(Dallas over radio) You there, Ripley?
- I'm right here.

335
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:03,077
(Beeping)

336
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:05,621
Okay, Ripley, I'm at the 
inner lock hatch now.

337
00:36:05,676 --> 00:36:06,376
(Ripley) Right.

338
00:36:06,505 --> 00:36:09,905
(Decontamination sprayers hissing)

339
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:18,717
- Ripley. We're clean. Let us in.
- Right here.

340
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:21,553
- What happened to Kane?
- Something has attached itself to him.

341
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:23,282
We have to get him to 
the infirmary right away.

342
00:36:23,315 --> 00:36:25,215
What kind of thing, I need

343
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,559
- a clear definition.
- An organism! Open the hatch.

344
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:30,062
Wait a minute. If we let it in,
the ship could be infected.

345
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:33,941
You know the quarantine procedure-
24 hours for decontamination.

346
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,901
He could die in 24 hours.
Open the hatch.

347
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:38,821
Listen to me. If we break
quarantine, we could all die.

348
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:43,284
Look, would you open the goddamn
hatch? We have to get him inside.

349
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:46,829
No. I can't do that.

350
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,131
And if you were in my
position, you'd do the same.

351
00:36:49,216 --> 00:36:51,192
Ripley, this is an order.
Open that hatch right now.

352
00:36:51,218 --> 00:36:53,294
- Do you hear me?
- Yes.

353
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,421
Ripley, this is an order!
Do you hear me?

354
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:59,300
Yes, I read you. The answer is negative.

355
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,345
Inner hatch opened.

356
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,598
(Whirring)

357
00:37:28,702 --> 00:37:30,002
(Helmet cracks open)

358
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,042
My God.

359
00:37:35,688 --> 00:37:37,688
(Tail tightening)

360
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:45,262
What the hell is that?

361
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:49,933
Jesus Christ.

362
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:54,188
What is that, man?

363
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,317
Hey, how the hell is he breathing?

364
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,319
Is he still alive or what?

365
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:03,363
Why don't you guys freeze him?

366
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,449
How come they don't freeze him?

367
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,493
What's going on in there?

368
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:09,912
- What the fuck is going on?
- You bitch!

369
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,456
Jesus Christ! Hey! Hey!

370
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,792
- You would've left us out there.
- Break it up.

371
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:19,379
Dallas: Ripley, when I give
an order, I expect to be obeyed.

372
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:22,966
- Even if it's against the law?
- You're goddamn right!

373
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:25,844
Maybe she has a point, you know. 
Who the hell knows what that thing is?

374
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:28,722
How are we gonna get that off him?

375
00:38:28,748 --> 00:38:30,467
- How are we gonna get it off?
- Now just a minute, just a minute,

376
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,108
I'm gonna get some instruments here.

377
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,232
My God.

378
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:44,488
(Mumbling)
Right. I'll make an incision here.

379
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:50,035
- Try and remove one of the digitals from...
- You're gonna do what?

380
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,205
(Clearly) Finger. I'm gonna try and 
get his finger off. Just a minute.

381
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,833
(Continues, indistinct)

382
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,931
No, that's not... 
It's tearing his scalp!

383
00:39:01,058 --> 00:39:02,458
(Ash) I know!

384
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:06,510
It's not coming off without
tearing his face off with it.

385
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:09,635
We'll have to take a 
look at him inside. Right!

386
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:14,726
How come they don't freeze him?

387
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:17,729
(Parker shouting) How come
you guys don't freeze him?

388
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,831
All right, you can take your mask off.

389
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,172
What's it got down his throat?

390
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:58,993
I would suggest it's 
feeding him oxygen.

391
00:40:00,156 --> 00:40:04,060
Paralyzes him, 
puts him in a coma,

392
00:40:04,244 --> 00:40:07,079
then keeps him alive.
Now what the hell is that?

393
00:40:07,806 --> 00:40:09,723
- Well, we gotta get it off of him.
- Just a minute,

394
00:40:09,808 --> 00:40:11,225
just a minute.

395
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,369
I mean, let's not be too hasty.

396
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:16,622
We don't know anything about...

397
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:18,265
it.

398
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:21,660
Now, we're assuming it's feeding
him oxygen. If we remove it,

399
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:25,214
it could kill him.

400
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,081
I'm willing to take that chance.
Let's cut it off him now.

401
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,847
- You'll take responsibility?
- Yes, yes,

402
00:40:31,928 --> 00:40:33,928
I'll take responsibility. 
Now, get him out of there.

403
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,684
Dallas: Where do you wanna do this?

404
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:40,938
We'll make an incision just
below the knuckle there.

405
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:42,689
- Right here. 
- Stand by.

406
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:48,946
(Whirring)

407
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:53,492
Ash: Good God!

408
00:40:57,513 --> 00:41:00,807
Dallas: That crap's gonna
eat through the hull.

409
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,419
That thing's gonna eat through
the goddamn hull. Come on!

410
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:07,047
Brett: What's going on?

411
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,132
This way.

412
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:19,351
Next deck.

413
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,787
(Sizzling)
Parker: There it is.

414
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,457
Don't get under it!
Don't get under it.

415
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:50,299
Looks like it's stopping.

416
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,095
Take a look at this, man. Yeah.

417
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:58,724
Brett, give me- what do you got, a
pen there? Give it to me, quick.

418
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:00,976
Come on! Come on!

419
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,516
Brett: Don't get any on your arm.

420
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:08,699
(Melted material glops)

421
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:17,326
It stopped.

422
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:21,455
Don't see anything like that
except, uh, molecular acid.

423
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,624
It must be using it for blood.

424
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:26,626
It's got a wonderful defense mechanism.

425
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,920
You don't dare kill it.

426
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:30,881
What about Kane?

427
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:36,303
- Here's your pen back.
- Brett: What do we do now?

428
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,514
Leave Kane to Ash. You get back to work.

429
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:43,643
Well, what...

430
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:46,730
(Electrical crackling)

431
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:54,863
Okay.

432
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,866
Try it.
(Motor cranking)

433
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:03,914
Damn it. I thought sure that was it.

434
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,292
Try it again.
(Cranking)

435
00:43:07,377 --> 00:43:10,003
I feel like I've been
in this place a month.

436
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:14,049
We shouldn't have landed in
this place in the first place.

437
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:19,971
Shouldn't have landed on
this damn ball, I know that.

438
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:23,309
Well, the sooner we patch this 
thing up and get out of here,

439
00:43:23,693 --> 00:43:26,527
the sooner we can go home.
This place gives me the creeps.

440
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,461
Ripley: That's amazing. What is it?

441
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:37,215
Ah, yes, it is. Um...

442
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,426
I don't know yet.

443
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:45,098
(Grunts)
Did you want something?

444
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,476
Yes. I, uh...

445
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:52,189
I'd like to have a little talk.
How's, uh, how's Kane?

446
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:54,858
He's holding. No changes.

447
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:58,671
And, uh, our guest?

448
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:02,616
- Well...
- Hmm?

449
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,576
Well, as I said, I'm still...

450
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,620
collating, actually, but, uh,

451
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:10,749
I have confirmed that he's got an outer
layer of protein polysaccharides.

452
00:45:12,502 --> 00:45:14,794
He has a funny habit of
shedding his cells...

453
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:18,715
and replacing them with...
polarized silicon,

454
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,926
which gives him a
prolonged resistance...

455
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:24,930
to adverse environmental conditions.

456
00:45:24,956 --> 00:45:26,457
Is that enough for you?

457
00:45:26,516 --> 00:45:28,516
That's plenty. What 
does it mean?

458
00:45:28,683 --> 00:45:30,435
(Pen clatters on table)
Please don't do that. Thank you.

459
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,563
I'm sorry.

460
00:45:31,643 --> 00:45:33,543
(Ash breathes deeply)

461
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:35,625
Well, it's an interesting
combination of elements,

462
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:36,795
making him a...

463
00:45:37,455 --> 00:45:39,455
tough little son of a bitch.

464
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:42,656
And you let him in.

465
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,116
I was obeying a direct order, remember?

466
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:49,287
Ash, when Dallas and
Kane are off the ship,

467
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:51,456
I'm senior officer.

468
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:53,517
Oh, yes. I forgot.

469
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:57,921
You also forgot the science
division's basic quarantine law.

470
00:45:58,947 --> 00:46:01,115
- No, that I didn't forget.
- Oh, I see, you just broke it.

471
00:46:02,399 --> 00:46:02,968
Huh?

472
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:06,680
Look, what would you have
done with Kane? Hmm?

473
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:10,058
You knew his only chance of
survival was to get him in here.

474
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,561
Unfortunately, by uh,
breaking quarantine,

Maybe I should've left him outside.

477
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:21,695
Maybe I've jeopardized the rest of us,
but it was a risk I was willing to take.

478
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,947
That's a pretty big risk...

479
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,949
for a science officer.

480

for God's sake, 
this is the first time

518
00:50:35,214 --> 00:50:36,933
that we've encountered 
a species like this.

519
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:39,661
It has to go back. All sorts
of tests have to be made.

Ash, are you kidding?
This thing bled acid.

do when it's dead.

you're the science officer,

How come I've got to change my
mind? The decision's been made.

529
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,893
I'm not trying to change your mind,
Dallas. I just want you to listen,

530
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:05,895
Will you listen to-

division, Ash has the final word.

535
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:16,916
- How does that happen?
- It happens, my dear,

536
00:51:16,929 --> 00:51:18,575
because that's what the
company wants to happen.

537
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:21,069
Since when is that standard procedure?

538
00:51:21,153 --> 00:51:24,038
Standard procedure is to do what
the hell they tell you to do.

539
00:51:24,064 --> 00:51:26,217
What's happening with 
the repairs? How's it going?

Why the hell didn't you tell me so?

542
00:51:29,804 --> 00:51:31,489
Well, because there's 
still some things left to do.

543

Like what?

544

Well, we're blind on
'B' and 'C' decks.

- Ah, now that's a bunch of horseshit,

546
00:51:38,037 --> 00:51:39,764
We can take off without that.

547
00:51:39,778 --> 00:51:41,678
Yeah, we can. You think 
that's a good idea?

548
00:51:41,748 --> 00:51:44,225

hell out of here, all right?

Spit on it for two minutes,
would you, for Christ's sake?

552
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:17,258

We're getting hotter.

Engine room, red clip status?

554

Ripley: Engage artificial gravity.

555

- I'm altering the vector... now.

Dallas: Inhibit C.N.G. control.

When we fix something, 
we stay fixed, don't we, Brett baby?

00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:14,106
Brett: Right.

00:53:29,031 --> 00:53:30,432
Parker: What I think we
should do is just freeze him.

565
00:53:30,557 --> 00:53:32,709
I mean he's got a disease, 
why don't we stop it where it is?

566
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:34,721
He can always get to a doctor 
when we get back home.

567
00:53:34,784 --> 00:53:36,484
Right.

568
00:53:36,505 --> 00:53:40,174
Whenever he says anything, you say
"right", Brett. You know that?

569
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,468
Right.
(Sighs)

570
00:53:42,489 --> 00:53:45,489
Parker, what do you think? Your staff
just follows you around, says "right".

571
00:53:45,514 --> 00:53:47,932
- Just like a regular parrot.
- Yeah. Shape up.

572
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:50,818
- What are you, some kind of parrot?
- Right.

573
00:53:50,903 --> 00:53:54,105
Oh come on. Knock it off! Kane's
gonna have to go into quarantine

574
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:56,983
- That's it.
- Yes, and so will we.

575
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,318
Well, how about a little
something to lower your spirits?

576
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:01,487
Thrill me, will you, please?

577
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:03,489
Well, according to my calculations,

578
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:05,592
based on time spent getting
to and from the planet

579
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,170
Just give me the short version.

580
00:54:07,233 --> 00:54:09,133
- How far to Earth?
- Ten months.

581
00:54:09,154 --> 00:54:10,472
- Oh, God.
- Right.

582
00:54:10,498 --> 00:54:11,490
(Intercom buzzes)

583
00:54:12,775 --> 00:54:13,275

585
00:54:15,802 --> 00:54:17,244
Has his condition changed?

586
00:54:17,315 --> 00:54:18,815
It's simpler if you'd 
just come and see him.

587
00:54:18,829 --> 00:54:20,410
Ripley: We're on our way.

588

591
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:34,395
- (Coughs) Thank you.
- How you doin'?

592
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,689
Um, terrific. Next silly question.

00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:42,320
Oh, thank you.

595
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:46,991
Do you remember 
anything about the planet?

596
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:52,330
What's the last thing 
you do remember?

597
00:54:53,874 --> 00:54:56,083
Huh?
(Sighs)

598
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:01,172
I remember some...

599
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:03,425
horrible dream about...

600
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:05,433
smothering, and...

601
00:55:07,286 --> 00:55:09,087
And-anyway, where are we?

602
00:55:09,114 --> 00:55:11,048
- Right here. (Laughs)
- We're on our way home.

603
00:55:11,133 --> 00:55:13,217
Yeah, back to the old freezerinos.

604
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,177
(Everyone chuckling)

605
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:17,355
Could I have something to
eat before we go back?

606
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:19,273
I-I need something myself.

607
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:22,985
Yeah, right. One more meal
before bedtime. I'm buyin'.

608
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:26,155
- Hey, that's a break. 
- Big time.

609
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,909
(Chattering)

610
00:55:32,233 --> 00:55:34,533
(Parker) What happened...
What happened to this guy...

611
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:37,083
(Chattering continues)

612
00:55:37,201 --> 00:55:41,001
(Heartbeat sounding)

613
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:48,469
The first thing that I'm
gonna do when I get back...

614
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:50,555
is to get some decent food.

615
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:53,349
I can dig it, man. Let me tell you,
I've eaten worse food than this,

616
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:56,143
- but then I've tasted better, you know what
I'm sayin'? - The other one over there.

617
00:55:56,228 --> 00:55:59,313
Well, you pound down the stuff
like there's no tomorrow.

618
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:03,392
I'd rather be eatin' something else,
but, uh, right now I'll stick with the food.

619
00:56:03,476 --> 00:56:06,696
Kane: Well, at least you
know what it's made of.

620
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,824
No, man, I don't wanna talk
about what it's made of.

621
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,909
- I'm eatin' this just to-
(Gagging)

622
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:15,162
What's the matter?

623
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:17,498
- The food ain't that bad, baby.
- What's wrong, Kane?

624
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,542
(Gagging, retching)
Are you choking?

625
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,502
What's wrong?

626
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:25,464
(Coughing, gasping)
What? What?

627
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:28,593
- This is serious.
- Kane, what's the matter?

628
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:32,680
(Gagging, gasping)
It's okay!

00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:42,273
(Groaning)
Damn it!

632
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,650
- Get it into his mouth!
- I'm trying!

633
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:46,652
(Screaming)

634
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,040
(Agonized scream)

635
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:58,298
(Lambert screams)

636
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:02,293
(Agonized grunts)

637
00:57:09,463 --> 00:57:10,563
(Bones breaking)

638
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:12,428
(Screeching)
(Screaming)

639
00:57:14,212 --> 00:57:18,090
Lambert: Oh, my God! Oh! (Crying)

640
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:26,567
No! Don't touch it!
Don't touch it!

641
00:57:31,189 --> 00:57:32,650
(Screeching)

642
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,760
(Dishes clatter)

643
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:45,294
Brett: Dallas?

644
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,664
Dallas?

645
00:57:47,614 --> 00:57:49,614
- Yeah.
- Anything?

646
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:51,726
No. You?

647
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,945
Nothing.

648
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:57,056
- You see anything?
- No.

649
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:20,246
(Loud clank)
Dallas: Inner hatch sealed.

650
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:27,293
Anybody wanna say anything?

651
00:58:35,898 --> 00:58:37,898
(Air rushing)

652
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:06,250
This is just an ordinary
prod, like a cattle prod.

653
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:08,252
It's got a portable battery.

654
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:11,047
It's insulated all the way
here, all the way up to here.

655
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:14,091
Just make damn sure nobody puts
their hand on the end of it.

656
00:59:15,295 --> 00:59:16,295
(Loud arcing)

657
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:19,555
It shouldn't damage the little bastard,

658
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:22,141
unless its skin's thinner than ours.

659
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:26,395
But it will give him
a little incentive.

660
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,481
Now we just have to find it.

661
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:32,401
I've taken care of that. I've
designed this tracking device.

662
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:36,906
You just set it to search for
a moving object, like so.

663
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:39,492
Hasn't got much of a range, but when
you get within a certain distance,

664
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:41,619
it'll start to give off a signal.

665
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:43,889
What's it key on?

666
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:48,626
Micro changes in air density.

667
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:51,087
Give me a demo.

668
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:56,425
(Whirring) See? 
Again. (Whirring)

669
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:58,844
Got ya.

670
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:01,631
Two teams. Ash...

671
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:05,935
Lambert and I, 
Ripley, you take Parker and Brett.

672
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:08,521
Now, anyone see this thing,
you catch it in the net...

673
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,731
that Parker's holding on his lap.

674
01:00:10,816 --> 01:00:13,734
Parker, I don't want any
heroics out of you, all right?

675
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:17,238
Catch it, put it in the
air lock, get rid of it.

676
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:19,198
Now, channels are open on all decks.

677
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:23,410
I want you to communicate, keep
in touch at all times, all right?

678
01:00:23,495 --> 01:00:25,496
Let's go.

679
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,710
Ripley: I thought you 
fixed 12 module.

680
01:00:32,695 --> 01:00:33,963
Brett: We did.

681
01:00:35,247 --> 01:00:37,290
I don't understand it.

682
01:00:39,018 --> 01:00:41,311
Parker: The circuits must have burned out.

683
01:00:54,216 --> 01:00:57,351
- What do we got here? 
- Dammit, hold your light over here, would ya?

684
01:00:57,436 --> 01:00:59,353
Yeah, that's it.

685
01:00:59,438 --> 01:01:02,099
- I don't know if this is gonna work.
- RIght

686
01:01:03,184 --> 01:01:05,810
If I could just put this-
put this in there.

687
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:08,646
- Right. 
- Oh, damn it.

688
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:13,419
Brett: Check the insulation.

689
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:15,721
Parker: Oh, shit!

690
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:20,374
(Electricity sputtering)

691
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:30,811
(Tracking device whirring)

692
01:01:38,577 --> 01:01:41,955
Brett: Steady. 
- According to this, it's within five meters.

693
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:44,450
(Indistinct whispering)

694
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:48,954
Ripley: Micro changes
in air density, my ass.

695
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:51,165
(Equipment beeping)

696
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:57,129
It's within five meters.

697
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:59,048
Parker: Be careful.

698
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:08,515
(Beeping continues)

699
01:02:08,642 --> 01:02:10,160
Ripley: Christ.
Parker: Don't do that.

700
01:02:10,245 --> 01:02:13,038
- Don't creep up on me with that thing.
Ripley: You guys, stick together.

701
01:02:16,312 --> 01:02:18,312
(Click)
(Beeping stops)

702
01:02:20,046 --> 01:02:24,215
(Tracker twittering)

703
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:33,624
- Don't fail me now.
Parker: What?

704
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,918
- What is it?
- Parker, Brett, it's in this locker!

705
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:37,920
Where?

706
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:40,005
Brett: Here, take this.

707
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:42,508
Get over there and get the net.

708
01:02:42,634 --> 01:02:45,219
- Get it?
- I got it. I got it. I got it.

709
01:02:46,503 --> 01:02:48,388
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

710
01:02:49,641 --> 01:02:52,685
All right, Parker. When I say.

711
01:02:54,887 --> 01:02:56,271
All right. Now.

712
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:58,357
Easy.

713
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:01,944
(Hissing)

714
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:04,655
(All chattering)
- Wait! Don't let him go!

715
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,949
What the hell are
you doing, man?

716
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:08,951
It's the cat.

717
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:11,870
(Laughing)

718
01:03:15,417 --> 01:03:18,293
Hey, look, now. We had to bag it, man.

719
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:21,588
Now we might pick it up
on the tracker again.

720
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:23,966
- I'll-I'll-I'll-
- Go and get it, man.

721
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:26,885
All right. You get him.
We'll go on.

722
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:31,974
(Sighs)
(Scoffs)

723
01:03:38,398 --> 01:03:40,816
Here, kitty!

724
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,277
Here, kitty, kitty!

725
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:45,988
Enough of that kitty crap.

726
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:47,492
Jones?

727
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:51,994
Jonesy?

728
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:54,079
Here, Jonesy.

729
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:59,209
(Meowing)
(Cat meows)

730
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,756
Jonesy?

731
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:11,263
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

732
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:14,725
(Meowing)

733
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:20,147
Here, Jonesy.

734
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:33,827
(Whispering) Jonesy?

735
01:04:33,912 --> 01:04:36,121
(Faint meowing)

736
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:47,257
Here, kitty, kitty.

737
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:57,684
(Panicked meowing)
- Shh.. No, don't...

738
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:29,982
(Shoes clanking on deck)

739
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:46,900
(Liquid splashing)

740
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:00,998
(Chains clinking)

741
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:17,055
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

742
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:21,143
Here, Jonesy.

743
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:23,228
Jonesy.

744
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:27,482
Kitty, kitty.

745
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:03,352
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

746
01:07:07,465 --> 01:07:09,466
Jonesy?

747
01:07:16,774 --> 01:07:18,909
Hey. Hey. Come on, Jonesy.

748
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:21,286
Come on, baby. That's a kitty.

749
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:24,748
That's a kitty. Come on, baby.

750
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:27,626
- That's a kitty.
- (Hisses)

751
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:31,588
Hey, hey. I'm not gonna hurt you.

752
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:33,674
Come on.

753
01:07:39,413 --> 01:07:41,789
(Snarling)

754
01:07:50,688 --> 01:07:53,288
(Creature hissing)

755
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:56,947
(Screaming)

756
01:08:04,221 --> 01:08:05,538
Brett!

757
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:07,357
Parker: Brett!

758
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:17,301
Parker: Brett!

759
01:08:21,521 --> 01:08:24,521
(Shuddering breath)

760
01:08:26,019 --> 01:08:29,595
Whatever it was, it
was- it was big and

761
01:08:32,317 --> 01:08:34,609
You're sure it took him
into the air shaft?

762
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:36,862
Disappeared into one
of the cooling ducts.

763
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:40,781
No question, it's-it's using
the air ducts to move around.

764
01:08:43,411 --> 01:08:45,579
Could he want Brett alive?

765
01:08:46,814 --> 01:08:49,383
- What? 
- Could Brett be alive?

766
01:08:49,467 --> 01:08:52,336
No. I mean, I don't think so.

767
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:56,340
Well, this air shaft may
work to our advantage.

768
01:08:56,424 --> 01:09:01,219
Here it leads up to and comes
out in the main air lock.

769
01:09:01,304 --> 01:09:03,597
All right. There's only one
big opening along the way.

770
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:07,017
We can cover that up, and then we...

771
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:09,603
drive it into the air lock
and zap it into outer space.

772
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:12,064
This son of a bitch is huge!

773
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:15,525
- I mean, it's like a man, it-it's big!
- Kane's son.

774
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:20,805
Come on, Ash, I mean, science 
department should be able to help us.

775
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:22,866
What can we do to drive it?

776
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:25,243
Yes, well, it's adapted remarkably
well to our atmosphere,

777
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:27,412
considering its nutritional requirements.

778
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:29,098
The only thing we don't 
know about is temperature.

779
01:09:29,111 --> 01:09:31,382
Okay. What about temperature?
What happens if we change it?

780
01:09:31,466 --> 01:09:32,876
Let's try it.

781
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:36,254
I mean, most animals
retreat from fire. Yes?

782
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:38,799
Fire, yeah. Parker, can you rig...

783
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:41,385
three or four incinerator units?

784
01:09:41,769 --> 01:09:44,454
Give me about 20 minutes.
I'll do it.

785
01:09:44,938 --> 01:09:47,106
- Who gets to go into the vent?
- I do.

786
01:09:48,318 --> 01:09:52,070
No. You and Ash...

787
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:54,523
take the main air lock.

788
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:58,402
Parker, Lambert, you cover up
that maintenance opening, please.

789
01:09:58,486 --> 01:10:00,904
Lambert: Right.

790
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:07,911
(Beeping)

791
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:32,587
Dallas: I'm at the first junction.

792
01:10:32,718 --> 01:10:34,318
Dallas, I'm right here.

793
01:10:34,471 --> 01:10:36,066
- Parker?
- Yeah?

794
01:10:36,148 --> 01:10:37,448
(Dallas over radio)
Lambert...

795
01:10:37,550 --> 01:10:40,143
We're in position. I'm just
trying to get a reading here.

796
01:10:40,327 --> 01:10:43,379
- The air lock is open.
- Okay, Ripley.

797
01:10:43,464 --> 01:10:45,032
Ready.

798
01:10:47,117 --> 01:10:49,617
(Hatch grinding shut)

799
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:54,820
Dallas: I'm moving up.

800
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:57,627
All right. I've got a reading on you now.

801
01:10:57,712 --> 01:10:59,713
(Tracker beeping)

802
01:11:13,028 --> 01:11:16,022
Uh, open the hatch to
the third junction.

803
01:11:16,091 --> 01:11:18,091
(Hatch grinds open)

804
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:22,527
(Beeping)

805
01:11:32,497 --> 01:11:35,373
(Beeping continues)
Dallas: Okay, I'm through.

806
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,417
- Ripley?
- Yes.

807
01:11:37,502 --> 01:11:40,295
Close all the hatches behind me.

808
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:42,547
I'm moving on.

809
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:46,079
(Hatch grinds shut)

810
01:11:50,344 --> 01:11:53,344
(Hatch grinding shut)

811
01:11:57,271 --> 01:11:59,681
Lambert: Dallas, hold it a minute.
I mean, I think I got it.

812
01:12:00,907 --> 01:12:04,236
- Yes, I've got it.
Dallas: Where?

813
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:08,073
Lambert: It's somewhere around
the third junction.

814
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,158
Okay, moving on.

815
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:33,056
It is right around there. Now, Dallas,
you're gonna have to be careful.

816
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:47,105
All right. I've reached...

817
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:52,325
the third junction,
and I'm going down.

818
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:55,954
(Sensors beeping)

819
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:00,583
(Beeping)

820
01:13:09,427 --> 01:13:11,762
The hell's the matter with that box?

821
01:13:13,147 --> 01:13:16,541
Dallas, you're gonna have to hold
your position for a minute. I-

822
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:19,468
I've lost the signal.

823
01:13:19,653 --> 01:13:21,571
What? You sure?

824
01:13:21,656 --> 01:13:23,642
Look, look around. Are you 
sure that it's not there?

825
01:13:23,703 --> 01:13:26,403
I mean, It's got to be 
around there somewhere.

826
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:33,992
Dallas: Check that out, Lambert.
You may be getting interference.

827
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:35,910
Lambert: Dallas, are you
sure there's no sign of it?

828
01:13:35,995 --> 01:13:37,507
I mean, it is there.

829
01:13:37,607 --> 01:13:39,307
(Flames whooshing)

830
01:13:39,364 --> 01:13:42,264
 It's gotta be around there.

831
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:44,105
Dallas?

832
01:13:45,429 --> 01:13:47,429
God, what is happening?

833
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:49,883
All right.

834
01:13:55,088 --> 01:13:59,250
Uh, am I-am I clear, Lambert? 
I wanna get the hell out of here.

835
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:00,777
(Beeping)

836
01:14:00,862 --> 01:14:04,046
Lambert: Oh, God. It's
moving right towards you.

837
01:14:05,933 --> 01:14:07,767
Uh...

838
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:16,159
Move! Get out of there!
Behind you! Move!

839
01:14:16,243 --> 01:14:19,329
Dallas! Move, Dallas!
Move, Dallas!

840
01:14:19,413 --> 01:14:22,083
Get out! (Sobbing)

841
01:14:22,167 --> 01:14:24,834
No, not that way, the other way!

842
01:14:24,919 --> 01:14:26,628
(Screeching)

843
01:14:26,754 --> 01:14:28,505
(Shrill feedback)
Dallas?

844
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:30,382
- No.
- Take it easy.

845
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,592
Parker: Dallas?

846
01:14:32,651 --> 01:14:33,851
(Static on radio)

847
01:14:38,099 --> 01:14:40,266
We found this laying there.

848
01:14:41,936 --> 01:14:43,487
No blood...

849
01:14:44,271 --> 01:14:45,590
No Dallas.

850
01:14:47,478 --> 01:14:48,778
Nothing.

851
01:14:52,302 --> 01:14:53,902
(Slams flamethrower down)

852
01:14:53,948 --> 01:14:55,308
How come I don't hear anybody saying

853
01:14:55,413 --> 01:14:57,413
- nothing around this place?
- I'm thinking.

854
01:15:00,095 --> 01:15:04,040
Unless somebody has got a better idea,

855
01:15:04,925 --> 01:15:07,176
we'll proceed with Dallas' plan.

856
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:10,213
What? And end up like the others?

857
01:15:10,297 --> 01:15:12,715
Ohh. No, you're out of your mind.

858
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:17,053
- Got a better idea?
- Yes. I say that we abandon this ship.

859
01:15:17,138 --> 01:15:19,389
We get the shuttle and just
get the hell out of here.

860
01:15:19,473 --> 01:15:22,434
We take our chances
and just hope that...

861
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:24,394
- somebody picks us up.
- Lambert.

862
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:28,231
- The shuttle won't take four.
- Then why don't we draw straws and...

863
01:15:28,315 --> 01:15:31,401
I'm not drawin' any straws. I'm for
killing that goddamn thing right now.

864
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:33,528
Ripley: Okay.

865
01:15:33,553 --> 01:15:35,714
Well, let's talk about killing it.
(Parker grumbling)

866
01:15:35,739 --> 01:15:38,867
We know it's using the air shafts-Will
you listen to me, Parker?

867
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:41,786
- Shut up!
- Let's hear it.

868
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:43,788
Let's hear it.

869
01:15:43,873 --> 01:15:47,083
It's using the air shafts.

870
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:49,961
- We don't know that.
- That's the only way.

871
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:53,131
We'll move in pairs.
We'll go step by step...

872
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:56,134
and cut off every bulkhead
and every vent...

873
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:59,471
until we have it cornered, and then
we'll blow it the fuck out into space.

874
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:01,723
Is that acceptable to you?

875
01:16:01,849 --> 01:16:06,936
- If it means killing it, it's acceptable to me.
- Obviously it means killing it.

876
01:16:07,021 --> 01:16:08,813
But we have to stick together.

877
01:16:10,191 --> 01:16:13,610
- How are our weapons?
- The weapons are fine.

878
01:16:13,736 --> 01:16:17,614
- This one needs... refueling.
- Will you get it, please?

879
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:21,743
- Ash, go with him.
- No, no. I can manage, Ash.

880
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:23,828
Don't follow me.

881
01:16:27,374 --> 01:16:29,375
Ash?

882
01:16:30,669 --> 01:16:33,171
Any suggestions from you or Mother?

883
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:37,768
No, we're still collating.

884
01:16:39,053 --> 01:16:41,304
(Laughs) You're what?

885
01:16:41,388 --> 01:16:43,598
You're still collating?

886
01:16:44,282 --> 01:16:46,726
I find that hard to believe.

887
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:51,940
- What would you like me to do?
- Just what you've been doing, Ash.

888
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:54,984
Nothing. I've got
access to Mother now,

889
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:58,029
and I'll get my own
answers, thank you.

890
01:17:00,658 --> 01:17:03,201
All right.

891
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:18,675
(Clicking, beeping)

892
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:30,353
(Whirring)

893
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:34,397
(Keyboard beeping)

894
01:17:48,804 --> 01:17:50,804
(Clacking)

895
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:44,385
There is an explanation for this, you know.

896
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:48,473
Is there really? I don't wanna
hear your goddamn explanation!

897
01:18:50,601 --> 01:18:53,770
(Sobbing) I want-I want

898
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:59,400
(Sobbing) I want-I w...

899
01:19:05,824 --> 01:19:08,951
Parker. Lambert?

900
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:20,588
Ash, open the door.

901
01:19:30,224 --> 01:19:32,225
Ash.

902
01:19:36,146 --> 01:19:38,147
Will you open the door?

903
01:19:41,785 --> 01:19:44,585
- Let me by, Ash.
(Giggling)

904
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:51,577
(Screams)

905
01:19:58,301 --> 01:20:00,301
Oh! (Grunts)

906
01:20:14,435 --> 01:20:17,395
(Jingling)

907
01:20:19,148 --> 01:20:21,149
- Yaah!
(Groans)

908
01:20:56,267 --> 01:20:58,685
(Muffled shouts)

909
01:20:59,589 --> 01:21:01,589
(Ash jibbering)

910
01:21:05,127 --> 01:21:07,628
What the hell are you doing?

911
01:21:08,384 --> 01:21:12,244
(Muffled shouting continues)

912
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:16,829
Aah!

913
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:29,133
Get her up. Get her up. Get her up.
Get her up. Get her up. Get her up.

914
01:21:29,218 --> 01:21:33,221
(Chittering)

915
01:21:40,521 --> 01:21:42,855
Android! He's an android!

916
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:57,578
(Screeching)

917
01:21:57,663 --> 01:21:59,664
Jesus!

918
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:06,128
Parker: It's a robot.
Ash is a goddamn robot!

919
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:10,299
God!

920
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:16,430
Parker: Oh! Get off me-Oh!

921
01:22:16,515 --> 01:22:18,474
Holy shit!

922
01:22:18,559 --> 01:22:23,020
Help! Help me get this
fucking thing off!

923
01:22:23,105 --> 01:22:25,106
(Screaming)

924
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:29,235
Aah!

925
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:32,947
God! Jesus! Oh, God! Oh, God!

926
01:22:37,661 --> 01:22:40,621
Parker: How come the company
sent us a goddamn robot?

927
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:42,570
Ripley: All I can think
of is they must've

928
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:44,458
wanted the alien for
their weapons division.

929
01:22:44,543 --> 01:22:47,336
He's been protecting it right along.

930
01:22:47,421 --> 01:22:49,672
Parker, will you plug it in?

931
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:54,677
Parker: Umm... I don't know why...
- Because he may know how to kill it.

932
01:23:19,911 --> 01:23:22,413
Ripley: Ash, can you hear me?

933
01:23:25,584 --> 01:23:27,501
Ash?

934
01:23:34,635 --> 01:23:37,386
(Distorted voice)
Yes, I can hear you.

935
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:47,396
- What was your special order?
- You read it. I thought it was clear.

936
01:23:47,481 --> 01:23:51,484
- What was it?
- Bring back life-form.

937
01:23:51,568 --> 01:23:56,238
Priority one. All other
priorities rescinded.

938
01:23:59,242 --> 01:24:03,954
The damn company! What about
our lives, you son of a bitch?

939
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:08,000
I repeat: All other
priorities are rescinded.

940
01:24:08,085 --> 01:24:10,461
Ripley: How do we kill it, Ash?

941
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:13,964
There's got to be a way of
killing it. How-How do we do it?

942
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:16,842
You can't.

943
01:24:16,927 --> 01:24:19,667
That's bullshit!
- You still don't

944
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:22,431
understand what you're
dealing with, do you?

945
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:26,394
A perfect organism.

946
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:32,817
Its structural perfection is
matched only by its hostility.

947
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:35,111
You admire it.

948
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:41,283
I admire its purity.

949
01:24:45,622 --> 01:24:47,540
A survivor...

950
01:24:49,626 --> 01:24:53,879
unclouded by conscience,

951
01:24:53,964 --> 01:24:57,633
remorse or delusions of morality.

952
01:24:59,594 --> 01:25:02,263
Parker: Look, I-I've
heard enough of this,

953
01:25:02,347 --> 01:25:04,765
and I'm asking you to pull the plug.

954
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:08,185
Ash: Last word.
- What?

955
01:25:10,021 --> 01:25:14,066
I can't lie to you about
your chances, but...

956
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:19,739
you have my sympathies.

957
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:25,202
We're gonna blow up the ship.

958
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:28,038
We'll take our chances in the shuttle.

959
01:25:28,165 --> 01:25:30,499
Blow up the ship. Good.

960
01:25:30,584 --> 01:25:32,585
Come on.

961
01:25:59,112 --> 01:26:02,239
When we throw the switches, 
how long before the ship blows?

962
01:26:02,365 --> 01:26:03,992
- Ten minutes.
- No bullshit.

963
01:26:04,067 --> 01:26:05,767
If we ain't outta 
here in ten minutes,

964
01:26:05,776 --> 01:26:08,087
we won't need no rocket
to fly through space.

965
01:26:08,871 --> 01:26:12,040
We're gonna need coolant for
the air support system.

966
01:26:17,930 --> 01:26:20,599
You two go down, get all
the coolant you can carry.

967
01:26:20,683 --> 01:26:23,602
I'll get the shuttle ready.
I'll give you about...

968
01:26:23,986 --> 01:26:26,279
about seven minutes.

969
01:26:26,363 --> 01:26:28,740
Come back up here. I'll
shut the switches off,

970
01:26:28,824 --> 01:26:30,700
and we'll blow this
fucker off into space.

971
01:26:30,784 --> 01:26:32,744
Okay. All right. Come on.

972
01:26:32,828 --> 01:26:34,446
Ready? Take care of yourself.

973
01:26:34,530 --> 01:26:36,656

980
01:28:46,696 --> 01:28:48,197

981
01:28:49,616 --> 01:28:51,241
Kitty.
(Tapping fingers)

982
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:53,285

Okay. Go ahead.

983
01:28:55,455 --> 01:28:57,581
Jones?

984
01:29:01,795 --> 01:29:04,546
Psst! Psst! Psst! Psst! Kitty,

985
01:29:04,631 --> 01:29:07,007

Come here, boy.

Come here.

989
01:29:17,435 --> 01:29:19,853

(Rattling) Jones?

992
01:29:28,738 --> 01:29:31,532
Come here. Come here, sweetheart.

01:29:32,784 --> 01:29:34,576
Jones.

994
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:45,671

Get out of the way, Lambert!
It's gonna kill us!

1003
01:30:42,645 --> 01:30:45,397
I can't!

1004
01:30:45,523 --> 01:30:48,692
