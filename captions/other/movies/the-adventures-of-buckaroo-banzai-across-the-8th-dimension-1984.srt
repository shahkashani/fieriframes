2
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:43,695
Launch control is having trouble
verifying mass acceleration.

3
00:01:43,863 --> 00:01:48,075
Team Banzai rotational supervisor,
please confirm.

4
00:01:49,535 --> 00:01:53,664
I want an electromagnetic
fuel reading from the launch.

5
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,087
We are T minus seven zero and holding.

6
00:02:00,213 --> 00:02:04,341
Antigravity inertia reversal crosscheck.

7
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:09,388
Can we have a photographic
printout to the bunker?

8
00:02:09,514 --> 00:02:14,893
T minus six zero three and holding.
Phaser positive. Latch compressor.

9
00:02:15,395 --> 00:02:19,273
Multistage
axial compressor... latched.

10
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:23,610
Fuel pressure... 1800 torrs.

11
00:02:23,736 --> 00:02:29,574
Commence pullback to
the launch sequence. Clear the launch.

12
00:02:32,245 --> 00:02:35,372
Specific density is 2.5. Over.

13
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,792
You're kidding. He's still at the hospital?

14
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:42,504
Banzai hasn't showed yet, Mr. Secretary.

15
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,465
Looks like he's got cold feet.

16
00:02:45,591 --> 00:02:49,177
Well, better go see what's
keeping the boss, Reno.

17
00:02:49,304 --> 00:02:51,763
Why me?

18
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:53,640
Cos I'm busy.

19
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,352
May I have the curved Yasargil, please?

20
00:02:57,478 --> 00:02:59,855
It's not here, Dr. Banzai.

21
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:02,482
Ah, let me have the straight one then.

22
00:03:02,608 --> 00:03:05,018
See, this is the part where for me
it started looking like a problem.

23
00:03:05,028 --> 00:03:09,281
I mean, I wanted to sacrifice the precentral
vein in order to get some exposure.

24
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:12,859
But because of this guy's normal variation,
I got excited and all the sudden I didn't know

25
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:16,612
whether I was looking at the precentral vein or one
of the internal cerebro veins or the Vein of Galen

26
00:03:16,622 --> 00:03:20,825
or the Basilar vein of Rosenthal, so one my own me at
this point I was ready to say "That's it, let's get out".

27
00:03:20,835 --> 00:03:23,920
See, you can check
your anatomy all you want,

28
00:03:24,047 --> 00:03:26,831
and even though there may be normal
variation, if you get right down to it,

29
00:03:26,841 --> 00:03:29,676
this far inside the head,
it all looks the same.

30
00:03:29,802 --> 00:03:32,888
No, no, no. Don't tug on that.
You never know what it might be attached to.

31
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:39,895
This is control.
02 vents are closed. Looks good.

32
00:03:40,396 --> 00:03:43,857
Dr. Banzai is using the laser
to vaporize a pineal tumor

33
00:03:43,983 --> 00:03:46,651
without damaging
the quadrigeminal plate.

34
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:49,738
Subcutaneous microphone gonna
allow the patient to transmit

35
00:03:49,822 --> 00:03:52,366
verbal instructions to his own brain.

36
00:03:52,492 --> 00:03:57,245
- Like "Raise my left arm"?
- Or "Throw the harpoon".

37
00:03:57,372 --> 00:04:00,415
People are gonna come from all over.
This boy's an Eskimo.

38
00:04:01,334 --> 00:04:04,669
You ever thought about
joining me full time?

39
00:04:04,837 --> 00:04:06,957
What do you mean? You serious?
Do you have an opening?

40
00:04:07,006 --> 00:04:10,884
Uh-huh. Can you sing?

41
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,762
A little. Yeah. I can dance.

42
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,430
Hey, it's Buckaroo.

43
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:18,642
We have Buckaroo descending.
We have him on the launch parameter.

44
00:04:18,768 --> 00:04:24,606
Inertial control positive.
T minus five four five. Resume counting.

45
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:26,400
Hey, hey, Rawhide!

46
00:04:26,526 --> 00:04:30,529
All systems righteous.
Professor Hikita says we have a go.

47
00:04:40,706 --> 00:04:45,460
I'm teeing off in an hour and a half.
What's this jalopy supposed to do anyway?

48
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:49,297
- 500 miles an hour, General.
- Oh, Senator, you're so gullible.

49
00:04:54,387 --> 00:04:58,849
Please clear the launch grid.
Please clear the launch grid.

50
00:05:02,645 --> 00:05:06,345
HB 88, this is control.
Driver's door check secure.

51
00:05:06,482 --> 00:05:10,282
<i>- ...B, C, D, E...</i>
- Clear the area!

52
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,366
Control, this is HB 88.
Commander's voice check. Over.

53
00:05:16,492 --> 00:05:18,743
Roger, HB 88. Read you. Out.

54
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:22,664
Control, this is HB 88.
Event timer started. Over.

55
00:05:22,748 --> 00:05:26,293
HB 88, this is control.
APU start is go.

56
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:28,837
You are on your
on-board computer. Over.

57
00:05:28,963 --> 00:05:30,338
Roger, I copy.

58
00:05:30,465 --> 00:05:35,469
- Altimeters? Compasses?
- Set and crosschecked.

59
00:05:37,763 --> 00:05:40,640
- Reserve brake system two?
- Closed and guarded.

60
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:42,559
- Gear handle?
- Down and in.

61
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:44,895
- Throttles and start levers?
- Closed, off.

62
00:05:45,021 --> 00:05:48,398
- Number four electric hydraulic pump and press?
- On and checked.

63
00:05:48,524 --> 00:05:50,317
- Parking brake?
- Set. Press checked.

64
00:05:50,443 --> 00:05:53,904
- Radios, radar and transponder?
- Set and stand by.

65
00:05:59,744 --> 00:06:03,663
HB 88, this is control.
IMU alignment in progress.

66
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:06,541
We show 28 degrees, 36 minutes.

67
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:12,172
30.32 seconds north...
by 80 degrees, 36 minutes.

68
00:06:12,298 --> 00:06:16,176
- 14.8 seconds west.
- Synchro is aligned.

69
00:06:16,302 --> 00:06:20,305
HB 88, this is control.
Ground crew secure. Over.

70
00:06:45,915 --> 00:06:50,085
- INS ram coordinates.
- Form one, fuel ticket?

71
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:53,296
- On board.
- Circuit breakers?

72
00:06:53,422 --> 00:06:57,008
Point of no return. Five, four, three...

73
00:06:57,176 --> 00:07:00,303
We have main engine start.
...two, one.

74
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,400
Electronuclear carburation seems fine.

75
00:07:15,111 --> 00:07:21,032
He's fast. I'll give Banzai that. But one
heat-seeking missile and he's history.

76
00:07:21,158 --> 00:07:24,786
This is control. APU start is go.

77
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:28,665
You're on your on-board computer. Over.

78
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:33,587
They are reading you on the localizer
downrange. Looks good. Over.

79
00:07:33,713 --> 00:07:35,797
HB 88, this is control.

80
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:40,552
Speed steady at 317 nautical.
400 and accelerating!

81
00:07:42,638 --> 00:07:46,057
Horizontal velocity is expanding. Over.

82
00:07:50,062 --> 00:07:52,647
- Four... three...
- Here he comes.

83
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:55,692
...two... one.

84
00:07:55,818 --> 00:07:58,486
- Where's he going?
- Yeah!

85
00:08:00,448 --> 00:08:03,366
He is off course.
This is Chase One. Over.

86
00:08:03,534 --> 00:08:05,327
He has broken trajectory...

87
00:08:05,453 --> 00:08:09,539
50 cylinder. There is an immediate
fire hazard. Do you read?

88
00:08:09,707 --> 00:08:11,708
- Roger.
- Do you read?

89
00:08:11,834 --> 00:08:15,754
Advise you abort. Over.
Repeat: Advise you cancel phase two!

90
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,633
- What the hell's phase two?
- That's a big no-can-do.

91
00:08:23,137 --> 00:08:26,598
Buckaroo, are you decompressing? Over.

92
00:08:27,433 --> 00:08:30,602
- He's broken the sound barrier!
- Mach 1 .3.

93
00:08:30,728 --> 00:08:35,065
Buckaroo, do you read?
Commence braking procedure. Over.

94
00:08:35,191 --> 00:08:37,609
Just be cool. She'll hold.

95
00:08:38,903 --> 00:08:41,821
Axis negative.
Pneumatic pressure negative.

96
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:44,324
We are looking at 500 degrees...

97
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:48,161
We are in pursuit.
He is gaining. Over.

98
00:08:48,287 --> 00:08:50,705
He's headed for the mountains!

99
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:52,415
Eject, Buckaroo! Eject!

100
00:08:54,752 --> 00:09:00,173
HB 88, do you read? Do you read? Over.
This is control. Do you read?

101
00:09:01,676 --> 00:09:04,094
Unsafe levels of...

102
00:09:04,887 --> 00:09:08,515
Standby recirculation has been activated.

103
00:09:10,476 --> 00:09:13,436
HB 88, this is control. Do you...

104
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:21,361
Hotel Brava 88 do you read?
Do you read? Over.

105
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:26,700
- What is going on?
- It's off my scope.

106
00:09:35,084 --> 00:09:39,003
This is Chase One. We got his tracks.
They go right up to a wall of rock.

107
00:09:39,171 --> 00:09:40,755
Holy shit!

108
00:10:13,414 --> 00:10:18,543
This is Chase Two. Chase Two.
We see him. We see him.

109
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:22,422
We have him. Chase Two reports
a visual 100 miles off course.

110
00:10:22,548 --> 00:10:23,465
Banzai!

111
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:28,720
He's gone through it.
He's gone through the mountain.

112
00:10:28,846 --> 00:10:31,097
It has deployed there.

113
00:10:33,184 --> 00:10:37,020
There is a minimal disturbance
in the electromagnetic field.

114
00:10:37,146 --> 00:10:40,023
Antigravity inertia is normal.

115
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:43,735
Mass acceleration is diminishing. Over.

116
00:10:43,903 --> 00:10:45,487
He is OK.

117
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:50,200
The vehicle is hot, but we are
showing no radioactivity. Over.

118
00:10:50,367 --> 00:10:55,288
HB 88, this is control. We see you.
Welcome home. Over.

119
00:10:55,414 --> 00:10:58,833
We show electrical-field aberrations
on the windshield.

120
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:04,380
We are getting a localized vibration
of the drive train and a minor oil leak.

121
00:11:04,465 --> 00:11:07,383
Buckaroo, can you verify
operational capability?

122
00:11:13,808 --> 00:11:15,183
HB 88, this is control.

123
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:18,603
We are reading an electrical
field aberration of 993

124
00:11:18,729 --> 00:11:22,816
on your windshield, static and fracture.
Can you confirm? Over.

125
00:11:33,452 --> 00:11:36,788
HB 88, this is control.
Do you hear me? Over.

126
00:11:36,914 --> 00:11:42,877
We are getting localized vibration on
your drive shaft. Can you verify? Over.

127
00:11:52,972 --> 00:11:58,518
HB 88, a retrieval vehicle
will rendezvous in ten minutes. Over.

128
00:12:08,988 --> 00:12:13,283
Well, there it is,
tire tracks right up to a wall of rock.

129
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:17,036
Perfect Tommy, Rawhide, Reno -

130
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:22,166
cute guys of the Hong Kong Cavaliers,
Buckaroo's most trusted inner circle.

131
00:12:23,085 --> 00:12:27,046
Could you elaborate on that device,
I believe, dubbed the "oscillator"...

132
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:30,717
- Oscillation overthruster.
- Hikita!

133
00:12:30,843 --> 00:12:34,762
- Thank you, Allison.
- That dirty little Asian critter!

134
00:12:38,851 --> 00:12:44,272
Tranquillizers are being dispensed
to all patients between 10 and 11 am,

135
00:12:44,398 --> 00:12:47,901
Tuesday, Friday and Wednesday.

136
00:12:55,534 --> 00:12:59,621
The sound barrier crumbles,
and then the dimension barrier.

137
00:12:59,747 --> 00:13:06,210
It was, Buckaroo Banzai said, exactly like
Professor Hikita had glimpsed in 1938

138
00:13:06,378 --> 00:13:12,050
through the overthruster he and Dr. Emilio
Lizardo put together from spare parts

139
00:13:12,176 --> 00:13:14,469
in a laboratory at Princeton.

140
00:13:14,595 --> 00:13:19,599
1938. Can you imagine what it
must have been like then?

141
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:33,696
Molto grazie, Dr. Lizardo.

142
00:13:34,365 --> 00:13:38,701
Almost ready, Dr. Lizardo! Almost.

143
00:14:00,391 --> 00:14:03,685
Electromagnets, they are charging.

144
00:14:03,852 --> 00:14:06,562
Catapult, she's wired!

145
00:14:07,356 --> 00:14:11,109
No. Not yet. No!

146
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:13,778
Whoo!

147
00:14:14,822 --> 00:14:17,365
No, not yet! Not yet! I'm not ready!

148
00:14:38,387 --> 00:14:41,639
He did not go through the wall.

149
00:14:48,022 --> 00:14:50,106
Holy Toledo!

150
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:57,864
Facile. Sotto, dottor.

151
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:10,501
Emilio?

152
00:15:30,272 --> 00:15:33,024
...asked what he saw,
asked where he went,

153
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:38,696
Dr. Banzai replied "Vast chasms
of hissing swamp, spurts of flame,

154
00:15:38,822 --> 00:15:42,283
huge thunderclaps
and gurgling rock formations."

155
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:47,830
Lithium is no longer
available on credit.

156
00:15:51,752 --> 00:15:54,337
G-sub-E...

157
00:15:54,505 --> 00:15:59,425
Gesù Cristo, make the ganglia twitch.
We're home free.

158
00:15:59,593 --> 00:16:05,556
Home... home is where
you wear your hat.

159
00:16:05,682 --> 00:16:10,019
I feel so break up, I want to go home!

160
00:16:10,145 --> 00:16:14,565
Hello, Doc. Who are we today?
Albert Einstein?

161
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:17,693
No. Lord John Whorfin.

162
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:21,697
If there's one thing I hate,
it's to be mistaken for somebody else.

163
00:16:21,824 --> 00:16:26,953
Cheer up, Lizardo. It's Friday. I got
a care package from your yo-yo friends.

164
00:16:27,663 --> 00:16:30,706
Hey, Signore...

165
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,084
grazie tanto.

166
00:16:33,252 --> 00:16:35,211
Thanks, Doc.

167
00:16:35,337 --> 00:16:38,506
I come for your TV.
You've been using too much juice.

168
00:16:38,674 --> 00:16:41,676
Another 10,000 kilowatts
again this month.

169
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,929
It beats me how an old homicidal
loony can use that much power.

170
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,932
Go on, take it! I don't need it!

171
00:16:48,058 --> 00:16:53,855
Tomorrow I'm goin' home
with my overthruster.

172
00:16:56,525 --> 00:16:58,609
That's terrific, Doc.

173
00:16:58,777 --> 00:17:02,113
I'll make sure you get
an early wake-up call.

174
00:17:04,116 --> 00:17:07,368
Laugh while you can, monkey boy.

175
00:17:18,046 --> 00:17:21,799
Buckaroo, I've done
a spectrographic analysis

176
00:17:21,925 --> 00:17:26,095
on the specimen you pulled
off the jet car drive shaft.

177
00:17:27,222 --> 00:17:29,015
Rawhide, what do you think?

178
00:17:29,141 --> 00:17:31,350
I don't care if you walked
through a mountain in Texas.

179
00:17:31,476 --> 00:17:36,314
This is New Jersey, and when you
play my joint, you're just another act.

180
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,319
- I want some music out of you.
- You want it, Artie? You got it.

181
00:17:45,407 --> 00:17:46,490
Let's rock and roll!

182
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:55,791
Ladies and gentlemen, Artie's Artery
is proud to present for a single night only,

183
00:17:55,876 --> 00:17:59,629
New Brunswick's own,
the one, the only, the amazing...

184
00:17:59,755 --> 00:18:03,674
Buckaroo Banzai and
the Hong Kong Cavaliers!

185
00:19:14,705 --> 00:19:16,622
Excuse me.

186
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,794
Excuse me, is someone out there
not having a good time?

187
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:28,467
Is somebody...

188
00:19:28,593 --> 00:19:30,970
is somebody crying...

189
00:19:31,096 --> 00:19:33,389
out there in the darkness?

190
00:19:34,308 --> 00:19:36,183
Somebody crying?

191
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:39,729
Over here. I'm sorry.

192
00:19:40,856 --> 00:19:46,694
Um, could we get... could we
get her a mike and a spotlight?

193
00:19:46,862 --> 00:19:49,780
Tommy, could we run her a mike?

194
00:19:50,907 --> 00:19:55,036
- What, are you serious?
- Yeah, run her over a mike.

195
00:19:57,956 --> 00:20:00,291
What's your name?

196
00:20:00,417 --> 00:20:02,501
- Who cares?
- Right.

197
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:05,087
Well, I care. What's your name?

198
00:20:09,885 --> 00:20:12,470
- Penny.
- Did you say Peggy?

199
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,557
No. My name's Penny. Penny Priddy.

200
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:21,604
That doesn't matter.
It's not important.

201
00:20:22,272 --> 00:20:28,194
I just... I just sponged up
a little too much Vat 69, that's all.

202
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:32,615
I'm down to my last nickel
in this lousy town,

203
00:20:32,741 --> 00:20:35,159
and they wouldn't take
my luggage in hock.

204
00:20:35,243 --> 00:20:37,787
I lost my room at the Y this morning.

205
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,918
But it's cool.

206
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:47,546
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, now.

207
00:20:47,672 --> 00:20:50,007
Don't be mean.

208
00:20:50,133 --> 00:20:54,428
We don't have to be mean,
cos, remember...

209
00:20:55,013 --> 00:20:59,892
no matter where you go...
there you are.

210
00:21:17,536 --> 00:21:22,957
- I'm gonna sing this song for you, Peggy.
- No, Penny! Who cares?

211
00:21:28,547 --> 00:21:36,220
I don't have plans and schemes...

212
00:21:36,346 --> 00:21:38,973
And I...

213
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:44,019
Don't have hopes and dreams...

214
00:21:44,146 --> 00:21:50,901
I don't have anything...

215
00:21:51,027 --> 00:21:52,778
- This is weird.
- Sure is.

216
00:21:52,904 --> 00:21:58,242
Since I don't have you...

217
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:02,538
- Yeah, I...
- Who's the girl?

218
00:22:02,664 --> 00:22:07,668
Don't have fond desires...

219
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:15,301
I don't have happy hours...

220
00:22:15,427 --> 00:22:22,600
I don't have anything...

221
00:22:29,357 --> 00:22:33,903
- Get her outta here now! Let's go!
- Let me go! Let me go, you freaks!

222
00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:37,948
- Wait. Wait a minute. Wait.
- Kill that spot. Kill it!

223
00:22:42,579 --> 00:22:47,291
...festive briefing by the
Banzai Institute. Tomorrow...

224
00:22:48,168 --> 00:22:50,211
Where you think you're going, Doc? The moon?

225
00:22:50,337 --> 00:22:53,714
- No, no. Planet Ten.
- Planet Ten. Why, pray tell?

226
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,841
- Operator?
- Doc, put down the phone.

227
00:22:55,967 --> 00:23:00,721
Operator? I wanna make a call
to a Mr. John Bigbooty

228
00:23:00,889 --> 00:23:06,268
at Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems
over in Grover's Mill.

229
00:23:06,394 --> 00:23:09,980
And you tell him that
it's John Whorfin calling.

230
00:23:10,065 --> 00:23:13,442
That's W-H-O-R-F-I-N.
You got that, honey?

231
00:23:13,568 --> 00:23:17,530
- John. J-O-H-N.
- This better be collect, Doc.

232
00:23:24,204 --> 00:23:30,042
Bigbooty? Of course it's me, you fool!
Who do you think?

233
00:23:30,168 --> 00:23:32,586
The time has come, Bigbooty.

234
00:23:32,754 --> 00:23:35,130
Prepare for my return.

235
00:23:36,508 --> 00:23:39,260
Well, haven't you heard?
Don't you watch TV?

236
00:23:39,386 --> 00:23:45,140
Banzai and Hikita have done it.
They have opened the window!

237
00:23:46,101 --> 00:23:50,479
Si. Si. So meet me at the factory.

238
00:23:50,647 --> 00:23:53,732
And get their overthruster.

239
00:23:53,817 --> 00:23:55,776
And Hikita, too.

240
00:23:55,944 --> 00:23:58,237
Sure. Alive.

241
00:23:58,405 --> 00:24:02,992
No, no, don't worry about me.
I'll get my own ride.

242
00:24:11,001 --> 00:24:16,046
Evil will not prevail. That was...

243
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:22,011
Arrivederci, Jersey.

244
00:24:22,178 --> 00:24:25,431
Goodbye, goodbye to her...

245
00:24:31,438 --> 00:24:35,274
- It's the spittin' image.
- Doesn't look anything like her.

246
00:24:35,442 --> 00:24:37,234
Pictures don't lie.

247
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,530
Hell they don't. Met my first wife that way.

248
00:24:42,365 --> 00:24:46,368
It's Peggy to these eyes. It's the
same nose. It's the same hair.

249
00:24:46,536 --> 00:24:49,413
Plus, Buckaroo has to think so too
or else he wouldn't be ready

250
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:51,790
to make a fool of himself.

251
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:01,050
Just hot off the World Watch Wire, Buckaroo.
Thought you'd wanna be notified.

252
00:25:01,176 --> 00:25:04,053
Remember that old Italian pal
of the Professor's?

253
00:25:04,179 --> 00:25:05,763
- Emilio Lizardo.
- Yeah.

254
00:25:05,889 --> 00:25:09,975
Last night he kills a guard, breaks out of
Trenton Home for the Criminally Insane.

255
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:13,687
Ten minutes later, he cops a Maserati
Bora. Totaled it a block away.

256
00:25:13,855 --> 00:25:15,064
Holy Moly.

257
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:18,776
- Maserati Bora.
- Mm-hm. That ain't all.

258
00:25:19,402 --> 00:25:21,654
He's vanished. Thin air.

259
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:27,534
- Dr. Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?
- You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.

260
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:30,621
This guy is a
top scientist, Dummkopf.

261
00:25:30,747 --> 00:25:36,043
- So was Mr. Wizard.
- Dr. Emilio Lizardo is a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy.

262
00:25:36,211 --> 00:25:40,255
A vicious psychopath.
Just as soon kill you as go fishin'.

263
00:25:45,095 --> 00:25:47,262
Buckaroo, look at this.

264
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:51,517
Grossly-abnormal high-altitude
electrostatic disturbance

265
00:25:51,601 --> 00:25:54,978
- moving down over Connecticut.
- From the jet car, do you think?

266
00:25:55,105 --> 00:25:58,065
No, not from the jet car.
Check with NORAD Command.

267
00:25:58,233 --> 00:26:03,278
It could be above-ground atomic testing
in China. Maybe sunspot activity.

268
00:26:03,405 --> 00:26:04,822
Man, that's strange.

269
00:26:08,576 --> 00:26:10,994
Scientists at Strategious Space Command have detected

270
00:26:11,121 --> 00:26:15,124
a mysterious radioactive cloud-like
mass over southern New England.

271
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:19,586
Sources close to the National Security
Consortium have refused to comment.

272
00:26:19,671 --> 00:26:25,342
Let's get on back to three
great modern country hits in a row.

273
00:26:28,513 --> 00:26:29,638
- Sidney!
- Buckaroo!

274
00:26:29,806 --> 00:26:32,266
- How's the patient?
- Fine, thanks to you.

275
00:26:32,392 --> 00:26:34,472
- But more importantly: Congratulations!
- Thank you.

276
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:37,062
You drove right through
a mountain the other day.

277
00:26:37,188 --> 00:26:40,181
You did it right after you left me at the operation.
You haven't even said anything about it.

278
00:26:40,191 --> 00:26:42,359
- Didn't mention it.
- Sidney, these are my friends.

279
00:26:42,527 --> 00:26:46,196
This is my colleague Dr. Sidney Zwibel, old
medical friend from Columbia P and S.

280
00:26:46,322 --> 00:26:48,690
- Howdy. How you're doing?
- Listen, Sidney, I'm glad you could make it.

281
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,192
Cos it looks like we may need an
extra hand sooner than I thought.

282
00:26:51,202 --> 00:26:53,245
Aha, I see. That's what I was wondering about.

283
00:26:53,371 --> 00:26:56,915
I got your message about rendezvousing
at this address. Barely had time to pack.

284
00:26:57,041 --> 00:26:59,334
- Then I came here...
- I can see that.

285
00:26:59,502 --> 00:27:01,920
I'm gonna snoop around.
Make yourself at home.

286
00:27:05,341 --> 00:27:08,010
You know, I thought we were gonna
rehearse or something.

287
00:27:08,344 --> 00:27:11,930
I'm a big fan of all you guys. I love
the comic books and the records.

288
00:27:12,056 --> 00:27:13,891
I know you. You're Pecos.

289
00:27:14,017 --> 00:27:17,394
- Perfect Tommy.
- Perfect Tommy. I'm sorry.

290
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,023
- You're Pecos.
- Pecos is in Tibet. Name's Reno.

291
00:27:21,191 --> 00:27:23,859
- Reno! It's an honor.
- Where do you hail from, Doc?

292
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:27,529
- Uh, New Jersey. Fort Lee.
- Where are your spurs at?

293
00:27:27,697 --> 00:27:29,114
Is he making fun of me?

294
00:27:32,368 --> 00:27:35,287
Third cell to the left. Pink dress.

295
00:27:35,413 --> 00:27:37,039
Arigato.

296
00:27:48,551 --> 00:27:53,305
What do you want? Huh?
What are you doin' here?

297
00:27:53,389 --> 00:27:56,642
What are you doing here?

298
00:27:56,768 --> 00:27:59,645
Why don't you just go away
and let me rot?

299
00:28:02,232 --> 00:28:05,567
Who were you really trying
to annihilate last night?

300
00:28:06,569 --> 00:28:10,322
You. Just like the papers all say.

301
00:28:12,909 --> 00:28:15,035
Come over here.

302
00:28:16,621 --> 00:28:19,206
Come on.

303
00:28:19,332 --> 00:28:23,627
Oh, my God! Perfect Tommy!

304
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:30,717
What do you want from me?

305
00:28:33,012 --> 00:28:37,683
Oh, you remind me of someone
I once knew long ago.

306
00:28:41,855 --> 00:28:44,273
Was she very beautiful?

307
00:28:45,775 --> 00:28:49,820
She was... queen of the Netherlands.

308
00:28:49,946 --> 00:28:52,364
That's a long way
from where I come from.

309
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:55,993
Wyoming? Cody, Wyoming?

310
00:28:56,953 --> 00:28:59,830
No, I'm from Laramie.

311
00:28:59,956 --> 00:29:02,833
Except that I was born in Cody,
but nobody...

312
00:29:03,501 --> 00:29:06,211
Do you have family?
Back in Cody, I mean?

313
00:29:06,337 --> 00:29:08,547
I don't know.

314
00:29:08,673 --> 00:29:12,676
See, I always felt that there was
another part of me somewhere.

315
00:29:12,844 --> 00:29:15,095
Another part of you?

316
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:17,598
Somewhere, yeah.

317
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:20,726
I'm adopted.

318
00:29:20,852 --> 00:29:22,686
Of course!

319
00:29:22,854 --> 00:29:26,023
If it was a snake, it'd have bit me!

320
00:29:26,107 --> 00:29:28,483
- Another you.
- Anything's possible.

321
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:31,236
- Let her out!
- Hey, me too.

322
00:29:31,362 --> 00:29:34,781
- Let her out?
- Yeah, let her out. I'll be responsible.

323
00:29:34,908 --> 00:29:38,035
- She's a killer!
- No, she's not. And give her your coat.

324
00:29:38,703 --> 00:29:40,662
Why me?

325
00:29:40,788 --> 00:29:42,998
Because you're perfect.

326
00:29:44,959 --> 00:29:46,668
You have a point there.

327
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:54,426
I'd like to move this thing along.

328
00:29:54,552 --> 00:29:59,264
Perhaps some of you noticed we have
a motorcycle convention rolling in here.

329
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:01,808
We're a little short of time.

330
00:30:01,976 --> 00:30:05,562
Besides, I don't imagine you
came here to listen to me talk.

331
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,814
You're right.

332
00:30:11,736 --> 00:30:15,155
Without further ado, I'd like
to introduce a young man

333
00:30:15,323 --> 00:30:20,535
who yesterday took our notions
of reality and turned them inside out.

334
00:30:20,662 --> 00:30:24,915
Dr. Buckaroo Banzai,
perhaps you can explain yourself.

335
00:30:29,337 --> 00:30:30,629
Ooh.

336
00:30:31,089 --> 00:30:35,634
Secretary, Senator Cunningham...
members of the world press.

337
00:30:36,094 --> 00:30:40,597
30 years ago, almost to this day, my mother and
father, Doctors Sandra and Masado Banzai

338
00:30:40,765 --> 00:30:44,518
gave their lives for what was then
considered to be a very insane notion...

339
00:30:44,644 --> 00:30:49,147
the possibility of contacting alien life.

340
00:30:49,273 --> 00:30:54,027
However, not on another planet. But here.

341
00:30:54,153 --> 00:30:57,447
Maybe right inside this table...

342
00:30:57,615 --> 00:31:01,868
living on a simultaneous plane
of existence with our own.

343
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:04,955
Perhaps within a mountain.

344
00:31:06,874 --> 00:31:10,293
See this rock? It's solid matter, right?

345
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:15,340
But the solid parts of this rock - the
neutrons, quarks, protons and electrons -

346
00:31:15,466 --> 00:31:16,967
comprise only about

347
00:31:17,093 --> 00:31:19,928
one quadrillionth of its total volume.

348
00:31:20,054 --> 00:31:22,264
- How many zeros is that?
- Quite a few.

349
00:31:23,182 --> 00:31:25,767
The rest of this rock
is actually empty space.

350
00:31:25,893 --> 00:31:29,604
So, back in 1937, Professor Hikita here
and Dr. Emilio Lizardo

351
00:31:29,731 --> 00:31:33,275
figured that if solid matter
were mostly just empty space,

352
00:31:33,401 --> 00:31:37,696
a person should be able to discover
a way to travel inside things.

353
00:31:37,822 --> 00:31:42,117
We at the Banzai Institute
have at last found that way.

354
00:31:42,243 --> 00:31:45,078
We have created a device

355
00:31:45,204 --> 00:31:48,704
called an oscillation overthruster,

356
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:52,627
which systematically reorders matter

357
00:31:52,795 --> 00:31:57,257
by annihilating electrons, positrons...

358
00:31:57,383 --> 00:32:01,136
I get it. What you're saying is that
oppositely-charged particles collide,

359
00:32:01,304 --> 00:32:06,183
and blow each other up in a burst of energy.
Like a tiny big bang, like a... baby bang.

360
00:32:08,561 --> 00:32:12,272
I'm probably just stating the very obvious.
Shut up, Penny. Shut up.

361
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:16,443
Oh, no. It's not obvious at all. If it was obvious,
everybody would be doing it every day.

362
00:32:16,569 --> 00:32:21,031
See, by all accounts, it appears as though
I literally went right through a mountain.

363
00:32:21,199 --> 00:32:25,160
But you could take that mountain
and pulverize it...

364
00:32:25,286 --> 00:32:30,290
and sift through it like breadcrumbs
for the rest of your natural life...

365
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:35,796
and you would never ever find... this.

366
00:32:37,006 --> 00:32:42,010
And yet this living organism came out
of that mountain in Texas with me.

367
00:32:42,136 --> 00:32:46,006
Even though I was never
inside that mountain.

368
00:32:46,724 --> 00:32:48,124
The president's calling.

369
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:51,467
- The president of what?
- The president of the United States.

370
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,800
Oh. Here.

371
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,250
Later.

372
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,460
Is he still delirious?

373
00:32:56,471 --> 00:32:59,671
I can't tell. It's real fuzzy. I patched
him through to a payphone down the hall.

374
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:03,865
- Do your thing.
- Buckaroo, you forgot your thruster.

375
00:33:04,033 --> 00:33:06,910
Why don't you hold onto it for a while?

376
00:33:07,036 --> 00:33:08,870
Any time.

377
00:33:08,996 --> 00:33:11,540
Do we have the first slide, please?

378
00:33:11,666 --> 00:33:15,085
What about the Pentagon?
The possibility of war

379
00:33:15,211 --> 00:33:17,712
in the Eighth Dimension, Mr. Secretary?

380
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:18,839
What?

381
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:23,677
It seemed like a strange connection
even back at the bus.

382
00:33:26,222 --> 00:33:28,181
Mr. President?

383
00:33:30,017 --> 00:33:32,394
Some kind of interference.

384
00:33:34,188 --> 00:33:36,231
Hello, Mr. President?

385
00:33:36,357 --> 00:33:39,526
Mr. President? Mr. President, hello?

386
00:33:40,236 --> 00:33:41,820
Hello, Mr. President?

387
00:33:42,363 --> 00:33:45,407
- What's going on?
- Maybe it's a prankster, some computer whiz kid.

388
00:33:45,533 --> 00:33:47,576
Not with Elephant Bravo.

389
00:33:47,702 --> 00:33:51,997
- Not with an alpha clearance.
- Alpha clearance? Hello? Mr...

390
00:33:52,123 --> 00:33:56,418
Ed, go back to the bus and reroute this call to
the president's suite at Walter Reed Hospital.

391
00:33:56,544 --> 00:34:01,381
Yeah, and make sure this is on the level.
We're busy people here.

392
00:34:01,507 --> 00:34:03,592
Does the President call him a lot?

393
00:34:08,347 --> 00:34:10,265
Pencil! Pen! Quick! Anything!

394
00:34:10,433 --> 00:34:12,184
Don't touch him!

395
00:34:14,145 --> 00:34:16,813
What's he writing?

396
00:34:16,939 --> 00:34:18,356
Conference room!

397
00:34:18,482 --> 00:34:20,483
Conference room! Let's go!

398
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,986
Launch thermopod.

399
00:34:34,916 --> 00:34:37,167
- There they are.
- Dr. Banzai.

400
00:34:37,335 --> 00:34:39,920
- Don't you see 'em?
- What do you mean? Who?

401
00:34:40,046 --> 00:34:44,466
Evil! Pure and simple from the
Eighth Dimension! Grab 'em!

402
00:34:44,926 --> 00:34:48,511
- Lectroids! Grab 'em!
- Lectroids? He's got a gun.

403
00:34:49,138 --> 00:34:52,057
OK, wise guy!

404
00:34:54,894 --> 00:34:59,689
Let those gun belts hit the floor!
Nobody follows or the Prof is history!

405
00:35:01,817 --> 00:35:04,861
- Where's Buckaroo?
- Get him.

406
00:35:04,987 --> 00:35:09,115
- Where's the overthruster?
- Get an ambulance.

407
00:35:24,966 --> 00:35:29,427
- Come on, will you just ignore them?
- Isn't that...?

408
00:35:53,202 --> 00:35:55,620
Hey, wait a minute! You can't ride that!

409
00:35:57,248 --> 00:35:59,332
It's Buckaroo Banzai!

410
00:36:12,096 --> 00:36:13,138
- Hold it!
- Freeze!

411
00:36:35,077 --> 00:36:39,289
- I had my eyes open all day long, Burt.
- It may not be a total loss.

412
00:36:39,415 --> 00:36:43,793
- I'm about ready to go home.
- We might see something.

413
00:36:48,466 --> 00:36:51,551
I hit it! It is wounded.

414
00:36:53,429 --> 00:36:55,847
What'd it look like to you?

415
00:36:55,973 --> 00:36:59,142
- Like a big black flying dinosaur.
- Dinosaur? It was purple.

416
00:36:59,268 --> 00:37:04,064
- That's what it looked like. It was black.
- It was purple. It'll be dark before we even find it.

417
00:37:05,191 --> 00:37:08,443
We get Professor Hikita
to cough up the crucial missing circuit

418
00:37:08,611 --> 00:37:10,862
and then we finally get our butts off this rock!

419
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:13,907
Oh, yeah? Listen to this!

420
00:37:14,825 --> 00:37:18,328
Well, what is it? What is it?

421
00:37:18,454 --> 00:37:20,372
Black thermopod emergency beacon!

422
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:23,208
Here? On Earth?

423
00:37:23,334 --> 00:37:27,337
- Why? John Bigbooté, why?
- Coordinates established.

424
00:37:27,463 --> 00:37:30,465
Electromagnetic energy
back on route three.

425
00:37:49,068 --> 00:37:52,153
- The whole top of the tree's squashed!
- Do you think it up there?

426
00:37:52,321 --> 00:37:54,239
Let's wait for the cops, Burt.

427
00:37:54,365 --> 00:37:57,283
What for? Are you scared?

428
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:00,578
- There's gotta be something there.
- Come on, Burt. There's nothing up there.

429
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:04,124
Well, how do you know?
Here, hold this. Hold this!

430
00:38:06,502 --> 00:38:09,754
Where you going? Where you going?!

431
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,923
Christmas shopping.

432
00:38:14,051 --> 00:38:17,595
- What's that?
- It's a stick. What's it look like?

433
00:38:19,098 --> 00:38:21,433
- Gimme some light, will ya?
- I got two guns in my hands.

434
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:24,477
- Put one of them down.
- I ain't putting the guns down!

435
00:38:24,603 --> 00:38:27,939
- It's just a tree.
- Then leave it alone!

436
00:38:28,107 --> 00:38:31,651
Aagh! See, I told you!
I told you! Leave it alone!

437
00:38:34,738 --> 00:38:37,657
Run! Run! Run!

438
00:38:37,783 --> 00:38:42,996
- Shoot it, Bubba. Shoot it!
- I can't! It's jammed! It's jammed!

439
00:38:47,251 --> 00:38:50,837
There's something.
There's something coming out!

440
00:38:50,963 --> 00:38:52,881
- Where?
- Out of the top.

441
00:38:57,553 --> 00:38:59,262
Oh, my soul!

442
00:39:01,056 --> 00:39:05,643
Throw me my gun, Bubba. Throw it.

443
00:39:08,314 --> 00:39:09,522
Sorry.

444
00:39:22,828 --> 00:39:23,870
Is he dead?

445
00:39:23,996 --> 00:39:26,998
Yeah, I think so. But look
at his face. It's changing.

446
00:39:27,124 --> 00:39:30,418
And his hair...
his hair is all disappeared.

447
00:39:30,628 --> 00:39:35,673
- What's that smell? You smell electricity?
- He's crackling. We're standing in water.

448
00:39:35,799 --> 00:39:37,166
What is he, Burt?
Is he radioactive?

449
00:39:37,176 --> 00:39:41,095
How the hell do I know?
Do I look like a nuclear genius?

450
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,389
He's probably from Mars.
Or Jupiter.

451
00:39:43,516 --> 00:39:45,892
Jupiter? I hope he's alone.

452
00:39:46,018 --> 00:39:48,144
- There's somethin' over there.
- Where?

453
00:39:48,312 --> 00:39:50,355
Right there.

454
00:39:57,738 --> 00:39:59,781
What is it?

455
00:40:02,701 --> 00:40:06,788
Buckaroo Banzai. It's the latest issue.

456
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:12,961
Rawhide, come in. Rawhide.

457
00:40:13,546 --> 00:40:14,796
Rawhide.

458
00:40:14,922 --> 00:40:19,175
Buckaroo, what's up? Where in Hades
are you? I'm gettin' a lot of static.

459
00:40:19,343 --> 00:40:22,762
Yeah. That's me.

460
00:40:22,888 --> 00:40:27,600
I've been ionized, but I'm OK now.

461
00:40:27,726 --> 00:40:31,437
Listen, I'm switching
on the homing beacon.

462
00:40:31,564 --> 00:40:35,233
Mark two minute intervals... now.

463
00:40:35,401 --> 00:40:39,988
Look, we got the overthruster. But someone
shanghaied the Professor right from the conference.

464
00:40:40,072 --> 00:40:44,826
- Oh, the deuce you say.
- What do you think?

465
00:40:44,952 --> 00:40:48,329
- Dr. Lizardo, maybe?
- Yeah, I'd put money on it.

466
00:40:48,455 --> 00:40:51,124
- That crate.
- What crate?

467
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:54,168
The crate they shoved in that van.

468
00:40:54,295 --> 00:40:55,837
You and the guys...

469
00:40:55,963 --> 00:40:59,716
go back to the house and dig up
everything you can on an outfit called

470
00:40:59,842 --> 00:41:02,260
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems.

471
00:41:02,386 --> 00:41:05,680
- You got that?
- Right. Yoyodyne. We're on it.

472
00:41:08,767 --> 00:41:12,186
Hand me that tarp, will ya?
Let's cover this guy up.

473
00:41:12,313 --> 00:41:15,356
- Guy? What guy?
- He's got paws.

474
00:41:17,818 --> 00:41:19,986
- Now what?
- Who are they?

475
00:41:21,989 --> 00:41:24,032
Cover it up.

476
00:41:30,998 --> 00:41:32,832
John Bigbooté, Officer.

477
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:35,668
Head of Operations,
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems.

478
00:41:35,794 --> 00:41:39,922
- There's one of our birds.
- That fella over there one of your birds, too?

479
00:41:40,049 --> 00:41:42,133
The droid, you mean?

480
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:47,889
Doesn't look like anything I've seen
before. I mean, I've seen droids...

481
00:41:48,807 --> 00:41:50,224
Nice night, huh?

482
00:42:04,073 --> 00:42:06,866
That big thing over there attacked me.

483
00:42:07,034 --> 00:42:09,952
Impossible. No, no, no, no, no, no.

484
00:42:10,037 --> 00:42:13,748
Yeah! It's some kinda creature.
There's part of it still stuck in the tree.

485
00:42:13,874 --> 00:42:18,086
No, it's a machine with 30-foot
leather wings. I think it's radioactive.

486
00:42:18,962 --> 00:42:22,757
Three minutes since he last moved.
This is a fix. Something is happening.

487
00:42:22,883 --> 00:42:24,759
Let's get somebody over there.

488
00:42:24,885 --> 00:42:28,137
AI, you set up the grid
and get the last known coordinates.

489
00:42:28,305 --> 00:42:31,265
Tommy, hop on the Marconi
and see if we got Blue Blazes

490
00:42:31,392 --> 00:42:34,477
in a ten-minute radius.
But no strike teams, Tommy, understand?

491
00:42:34,603 --> 00:42:37,313
I'm headed downstairs.
Keep everybody calm.

492
00:42:41,652 --> 00:42:44,779
- Hikita-san.
- Buckaroo!

493
00:42:45,906 --> 00:42:49,701
Repeating: Intrastate outward band five.

494
00:42:49,827 --> 00:42:53,246
Coded. Calling all Blue Blaze
irregulars in the Garden State.

495
00:42:54,081 --> 00:42:58,167
Buckaroo... in trouble.
Will repeat coordinates.

496
00:42:58,293 --> 00:43:03,589
This is Scooter Lindley, Junior Blue Blaze
irregular 41 and a half. Hang on.

497
00:43:04,925 --> 00:43:08,428
- Dad! Dad! Buckaroo's in trouble!
- Say what?

498
00:43:08,595 --> 00:43:12,181
Aliens from the Eighth Dimension.
I'm seeing them now.

499
00:43:12,266 --> 00:43:14,100
You can see them now? Here?

500
00:43:14,268 --> 00:43:18,020
Yeah, the three jerks driving this van.
Look at this. What is this?

501
00:43:19,773 --> 00:43:21,649
It's your hand, Buckaroo.

502
00:43:21,775 --> 00:43:25,319
No, no, no, no, it's a formula.
It's an antidote of some kind.

503
00:43:25,446 --> 00:43:28,846
Whatever that was in that phoney call
from the president gave me information,

504
00:43:28,991 --> 00:43:32,991
some electrochemical message that
allows me to see what they really are.

505
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,450
What are they?

506
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,800
Lectroids from Planet Ten by
way of the Eighth Dimension.

507
00:43:38,292 --> 00:43:40,168
Mr. Gomez?

508
00:43:40,294 --> 00:43:42,934
- I got a truck on the way to help mop things up.
- Identification?

509
00:43:43,046 --> 00:43:47,800
Or else this place'll become a zoo,
not to mention a haven for gawkers.

510
00:43:47,885 --> 00:43:50,136
Wait a minute. Now just a second.

511
00:43:50,304 --> 00:43:53,139
- Stay put. All of ya.
- Sure thing.

512
00:43:54,266 --> 00:43:56,642
We'll go ahead and start breaking it down.

513
00:43:56,769 --> 00:43:59,020
Don't touch it!

514
00:43:59,146 --> 00:44:02,565
I got my own help on the way.
Now, that's an order.

515
00:44:06,612 --> 00:44:08,738
Go find something to crack it open.

516
00:44:08,906 --> 00:44:10,656
There's a Harley in those bushes.

517
00:44:10,741 --> 00:44:14,368
I want you to get out and go to the laboratory,
start working on this formula.

518
00:44:14,495 --> 00:44:19,040
- I want you to synthesize it.
- Buckaroo! Give me the formula.

519
00:44:34,473 --> 00:44:35,223
Oh, wow!

520
00:44:37,026 --> 00:44:37,726
Peggy!

521
00:44:37,768 --> 00:44:41,938
She's not Peggy, Mrs. Johnson.
Sois sage, mon amie.

522
00:44:42,064 --> 00:44:45,650
No. Of course not. How could she be?

523
00:44:45,776 --> 00:44:48,736
- Any word from Buckaroo?
- No, I thought he was with you guys.

524
00:44:48,862 --> 00:44:53,115
No, he's not. Ah, Dr. Zwibel,
Penny Priddy... Mrs. Johnson.

525
00:44:53,283 --> 00:44:57,161
Nice to meet you.
The fellas call me New Jersey.

526
00:45:02,668 --> 00:45:06,504
- Well, where are they all going?
- Bunk house. Off limits.

527
00:45:10,217 --> 00:45:12,301
Again, John Gomez!

528
00:45:15,973 --> 00:45:18,432
John O'Connor,
there's a crowbar in the truck.

529
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:20,601
I'll get it.

530
00:45:34,783 --> 00:45:37,994
Destroy yourself, John Gant.

531
00:45:38,829 --> 00:45:40,872
Set detonator.

532
00:45:45,002 --> 00:45:47,503
Detonator set.

533
00:45:48,463 --> 00:45:53,259
My most profuse apologies
to my homeland and loved ones.

534
00:45:53,427 --> 00:45:57,263
John Valuk is dead. He fell on his head.

535
00:45:58,473 --> 00:46:02,476
Perhaps John Parker will get through
with our message to Buckaroo Banzai.

536
00:46:02,603 --> 00:46:05,187
I said back off! Now, dammit, I mean it!

537
00:46:05,355 --> 00:46:08,524
Hey! Hey, leave him alone! Ugh!

538
00:46:09,484 --> 00:46:14,071
Easy, friend. Ha, Buckaroo Banzai!

539
00:46:17,034 --> 00:46:18,117
Hey!

540
00:46:18,744 --> 00:46:21,704
It's Buckaroo Banzai! Get him!

541
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:34,050
Hustle up!

542
00:47:01,036 --> 00:47:06,040
Scooter Lindley, Blue Blaze Irregular.

543
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:22,223
- It is! It is Professor Hikita.
- We're closing the gate. Please, step back!

544
00:47:22,349 --> 00:47:25,601
Where's Buckaroo?

545
00:47:38,156 --> 00:47:41,909
We gotta have something for him.
Try a new cipher.

546
00:47:46,415 --> 00:47:48,874
- Try a G-cipher.
- G-cipher.

547
00:47:50,794 --> 00:47:52,878
There...

548
00:47:53,088 --> 00:47:54,046
That's more like it.

549
00:47:54,715 --> 00:47:59,343
Looks like we've accessed their restricted
data file. Could be highly revealing.

550
00:47:59,469 --> 00:48:03,556
No sign of Buckaroo. The Professor
just rode up saying something

551
00:48:03,724 --> 00:48:07,810
about space monsters and where's the
overthruster. Went straight to the lab.

552
00:48:07,936 --> 00:48:09,729
Space monsters, my ass.

553
00:48:12,899 --> 00:48:15,609
Hey, man, nice jacket.

554
00:48:22,909 --> 00:48:25,786
What's in the big pink box?

555
00:48:29,708 --> 00:48:33,294
Hey, buddy. May I help you?

556
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,546
Hello! Buckaroo Banzai!?

557
00:48:35,672 --> 00:48:38,132
You a messenger? What you got here?

558
00:48:38,258 --> 00:48:42,344
No, no, wait a minute.
I need see Buckaroo Banzai in person.

559
00:48:42,763 --> 00:48:46,140
My name is John Parker.

560
00:48:46,266 --> 00:48:47,892
Identify yourself, no?

561
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:51,353
Blue Blaze irregular Pinky Carruthers.

562
00:48:51,438 --> 00:48:55,900
Sorry, John, everybody
needs see Buckaroo. Later.

563
00:48:56,526 --> 00:48:58,861
Gino, run this down to the Professor for me.

564
00:48:58,987 --> 00:49:00,667
Sounds like he's getting a little nervous.

565
00:49:02,657 --> 00:49:05,242
- This is queer. Look.
- What's up? What you got?

566
00:49:05,368 --> 00:49:10,414
All these people applied for social security cards
in the same town in New Jersey on exact same date.

567
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:11,791
New Jersey?

568
00:49:12,501 --> 00:49:16,170
46 Yoyodyne employees,
Grover's Mill, New Jersey,

569
00:49:16,338 --> 00:49:18,714
11 -1 -38.

570
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,424
I got some pictures, boys.

571
00:49:22,344 --> 00:49:26,388
It looks like a practical joke.
Check out these names:

572
00:49:26,515 --> 00:49:31,268
John Yaya? John Parrot?
John Bigbooty?

573
00:49:31,436 --> 00:49:35,064
Maybe not.
John Nolan? John O'Connor?

574
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:37,316
No way, José.

575
00:49:37,484 --> 00:49:43,155
John Small Berries? It's a joke. Maybe
that's what Buckaroo was talking about.

576
00:49:43,281 --> 00:49:46,617
No, Reno, there are no ages
and no places of birth.

577
00:49:46,743 --> 00:49:51,163
Uh, Grover's Mill. Grover's Mill, 1938.
Why's that so familiar?

578
00:49:51,832 --> 00:49:56,252
They all have the same first name.
John, John, John, John, John.

579
00:49:56,378 --> 00:50:00,047
Somebody's playing games.
This is statistically impossible.

580
00:50:00,173 --> 00:50:02,299
No, no, no. Wait a minute,
wait a minute, um...

581
00:50:02,425 --> 00:50:04,385
November one. October.

582
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:07,429
30 days have September, April,
June, November. Short February.

583
00:50:07,556 --> 00:50:11,100
And all the rest have 31 . October 31st.

584
00:50:11,226 --> 00:50:13,519
Halloween.

585
00:50:13,645 --> 00:50:15,521
Oh, um...

586
00:50:15,647 --> 00:50:18,065
Don't you get it? Orson Welles.

587
00:50:18,191 --> 00:50:20,901
You mean the guy from
the old wine commercials?

588
00:50:21,027 --> 00:50:25,156
Halloween, 1938. War of the Worlds,
that fake radio news broadcast

589
00:50:25,282 --> 00:50:28,742
that got everybody scared,
thinking real, live Martians...

590
00:50:29,703 --> 00:50:32,580
were landing in Grover's Mill...

591
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:36,000
New Jersey.

592
00:50:36,126 --> 00:50:38,544
Then it all just turned out to be a hoax.

593
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:39,670
So?

594
00:50:40,505 --> 00:50:46,260
So... maybe it wasn't a hoax.
Or, I mean, maybe it isn't a hoax.

595
00:50:54,811 --> 00:50:58,063
If we don't find the overthruster,
Whorfin'll have us for supper.

596
00:50:58,190 --> 00:51:01,692
Who says the damn
thing's even here?

597
00:51:20,962 --> 00:51:23,005
Come on! Come on!

598
00:51:40,982 --> 00:51:43,776
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

599
00:52:09,511 --> 00:52:12,513
All right, who's the wise guy?

600
00:52:15,475 --> 00:52:18,060
I said, who's the wise guy?

601
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:33,200
It's locked.

602
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,500
John O'Connor, smash the window.

603
00:52:41,668 --> 00:52:44,586
Why me, John Bigbooté?

604
00:52:48,717 --> 00:52:51,135
It might be booby-trapped.

605
00:52:51,261 --> 00:52:53,012
Oh.

606
00:52:59,561 --> 00:53:01,845
- Buckaroo!
- Mrs. Johnson, this is Casper and Scooter Lindley.

607
00:53:01,855 --> 00:53:04,097
Is Hikita-san here yet? Where's
the overthruster? Where's Penny?

608
00:53:04,107 --> 00:53:08,527
Prof is in the lab with the overthruster. Penny's in
the right wing guest room. Everybody's safe and sound.

609
00:53:08,611 --> 00:53:10,654
- They're lectroids, Buckaroo.
- From Planet Ten.

610
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:14,074
- Planet Ten? How do you guys know?
- It's all on the yellow record. Come on.

611
00:53:14,242 --> 00:53:15,659
- Casper Lindley.
- Reno.

612
00:53:15,744 --> 00:53:19,872
- Yellow record?
- However, they didn't come here on a nonstop flight.

613
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:23,792
They blasted through the Eighth
Dimension in 1938 over in Grover's Mill.

614
00:53:23,918 --> 00:53:27,004
Where there was a huge
electrical dimensional accident.

615
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:31,091
Some giant explosion. And they hypnotized
Orson Welles into covering it up.

616
00:53:31,259 --> 00:53:34,470
So, first he says there's
an invasion from Mars,

617
00:53:34,596 --> 00:53:37,681
but then he says, no, no, no,
it's just a radio-show hoax.

618
00:53:37,807 --> 00:53:39,057
- Get it?
- No.

619
00:53:39,225 --> 00:53:40,525
- Let's go.
- Orson Welles?

620
00:53:40,526 --> 00:53:42,526
What about Yoyodyne?
What about Dr. Lizardo?

621
00:53:42,604 --> 00:53:46,148
- That's what we're trying to tell you.
- There's someone living inside him.

622
00:53:47,275 --> 00:53:48,609
- Buckaroo.
- Pinky.

623
00:53:48,777 --> 00:53:54,865
Put this on. Here, y'all put these on.
There's more in the box and there's one over there.

624
00:53:54,949 --> 00:53:58,327
- What's this?
- It came with the record. It's like a 3-D type thing.

625
00:53:58,453 --> 00:54:00,871
How am I supposed to know
he's from outer space?

626
00:54:00,997 --> 00:54:04,625
This Rasta guy pedals up to the front gate
and delivers it all in a pink cake box.

627
00:54:04,793 --> 00:54:07,211
- What? What for?
- We don't know. It wouldn't tell us.

628
00:54:07,295 --> 00:54:11,131
- It wants to talk to the head honcho.
- Lights.

629
00:54:23,686 --> 00:54:25,979
Salutations, great Buckaroo Banzai.

630
00:54:27,273 --> 00:54:31,527
I am John Emdall from Planet Ten.

631
00:54:31,653 --> 00:54:35,739
A common, grave danger
confronts both our worlds.

632
00:54:36,324 --> 00:54:39,243
- After a bloody reign of terror...
- Hey, what is that?

633
00:54:39,369 --> 00:54:42,663
...the hated leader of a military caste...

634
00:54:42,831 --> 00:54:46,667
the self-proclaimed "Lord" John Whorfin,

635
00:54:46,751 --> 00:54:49,670
a bloodthirsty butcher
as evil as your Hitler...

636
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:50,838
Oh, wow!

637
00:54:50,964 --> 00:54:54,550
...was overthrown
by freedom-loving forces...

638
00:54:54,676 --> 00:54:59,346
tried and condemned, along with
several hundred of his followers,

639
00:54:59,514 --> 00:55:05,060
to spend eternity in the formless void
of the Eighth Dimension.

640
00:55:05,186 --> 00:55:07,980
Did you tell Penny that
Buckaroo's looking for her?

641
00:55:08,064 --> 00:55:09,472
I looked in her room.
She wasn't there.

642
00:55:09,482 --> 00:55:11,108
- Who's Penny?
- Where is she?

643
00:55:11,234 --> 00:55:14,486
Will everybody shut up
so I can hear the rest of this thing?

644
00:55:14,612 --> 00:55:20,325
And now you, Buckaroo Banzai, have
unintentionally helped John Whorfin

645
00:55:20,827 --> 00:55:23,912
with the success of your
oscillation overthruster.

646
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:30,294
For our intelligence warns us that
he intends to steal your overthruster.

647
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:35,466
If he should attempt this,
we will have no choice

648
00:55:35,592 --> 00:55:39,344
but to disrupt worldwide
electronic communications

649
00:55:39,471 --> 00:55:44,057
and fire a particle-beam weapon
from your airspace

650
00:55:44,184 --> 00:55:48,770
to Smolensk in the Union
of Soviet Socialist Republics.

651
00:55:48,855 --> 00:55:52,535
That an action that the Kremlin will most certainly
misinterpret as an American first strike.

652
00:55:52,609 --> 00:55:59,698
- They're already a little trigger-happy.
- Stop John Whorfin before sunset.

653
00:55:59,824 --> 00:56:04,828
If you fail, we will be forced
to help you destroy yourselves.

654
00:56:04,954 --> 00:56:07,873
- If it ain't one thing, it's another.
- Lighten up.

655
00:56:07,999 --> 00:56:10,792
End of discussion.

656
00:56:12,045 --> 00:56:14,755
Discussion? What discussion?

657
00:56:17,634 --> 00:56:21,970
She gotta be kidding, right?
Vaporize the whole damn planet?

658
00:56:22,096 --> 00:56:27,518
- You wanna roll those dice, Casper?
- No, no, no, not me, man. No way.

659
00:56:27,644 --> 00:56:31,146
Gents... we're going to Yoyodyne.

660
00:56:31,272 --> 00:56:33,857
Rawhide, see how Hikita-san is
with that formula.

661
00:56:34,025 --> 00:56:36,610
Billy, tell Sam to prep
the jet car for city driving.

662
00:56:36,736 --> 00:56:39,029
What about a Blue Blaze strike team?

663
00:56:39,155 --> 00:56:42,908
We keep it intimate. Call the Kolodny
Brothers. Call the Rug Suckers.

664
00:56:43,076 --> 00:56:46,161
- Where are you going?
- Get my guns.

665
00:56:47,747 --> 00:56:49,581
His guns?

666
00:56:49,958 --> 00:56:53,377
Okay, okay, I'm a girl. I don't deny it.
I sneaked into your bedroom.

667
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:56,421
I invaded your privacy.
I went through your personal belongings.

668
00:56:56,548 --> 00:57:00,926
- Mrs. Johnson! I can never find anything around here...
- I took a bath!

669
00:57:01,052 --> 00:57:05,097
- Penny, what's your problem?
- Me! You! That picture!

670
00:57:05,223 --> 00:57:09,810
I'm going crazy. Who's that girl, Buckaroo?
What's going on around here?

671
00:57:09,936 --> 00:57:12,271
You drag me out of jail.
You're like Jerry Lewis.

672
00:57:12,397 --> 00:57:15,232
You give me hope to carry on, but then
you leave me in the lurch

673
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:19,444
while you strap on your six-guns.
What do you want from me?

674
00:57:19,571 --> 00:57:21,905
- Who am I?
- As near as I can figure...

675
00:57:22,407 --> 00:57:25,993
you had an identical twin sister and...

676
00:57:26,119 --> 00:57:28,161
I married her.

677
00:57:29,163 --> 00:57:30,956
But that's over now.

678
00:57:31,124 --> 00:57:36,253
And she's gone and that's about all
there is, really, to say about that.

679
00:57:47,223 --> 00:57:52,769
We don't know what to expect here.
It disagrees with all the standard pictures.

680
00:57:53,646 --> 00:57:56,982
It's producing a magnetic force.

681
00:57:57,108 --> 00:57:59,526
No, no. I'm wrong!

682
00:58:10,913 --> 00:58:12,831
Hey!

683
00:58:16,419 --> 00:58:18,670
Oh, tell me I'm dreaming.

684
00:58:19,631 --> 00:58:21,757
- Ow!
- Oh, sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's...

685
00:58:21,924 --> 00:58:25,344
- Buckaroo! Sorry. Sam's dead.
- Sam?

686
00:58:25,511 --> 00:58:27,962
Someone broke into the jet-car.
Things are going haywire over at the lab.

687
00:58:27,972 --> 00:58:30,015
Wait here. I'll be right back.

688
00:58:41,402 --> 00:58:42,444
Oh, boy.

689
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:56,166
He's dead. Spread out.
They can't be very far off.

690
00:58:57,919 --> 00:59:01,672
Okay. Tommy, check the biomedical labs.
Reno, take physics. Jersey, go with Reno.

691
00:59:01,798 --> 00:59:04,007
- Where you going?
- Engineering.

692
00:59:05,468 --> 00:59:08,136
Cowboy! Hold your gun
in front of you, man.

693
00:59:08,262 --> 00:59:10,889
- Oh, I see. I got that. OK.
- It's cool.

694
00:59:23,361 --> 00:59:24,945
Buckaroo, behind you!

695
00:59:34,622 --> 00:59:38,208
- You... you OK?
- Yeah. Just let me catch my breath.

696
00:59:38,334 --> 00:59:42,170
Professor went down into the purification
vent. He's got the overthruster.

697
00:59:42,296 --> 00:59:44,339
All right.

698
00:59:54,475 --> 00:59:57,018
Why is there a watermelon there?

699
00:59:58,479 --> 01:00:00,564
I'll tell you later.

700
01:00:33,014 --> 01:00:34,848
Buckaroo?

701
01:00:38,728 --> 01:00:40,479
Rawhide?

702
01:00:41,647 --> 01:00:43,231
Anybody?

703
01:01:09,926 --> 01:01:13,762
Here, young lady. The overthruster.

704
01:01:18,184 --> 01:01:20,435
Here, put this in your purse.

705
01:01:22,271 --> 01:01:24,314
Get out of here!

706
01:01:26,943 --> 01:01:29,110
Where's your overthruster?

707
01:01:29,278 --> 01:01:31,321
Hikita-san!

708
01:01:36,702 --> 01:01:39,162
Nice morning, huh?

709
01:01:53,135 --> 01:01:55,762
It's just making my legs asleep.

710
01:01:55,888 --> 01:01:59,641
- What the hell is wrong with him?
- I don't know. I don't know. Are you cold?

711
01:02:00,268 --> 01:02:01,685
It's my spine.

712
01:02:08,776 --> 01:02:13,029
- What're you still doing on this floor?
- I think it's cos I can't move my legs.

713
01:02:13,614 --> 01:02:15,866
Ooh, damn!

714
01:02:17,743 --> 01:02:20,370
- What is it? Apache?
- Arachtoid.

715
01:02:20,496 --> 01:02:23,290
Oh, spiders. So I was right, huh?

716
01:02:23,457 --> 01:02:26,877
We got the guy, Rawhide.
Sucker only tried...

717
01:02:27,628 --> 01:02:30,797
- Any antidote for these things?
- No. Not at all.

718
01:02:32,174 --> 01:02:35,844
- Come over here.
- Does that mean you're on our side?

719
01:02:36,012 --> 01:02:37,637
That's right.

720
01:02:40,683 --> 01:02:45,604
Man! Those things
pack a mean wallop, huh?

721
01:02:46,188 --> 01:02:48,648
What are y'all looking at?

722
01:02:49,692 --> 01:02:53,612
You're on the clock. Let's saddle up, huh?

723
01:03:01,495 --> 01:03:04,039
Hey, man, they're stealing my helicopter!

724
01:03:07,752 --> 01:03:09,836
They've got Penny!

725
01:03:09,962 --> 01:03:12,881
She has the overthruster.

726
01:03:12,965 --> 01:03:16,009
We'll get it back. We'll get it back.

727
01:03:16,594 --> 01:03:23,099
It's... it's not Buckaroo Banzai per se,
Mr. President. It's his men.

728
01:03:23,225 --> 01:03:26,811
Foreigners, some of 'em.
Or their names have been changed.

729
01:03:26,938 --> 01:03:30,732
Their true backgrounds
are shrouded in secrecy!

730
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:36,237
Now, all I'm saying is that this jet car
belongs in the hands of Defense.

731
01:03:36,322 --> 01:03:40,742
I mean, if the Banzai Institute
doesn't want to sell it to us,

732
01:03:40,826 --> 01:03:43,119
then we're gonna have
to take it from them!

733
01:03:43,287 --> 01:03:46,373
In national interest, of course.

734
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:49,834
Come in.

735
01:03:49,961 --> 01:03:55,131
Excuse me, Mr. President, World Watch One.
Direct-incoming transmission.

736
01:03:55,299 --> 01:03:56,716
Yeah.

737
01:04:02,682 --> 01:04:05,141
Hello, Mr. President, I know your back is killing you,

738
01:04:05,309 --> 01:04:09,396
but I have a developing situation here
and I must speak frankly.

739
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:13,066
Buckaroo...
Secretary of Defense McKinley

740
01:04:13,192 --> 01:04:16,820
and my National Security Advisor
Smirnoff, are visiting me,

741
01:04:16,988 --> 01:04:19,406
but I have no secrets from them.

742
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:22,951
Well, something has reared
its ugly head in outer space, Mr. President,

743
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:25,787
and it looks like the Earth is caught in a crossfire.

744
01:04:25,871 --> 01:04:28,790
We have reason to believe
that there are vicious red aliens

745
01:04:28,958 --> 01:04:32,502
walking freely among us,
posing as the owners and operators

746
01:04:32,628 --> 01:04:34,671
of Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems.

747
01:04:34,797 --> 01:04:40,552
Yoyodyne Propulsion... the people
working on our Truncheon Bomber?

748
01:04:40,636 --> 01:04:45,223
- In the hands of foreign nationals?
- Excuse me, Mr. President. Time is short.

749
01:04:46,183 --> 01:04:49,102
In order to prevent
John Whorfin's escape,

750
01:04:49,228 --> 01:04:52,981
my comrades are at this very moment
taking up a geostationary position

751
01:04:53,149 --> 01:04:56,401
over New Jersey.
This situation is explosive.

752
01:04:56,485 --> 01:04:58,945
- Who the hell is that?
- Explosive, what are you saying man?

753
01:04:59,071 --> 01:05:00,989
Some kind of race war in New Jersey?

754
01:05:01,073 --> 01:05:02,490
No, Mr. President, no.

755
01:05:02,575 --> 01:05:06,453
This man as you call him is not
a human being at all, but is, in fact,

756
01:05:06,579 --> 01:05:10,707
a black lectroid named John Parker
from the very same Planet Ten.

757
01:05:10,833 --> 01:05:14,586
And his spaceship is, at this moment,
anchored above Yoyodyne.

758
01:05:14,754 --> 01:05:15,712
Yoyodyne.

759
01:05:15,838 --> 01:05:18,757
- Buckaroo, my good friend...
- That's it!

760
01:05:18,924 --> 01:05:22,761
These red creatures, they must
somehow give off the bacteria.

761
01:05:22,887 --> 01:05:27,891
We breathe it. It swims up our nose
into our cerebral cortex

762
01:05:28,017 --> 01:05:31,436
where it talks to our brain cells.

763
01:05:31,604 --> 01:05:34,689
Tells us to see exactly
what they want us to see.

764
01:05:34,815 --> 01:05:36,274
Electric brainwashing.

765
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,026
Diabolical. They got us so confused...

766
01:05:38,152 --> 01:05:41,237
Buckaroo, I don't know what to say.

767
01:05:42,573 --> 01:05:45,784
Lectroids from Planet Ten?

768
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:48,828
Nuclear extortion?

769
01:05:48,996 --> 01:05:51,289
A girl named John?

770
01:05:51,415 --> 01:05:53,166
Buckaroo, Lectroid Wing Commander.

771
01:05:53,292 --> 01:05:57,045
Excuse me, Mr. President,
I have to go talk to the hornet's nest.

772
01:05:58,339 --> 01:06:00,298
Good God.

773
01:06:00,424 --> 01:06:04,969
Well, if it wasn't Buckaroo Banzai,
I'd say commit the man.

774
01:06:05,096 --> 01:06:06,679
Get me SAC Headquarters, Omaha,

775
01:06:06,847 --> 01:06:10,767
NORAD and the Strategic Space Command.
I want some hard data on that cloud.

776
01:06:10,935 --> 01:06:14,187
John, get out in the field.
Stick your beak into this one.

777
01:06:15,606 --> 01:06:19,317
- What is this thing made of?
- Cobalt and electricity.

778
01:06:19,443 --> 01:06:23,988
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.

779
01:06:24,115 --> 01:06:26,241
World Watch One.

780
01:06:28,953 --> 01:06:30,912
Buckaroo.

781
01:06:31,122 --> 01:06:33,164
It's Whorfin.

782
01:06:36,210 --> 01:06:37,710
Dr. Banzai?

783
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:43,007
Yes, this is Emilio Lizardo.

784
01:06:43,134 --> 01:06:45,385
Maybe you don't remember me.

785
01:06:46,387 --> 01:06:50,223
Ah. I'm flattered.
We know the same people.

786
01:06:51,350 --> 01:06:54,060
Yeah. In fact, one of them
is with me right now.

787
01:06:54,186 --> 01:06:56,229
Your associate...

788
01:06:56,355 --> 01:06:58,815
Dr. Penny Priddy.

789
01:06:58,941 --> 01:07:00,275
Doctor?

790
01:07:00,401 --> 01:07:03,027
May I pass along my congratulations

791
01:07:03,154 --> 01:07:06,990
for your great
interdimensional breakthrough.

792
01:07:07,116 --> 01:07:12,203
I'm sure in the miserable annals of
the Earth, you will be duly enshrined.

793
01:07:14,081 --> 01:07:18,042
However... Miss Priddy claims

794
01:07:18,169 --> 01:07:21,004
to be unable to solve my problem

795
01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:24,340
and provide me with
the crucial missing circuit

796
01:07:24,508 --> 01:07:26,092
for my overthruster!

797
01:07:26,719 --> 01:07:28,761
He hasn't found it. He hasn't found it.

798
01:07:28,888 --> 01:07:31,431
Maybe you can convince her to try.

799
01:07:32,433 --> 01:07:34,475
John O'Connor!

800
01:07:35,394 --> 01:07:37,154
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget about me!

801
01:07:37,188 --> 01:07:40,857
- They'll never break me. Never!
- Penny, get off the phone.

802
01:07:41,025 --> 01:07:44,944
Dr. Lizardo, really what does she know
about an overthruster? She's not a scientist.

803
01:07:45,029 --> 01:07:48,740
Shall we play...
a Penny for your thoughts?

804
01:07:51,243 --> 01:07:54,329
Maybe you can come in her place, huh?

805
01:07:54,455 --> 01:07:57,540
Yoyodyne, Banzai. You know the address.

806
01:07:57,666 --> 01:08:01,336
Come alone and bring your overthruster!

807
01:08:03,505 --> 01:08:07,926
He'll come. I know his type.

808
01:08:08,052 --> 01:08:10,511
Take her to the pit!

809
01:08:10,638 --> 01:08:12,680
Go, Bigbooty!

810
01:08:15,226 --> 01:08:19,103
Use more honey!
Find out what she knows.

811
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:23,024
These breathing devices Hikita-san has cooked up
will enable you to see them

812
01:08:23,150 --> 01:08:28,488
as they really are, as I've been seeing
them since yesterday - as Lectroids.

813
01:08:28,614 --> 01:08:31,491
In our eyes, they're not very pretty.

814
01:08:32,326 --> 01:08:34,577
Nothing personal, John Parker.

815
01:08:38,207 --> 01:08:42,418
If we blow this today...
there ain't no tomorrow.

816
01:08:42,544 --> 01:08:46,214
We have only 240 minutes remaining.

817
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:49,717
Right. I'm working under the assumption
that Penny still has the overthruster,

818
01:08:49,843 --> 01:08:53,596
but this psycho Whorfin doesn't
know that. So that'll be my job.

819
01:08:53,764 --> 01:08:56,099
To get her and it back in one piece.

820
01:08:56,225 --> 01:09:01,521
Your objective is to 86 Whorfin.
You know your two strike groups.

821
01:09:01,647 --> 01:09:03,231
Apache group, that's you, Reno.

822
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:07,986
Chaparral group, that's you, Perfect
Tommy. Parker'll ride with Chaparral.

823
01:09:08,112 --> 01:09:13,199
It's my guess that no human being
has ever been inside the place.

824
01:09:13,784 --> 01:09:18,705
So who knows what we're gonna find
there. Top priority is the overthruster.

825
01:09:18,831 --> 01:09:22,250
Without it, Whorfin
can't get off this planet.

826
01:09:22,418 --> 01:09:26,129
This homing device will probably
make it very easy to find.

827
01:09:26,255 --> 01:09:28,756
And maybe a lot harder to get back.

828
01:09:29,633 --> 01:09:31,551
Strategic Space Command now reports

829
01:09:31,677 --> 01:09:35,513
all the surveillance satellite
communication jammed.

830
01:09:35,681 --> 01:09:38,099
Jammed? By who? Who by?

831
01:09:38,267 --> 01:09:41,019
Possible atmospheric conditions, sir.

832
01:09:41,145 --> 01:09:43,229
- Solar.
- Solar?

833
01:09:43,355 --> 01:09:47,775
Intelligence confirms that Soviets
are having the same problem.

834
01:09:47,901 --> 01:09:50,611
Should we be on Code Red?

835
01:09:50,738 --> 01:09:53,448
We go to Code Red,
the Russians go to Code Red.

836
01:09:53,574 --> 01:09:55,992
No sense going off half-cocked, Mr. President.

837
01:09:56,118 --> 01:09:58,558
I don't know, but Buckaroo Banzai
has never been wrong before.

838
01:09:58,662 --> 01:10:01,914
The man's been through solid matter,
for crying out loud.

839
01:10:02,082 --> 01:10:03,875
Who knows what happened to his brain.

840
01:10:04,043 --> 01:10:06,127
Maybe it scrambled his molecules.

841
01:10:06,295 --> 01:10:09,672
All I'm saying is,
Mr. President, let's not panic.

842
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:13,134
What's happening?

843
01:10:15,304 --> 01:10:18,514
Electromagnetic pulsar.

844
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:25,355
Russians just gone to
Defense Condition Two, sir.

845
01:10:25,481 --> 01:10:26,939
We've no choice, then.

846
01:10:27,524 --> 01:10:30,777
Mr. President, I am a soldier,
and I'm a damn good one.

847
01:10:30,903 --> 01:10:33,821
I've got enough decorations
to snap a Christmas tree.

848
01:10:33,989 --> 01:10:39,035
All I'm trying to say is - and I hope
I speak for everyone in this room -

849
01:10:39,161 --> 01:10:42,330
is that I am scared.

850
01:10:42,456 --> 01:10:45,041
I'm barely holding my fudge right now.

851
01:10:45,209 --> 01:10:49,837
Stop acting like a goddamn schoolgirl,
General, and pull yourself together.

852
01:10:49,963 --> 01:10:54,050
I'm glad someone has
the balls to face facts.

853
01:11:00,682 --> 01:11:03,142
- Don't embarrass us.
- Have I ever?

854
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:06,562
Give me 30 minutes,
then come in and mop up.

855
01:11:20,744 --> 01:11:22,787
Shut up!

856
01:11:33,924 --> 01:11:36,717
I've had enough of you, Penny Priddy!

857
01:11:42,307 --> 01:11:47,061
Well... Mrs. Johnson, thank you.

858
01:11:47,146 --> 01:11:51,566
It's certainly food for thought.

859
01:11:51,733 --> 01:11:56,028
No answer at the Kremlin, sir.
Just dead silence.

860
01:11:56,655 --> 01:11:59,365
Then I guess the moment is upon us.

861
01:11:59,491 --> 01:12:01,451
Here you go, Mr. President.

862
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:04,454
The Presidential Emergency Action Document.

863
01:12:04,538 --> 01:12:06,456
For your eyes only.

864
01:12:06,582 --> 01:12:08,624
John Hancock these, and Hail Mary.

865
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:11,794
You know, on second thought, maybe
we should think this through a bit more

866
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:15,506
so that future generations
of Americans will...

867
01:12:16,425 --> 01:12:17,633
Oh, wow.

868
01:12:19,636 --> 01:12:23,556
"Declaration of War: The Short Form."

869
01:12:38,197 --> 01:12:42,033
Bring that thing right through the gate.
Straight ahead, straight ahead, come on.

870
01:12:45,662 --> 01:12:49,248
Blacks... are on this planet!

871
01:12:50,125 --> 01:12:53,169
Here, in New Jersey!

872
01:12:53,295 --> 01:12:56,714
Coming to destroy us!

873
01:12:56,882 --> 01:12:58,508
We must act!

874
01:12:58,634 --> 01:13:01,677
Escape or die!

875
01:13:02,638 --> 01:13:04,889
We must work faster

876
01:13:05,015 --> 01:13:08,768
to finish the great vehicle itself,

877
01:13:08,894 --> 01:13:13,481
so we can enter the Eighth Dimension

878
01:13:13,649 --> 01:13:17,735
and free our trapped comrades!

879
01:13:17,861 --> 01:13:20,821
So we can return home

880
01:13:20,989 --> 01:13:24,700
and seize power once again!

881
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:31,332
- What is the greatest joy?
- The joy of duty!

882
01:13:31,458 --> 01:13:36,212
- Louder!
- The joy of duty!

883
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:39,799
History is made at night.

884
01:13:39,925 --> 01:13:45,012
Character is what you are in the dark!

885
01:13:45,138 --> 01:13:48,432
We must work while the clock,
she's ticking.

886
01:13:50,143 --> 01:13:54,730
- We hide, they seek!
- Death to the Black Lectroids!

887
01:13:54,898 --> 01:13:57,942
- Where are we going?
- Planet Ten!

888
01:13:58,068 --> 01:14:00,319
- When?
- Real soon!

889
01:14:07,661 --> 01:14:11,205
Come on over here. Bring it this way!

890
01:14:14,167 --> 01:14:16,752
This way!

891
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:18,713
Now park it.

892
01:14:20,257 --> 01:14:22,508
There's no overthruster!

893
01:14:25,804 --> 01:14:29,223
Get him here! Get him outta there!
I wanna see his face!

894
01:14:31,018 --> 01:14:33,227
It's not here!

895
01:14:33,353 --> 01:14:36,439
Take him to the shock tower.

896
01:14:52,331 --> 01:14:55,916
The equations. Solve them.

897
01:14:56,001 --> 01:15:01,005
Enter your data on this keypad.
And you better be right.

898
01:15:01,173 --> 01:15:05,176
The shock tower is a lie detector.

899
01:15:05,302 --> 01:15:08,721
Any falsehood triggers a brutal charge

900
01:15:08,847 --> 01:15:12,099
to your auditory meatus.

901
01:15:14,353 --> 01:15:16,896
- Open circuit.
- So?

902
01:15:17,022 --> 01:15:21,233
You're not getting jack from me until
you let Penny out of this junkyard.

903
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:25,071
Curse you, Banzai!
Don't you realize what are you saying?

904
01:15:25,197 --> 01:15:28,741
Your whole planet is gonna be destroyed
and you sit here wasting time?

905
01:15:28,867 --> 01:15:31,410
Time? I got nothing but time.

906
01:15:35,082 --> 01:15:39,543
Sealed with a curse as sharp as a knife.

907
01:15:39,711 --> 01:15:43,589
Doomed is your soul
and damned is your life.

908
01:15:44,758 --> 01:15:46,467
Buzz off.

909
01:15:49,262 --> 01:15:51,305
Bigbooty...

910
01:15:51,431 --> 01:15:53,891
more power to him.

911
01:15:54,059 --> 01:15:56,602
Bigbooté.

912
01:15:56,728 --> 01:15:59,689
I want my missing circuit, now!

913
01:16:33,348 --> 01:16:37,351
- Is there something I can help you with?
- Is Buckaroo upstairs?

914
01:16:37,477 --> 01:16:40,229
Hello, Mr. Secretary.

915
01:16:40,355 --> 01:16:41,439
Where is he?

916
01:16:43,483 --> 01:16:46,944
- That won't work either.
- Porco Giuda!

917
01:16:48,989 --> 01:16:50,781
Hey, Banzai.

918
01:16:53,535 --> 01:16:56,162
Take a look at your girlfriend.

919
01:17:00,167 --> 01:17:03,252
Devo lavorare con persone idiota!

920
01:17:07,466 --> 01:17:12,428
She'll live... but only for a while.

921
01:17:12,596 --> 01:17:15,890
And she won't enjoy it.

922
01:17:16,016 --> 01:17:18,768
Only you can save her from a fate

923
01:17:18,894 --> 01:17:22,146
even worse than that of
your friend, Mr. Rawhide.

924
01:17:22,272 --> 01:17:25,983
Missing circuit's in your head, Whorfin.

925
01:17:26,109 --> 01:17:28,360
Bigbooty...

926
01:17:28,487 --> 01:17:30,887
activate your probes.

927
01:17:49,049 --> 01:17:52,849
Slow this sucker down.
I'll handle these birds.

928
01:17:58,141 --> 01:18:00,141
You young gentlemen
have a telephone in here?

929
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:03,270
You wanna jump on the horn and get me
Mr. John Bigboot.

930
01:18:03,271 --> 01:18:04,605
It's Bigbooté.

931
01:18:04,731 --> 01:18:08,984
Oh, hell, if you wanna do anything
nowadays, you gotta do it yourself.

932
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:12,196
- What is your name?
- John Yaya.

933
01:18:12,322 --> 01:18:15,699
John Yaya, huh? And you are?

934
01:18:15,826 --> 01:18:18,026
"John Small Berries."

935
01:18:38,890 --> 01:18:41,892
- He's down there. I feel it.
- We're not...

936
01:18:51,236 --> 01:18:56,907
- It's a nest.
- Birds nest. People don't nest.

937
01:18:57,033 --> 01:18:58,534
Red Lectroid.

938
01:19:22,267 --> 01:19:24,602
Don't touch it. It might be a bomb.

939
01:19:24,728 --> 01:19:25,978
Nah, it's a toy.

940
01:19:30,942 --> 01:19:34,612
- Sit down!
- Sir? Hey, that area's restricted.

941
01:19:34,738 --> 01:19:38,157
Yeah? Not to me!

942
01:19:42,871 --> 01:19:48,083
This I know. This I know.
And I love Whorfin too.

943
01:19:52,505 --> 01:19:55,382
- What is this place?
- It's a bivouac. They sleep here.

944
01:19:55,508 --> 01:19:59,178
- Can they all shoot stingers?
- You better believe it.

945
01:19:59,304 --> 01:20:01,472
- Lizardo. Which way?
- Over there.

946
01:20:01,598 --> 01:20:04,141
- You sure?
- Believe it.

947
01:20:04,267 --> 01:20:06,310
Just once.

948
01:20:41,012 --> 01:20:43,055
- Where...?
- Shh.

949
01:20:45,475 --> 01:20:47,851
What's going on? Where are we?

950
01:20:47,978 --> 01:20:50,729
It's a bivouac, man. They sleep here.

951
01:21:07,288 --> 01:21:09,373
What's happening?

952
01:21:09,541 --> 01:21:12,167
John Isaac, get the boy! Andiamo!

953
01:21:12,335 --> 01:21:15,963
Bigbooty! Go down to the pit. Kill the girl!

954
01:21:19,259 --> 01:21:21,093
Scooter! Where are you?

955
01:21:31,563 --> 01:21:34,440
Hey, somebody turn off
that gosh dang klaxon!

956
01:21:34,566 --> 01:21:39,611
Work. Work. Work.

957
01:21:42,615 --> 01:21:44,825
There are monkey boys in the facility.

958
01:21:45,785 --> 01:21:46,994
You are secure.

959
01:21:48,079 --> 01:21:49,121
Do not panic.

960
01:21:52,542 --> 01:21:54,793
John Emdall must die.

961
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:58,422
Lord Whorfin must live.

962
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:01,216
Work.

963
01:22:01,468 --> 01:22:02,843
Work.

964
01:22:03,094 --> 01:22:04,595
Work.

965
01:22:33,625 --> 01:22:35,042
Sorry. I'm sorry.

966
01:22:35,168 --> 01:22:36,668
- Sidney.
- Buckaroo!

967
01:22:36,795 --> 01:22:39,880
It's good to see you, pal. You got a pistol?

968
01:22:40,006 --> 01:22:41,924
Yeah.

969
01:22:44,427 --> 01:22:46,678
What are you gonna use?

970
01:22:47,764 --> 01:22:50,307
- Where are we?
- I hate to tell you.

971
01:22:51,351 --> 01:22:53,727
Where are we going?

972
01:22:55,688 --> 01:22:57,731
This way.

973
01:23:06,533 --> 01:23:08,117
Get over here.

974
01:23:08,201 --> 01:23:12,204
Keep your noses to the grindstone.

975
01:23:12,372 --> 01:23:14,957
The greatest joy is the joy of duty.

976
01:23:16,167 --> 01:23:19,253
Work. Work. Work.

977
01:23:19,963 --> 01:23:23,382
Monkey boys are feeble.
Lord Whorfin is supreme!

978
01:23:23,550 --> 01:23:29,304
Bigboot! Bigboot! Hold on a minute,
I wanna talk to you.

979
01:23:30,181 --> 01:23:34,810
What the hell's the matter with you?
You deaf? I said I wanna talk to you!

980
01:23:57,333 --> 01:23:59,459
Jesus!

981
01:23:59,836 --> 01:24:03,839
What the hell is going on here,
Bigboot? Where's my bomber?

982
01:24:03,965 --> 01:24:09,094
Bigbooté. John O'Connor,
put the slug on the track.

983
01:24:09,262 --> 01:24:12,181
I don't give a flying handshake
what your name is!

984
01:24:12,307 --> 01:24:15,642
I'm here to see a bomber!
This sure ain't it.

985
01:24:15,810 --> 01:24:19,354
Let's just go back upstairs to my office.

986
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:21,857
Talk about this like
two reasonable beings.

987
01:24:21,983 --> 01:24:25,402
You listen to me. Your private life,
that's your own concern.

988
01:24:25,486 --> 01:24:29,865
But I'm here to see a bomber
and I'm damn sure gonna see it now!

989
01:24:29,991 --> 01:24:34,119
Look at this place. Don't you have
any pride? It looks like a damn pigsty!

990
01:24:35,663 --> 01:24:40,542
It's not my goddamn planet.
Understand, monkey boy?

991
01:24:41,502 --> 01:24:45,802
- Let's get outta here, John O'Connor.
- But John, Whorfin said we could kill her.

992
01:25:15,536 --> 01:25:17,537
You owe me one, Buck.

993
01:25:25,213 --> 01:25:28,048
It's not over yet.

994
01:25:29,008 --> 01:25:32,094
I may be down but I'm not out.

995
01:25:38,226 --> 01:25:41,186
What is that? Don't pick it up. No.

996
01:25:44,691 --> 01:25:46,316
Penny.

997
01:25:47,527 --> 01:25:49,444
How's she doing?

998
01:25:49,529 --> 01:25:52,531
- I don't know.
- There's no overthruster.

999
01:25:52,699 --> 01:25:54,324
- Buckaroo Banzai!
- What?

1000
01:25:54,450 --> 01:25:56,910
There is little time!

1001
01:25:57,036 --> 01:26:00,956
You better come quickly
if your planet is still important to you.

1002
01:26:01,124 --> 01:26:04,584
Leave her to me.
You take care of business.

1003
01:26:05,461 --> 01:26:07,129
Thanks.

1004
01:26:07,255 --> 01:26:09,339
- Go. Go.
- Right.

1005
01:26:12,302 --> 01:26:15,804
- Where's Buckaroo Banzai?
- He's flown the coop.

1006
01:26:15,930 --> 01:26:17,681
- Is the girl dead?
- Yes!

1007
01:26:17,807 --> 01:26:20,684
Then sound the call to board the ship.

1008
01:26:20,810 --> 01:26:23,478
Without the crucial missing circuit,
we'll never make it!

1009
01:26:23,604 --> 01:26:27,899
They're only monkey boys! We can still
crush them here on Earth, Lord Whorfin!

1010
01:26:28,026 --> 01:26:30,986
No. It's time to go home.

1011
01:26:31,112 --> 01:26:34,865
Bigbooty, you carry my overthruster.

1012
01:26:34,991 --> 01:26:37,951
John O'Connor...

1013
01:26:38,119 --> 01:26:40,537
you stick by my side.

1014
01:26:48,296 --> 01:26:53,383
The great vehicle itself
is now in final boarding state.

1015
01:26:53,509 --> 01:26:56,011
What is that?

1016
01:26:56,888 --> 01:27:00,974
It's a troop ship. Lord Whorfin.

1017
01:27:06,147 --> 01:27:09,483
Massacre them without quarter!

1018
01:27:25,708 --> 01:27:31,129
Tell the flight attendants to close
the doors and prepare for a crosscheck.

1019
01:27:40,807 --> 01:27:46,478
If you are not inside the great vehicle
itself, you have missed the boat.

1020
01:27:49,065 --> 01:27:54,027
We are go for launch.
Do not obstruct the great vehicle.

1021
01:27:55,905 --> 01:27:57,781
Do not take to the floor.

1022
01:27:57,907 --> 01:28:01,743
Lord Whorfin will return
for all those left behind.

1023
01:28:01,869 --> 01:28:07,290
Clear the great vehicle. Voltage is rising.
Electromagnetic field is rising.

1024
01:28:13,005 --> 01:28:16,091
John O'Connor! Install my overthruster!

1025
01:28:16,217 --> 01:28:19,636
...all carry-on baggage
overhead and secure.

1026
01:28:19,762 --> 01:28:21,888
Electromagnetic field...

1027
01:28:22,014 --> 01:28:27,018
- What is this?
- It looks like one of our thermopods.

1028
01:28:27,145 --> 01:28:29,187
But it's a very bad design.

1029
01:28:31,315 --> 01:28:37,195
Your tray tables are secure, and your
seat backs in the full upright position.

1030
01:28:37,321 --> 01:28:40,532
Your overthruster
is in place, Lord Whorfin.

1031
01:28:40,658 --> 01:28:42,909
It won't work! It won't work!

1032
01:28:43,035 --> 01:28:46,121
Shut up, John Bigbooty, you coward!

1033
01:28:46,247 --> 01:28:49,875
You're the weakest individual
I ever know!

1034
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:53,003
We are cooking. Over.

1035
01:28:54,630 --> 01:28:58,842
Get away from that, boy,
or I'll drink your blood!

1036
01:29:01,429 --> 01:29:05,098
What you got there, son?
That's not real, is it?

1037
01:29:08,102 --> 01:29:08,977
Get 'em up.

1038
01:29:09,103 --> 01:29:14,024
H2 tank pressurization, OK.
We're go for launch.

1039
01:29:14,108 --> 01:29:20,071
John Many Jars, establish overthruster
beam red. Over. Activate oscillator.

1040
01:29:21,199 --> 01:29:24,784
Pace accelerator's shorting out!

1041
01:29:24,911 --> 01:29:27,746
John O'Connor! My overthruster!

1042
01:29:36,547 --> 01:29:40,258
Wait! Don't leave! Don't leave!

1043
01:29:40,384 --> 01:29:43,261
This is vacuum cylinder three.

1044
01:29:49,602 --> 01:29:53,230
If he can't connect the dots,
they never gonna penetrate.

1045
01:29:56,234 --> 01:30:00,820
Cabin fluid valves were closed.
Problem is corrected. Over.

1046
01:30:00,988 --> 01:30:01,988
What is that?

1047
01:30:02,114 --> 01:30:05,492
Is OK. No worry.
Is an insulating liquid.

1048
01:30:05,618 --> 01:30:08,203
Full speed ahead!

1049
01:30:08,329 --> 01:30:12,082
May I remind you to fasten your seat belts

1050
01:30:12,208 --> 01:30:15,126
and extinguish all smoking material.

1051
01:30:15,294 --> 01:30:18,922
We haven't a chance!
Your overthruster's for shit!

1052
01:30:19,048 --> 01:30:21,628
One more word out of you, Bigbooty...

1053
01:30:21,759 --> 01:30:25,009
Bigbooté! Té! Té!

1054
01:30:27,348 --> 01:30:31,434
Welcome aboard, Banzai. You're next.

1055
01:30:33,604 --> 01:30:35,814
Let's go home.

1056
01:30:43,823 --> 01:30:46,408
The wall is softening.

1057
01:30:48,035 --> 01:30:51,663
- Inertial overtones obtaining command.
- Oh, no.

1058
01:31:04,010 --> 01:31:09,347
Danger! Danger! We do not have
crossover. Negative mass is spreading.

1059
01:31:16,272 --> 01:31:20,525
We're not in the Eighth Dimension.
We are over New Jersey.

1060
01:31:20,693 --> 01:31:22,444
All is not lost...

1061
01:31:22,570 --> 01:31:25,238
Stand by to incinerate Smolensk.

1062
01:31:26,532 --> 01:31:27,907
Jettison!

1063
01:31:28,034 --> 01:31:31,870
So sorry, gentlemen,
but I must dump the excess baggage.

1064
01:31:36,834 --> 01:31:39,753
Arrivederci, Banzai!

1065
01:31:41,464 --> 01:31:46,009
- Where's the power?
- I'm a diplomat! I failed flight school.

1066
01:31:46,469 --> 01:31:48,595
What do we do, jump-start it?

1067
01:32:14,914 --> 01:32:17,999
Rocket stabilizer.

1068
01:32:18,167 --> 01:32:20,210
What this?

1069
01:32:22,129 --> 01:32:24,172
Looks like a gun.

1070
01:32:29,178 --> 01:32:31,513
John Parker, take this wheel.

1071
01:32:34,809 --> 01:32:38,687
Right, just... just hold onto that.
It flies like a truck.

1072
01:32:38,813 --> 01:32:40,772
Good. What is a truck?

1073
01:32:40,856 --> 01:32:44,943
Electric beam is fine, Lord Whorfin.

1074
01:33:06,006 --> 01:33:08,174
Thermopod on our tail. Over.

1075
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:11,845
Banzai! Oh, so you wanna play games?

1076
01:33:11,971 --> 01:33:17,058
- Let's just stabilize her?
- Wanna play hide-and-seek? Huh?

1077
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:22,897
OK. OK. Start left. Go left. More, more,
more, more. Left, left. Left! I said left!

1078
01:33:23,023 --> 01:33:25,775
- This is left!
- I mean my left. Go your right.

1079
01:33:25,901 --> 01:33:27,152
Go.

1080
01:33:27,236 --> 01:33:29,612
Faster! He's gaining.

1081
01:33:29,739 --> 01:33:31,698
Feet, do your stuff!

1082
01:33:31,866 --> 01:33:37,454
More, more, more. Lock in, lock in,
lock in. Now dive, dive, dive, dive, dive.

1083
01:33:37,580 --> 01:33:40,457
Whorfin... sayonara.

1084
01:33:42,710 --> 01:33:48,465
Banzai! I'll see you in hell!

1085
01:33:49,842 --> 01:33:52,051
We've got him!

1086
01:33:52,928 --> 01:33:55,388
- Pull up!
- It's stuck!

1087
01:34:02,062 --> 01:34:04,439
John Whorfin... destroyed.

1088
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:08,109
Deactivate particle beam.

1089
01:34:08,235 --> 01:34:12,572
Tracking 0-0-0.

1090
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:01,246
I thought you bought it.

1091
01:35:01,372 --> 01:35:03,790
- Yeah, me too. Where's Penny?
- At the bus.

1092
01:35:03,958 --> 01:35:06,042
New Jersey helped me bring her back.

1093
01:35:06,168 --> 01:35:08,753
- How is she?
- He said he'd pull her through.

1094
01:35:08,879 --> 01:35:11,673
Quite a guy, if you want my opinion.

1095
01:35:12,633 --> 01:35:14,259
You give me that gizmo

1096
01:35:14,385 --> 01:35:19,889
and I'll give you a brand new
crisp $20 bill. Huh?

1097
01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:25,603
- All right, I'll tell you what...
- Hey, Scooter! Fall in.

1098
01:35:30,901 --> 01:35:33,778
This what you're looking for, Buckaroo?

1099
01:35:35,114 --> 01:35:39,742
- Scooter... you got his job.
- All right!

1100
01:35:39,869 --> 01:35:42,996
- Wanna ride with me in the jet car?
- Wow! You know.

1101
01:35:43,205 --> 01:35:45,456
But I have to ask my dad first.

1102
01:35:46,125 --> 01:35:49,002
OK, you ask your dad, I'll wash up.

1103
01:35:53,465 --> 01:35:55,091
Aw.

1104
01:36:00,848 --> 01:36:02,891
I did all I could.

1105
01:36:06,228 --> 01:36:10,315
Buckaroo, President's on line one. Calling about is
everything OK with the alien space cloud,

1106
01:36:10,441 --> 01:36:12,775
or should he go ahead
and destroy Russia?

1107
01:36:12,902 --> 01:36:15,820
Tell him yes on one and no on two.

1108
01:36:17,114 --> 01:36:20,575
Which was "yes"?
To destroy Russia or number two?

1109
01:37:24,264 --> 01:37:25,890
Penny.

1110
01:37:40,114 --> 01:37:42,156
Careful.

1111
01:37:44,785 --> 01:37:46,828
You're all right.

1112
01:37:50,207 --> 01:37:52,375
You look awful.

1113
01:37:52,501 --> 01:37:57,630
You don't exactly light up
a party yourself... Penny Priddy.

1114
01:38:09,143 --> 01:38:11,811
So what? Big deal!
