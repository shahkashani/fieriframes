I'd back him myself.

Yeah, but you don't
have the money.

You break in here,
I figure it's bad news.

No, Shannon.
it's bad luck.

he has to pick
the wrong one.

813
01:19:20,714 --> 01:19:21,966
He tried to put it right.

814
01:19:22,049 --> 01:19:24,768
Well, he picked the wrong
guy for that, too.

815
01:19:24,843 --> 01:19:28,473
My partner is a belligerent asshole
with his back against the wall.

816

Right now, so am I.

If I don't set this straight,
I'm in big trouble.

01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:40,655
Any idea where
he might be?

Mexico.

820
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:48,037
Or maybe it was Belize.

about this whole thing.

I mean, look
how beautiful.

825
01:20:08,262 --> 01:20:10,685
I wanted to see
my name on this thing.

826
01:20:13,183 --> 01:20:15,732
I think we would have made
a go at this business.
