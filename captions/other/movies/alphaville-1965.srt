1
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:50,125
Sometimes
reality is too complex

2
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,458
for oral communication.

3
00:00:55,292 --> 00:01:00,708
But legend
embodies it in a form

4
00:01:02,167 --> 00:01:05,625
which enables it
to spread all over the world.

5
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:55,167
It was 24.17, Oceanic Time

6
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,083
when I approached
the suburbs of Alphaville.

7
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,958
Silence. Logic.
Security. Prudence.

8
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:43,333
My paper reserved
a room for me:

9
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,958
- You are?
- Ivan Johnson.

10
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,500
- Which paper?
- Figaro-Pravda.

11
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,667
Room 344. Have you registered
at Residents Control?

12
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,208
You must, even if you're
a Festival visitor.

13
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,000
Your bag, sir.

14
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:33,375
- Please, sir.
- Nothing. Get lost.

15
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,208
This way, sir.

16
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,208
You're tired, sir?

17
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,333
You wish to sleep, sir?

18
00:03:56,792 --> 00:03:58,292
It's this way, sir.

19
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:09,792
If you're tired,
you can rest, sir.

20
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,000
Here it is, sir.

21
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,500
The bedroom's here, sir.

22
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:07,333
- What are you looking for now?
- I'm checking if the Bible's here.

23
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:09,542
- Everyone has one.
- Do you believe that?

24
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,458
Yes, of course.

25
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,500
I'll leave you the
tranquillizers in the bathroom.

26
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,667
I'm very well.
Thank you so very much.

27
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:32,583
- Are you going to take a bath, sir?
- Yes, I must reflect.

28
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,042
I'll help you, sir.

29
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,250
And your tie, sir.

30
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:02,708
- Now what?
- I'll take a bath
with you, sir, if you like.

31
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,083
Listen, doll, I'm a big boy.

32
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,167
I can find dames all alone.

33
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,208
Now get lost.

34
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,125
Be polite to the
ladies, Mr. Johnson.

35
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,792
Shit. Now what?

36
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,583
This kid doesn't please you?

37
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,292
And your sister, sir?

38
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:51,417
- I'm getting out of shape.
- What sir?

39
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,208
What's going on here?
Are you on drugs or what?

40
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,625
No, it's normal, sir.

41
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,083
All things weird are
normal in this whore of cities.

42
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,708
Sit in that chair.

43
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,667
Her name was Beatrice.

44
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,958
She said she was a
seductress, third class.

45
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,583
I was struck by the sadness
and durability of her face.

46
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:35,125
Something's not in orbit
in the capital of this Galaxy.

47
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:42,042
Hold this up.

48
00:07:57,792 --> 00:08:00,375
Not bad for a
veteran of Guadalcanal.

49
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:02,250
Just what I was
thinking about you.

50
00:08:02,417 --> 00:08:05,750
Go play your games
with someone else.

51
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:08,167
I've heard it before.

52
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,208
Yes? Mr. Johnson.

53
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:26,500
Miss Natasha Vonbraun
calls for you.

54
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:29,875
Just a moment, please.

55
00:08:39,542 --> 00:08:41,125
Leonard Vonbraun,
inventor of the death ray.

56
00:08:41,292 --> 00:08:42,792
Bring back alive or liquidate.

57
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:48,500
Tell her to wait,
I'll be down in 5 minutes.

58
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:50,917
She's on her way up.

59
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,958
Henry Dickson, Agent X21,
12, Enrico Fermi, Alphaville.

60
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,750
Got a light?

61
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,500
I've traveled 9,000 kilometers
to give it to you.

62
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,875
- I'm Natasha Vonbraun.
- Yes, I know.

63
00:09:32,792 --> 00:09:34,292
How do you know?

64
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,542
You are Miss Vonbraun.

65
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:40,542
Yes, I'm very well,
thank you so very much.

66
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,625
You come from
the Outlands, Mr. Johnson?

67
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,458
- Everything to your satisfaction?
- Yes

68
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:58,167
I've been ordered
to stay in your service

69
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,208
during your stay in Alphaville.

70
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,250
Who ordered you?

71
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,250
The authorities, of course.

72
00:10:12,417 --> 00:10:14,375
You came for
the festival, Mr. Johnson?

73
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,333
Which festival?

74
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:22,292
The big one; that's why
people from the Outlands come.

75
00:10:24,042 --> 00:10:27,333
- In my opinion,
it's silly you did not.
-Why?

76
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:34,208
The festival's nearly over.
No more until next year.

77
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,333
You don't say.

78
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,458
Yes, Mr Johnson.

79
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:52,083
But this evening
there's a gala reception.

80
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:56,292
Very big.

81
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:06,000
At a ministry.
I'm going. Come if you like.

82
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,917
OK.

83
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:17,208
What time? I must
attend to something else first.

84
00:11:18,042 --> 00:11:20,417
You must go to
Residents Control registration?

85
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,083
No. What's that?

86
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:27,208
You mustn't forget to go there,
Mr Johnson. We can meet afterwards.

87
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:31,667
No, I'll go there tomorrow.
First I must meet a friend.

88
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,333
Me too, I've work to do.

89
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,875
I'll give you the
address where I'll be.

90
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:39,750
Call for me and
we'll go together.

91
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,125
OK. In an hour or two.

92
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,167
All right.
See you later, Mr. Johnson

93
00:11:46,542 --> 00:11:48,042
I'll go down with you, miss.

94
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,250
Mr. Johnson,
what's it like in the Outlands?

95
00:12:00,792 --> 00:12:02,500
You've never been?

96
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:07,875
No, but my father told me
about them when I was little.

97
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,750
Now it's forbidden
to think about them.

98
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:13,833
Are you often ordered
to stay with strangers?

99
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,625
- Yes, it's my job.
- Sometimes, it must be nice.

100
00:12:17,792 --> 00:12:21,208
- Why?
- You never have love affairs?

101
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,792
- What?
- Has no one ever
fallen in love with you?

102
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,917
In love? What's that?

103
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,792
There's one thing
I'd like to know, miss.

104
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,083
- Yes, Mr. Johnson.
- Have you finished taking me

105
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:36,667
- for an ass, or are you just beginning?
- Let go of me.

106
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:39,542
But answer me.

107
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,375
I don't understand.
What are you talking about?

108
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:47,042
Realize, Princess. I don't know
what you're talking about either.

109
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:03,625
It's always like that.
You never understand anything.

110
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:18,958
Yes, it's always like that.
You never understand anything.

111
00:13:19,417 --> 00:13:21,750
And one night,
you end it in death.

112
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:37,708
- Which way are you going?
- 12, Enrico Fermi.

113
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:42,542
That's after Heisenberg Boulevard,
not far from Mathematical Park.

114
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,875
- I have a car. I can
give you a lift, if you wish.
- OK.

115
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:47,875
I'll get the keys

116
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,833
- You don't want me to court you?
- What?

117
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:05,917
You really don't
know what it means?

118
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,708
Her smile and her
small, pointed teeth

119
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,542
reminded me of the
old vampire films,

120
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:18,917
the sort they used to show
at cinerama museums.

121
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,542
I'm a programmer, second class.

122
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:51,250
Natasha's a name from the past.

123
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:55,083
Yes, but in life, one can
only know the present.

124
00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:00,125
No one's lived in the past,
or will live in the future.

125
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,542
Thanks for the lift, anyway.

126
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:08,333
It's a pleasure to
do my job, Mr. Johnson.

127
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,208
Is it much farther?

128
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,292
You know we must
cross the North Zone, Miss.

129
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,208
What's the
population of Alphaville?

130
00:15:24,542 --> 00:15:26,708
Don't forget, you must
go to Residents Control.

131
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,375
Yes.

132
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,375
What exactly do you
do for a living?

133
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,125
I work

134
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,042
for a newspaper.

135
00:15:43,917 --> 00:15:46,500
Professor Vonbraun
is your father?

136
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:52,042
It's vital for me to write about him.
Could you arrange a meeting?

137
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:56,958
I don't know. I've
never seen him. I'll ask.

138
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,000
Finally, I leave you.

139
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,333
- Here?
- I've changed my mind.

140
00:16:03,917 --> 00:16:05,542
You have the address?

141
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,083
Yes. Tell him to stop.

142
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,833
Telecommunication.

143
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,292
I'd like to telecommunicate.

144
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:54,042
- Galaxy or local call?
- Local.

145
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:56,167
Cabin 2.

146
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,042
Miss, do you know that man?

147
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,417
Of course I know him.
I'm not stupid.

148
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,750
At the end of Galata Bridge

149
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:50,500
you'll find the
Red Star, my place.

150
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:55,792
You can't compare it

151
00:18:56,125 --> 00:19:03,958
to our splendid
galactic corridors,

152
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:11,542
all a-glitter
with luxury and light.

153
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:20,417
It's only a
vast labyrinth, tall, cramped.

154
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,125
Is this the Red Star Hotel?

155
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,542
Yes, it is, thank you.

156
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,167
- Is Mr. Dickson in?
- He's out.

157
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,875
Fine, I'll wait.

158
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,750
You have money, sir?

159
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:41,875
You can have a seat, sir,
if you're tired.

160
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:51,208
I wanted to see it again,

161
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:54,958
the tomb
of the Duc de Montpensier.

162
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:06,458
The reclining
statue of the Prince

163
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:09,417
is the work of Pradier.

164
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,833
The Prince wears
the costume of...

165
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,208
Henry, it's me!

166
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,417
We've got plenty to talk about.

167
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,792
- Where's my key?
- Where's my money, Mr. Dickson?

168
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,833
- My key.
- His key.

169
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,750
And a beer.

170
00:21:00,417 --> 00:21:01,917
And me?

171
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,208
Why don't you hurry up
and commit suicide?

172
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,583
We need the room
for our cousin from the south

173
00:21:26,792 --> 00:21:29,875
You come from the Outlands?

174
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:33,292
Why did he ask
if you'd commit suicide?

175
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:38,833
There's quite a few...

176
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:50,542
There's quite a few who do.

177
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:55,167
One can't adapt to this place.

178
00:21:55,333 --> 00:22:02,250
It's the method
the Chinese invented

179
00:22:03,292 --> 00:22:07,417
about thirty years ago
in Pekingville

180
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:12,792
Dissuasion is their strong point

181
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,625
What about those who won't
adapt or commit suicide?

182
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:23,833
- Those... they're executed.
- Yes, the authorities.

183
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:27,125
But one can hide, you know.
There aren't many left.

184
00:22:27,292 --> 00:22:29,792
Dick Tracy, is he dead?

185
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,500
And Guy Leclair?

186
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,625
Why didn't we hear from them,
or from you, Henry?

187
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,833
I'm sorry.
These things happen.

188
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:56,000
And what's Alpha 60?

189
00:22:57,583 --> 00:23:03,500
A giant computer, like they
used to have in big business.

190
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:06,750
Nueva York... IBM...

191
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:09,917
Olivetti... General Electric...
Tokyorama...

192
00:23:10,292 --> 00:23:15,667
Alpha 60 is one hundred and fifty
light years more powerful.

193
00:23:18,042 --> 00:23:22,542
I see. People have become
slaves of probabilities.

194
00:23:23,417 --> 00:23:26,500
Their ideal here in Alphaville

195
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:32,958
is a technocracy
like that of termites and ants.

196
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:35,042
I don't understand.

197
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:39,667
Probably one hundred
and fifty light years ago,

198
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:43,333
one hundred and fifty,
two hundred,

199
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:47,250
there were artists
in the ant society,

200
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,042
artists, novelists,
musicians, painters.

201
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:59,417
Today, no more.

202
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,750
Nothing. Like here.

203
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:08,792
Has Professor Vonbraun
organized it all?

204
00:24:09,292 --> 00:24:13,208
He obeys logical orders.

205
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:20,292
Then why didn't you kill him?

206
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:26,875
"Why"... What does
that word mean? I forgot...

207
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:39,833
You know his daughter, Natasha?
Who is she really?

208
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:54,125
It was him they
sent to Los Alamos.

209
00:24:58,792 --> 00:25:02,000
His name wasn't that then.

210
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:09,375
Answer! That wasn't
his name in those days.

211
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,500
Listen, Henry,

212
00:25:19,542 --> 00:25:24,250
we'll get out together.
You'll be OK, but first you must...

213
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,042
It's a terrible secret, but...

214
00:25:46,875 --> 00:25:49,833
Come in, Madame la Marquise.

215
00:25:57,292 --> 00:26:00,250
My coat, Madame Recamier.

216
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:04,000
Thank you, Madame Pompadour.

217
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:08,917
Madame Bovary, Marie Antoinette.

218
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,458
Madame Lafayette.

219
00:26:38,583 --> 00:26:41,167
Madame, it's love.

220
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:50,417
I'll say it in Russian.

221
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:12,875
So young and me.

222
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:45,167
Lemmy... conscience...

223
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:51,250
Alpha 60...
make... self destruct...

224
00:27:51,417 --> 00:27:53,000
Tenderness...

225
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:58,917
Save those who weep.

226
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:09,750
Yes, yes, that's it.

227
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:31,208
The Capital of Pain.

228
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:38,250
14, Light Radiation.
Institute of General Semantics.

229
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:39,791
You know where it is?

230
00:28:39,792 --> 00:28:44,292
Would you prefer I pass
through the North Zone or the South?

231
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,250
What's the difference?

232
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:48,167
There's snow in the North

233
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,750
and sun in the South.

234
00:28:52,292 --> 00:28:55,292
Anyway, it's my journey
to the end of the night.

235
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,583
So, it doesn't matter.

236
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:05,792
It was my first night
in Alphaville

237
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:10,042
but it seemed to me that
centuries had passed.

238
00:29:23,583 --> 00:29:25,083
I'm very well,
thank you so very much.

239
00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:22,958
Miss Natasha Vonbraun.

240
00:30:23,042 --> 00:30:25,667
- Which section?
- Programming and memory.

241
00:30:48,775 --> 00:30:51,692
The Central Memory...

242
00:30:52,942 --> 00:30:55,150
...is thus named...

243
00:30:56,275 --> 00:30:59,900
...because of
the primordial role...

244
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:02,108
...that it plays...

245
00:31:02,525 --> 00:31:08,233
...in the logic-organization
within Alpha 60.

246
00:31:10,358 --> 00:31:14,025
But no one has
lived in the past...

247
00:31:15,275 --> 00:31:20,358
...and no one will
live in the future.

248
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:26,775
The present is
the form of all life.

249
00:31:28,108 --> 00:31:30,358
This quality...

250
00:31:30,817 --> 00:31:35,150
...cannot be changed by any means.

251
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:41,067
Time is like a circle...

252
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:44,108
...which turns endlessly.

253
00:31:45,608 --> 00:31:50,608
The descending arc is the past.

254
00:31:52,233 --> 00:31:55,442
The arc that climbs
is the future.

255
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,775
Everything has been said...

256
00:32:01,192 --> 00:32:05,983
...provided words
do not change their meanings...

257
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:10,192
...and meanings their words.

258
00:32:12,108 --> 00:32:16,567
Is it not obvious that someone...

259
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,608
...who customarily lives...

260
00:32:21,858 --> 00:32:25,275
...in a state of suffering...

261
00:32:26,692 --> 00:32:31,983
...requires a
different sort of religion...

262
00:32:33,692 --> 00:32:40,358
...from a person
habitually in a state of well-being?

263
00:32:42,192 --> 00:32:45,775
Before us, nothing existed here.

264
00:32:46,858 --> 00:32:48,358
No one.

265
00:32:50,192 --> 00:32:53,150
We are totally alone here.

266
00:32:54,358 --> 00:33:00,650
We are unique,
dreadfully unique.

267
00:33:02,608 --> 00:33:05,858
The meaning of words...

268
00:33:06,608 --> 00:33:11,192
...and of expressions,
is no longer grasped.

269
00:33:13,733 --> 00:33:19,608
An isolated word, or a detail
of a design...

270
00:33:21,192 --> 00:33:23,233
...can be understood.

271
00:33:24,275 --> 00:33:30,067
But the meaning
of the whole escapes...

272
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:36,858
Once we know the number one...

273
00:33:37,275 --> 00:33:41,067
...we believe that we know
the number two...

274
00:33:42,067 --> 00:33:47,400
...because one plus one
equals two.

275
00:33:49,567 --> 00:33:53,150
We forget that first...

276
00:33:53,358 --> 00:33:59,025
...we must know
the meaning of plus.

277
00:33:59,192 --> 00:34:00,692
I'm going.

278
00:34:00,817 --> 00:34:04,400
The acts of men...

279
00:34:05,942 --> 00:34:07,817
...carried over...

280
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,108
...from past centuries...

281
00:34:10,817 --> 00:34:13,192
...will gradually...

282
00:34:14,025 --> 00:34:15,692
...destroy them...

283
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:18,150
...logically...

284
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:23,400
I, Alpha 60...

285
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:30,417
...am merely the logical means
of this destruction.

286
00:34:47,475 --> 00:34:48,975
Good night, Comrade.

287
00:34:53,642 --> 00:34:55,267
I thought I'd
never see you again.

288
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,350
- Shall we go?
- I'll get the keys.

289
00:35:04,933 --> 00:35:08,308
I left because I couldn't
understand a word he was saying

290
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,308
but it's very simple.

291
00:35:14,017 --> 00:35:16,142
We learnt this evening

292
00:35:17,017 --> 00:35:18,558
that death and life

293
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:21,725
are found within
the same circle.

294
00:35:29,183 --> 00:35:32,600
- Are you afraid of death?
- Of course not. Why?

295
00:35:35,475 --> 00:35:38,558
We took the tangent
to the center districts.

296
00:35:40,142 --> 00:35:43,183
Traffic bulletins on the radio...

297
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,683
...as Natasha spoke to me
in her pretty sphinx voice...

298
00:35:48,392 --> 00:35:50,100
pretty sphinx...

299
00:35:57,767 --> 00:36:00,683
Foreign ambassadors
usually attend

300
00:36:01,267 --> 00:36:04,350
or delegations
from the districts.

301
00:36:05,308 --> 00:36:07,517
Why does everyone
look so sad, somber?

302
00:36:08,725 --> 00:36:10,517
You ask too many questions.

303
00:36:11,725 --> 00:36:13,558
Because they lack electricity.

304
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,642
The essence...

305
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:24,183
...of the so-called
capitalist word...

306
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:28,850
...or the communist world...

307
00:36:29,933 --> 00:36:34,183
...is not an evil volition...

308
00:36:34,767 --> 00:36:41,142
...to subject their people
by the power of indoctrination...

309
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,975
...or the power of finance...

310
00:36:45,933 --> 00:36:47,517
...but simply...

311
00:36:48,308 --> 00:36:50,392
...the natural ambition...

312
00:36:51,225 --> 00:36:53,183
...of any organization...

313
00:36:53,975 --> 00:36:57,267
...to plan all its actions,

314
00:36:58,433 --> 00:37:00,892
in a word, to
minimize unknown quantities.

315
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:05,267
This dump of yours isn't
Alphaville, it's Zeroville.

316
00:37:26,725 --> 00:37:29,725
- What are we going to see?
- I don't know, light and sound.

317
00:37:41,933 --> 00:37:44,350
- Where is everyone?
- I believe it's already begun.

318
00:37:55,225 --> 00:37:56,725
Hurry. We're late.

319
00:38:16,725 --> 00:38:18,225
It's already begun.

320
00:38:58,142 --> 00:38:59,642
Don't they
electrocute them any more?

321
00:38:59,767 --> 00:39:03,433
Darling, you know the
provisions of 17th Plan took a plunge.

322
00:39:03,642 --> 00:39:05,142
You see, I told you so.

323
00:39:27,225 --> 00:39:28,725
Stay here.

324
00:39:32,308 --> 00:39:34,392
- Introduce me.
- I told you to stay there.

325
00:39:35,767 --> 00:39:38,850
We're with very important people.

326
00:39:39,517 --> 00:39:41,392
- Can I take a photo?
- I'll ask.

327
00:39:47,142 --> 00:39:48,642
Yes.

328
00:40:14,767 --> 00:40:17,267
- What have they done?
- They've been condemned.

329
00:40:20,808 --> 00:40:22,308
Only men?

330
00:40:22,933 --> 00:40:26,600
There's usually a ratio of
fifty men executed to one woman.

331
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:28,850
But what have they done?

332
00:40:29,392 --> 00:40:31,392
They behaved illogically.

333
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:35,433
Isn't that a
crime in the Outlands?

334
00:40:38,392 --> 00:40:42,975
Say, I know him.
He wept when his wife died.

335
00:40:45,308 --> 00:40:46,933
He was condemned for that?

336
00:40:48,892 --> 00:40:50,392
Evidently

337
00:40:50,558 --> 00:40:52,058
we must advance to live.

338
00:40:52,308 --> 00:40:55,100
Aim straight for those you love.

339
00:41:32,808 --> 00:41:34,308
Listen to me, normals.

340
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:37,308
We see the truth
you no longer see.

341
00:41:37,683 --> 00:41:41,475
The truth is that the essence
of man is love and faith,

342
00:41:42,308 --> 00:41:46,142
courage, tenderness,
generosity and sacrifice.

343
00:41:46,892 --> 00:41:49,517
The rest is the obstacle created

344
00:41:49,767 --> 00:41:51,767
by the progress
of your blind ignorance.

345
00:41:57,017 --> 00:41:58,517
One day...

346
00:42:00,433 --> 00:42:01,933
One day...

347
00:42:44,142 --> 00:42:47,850
Sorry, Professor,
but I must speak with you.

348
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,475
I never speak to journalists.

349
00:42:51,767 --> 00:42:56,558
I'm not a journalist.
Can't we talk somewhere quieter?

350
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:01,350
- Goodbye, sir.
- Mr. Nosferatu.

351
00:43:01,767 --> 00:43:03,308
That man no longer exists.

352
00:43:31,058 --> 00:43:32,558
Are you crying?

353
00:43:33,767 --> 00:43:35,683
No, because it's forbidden.

354
00:44:10,183 --> 00:44:12,267
Occupied [...]

355
00:44:13,892 --> 00:44:15,433
Occupied.

356
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:24,850
Free.

357
00:44:28,017 --> 00:44:31,100
Sit there and answer
when you're spoken to.

358
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:34,350
I haven't done anything.

359
00:44:35,142 --> 00:44:36,767
Newcomers must be interrogated.

360
00:44:36,933 --> 00:44:39,142
Alpha 5.

361
00:44:41,808 --> 00:44:43,975
What is your name?

362
00:44:51,017 --> 00:44:52,808
Where were you born?

363
00:44:54,225 --> 00:44:55,725
Nueva York.

364
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,017
How old are you?

365
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:02,058
I don't know... 45.

366
00:45:02,683 --> 00:45:06,142
What make is your car?

367
00:45:09,892 --> 00:45:13,100
What do you love above all?

368
00:45:13,975 --> 00:45:15,808
Gold and women.

369
00:45:17,433 --> 00:45:21,850
What are you doing in Alphaville?

370
00:45:22,808 --> 00:45:24,808
An article for Figaro-Pravda.

371
00:45:25,642 --> 00:45:28,933
You seem afraid.

372
00:45:30,392 --> 00:45:33,350
I'm not afraid...
not the way you think.

373
00:45:34,058 --> 00:45:36,475
Anyway, you wouldn't understand.

374
00:45:38,392 --> 00:45:42,392
Rest assured that my decisions...

375
00:45:42,725 --> 00:45:46,642
...always have in view...

376
00:45:47,683 --> 00:45:49,767
...the ultimate good.

377
00:45:53,433 --> 00:45:55,183
I shall now...

378
00:45:55,808 --> 00:45:59,600
...ask you some test questions...

379
00:46:00,225 --> 00:46:02,350
...as a security measure.

380
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:04,933
No, go ahead.

381
00:46:05,058 --> 00:46:08,642
You have come from the Outlands.

382
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:11,767
What were your feelings...

383
00:46:11,933 --> 00:46:17,017
...when you passed
through galactic space?

384
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:20,725
The silence of infinite space

385
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:22,350
appalled me.

386
00:46:25,017 --> 00:46:27,433
What is the
privilege of the dead?

387
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:31,433
To die no more.

388
00:46:32,433 --> 00:46:37,725
Do you know what
illuminates the night?

389
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,100
Poetry.

390
00:46:44,433 --> 00:46:46,392
What is your religion?

391
00:46:48,517 --> 00:46:51,808
I believe in
the inspirations of conscience.

392
00:46:52,308 --> 00:46:56,475
Do you make any distinction...

393
00:46:57,350 --> 00:47:01,308
...between the
mysterious principles...

394
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:04,850
...of knowledge...

395
00:47:05,433 --> 00:47:08,975
...and those of love?

396
00:47:09,767 --> 00:47:13,600
In my opinion, in love
there is no mystery.

397
00:47:13,975 --> 00:47:17,392
You are not telling the truth.

398
00:47:18,308 --> 00:47:19,808
I don't understand.

399
00:47:20,475 --> 00:47:24,767
You are hiding certain things.

400
00:47:26,017 --> 00:47:28,558
I admit I might
have reasons to lie,

401
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:32,642
but how can you differentiate
between lies and truth?

402
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:37,517
You are hiding certain things...

403
00:47:38,683 --> 00:47:44,642
...but I do not
know yet what they are.

404
00:47:46,683 --> 00:47:52,600
For the time being, you are free.

405
00:47:54,642 --> 00:47:59,225
I should like you to visit...

406
00:48:00,183 --> 00:48:04,392
...the Control Complex.

407
00:48:08,183 --> 00:48:09,892
Come with me, Mr. Johnson.

408
00:48:22,267 --> 00:48:25,517
- Where are we going?
- To the Chief Engineer.

409
00:48:59,475 --> 00:49:01,058
Ah, the day breaks.

410
00:49:16,058 --> 00:49:17,558
Sit down, Mr Johnson.

411
00:49:21,308 --> 00:49:23,433
A momentous occasion.

412
00:49:24,017 --> 00:49:27,142
Yes, we spent three years
looking for Grand Omega Minus.

413
00:49:34,642 --> 00:49:36,433
Well, Mr. Johnson...

414
00:49:39,642 --> 00:49:41,308
How do you find Alphaville?

415
00:49:42,017 --> 00:49:44,600
Not bad, if I knew where I was.

416
00:49:45,225 --> 00:49:49,392
You are in the center
of Alphaville, inside Alpha 60.

417
00:49:53,308 --> 00:49:57,975
The task of Alpha 60
is to calculate and project

418
00:49:58,308 --> 00:50:03,017
the results which Alphaville
will subsequently enjoy.

419
00:50:04,933 --> 00:50:06,433
Why?

420
00:50:06,767 --> 00:50:10,017
No one ever says "why";
one says "because".

421
00:50:12,058 --> 00:50:15,725
In the life of individuals,
as in the life of nations

422
00:50:15,808 --> 00:50:18,642
all is linked,
all is consequence.

423
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:23,767
That's the famous theory
of Professor Leonard Nosferatu.

424
00:50:24,267 --> 00:50:27,100
Leonard Nosferatu
no longer exists, Mr. Johnson.

425
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:33,308
The Outlands expelled him in 1964.

426
00:50:34,517 --> 00:50:37,183
Today there is only
Professor Vonbraun.

427
00:50:38,017 --> 00:50:42,642
I remember. He was sent
to a village in the desert

428
00:50:42,975 --> 00:50:45,.183
to perfect his invention.

429
00:50:46,183 --> 00:50:48,058
He was exiled, you mean.

430
00:50:48,683 --> 00:50:53,933
Now the Outlands
wring their hands, wishing him back.

431
00:50:54,475 --> 00:50:59,850
They flood us with spies.
Perhaps you are a spy, Mr. Johnson

432
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:03,725
You know I'm only a free man.

433
00:51:08,975 --> 00:51:11,892
A meaningless reply.
We know nothing.

434
00:51:13,267 --> 00:51:17,642
We record, calculate,
draw conclusions.

435
00:51:20,933 --> 00:51:24,225
An hour ago,
one of Alpha 60's

436
00:51:24,392 --> 00:51:27,767
1.4 billion nerve centres
questioned you.

437
00:51:27,933 --> 00:51:31,475
Your replies were difficult and
sometimes impossible to codify.

438
00:51:31,767 --> 00:51:34,683
We deduce an
above-average intelligence.

439
00:51:35,308 --> 00:51:40,308
We are sometimes in mortal need
of superior intelligences.

440
00:51:40,475 --> 00:51:43,267
At other times we have a
no less mortal distrust of them.

441
00:51:45,142 --> 00:51:47,183
So what will you do with me?

442
00:51:47,767 --> 00:51:51,308
For the moment, we're
ordered to show you Alpha 60.

443
00:51:51,433 --> 00:51:54,267
Who ordered you?
Professor Vonbraun?

444
00:51:55,225 --> 00:51:56,933
Absolutely not.

445
00:51:57,850 --> 00:52:00,100
An order is a logical conclusion.

446
00:52:01,517 --> 00:52:05,558
One must not be afraid of logic.
Simply that. Period.

447
00:52:08,142 --> 00:52:12,433
The circuit elements...
of 183 Omega Minus... malfunction.

448
00:52:12,892 --> 00:52:15,308
Calculating or memory elements?

449
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,475
Memory.

450
00:52:19,267 --> 00:52:21,767
Professors Eckel and Jeckel.

451
00:52:21,975 --> 00:52:23,475
I'm very well, thank you.
Pleased to meet you.

452
00:52:23,558 --> 00:52:25,058
Me too.

453
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:31,517
I'd like to know what
Grand Omega Minus is.

454
00:52:31,808 --> 00:52:35,100
Our 17th electricity plan
is inadequate.

455
00:52:36,142 --> 00:52:39,933
Sooner or later the
Outlands will declare war on us.

456
00:52:40,767 --> 00:52:43,183
Therefore, we
decided to invade them.

457
00:52:43,392 --> 00:52:46,267
Directed by Professor Vonbraun,
Omega Minus will be

458
00:52:46,433 --> 00:52:48,642
victorious over anti-matter.

459
00:52:48,808 --> 00:52:50,308
I see, it's ideal.

460
00:52:51,475 --> 00:52:53,850
We can perhaps use men like you

461
00:52:53,975 --> 00:52:57,142
to tell us the weak points
of the Outlands.

462
00:52:59,642 --> 00:53:04,933
Your tendency to dwell
in the past...

463
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:08,100
...could be useful to us.

464
00:53:11,767 --> 00:53:16,183
We send those properly brain-washed
to provoke the other galaxies...

465
00:53:16,308 --> 00:53:20,892
the strikes, revolutions,
family rows, student revolts...

466
00:53:21,058 --> 00:53:23,183
That's us: Grand Omega Minus.

467
00:53:23,392 --> 00:53:26,058
- Where now?
- The invisible part of Alpha 60.

468
00:53:31,267 --> 00:53:35,308
You think more
of what has been...

469
00:53:36,433 --> 00:53:38,475
...than of what will be.

470
00:53:43,767 --> 00:53:45,392
It's old, your camera.

471
00:53:45,517 --> 00:53:47,017
The technical...
I don't believe in it.

472
00:53:47,142 --> 00:53:48,642
Yes, of course.

473
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:54,017
Jeckel asked why I
shot the individual in my bathroom

474
00:53:54,767 --> 00:53:57,600
when the whole thing
was just a psycho-test.

475
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:03,600
I replied, because I'm
too old to argue. So I shoot.

476
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,058
It's my only weapon
against fatality.

477
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:15,850
- What's this?
- Central Interrogation Station.

478
00:54:16,183 --> 00:54:18,725
Here Alpha 60 sets itself problems.

479
00:54:18,933 --> 00:54:22,142
The forms and references
used by Alpha 60

480
00:54:22,267 --> 00:54:23,850
are too complex
for human understanding.

481
00:54:24,475 --> 00:54:26,142
What sort of problems?

482
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:29,475
Train and airplane departures...
movement of people and goods...

483
00:54:29,642 --> 00:54:32,933
electricity distribution...
crime suppression... war operations...

484
00:54:34,475 --> 00:54:40,558
Element Seven, malfunction.

485
00:55:10,683 --> 00:55:12,183
What's happening?

486
00:55:13,433 --> 00:55:15,725
It's war with the Outlands.

487
00:55:17,392 --> 00:55:19,600
A simple instruction...

488
00:55:20,725 --> 00:55:23,808
...is usually insufficient...

489
00:55:24,975 --> 00:55:26,975
...to put into...

490
00:55:27,142 --> 00:55:30,308
...execution...

491
00:55:31,475 --> 00:55:36,225
...a task set by Alpha 60.

492
00:55:39,142 --> 00:55:41,142
Do not think...

493
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:43,017
...that it is I...

494
00:55:43,225 --> 00:55:46,683
...who initiate
this destruction...

495
00:55:47,725 --> 00:55:51,433
...nor the scientists...

496
00:55:52,267 --> 00:55:55,683
...who have accepted my plan.

497
00:55:57,308 --> 00:56:00,017
Ordinary men...

498
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,850
...are unworthy...

499
00:56:03,683 --> 00:56:06,725
...of the positions they hold...

500
00:56:06,975 --> 00:56:08,933
...in the world.

501
00:56:09,683 --> 00:56:12,975
Analysis of their past...

502
00:56:13,183 --> 00:56:18,392
...automatically leads one...

503
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:21,642
...to this conclusion.

504
00:56:23,183 --> 00:56:25,100
Therefore...

505
00:56:25,683 --> 00:56:27,767
...they must be destroyed,

506
00:56:29,225 --> 00:56:33,642
that is to say, transformed.

507
00:56:36,725 --> 00:56:40,600
I don't need anyone
to draw it for me.

508
00:56:42,267 --> 00:56:44,350
During these years,
under the direction...

509
00:56:44,475 --> 00:56:47,267
...of Vonbraun
and his assistants...

510
00:56:47,475 --> 00:56:50,517
...Alphaville had developed
by leaps and bounds...

511
00:56:51,017 --> 00:56:55,517
...guided by electronic brains
that developed themselves...

512
00:56:55,642 --> 00:56:58,558
...by conceiving problems...

513
00:56:58,683 --> 00:57:02,517
...that the human
imagination couldn't grasp.

514
00:57:03,308 --> 00:57:06,892
Foreigners were
gradually assimilated...

515
00:57:07,058 --> 00:57:10,850
...especially the
Swedes, Germans and Americans.

516
00:57:11,642 --> 00:57:16,267
The others, the unassimilatables
were purely and simply killed.

517
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:19,975
I walked through
the threat of executions.

518
00:57:20,558 --> 00:57:24,100
Usually, we would
seat them in a room...

519
00:57:24,308 --> 00:57:29,517
...and electrocute them
in their chairs as they watched a show.

520
00:57:29,975 --> 00:57:33,517
Then we'd dump them
into huge rubbish bins...

521
00:57:33,725 --> 00:57:36,350
...and the theater was
ready for the next batch.

522
00:57:36,892 --> 00:57:40,267
If an individual
showed hope of reclamation...

523
00:57:40,683 --> 00:57:45,183
...he was sent to a chronic
illness hospital where...

524
00:57:45,350 --> 00:57:50,350
...mechanical and propagandistic
treatments soon cured him.

525
00:57:51,767 --> 00:57:54,100
I felt that my existence here...

526
00:57:54,225 --> 00:57:58,475
...was becoming a distorted,
twilight memory...

527
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:01,308
...and without a doubt,
a terrible destiny.

528
00:58:02,142 --> 00:58:06,392
I was left only one solution.

529
00:58:09,433 --> 00:58:11,808
It would not be logical...

530
00:58:12,683 --> 00:58:14,183
...to prevent...

531
00:58:14,725 --> 00:58:18,017
...superior beings...

532
00:58:19,475 --> 00:58:21,517
...from attacking...

533
00:58:21,642 --> 00:58:24,475
...the other galaxies.

534
00:58:47,475 --> 00:58:48,975
<i>Put in one token.<.i>

535
00:58:49,558 --> 00:58:51,058
<i>Thank you.<.i>

536
00:58:59,558 --> 00:59:01,058
Going up, sir?

537
00:59:01,517 --> 00:59:04,017
- No, I'll shine my shoes.
- Please, sir.

538
00:59:27,558 --> 00:59:30,267
- This man has the key.
- This way, sir.

539
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:56,600
You're tired, sir?

540
00:59:59,892 --> 01:00:01,433
You'd like to sleep, sir?

541
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:06,808
Yes, to sleep:
perchance to dream.

542
01:00:10,058 --> 01:00:11,600
What are you exactly?

543
01:00:14,892 --> 01:00:17,267
I'm a seductress, third class.

544
01:00:21,058 --> 01:00:23,308
Has your colleague gone?

545
01:00:26,933 --> 01:00:28,433
Who? Beatrice?

546
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:31,808
I don't know;
a blonde with long legs.

547
01:00:33,558 --> 01:00:36,017
She's working
in the peripheral flats.

548
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:40,058
We're only replacements.

549
01:00:41,808 --> 01:00:44,475
Ever heard of the Outlands?

550
01:00:48,433 --> 01:00:49,933
Never.

551
01:00:55,017 --> 01:00:56,517
- Get out of here!
- Why?

552
01:00:59,308 --> 01:01:02,683
If anyone asks,
say you don't know.

553
01:01:04,475 --> 01:01:06,433
I'm very well,
thank you so very much.

554
01:01:28,683 --> 01:01:31,517
If it isn't the little princess.

555
01:01:32,517 --> 01:01:36,350
I was forbidden to come,
but I wanted to see you again.

556
01:01:36,767 --> 01:01:38,267
Not me!

557
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:41,350
Since you're here,
order breakfast for me.

558
01:01:41,558 --> 01:01:43,058
Yes, sir.

559
01:01:44,850 --> 01:01:47,725
Pardon, I'm very well,
thank you so very much.

560
01:01:47,892 --> 01:01:49,392
Me too.

561
01:01:54,267 --> 01:01:55,892
Bow your head.

562
01:02:02,767 --> 01:02:04,267
What is it?

563
01:02:04,642 --> 01:02:06,892
Nothing. Just a thought.

564
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:10,142
What about my breakfast?

565
01:02:14,975 --> 01:02:16,850
I want to tele-order breakfast.

566
01:02:16,975 --> 01:02:18,349
What is your number?

567
01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:19,850
You have a number?

568
01:02:20,017 --> 01:02:23,267
They didn't
give me one at Alpha 60.

569
01:02:23,558 --> 01:02:26,517
Not your control number,
your room number.

570
01:02:34,308 --> 01:02:35,808
Ever heard of this book?

571
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,808
"The Capital of Pain".

572
01:02:42,267 --> 01:02:44,017
Some words are underlined.

573
01:02:53,017 --> 01:02:56,225
We live in the
void of metamorphoses.

574
01:02:58,058 --> 01:03:01,142
But the echo that
runs throughout the day...

575
01:03:02,433 --> 01:03:06,225
...that echo beyond
time, anguish or caress...

576
01:03:07,933 --> 01:03:11,142
Are we near to our
conscience, or far from it?

577
01:03:16,142 --> 01:03:18,225
These are words
I don't understand.

578
01:03:21,142 --> 01:03:22,808
Conscience...

579
01:03:27,683 --> 01:03:30,767
And this:
death in conversation.

580
01:03:36,142 --> 01:03:37,642
And this?

581
01:03:39,392 --> 01:03:43,558
Your eyes have returned
from a despotic land...

582
01:03:46,058 --> 01:03:49,225
...where no one has known
the meaning of a glance.

583
01:03:50,767 --> 01:03:53,267
You've really
no idea what this is?

584
01:03:53,683 --> 01:03:55,350
It reminds me of something.

585
01:03:57,725 --> 01:03:59,225
I don't know what.

586
01:03:59,267 --> 01:04:00,767
Naked truth.

587
01:04:00,933 --> 01:04:02,600
I know it well.

588
01:04:02,767 --> 01:04:04,767
Despair has no wings,
nor does love,

589
01:04:04,933 --> 01:04:06,767
no face, they don't speak.

590
01:04:06,933 --> 01:04:08,808
I don't look at them.
I don't speak to them.

591
01:04:08,933 --> 01:04:10,767
But I am as alive
as my love and despair...

592
01:04:11,642 --> 01:04:14,517
And this:
Dying is not dying.

593
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,475
And this:
The beguiler beguiler.

594
01:04:19,225 --> 01:04:21,558
This:
Men who change.

595
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:25,308
Never heard of
secret messages, Miss Vonbraun?

596
01:04:25,683 --> 01:04:27,308
A secret message?

597
01:04:28,017 --> 01:04:30,350
Don't you know what a secret is?

598
01:04:30,517 --> 01:04:35,183
Yes. Secrets of planning,
atomic secrets, secrets of memory.

599
01:04:37,017 --> 01:04:40,058
Now what are you looking for?
This town is driving me nuts!

600
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:42,975
I'm looking for a bible,
to see if it's in it.

601
01:04:44,017 --> 01:04:47,267
Are you a complete idiot? The
word I'm looking for, obviously...

602
01:04:48,433 --> 01:04:52,558
Where is it? There's
always one for every room.

603
01:04:56,183 --> 01:04:58,017
I'm becoming afraid.

604
01:04:59,058 --> 01:05:02,600
Since you've come, I no longer
understand what is happening.

605
01:05:05,308 --> 01:05:07,808
Me, I think I'm
beginning to understand.

606
01:05:08,392 --> 01:05:09,892
Here it is.

607
01:05:12,892 --> 01:05:17,100
"Conscience"... it's not in it.

608
01:05:17,225 --> 01:05:18,725
I'm very well, thank you.

609
01:05:27,933 --> 01:05:29,433
It's no longer there.

610
01:05:33,225 --> 01:05:35,392
So no one here

611
01:05:35,808 --> 01:05:40,517
knows the meaning of the word
"conscience" any more.

612
01:05:42,808 --> 01:05:44,308
Too bad.

613
01:05:45,808 --> 01:05:47,308
One sugar or two?

614
01:05:56,933 --> 01:05:59,725
That's not a bible,
it's a dictionary.

615
01:06:02,767 --> 01:06:05,683
Isn't it the same
in the Outlands, Mr. Johnson?

616
01:06:05,933 --> 01:06:08,642
Answer me now, what's it for?

617
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:15,892
Nearly every day words disappear,
because they are forbidden.

618
01:06:17,933 --> 01:06:23,558
They are replaced by
new words expressing new ideas.

619
01:06:26,142 --> 01:06:29,308
In the last
two or three months

620
01:06:29,808 --> 01:06:32,600
some words I was
very fond of disappeared.

621
01:06:32,933 --> 01:06:35,767
Which words? I'm interested.

622
01:06:36,808 --> 01:06:39,392
"Redbreast", "weeping",

623
01:06:40,933 --> 01:06:42,475
"autumn light",

624
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:45,808
"tenderness" too.

625
01:06:50,017 --> 01:06:52,517
When I'm with you I'm afraid.

626
01:06:55,308 --> 01:06:59,183
They ordered me
not to see you again.

627
01:07:00,267 --> 01:07:03,725
Who? The Alpha 60 engineers?

628
01:07:10,017 --> 01:07:12,975
- Yes.
- What are you afraid of?

629
01:07:16,642 --> 01:07:19,975
I'm afraid because
I know that word

630
01:07:20,683 --> 01:07:23,308
without ever having
seen it or read it.

631
01:07:24,142 --> 01:07:26,642
- Which word?
- "Le conscience".

632
01:07:27,725 --> 01:07:29,808
"La conscience".

633
01:07:35,142 --> 01:07:38,142
- You've never been to the Outlands?
- No.

634
01:07:38,850 --> 01:07:40,350
Are you sure?

635
01:07:40,642 --> 01:07:42,142
Yes.

636
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,100
You're lying.

637
01:07:45,767 --> 01:07:47,683
Why are you cross with me?

638
01:07:47,808 --> 01:07:50,017
I believe you mustn't say
"why", but "because".

639
01:07:51,392 --> 01:07:52,892
I said "why"?

640
01:07:54,017 --> 01:07:58,183
And if enemy ears are
listening, they heard you, too.

641
01:08:02,433 --> 01:08:07,558
Well, then, I was careless,
because it's forbidden.

642
01:08:10,558 --> 01:08:13,350
Perhaps it's all right
for you to use it.

643
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,100
When did I say "why"?

644
01:08:19,725 --> 01:08:22,767
Another question first:
Where were you born?

645
01:08:23,892 --> 01:08:25,392
Here in Alphaville.

646
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:31,558
Another lie. Perhaps you
don't know, but you're lying.

647
01:08:32,267 --> 01:08:35,267
I must know the truth:
Where were you born?

648
01:08:37,808 --> 01:08:43,642
Here. I told you.

649
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:49,308
No, in Tokyorama,

650
01:08:49,850 --> 01:08:52,433
the Land of the Rising Sun.

651
01:08:53,058 --> 01:08:54,683
Go on, say it.

652
01:08:56,142 --> 01:09:00,517
In Tokyorama, in the
Land of the Rising Sun.

653
01:09:01,017 --> 01:09:04,350
Or in Florence,
perhaps... Where?

654
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:08,642
Try to remember it
for yourself, Natasha. Where?

655
01:09:08,808 --> 01:09:11,225
Where? I don't know.

656
01:09:11,558 --> 01:09:14,558
Where the sky's as
blue as the South Seas

657
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:20,267
Florence, where the sky's
as blue as the South Seas...

658
01:09:21,308 --> 01:09:23,600
Or in Nueva York

659
01:09:28,558 --> 01:09:31,225
where the winter... Broadway

660
01:09:31,350 --> 01:09:34,350
glitters in the snow
like a fur coat.

661
01:09:35,017 --> 01:09:38,100
You see, you
do know the Outlands.

662
01:09:38,475 --> 01:09:42,267
Your father was chased
from Nueva York in '64.

663
01:09:42,892 --> 01:09:45,808
He brought you here,
so you are not from here.

664
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,808
I know what this book is.

665
01:09:50,683 --> 01:09:55,350
A man who came with us from
Nueva York. He wrote these books.

666
01:09:56,975 --> 01:09:58,767
I don't know what became of him.

667
01:09:59,767 --> 01:10:03,933
They live in the forbidden
quarters here; they commit suicide.

668
01:10:05,350 --> 01:10:09,517
I know that Alpha 60
uses them sometimes.

669
01:10:09,850 --> 01:10:11,933
- It controls them.
- How come?

670
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:14,725
Because they write
incomprehensible things.

671
01:10:15,517 --> 01:10:20,225
Now I know:
it used to be called poetry.

672
01:10:22,433 --> 01:10:26,142
It's believed to be secrets,
but really it's nothing.

673
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:34,517
When Control has an
hour or so free it codifies such stuff.

674
01:10:35,517 --> 01:10:37,433
Like everything else,
one never knows.

675
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,517
It can always prove useful.

676
01:10:39,683 --> 01:10:41,683
Absolutely. We're
highly organized.

677
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:48,975
I'd like to leave
with you for the Outlands.

678
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:53,350
But I'm afraid.

679
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:58,892
Now that I've seen you
I'm no longer normal.

680
01:11:01,683 --> 01:11:03,475
When did I say "why"?

681
01:11:04,350 --> 01:11:05,850
Why?

682
01:11:08,892 --> 01:11:12,683
Because... you know
very well, Mr. Johnson.

683
01:11:13,933 --> 01:11:15,433
No, I don't.

684
01:11:16,683 --> 01:11:20,142
At which moment? Tell me.

685
01:11:20,308 --> 01:11:22,933
Quite often. Last night
in the corridor, for instance.

686
01:11:23,058 --> 01:11:24,642
This time you're lying.

687
01:11:27,308 --> 01:11:30,058
When I said I was
falling in love with you.

688
01:11:30,225 --> 01:11:33,100
In love? What's that?

689
01:11:48,392 --> 01:11:49,892
This.

690
01:11:50,933 --> 01:11:54,683
No, I know what that is:
it's sensuality.

691
01:11:55,142 --> 01:11:58,850
No, sensuality is a consequence.

692
01:11:59,642 --> 01:12:01,392
It cannot exist without love.

693
01:12:02,267 --> 01:12:05,017
So what is love, then?

694
01:12:11,133 --> 01:12:13,967
Your voice, your eyes...

695
01:12:14,842 --> 01:12:17,342
...your hands, your lips...

696
01:12:20,717 --> 01:12:22,842
Our silences, our words...

697
01:12:25,467 --> 01:12:27,717
Light that goes...

698
01:12:28,467 --> 01:12:30,508
...light that returns.

699
01:12:32,925 --> 01:12:35,800
A single smile between us.

700
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:41,967
In quest of knowledge,
I watched night create day...

701
01:12:43,133 --> 01:12:46,008
...while we seemed unchanged.

702
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:49,800
O beloved of all,
beloved of one alone...

703
01:12:50,675 --> 01:12:53,800
...your mouth silently promised
to be happy.

704
01:12:56,133 --> 01:13:01,842
Away, away, says hate;
Closer, closer, says love.

705
01:13:06,092 --> 01:13:09,467
A caress leads us
from our infancy.

706
01:13:11,383 --> 01:13:14,383
Increasingly I see
the human form...

707
01:13:15,383 --> 01:13:17,758
...as a lovers' dialogue.

708
01:13:17,925 --> 01:13:19,717
The heart has but one mouth.

709
01:13:20,967 --> 01:13:22,758
Everything by chance.

710
01:13:23,633 --> 01:13:26,258
All words without thought.

711
01:13:27,342 --> 01:13:29,592
Sentiments adrift.

712
01:13:30,425 --> 01:13:32,717
Men roam the city.

713
01:13:33,925 --> 01:13:35,967
A glance, a word.

714
01:13:37,258 --> 01:13:39,633
Because I love you.

715
01:13:41,092 --> 01:13:42,633
Everything moves.

716
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:47,258
We must advance to live.

717
01:13:49,217 --> 01:13:53,092
Aim straight ahead
toward those you love.

718
01:13:55,633 --> 01:13:59,758
I went toward you,
endlessly toward the light.

719
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:07,633
If you smile, it
enfolds me all the better.

720
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:14,508
The rays of your arms
pierce the mist.

721
01:14:15,675 --> 01:14:17,675
Capital of Sorrow.

722
01:14:24,217 --> 01:14:27,300
I must know how
the chief engineer will use me.

723
01:14:27,508 --> 01:14:29,883
As an inter-galaxy
double agent, I think.

724
01:14:30,133 --> 01:14:33,842
- So it's true what Eckel said.
- What?

725
01:14:34,592 --> 01:14:38,508
You send spies to
sabotage the rest of the world.

726
01:14:38,925 --> 01:14:41,633
Of course, you
learn that in school.

727
01:14:47,592 --> 01:14:49,258
Are you going to betray me?

728
01:14:54,217 --> 01:14:58,050
You can't talk
or don't you want to.

729
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:06,508
Can I communicate with
the Outlands from this hotel?

730
01:15:06,633 --> 01:15:09,383
Just ask for Galaxy Service.
You want me to do it?

731
01:15:09,717 --> 01:15:11,800
The Outlands...

732
01:15:11,925 --> 01:15:13,967
I want to telecommunicate.

733
01:15:14,133 --> 01:15:19,425
...telecommunications
are suspended for some days.

734
01:15:20,425 --> 01:15:24,300
- What were you going to say?
- An atomic attack on Alphaville.

735
01:15:24,925 --> 01:15:28,175
I'll explain later, Princess,
but now let's get out of here.

736
01:15:28,342 --> 01:15:31,050
We must find the Professor...
Where does he live?

737
01:15:35,758 --> 01:15:38,342
- Come with us!
- Where?

738
01:15:38,508 --> 01:15:40,425
- Residents Control.
- No kidding.

739
01:15:40,758 --> 01:15:42,342
When he doubles up, get him.

740
01:15:43,383 --> 01:15:46,258
Story 842, Miss.

741
01:15:48,175 --> 01:15:51,508
One day a tiny man
entered a North Zone cafe

742
01:15:51,717 --> 01:15:55,342
and said, "I want a cup
of very hot, sweet coffee... "

743
01:15:56,217 --> 01:15:59,217
adding: "I shan't pay,
because I fear no one".

744
01:16:01,967 --> 01:16:03,592
He drank his coffee.

745
01:16:07,842 --> 01:16:09,342
He left.

746
01:16:11,258 --> 01:16:13,342
He drank his
coffee and didn't pay.

747
01:16:13,550 --> 01:16:17,592
The cafe owner said nothing.
He was afraid of a scandal.

748
01:16:18,717 --> 01:16:21,383
But when the tiny man
repeated the trick a few times

749
01:16:21,508 --> 01:16:24,425
the cafe owner said:
"I've had it. I'll get a tough guy

750
01:16:24,675 --> 01:16:27,175
to beat this tiny man up
if he comes back".

751
01:16:28,842 --> 01:16:31,425
So on the fourth day

752
01:16:31,592 --> 01:16:36,675
when the tiny man said, "I want
a cup of very hot, sweet coffee... "

753
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,300
the tough guy
goes to him and says:

754
01:16:39,842 --> 01:16:42,675
"So you're afraid of no one?"

755
01:16:43,217 --> 01:16:45,050
"That's right".

756
01:16:45,258 --> 01:16:47,008
"Well, neither am I".

757
01:16:47,467 --> 01:16:49,175
"Well", says the tiny man,
"Make that two cups of coffee

758
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:51,425
very hot and sweet."

759
01:16:54,342 --> 01:16:57,300
Meet you outside
Residents Control.

760
01:16:57,550 --> 01:16:59,925
You'll stay here, Miss Vonbraun.

761
01:17:14,383 --> 01:17:17,925
Last night you lied.

762
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:22,092
You organized
Dickson's death. Why?

763
01:17:22,425 --> 01:17:26,508
Your name may be spelled...

764
01:17:26,633 --> 01:17:29,425
...Ivan Johnson...

765
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:35,258
...but it is pronounced
Lemmy Caution...

766
01:17:36,633 --> 01:17:38,592
...secret agent...

767
01:17:39,217 --> 01:17:44,758
...number zero zero three...

768
01:17:45,550 --> 01:17:47,675
...of the Outlands.

769
01:17:49,883 --> 01:17:55,800
You are a menace
to the security of Alphaville.

770
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:58,717
I refuse to become
what you call normal.

771
01:18:01,675 --> 01:18:05,300
Those you call mutants...

772
01:18:06,425 --> 01:18:10,675
...form a race superior...

773
01:18:11,467 --> 01:18:13,508
...to ordinary men...

774
01:18:13,925 --> 01:18:16,883
...whom we have almost eliminated.

775
01:18:17,758 --> 01:18:19,258
Unthinkable.

776
01:18:19,842 --> 01:18:21,800
An entire race
cannot be destroyed.

777
01:18:22,217 --> 01:18:23,883
I shall calculate...

778
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:26,842
...so that failure...

779
01:18:27,008 --> 01:18:28,925
...is impossible.

780
01:18:30,175 --> 01:18:32,592
I shall fight so that
failure is possible.

781
01:18:36,217 --> 01:18:40,300
Everything that I project
shall be accomplished.

782
01:18:41,925 --> 01:18:44,800
Don't be so sure.
I have a secret, too.

783
01:18:46,717 --> 01:18:52,550
What is your secret?
Tell me, Mr. Caution.

784
01:18:55,258 --> 01:18:59,008
Something which
never changes, day or night.

785
01:18:59,967 --> 01:19:04,508
The past represents its future,
it advances in a straight line,

786
01:19:04,633 --> 01:19:07,800
yet it ends
by coming full circle.

787
01:19:08,175 --> 01:19:10,883
I cannot trace it.

788
01:19:11,050 --> 01:19:12,550
I won't tell you.

789
01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:15,175
Several of my circuits...

790
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:19,342
...are looking for
the solution to your riddle.

791
01:19:20,717 --> 01:19:22,425
I will find it.

792
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:27,092
If you find it, you will
destroy yourself simultaneously

793
01:19:27,883 --> 01:19:31,217
because you will
become my kin, my brother.

794
01:19:32,008 --> 01:19:36,633
Those who are not born,
do not weep...

795
01:19:37,967 --> 01:19:40,175
...and do not regret.

796
01:19:40,967 --> 01:19:46,592
Thus it is logical
to condemn you to death.

797
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:50,925
Fuck yourself with your logic.

798
01:19:51,383 --> 01:19:54,550
My judgement is just...

799
01:19:55,758 --> 01:20:00,925
...and I am working
for the universal good.

800
01:20:02,217 --> 01:20:06,675
If you plan to drive us from
the other galaxies, you'll fail.

801
01:20:07,883 --> 01:20:13,300
You will not leave;
the exit is blocked.

802
01:20:13,467 --> 01:20:14,967
We'll see.

803
01:21:23,175 --> 01:21:25,425
Professor Vonbraun:
Do you know where he lives?

804
01:21:25,675 --> 01:21:33,592
Central Palace, South Zone,
behind Raw Materials Station.

805
01:21:33,717 --> 01:21:35,217
Let's go.

806
01:21:44,175 --> 01:21:45,675
Don't budge.

807
01:21:48,925 --> 01:21:51,300
That way I'm sure
you will keep your word.

808
01:22:54,258 --> 01:22:55,758
Out! Out!
No journalists!

809
01:22:55,842 --> 01:22:59,550
Do you know, "journalist" and "justice"
both begin with the same letter?

810
01:22:59,675 --> 01:23:01,633
Tell your boss.

811
01:23:25,008 --> 01:23:27,258
What can I do for you,
Mister Caution?

812
01:23:27,467 --> 01:23:29,967
News travels fast here

813
01:23:30,592 --> 01:23:33,383
because we're very rapidly
entering Light Civilization

814
01:23:33,633 --> 01:23:35,842
at about 300.000 kilometers
per second.

815
01:23:37,550 --> 01:23:40,967
I'm returning to the Outlands.
Come with me.

816
01:23:42,092 --> 01:23:44,342
Stay with us, Mister Caution.

817
01:23:44,467 --> 01:23:48,758
When the war's over I'll
put you in charge of another galaxy.

818
01:23:50,717 --> 01:23:53,300
You will have gold and women.

819
01:24:04,008 --> 01:24:08,717
We are mastering a
science so fantastic

820
01:24:08,883 --> 01:24:12,508
that the old American and
Russian control of atomic force

821
01:24:12,675 --> 01:24:15,467
will seem pathetic.

822
01:24:15,633 --> 01:24:17,133
I see.

823
01:24:17,758 --> 01:24:21,883
You oppose my moral, even
supernatural, sense of vocation

824
01:24:22,050 --> 01:24:26,300
with a simple physical
and mental existence

825
01:24:26,508 --> 01:24:28,633
easily controllable
by technicians.

826
01:24:41,758 --> 01:24:43,800
Your ideas are
strange, Mr. Caution

827
01:24:44,425 --> 01:24:46,342
Some years ago,
in the Age of Ideas

828
01:24:46,550 --> 01:24:49,133
yours would have been called
"sublime ideas".

829
01:25:00,508 --> 01:25:04,508
Look at yourself. Men of your type
will soon be extinct.

830
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:08,425
You'll become
something.worse than dead.

831
01:25:09,758 --> 01:25:12,008
You'll become a
legend, Mr. Caution.

832
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:14,508
Yes, I'm afraid of death

833
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:20,675
but for a humble secret agent
that's a fact of life, like whisky

834
01:25:21,842 --> 01:25:23,467
and I've drunk that all my life.

835
01:25:28,925 --> 01:25:33,342
You never want to see the
Outlands again, Professor?

836
01:25:33,592 --> 01:25:35,092
Goodbye, Mister Caution.

837
01:25:38,675 --> 01:25:41,508
Such people will serve as
terrible examples to those...

838
01:25:41,633 --> 01:25:44,300
...who see the
world as theater...

839
01:25:44,467 --> 01:25:46,758
...when technical power
and its triumph...

840
01:25:46,967 --> 01:25:49,967
...is the only act
in their repertoire

841
01:26:12,925 --> 01:26:14,800
I was running a straight line...

842
01:26:15,050 --> 01:26:18,217
...which, like Dickson's
Greek labyrinth...

843
01:26:19,675 --> 01:26:24,467
...and philosophers were lost,
as a secret agent was too.

844
01:26:40,550 --> 01:26:42,925
In many respects...

845
01:26:43,967 --> 01:26:48,717
...your reactions and your
modes of thought...

846
01:26:49,967 --> 01:26:51,508
...differ...

847
01:26:52,925 --> 01:26:56,300
...from present normality.

848
01:26:57,383 --> 01:26:59,883
The inhabitants of Alphaville
are not normal.

849
01:27:00,717 --> 01:27:02,842
They are the product of mutation.

850
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:09,050
Do you accept our proposal?

851
01:27:10,383 --> 01:27:13,592
Answer silently...

852
01:27:14,550 --> 01:27:17,383
...with "yes" or "no".

853
01:27:18,717 --> 01:27:21,008
I'll never betray the Outlands.

854
01:29:11,550 --> 01:29:14,008
The present is terrifying...

855
01:29:14,133 --> 01:29:19,633
...because it is irreversible,
and because it is of iron.

856
01:29:21,342 --> 01:29:26,883
Time is the substance
of which I am made.

857
01:29:56,175 --> 01:30:00,008
Time is a river
which carries me along.

858
01:30:01,258 --> 01:30:03,092
But I am time.

859
01:30:04,133 --> 01:30:08,758
It's a tiger, tearing me apart,
but I'm the tiger.

860
01:30:09,008 --> 01:30:11,758
Look at her and me.
There's your answer.

861
01:30:12,342 --> 01:30:14,383
We're happiness, and
we're heading towards it.

862
01:30:15,675 --> 01:30:20,300
It is our misfortune
that the world is reality.

863
01:30:21,092 --> 01:30:22,592
And I...

864
01:30:23,175 --> 01:30:28,258
...it is my misfortune
that I am myself, Alpha 60.

865
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:47,300
Natasha, quick...

866
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:55,008
...think of the word "love".

867
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:03,800
Here

868
01:32:09,883 --> 01:32:14,383
not all the inhabitants died,
but all were stricken.

869
01:32:15,425 --> 01:32:18,842
Those not asphyxiated
by the absence of light...

870
01:32:19,592 --> 01:32:23,258
...circled crazily, like ants.

871
01:32:25,633 --> 01:32:28,758
It was 23.15, Oceanic Time...

872
01:32:28,925 --> 01:32:32,967
...when Natasha and I left
Alphaville by the peripheral roads.

873
01:32:33,758 --> 01:32:38,342
A night drive across
intersidereal space, and we'd be home.

874
01:32:40,175 --> 01:32:41,925
Don't look back.

875
01:32:42,925 --> 01:32:45,758
- Do you think they're all dead?
- Not yet.

876
01:32:47,550 --> 01:32:54,092
They may recover, and Alphaville
will be happy, like Florence,

877
01:32:54,717 --> 01:32:57,842
like Angouleme-City,
like Tokyorama.

878
01:32:58,967 --> 01:33:00,842
You can't go back.

879
01:33:05,175 --> 01:33:09,758
- Have I slept for long?
- No, the space of an instant.

880
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:13,508
Where are we?
In the Outlands?

881
01:33:14,758 --> 01:33:16,258
Not yet.

882
01:33:18,717 --> 01:33:20,842
You're looking at me
with an odd face.

883
01:33:25,633 --> 01:33:27,883
You're waiting
for me to say something.

884
01:33:31,842 --> 01:33:33,383
I don't know what to say.

885
01:33:34,883 --> 01:33:36,883
They're words I don't know.

886
01:33:38,675 --> 01:33:40,717
I wasn't taught them.

887
01:33:42,925 --> 01:33:44,425
Help me.

888
01:33:45,342 --> 01:33:49,092
Impossible, Princess.
You must get there yourself.

889
01:33:49,217 --> 01:33:51,800
Then you'll be saved.
If you don't,

890
01:33:52,008 --> 01:33:54,425
you're as lost
as the dead of Alphaville.

891
01:33:59,175 --> 01:34:00,675
I...

892
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:04,925
you...

893
01:34:09,425 --> 01:34:10,925
love...

894
01:34:12,883 --> 01:34:14,383
I love you.
