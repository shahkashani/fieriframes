1
00:00:44,984 --> 00:00:48,488
Suzy Bannion decided to
perfect her ballet studies...

2
00:00:48,488 --> 00:00:51,324
In the most famous school of dance in Europe.

3
00:00:51,324 --> 00:00:55,161
She chose the celebrated academy of Freiburg.

4
00:00:55,161 --> 00:00:58,998
One day at 9:00 in the morning,
She left Kennedy airport, New york,

5
00:00:58,998 --> 00:01:02,835
And arrived in Germany at
10:40 p.m. Local time.

6
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,422
Taxi!

7
00:02:31,924 --> 00:02:33,926
Taxi, taxi!

8
00:02:35,928 --> 00:02:38,264
Taxi! Hey, taxi!

9
00:02:52,195 --> 00:02:54,197
Taxi! Taxi!

10
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,202
Can you give me a hand?

11
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,223
Uh, Escherstrausse.

12
00:03:20,223 --> 00:03:23,476
- Was?
- Escherstrausse.

13
00:03:23,476 --> 00:03:25,478
Was?

14
00:03:29,732 --> 00:03:32,485
Ah, Escherstrausse.

15
00:03:32,985 --> 00:03:34,821
Ja, ja.

16
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,542
Has it been raining this hard for long?

17
00:04:34,547 --> 00:04:37,800
Half an hour.

18
00:05:45,952 --> 00:05:48,454
Can you wait a minute, please?

19
00:06:08,224 --> 00:06:10,226
- Hello?
- Who is it?

20
00:06:10,226 --> 00:06:13,730
Suzy Bannion. I just got in from New York.

21
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,233
- I don't know you. Go away!
- But I have the letter you sent.

22
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:20,737
Look, it's really raining hard. You
could just let me in and I'll explain.

23
00:06:20,737 --> 00:06:23,239
- Go away. Go away!
- But you don't understand!

24
00:06:25,742 --> 00:06:29,245
Wait! Wait a minute. Wait.

25
00:06:32,248 --> 00:06:34,751
Hello. Is anybody there?

26
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,753
Hello?

27
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:59,085
If you're happy enough with the couch,
you can stay for as long as you please.

28
00:07:59,585 --> 00:08:02,588
Thanks, but I'll be leaving in the morning.

29
00:08:02,588 --> 00:08:05,591
- I'm going away forever.
- Oh, big deal, kid.

30
00:08:05,591 --> 00:08:08,094
So what if you've been thrown out of school?

31
00:08:08,594 --> 00:08:12,098
I always got kicked out of school,
beginning in kindergarten.

32
00:08:12,098 --> 00:08:15,601
No, that's not it. I don't give a
damn about getting kicked out.

33
00:08:16,018 --> 00:08:17,854
Well, then?

34
00:08:17,854 --> 00:08:20,356
It's useless to try and explain it to you.

35
00:08:20,356 --> 00:08:22,358
You wouldn't understand.

36
00:08:22,358 --> 00:08:24,861
It all seems so... Absurd,

37
00:08:25,361 --> 00:08:26,863
So fantastic.

38
00:08:27,363 --> 00:08:32,785
All I can do is get away from
here as soon as possible.

39
00:08:32,869 --> 00:08:35,872
Would you mind if I used the
bathroom? I'd like to dry off.

40
00:08:35,872 --> 00:08:38,291
No, of course not. Go ahead.

41
00:09:00,813 --> 00:09:03,316
Hey, why don't you close it?

42
00:09:06,319 --> 00:09:09,322
That's better. It was just the wind.

43
00:09:10,823 --> 00:09:13,326
You sure are in bad shape.

44
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:16,662
You have to tell me all about it.

45
00:09:16,662 --> 00:09:20,666
The wind! The windows burst open.

46
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:24,170
- I got scared.
- No. That's not it.

47
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,673
I mean, what it is that's got you so upset.

48
00:09:31,677 --> 00:09:34,680
Okay, you can tell me about it later.

49
00:11:53,736 --> 00:11:56,155
Let me in! Pat!

50
00:11:58,908 --> 00:12:00,910
Pat! Pat!

51
00:12:04,914 --> 00:12:09,001
Help me! Help me!
There's a murderer!

52
00:12:10,753 --> 00:12:15,675
Help me! Help!
There's a murderer!

53
00:12:22,515 --> 00:12:25,017
Help me! Help!

54
00:12:25,435 --> 00:12:27,437
No! No! No!

55
00:12:40,783 --> 00:12:43,286
Help me!

56
00:12:52,295 --> 00:12:54,297
Help!

57
00:12:58,384 --> 00:13:01,554
There's a murderer!

58
00:13:22,158 --> 00:13:25,411
No!

59
00:15:18,941 --> 00:15:21,444
Good morning. Good morning, Daniel.

60
00:15:21,444 --> 00:15:23,446
Good morning, miss Tanner.

61
00:15:26,366 --> 00:15:29,369
- Good morning. May I help you?
- Yes, I'm Suzy Bannion.

62
00:15:29,869 --> 00:15:32,372
We expected you yesterday evening.
You wrote us that...

63
00:15:32,372 --> 00:15:34,874
Right. I did arrive
last night about 10:00.

64
00:15:34,874 --> 00:15:37,877
But the door was locked,
and somebody on the call box...

65
00:15:37,877 --> 00:15:40,380
Said they didn't know who
I was and couldn't let me in.

66
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,883
- Who said that to you?
- I don't know. She didn't say her name.

67
00:15:43,883 --> 00:15:46,886
I'm so sorry. At any rate,
Now you're here among us,

68
00:15:46,886 --> 00:15:51,391
So welcome to our academy. I'm miss
Tanner, one of the instructors.

69
00:15:51,391 --> 00:15:53,393
Nice to meet you.

70
00:15:53,393 --> 00:15:56,396
Come along. I'd like to
introduce you to madame Blanc,

71
00:15:56,396 --> 00:15:58,398
Our vice directress.

72
00:15:58,398 --> 00:16:00,400
She was a very famous ballerina.

73
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,402
- Madame Blanc?
- Yes?

74
00:16:02,735 --> 00:16:05,738
Suzy Bannion, our new student.

75
00:16:05,988 --> 00:16:07,490
Oh, yes.

76
00:16:09,992 --> 00:16:12,412
- Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Of course, madame.

77
00:16:12,912 --> 00:16:18,418
You're pretty. Very pretty
indeed. They're policemen.

78
00:16:18,418 --> 00:16:22,922
I knew a woman called Bannion years
ago in New York. Carol Bannion.

79
00:16:22,922 --> 00:16:25,925
- She's my aunt.
- Good! She's a marvelous woman,

80
00:16:25,925 --> 00:16:28,428
A friend and benefactress
of artists everywhere.

81
00:16:28,428 --> 00:16:31,931
I'm delighted to have her niece here.

82
00:16:32,014 --> 00:16:35,017
Well, I offer our academy's official
welcome in the name of our directress,

83
00:16:35,518 --> 00:16:37,520
Who unfortunately is not
here at the moment.

84
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,023
- She's traveling abroad.
- Thank you.

85
00:16:40,023 --> 00:16:44,027
Albert, please wait for me upstairs.

86
00:16:44,027 --> 00:16:47,030
He's my nephew. I'm very attached to him.

87
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,032
I must tell you what I
have to say very quickly...

88
00:16:49,532 --> 00:16:51,534
Because those gentlemen
are waiting for me.

89
00:16:51,534 --> 00:16:54,537
Something terrible, truly
horrible, has happened.

90
00:16:54,537 --> 00:16:59,542
One of our students, Pat Hingle, who was
expelled just yesterday for improper conduct,

91
00:16:59,542 --> 00:17:03,796
Was murdered last night by some
madman. It's a frightening story.

92
00:17:03,796 --> 00:17:06,299
But I always warn our students,
Don't I, miss Tanner?

93
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:08,801
I tell them to be careful, not to get
involved with questionable friendships.

94
00:17:09,218 --> 00:17:12,805
What I wanted to tell you was that
your room here isn't free yet.

95
00:17:12,805 --> 00:17:14,807
- Just a slight hitch.
- Yes, but don't worry.

96
00:17:15,308 --> 00:17:19,312
We've found you a place to stay with one of
our third-year students who lives in town.

97
00:17:19,312 --> 00:17:22,815
You'll have to pay 50 of your
American dollars a week,

98
00:17:22,815 --> 00:17:25,818
But it's a good price, and you can
deduct it from your fee here.

99
00:17:25,818 --> 00:17:29,322
Now I entrust you to the care of miss Tanner,
one of our veteran teachers here.

100
00:17:29,822 --> 00:17:35,328
Don't be upset if she seems a little
stern or surly. It's only her manner.
She's even that way with me.

101
00:17:35,328 --> 00:17:38,331
She really is an invaluable teacher.

102
00:17:38,748 --> 00:17:42,752
- Come with me.
- And now, gentlemen...

103
00:17:42,752 --> 00:17:46,005
As you know, our courses last three years,

104
00:17:46,005 --> 00:17:48,508
And you must pass an exam
at the end of each year.

105
00:17:49,008 --> 00:17:51,511
So, the girl left the school
About 11:00 in the evening?

106
00:17:51,511 --> 00:17:55,515
- That's my information.
- Excuse me.

107
00:17:55,515 --> 00:17:59,018
When I got here last night about 11:00,
I saw a girl leaving the school.

108
00:17:59,018 --> 00:18:02,522
She's a new student. She just
arrived. What did she look like?

109
00:18:02,522 --> 00:18:06,526
Well, she had blonde hair and
was wearing a brown raincoat.

110
00:18:07,026 --> 00:18:11,030
- What did she do?
- I don't know. I only saw her
for a minute in a storm.

111
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:14,033
So you see? It really was 11:00.

112
00:18:14,033 --> 00:18:17,036
Coming?

113
00:18:17,537 --> 00:18:22,041
We don't teach you how to dance here,
because we presume our students already know how.

114
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:26,045
This is an established academy
dedicated to specializing.

115
00:18:26,045 --> 00:18:29,048
This is Pavlos, our general handyman.

116
00:18:29,048 --> 00:18:31,801
He's really ugly, isn't he?
Don't be afraid to say so.

117
00:18:31,801 --> 00:18:34,637
He can't understand you, anyway.
He speaks only Romanian.

118
00:18:34,637 --> 00:18:39,142
You see that gorgeous smile? He's been very
handsome ever since he got those false teeth.

119
00:18:43,146 --> 00:18:46,149
Last year, he discovered He
had gingivitis of the gums,

120
00:18:46,149 --> 00:18:48,651
So he had all his teeth pulled.

121
00:18:48,651 --> 00:18:51,654
The top row one morning.
The bottom row a day later.

122
00:18:51,654 --> 00:18:53,656
Bang.

123
00:18:53,656 --> 00:18:56,159
- Where are we going?
- To the locker room.

124
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:59,662
We also have a swimming pool,
which you can use when you want.

125
00:19:03,082 --> 00:19:07,587
Miss Tanner. I have something to tell you.

126
00:19:07,587 --> 00:19:10,590
- Squawk, squawk. Polly parrot.
- Who said that? Shut up.

127
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,092
That's enough of these little
games for the moment.

128
00:19:13,092 --> 00:19:17,096
I want to introduce Suzy Bannion, our new student.

129
00:19:17,096 --> 00:19:21,100
You'll find several fellow Americans
among these girls... Miriam, for one.

130
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:24,103
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Your locker's over there.

131
00:19:24,103 --> 00:19:26,606
You'll find everything in there except shoes.

132
00:19:26,606 --> 00:19:30,610
For today, you can borrow shoes
from someone who has two pairs.

133
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:34,614
Hurry up, everybody. I'll be waiting
for all of you in the red room.

134
00:19:35,615 --> 00:19:37,617
Come with me.

135
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:49,629
Mata Hari is going to file her report.

136
00:19:53,132 --> 00:19:56,135
My name is Olga, and you're my tenant.

137
00:19:56,135 --> 00:19:58,137
Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

138
00:19:58,137 --> 00:20:01,140
They tell me you have to give me $50 a week.

139
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,643
- Yeah.
- In advance.

140
00:20:03,643 --> 00:20:06,145
Well, don't worry. If you think I'm not... Oh...

141
00:20:06,145 --> 00:20:10,149
Don't get hot under the collar.
That's how people are here.

142
00:20:13,152 --> 00:20:15,154
Uh, can anybody lend me a pair of shoes?

143
00:20:15,154 --> 00:20:18,157
- Yes. Me.
- Oh, thank you.

144
00:20:18,157 --> 00:20:21,160
If you want to buy them, I can make
you a nice price. Fifteen marks.

145
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,163
Oh, no, thanks. I already have some in my suitcase.

146
00:20:24,163 --> 00:20:26,165
I just need a pair for today.

147
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,167
But if you'd rather not...

148
00:20:28,668 --> 00:20:31,170
No. Okay. Go ahead. Take them.

149
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:34,173
- But, uh, Give them back, hmm?
- Of course.

150
00:20:38,678 --> 00:20:41,180
Oh, excuse me.
I'm sorry.

151
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,182
Oh, it's okay. It doesn't matter.

152
00:20:48,187 --> 00:20:51,190
Did they shake you up with all
that talk about money?

153
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,192
Well, I'm not exactly used to it.

154
00:20:53,693 --> 00:20:55,695
Same with me at first.

155
00:20:55,695 --> 00:20:58,197
Then I found out it's a
charming habit around here.

156
00:21:04,704 --> 00:21:06,706
I once read that names...

157
00:21:06,706 --> 00:21:10,209
Which begin With the letter "S"...

158
00:21:10,209 --> 00:21:12,712
Are the names of snakes.

159
00:21:18,885 --> 00:21:20,887
Next year, after I finish the course,

160
00:21:20,887 --> 00:21:23,890
I've got an offer from the
state school of ballet in Geneva.

161
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,893
What about you?

162
00:21:26,893 --> 00:21:30,897
Well, I'll go back to yhe states,
but I'm not exactly sure what I'll do.

163
00:21:31,898 --> 00:21:34,400
Hey, thanks.
My room is really pretty.

164
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,402
- Like it?
- Uh-huh.

165
00:21:36,402 --> 00:21:40,907
That makes me happy. I bet we'll do
nicely together. I think you're sweet.

166
00:21:40,907 --> 00:21:42,909
Even if I have the name of a snake?

167
00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:44,911
I was just kidding.

168
00:21:44,911 --> 00:21:47,413
Don't tell me you're as touchy as Sara.

169
00:21:47,413 --> 00:21:49,916
No.

170
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,922
Hello?

171
00:21:55,922 --> 00:21:58,925
Oh, hi! No, no, no.

172
00:21:58,925 --> 00:22:00,927
You did the right thing.

173
00:22:02,428 --> 00:22:04,430
- Hi.
- Hi.

174
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,683
Oh, you didn't have to bring these over here.

175
00:22:06,683 --> 00:22:09,185
I could've picked them up myself tomorrow.

176
00:22:09,686 --> 00:22:11,688
I thought you might be needing them.

177
00:22:11,688 --> 00:22:13,690
Yes, but it really wasn't necessary.

178
00:22:14,691 --> 00:22:18,194
- Anyway, thanks a lot.
- Oh, no. It's nothing.

179
00:22:18,695 --> 00:22:20,697
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

180
00:22:20,697 --> 00:22:23,700
- Don't you want to stay for a while?
- No, thanks. I can't.

181
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,704
I live at the school, so I've got to
be back for supper in half an hour.

182
00:22:27,704 --> 00:22:29,706
- I have to.
- Just for a minute?

183
00:22:29,706 --> 00:22:32,208
No, no, really. I have to be going.

184
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:35,211
They get very upset if you
show up late for supper.

185
00:22:35,211 --> 00:22:39,716
- Okay, sunday. No, not before lunchtime.
- Well, ciao.

186
00:22:39,716 --> 00:22:42,218
See you tomorrow.

187
00:22:42,218 --> 00:22:44,220
Bye.

188
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,222
No, go on.

189
00:22:48,224 --> 00:22:50,226
Uh-huh, I know.

190
00:22:50,727 --> 00:22:54,230
You caught one. Yes, yes, I can
hear you very well.

191
00:22:54,731 --> 00:22:56,232
Didn't you see how he was blushing?

192
00:22:56,733 --> 00:22:59,235
He's cute, except he doesn't have any, um...

193
00:22:59,235 --> 00:23:02,739
And he never has enough money
for room and board at school.

194
00:23:02,739 --> 00:23:05,241
That's why that bitch Tanner
has got him under her thumb.

195
00:23:05,241 --> 00:23:07,744
She gives him 1,001 errands to do.

196
00:23:07,744 --> 00:23:10,747
Sure.

197
00:23:10,747 --> 00:23:12,749
I got it. Okay.

198
00:23:12,749 --> 00:23:15,752
Call me back tomorrow evening.
Give me a chance to think it over.

199
00:23:15,752 --> 00:23:18,087
Yes, yes. Okay, okay.

200
00:23:18,087 --> 00:23:20,590
Anyway, he is cute.

201
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:23,593
Poor Pat. She liked him a lot.

202
00:23:24,594 --> 00:23:27,597
That poor kid, ending up like that.

203
00:23:27,597 --> 00:23:30,099
I can't even think about it.

204
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,602
I heard you saw her yesterday evening.

205
00:23:33,102 --> 00:23:35,605
Uh-huh. Outside the school.

206
00:23:35,605 --> 00:23:38,107
She was acting very strange.

207
00:23:38,608 --> 00:23:40,109
Mumbling to herself.

208
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:45,782
She really felt terrible when they kicked
her out, but she really deserved it.

209
00:23:47,283 --> 00:23:50,787
- There was so much noise.
- God, was she difficult.

210
00:23:50,787 --> 00:23:53,289
She was saying things that made no sense.

211
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:56,793
She was always arguing, causing trouble.

212
00:23:57,043 --> 00:24:00,046
"Secret."

213
00:24:00,296 --> 00:24:02,799
"Iris."

214
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,300
What?

215
00:24:06,803 --> 00:24:08,805
Uh, I remember...

216
00:24:08,805 --> 00:24:10,807
She mentioned the word "secret."

217
00:24:11,307 --> 00:24:14,811
And then she... Mentioned a flower...

218
00:24:14,811 --> 00:24:16,813
Iris, I think, or a lilac.

219
00:24:16,813 --> 00:24:19,315
Secret flowers? What's
that supposed to mean?

220
00:24:19,315 --> 00:24:22,318
I don't know. She was a busybody.

221
00:24:22,318 --> 00:24:26,322
It would've been easy for her to
find out one of us was in a jam.

222
00:24:56,269 --> 00:24:59,272
- How do you like it at Olga's?
- It's nice.

223
00:24:59,272 --> 00:25:03,276
Those eight on the list this morning,
come with me to the yellow room.

224
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:09,282
Good morning, miss Tanner. Suzy.

225
00:25:09,282 --> 00:25:12,285
- Good morning, madame Blanc.
- I've got good news for you.

226
00:25:12,285 --> 00:25:15,288
We have it all arranged.
Your room is ready for you.

227
00:25:15,788 --> 00:25:18,291
Isn't that marvelous? You can
move in today, if you like.

228
00:25:18,791 --> 00:25:20,793
But I'd rather stay at Olga's, if it's okay.

229
00:25:21,294 --> 00:25:23,296
Doesn't matter to me, my dear,

230
00:25:23,296 --> 00:25:26,299
But in your letter of enrollment, you
said you'd be boarding at the school.

231
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:29,302
- I know, but...
- The room is free now.

232
00:25:29,302 --> 00:25:32,805
- Well, I didn't think it was so important.
- As you wish.

233
00:25:32,805 --> 00:25:35,308
If that's what you want, so be it.

234
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,822
Sara?

235
00:25:52,825 --> 00:25:55,828
I had no idea you were so strong-willed.

236
00:25:55,828 --> 00:25:58,831
I see that when you make up
your mind about something,

237
00:25:58,831 --> 00:26:01,334
Nothing will change it for you.

238
00:26:01,334 --> 00:26:03,336
My compliments.

239
00:26:44,961 --> 00:26:46,879
Witch!

240
00:27:44,771 --> 00:27:47,273
And then, toward the end of the 19th century,

241
00:27:47,774 --> 00:27:50,276
The technique of classical ballet...

242
00:27:50,276 --> 00:27:53,780
Assumed a different, more stylized impostation.

243
00:27:55,281 --> 00:27:57,784
All right. Let's warm up.

244
00:27:58,284 --> 00:28:00,787
What's wrong? Don't you feel well?

245
00:28:00,787 --> 00:28:04,290
No, it's nothing. I just feel a little weak.

246
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:06,793
If it gets any worse, I'll just stop.

247
00:28:06,793 --> 00:28:08,795
And now some exercises.

248
00:28:08,795 --> 00:28:11,798
Daniel, you may begin.

249
00:28:16,969 --> 00:28:20,973
One, two, three and four.

250
00:28:20,973 --> 00:28:23,476
And one and two...

251
00:28:23,476 --> 00:28:25,978
And three and four.

252
00:28:26,062 --> 00:28:27,563
And one and two...

253
00:28:28,064 --> 00:28:29,565
And three and four.

254
00:28:30,066 --> 00:28:31,567
- And one...
- I'm sorry, miss Tanner.

255
00:28:32,068 --> 00:28:35,071
I feel a little weak. Can I
just rest for a second?

256
00:28:35,071 --> 00:28:38,324
Weak? Come on. It's an easy step.

257
00:28:38,324 --> 00:28:40,827
This is the first time we've worked together.

258
00:28:41,327 --> 00:28:43,830
I want to see what you can do,
how far along you are.

259
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:47,834
Now, come along and join the others.
Come on; let's go.

260
00:28:48,084 --> 00:28:50,586
Daniel?

261
00:28:50,586 --> 00:28:53,589
All together now.

262
00:28:56,592 --> 00:28:58,594
And one and two...

263
00:28:58,594 --> 00:29:01,597
And three and four.

264
00:29:03,099 --> 00:29:06,102
- I can't. Please.
- And one and two...

265
00:29:06,102 --> 00:29:08,104
And three and four.

266
00:29:08,604 --> 00:29:13,609
And one and two and three and four.

267
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,864
And one and two and three and four.

268
00:29:17,864 --> 00:29:22,118
Pay attention, Suzy. Get those legs
up higher. You're not paralyzed.

269
00:29:23,619 --> 00:29:28,541
Get those legs up higher.
And one and two and three and...

270
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:31,627
Pay attention, Suzy. And one and two...

271
00:29:31,627 --> 00:29:34,130
And three and four.

272
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:38,134
And one and two and three and four.

273
00:30:08,831 --> 00:30:11,334
Come on. Come on. Run along.

274
00:30:11,334 --> 00:30:13,836
Come on. Drink up.

275
00:30:13,836 --> 00:30:16,839
- Oh, you... You must drink.
- No, that's enough.

276
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:19,342
You heard what the doctor said.

277
00:30:19,342 --> 00:30:21,844
- Drink up.
- No.

278
00:30:21,844 --> 00:30:23,846
You must drink.

279
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:26,933
The blood that was hemorrhaging is
going back with the intake of liquids.

280
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:30,937
- Right, professor Verdegast?
- Obviously.

281
00:30:30,937 --> 00:30:33,439
My dear madame.

282
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:37,443
Do not be concerned. It's nothing,
as I've already told the young lady.

283
00:30:37,443 --> 00:30:40,446
That's a relief, professor.
How do you feel, dear?

284
00:30:40,446 --> 00:30:43,449
- Uh, better.
- The fault lies with your exercises.

285
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:48,955
When somebody's been out of practice,
violent movement could cause tiny
tears in internal ligaments.

286
00:30:48,955 --> 00:30:50,957
Thus the hemorrhaging.

287
00:30:51,457 --> 00:30:54,961
You look better already. You've
even got color back in your cheeks.

288
00:30:54,961 --> 00:30:56,963
- Isn't that right?
- Oh, yes. She looks much better.

289
00:30:57,463 --> 00:30:58,965
- Ow!
- Hold still.

290
00:30:59,465 --> 00:31:02,468
This will get you back into shape in no time.

291
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:08,474
Here we are. Fine, fine. A day or two,
you'll be on your feet, as good as new.

292
00:31:11,477 --> 00:31:15,481
- Who brought my bags here?
- Olga. What a dear.

293
00:31:15,481 --> 00:31:18,484
The minute she heard you were ill, she
went right home and brought your things.

294
00:31:18,985 --> 00:31:22,488
Oh, and she also left me your $50,
and she didn't take a penny of it.

295
00:31:22,488 --> 00:31:25,491
Why... Why did she do that?

296
00:31:25,491 --> 00:31:28,494
- If I wanted to, I would...
- Well, my dear,

297
00:31:28,494 --> 00:31:31,497
What you need now is
some peace and quiet.

298
00:31:31,497 --> 00:31:35,001
If the hemorrhaging should start
again, which is very improbable,

299
00:31:35,001 --> 00:31:37,503
You can telephone me.

300
00:31:37,503 --> 00:31:41,007
And Tanner, she is to eat
bland food for about a week.

301
00:31:41,507 --> 00:31:43,509
And you mustn't let
her have any fruit.

302
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:46,012
- A drop of vin rose?
- Yes.

303
00:31:46,012 --> 00:31:49,515
Good. A glass of red wine with
each meal. It works miracles.

304
00:31:49,515 --> 00:31:53,019
Clears up anemia and strengthens
red corpuscles. It builds the blood.

305
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,023
Rest well. You're in good hands.

306
00:32:20,797 --> 00:32:24,300
Suzy, we're next-door neighbors.

307
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,303
So, you moved in here.

308
00:32:27,303 --> 00:32:30,306
Well, they moved me in here.

309
00:32:30,306 --> 00:32:32,308
I really didn't want to.

310
00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:35,812
You know, as soon as I got sick,
your pal Olga ran and got my bags...

311
00:32:35,812 --> 00:32:37,814
And threw me out of her place.

312
00:32:37,814 --> 00:32:41,317
She must've thought I had
something awfully contagious.

313
00:32:42,819 --> 00:32:46,322
But I can't stand to live in a
boarding school like a ten-year-old.

314
00:32:46,322 --> 00:32:49,325
Oh, wow. You come back strong.

315
00:32:49,325 --> 00:32:51,828
Yeah, you know, I feel really well.

316
00:32:51,828 --> 00:32:55,331
I mean, it's almost as if nothing
had happened. It's incredible.

317
00:32:55,331 --> 00:32:58,835
- And all thanks to professor Verdegast.
- Verdegast?

318
00:32:58,835 --> 00:33:00,837
- He came to look at you?
- Yeah.

319
00:33:00,837 --> 00:33:03,339
Come in.

320
00:33:05,842 --> 00:33:07,844
Hi, Pavlos.

321
00:33:18,771 --> 00:33:20,773
Thank you.

322
00:33:22,775 --> 00:33:25,778
You'd better keep an eye on that
lighter. He really likes it.

323
00:33:25,778 --> 00:33:27,780
Yes, but I don't think he's a thief.

324
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,782
At least you know.

325
00:33:29,782 --> 00:33:33,786
- Are you eating up here?
- Yeah, they put me on a restricted diet.

326
00:33:33,786 --> 00:33:36,789
And on a restricted diet, they give you wine?

327
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:40,793
That's professor Verdegast's idea.
Says it'll build up my blood.

328
00:33:47,133 --> 00:33:50,136
The bell. Oh, god. That means
it's only 15 minutes till supper.

329
00:33:50,136 --> 00:33:52,638
I'd better change.

330
00:33:52,638 --> 00:33:55,641
- Ciao. See you later.
- Okay.

331
00:35:26,232 --> 00:35:28,234
Where? Where?

332
00:35:28,234 --> 00:35:30,236
Everywhere. The whole floor.

333
00:35:30,737 --> 00:35:33,239
It's disgusting! It's disgusting!

334
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:35,742
- Where are they coming from?
- I don't know! Let's go and see!

335
00:35:35,742 --> 00:35:39,245
- They're coming from the ceiling.
- In the meantime, everybody downstairs.

336
00:35:52,425 --> 00:35:54,427
Don't let anyone come up.

337
00:36:49,982 --> 00:36:53,986
I'm sorry. Truly mortified.
Please excuse me.

338
00:36:53,986 --> 00:36:55,988
But it was nothing to do
with you, madame.

339
00:36:55,988 --> 00:36:58,991
No, of course not, girls.
It was not madame Blanc's fault.

340
00:36:58,991 --> 00:37:01,744
We ordered those cases
of food by mail...

341
00:37:02,245 --> 00:37:04,247
From a reliable firm that
we thought to be honest.

342
00:37:04,664 --> 00:37:06,165
Obviously, It arrived spoiled.

343
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:08,668
In a few days' time,
you see what happened.

344
00:37:08,668 --> 00:37:11,421
- Oh, it was awful.
- Yes, one got in my mouth.

345
00:37:11,421 --> 00:37:15,425
I suppose we're fortunate those things
only reached the floor below the attic.

346
00:37:15,425 --> 00:37:18,428
- Are the other floors all right?
- Yes. We checked them out.

347
00:37:18,428 --> 00:37:20,430
Just the floor where the
students' rooms are.

348
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:23,433
Well, I'll take care of the problem
of fumigating in the morning.

349
00:37:23,433 --> 00:37:26,936
In the meantime, for tonight, I've
thought of a makeshift arrangement.

350
00:37:26,936 --> 00:37:29,439
Go and see how they're getting
along, will you, dear?

351
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,443
The boys have kindly offered to help,

352
00:37:33,443 --> 00:37:35,945
And they and the servants are turning
the practice hall into a dormitory.

353
00:37:36,446 --> 00:37:39,949
If some of you choose to find hotel
rooms, I'll have no objections.

354
00:37:39,949 --> 00:37:41,951
But it's already late,
and in any case,

355
00:37:41,951 --> 00:37:43,953
The inconvenience will only
be for one night.

356
00:37:43,953 --> 00:37:46,289
We'll all sleep together.

357
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,792
- Bravo.
- You all right?

358
00:37:49,792 --> 00:37:52,295
- Yes, thank you.
- Fine.

359
00:37:52,795 --> 00:37:54,797
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, thank you.

360
00:37:55,298 --> 00:37:56,799
- Good.
- Are you all right?

361
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,801
Yes, madame Blanc. Thank you.

362
00:37:59,302 --> 00:38:01,804
- Oh, it's very comfortable. Just like being in camp.
- Good.

363
00:38:02,305 --> 00:38:04,307
Are you sleeping here with
us, too, Madame Blanc?

364
00:38:04,807 --> 00:38:06,809
Certainly, as are all the other
teachers and miss Tanner.

365
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:09,812
Do the teachers live here at school?

366
00:38:09,812 --> 00:38:11,814
No, they live in town.

367
00:38:11,814 --> 00:38:15,318
They leave after supper at
9:30, just like clockwork.

368
00:38:15,485 --> 00:38:17,487
It's very late. You won't be afraid
if I turn out the lights?

369
00:38:17,987 --> 00:38:20,490
- Good night, everyone.
- Good night. Good night.

370
00:38:59,696 --> 00:39:02,198
Is that guy hot for you?

371
00:39:02,198 --> 00:39:04,158
- Maybe.
- That's funny.

372
00:39:04,784 --> 00:39:07,078
I heard he was, uh...

373
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:12,625
- Of course, I'm not much of a gossip.
- That's a good one.

374
00:39:13,209 --> 00:39:15,211
Come on. You tried to get
him and didn't make it.

375
00:39:15,211 --> 00:39:17,171
- You liar! That's not...
- Why don't you two shut up?

376
00:39:17,171 --> 00:39:19,716
Some of us want to go to sleep.

377
00:39:24,721 --> 00:39:28,224
Hey, Sara. Forget it. It's okay.

378
00:40:49,472 --> 00:40:51,641
Suzy, are you asleep?

379
00:40:51,808 --> 00:40:54,394
- Were you sleeping?
- No. What's the matter?

380
00:40:56,396 --> 00:40:58,523
You hear that snoring?

381
00:40:58,523 --> 00:41:01,401
It's weird.

382
00:41:01,401 --> 00:41:04,278
Hear it?

383
00:41:04,278 --> 00:41:06,656
Where do you think it's coming from?

384
00:41:12,995 --> 00:41:16,332
Behind the sheet.

385
00:41:16,332 --> 00:41:18,835
Lies!

386
00:41:18,835 --> 00:41:20,920
What?

387
00:41:24,424 --> 00:41:26,426
They lied to us.

388
00:41:26,426 --> 00:41:28,928
The directress is here.

389
00:41:28,928 --> 00:41:32,432
That's her, the one who's snoring.

390
00:41:32,432 --> 00:41:34,934
She's the directress.

391
00:41:34,934 --> 00:41:37,395
- How do you know?
- I'm sure it's her.

392
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:42,734
Last year, for a while,

393
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:44,861
I lived in one of the guest rooms...

394
00:41:44,861 --> 00:41:47,030
Under the top of the stairs.

395
00:41:50,533 --> 00:41:52,535
One night,

396
00:41:52,535 --> 00:41:56,289
I heard someone coming very late in,

397
00:41:56,289 --> 00:41:59,459
Getting into bed in the room next to mine.

398
00:42:00,543 --> 00:42:02,628
And then...

399
00:42:02,628 --> 00:42:06,215
Then I heard this weird kind of snoring.

400
00:42:06,215 --> 00:42:09,802
I tell you, it was so weird
I never forgot it.

401
00:42:12,388 --> 00:42:14,807
Listen.

402
00:42:15,308 --> 00:42:17,393
You hear that whistle?

403
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:21,564
It's exactly the same.

404
00:42:21,981 --> 00:42:25,568
The next morning, madame Blanc told me...

405
00:42:25,568 --> 00:42:28,071
That the directress had spent
a few hours at the school...

406
00:42:28,071 --> 00:42:31,074
And had slept in the room next to mine.

407
00:42:33,701 --> 00:42:35,244
You see?

408
00:42:35,745 --> 00:42:39,332
So I know she's the directress.

409
00:42:39,332 --> 00:42:41,334
She's here.

410
00:42:44,504 --> 00:42:46,506
She's there.

411
00:42:46,506 --> 00:42:49,592
Right behind that sheet.

412
00:43:11,864 --> 00:43:14,867
Thank you. I'm grateful you can take
care of the fumigating so promptly.

413
00:43:14,867 --> 00:43:17,870
- Good morning, madame Blanc.
- Good morning, Daniel.

414
00:43:18,371 --> 00:43:21,374
- Is everything in order now?
- All cleaned up, madame.

415
00:43:21,374 --> 00:43:23,876
Just to be sure, we checked
the other floors too.

416
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,882
Miss Tanner. Excuse me.

417
00:43:29,882 --> 00:43:31,884
Did the directress sleep
here last night?

418
00:43:31,884 --> 00:43:34,887
- No, she didn't. Good morning, Daniel.
- Good morning.

419
00:43:35,388 --> 00:43:39,392
You know she's away on a trip. Maybe
she'll pay us a visit two weeks from now.

420
00:43:39,392 --> 00:43:42,895
Excuse me, miss Tanner, But which
class do I attend this morning?

421
00:43:42,895 --> 00:43:44,897
The second-year class in the red room.

422
00:43:44,897 --> 00:43:46,899
Thank you.

423
00:44:45,708 --> 00:44:48,211
Stop!

424
00:44:48,211 --> 00:44:51,214
Stop! Stop!

425
00:44:51,214 --> 00:44:54,217
Enough. Enough!

426
00:44:54,217 --> 00:44:57,220
- Do you know what happened? Do you know?
- What day is it?

427
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:00,723
Your lousy, disgusting
dog has bitten Albert!

428
00:45:00,723 --> 00:45:02,725
He took a piece out
of Albert's arm.

429
00:45:03,226 --> 00:45:05,728
- What?
- Did you all hear that?

430
00:45:05,728 --> 00:45:08,731
That miserable dog tried
to mutilate a child.

431
00:45:08,731 --> 00:45:12,735
Madame Blanc had to rush Albert to
a first-aid center to have stitches put in!

432
00:45:12,735 --> 00:45:16,239
- That's impossible.
- Let's go to the first-aid center.

433
00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:19,742
Even if you can't see the blood, at least
you can hear the poor child's crying.

434
00:45:19,742 --> 00:45:21,744
That's enough now!

435
00:45:22,245 --> 00:45:25,748
My dog's a peaceful, faithful
animal. He's never hurt anyone.

436
00:45:25,748 --> 00:45:28,251
The boy must have done
something to him first!

437
00:45:28,251 --> 00:45:31,754
Oh, the poor little animal!
The poor little puppy!

438
00:45:31,754 --> 00:45:36,259
If I ever see him within a mile of this
school again, I'll have him put to death!

439
00:45:36,259 --> 00:45:38,261
Stop it!

440
00:45:38,261 --> 00:45:40,263
I won't allow such talk, you understand?

441
00:45:40,263 --> 00:45:43,266
You won't allow it?

442
00:45:43,266 --> 00:45:45,768
Then get out! You and your dog!

443
00:45:46,269 --> 00:45:49,272
- Get moving!
- You bitch!

444
00:45:49,272 --> 00:45:51,274
Out!

445
00:45:51,274 --> 00:45:54,277
I'm going. I'm going.

446
00:45:54,277 --> 00:45:56,779
But try to understand that...

447
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,783
That I'm blind, not deaf.

448
00:46:01,284 --> 00:46:03,286
Get it? Huh?

449
00:46:03,286 --> 00:46:05,288
Not deaf.

450
00:46:05,538 --> 00:46:08,041
Not deaf. You understand that?

451
00:46:08,041 --> 00:46:10,043
You understand?

452
00:46:12,545 --> 00:46:15,548
Ahh, fresh air!

453
00:46:15,548 --> 00:46:18,051
Let me out of this gilded parade.

454
00:46:18,551 --> 00:46:22,555
Get out! Get out of here! Good riddance!

455
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:30,063
Oh, Pavlos, how much longer
do I have to eat like this?

456
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:56,673
Hey, listen.

457
00:46:56,673 --> 00:47:00,677
There they go, right on schedule.

458
00:47:00,677 --> 00:47:03,179
The teachers. Remember?

459
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:08,184
Can you hear them?
They're going away.

460
00:47:12,188 --> 00:47:14,190
You hear them?

461
00:47:16,192 --> 00:47:18,194
Yes.

462
00:47:22,865 --> 00:47:24,867
I...

463
00:47:34,877 --> 00:47:38,381
l... I don't think they'll
even miss school.

464
00:47:38,381 --> 00:47:41,384
What? What did you say?

465
00:47:41,384 --> 00:47:43,886
Wake up.

466
00:47:43,886 --> 00:47:48,391
I said, it doesn't seem to
me that they're going out.

467
00:47:49,892 --> 00:47:52,395
A front door is on the left.

468
00:47:53,896 --> 00:47:57,400
Their footsteps are going to the
right, somewhere inside the school.

469
00:47:58,901 --> 00:48:01,904
Jesus, Suzy.

470
00:48:01,904 --> 00:48:02,905
- You're a genius.
- Mmm.

471
00:48:04,407 --> 00:48:06,409
Fantastic.

472
00:48:06,409 --> 00:48:09,829
How come I never noticed that before?

473
00:48:09,829 --> 00:48:14,834
Suzy. If they don't leave,
Where do they go?

474
00:48:15,334 --> 00:48:17,336
Wake up. Suzy.

475
00:48:17,336 --> 00:48:22,175
Come on. Wake up. Suzy!

476
00:48:23,676 --> 00:48:26,179
I'm so sleepy.

477
00:48:26,179 --> 00:48:28,181
I don't know why. I'm sorry.

478
00:48:28,181 --> 00:48:31,184
Maybe...

479
00:48:31,184 --> 00:48:33,686
Maybe we can find out where they really go.

480
00:48:35,188 --> 00:48:39,692
Of course!
Yes.

481
00:48:43,196 --> 00:48:46,199
Begin to count the steps as they go.

482
00:49:03,049 --> 00:49:05,468
It's like the search of alietne.

483
00:52:31,758 --> 00:52:33,843
Easy.

484
00:52:35,345 --> 00:52:37,347
What is it? Huh?

485
00:52:37,347 --> 00:52:39,349
Come on.

486
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:42,852
Come on; let's go home.

487
00:53:05,625 --> 00:53:08,127
Who is that? Who's there?

488
00:53:09,629 --> 00:53:11,798
Easy, boy.

489
00:53:17,303 --> 00:53:19,305
What is it?

490
00:53:21,808 --> 00:53:23,893
What's happening?

491
00:53:28,564 --> 00:53:31,025
Who's there?

492
00:53:35,488 --> 00:53:37,990
Who's there?

493
00:53:52,171 --> 00:53:54,173
Wait!

494
00:55:50,456 --> 00:55:53,543
Poor Daniel. Torn to pieces. Incredible.

495
00:55:53,543 --> 00:55:56,546
Oh, yeah, but you can never put
too much trust in wolfhounds.

496
00:55:56,546 --> 00:56:00,049
They're crazy. We had two of them
once at the villa in Gestaad.

497
00:56:00,049 --> 00:56:03,052
My god. First Pat gets
murdered by a madman,

498
00:56:03,052 --> 00:56:05,555
And now Daniel is killed by his dog.

499
00:56:05,555 --> 00:56:08,057
Yeah. Maybe there's a hex on the place.

500
00:56:08,558 --> 00:56:12,562
Yeah. Let's call in the exorcist
and have it purged.

501
00:56:13,062 --> 00:56:17,066
- What is it? Is something wrong?
- No, everything's all right.

502
00:56:17,316 --> 00:56:19,819
Is it something personal, dear?

503
00:56:19,819 --> 00:56:22,321
No, no, it's nothing like that.

504
00:56:23,823 --> 00:56:26,325
Miss Tanner, would you mind?

505
00:56:26,492 --> 00:56:28,494
I'd like a few minutes
alone with Suzy.

506
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,002
Well? What is it?

507
00:56:36,502 --> 00:56:40,006
I just wanted to talk to you about some of
the things that have been happening lately.

508
00:56:40,506 --> 00:56:43,509
Oh, I know you're upset by Daniel's
death, as we all have been.

509
00:56:43,509 --> 00:56:45,511
No, but it's more than that.

510
00:56:46,012 --> 00:56:48,514
Does anybody know anything
about who killed Pat?

511
00:56:49,015 --> 00:56:50,516
I spoke with the chief of
police just this morning.

512
00:56:51,017 --> 00:56:53,019
He told me they had
some definite clues.

513
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:56,522
- You know that I saw her the night I arrived here.
- Yes, you told me that.

514
00:56:56,522 --> 00:56:59,984
And that she was mumbling some
strange, unrelated words.

515
00:57:00,526 --> 00:57:02,987
No, you didn't tell me that.

516
00:57:02,987 --> 00:57:06,532
Because it was something that didn't
make any sense. It was in a thunderstorm.

517
00:57:06,532 --> 00:57:09,535
I just didn't pay much attention to it.

518
00:57:09,535 --> 00:57:12,538
I only caught two words distinctly:

519
00:57:12,538 --> 00:57:14,999
"Secret" and "Irises."

520
00:57:14,999 --> 00:57:18,544
I don't know what they mean, but
I thought they might be important.

521
00:57:18,544 --> 00:57:20,546
You've done very well. Congratulations.

522
00:57:20,546 --> 00:57:23,549
I don't know what the words
"Secret" or "Irises" mean either.

523
00:57:23,549 --> 00:57:26,010
But I think it's only right we should
let the police know about it.

524
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:30,515
I'm only amazed you waited
two days before... hello?

525
00:57:30,723 --> 00:57:34,310
- You really messed things up.
- What are you talking about?

526
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:37,313
Because... Maybe Pat was talking to...

527
00:57:37,814 --> 00:57:40,316
Someone just inside the building that night.

528
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,823
And we know that someone
wasn't one of the teachers.

529
00:57:53,579 --> 00:57:55,581
Come on.

530
00:57:58,084 --> 00:58:00,586
Now you've put them
on the hunt for somebody.

531
00:58:00,586 --> 00:58:03,589
What difference does that make to you?

532
00:58:03,589 --> 00:58:05,591
Big difference.

533
00:58:06,592 --> 00:58:09,595
Because I was Pat's friend.

534
00:58:10,096 --> 00:58:12,598
She was telling me something
When you suddenly showed up.

535
00:58:12,598 --> 00:58:16,102
She got scared and she ran away.

536
00:58:16,102 --> 00:58:18,604
She was in hysterics almost.

537
00:58:19,105 --> 00:58:21,107
And then she was killed.

538
00:58:21,107 --> 00:58:24,610
Remember that voice when you rang the bell?

539
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:27,113
Well, that was me.

540
00:59:23,169 --> 00:59:27,173
I heard strange, incredible, absurd things.

541
00:59:27,173 --> 00:59:29,676
Pat was taking notes on them for months.

542
00:59:29,676 --> 00:59:33,179
And before going away,
she gave me all the notes.

543
00:59:33,179 --> 00:59:36,683
I've only told one person,
a very good friend of mine.

544
00:59:36,683 --> 00:59:39,686
Frank Mandel. He's here
for a convention.

545
00:59:40,186 --> 00:59:43,189
I'll let you read them tonight.

546
00:59:53,866 --> 00:59:57,870
Suzy, wake up. Please. Wake up.

547
00:59:57,870 --> 01:00:01,332
The notes are gone! Someone
stole them from me!

548
01:00:01,708 --> 01:00:05,128
You understand? They disappeared.

549
01:00:05,128 --> 01:00:09,966
Don't fall asleep! Please help me!

550
01:00:10,216 --> 01:00:13,219
- Wake up! Help me!
- I can't.

551
01:00:13,469 --> 01:00:14,971
Can't?

552
01:00:17,473 --> 01:00:22,478
This is the only thing I got left,
and that's because I kept it on me. Look.

553
01:00:22,478 --> 01:00:24,981
- Look.
- What is it?

554
01:00:24,981 --> 01:00:29,485
What's the matter with you? Don't
you remember? What's going on?

555
01:00:29,736 --> 01:00:33,740
This is the key that'll get us
wherever the teachers go every night.

556
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:37,744
I thought it out yesterday evening
while I was sitting here next to you.

557
01:00:37,744 --> 01:00:43,458
Suzy, do you know
anything about witches?

558
01:00:49,005 --> 01:00:52,008
Oh, no! Please!

559
01:00:53,468 --> 01:00:57,013
Don't leave me alone!

560
01:01:08,983 --> 01:01:11,986
I must get away!

561
01:03:08,311 --> 01:03:11,773
Wait!

562
01:03:32,001 --> 01:03:35,004
Wait!

563
01:04:07,412 --> 01:04:09,956
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

564
01:09:02,832 --> 01:09:05,710
Looking for Sara? She's disappeared.

565
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:08,713
But that's impossible. I just
talked to her last night.

566
01:09:08,713 --> 01:09:12,717
She left this morning, as a matter
of fact, without telling anyone.

567
01:09:12,717 --> 01:09:16,220
Just packed her bags and left. She
was heard leaving about 6:00.

568
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:19,724
- You heard her leave, didn't you?
- Sara? Oh, yes.

569
01:09:19,724 --> 01:09:23,227
I heard the door close and her
footsteps going down the hall.

570
01:09:23,227 --> 01:09:27,231
And then I heard a car driving off down the
street. I guess someone was waiting for her.

571
01:09:27,231 --> 01:09:32,236
- But it's impossible.
- If she wasn't happy here, she could've told someone.

572
01:09:32,737 --> 01:09:35,239
Why sneak off like a thief?

573
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:49,504
Hello. May I speak to Frank
Mandel, please? Yes, thank you.

574
01:09:51,005 --> 01:09:54,008
Hello. This is Suzy Bannion.

575
01:09:54,008 --> 01:09:57,011
No, we've never met. I'm a
friend of Sara's.

576
01:09:57,011 --> 01:10:01,516
Yes. Hello. Do you happen to
know where Sara is?

577
01:10:03,017 --> 01:10:06,020
Well, she disappeared from
school this morning.

578
01:10:06,521 --> 01:10:09,524
Yes, it seems she left and
took all her luggage.

579
01:10:09,524 --> 01:10:14,028
Yes. Uh, listen, could I see
you sometime today?

580
01:10:15,029 --> 01:10:18,032
Well, I'm really worried about her.

581
01:10:18,032 --> 01:10:22,537
Oh, great. Where?

582
01:10:22,537 --> 01:10:26,040
At the convention center.
Okay. I'll see you there.

583
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:29,544
She didn't inform any of her classmates.
I've already asked all of them.

584
01:10:29,544 --> 01:10:33,047
It's very upsetting. I can't
understand why she did it.

585
01:10:33,548 --> 01:10:36,050
I'm the one who's held responsible
by their families.

586
01:10:36,050 --> 01:10:39,679
I'll call her father in Geneva.
Perhaps she might have gone there.

587
01:10:52,692 --> 01:10:56,696
I've already phoned Sara's father.
He's the Italian consul in Geneva.

588
01:10:56,696 --> 01:11:01,200
But he wasn't there today.
He was away for the weekend.

589
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:05,204
They said he'd be back by monday, and
they don't know anything about her there.

590
01:11:05,204 --> 01:11:08,207
Well, do you understand
Why I'm so worried?

591
01:11:08,207 --> 01:11:12,712
Yes, but before we both get upset,
let's wait for the father's return.

592
01:11:12,712 --> 01:11:16,215
Maybe they got together this morning
and went off on their own.

593
01:11:16,215 --> 01:11:22,221
I know her quite well. She was a
patient of mine three years ago.

594
01:11:22,221 --> 01:11:26,225
- Were you aware of that?
- No. I didn't even know you were a psychiatrist.

595
01:11:26,225 --> 01:11:30,730
Well, she had a nervous breakdown
after her mother's death,

596
01:11:31,230 --> 01:11:33,232
And she came to me for treatment.

597
01:11:33,733 --> 01:11:37,236
After she got better again,
we remained friends,

598
01:11:37,236 --> 01:11:42,241
But lately she was upset about some notions
put into her head by a friend of hers.

599
01:11:42,241 --> 01:11:45,244
- Not you, I hope?
- No.

600
01:11:45,495 --> 01:11:47,997
They were kind of wild ideas.

601
01:11:47,997 --> 01:11:52,502
She had discovered that the
Tam academy was founded...

602
01:11:52,627 --> 01:11:57,131
In 1895 by a certain Helena Markos,
A Greek immigrant,

603
01:11:57,131 --> 01:12:00,635
And that the local people
believed her to be a witch.

604
01:12:02,136 --> 01:12:06,140
- I guess you knew that?
- No. But I have a strange feeling...

605
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:11,646
That somebody already told me
about it... Or something similar.

606
01:12:11,646 --> 01:12:13,648
I can't... can't remember.

607
01:12:13,648 --> 01:12:17,652
Well, that really got Sara's imagination
going. Earlier in the 19th century,

608
01:12:18,027 --> 01:12:22,532
The Markos woman had been expelled
from several european countries.

609
01:12:22,532 --> 01:12:28,037
She seemed to have something about her
which urged religious people to persecute her.

610
01:12:28,538 --> 01:12:33,042
She also wrote a number of books, and
I read that among the initiated,

611
01:12:33,543 --> 01:12:36,671
She went by the name "The Black Queen."

612
01:12:36,671 --> 01:12:40,675
After she settled down here, she became
the subject of a lot of gossip.

613
01:12:40,675 --> 01:12:44,679
Nevertheless, she managed to put
her hands on a great deal of money,

614
01:12:44,679 --> 01:12:47,181
And she founded the Tam academy...

615
01:12:47,181 --> 01:12:52,311
At first a sort of school of
dance and occult sciences.

616
01:12:52,311 --> 01:12:55,314
But that didn't last long,
because in 1905,

617
01:12:55,314 --> 01:12:58,317
After being hounded and
cursed at for ten years,

618
01:12:58,317 --> 01:13:01,821
Madame Markos died in a fire.

619
01:13:01,821 --> 01:13:05,324
That's all there is, as far
as witchcraft is concerned.

620
01:13:05,324 --> 01:13:10,455
The school was taken over by her favorite
pupil. The study of the occult was abandoned.

621
01:13:10,455 --> 01:13:14,959
And soon the place became
the famous dance academy.

622
01:13:14,959 --> 01:13:19,964
But what does it mean to be a witch?

623
01:13:20,214 --> 01:13:23,593
Well, as a believer in the material
world and a psychiatrist to boot,

624
01:13:23,593 --> 01:13:28,097
I'm convinced that the current spread
of belief in magic and the occult...

625
01:13:28,097 --> 01:13:31,601
Is part of mental illness.

626
01:13:31,601 --> 01:13:37,106
Bad luck isn't brought by broken
mirrors, but by broken minds.

627
01:13:38,608 --> 01:13:41,069
Excuse me. Milius?

628
01:13:41,152 --> 01:13:43,654
Professor Milius can answer your
question better than I can.

629
01:13:44,155 --> 01:13:47,158
He wrote a book called paranoia
or magic, and believe me,

630
01:13:47,158 --> 01:13:49,160
It's the final word on the subject.

631
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:53,665
Excuse me, Milius. If you don't mind,
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.

632
01:13:53,665 --> 01:13:57,669
- Fraulein.
- She's interested in your favorite subject:

633
01:13:57,669 --> 01:14:00,171
Witches.

634
01:14:00,171 --> 01:14:03,675
Can you tell her something
about the mysterious?

635
01:14:05,176 --> 01:14:08,179
Well, I have to go. I have an
appointment to keep.

636
01:14:08,179 --> 01:14:10,682
Keep me posted, Hmm?

637
01:14:10,682 --> 01:14:13,184
Hello. I'm sorry to bother you.

638
01:14:13,184 --> 01:14:17,689
Ah, so, what would you like to know?

639
01:14:17,689 --> 01:14:21,192
- Do you believe in the existence of witches?
- Ah.

640
01:14:21,192 --> 01:14:25,196
I have known some women who
are said to be witches.

641
01:14:25,196 --> 01:14:28,700
- Really?
- I have studied the phenomenon for a long time.

642
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:31,202
I am of the opinion that
it is an important appendage...

643
01:14:31,703 --> 01:14:34,706
Of contemporary psychiatry.

644
01:14:34,706 --> 01:14:36,708
You're skeptical, my dear.

645
01:14:36,708 --> 01:14:40,211
Well, frankly, it is a little
hard to believe.

646
01:14:42,213 --> 01:14:47,343
- What do witches do?
- They are malefic, negative and destructive.

647
01:14:47,343 --> 01:14:51,848
Their knowledge of the art of the occult
gives them tremendous powers.

648
01:14:52,348 --> 01:14:57,353
They can change the course of events and
people's lives, but only to do harm.

649
01:14:58,354 --> 01:15:01,858
- You don't believe me?
- No, I...

650
01:15:01,858 --> 01:15:05,361
Their goal is to accumulate
great personal wealth,

651
01:15:05,361 --> 01:15:09,365
But that can only be achieved
by injury to others.

652
01:15:09,365 --> 01:15:12,869
They can cause suffering,
sickness and even the death...

653
01:15:12,869 --> 01:15:16,873
Of those who, for whatever
reason, have offended them.

654
01:15:19,125 --> 01:15:22,378
Why do you have all this
interest in the occult?

655
01:15:22,378 --> 01:15:25,381
Because some friends spoke
to me about witches.

656
01:15:25,381 --> 01:15:28,384
I read some stuff.

657
01:15:28,384 --> 01:15:31,387
Have you ever heard of Helena Markos?

658
01:15:31,888 --> 01:15:34,891
Oh, yes. She was a very
famous black queen.

659
01:15:34,891 --> 01:15:37,894
A powerful witch with a tremendous
talent for doing evil,

660
01:15:37,894 --> 01:15:39,896
A real mistress of magic.

661
01:15:40,271 --> 01:15:43,274
She lived and died in the city.
Did you know that?

662
01:15:43,775 --> 01:15:48,279
Yes. And might there exist
a guild of witches?

663
01:15:48,279 --> 01:15:51,282
The correct term would
be a coven of witches.

664
01:15:51,282 --> 01:15:54,285
A woman becomes queen of her magic
is a hundred times more powerful...

665
01:15:54,786 --> 01:15:57,288
Than the rest of the coven,
which is like a serpent.

666
01:15:57,288 --> 01:16:01,292
Its strength rests with its leader...
That is, with its head.

667
01:16:01,292 --> 01:16:05,296
A coven deprived of its leader
is like a headless cobra:

668
01:16:05,296 --> 01:16:07,799
Harmless.

669
01:16:08,299 --> 01:16:11,803
Skepticism is the natural
reaction of people nowadays,

670
01:16:11,803 --> 01:16:14,806
But magic is ever present.

671
01:16:14,906 --> 01:16:16,385
In other words:

672
01:16:16,485 --> 01:16:19,835
"Quoddam ubique, quoddam semper,

673
01:16:19,935 --> 01:16:23,285
quoddam ab omnibus creditum est."

674
01:16:23,690 --> 01:16:26,192
Which means that magic is everywhere,

675
01:16:26,693 --> 01:16:29,696
And all over the world,
it's a recognized fact.

676
01:16:29,696 --> 01:16:32,165
Always.

677
01:16:46,838 --> 01:16:49,841
Mark? Mark?

678
01:16:58,349 --> 01:17:01,853
Excuse me. Where is everybody?

679
01:17:01,853 --> 01:17:06,357
They have all gone to the theater
for the opening of the Bolshoi.

680
01:17:06,357 --> 01:17:09,360
- Then why didn't anyone tell me about it?
- I don't know.

681
01:17:09,861 --> 01:17:13,364
Miss Tanner obtained
tickets for everyone.

682
01:17:17,869 --> 01:17:22,373
- Frank, this is Suzy. Sara's friend?
- Suzy? Hello?

683
01:17:22,373 --> 01:17:24,876
- I can't...
- Talk louder. I can't hear you very well.

684
01:17:24,876 --> 01:17:28,379
- Did something happen?
- Well, I haven't heard from Sara,

685
01:17:28,379 --> 01:17:31,382
But a lot of strange
things are happening.

686
01:17:31,382 --> 01:17:34,761
I mean, for example,
when I eat at night, I...

687
01:17:35,261 --> 01:17:38,014
Hello? Hello, Frank?

688
01:17:38,598 --> 01:17:41,476
Hello? Can you hear me?

689
01:17:41,476 --> 01:17:44,395
Frank? Hello?

690
01:17:44,395 --> 01:17:47,732
Hello? Hello?

691
01:17:47,732 --> 01:17:49,734
Hello?

692
01:17:51,235 --> 01:17:54,739
Hello, Frank, can you hear me?

693
01:19:25,330 --> 01:19:28,333
No!

694
01:19:32,337 --> 01:19:35,340
No!

695
01:21:16,858 --> 01:21:20,361
They don't leave the school at all.

696
01:21:20,361 --> 01:21:25,325
The front door is on the left. Their
footsteps are going to the right.

697
01:21:53,353 --> 01:21:58,358
Two, three, four, five, six,

698
01:21:58,358 --> 01:22:01,319
Seven...

699
01:22:03,821 --> 01:22:08,826
I can find out where they're
going by counting their footsteps.

700
01:23:21,399 --> 01:23:23,401
Twenty.

701
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:37,141
Who's there?

702
01:25:19,517 --> 01:25:23,354
Carpet. That's why the
footsteps stop here.

703
01:25:41,789 --> 01:25:45,293
It's impossible. There's gotta
be another way out of here.

704
01:26:53,903 --> 01:26:56,656
The secret...
I saw it behind the door!

705
01:26:56,656 --> 01:27:00,034
Three Irises!
Turn the blue one!

706
01:27:01,411 --> 01:27:04,414
The secret...
I saw it behind the door!

707
01:27:04,414 --> 01:27:07,166
Three Irises!
Turn the blue one!

708
01:29:58,921 --> 01:30:02,925
I told you: We must get rid of that
bitch of an american girl!

709
01:30:02,925 --> 01:30:08,306
Vanish... She must vanish! Make
her disappear, understand?

710
01:30:11,809 --> 01:30:14,812
She won't eat or drink
anything this evening.

711
01:30:21,819 --> 01:30:25,323
Vanish... She must vanish!

712
01:30:25,448 --> 01:30:28,451
She must die, die, die!

713
01:30:36,209 --> 01:30:38,711
Helena, give me power.

714
01:30:52,725 --> 01:30:55,728
Sickness! Sickness!

715
01:30:56,229 --> 01:30:58,731
Away with her! Away with trouble!

716
01:30:58,731 --> 01:31:03,736
Death, death, death!

717
01:33:03,085 --> 01:33:05,496
Who is it? Who's there?

718
01:33:07,721 --> 01:33:11,225
I've been expecting you.
The American girl.

719
01:33:11,897 --> 01:33:13,976
I knew you'd come.

720
01:33:14,988 --> 01:33:18,492
You wanna kill me?
You wanna kill me Helena Markos?

721
01:33:33,155 --> 01:33:35,531
You wanted to kill me!
You wanted to kill me!

722
01:33:37,415 --> 01:33:39,126
What are you gonna do now?

723
01:33:46,011 --> 01:33:47,757
Now death is coming for you!

724
01:33:50,731 --> 01:33:54,069
You wanted to kill Helena Markos?

725
01:33:56,954 --> 01:33:59,959
Hell is behind that door.

726
01:34:00,587 --> 01:34:03,212
You're going to meet death now!

727
01:34:04,513 --> 01:34:06,674
The living dead!

728
01:37:29,914 --> 01:37:32,917
Witch, witch.
