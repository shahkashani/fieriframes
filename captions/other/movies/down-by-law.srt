I'm completely finished with you.

57
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:21,906
Why don't you just go find yourself
some other little girl to be your pet?

58
00:06:21,907 --> 00:06:23,950
That shouldn't be too difficult for you.

59
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:27,828
I've had it with you
and your fuckin' stupid radio shows.

60
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:30,665
This is really fuckin' boring!

61
00:06:45,263 --> 00:06:48,391
Okay. Okay.

62
00:06:48,392 --> 00:06:51,197
We're not gonna talk about that right now.

63
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:02,124
Look at you, Zack.
Look what you're doing to yourself.

64
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,755
You're digging your own grave.

65
00:07:08,912 --> 00:07:12,153
Why can't you just
stay at one station a while?

66
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:18,474
Why do you always gotta go
fuck up your own future, huh?

67
00:07:22,426 --> 00:07:25,761
What are you so afraid of, Zack?

68
00:07:25,762 --> 00:07:30,224
Yeah, well, that's right, Laurette.
We can't live in the present forever.

69
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,631
Shit.

70
00:07:36,231 --> 00:07:39,423
Okay, look, um...

71
00:07:47,826 --> 00:07:52,626
Maybe you should just go back
to New York or Detroit or Baltimore.

72
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:56,313
You said you liked it there, remember?

73
00:07:58,587 --> 00:08:00,963
Go back to one of them stations
where you used to work...

74
00:08:00,964 --> 00:08:03,866
and ask them to give you a second chance.

75
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:09,206
There's nothing wrong
with asking somebody for somethin'.

76
00:08:09,806 --> 00:08:12,998
Why is that always so fuckin' hard for you?

77
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:19,981
You're a good deejay, Zack.

78
00:08:21,276 --> 00:08:24,487
All you got to do is learn
to jerk people off a little.

79
00:08:24,488 --> 00:08:27,050
That's all they really want, you know.

80
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:34,205
Well, I never jerk people off,
and you fuckin' know it, Laurette.

81
00:08:34,206 --> 00:08:37,640
Okay. Okay, fine. Forget it.

82
00:08:39,503 --> 00:08:42,004
I'm not talkin' to you anymore, Zack. Okay?

83
00:08:42,005 --> 00:08:44,006
I'm not talkin' to you anymore...

84
00:08:44,007 --> 00:08:46,008
because you don't want to fuckin' be here.

85
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:49,104
And I'm not gonna let you
play with me anymore!

86
00:08:56,686 --> 00:08:59,897
I hate you.
You're so damn stubborn and stupid.

87
00:08:59,898 --> 00:09:01,941
And I hate you. I hate you.

88
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:03,943
And I'm an idiot for being with you.

89
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:06,651
You got me embarrassed on my own time.

90
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:12,493
You got no fuckin' future, Zack,
especially not with me.

91
00:09:12,494 --> 00:09:14,495
Not the shoes. Not the shoes.

92
00:09:14,496 --> 00:09:17,123
- Not the shoes.
- No?

93
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:21,864
Come on, hit me, motherfucker!
Hit me! Hit me!

94
00:09:30,846 --> 00:09:33,506
I guess it's over between us, Laurette.

95
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,711
You know, Jack, we could
get some money together.

96
00:12:08,712 --> 00:12:11,338
Except you always blowin' it.

97
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:15,384
You know, gamblin',
gettin' high, showin' off.

98
00:12:15,385 --> 00:12:17,706
I have to have fun, you know, baby?

99
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:20,959
Yeah, yeah, I know.

100
00:12:21,391 --> 00:12:24,310
You always makin'
big, big plans for tomorrow.

101
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:26,438
You wanna know why?

102
00:12:26,938 --> 00:12:29,404
'Cause you always fuckin' up today.

103
00:12:30,734 --> 00:12:34,403
Look at what happened to that white girl
Julie that you started out with.

104
00:12:34,404 --> 00:12:36,864
She is a mess now.

105
00:12:36,865 --> 00:12:41,368
All the girls you got
are so messed up, except me.

106
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:46,081
I could tell you a lot of things about
yourself you never even thought about.

107
00:12:46,082 --> 00:12:48,742
Never even entered
your hatchet-shaped head.

108
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:52,246
But, you know, you never can be too sure.

109
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:58,122
My mama used to say that
America is a big meltin' pot.

110
00:12:58,303 --> 00:13:01,055
Because she used to say
when you bring it to a boil...

111
00:13:01,056 --> 00:13:05,856
all the scum rises to the top.

112
00:13:06,102 --> 00:13:10,745
So maybe there's hope for you yet, Jack.

113
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:14,792
You listenin' to me?

114
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:20,574
Shit. You don't understand
any kind of people.

115
00:13:20,575 --> 00:13:25,120
Maybe that's your problem.
You sure don't understand women at all.

116
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:28,797
And a pimp is at least
supposed to understand women.

117
00:13:31,127 --> 00:13:35,927
If you was a good pimp, you would have
hit me by now or done somethin'.

118
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,177
But I can just lay here and talk forever...

119
00:13:40,178 --> 00:13:42,638
and you won't hear a single word...

120
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,540
like you don't even speak English.

121
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:48,977
Lost inside all them plans you got.

122
00:13:48,978 --> 00:13:51,939
But I know about you, Jack.

123
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,733
Jack.

124
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:57,345
You sure can talk, can't you, baby?

125
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:09,665
- Yes?
- Hey, Jack. It's me, Gig.

126
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:12,209
Ah, what do you want?
Man, I don't owe you anything.

127
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:15,254
Man, I got something I know
you gonna be interested in, Jack.

128
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:17,172
I doubt that very much.

129
00:14:17,173 --> 00:14:18,757
- You busy?
- Yes.

130
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:21,343
- I just want to come up and
talk to you, Jack. - Uh-huh.

131
00:14:21,344 --> 00:14:24,680
- I wanna prove to you that
I'm on your side, man. - Uh-huh.

132
00:14:24,681 --> 00:14:28,142
- Don't you got just five minutes
to talk? - No, I don't.

133
00:14:28,143 --> 00:14:31,395
- Come on, Jack. - Just come up
and make it short, all right?

134
00:14:31,396 --> 00:14:33,717
- I'm on my way up.
- Yeah.

135
00:14:37,861 --> 00:14:40,327
Fatso's on his way up here.

136
00:14:45,034 --> 00:14:48,130
Cover up the merchandise.

137
00:14:49,247 --> 00:14:52,729
Just take this, in case he's gotten
any smarter lately, all right?

138
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:53,338
Hi, Jack. Where you at?

139
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,181
Hi, babe.

140
00:16:01,402 --> 00:16:03,723
She nice.

141
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:07,991
Jack, I know how you feel about me...

142
00:16:07,992 --> 00:16:10,536
after what happened
down in Jefferson Parish...

143
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:13,872
with that spy boy,
and I don't blame you one bit.

144
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:16,583
But you too serious.

145
00:16:16,584 --> 00:16:20,356
You gotta let the past be the past, Jack.

146
00:16:21,422 --> 00:16:23,966
I come here tonight to settle us up.

147
00:16:23,967 --> 00:16:25,968
Now how you gonna be doin' that, fathead?

148
00:16:25,969 --> 00:16:30,347
By doin' you a favor... a really big favor.
I'm as serious as cancer.

149
00:16:30,348 --> 00:16:33,350
Man, whatever this is,
I know it's bullshit.

150
00:16:33,351 --> 00:16:37,813
Jack, I have been tryin' to find a way
to straighten us out...

151
00:16:37,814 --> 00:16:40,566
and I finally come up with it.

152
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:45,367
Please, let bygones be bygones.

153
00:16:45,697 --> 00:16:49,950
Man, I can see why you might
wanna be on my good side.

154
00:16:49,951 --> 00:16:53,996
You wanna do me a favor 'cause you know...
you know I'm gonna be big...

155
00:16:53,997 --> 00:16:55,747
and you wanna be in on it.

156
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,624
All right, it's no secret.

157
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,751
I know where you're headed.

158
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:03,672
But just hear me out, see my little gift...

159
00:17:03,673 --> 00:17:05,716
and then, if you're not interested,
let me know.

160
00:17:05,717 --> 00:17:07,342
What's the gift?

161
00:17:07,343 --> 00:17:09,344
Oh, man, you gonna die.

162
00:17:09,345 --> 00:17:13,599
I have got a piece of chicken you ain't
even gonna believe is from this planet.

163
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,400
- No, that I might believe.
- Oh, Jack, be serious, man.

164
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:22,190
This girl is 19. A beautiful white girl.

165
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:26,991
A Cajun goddess, man. A Cajun goddess.

166
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:30,282
I got her up at
the Belle Chasse Hotel right now.

167
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:32,534
And she's waiting there for you, Jack.

168
00:17:32,535 --> 00:17:37,335
My gift to you. The most beautifulest gift
that I could possibly give you.

169
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:41,351
I mean, I can't believe you think
I'm gonna fall for this.

170
00:17:42,211 --> 00:17:45,797
Hey, go over there, check it out.

171
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:50,539
If I'm crazy or lyin',
you don't lose nothin'.

172
00:17:50,928 --> 00:17:54,723
Matter of fact, I just wanted
to give you first shot at her...

173
00:17:54,724 --> 00:17:59,227
before she all used up,
because she is gorgeous, man.

174
00:17:59,228 --> 00:18:00,812
Then why don't you want her, man?

175
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,981
Why don't you give her
to one of your so-called real friends...

176
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:05,192
one of those assholes
down on Decatur Street, huh?

177
00:18:05,193 --> 00:18:08,070
Because I've been trying
to make us be friends again.

178
00:18:08,071 --> 00:18:10,537
Can't you just accept that?

179
00:18:13,743 --> 00:18:16,628
All right. And I suppose
you haven't even touched her, right?

180
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:20,624
All right, I'll go look
at your martian goddess.

181
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:23,251
But I'm telling you something.
If you're foolin' with me...

182
00:18:23,252 --> 00:18:26,922
if you're wastin' my time, if anythin',
I'm gonna fuck you up.

183
00:18:26,923 --> 00:18:28,924
I guarantee it.

184
00:18:28,925 --> 00:18:32,761
Jack, nobody's gonna regret anythin',
especially not you.

185
00:18:32,762 --> 00:18:34,763
In fact, you're gonna thank me for this.

186
00:18:34,764 --> 00:18:37,224
You're gonna remember me
for the rest of your life for this.

187
00:18:37,225 --> 00:18:39,546
Yeah? Okay.

188
00:19:11,843 --> 00:19:15,303
- You makin' any money, baby?
- Ain't nothin' happenin'.

189
00:19:15,304 --> 00:19:19,222
- Pretty thing like you? Why not?
- I don't know.

190
00:19:20,268 --> 00:19:23,267
- All right. Check you out later.
- All right, Jack.

191
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:26,648
Hey, L.C. What's happenin'?

192
00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:28,775
Hey, Jack. Good to see you.

193
00:19:28,776 --> 00:19:30,777

194
00:19:30,778 --> 00:19:33,822
- Yeah. I got some things to check out.
- How's the ladies treatin' you?

195
00:19:33,823 --> 00:19:36,491
- Ow.
- Well, you know, Jack, how that goes.

196
00:19:36,492 --> 00:19:39,870
If you get enough of it,
do like a crawfish. Back on out of it.

197
00:19:39,871 --> 00:19:42,723
- I'll see you, L.C.
- All right. Take care, Jack.

198
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:51,465
- Hey, Julie. How's it goin'?
- All right.

199
00:19:51,466 --> 00:19:53,787
Hang in there now.

200
00:20:34,217 --> 00:20:36,828
I heard you're lookin'
for someone to take care of you.

201
00:20:40,431 --> 00:20:43,600
Now what you want is someone
who's gonna treat you like a lady.

202
00:20:43,601 --> 00:20:48,313
I don't know if you've been on the streets
here or not, but they can be very serious.

203
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:50,732
These guys...

204
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:54,069
I mean, chances are you're gonna find
somebody who's gonna get you strung out...

205
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:57,310
'cause he's strung out,
and then he's gonna own you.

206
00:20:58,282 --> 00:21:00,701
Some guy's gonna cut you, hurt you.

207
00:21:02,078 --> 00:21:05,789
With me, you're gonna be makin' money.
You're gonna have jewelry.

208
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:10,585
Whatever you want. Check it out.
I got the right connects.

You work with me,
I'm gonna take care of you.

211
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:19,424
Don't shoot me! Don't...

212
00:21:21,138 --> 00:21:23,807
- Where you at, Jack?
- Mandino, what are you doin'?

213
00:21:23,808 --> 00:21:26,274
Man, I'm here with my girlfriend.

214
00:21:33,109 --> 00:21:36,930
This is ridiculous, man.
What are you tryin' to pull on me?

215
00:21:37,238 --> 00:21:38,978
Jack.

216
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:43,331
Jack, Jack. You're a sick son of a bitch.

217
00:21:44,954 --> 00:21:48,415
- Is that your girlfriend? - Man, you
know I'm not into this kinda... Ow!

218
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,898
Get this son of a bitch out of here.
Get this pervert out of here!

219
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:55,734
Shit.

220
00:21:58,467 --> 00:22:00,208
Okay, Rich.

221
00:22:00,803 --> 00:22:03,124
I'll take care of the kid.

222
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:09,391
It's okay, darlin'. Everything's all right.

223
00:22:12,315 --> 00:22:14,732
It's all over now.

224
00:22:16,193 --> 00:22:20,993
Look, we're just gonna...

What the fuck you doin'
out here in the garbage?

258
00:25:12,661 --> 00:25:15,080
Just leave me alone, Preston.

259
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:19,834
I'm in a bad mood.

260

Well, then I'm just the man

In fact, I been lookin' for you.

00:25:26,008 --> 00:25:30,637
- That's a bad sign.
- Now, Zack, baby.

263
00:25:30,638 --> 00:25:33,492
I got somethin' real good for you.

264
00:25:34,517 --> 00:25:37,519
An hour's work for a whole lot of scratch.

265
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,689
- I ain't interested, man.
- Man, you are in a bad mood.

266
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:45,318
- You ain't even let me propose
this shit to you. -

267
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:48,238
Just listen to me for one minute, will ya?

268
00:25:48,239 --> 00:25:52,011
One minute of your, uh, valuable time.

Just fuck off, Preston.

270
00:26:03,546 --> 00:26:06,923
All I want to do is pay you a grand...

271
00:26:06,924 --> 00:26:11,724
in exchange for a single hour
of your very, very valuable time.

272
00:26:12,388 --> 00:26:16,933
Now this ain't no breaking and entering
or small-time chump change.

No delivery of controlled substances.
None of that stuff.

274
00:26:22,064 --> 00:26:26,864
This is just to drive a car
from one part of town to the other, alone.

275
00:26:30,281 --> 00:26:32,657
That's it.

276
00:26:32,658 --> 00:26:36,077
Well, what kind of car
would that be, Preston?

277
00:26:36,078 --> 00:26:38,913
That would be a very nice car.

278
00:26:40,749 --> 00:26:44,836
A very nice, very expensive imported car...

279
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:48,381
which just happens to be
between owners at the present time.

280
00:26:48,382 --> 00:26:52,093
Oh, I see.Just in between owners.

281
00:26:52,094 --> 00:26:55,889
Look, all you got to do, man,
is drive the car across town...

282
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:58,641
park it, leave it.

283
00:26:58,642 --> 00:27:01,769
And, look, I'm gonna
give you half up front and half later.

284
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:04,898
The whole thing's over in an hour.

285
00:27:04,899 --> 00:27:08,443
Very safe, very clean.

286
00:27:08,444 --> 00:27:12,655
And believe me, I could get
a million guys to do this for me.

287
00:27:12,656 --> 00:27:16,034
Well, then, why don't you do it yourself?

288
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:20,835
I'm offering a grand so I don't have
to answer stupid questions like that.

289
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:27,925
Well, I might consider a grand up front.

290
00:27:30,466 --> 00:27:32,800
Then I might think about it.

291
00:27:32,801 --> 00:27:35,122
Jesus Christ.

292
00:27:40,017 --> 00:27:44,079
Zack, you are in a nasty mood.

293
00:27:44,521 --> 00:27:47,982
Now, just to make you
cheer up a little bit...

294
00:27:47,983 --> 00:27:51,444
I'll give you 750 in front, okay?

295
00:27:51,445 --> 00:27:52,654
Shit.

296
00:27:52,655 --> 00:27:57,367
All right, all right,
Mr. Almighty Hot Shit.

297
00:27:57,368 --> 00:27:59,737
Look, I'm gonna do you this favor.

298
00:28:01,497 --> 00:28:05,124
Oh, man. A Jaguar, huh?

299
00:28:07,711 --> 00:28:12,113
Look, man, I'm gonna
give you the whole thing, up front.

300
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:15,454
And you gonna owe me one.

301
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:25,949
Zack, you can buy yourself
20 girls for all of that.

302
00:28:30,651 --> 00:28:33,746

What?

333
00:31:34,585 --> 00:31:38,647

- Hands up on the hood, jackass. Move!

334
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:43,050
- Move!
- Spread 'em out.

goosey-goosey goin' here.

337
00:31:47,055 --> 00:31:48,973

I don't care if you done nothin'.
Let's see what we got here.

In here.

360
00:35:40,914 --> 00:35:43,874
Excuse me.
Now can I get a light for my cigarette?

361
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:47,002
- Didn't I give you a match this
morning? - That was five, six hours ago.

362
00:35:47,003 --> 00:35:50,776
- I'll be back in a couple
of hours. - Man, come on.

363
00:36:01,518 --> 00:36:03,258
Shit.

364
00:36:34,384 --> 00:36:37,576
Guard! I need a light here.

365
00:36:39,222 --> 00:36:41,557
I can't believe this.

366
00:36:41,558 --> 00:36:46,187
Guard! Guard! Guard! Guard!
Guard! Guard! Guard!

367
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:51,205
What am I doin' in here?

368
00:36:54,529 --> 00:36:56,864
Can't you see?

369
00:36:56,865 --> 00:37:01,605
You are not
the only innocent asshole in here.

370
00:37:04,748 --> 00:37:07,069
I was set up too.

371
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:11,031
Just like you were.

372
00:37:12,422 --> 00:37:14,215
Just like you.

373
00:37:14,216 --> 00:37:16,550
Man, I am not just like you,
whatever you say.

374
00:37:16,551 --> 00:37:18,636
I don't even want to deal with you.
You got it, man?

375
00:37:18,637 --> 00:37:22,554
As far as I'm concerned,
you don't even exist. Not at all.

376
00:37:23,058 --> 00:37:25,379
Got it?

377
00:37:44,454 --> 00:37:46,775
Well, you don't exist either.

378
00:37:55,173 --> 00:37:57,494
The walls don't exist.

379
00:37:59,469 --> 00:38:01,935
The floor doesn't exist.

380
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:08,815
This prison's not here.
These bunks aren't here.

381
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:14,748
The bars aren't here.

382
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,536
None of this is really here.

383
00:38:24,744 --> 00:38:27,065
None of this is really here at all.

384
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,715
What's the matter with you, man?

385
00:38:37,716 --> 00:38:40,423
Huh? What's goin' on inside there?

386
00:38:42,429 --> 00:38:45,089
You haven't said nothin' in three days.

387
00:38:45,724 --> 00:38:48,915
Man, you gotta say somethin'.
Just say somethin'.

388
00:38:50,812 --> 00:38:53,182
Fuck you.

389
00:38:55,317 --> 00:38:58,110
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you.

390
00:38:58,111 --> 00:39:01,836
Okay, fuck you. That's fine.

391
00:39:04,993 --> 00:39:07,314
You piss me off, you know that?

392
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:15,744
Man, you know what I'm gonna do
when I get out of here?

393
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:20,292
When I get out of here...

394
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:25,137
there's gonna be a white limousine.

395
00:39:25,138 --> 00:39:28,766
It's gonna come and pick me up.

396
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:31,088
It's gonna be a Lincoln.

397
00:39:32,145 --> 00:39:34,466
I'm gonna step inside...

398
00:39:36,816 --> 00:39:41,169
and inside it's bigger than you could
possibly imagine it from the outside.

399
00:39:43,406 --> 00:39:46,867
And there's gonna be beautiful girls
in there... four of 'em...

400
00:39:46,868 --> 00:39:49,189
and they're all gonna be naked.

401
00:39:51,414 --> 00:39:56,214
And one of 'em's gonna offer me some coke.

402
00:39:56,711 --> 00:39:59,032
But I'm gonna just say no.

403
00:40:02,676 --> 00:40:07,476
I'm gonna just be enjoying
the luxury of the car and the girls.

404
00:40:09,057 --> 00:40:11,392
And the door's gonna close...

405
00:40:11,393 --> 00:40:13,714
and it's just gonna go "click."

406
00:40:14,521 --> 00:40:16,522
And there's gonna be music playin'.

407
00:40:16,523 --> 00:40:19,957
It's like music I never heard before.

408
00:40:22,404 --> 00:40:25,280
And then the car's gonna start up...

409
00:40:25,281 --> 00:40:30,077
and it's gonna drive slowly
towards the city, very slowly.

410
00:40:30,078 --> 00:40:33,247
It's gonna be beautiful, man.

411
00:40:33,248 --> 00:40:35,763
Yes.

412
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:40,962
- You're such an asshole.
- What?

413
00:40:43,133 --> 00:40:46,427
- You're an asshole.
- Yeah, why am I an asshole, huh?

414
00:40:46,428 --> 00:40:48,846
Why am I an asshole?

415
00:40:48,847 --> 00:40:52,766
'Cause you imagine all this insane shit...

416
00:40:52,767 --> 00:40:57,396
like you were... Bebe Rebozo or something.

417
00:40:57,397 --> 00:41:01,508
Yeah? Who's Bebe Rebozo?

418
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:05,612
Zack, who's Bebe Rebozo?

419
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,440
What'd you do on the outside?

420
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:18,333
You were a garbageman, right?

421
00:41:18,334 --> 00:41:20,711
I wasn't no garbageman.

422
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:23,033
Well, what'd you do then?

423
00:41:25,425 --> 00:41:27,987
- I was a deejay.
- What?

424
00:41:29,512 --> 00:41:32,124
- I was a deejay.
- A music deejay?

425
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:36,435
- Yeah.
- Nah, man. I don't believe it. Really?

426
00:41:36,436 --> 00:41:39,918
What station? I listen to the radio.
I must have heard you.

427
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:44,973
Shit. WYLD.

428
00:41:45,904 --> 00:41:49,073
- Lee Baby Simms.
- You're Lee Baby Simms?

429
00:41:49,074 --> 00:41:51,450
- No.
- Yeah.

430
00:41:51,451 --> 00:41:54,536
- You heard of me?
- Nope.

431
00:41:54,537 --> 00:41:57,372
Fuck you.

432
00:41:57,373 --> 00:42:00,375
Ah, I can't believe it.
I got a deejay in here with me?

433
00:42:00,376 --> 00:42:02,377
I think that's unbelievable, man.

434
00:42:02,378 --> 00:42:05,506
Why don't you do, like,
a little, you know...

435
00:42:05,507 --> 00:42:07,841
a thing, you know, a talk?

436
00:42:07,842 --> 00:42:11,095
I don't feel like it.

437
00:42:11,096 --> 00:42:15,593
Come on, man. Do...
You know, do the weather or something.

438
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:22,439
Man, what's it like outside?
Why don't you tell me that?

439
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,024
- Cold.
- What else? Come on.

440
00:42:24,025 --> 00:42:26,401
Tell me some stuff, you know.
Go ahead. Do a thing.

441
00:42:26,402 --> 00:42:29,449
Come on.

442
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:33,158
All right. Okay.

443
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:36,206
All right.

444
00:42:39,916 --> 00:42:42,209
Let's see, um...

445
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:43,950
Okay.

446
00:42:45,421 --> 00:42:48,298
Well, we got about 12 below
the big red line.

447
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:52,719
Slick, icy road conditions
out there tonight, Bob. You betcha.

448
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,430
All you holiday travelers beware.

449
00:42:55,431 --> 00:42:59,852
Looks like we got about a four-car pileup
out there on the airline highway.

450
00:42:59,853 --> 00:43:01,834
I'm gonna switch over
to our mobile unit now.

451
00:43:01,835 --> 00:43:03,897
Chip, what does it look
like out there to you?

452
00:43:03,898 --> 00:43:06,483
- You know, it was that type of thing.
- Come on, do some more.

453
00:43:06,484 --> 00:43:08,110
- That was cool.
- Weather and bullshit.

454
00:43:08,111 --> 00:43:09,403
- Do some more.
- Nah.

455
00:43:09,404 --> 00:43:11,363
Come on.

456
00:43:11,364 --> 00:43:13,782
Do some more.

457
00:43:13,783 --> 00:43:16,055
All right, okay.

458
00:43:17,036 --> 00:43:19,288
Let's see.

459
00:43:19,289 --> 00:43:23,690
All right. Uh...

460
00:43:24,752 --> 00:43:27,751
Uh... okay.

461
00:43:30,884 --> 00:43:35,429
Well, we got about 10:43... Coming up
on 10:43 here in the Crescent City.

462
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:39,683
We're goin' around and around with the big
sound from the big town right here on WYLD.

I'm gonna be down there.

Right now we're gonna hear

470
00:44:03,458 --> 00:44:06,877
I wanna send this one out

471
00:44:06,878 --> 00:44:09,588
Little Lyle,

472
00:44:09,589 --> 00:44:13,926
Lone Wolf, Nashville Kid, Nadine...

00:44:13,927 --> 00:44:17,638
Dwight, Tyrone and the Golden Boys.

474
00:44:17,639 --> 00:44:22,100
Let's hear a little somethin'
from Earl King, New Orleans's own.

475
00:44:22,101 --> 00:44:25,103
Little somethin' called "Trick Bag."

476
00:44:25,104 --> 00:44:27,814
You know.

477
00:44:27,815 --> 00:44:29,650
Man, what is wrong with you?

478
00:44:29,651 --> 00:44:32,736
It's like pulling teeth tryin' to get you
to talk, and you're a fuckin' deejay.

479
00:44:32,737 --> 00:44:35,687
What is wrong with you anyways?

480
00:45:05,603 --> 00:45:07,924
Hey, cut it out.

481
00:45:10,692 --> 00:45:12,693
Stop it!

482
00:45:12,694 --> 00:45:15,362
Man, don't you know you're makin' time
go slower? Cut it out.

483
00:45:15,363 --> 00:45:17,249
Why? Ow!

484
00:45:17,532 --> 00:45:19,574
- Kick his fuckin' ass!
- Come on!

485
00:45:19,575 --> 00:45:21,576
You fucker. I'm gonna fuck you up, man.

486
00:45:21,577 --> 00:45:24,329
Hey, we got a fight startin' up!

487
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:37,210
Come on!

488
00:45:58,781 --> 00:46:01,296
Get in there, huh?

489
00:46:02,076 --> 00:46:04,077
He don't even speak no English.

490
00:46:04,078 --> 00:46:07,270
Homicidal son of a bitch says he's Italian.

491
00:46:12,962 --> 00:46:16,396
And why don't you take a flying fuck?

492
00:47:25,993 --> 00:47:30,793
If looks can kill, I am dead now.

493
00:48:06,742 --> 00:48:09,202
I "ham" Roberto.

494
00:48:09,203 --> 00:48:12,589
Roberto. Call me Bob. The same.

495
00:48:37,773 --> 00:48:41,255
No good here... for me.

496
00:48:44,405 --> 00:48:46,339
Is, uh...

497
00:48:46,782 --> 00:48:48,523
Is...

498
00:48:56,959 --> 00:48:59,280
Is, uh...

499
00:48:59,962 --> 00:49:03,465
Excuse me. Excuse me.

500
00:49:03,466 --> 00:49:06,009
Excuse me.

501
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:08,845
Not enough room to swing a cat.

502
00:49:11,557 --> 00:49:13,878
Cat. The animal.

503
00:49:26,781 --> 00:49:28,907
- Excuse me, Jack...
- Zack!

504
00:49:28,908 --> 00:49:33,708
Zack. I have the "hicc-outs."
Do you have some cigarette?

505
00:49:33,788 --> 00:49:36,109
No.

506
00:49:37,458 --> 00:49:40,126
- No!
- No. I understand.

507
00:49:40,127 --> 00:49:42,497
Thank you.

508
00:49:48,636 --> 00:49:52,167
Do you have, uh, Zack, some cigarette?

509
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:54,933
I'm Jack. Get it straight.

510
00:49:54,934 --> 00:49:57,449
Yes. Got it straight.

511
00:50:03,818 --> 00:50:05,827
But do you have some cigarette?

512
00:50:05,828 --> 00:50:08,546
Cigarettes won't help with hiccups.
Not in this country.

513
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:12,459
Me, yes, uh, c-c-cigarette help me...

514
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:15,852
with the... when I have...
the hicc-outs.

515
00:50:24,005 --> 00:50:26,955
- Don't ask me again.
- Thank you.

516
00:50:32,471 --> 00:50:35,808
Do you have, uh...

517
00:50:35,891 --> 00:50:37,142
Jack?

518
00:50:38,311 --> 00:50:41,021
Jack, do you have some fire?

519
00:50:41,022 --> 00:50:43,343
No.

520
00:50:51,407 --> 00:50:53,783
- Excuse me, Jack, do... Zack!
- Zack!

521
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:55,368
- I'm Zack.
- Zack.

522
00:50:55,369 --> 00:50:57,746
He's Jack. I'm Zack.

523
00:50:57,747 --> 00:51:00,582
Do you have some fire?

524
00:51:00,583 --> 00:51:04,544
No. Matches aren't allowed here.

525
00:51:04,545 --> 00:51:06,770
Do you understand?

526
00:51:07,548 --> 00:51:09,869
Yes. Yes, I see.

527
00:51:12,928 --> 00:51:15,298
I see.

528
00:51:33,366 --> 00:51:35,617
Do you like Walt Whitman?

529
00:51:35,618 --> 00:51:40,418
Yes, I like Walt Whitman very much.
Leaves of "Glass."

530
00:51:41,624 --> 00:51:43,458
What?

531
00:51:43,459 --> 00:51:47,038
Nothing. I said,
"Do you like Walt Whitman?"

532
00:51:51,884 --> 00:51:53,551
Walt Whitman?

533
00:51:53,552 --> 00:51:56,513
Yes. I like Walt Whitman very much.

534
00:51:56,514 --> 00:51:58,931
Very good, Leaves of "Glass."

535
00:51:59,642 --> 00:52:02,059
Leaves of "Glass."

536
00:52:10,528 --> 00:52:12,849
Walt Whitman.

537
00:52:17,618 --> 00:52:19,939
Walt Whitman.

538
00:52:49,608 --> 00:52:53,623
Zaaa-ta.

539
00:52:54,113 --> 00:52:56,822
[Speaking Italian]

540
00:53:00,244 --> 00:53:04,065
What the hell are you doin'?

541
00:53:26,729 --> 00:53:30,315
- Bob? Bob?
- Yes?

542
00:53:30,316 --> 00:53:32,637
What the hell are you doin'?

543
00:53:35,488 --> 00:53:38,195
I make-a a window.

544
00:53:38,365 --> 00:53:39,657
Huh?

545
00:53:39,658 --> 00:53:41,979
That's good, Bob.

546
00:53:43,704 --> 00:53:47,916
Excuse me. Do you say in English,
"I looka at the window"...

547
00:53:47,917 --> 00:53:52,337
or do you say in English,
"I looka out the window"?

548
00:53:52,338 --> 00:53:56,836
Well, in this case, Bob, I'm afraid
you gotta say, "I look at the window."

549
00:54:20,032 --> 00:54:24,832
So, uh, Za... Jack.
Jack, why-why are you put in this place?

550
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:29,562
I don't know, Bob. It was, like,
voodoo or something, you know?

551
00:54:31,418 --> 00:54:35,505
I was framed. I'm completely innocent.
You understand?

552
00:54:35,506 --> 00:54:38,007
- Yes. You are innocent man.
- Yeah.

553
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:39,943
I understand.

554
00:54:42,763 --> 00:54:47,213
And you, my friend, Zack,
why are you put in this prison?

555
00:54:49,061 --> 00:54:51,382
I was set up, Bob.

556
00:54:52,731 --> 00:54:55,440
- Just like Jack.
- Hmm.

557
00:54:58,696 --> 00:55:02,517
I "ham" an innocent man.

558
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:08,834
I see. You too are an innocent man.

559
00:55:14,461 --> 00:55:16,337
- So, Bob...
- Yes?

560
00:55:16,338 --> 00:55:18,757
For why are you in this prison put?

561
00:55:19,758 --> 00:55:23,434
Me? I killed "hay" man.

562
00:55:40,946 --> 00:55:43,316
You killed a man, huh?

563
00:55:49,997 --> 00:55:52,332
What'd you do that for, Bob?

564
00:55:52,333 --> 00:55:55,815
The guy didn't like Walt Whitman?

565
00:55:59,673 --> 00:56:02,967
I never asked this man
if he liked Walt Whitman.

566
00:56:08,474 --> 00:56:11,665
Come on, Bob. Why'd you kill a man?

567
00:56:12,603 --> 00:56:17,315
I, uh... We-We was, uh, playing-a card.

568
00:56:17,316 --> 00:56:21,569
No? Table. I have no money,
but I am a cheater.

569
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:23,738
- Yeah?
- Very good.

570
00:56:23,739 --> 00:56:27,492
But I don't know...
I don't know why they...

571
00:56:27,493 --> 00:56:31,371
they notice after a while
I-I-I-I am a cheater.

572
00:56:31,372 --> 00:56:34,040
It's strange, really. I'm a good cheater.

573
00:56:34,041 --> 00:56:38,841
They notice, and I run... run away,
and they run back me, yes.

574
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:43,675
In another room with the billiard,
pool... the pool, no?

575
00:56:43,676 --> 00:56:46,052
There. And, uh... And, uh...

576
00:56:46,053 --> 00:56:48,304
But I was very fast, very speedy.

577
00:56:48,305 --> 00:56:51,975
And they for stop me,
take a ball... take ball... many ball.

578
00:56:51,976 --> 00:56:53,851
Ta!

579
00:56:53,852 --> 00:56:56,813
Very "closed." Ta! Ta! Ta!

580
00:56:56,814 --> 00:57:01,025
And I... You...
You throw ball against me...

581
00:57:01,026 --> 00:57:03,152
I throw ball against you, no?

582
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:07,953
I take one ball... a number eight.
Very good ball. Black ball.

583
00:57:08,367 --> 00:57:10,910
Ta! Tum! Ta!

584
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:13,813
In the ground. First stroke. Ha!

585
00:57:14,999 --> 00:57:17,917
Dead. Very big man.

586
00:57:17,918 --> 00:57:20,294
On the ground. First stroke.

587
00:57:20,295 --> 00:57:25,095
Is that true, Bob? This is a true story?

588
00:57:25,384 --> 00:57:27,301
- True story?
- Yeah.

589
00:57:27,302 --> 00:57:30,059
Ha. "True story."

590
00:57:30,764 --> 00:57:32,844
True story.

591
00:57:34,101 --> 00:57:35,810
Very true story.

592
00:57:35,811 --> 00:57:38,665
- On the ground, the first stroke.
- Hmm.

593
00:57:39,398 --> 00:57:43,109
You throw the ball against me?

594
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:45,431
I throw ball against you.

595
00:57:46,739 --> 00:57:51,189
But I "ham" no criminal.
I "ham" a good egg.

596
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:57,582
I am a good egg.Jesus.

597
00:57:57,583 --> 00:57:59,372
- Yes.
- Yeah.

598
00:57:59,835 --> 00:58:01,169
I "ham" a good egg.

599
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:05,813
Yes. We are. We are a good egg.

600
00:58:06,884 --> 00:58:09,979
- My friends.
- Get off.

601
00:58:30,074 --> 00:58:31,427
Yes.

602
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:39,832
Watch out for Bob. He may be cheating.

603
00:58:41,627 --> 00:58:44,295
Is no joke. Look where I am.

604
00:58:44,296 --> 00:58:46,617
Is no funny.

605
00:58:49,843 --> 00:58:51,677
- I have two pair.
- What? What?

606
00:58:51,678 --> 00:58:53,613
Two pair.

607
00:58:54,932 --> 00:58:57,183
- What do you got?
- Nothing.

608
00:58:57,184 --> 00:58:59,936

609
00:58:59,937 --> 00:59:04,357
Ahhh-ha-ha!

610

Screaming? Screaming? Ah, screaming.

00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:18,996
Screaming. One moment. I have screaming.

614
00:59:18,997 --> 00:59:21,899
Heh. Screaming.

615
00:59:22,501 --> 00:59:24,794

619
00:59:35,556 --> 00:59:38,141

I scream-a, you scream-a,

622
00:59:47,025 --> 00:59:51,654
I scream, you scream,
we all scream for ice cream.

623
01:00:54,968 --> 01:00:58,583
I scream, you scream,
we all scream for ice cream!

624
01:01:06,764 --> 01:01:09,649
- Keep it down in here too.
- We all scream for ice cream.

625
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:12,693
- I scream, you scream...
- All right. Put a lid on it.

626
01:01:12,694 --> 01:01:14,779
- Put a lid on it.
- All right, quiet!

627
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:18,069
Kill the noise. Let's go. Kill the noise.

628
01:01:53,235 --> 01:01:58,035
Today... Today in the yard,
I make a discovery. Very interesting.

629
01:02:01,827 --> 01:02:06,277
And I think, uh...
I think a film I have seen in Italy.

630
01:02:06,707 --> 01:02:10,189
An American film,
very good, lots of action.

631
01:02:12,838 --> 01:02:16,127
It was, uh, a prison film.

632
01:02:16,717 --> 01:02:19,812
When, uh, with...
When, um...

633
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:24,557
H-How do you say in English, when, uh...

634
01:02:24,558 --> 01:02:27,768
when the man go out
of the prison, running away?

635
01:02:27,769 --> 01:02:29,603
- Escape.
- What?

636
01:02:29,604 --> 01:02:31,974
- Escape.
- Escape.

637
01:02:32,941 --> 01:02:36,617
Escape. Yes, escape.

638
01:02:37,738 --> 01:02:41,413
Today in the yard, I discover a way.

639
01:02:44,411 --> 01:02:46,203
Bob...

640
01:02:46,204 --> 01:02:48,914
there's no way you could escape
from the yard.

641
01:02:48,915 --> 01:02:50,656
There's no way.

642
01:02:50,917 --> 01:02:52,960
Forget it.

643
01:02:52,961 --> 01:02:54,754
Yes.

644
01:02:54,755 --> 01:02:56,047
Yes.

645
01:02:56,048 --> 01:03:00,304
Not from the yard. To the yard.

646
01:03:06,391 --> 01:03:09,922
If there was a way to get out of here,
we would know about it.

647
01:03:10,437 --> 01:03:13,146
It's your turn.

648
01:03:15,817 --> 01:03:19,320
Come on, Bob. It's no time for a joke.

649
01:03:19,321 --> 01:03:21,530
"Come on, Bob. It's no time for a joke?"

650
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:23,616
But I am no joke.

651
01:03:23,617 --> 01:03:26,518
I am very serious.

652
01:03:29,623 --> 01:03:32,524
I am sure.

653
01:03:41,051 --> 01:03:43,952
Here they come.

654
01:03:48,350 --> 01:03:50,351
Okay, you two.

655
01:03:50,352 --> 01:03:53,312
Time for your walk.

656
01:03:53,313 --> 01:03:55,564
Not you, shorty. It ain't your turn.

657
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:58,177
Come on. Let's go.

658
01:03:59,403 --> 01:04:03,272
But I no go for four days!
I no go. I missed my turn.

659
01:04:05,242 --> 01:04:07,576
Really, no joke. I "ham" a good egg.

660
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:10,621
I no go for four days.
Four days. I missed my turn.

661
01:04:10,622 --> 01:04:12,998
All right, all right, Leonardo da Vinci.
Come on.

662
01:04:12,999 --> 01:04:16,434
Grazie, grazie.

663
01:05:15,061 --> 01:05:19,861
We... We have escaped
like in the American movies.

664
01:05:24,571 --> 01:05:26,155
- Hey.
- Yeah?

665
01:05:26,156 --> 01:05:29,950
Shh!

666
01:05:29,951 --> 01:05:33,240
Yeah, man.
Out of the frying pan and into the fire.

667
01:05:57,771 --> 01:05:59,995
We could actually make it.

668
01:06:00,607 --> 01:06:03,984
We gotta cross the river.

669
01:06:03,985 --> 01:06:07,661
It's our only chance
of losing the scent of the dogs.

670
01:06:07,739 --> 01:06:10,282
Ah, yeah, yeah. This part I remember.

671
01:06:10,283 --> 01:06:14,036
Shut up.

672
01:06:14,037 --> 01:06:16,552
But I cannot swim.

673
01:06:17,290 --> 01:06:19,542
Oh, man.

674
01:06:19,543 --> 01:06:21,794
Shit!

675
01:06:21,795 --> 01:06:24,255
We gotta do it.

676
01:06:24,256 --> 01:06:25,839
We gotta cross.

677
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:30,640
Maybe Mark Twain will come by
and pick you up in a steamboat.

678
01:06:30,929 --> 01:06:35,140
- I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.
- Hey.

679
01:06:35,141 --> 01:06:39,941
My-My friends, wait!
No time for a joke. I cannot swim.

680
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:44,358
Jack and Zack, my friends. I cannot swim!

681
01:06:48,655 --> 01:06:50,197
Jack!

682
01:06:52,367 --> 01:06:54,059
Oh!

683
01:07:52,052 --> 01:07:55,971
Arregg the dogs! Arregg the dogs!
Don't shoot me, please.

684
01:07:58,808 --> 01:08:01,710
Jack, my friend! Jack...

685
01:08:21,498 --> 01:08:22,831
Hey.

686
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:25,444
He sleeps.

687
01:08:27,337 --> 01:08:30,626
Well, I ain't going to sleep
around here, man.

688
01:08:31,091 --> 01:08:32,831
Mm-mmm.

689
01:08:34,135 --> 01:08:37,054
This whole place
is crawling with alligators.

690
01:08:37,055 --> 01:08:38,795
Big ones.

691
01:08:40,433 --> 01:08:43,142
And snakes of all kinds.

692
01:08:43,853 --> 01:08:46,063
You got water moccasins...

693
01:08:46,064 --> 01:08:48,023
copperheads...

694
01:08:48,024 --> 01:08:51,610
diamondbacks, you name it, man.

695
01:08:51,611 --> 01:08:54,367
There's all kinds of shit out there.

696
01:08:56,449 --> 01:08:59,618
I say we rest here for a while...

697
01:08:59,619 --> 01:09:02,134
then we keep moving until daybreak.

698
01:09:06,376 --> 01:09:09,277
How big the alligators are?

699
01:09:11,131 --> 01:09:15,931
Uh, 12, maybe 15 feet long.

700
01:09:19,347 --> 01:09:22,829
Pretty near three times your size, Bob.

701
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:33,600
Red ants.

702
01:09:35,405 --> 01:09:38,500
They can eat an entire family
in a half an hour.

703
01:09:41,745 --> 01:09:45,081
My family in half an hour?

704
01:10:21,785 --> 01:10:23,869
What's wrong, Bob?

705
01:10:23,870 --> 01:10:27,247
I have lost my book of English.

706
01:10:27,248 --> 01:10:30,083
No. All I ever knowed is there.

707
01:10:30,084 --> 01:10:33,857
Come on, man. You're lucky to even be here.

708
01:10:35,965 --> 01:10:40,028
I am lucky to even be here.

709
01:12:29,162 --> 01:12:32,664
Ah.

710
01:12:32,665 --> 01:12:35,374
Matches.

711
01:12:45,428 --> 01:12:47,943
Man, this looks a little too familiar.

712
01:12:52,435 --> 01:12:55,144
I gotta get away from you guys.

713
01:12:55,855 --> 01:12:58,176
Yeah, that would be nice.

714
01:12:59,776 --> 01:13:02,611
The only problem is
we don't know where the hell we are.

715
01:13:07,533 --> 01:13:09,785
All right, look.

716
01:13:09,786 --> 01:13:12,348
I say we hole up here for the night...

717
01:13:14,707 --> 01:13:16,708
and tomorrow we leave in the boat.

718
01:13:16,709 --> 01:13:19,419
Yo, man, who the fuck put you in charge?

719
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:22,419
I put myself in charge, man...

720
01:13:22,590 --> 01:13:24,508
because you can't keep it together.

721
01:13:24,509 --> 01:13:27,071
Aw, man.

722
01:13:28,554 --> 01:13:31,181
- The guy's a nut job.
- Fuck you.

723
01:13:31,182 --> 01:13:33,454
My job?

724
01:13:33,726 --> 01:13:34,768
Shit.

725
01:13:34,769 --> 01:13:39,147
I think we should go to Mississippi,
'cause that's the closest border.

726
01:13:39,148 --> 01:13:42,901
I-I-I would like to go to west, to Texas.

727
01:13:42,902 --> 01:13:45,362
- No. No.
- A very strange country...

728
01:13:45,363 --> 01:13:47,698
I have seen in many beautiful films, eh?

729
01:13:47,799 --> 01:13:49,867
That's insane, man. If
we go to Mississippi,

730
01:13:49,868 --> 01:13:51,518
we get caught, we get a retrial.

731
01:13:51,519 --> 01:13:53,820
If we go to Texas,
we get caught, we're fucked.

732
01:13:53,821 --> 01:13:55,622
Who told you that?

733
01:13:55,623 --> 01:13:58,583
My lawyer told me that
when I was gonna skip bond.

734
01:13:58,584 --> 01:14:00,961
Your lawyer. Bunch of bullshit.

735
01:14:00,962 --> 01:14:04,423
Texas, ragazzi. Very good in Texas. Huh?

736
01:14:04,724 --> 01:14:07,676
Cool, man. You go to Texas.
You go to Mars, for all I care.

737
01:14:07,677 --> 01:14:10,047
Just leave me alone, all right?

738
01:14:10,263 --> 01:14:14,182
Look. We're all staying together...

739
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:16,309
until we find out where the hell we are.

740
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:20,808
Right, Lieutenant. Cool, cool. Yeah.

741
01:14:21,274 --> 01:14:23,650
Hey, would you mind, uh...

742
01:14:23,651 --> 01:14:25,360
Scram.

743
01:14:25,361 --> 01:14:28,602
Go. Scram. Move.

744
01:14:40,793 --> 01:14:43,695
Zack, do you like Robert Frost?

745
01:14:45,757 --> 01:14:48,271
Not this again, man.

746
01:14:49,010 --> 01:14:50,844
Uh...

747
01:14:50,845 --> 01:14:52,150
Uh...

748
01:15:04,484 --> 01:15:08,987
"A Road Less Traveled," by Bob Frost.

749
01:15:08,988 --> 01:15:12,858
He was a very cynical man.

750
01:15:15,161 --> 01:15:17,966
- Robert Frost.
- Right.

751
01:15:18,122 --> 01:15:19,748
In Italian?

752
01:15:19,749 --> 01:15:24,441
Yes.
I have read only your poets in Italian.

753
01:15:27,715 --> 01:15:30,300
- Bob Frost.
- Frost.

754
01:15:36,432 --> 01:15:38,642
- Bob Frost.
- Yeah.

755
01:15:48,528 --> 01:15:50,737
In Italian.

756
01:17:09,192 --> 01:17:12,986
Be careful, Jack! Watch out the trees.

757
01:17:12,987 --> 01:17:15,502
The trees! A lot of trees.

758
01:17:15,948 --> 01:17:19,534
- Be careful.
- Aw, shit.

759
01:17:19,535 --> 01:17:24,335
- Aw, shit!
- Look out! Another trees.

760
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:31,136
Dangerous. Watch out, I cannot swim.

761
01:17:35,468 --> 01:17:38,563
Be careful!

762
01:18:01,369 --> 01:18:04,851
Well, which way now?

763
01:18:08,251 --> 01:18:10,572
Man, haven't we been here before?

764
01:18:13,256 --> 01:18:16,738
Seems like we passed this fork hours ago.

765
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:21,599
Man, it all looks the same to me.
I really can't tell.

766
01:18:24,267 --> 01:18:27,458
We've been goin' around in circles, Jack.

767
01:18:32,066 --> 01:18:36,866
Ragazzi! Ragazzi! The boat! The boat!
The boat is finished.

768
01:18:37,029 --> 01:18:40,323
- There's water in the boat.
- Bail! Bail!

769
01:18:40,324 --> 01:18:42,909
- Go in the land! Go in the land!
- Move your leg.

770
01:18:42,910 --> 01:18:44,494
- No!
- Move your leg.

771
01:19:16,777 --> 01:19:19,873
Well, I don't know which way to go now.

772
01:19:25,453 --> 01:19:29,322
- What do you think, Jack?
- How the fuck should I know?

773
01:19:33,461 --> 01:19:36,943
Yeah, well, whatever you say, Jack.

774
01:20:04,241 --> 01:20:06,466
Hey, where is he?

775
01:20:07,244 --> 01:20:10,436
- What?
- Where's Bob?

776
01:20:10,956 --> 01:20:13,277
I don't know, man.

777
01:20:14,293 --> 01:20:16,808
He said something about food.

778
01:20:18,589 --> 01:20:22,265
- Maybe the alligators got him.
- Hey, man, don't say that.

779
01:20:25,221 --> 01:20:27,783
You know,
we could starve to death out here.

780
01:20:30,476 --> 01:20:32,507
Ah, nah.

781
01:20:32,812 --> 01:20:35,519
This swamp can't go on forever, man.

782
01:20:36,941 --> 01:20:40,423
- We'll find something.
- Man, he's leading us the wrong way.

783
01:20:45,616 --> 01:20:47,550
Who, Bob?

784
01:20:48,994 --> 01:20:51,079
He ain't leading us.

785
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:54,499
Hey, man, you don't seem
to think I see what's going on.

786
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:59,300
You're leadin' us around in circles. I'm
not blind to this. You're fuckin' us up.

787
01:20:59,713 --> 01:21:02,257
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

788
01:21:02,258 --> 01:21:06,511
That's right, man.
We're just gonna tire you out...

789
01:21:06,512 --> 01:21:08,521
then we're gonna move in for the kill.

790
01:21:08,522 --> 01:21:10,723
Then we're gonna have
Jack Romano for dinner.

791
01:21:10,724 --> 01:21:13,760
- Yeah, is that right, you fuckin' idiot,
man? - Yeah, you son of a...

792
01:21:13,761 --> 01:21:15,968
Come on! Come on!

793
01:21:17,022 --> 01:21:19,924
Come on, man. Come on.

794
01:21:22,319 --> 01:21:26,197
Stop! Stop, my friends!
Stop the fight! Stop!

795
01:21:26,198 --> 01:21:29,159
My friends, stop! Stop.

796
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:32,871
I have catched the rabbit... dinner.
For dinner.

797
01:21:32,872 --> 01:21:34,516
Huh?

798
01:21:35,875 --> 01:21:40,675
Fuck, man. I'm goin' off by myself.
I'm better off alone. Fuck.

799
01:21:41,422 --> 01:21:46,222
- It's all right with me, man.
- A rabbit. Very difficult to catch rabbit.

800
01:21:46,343 --> 01:21:50,054
- Every man for himself.
- Zack! Jack!

801
01:21:50,055 --> 01:21:54,855
I run half an hour for this rabbit.
Very cunning rabbit.

802
01:22:04,403 --> 01:22:07,112
Well, it's 46 degrees.

803
01:22:08,657 --> 01:22:10,241
Yeah.

804
01:22:10,242 --> 01:22:12,177
Slight breeze...

805
01:22:13,037 --> 01:22:15,914
blowing through some
of our cypress trees...

806
01:22:15,915 --> 01:22:20,715
that are blending in with
a lot of the smaller fir trees in the area.

807
01:22:22,213 --> 01:22:23,796
Yeah.

808
01:22:23,797 --> 01:22:26,118
Vegetation, well...

809
01:22:27,009 --> 01:22:30,929
I'd say offhand dates back
to the Mesozoic period...

810
01:22:30,930 --> 01:22:34,460
the Tigris-Euphrates River Valley...

811
01:22:34,683 --> 01:22:36,684
the cradle of civilization.

812
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:43,705
Guy's a fuckin' asshole, man. Shit.

813
01:22:45,236 --> 01:22:48,446
I'm fuckin' starvin' to death.

814
01:22:48,447 --> 01:22:53,247
Man, my thing was cool, boy, you know.
I had my things goin', you know.

815
01:22:53,536 --> 01:22:58,276
My last walk out was like,
"Hey, L.C., how you doin', man?"

816
01:22:59,208 --> 01:23:00,755
Oh.

817
01:23:01,794 --> 01:23:05,083
I'm sorry, baby. I didn't know
it was gonna be like that, man.

818
01:23:06,173 --> 01:23:07,914
Jack, Zack?

819
01:23:08,551 --> 01:23:09,968
Zack, Jack?

820
01:23:09,969 --> 01:23:11,322
Jack?

821
01:23:12,221 --> 01:23:15,139
Why do you leave me alone?

822
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:18,017
There is a very good... very good rabbit.

823
01:23:18,018 --> 01:23:21,938
I know a very good way to cook it.

824
01:23:21,939 --> 01:23:26,526
My-My mother teached me.
My mother, Isolina.

825
01:23:26,527 --> 01:23:29,612
The name of my mother. With rosmarino...

826
01:23:29,613 --> 01:23:32,657
rosmarino, olive oil, garlic...

827
01:23:32,658 --> 01:23:36,528
and other secrets of the Isolina.

828
01:23:39,248 --> 01:23:41,859
We're waiting right now for...

829
01:23:42,418 --> 01:23:45,755
a check on our general
barometric pressure.

830
01:23:47,047 --> 01:23:51,847
Then it's back to more music
with the Lee Baby Simms Show.

831
01:23:54,263 --> 01:23:56,003
Man.

832
01:23:57,891 --> 01:24:01,019
Didn't I tell that creep,
"She's not fuckin' available."

833
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:02,895
Right?

834
01:24:02,896 --> 01:24:06,186
Shut up!

835
01:24:08,694 --> 01:24:11,738
Before, she is very kind with the rabbit.

836
01:24:11,739 --> 01:24:16,539
She call the rabbit,
"Good rabbit. I like this little rabbit.

837
01:24:16,702 --> 01:24:18,828
The eyes of the ra"... Ta!

838
01:24:18,829 --> 01:24:22,206
Suddenly, the rabbit dead.

839
01:24:22,207 --> 01:24:25,109
Very strange mother, my mother.

840
01:24:25,252 --> 01:24:26,919
Very strange, yes.

841
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:31,720
My father, no. He's very strong,
but with the rabbit he is afraid.

842
01:24:31,842 --> 01:24:34,927
My sister... I have one mother
and three sisters.

843
01:24:34,928 --> 01:24:36,814
Bruna, Albertina, e Anna.

844
01:24:38,349 --> 01:24:42,310
I had a picture of my mother in my room...

845
01:24:42,311 --> 01:24:47,111
smiling with the rabbit in her hand
and the other, so... Ha, ta.

846
01:24:49,068 --> 01:24:52,612
Sometime I-I dream of my mother
that call me...

847
01:24:52,613 --> 01:24:56,532
"Robertino, vieni qua. Robertino, come on."

848
01:24:56,533 --> 01:24:59,327
"No, I don't want." "Come on. Come on."

849
01:24:59,328 --> 01:25:04,128
Ta! Una botta in my neck.
"I am not rabbit." "Yes, you are."

850
01:25:05,459 --> 01:25:07,586
My mother.

851
01:25:08,587 --> 01:25:10,505
Very strange mother.

852
01:25:10,506 --> 01:25:13,257
But I love my mother.

853
01:25:13,258 --> 01:25:18,058
Isolina, and my father, Gigi,
and my sisters Bruna, Albertina, e Anna.

854
01:25:18,764 --> 01:25:22,141
My family and my rabbit.

855
01:25:22,142 --> 01:25:26,942
And I love to catch, to dream.

856
01:25:29,358 --> 01:25:30,942
My mo...

857
01:25:30,943 --> 01:25:32,568
What is?

858
01:25:32,569 --> 01:25:36,614
What? Zack! Heh.Jack! Jack and Zack!

859
01:25:36,615 --> 01:25:38,866
I knew! Come on. Come on.

860
01:25:38,867 --> 01:25:41,369
To eat the animal I have catched.

861
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:45,790
The rabbit. I run half an hour
behind it. Very good.

862
01:25:45,791 --> 01:25:49,252
Come on. Jack, come on.

863
01:25:49,253 --> 01:25:52,714
Sit down. I am glad.

864
01:25:52,715 --> 01:25:56,300
Sit down, the fire. Yes. Yes, taste it.

865
01:25:56,301 --> 01:26:00,012
Yes, taste it. Taste, Zack, taste. Eh?

866
01:26:00,013 --> 01:26:04,308
Taste. In a moment.

867
01:26:04,309 --> 01:26:08,896
Yeah. Yeah.

868
01:26:08,897 --> 01:26:13,697
Huh? Of course,
I haven't garlic, rosmarino...

869
01:26:14,153 --> 01:26:18,215
very important...
and olive oil, but is good, eh?

870
01:26:19,575 --> 01:26:22,476
- It's disgusting, Bob.
- Yes.

871
01:26:23,829 --> 01:26:28,629
- Bob, it tastes like a tire.
- Yeah. I know, is very good.

872
01:27:17,424 --> 01:27:20,326
The road!

873
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:30,477
Ah, civilization.

874
01:27:34,316 --> 01:27:38,572
Well, which way now, Jack?

875
01:27:46,286 --> 01:27:49,188
Well, I say we go that way.

876
01:27:49,706 --> 01:27:53,914
- I agree.
- Aye, aye, Lieutenant.

877
01:28:26,869 --> 01:28:28,851
It's a mirage.

878
01:28:29,246 --> 01:28:31,616
You think we're imagining this?

879
01:28:32,332 --> 01:28:34,625
Well, if we are...

880
01:28:34,626 --> 01:28:37,576
I could use some imaginary pie and coffee.

881
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:45,797
One of us should go in there alone,
in case the law is inside.

882
01:28:49,808 --> 01:28:52,268
All right, Bob.

883
01:28:52,269 --> 01:28:57,069
I want you to go in there first.
Make sure everything's safe.

884
01:28:57,316 --> 01:29:01,694
If everything's all right,
you come back out and tell us.

885
01:29:01,695 --> 01:29:05,281
- You understand me?
- I understand. I "ham" ready.

886
01:29:05,282 --> 01:29:09,994
Okay. Hey, Bob, we'll be right here.

887
01:29:09,995 --> 01:29:12,896
- Right here waiting.
- Yes.

888
01:29:38,190 --> 01:29:42,252
Jesus, he walked right in there
like an idiot.

889
01:29:44,237 --> 01:29:47,527
- Let's hide over here.
- Yeah.

890
01:30:12,391 --> 01:30:14,615
Hey.

891
01:30:18,230 --> 01:30:21,131
How long was I asleep?

892
01:30:26,113 --> 01:30:28,739
Let's check it out. I'm starving to death.

893
01:30:28,740 --> 01:30:31,909
And I'm freezing. All right?

894
01:30:31,910 --> 01:30:34,745
All right. Let's move slow.

895
01:30:34,746 --> 01:30:37,212
Just look in the window.

896
01:30:38,250 --> 01:30:41,055
- I'll be right behind you.
- Oh, thanks.

897
01:31:24,046 --> 01:31:27,798
Holy Toledo. Can you believe this?

898
01:31:27,799 --> 01:31:30,701
He's from outer space.

899
01:31:58,789 --> 01:32:01,123
Oh! My friends!

900
01:32:01,124 --> 01:32:03,876
Uh, what the hell's goin' on here, Bob?

901
01:32:03,877 --> 01:32:06,504
Come on. Come on. Is wonderful.

902
01:32:06,505 --> 01:32:11,305
Look!
Wine, food. Come on. Come on.

903
01:32:11,885 --> 01:32:14,637
Sit down, please.
Sit down here, Jack, Zack.

904
01:32:17,682 --> 01:32:22,144
Sit down. Sit down.
Is wonderful. Look, huh?

905
01:32:24,356 --> 01:32:28,128
My friends. I must tell us some news.

906
01:32:29,027 --> 01:32:32,530
I "ham" in love. This is Nicoletta.

907
01:32:32,531 --> 01:32:34,240
- Hi.
- Hello.

908
01:32:34,241 --> 01:32:36,408
- How you doing?
- Fine, thank you.

909
01:32:36,409 --> 01:32:38,369
Eat, please.

910
01:32:38,370 --> 01:32:40,594
- Mm-hmm.
- Take.

911
01:32:41,873 --> 01:32:43,614
Eat.

912
01:32:45,043 --> 01:32:49,843
- She is from Italy too.
- Yes. Yes, I'm from Italy.

913
01:32:49,881 --> 01:32:52,174
- Do you know, I'm from Cesena?
- Cesena.

914
01:32:52,175 --> 01:32:53,717
- You know Cesena?
- No.

915
01:32:53,718 --> 01:32:54,802
No?

916
01:32:54,803 --> 01:32:59,603
And, uh, this place was given to me
as a present from my Uncle Luigi.

917
01:33:00,475 --> 01:33:03,060
What happened to your Uncle Luigi?

918
01:33:03,061 --> 01:33:05,479
He died.

919
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:07,366
You laugh. He died.

920
01:33:08,441 --> 01:33:10,025
What was he like?

921
01:33:10,026 --> 01:33:12,486
He was wonderful. Yes.

922
01:33:12,487 --> 01:33:17,287
He won this place playing cards,
and he was afraid to lose it again...

923
01:33:17,409 --> 01:33:19,952
so he gave me like a present.

924
01:33:19,953 --> 01:33:23,242
- Uh-huh.
- But I didn't know what to do with this.

925
01:33:23,874 --> 01:33:26,584
And one day...

926
01:33:26,585 --> 01:33:30,296
it was a very particular day...

927
01:33:30,297 --> 01:33:34,425
like out of the blue, my boyfriend left me.

928
01:33:34,426 --> 01:33:37,344
- Aw.
- Yes. It was my birthday.

929
01:33:37,345 --> 01:33:38,929
- Aw.
- Yes.

930
01:33:38,930 --> 01:33:40,931
And Uncle Luigi died.

931
01:33:40,932 --> 01:33:43,100
- Oh, no.
- All in the same day.

932
01:33:43,101 --> 01:33:47,793
So in the same day, I left Italy
and I come to live here.

933
01:33:48,190 --> 01:33:52,687
- You know?
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

934
01:33:53,111 --> 01:33:56,836
And now I have failed in love, at last.

935
01:33:57,157 --> 01:34:00,576
Ah? I have finded my new home.

936
01:34:00,577 --> 01:34:03,787
She has asked to me if I stay here...

937
01:34:03,788 --> 01:34:07,333
to live together with her forever and ever.

938
01:34:07,334 --> 01:34:10,419
- Like in a book for children.
- Yes.

939
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:11,774
No.

940
01:34:20,096 --> 01:34:23,641
Well, how did you learn
how to speak English?

941
01:34:23,642 --> 01:34:25,851
Oh, yes. I speak pretty well...

942
01:34:25,852 --> 01:34:29,188
but I know nothing
about English for restaurant.

943
01:34:29,189 --> 01:34:32,483
Like food, good plate, nice dish...

944
01:34:32,484 --> 01:34:34,466
these word I don't know.

945
01:34:35,278 --> 01:34:38,822
Well, Bob should come in handy there.
He speaks good restaurant English.

946
01:34:38,823 --> 01:34:42,499
- Yes.
- Yes, my killer.

947
01:34:46,122 --> 01:34:48,492
Mmm. Mmm!

948
01:34:54,005 --> 01:34:56,924
Well, that's just great, Bob.

949
01:34:56,925 --> 01:34:59,343
Yeah, congratulations.

950
01:34:59,344 --> 01:35:01,553
- Do you know where we are?
- Louisiana.

951
01:35:01,554 --> 01:35:03,889
- No, I know Louisiana, but...
- Yes.

952
01:35:03,890 --> 01:35:06,934
Near the border of Texas.

953
01:35:06,935 --> 01:35:11,021
Ah! You see? Texas. I knew this, eh?

954
01:35:11,022 --> 01:35:15,822
Texas near.
Remember?

955
01:35:16,069 --> 01:35:18,487
- Well, I propose a toast.
- Yes, thank you.

956
01:35:18,488 --> 01:35:21,438
To Bob and Nicoletta.

957
01:35:22,117 --> 01:35:24,410
- Oh, my friends.
- Thank you.

958
01:35:24,411 --> 01:35:25,703
Thank you.

959
01:35:44,014 --> 01:35:45,180
Ah.

960
01:35:45,181 --> 01:35:48,767
Ah, you look good
in my Uncle Luigi clothes.

961
01:35:48,768 --> 01:35:51,228
- Oh-ho.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

962
01:35:51,229 --> 01:35:52,921
Great.

963
01:35:57,527 --> 01:36:01,071
Say, uh, you don't have a car
or anything, do you?

964
01:36:01,072 --> 01:36:05,159
Car, no. But I will save to buy one
and learn to drive.

965
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:08,037
- I've only my bicycle.
- Ah.

966
01:36:08,038 --> 01:36:12,838
But there's a man who brings things
I need from town once a week or so.

967
01:36:19,090 --> 01:36:22,186
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

968
01:36:22,302 --> 01:36:25,387
- More Uncle Luigi clothes.
- Yes.

969
01:36:25,388 --> 01:36:28,290
Very sporty, Jack.

970
01:36:31,936 --> 01:36:35,022
So, but you are sure you must leave today?

971
01:36:35,023 --> 01:36:39,823
Why we cannot stay here
for some times first?

972
01:36:40,487 --> 01:36:42,988
Well, it's too dangerous out there, Bob.

973
01:36:42,989 --> 01:36:45,449
There's probably an A.P.B.
out on all of us.

974
01:36:45,450 --> 01:36:48,545
Nah, I'm sure we're gonna make it.

975
01:36:48,661 --> 01:36:53,112
Well, we're gonna have to keep going.

976
01:36:55,001 --> 01:36:57,419
At least now we know where we are.

977
01:36:57,420 --> 01:36:59,630
And where do you go now?

978
01:36:59,631 --> 01:37:02,591
- I'll probably head out west.
- Hmm.

979
01:37:02,592 --> 01:37:04,574
Out to Los Angeles.

980
01:37:06,471 --> 01:37:09,640
And you, my friend, Jack? Where do you go?

981
01:37:09,641 --> 01:37:13,685
Well, if he's going to L.A.,
I'm gonna go east. You know what I mean?

982
01:37:13,686 --> 01:37:15,476
- Yes.
- Yes.

983
01:37:21,569 --> 01:37:24,229

If you follow this road...

1011
01:39:37,747 --> 01:39:41,858
you will come to a place
where it becomes two roads.

1012
01:39:42,293 --> 01:39:47,093
On the right will go east.
On the left will go west.

1013
01:39:48,007 --> 01:39:52,719
Uh, no. On the right will go west.

1014
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:57,520
Uh, no. I'm not sure.
Anyway, there is a sign to tell you.

1015
01:39:57,934 --> 01:40:01,186
- It's all right. We'll figure it out.
- It's okay?

1016
01:40:01,187 --> 01:40:03,355
Thanks for everything.

1017
01:40:03,356 --> 01:40:05,649
- Yeah. Thank you. Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

1018
01:40:05,650 --> 01:40:07,985
- Zack.
- And, uh, take care.

1019
01:40:07,986 --> 01:40:09,403
- Yeah.
- Okay, Bob.

1020
01:40:09,404 --> 01:40:11,154
- I will.
- Bye.

1021
01:40:11,155 --> 01:40:13,156
- Good-bye, Bob.
- Jack.

1022
01:40:16,077 --> 01:40:17,527
Bye.

1023
01:40:18,413 --> 01:40:20,928
- Be careful.
- Okay.

1024
01:40:34,053 --> 01:40:38,358
Don't forget to write.

1025
01:40:38,850 --> 01:40:41,655
- Bye.
- So long.

1026
01:40:48,610 --> 01:40:51,511
Wish you were here.

1027
01:41:51,881 --> 01:41:55,412
- Well, I guess this is it.
- Yeah.

1028
01:41:56,010 --> 01:41:58,595
I don't see the sign around or anything.

1029
01:41:58,596 --> 01:42:01,973
Well, she said the one
to the right goes west.

1030
01:42:01,974 --> 01:42:03,975
She said she didn't know.

1031
01:42:03,976 --> 01:42:05,977
Look, man, don't matter to me.

1032
01:42:05,978 --> 01:42:09,731
You go whichever way you want, right?
And I'll go the other way.

1033
01:42:09,732 --> 01:42:11,024
- Yeah, right.
- All right?
