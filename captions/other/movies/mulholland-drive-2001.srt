- But this could be serious.
- No, I –

I need to sleep.

184
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,107

No, that's it.

I think you're going to enjoy
your espresso this time.

00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:50,848
I've done quite a bit of research,
knowing how hard you are to please.

217
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:53,518

A recommendation to you, Adam.

221
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:06,405
- It's not a recommendation.
- This is the girl.

What is this, Ray?

of interest in this role.

I'm sorry.
What do you mean, you know?

550
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:34,505
Somebody called. When they couldn't get you,
they told me you were as good as broke.

551
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:36,799
I didn't believe them,
so I made a few calls.

Oh, Jason thought it'd be a good idea
for me to go see the Cowboy.

and my six-shooters?

is connected to what's happening.

Sort of, funny boy.

If I tell him the meeting's on...

you'll have to go to the top
of Beachwood Canyon...

A man's attitude goes some ways...

to the way his life will be.

Is that something you might agree with?

Sure.

01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:25,541
Now, did you answer...

645
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:28,252
because that's what you thought
I wanted to hear...

646
01:07:28,336 --> 01:07:30,546
or did you think about what I said...

647
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:34,591
and answer 'cause
you truly believe that to be right?

648
01:07:35,844 --> 01:07:39,888
I agree with what you said. Truly.

649
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:43,600
What'd I say?

650
01:07:46,438 --> 01:07:50,149
That a man's attitude determines,
to a large extent, how his life will be.

651
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:54,403
So since you agree...

652
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:59,450
you must be a person
who does not care about the good life.

653
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:01,744
How's that?

654
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:07,374

and think about it.

and stop bein' a smart aleck.

01:08:31,775 --> 01:08:35,861
Look, where's this going?
What do you want me to do?

663
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:39,239
There's sometimes a buggy.

664
01:08:39,324 --> 01:08:41,700
How many drivers does a buggy have?

665
01:08:41,785 --> 01:08:43,869

666
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:47,915

I'm drivin' this buggy...

01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:52,127

you can ride along with me.

Okay.

01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:57,466
I want you to go back to work tomorrow.

the lead actress anyway.

Audition many girls for the part.

672
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:10,229
When you see the girl that was shown
to you earlier today, you will say...

01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:13,649
"This is the girl."

01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:35,003

01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:06,535

that's what you wanted.

684
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:08,537

01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:14,001
My parents are right upstairs.
They think you've left.

687
01:10:14,085 --> 01:10:18,213
- So? Surprise.
- I can call them. I can call my dad.

688
01:10:18,298 --> 01:10:20,465
But you won't.

689
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:23,886
If you're trying to blackmail me,
it's not gonna work.

690
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:25,929
You're playing a dangerous game here.

691
01:10:26,014 --> 01:10:28,390
You know what I want.
It's not that difficult.

692
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:31,977
Get out! Get out before I call my dad!

693
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:35,230
He trusts you. You're his best friend.

694
01:10:35,315 --> 01:10:37,733
This will be the end of everything.

695
01:10:37,817 --> 01:10:41,069
What about you?
What will your dad think about you?

696
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:45,490
Stop! Just stop it!
That's what you said from the beginning!

697
01:10:45,575 --> 01:10:48,911
Now, if I tell what happened,
they'll arrest you and put you in jail.

Before... I kill you.

and then I say with big emotion...

[British Accent]
Thank you, darling.

708
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:38,126
Hi there. Who are you?

709
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:41,463
Uh –

710
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:43,465
Betty?

711
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:52,891
Uh, Betty,
can I see you outside for a minute?

712
01:12:07,407 --> 01:12:10,867
- What is it, Coco?
- Your aunt called.

713
01:12:12,412 --> 01:12:13,996
I was afraid of that.

714
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,456
She wants to know
who's staying in her apartment.

715
01:12:17,959 --> 01:12:20,919
It's just for a night or two,
until she finds her own place.

716
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:23,422
I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth,
but the connection was bad...

717
01:12:23,506 --> 01:12:26,508
and her plane was leaving,
and she got it all mixed up.

718
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:28,760
I kept telling her that
it was my friend Rita...

719
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:31,263
and she kept saying
she didn't know any Ritas.

720
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:34,683
- Look at me straight, sweetie.
- Coco.

721
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:36,852
She's very nice.

722
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:38,854
Honey, you're a good kid.

723
01:12:38,938 --> 01:12:42,065
But what you're telling me
is a load of horse puckey...

724
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:44,985
even though it comes from a good place.

725
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:47,612
Now, I'm gonna trust you
to sort this thing out.

726
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:49,614
Thank you.

727
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:52,034
Don't make me out to be a sucker.

728
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:54,411
Louise Bonner said
there's trouble in there.

729
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:56,413
Remember last night?

730
01:12:56,497 --> 01:13:00,042
Well, sometimes she's wrong.

731
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:03,920
But if there is trouble, get rid of it.

732

[Door Opens, Closes]

733
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:16,224
Is everything all right?

734
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:18,226
Is it bad for you that I'm here?

735
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:21,563
No, no. Everything is A-okay.

736
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:23,857
Now, I've gotta fix that sandwich.

737
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:26,860
And my audition is in one hour!

738
01:13:26,944 --> 01:13:28,862
[Laughing]

739
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:49,633
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours.

740
01:13:49,717 --> 01:13:52,803
- And don't drink all the Coke.
- Good luck!

741
01:13:52,887 --> 01:13:56,139
Now, when I get back I'll keep
the cab waiting, so be ready to go.

742
01:13:56,224 --> 01:13:58,183
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:26,253
[Man Chuckling]

744
01:14:26,337 --> 01:14:28,213
Voilà.

745
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:30,715
Betty Elms...

746
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:34,386
I would like you to meet
Jack Tuptman, my assistant...

747
01:14:35,346 --> 01:14:37,222
Woody Katz...

748
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:39,808
who we have cast in the part of Chuck
and will do the scene with you...

749
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:43,353
Bob Brooker, our director...

750
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:46,148
and Julie Chadwick.

751
01:14:46,232 --> 01:14:48,733
Now, our surprise guest...

752
01:14:48,818 --> 01:14:50,986
Linney James.

753
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:53,488
Alas, we can't afford her
to cast our show...

754
01:14:53,573 --> 01:14:56,199
but, well, as casting agents go...

755
01:14:56,284 --> 01:14:58,743
she is the best.

756
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:02,038
Why, thank you, Wally. Hello, Betty.

757
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:03,999
Very pleased to meet you.

758
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:06,334
This is my assistant, Nicki.

759
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:10,005
Oh!
And the ever-lovely Martha.

760
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:12,757
Martha Johnson, whom you met out front.

761
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:16,887
- Hi.
- [Chuckles]

762
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:19,973
So, shall we... give it a go?

763
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:25,145
Uh, would you like a water
or a coffee before we begin?

764
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:27,147
No, I'm-I'm fine.

765
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:30,692
Well, then, let's everyone take a seat.

766
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:32,694
[Chuckles]

767
01:15:33,321 --> 01:15:34,696
Betty...

768
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:38,408
why don't you join Woody over there
and we'll play the scene.

769
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:42,954
Bob, do you have anything you wish to say?

770
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:46,041
Something to Betty before we begin?

771
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:48,793
No. It's not a contest.

772
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:54,257
The two of them, with themselves.

773
01:15:56,135 --> 01:15:59,846
So don't play it for real...

774
01:15:59,931 --> 01:16:02,891
until it gets real.

775
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:09,314
Okay.

776
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:13,902
- Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
- What?

777
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:16,154
Hey, Bobby,
I wanna play this one nice and close...

778
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:18,073
like we did with that other girl –

779
01:16:18,157 --> 01:16:20,909
What's her name? The one with
the black hair. It felt kind of good.

780
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:22,911
- What do you think?
- That's good, Woody.

781
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:25,247
Just don't rush that line again.

782
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:28,917
I told you, the line
where you say, "Before what?"

783
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:32,712
Bobby, acting is reacting.

784
01:16:32,797 --> 01:16:36,216
I just play off 'em. They all say, um...

785
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,218
"They're gonna arrest you," like that.

786
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:40,595
Then, "They'll put you in jail."
They all say it the same way.

787
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:42,889
So when they say it, I just react.

788
01:16:42,974 --> 01:16:44,432
- What's your name?
- Betty.

789
01:16:44,517 --> 01:16:49,896
Yeah, Betty.
Look, you don't rush it, I don't rush it. Okay?

790
01:16:49,981 --> 01:16:52,899
Now, we're gonna play this
nice and close.

791
01:16:52,984 --> 01:16:55,860
Just like in the movies, okay?

792
01:16:58,364 --> 01:17:00,615
Dad's best friend goes to work.

793
01:17:01,909 --> 01:17:04,035
Bob?

794
01:17:06,414 --> 01:17:09,374
And... action!

795
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:16,381
You're still here.

796
01:17:17,717 --> 01:17:21,469
I came back.
Thought that's what you wanted.

797
01:17:21,554 --> 01:17:24,806
- Nobody wants you here.
- Really?

798
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:27,517
My parents are right upstairs.

799
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:29,519
- They think you've left.
- [Chuckles]

800
01:17:29,603 --> 01:17:31,563
So, surprise!

801
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:34,983
I can call them. I can call my dad.

802
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:37,027
But you won't.

803
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:55,253
You're playing a dangerous game here.

804
01:17:57,006 --> 01:17:59,883
If you're trying to blackmail me...

805
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:02,093
it's not gonna work.

806
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:06,431
You know what I want.

807
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:08,433
It's not that difficult.

808
01:18:11,479 --> 01:18:13,438
Get out.

809
01:18:15,149 --> 01:18:18,526
Get out before I call my dad.

810
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:20,862
He trusts you.

811
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:23,114
You're his...

812
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:25,325
best friend.

813
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:31,498
This will be the end of everything.

814
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:35,794
What about you?

815
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:38,213
What'll your dad think about you?

816
01:18:38,297 --> 01:18:39,839
Don't.

817
01:18:41,092 --> 01:18:43,009
Stop it.

818
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:46,721
That's what you said from the beginning.

819
01:18:48,808 --> 01:18:50,725
If I tell them what happened...

820
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:53,436
they'll arrest you and put you in jail.

821
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:02,570
So get out of here...

822
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:04,614
before –

823
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:09,661
Before what?

824
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:30,598
Before...

825
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:32,684
I kill you.

826
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:50,452
Well, then they'd put you in jail.

827
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:00,837
I hate you.

828
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:04,716
I hate us both.

829
01:20:20,399 --> 01:20:23,485
- I'm gonna take her over there.
- Yeah, big time.

830
01:20:27,698 --> 01:20:29,616
Well, there it was.

831
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:32,994
[Chuckles]
Yeah, there it was, all right.

832
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:35,872
Baby, you've got a way with you. Really.

833
01:20:35,956 --> 01:20:37,707
Bob?

834
01:20:39,585 --> 01:20:42,462
Very good. Really.

835
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:45,173
I mean, it was forced, maybe...

836
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:49,260
but still humanistic.

837
01:20:49,345 --> 01:20:52,013
Yeah. Very good.

838
01:20:52,097 --> 01:20:54,933
Really. Really.

839
01:21:01,148 --> 01:21:03,816
Oh, I thank you, Betty...

840
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:06,528
and I really mean that sincerely.

841
01:21:06,612 --> 01:21:09,531
I mean, it was extraordinary.

842
01:21:10,783 --> 01:21:12,700
You've done your aunt proud today.

843
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:16,704
I am going to tell her that
first chance I get.

844
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:19,207
Now, you and I ...

845
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:21,209
are going to speak again very soon.

846
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:23,586
[Betty]
Thank you, Mr. Brown.

847
01:21:23,671 --> 01:21:25,588
Thank you, Wally.

848
01:21:25,673 --> 01:21:29,008
I'm sure you all have a lot to talk about.
We'll walk Betty out.

849
01:21:29,093 --> 01:21:33,012
Oh, well, yes, indeed.
And it was our pleasure, Linney.

850
01:21:33,097 --> 01:21:35,598
Now, don't you be a stranger around here.

851
01:21:35,683 --> 01:21:38,643
- We'd love to have you here.
- Come on, Betty.

852
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:40,645
Thank you again, Mr. Brown.

853
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:45,733
And it was nice meeting all of you.
Bye.

854
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:49,070
Bye.

855
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:54,409
- Wow!
- She's a slam dunk.

856
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:56,411
Where the hell did you find her?

857
01:21:56,495 --> 01:21:58,663
God, that was awful.

858
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:02,750
Not you, Betty.
You were stellar. And I mean that.

859
01:22:02,835 --> 01:22:04,544
But poor Wally.

860
01:22:04,628 --> 01:22:06,838
- He'll never get that picture made.
- No.

861
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:09,215
Wally's days were up 20 years ago.

862
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:12,427
You know Woody Katz
is only doing it for a favor.

863
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:14,596
And the cast, I hear, so far is terrible.

864
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,764
Oh, God, terrible.

865
01:22:16,849 --> 01:22:19,100
That poor old fool Wally.

866
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:23,104
He was very nice,
and he seemed so sweet.

867
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:26,149
And Wally – Mr. Brown –
is a very close friend of my aunt's, and –

868
01:22:26,233 --> 01:22:29,193
Settle down, Betty.
Don't get me wrong. I love Wally.

869
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:32,905
I ought to.
I was married to him for 10 years.

870
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:35,950
And I love actors. All actors.

871
01:22:36,035 --> 01:22:39,287
We just get a little catty sometimes.

872
01:22:39,371 --> 01:22:42,081
Now, we wanna take you across
and introduce you to a director...

873
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:44,083
who's a head above the rest.

874
01:22:44,168 --> 01:22:47,045
He's got a project you will kill.
