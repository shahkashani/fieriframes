365

You'll excuse my back, but I wanted
to get some of that written down.

366
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,701
I must have been talking for an hour.

367
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:50,271
Anything else?
Anything you haven't told me?

368
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:54,083
That's all there is.
That's the whole story.

369
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:56,753
He's been following me.
That's all there is to it.

370
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:59,447
It isn't that simple though, is it?

371
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:00,965
What do you mean?

372
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,218
He couldn't have been
in the park this afternoon,

373
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,220
or one of us men would've seen him.

374
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,788
And that night in the hallway,

375
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:11,100
you said yourself the landlady came up
a minute later, and she didn't see him?

376
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,769
What are you driving at?

377
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:16,940
It's been less than a week since you
were in a car that crashed into the river.

378
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,692
How you got out of that
no one seems to know.

379
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:22,654
But that experience must have been
a serious emotional shock.

380
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:25,865
You think I imagined all of it, don't you?
You think I'm insane?

381
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:28,243
I didn't say that. I don't mean that.

382
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:31,287
I'm a competent person.
If anything, I'm a realist.

383
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,581
I'm not given to imagining anything.

384
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,583
Hogwash.

385
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:38,044
All of us imagine things.

386
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,547
Have you ever heard two men
talking behind your back

387
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:42,820
and imagined they were talking about you?

388
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,927
Have you never imagined
you saw someone you knew,

389
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,930
and walked up to them and found
they were a perfect stranger?

390
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:52,350
- I don't see what this has to do with it.
- The point is this.

391
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,269
Our imaginations play tricks on us.

392
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:58,106
They often misinterpret
what we see and hear. Do you agree?

393
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:00,149
I suppose so.

394
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:04,028
If that can happen in ordinary times,
go a step further.

395
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:08,491
Look what can happen in a high fever,
or following a serious emotional shock.

396
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:12,287
It doesn't seem possible
that I could have imagined all of it.

397
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:16,124
Does this man, this figure,
resemble anyone you've ever known?

398
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:18,418
- An acquaintance, or your father?
- No.

399
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:22,589
- Have a boyfriend here or back home?
- No, no desire for one.

400
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:24,987
- Never?
- No.

401
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:30,722
I'm surprised to find myself
saying that, but it's true.

402
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:34,309
I have no desire for
the close company of other people.

403
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,582
Have you always felt this way?

404
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,315
I... I don't know.

405
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:43,318
Don't you want to join
in the things that other people do,

406
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:45,111
share the experiences of other people?

407
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:48,573
I don't seem capable
of being very close to people.

408
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:52,702
I do feel that perhaps I'm trying
to reach out for those other things.

409
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:55,021
Do you feel guilty wanting them?

410
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,041
I don't understand you.

411
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:01,961
I'm not a psychiatrist, and perhaps
I'm being clumsy at all this,

412
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:05,673
but I am suggesting that perhaps
this figure represents a guilt feeling.

413
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,491
Oh, that's ridiculous!

414
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:10,786
Maybe. Frankly, I don't know.

415
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:14,057
Well, I know one thing.

416
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:18,519
If my imagination is playing tricks on me,
I'm going to put a stop to it.

417
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:21,481
You're a very strong-willed person,
aren't you?

418
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:23,629
I survive, if that's what you mean.

419
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:27,362
That old pavilion out by the lake.

420
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:30,306
Somehow you associate it
with all this, don't you?

421
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:35,140
I could go out there.
I could put an end to that too.

422
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:38,978
- I could go out there...
- Now don't be hasty.

423
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:44,045
If it is all in my imagination,
I could put a stop to it.

424
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:47,006
Maybe. But at least someone
should be with you. I can't possibly...

425
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:50,110
As you say, Doctor,
I'm a person of strong will.
