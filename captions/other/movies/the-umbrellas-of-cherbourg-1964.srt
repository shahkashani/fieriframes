3
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,506
Is it finished?

4
00:02:42,911 --> 00:02:46,466
The engine still knocks
when it's cold, but that's normal.

5
00:03:13,723 --> 00:03:14,688
Foucher!

6
00:03:16,387 --> 00:03:18,874
Can you stay an extra hour?

7
00:03:20,052 --> 00:03:22,278
Tonight, it's a problem.

8
00:03:22,484 --> 00:03:24,675
But I think Pierre is free.

9
00:03:24,882 --> 00:03:28,471
Pierre, can you stay tonight?

10
00:03:30,212 --> 00:03:34,335
Check the ignition
on the gentleman's Mercedes.

11
00:03:42,337 --> 00:03:44,358
Are you coming to the game?

12
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:46,124
No, I can't.

13
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:48,155
Are you going?

14
00:03:48,566 --> 00:03:50,031
Sure.

15
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:59,419
Aubin asked me
to stay overtime... No way!

16
00:03:59,691 --> 00:04:02,451
Tonight is special!
I'm going to the theater.

17
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:04,518
What are they playing?

18
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:06,413
Carmen!

19
00:04:11,817 --> 00:04:15,406
I don't like operas.
Movies are better.

20
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,905
I'm going dancing tonight.

21
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,406
Give me a smoke.

22
00:04:24,874 --> 00:04:27,963
All that singing
gives me a pain.

23
00:04:29,438 --> 00:04:30,926
I like movies better.

24
00:04:31,136 --> 00:04:33,101
You said that already.

25
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,554
See you tomorrow.

26
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:23,127
My love... oh, my love.

27
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:26,622
Geneviève,
my little Geneviève.

28
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:29,126
Guy, I love you.

29
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:32,784
You smell like gasoline.

30
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,617
It's just another perfume.

31
00:05:37,824 --> 00:05:41,776
Guy, I love you.
Oh, Guy, I love you.

32
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:45,083
A customer. I have to run.

33
00:05:45,285 --> 00:05:48,272
See you at 8:00
in front of the theater.

34
00:05:55,712 --> 00:05:58,903
I've thought of you all day!

35
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,699
Would you like
to go dancing later?

36
00:06:02,907 --> 00:06:04,871
If you wish.

37
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,228
Can I help you?

38
00:06:14,432 --> 00:06:15,988
An umbrella.

39
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:21,224
Where were you?

40
00:06:22,027 --> 00:06:24,389
Just across the street.

41
00:06:26,358 --> 00:06:31,912
Have you decided
which kind you would like?

42
00:06:33,553 --> 00:06:36,540
An umbrella.
A black umbrella.

43
00:06:36,751 --> 00:06:40,475
Geneviève, show the gentleman
the umbrellas.

44
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:03,461
Is that you, Guy?

45
00:07:04,165 --> 00:07:06,187
Good evening, Aunt Elise.

46
00:07:07,096 --> 00:07:09,686
Good evening, my boy.

47
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,478
How are your legs?

48
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,611
Fine, my boy.

49
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,707
What are you up to?

50
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,336
I'm hungry.

51
00:07:31,746 --> 00:07:34,210
You'll spoil your appetite.

52
00:07:34,511 --> 00:07:36,771
I do what I please.

53
00:07:39,807 --> 00:07:43,827
Calm down and talk to me.

54
00:07:44,904 --> 00:07:47,266
I haven't much time.

55
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,487
You seem very nervous.

56
00:07:53,964 --> 00:07:55,589
I'm going out.

57
00:07:55,796 --> 00:07:56,954
Alone?

58
00:07:57,162 --> 00:08:00,092
None of your business.

59
00:08:01,226 --> 00:08:02,486
I think it is.

60
00:08:02,692 --> 00:08:04,418
With a girl.

61
00:08:04,623 --> 00:08:06,145
Do you love her?

62
00:08:06,355 --> 00:08:07,513
It could be.

63
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,118
Tell me the truth.

64
00:08:09,387 --> 00:08:10,818
Yes, I love her.

65
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,678
What's the matter?
You're crying!

66
00:08:12,884 --> 00:08:13,907
No, I'm not.

67
00:08:14,117 --> 00:08:16,082
I can see that you are.

68
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:19,574
Is it because you're lonely?

69
00:08:20,646 --> 00:08:23,576
I'm not lonely.
I have my books.

70
00:08:23,844 --> 00:08:26,308
Madeleine will give me my shot.

71
00:08:26,975 --> 00:08:28,939
She will keep me company.

72
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,400
What, then?

73
00:08:30,606 --> 00:08:34,228
Maybe happiness makes me sad.

74
00:08:34,603 --> 00:08:35,999
That's silly.

75
00:08:37,102 --> 00:08:39,725
You big brute,
you're messing up my hair.

76
00:08:44,496 --> 00:08:46,824
Good evening, Guy.

77
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:48,458
Good evening, Madeleine.

78
00:08:51,025 --> 00:08:52,217
You are sad.

79
00:08:53,657 --> 00:08:57,087
You seem happy.

80
00:08:59,486 --> 00:09:00,950
Does it show?

81
00:09:21,504 --> 00:09:22,799
I had a terrible time...

82
00:09:23,003 --> 00:09:24,025
Why?

83
00:09:24,935 --> 00:09:28,262
Persuading Mother.
It was getting late,

84
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:31,225
and the seamstress was late.

85
00:09:32,297 --> 00:09:33,455
Look.

86
00:09:34,495 --> 00:09:39,514
Careful, it's still full of pins.

87
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,413
You know,

88
00:10:43,848 --> 00:10:46,676
I think she suspects something.

89
00:10:47,678 --> 00:10:48,575
Who?

90
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:50,470
Mother.

91
00:10:50,676 --> 00:10:54,629
When I said I was going
to the theater with Cécile,

92
00:10:56,539 --> 00:11:00,333
she gave me a funny look.

93
00:11:00,603 --> 00:11:02,067
What kind of a look?

94
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:03,359
Like that.

95
00:11:03,568 --> 00:11:06,998
She knows quite well
that Cécile hates shows,

96
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:09,128
and since I'm a very bad liar...

97
00:11:09,397 --> 00:11:10,986
That's what you say!

98
00:11:11,196 --> 00:11:14,387
I assure you, I'm very awkward.

99
00:11:14,593 --> 00:11:17,183
I stammered and blushed

100
00:11:17,391 --> 00:11:20,185
and immediately
changed the subject.

101
00:11:25,153 --> 00:11:26,811
Something squeezed.

102
00:11:27,551 --> 00:11:29,107
Something?

103
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,174
Lemon.

104
00:11:31,382 --> 00:11:32,869
The same.

105
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:46,770
Do you love me?

106
00:11:49,369 --> 00:11:51,163
A mambo. Let's go!

107
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,494
I should have changed shoes.

108
00:12:11,987 --> 00:12:14,508
We'll have children.

109
00:12:14,952 --> 00:12:18,007
I'll call my daughter Françoise.

110
00:12:18,217 --> 00:12:19,647
And if it's a boy?

111
00:12:19,849 --> 00:12:21,643
It will be a girl.

112
00:12:21,848 --> 00:12:25,471
We've always had girls
in the family.

113
00:12:32,806 --> 00:12:33,793
One o'clock.

114
00:12:34,005 --> 00:12:39,956
If Mother's not asleep,
what a scene there will be.

115
00:12:40,334 --> 00:12:43,662
I should wear makeup,
don't you think?

116
00:12:44,665 --> 00:12:47,595
You're lovely as you are.

117
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:50,121
A little bit here.

118
00:12:50,328 --> 00:12:51,156
Where?

119
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,256
There.

120
00:12:59,688 --> 00:13:02,584
We'll sell umbrellas.

121
00:13:03,152 --> 00:13:05,810
No, not umbrellas.

122
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,143
We'll sell the shop.

123
00:13:08,348 --> 00:13:11,778
We'll buy a gas station.

124
00:13:11,979 --> 00:13:13,773
Why? What an idea!

125
00:13:14,777 --> 00:13:18,468
All white, with an office.
You'll see.

126
00:13:18,842 --> 00:13:22,272
You'll smell like gasoline all day.

127
00:13:22,505 --> 00:13:23,868
What happiness...

128
00:13:25,603 --> 00:13:27,761
We'll be very happy...

129
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:31,690
And we'll stay in love...

130
00:13:42,392 --> 00:13:43,913
You haven't told your mother?

131
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:45,384
Not yet.

132
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:47,611
Why? You're a coward.

133
00:13:48,788 --> 00:13:51,946
You mustn't be angry.

134
00:13:52,152 --> 00:13:55,082
I know what she'll say.

135
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,846
What?

136
00:13:57,448 --> 00:14:01,401
"My little girl, you're crazy.
Thinking of marriage at your age!"

137
00:14:02,745 --> 00:14:05,504
My little girl, you're crazy.
Thinking of marriage at 16!

138
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,333
Seventeen.

139
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:07,507
In love!

140
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,332
Am I too ugly or too stupid?

141
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,368
No, you're not ugly.
You're not the fairest of them all,

142
00:14:12,571 --> 00:14:14,694
but you're neither ugly nor dumb.

143
00:14:14,903 --> 00:14:17,026
The thing is,
you have plenty of time.

144
00:14:17,235 --> 00:14:19,257
You think you're in love.

145
00:14:19,867 --> 00:14:22,763
But love is something different.

146
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,256
You don't just fall

147
00:14:26,762 --> 00:14:30,157
in love with a face

148
00:14:30,426 --> 00:14:33,254
that you've seen in the street.

149
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:40,546
He's a young man
I've met several times,

150
00:14:40,752 --> 00:14:43,478
and he loves me.

151
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:47,476
We want to get married.

152
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:51,135
You don't answer?

153
00:14:52,777 --> 00:14:54,901
I'm flabbergasted.

154
00:14:55,109 --> 00:14:59,562
I went with him
to the theater last night.

155
00:14:59,772 --> 00:15:02,861
Great!
First you lie to me,

156
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,329
then you admit it
without the slightest shame.

157
00:15:06,668 --> 00:15:10,325
There's no shame
in wanting to get married.

158
00:15:10,932 --> 00:15:14,123
At your age, there is.
Well, no...

159
00:15:16,661 --> 00:15:19,648
You're just a little girl.

160
00:15:20,992 --> 00:15:23,979
You know nothing.

161
00:15:26,021 --> 00:15:30,212
Well, what you've taught me
sure won't take me very far.

162
00:15:30,418 --> 00:15:32,938
When I married your father,
I knew nothing.

163
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:35,046
That's nothing to brag about.

164
00:15:35,248 --> 00:15:36,644
The paint shop, please?

165
00:15:36,847 --> 00:15:38,142
Next door.

166
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:40,510
How old is he?

167
00:15:40,711 --> 00:15:42,176
Twenty.

168
00:15:42,377 --> 00:15:46,601
Of course, he hasn't done
his military service yet.

169
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,766
He lives with his godmother,

170
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:57,962
the lady who raised him.

171
00:15:59,398 --> 00:16:01,158
I'm all he has,

172
00:16:01,396 --> 00:16:03,293
and you'll see,

173
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:06,424
he's very handsome.

174
00:16:07,726 --> 00:16:09,690
I'll see nothing of the kind.

175
00:16:09,891 --> 00:16:11,083
But Mother...

176
00:16:11,556 --> 00:16:13,612
Go upstairs to the apartment.

177
00:16:13,888 --> 00:16:18,908
It's time to fix lunch.

178
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,635
Geneviève!

179
00:16:44,035 --> 00:16:45,125
We're ruined!

180
00:16:45,966 --> 00:16:47,760
You always exaggerate.

181
00:16:48,264 --> 00:16:51,989
I owe 80,000 francs by the 15th.
Is that funny?

182
00:16:52,528 --> 00:16:54,322
And if you don't pay?

183
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,453
They'll seize our property.

184
00:16:56,659 --> 00:16:57,885
I'll get a job.

185
00:16:58,091 --> 00:16:59,078
What sort of a job?

186
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,880
Anything.

187
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:03,153
Post office or city hall?

188
00:17:03,354 --> 00:17:04,875
Why not?

189
00:17:09,783 --> 00:17:13,906
You understand, if I get married,

190
00:17:14,114 --> 00:17:18,134
Guy and I will work,
and we'll help you.

191
00:17:18,444 --> 00:17:20,238
But, my little girl,

192
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:23,632
it's out of the question
for you to marry.

193
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,464
Take that away.
You're in my way.

194
00:17:29,104 --> 00:17:31,193
Anyway, what can he do?

195
00:17:31,402 --> 00:17:34,797
Can he support you?
Raise children?

196
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:38,687
He's not rich.
We'll live modestly,

197
00:17:38,897 --> 00:17:42,055
and we won't have
children right away.

198
00:17:42,994 --> 00:17:44,788
No, but one at least.

199
00:17:46,225 --> 00:17:49,552
He's not the one
who will pay my taxes.

200
00:17:49,756 --> 00:17:52,515
There isn't a penny left in the till.

201
00:17:52,721 --> 00:17:54,515
Sell your jewels.

202
00:17:54,719 --> 00:17:55,616
My jewels? Never!

203
00:17:55,819 --> 00:17:58,010
What good are they?
You don't even look at them.

204
00:17:58,216 --> 00:18:00,340
What if there's an emergency?

205
00:18:00,948 --> 00:18:04,673
Isn't what's happening
an emergency?

206
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:09,003
Impossible!
If I sold my jewels, I'd feel...

207
00:18:09,443 --> 00:18:13,032
stripped and naked.

208
00:18:13,473 --> 00:18:15,028
Find something else.

209
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:17,430
Something else?
We have nothing.

210
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,859
Then sell the shop.

211
00:18:20,069 --> 00:18:22,260
Stupid!
What will we live on?

212
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:25,329
Then again, a jewel is just a jewel.

213
00:18:30,394 --> 00:18:31,859
Should I change my hairstyle?

214
00:18:34,592 --> 00:18:36,318
My engagement ring...

215
00:18:38,856 --> 00:18:40,480
It's atrocious.

216
00:18:43,086 --> 00:18:44,482
This bracelet...

217
00:18:47,116 --> 00:18:49,081
I could never wear it.

218
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,845
Nobody will want that.

219
00:18:55,444 --> 00:18:57,170
What about your necklace?

220
00:18:57,376 --> 00:18:59,000
My necklace? You think?

221
00:18:59,441 --> 00:19:02,735
That'd be a crime.
No, I'll never part with it.

222
00:19:03,572 --> 00:19:06,002
Anyway, it's probably fake.

223
00:19:06,204 --> 00:19:10,156
Come on!
Then again, it's not that pretty.

224
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:15,690
This afternoon
we'll go see Mr. Dubourg.

225
00:19:15,897 --> 00:19:19,327
Then I'll have my hair done.

226
00:19:33,552 --> 00:19:35,482
How beautiful!

227
00:19:36,249 --> 00:19:38,305
Truly marvelous.

228
00:19:38,581 --> 00:19:39,773
Isn't it?

229
00:19:40,214 --> 00:19:42,973
This is an impressive stone...

230
00:19:44,377 --> 00:19:46,638
if I may say so.

231
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,866
Here are

232
00:19:52,672 --> 00:19:56,193
rubies, sapphires, emeralds.

233
00:19:56,803 --> 00:19:59,289
Ali Baba's cave.

234
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,296
The jewels...

235
00:20:02,565 --> 00:20:03,798
of Sleeping Beauty.

236
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:06,660
Of Sleeping Beauty.

237
00:20:07,462 --> 00:20:11,152
Hello, Mrs. Emery.
Hello, Miss Geneviève.

238
00:20:13,191 --> 00:20:16,178
Hello, Mr. Dubourg.

239
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:18,015
Will you excuse me?

240
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,947
Please.

241
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,611
The young lady

242
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:28,510
has become very pretty.

243
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,501
It's been such a long time

244
00:20:33,377 --> 00:20:35,898
since I've had the pleasure.

245
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,805
But what can I do for you?

246
00:20:40,838 --> 00:20:44,132
You may speak frankly.

247
00:20:45,102 --> 00:20:49,054
We are in an embarrassing situation.

248
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,654
Geneviève helps me
as much as she can.

249
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,920
It has nothing to do with her.

250
00:20:55,429 --> 00:20:57,791
But I have heavy expenses
and I thought...

251
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,156
Well, I have a payment to meet

252
00:21:01,358 --> 00:21:04,617
and if I don't,
consequences will be dire.

253
00:21:04,856 --> 00:21:08,217
So I come to you as to my savior.

254
00:21:11,118 --> 00:21:13,742
I hesitated a long time,
and Geneviève,

255
00:21:13,949 --> 00:21:16,539
who is the voice
of wisdom and reason,

256
00:21:17,314 --> 00:21:19,074
persuaded me.

257
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:20,769
It breaks my heart

258
00:21:21,177 --> 00:21:24,266
to be forced to give up

259
00:21:24,476 --> 00:21:27,565
this jewel, which to me
represents...

260
00:21:30,871 --> 00:21:32,960
I understand, dear madame,

261
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:35,463
but my business involves risks

262
00:21:35,668 --> 00:21:37,565
and I've already taken too many.

263
00:21:37,766 --> 00:21:40,992
At best, I can put
your necklace up for sale,

264
00:21:41,198 --> 00:21:46,388
but for much less
than its real worth.

265
00:21:48,358 --> 00:21:51,811
I cannot buy it myself.

266
00:21:52,689 --> 00:21:55,881
Couldn't you at least
give me an advance?

267
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,551
Nothing, I told you.
We can do nothing.

268
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:10,138
Don't insist, Mother.

269
00:22:12,242 --> 00:22:13,934
This is a disaster.

270
00:22:15,773 --> 00:22:20,862
Excuse me, but I'm interested.
I'll buy your jewel.

271
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:24,259
I can save you
from your predicament.

272
00:22:24,967 --> 00:22:27,295
Allow me to introduce myself.

273
00:22:27,598 --> 00:22:31,721
Roland Cassard, diamond dealer.

274
00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:33,087
But, sir...

275
00:22:33,295 --> 00:22:35,191
Don't worry, madame,

276
00:22:36,726 --> 00:22:39,247
I'm no philanthropist.

277
00:22:40,457 --> 00:22:44,012
I'll easily sell this necklace

278
00:22:44,387 --> 00:22:47,613
in Paris or London,

279
00:22:47,818 --> 00:22:50,680
where I often go on business.

280
00:22:51,649 --> 00:22:54,511
I don't know if I should.

281
00:22:55,579 --> 00:22:57,544
Please, I'm serious.

282
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:02,731
I'm ashamed,
and at the same time, delighted.

283
00:23:03,042 --> 00:23:05,870
I don't have enough cash with me.

284
00:23:06,738 --> 00:23:08,532
I can give you a check.

285
00:23:08,737 --> 00:23:10,201
There's no hurry.

286
00:23:10,403 --> 00:23:12,594
Could you come tomorrow

287
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,094
to my shop?

288
00:23:16,365 --> 00:23:19,920
"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg."

289
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:24,016
I'm always there.

290
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:27,482
See you tomorrow.

291
00:23:44,946 --> 00:23:46,672
What time is it?

292
00:23:47,411 --> 00:23:49,035
6:15.

293
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:52,398
How come he isn't here yet?

294
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:54,572
He might be a crook.

295
00:23:55,239 --> 00:23:57,100
He could have been leading you on.

296
00:23:57,737 --> 00:23:59,100
Don't imagine things.

297
00:23:59,303 --> 00:24:01,097
What's the matter with you?

298
00:24:01,301 --> 00:24:02,789
Nothing, Mother.

299
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,094
Then be quiet.

300
00:24:07,397 --> 00:24:09,225
I'm going to see Guy.

301
00:24:09,629 --> 00:24:13,423
I forbid you to see that boy.
Stay here.

302
00:24:13,627 --> 00:24:16,352
I wouldn't want to be disrespectful...

303
00:24:16,991 --> 00:24:18,615
Well, that's good!

304
00:24:18,823 --> 00:24:19,788
But I'm going.

305
00:24:19,989 --> 00:24:21,215
You'll stay here.

306
00:24:25,151 --> 00:24:27,843
Anyway, Mr. Cassard
will be here soon,

307
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:30,673
and I want you to be present.

308
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,675
Why?

309
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,936
Because!

310
00:24:33,412 --> 00:24:37,933
If he's a crook, as you said,
we'd better face him together.

311
00:24:38,142 --> 00:24:41,004
You think we'll be smart enough?

312
00:24:41,573 --> 00:24:43,868
I don't know, but stay here.

313
00:24:44,072 --> 00:24:45,594
I can't.

314
00:24:45,804 --> 00:24:50,063
Don't leave. I don't want you
to leave. Geneviève!

315
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:08,380
I had given up waiting for you.

316
00:25:08,589 --> 00:25:09,884
Are you crying?

317
00:25:10,087 --> 00:25:13,710
It's nothing. Sometimes
I don't have the courage

318
00:25:13,918 --> 00:25:17,313
to deal with my troubles
and my debts.

319
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:20,345
Am I not here to help you?

320
00:25:20,947 --> 00:25:22,741
It's most kind of you.

321
00:25:24,045 --> 00:25:27,032
I just saw Miss Geneviève.

322
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:28,871
I would have liked...

323
00:25:29,341 --> 00:25:30,670
She's gone out.

324
00:25:30,873 --> 00:25:34,826
The life we lead
is so sad for a young girl.

325
00:25:35,037 --> 00:25:36,831
This dreary shop...

326
00:25:38,501 --> 00:25:40,398
I no longer amuse her,

327
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,360
and I fear she'll become depressed.

328
00:25:44,564 --> 00:25:46,392
You see, she's bored.

329
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,986
Would you like some tea?

330
00:25:52,824 --> 00:25:54,221
With pleasure.

331
00:25:58,187 --> 00:26:01,015
We've just had
a terrible fight about you.

332
00:26:01,219 --> 00:26:02,479
About me?

333
00:26:02,685 --> 00:26:05,171
She wanted to go out.
I didn't want her to.

334
00:26:05,383 --> 00:26:09,779
We quarreled. We're so lonely
since my husband died.

335
00:26:09,979 --> 00:26:11,444
Maybe you should...

336
00:26:12,245 --> 00:26:14,936
I don't know...
take her to a show.

337
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:16,467
Maybe.

338
00:26:23,471 --> 00:26:25,458
Will you come to dinner tomorrow?

339
00:26:26,035 --> 00:26:28,522
Geneviève would be happy
to see you.

340
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:33,194
Impossible. I must leave tonight.

341
00:26:34,696 --> 00:26:38,489
I'm going back to Paris,
and tomorrow I'm off to London.

342
00:26:39,326 --> 00:26:42,154
Here's the money I promised you.

343
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:46,643
Give Geneviève my best regards,

344
00:26:47,121 --> 00:26:49,608
and I shall not fail

345
00:26:50,619 --> 00:26:53,412
to visit you

346
00:26:54,782 --> 00:26:58,473
on my next trip.

347
00:27:23,296 --> 00:27:26,385
I was so afraid
I wouldn't find you.

348
00:27:26,827 --> 00:27:30,120
I'm so happy to be with you!

349
00:27:31,357 --> 00:27:34,617
Now I'm laughing
because I realize

350
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:38,611
how foolish I am
when I'm alone.

351
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:43,211
I talked to Mother
about our marriage.

352
00:27:44,115 --> 00:27:46,874
Of course, she said I'm crazy.

353
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,532
And tonight
she forbade me to see you.

354
00:27:52,909 --> 00:27:56,361
You see, I was so afraid.

355
00:27:58,638 --> 00:28:03,260
I'd go anywhere,
I'd never see Mother again,

356
00:28:04,168 --> 00:28:06,291
rather than lose you.

357
00:28:11,397 --> 00:28:14,918
We'll marry in secret.

358
00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:20,614
It doesn't matter anymore now.

359
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:23,583
We have plenty of time.

360
00:28:25,087 --> 00:28:29,039
I just received my draft notice
this morning.

361
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:32,609
I'll be gone for two years.

362
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:38,702
So we'll have to talk
about marriage later.

363
00:28:39,744 --> 00:28:43,265
With the war in Algeria,

364
00:28:44,107 --> 00:28:48,400
it will be a long time
before I can come back.

365
00:28:54,434 --> 00:28:59,022
But I'll never be able

366
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:02,023
to live without you.

367
00:29:02,628 --> 00:29:05,820
I won't be able to.

368
00:29:06,225 --> 00:29:09,655
Don't go. I'll die.

369
00:29:10,222 --> 00:29:13,051
I'll hide you...

370
00:29:13,853 --> 00:29:17,374
and keep you...

371
00:29:18,017 --> 00:29:23,174
but, my love, don't leave me.

372
00:29:26,445 --> 00:29:32,033
You know it's not possible.

373
00:29:32,241 --> 00:29:36,035
I won't leave you.

374
00:29:36,738 --> 00:29:41,190
My love, I have to go.

375
00:29:42,034 --> 00:29:45,191
I want you to know

376
00:29:45,699 --> 00:29:49,185
that I'll think only of you.

377
00:29:49,928 --> 00:29:55,187
And I know
that you'll wait for me.

378
00:29:59,822 --> 00:30:04,807
Two years...
Two years of our life!

379
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:12,211
Don't cry, I beg you.

380
00:30:16,144 --> 00:30:20,267
Two years...
No, I can't face it.

381
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:24,436
Calm down.
We have so little time left.

382
00:30:25,372 --> 00:30:28,802
So little time, my love,
and we mustn't waste it.

383
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:36,755
We must try to be happy.

384
00:30:37,396 --> 00:30:42,757
Of our last moments
we must keep a memory

385
00:30:42,992 --> 00:30:44,820
more beautiful than anything.

386
00:30:45,624 --> 00:30:50,678
A memory to help us live.

387
00:30:51,287 --> 00:30:57,079
I'm so afraid when I'm alone.

388
00:30:57,516 --> 00:31:00,775
We'll be together again,
and we'll be stronger.

389
00:31:01,979 --> 00:31:04,409
You'll meet other women...

390
00:31:04,711 --> 00:31:07,574
you'll forget me.

391
00:31:08,176 --> 00:31:10,662
I will love you

392
00:31:11,306 --> 00:31:15,668
until the end of my life.

393
00:31:17,135 --> 00:31:19,100
Guy, I love you.

394
00:31:19,301 --> 00:31:22,458
Don't leave me.

395
00:31:32,492 --> 00:31:36,615
My love, don't leave me.

396
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:49,243
Come, my love.

397
00:32:15,562 --> 00:32:16,959
Is that you, Guy?

398
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:21,949
Good evening, Aunt Elise.
Are you in bed?

399
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,784
I don't feel too well.

400
00:32:34,949 --> 00:32:37,209
Is there anything you want?

401
00:32:38,147 --> 00:32:42,735
Nothing.
I just need to rest.

402
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:48,102
Good night, my little one.

403
00:33:05,562 --> 00:33:07,049
I'm afraid...

404
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:13,749
I love you.

405
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:35,738
Where were you?

406
00:33:36,673 --> 00:33:37,899
With Guy.

407
00:33:43,169 --> 00:33:44,395
What did you do?

408
00:33:58,025 --> 00:34:02,045
He's leaving.
He'll be away for two years.

409
00:34:03,156 --> 00:34:07,608
I can't live without him.
I'll die.

410
00:34:08,319 --> 00:34:12,271
Stop crying. Look at me.

411
00:34:13,248 --> 00:34:16,111
People only die of love in movies.

412
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:19,309
It's too cruel...

413
00:34:24,074 --> 00:34:27,526
Separation is cruel, that's true.

414
00:34:28,638 --> 00:34:32,761
But time fixes a lot of things.

415
00:34:33,634 --> 00:34:37,757
You speak of love.
What do you know of love?

416
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:42,521
Are you sure of your feelings?

417
00:34:43,727 --> 00:34:48,588
Mother, can't you see
how unhappy I am?

418
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:54,319
I know, darling, I know.

419
00:34:54,687 --> 00:34:57,912
I have also loved, and fought...

420
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:01,744
and suffered.
You should listen to me.

421
00:35:01,948 --> 00:35:03,243
I do listen to you.

422
00:35:03,447 --> 00:35:06,434
Isn't it better to wait?

423
00:35:07,778 --> 00:35:13,105
Two years from now,
perhaps you will have forgotten Guy.

424
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:19,492
No... I'll never forget him.

425
00:35:20,103 --> 00:35:23,896
If you still love him
when he returns, you'll see.

426
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:28,393
You must believe me.
You must calm down

427
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:31,988
and get this affair
out of your mind.

428
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:36,614
Have you had dinner?

429
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:38,720
Yes, Mother.

430
00:35:40,922 --> 00:35:42,477
Have some fruit.

431
00:35:44,819 --> 00:35:48,908
You need distraction.
Go out and live a little.

432
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:51,612
It's not difficult.

433
00:35:58,743 --> 00:36:02,298
You're young, pretty and witty.

434
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:06,692
You'll make friends
your age... or older.

435
00:36:06,904 --> 00:36:10,629
Mr. Cassard came by this evening.

436
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:13,691
He was sorry he missed you.

437
00:36:14,032 --> 00:36:17,689
I'm certain
he could give you good advice.

438
00:36:18,462 --> 00:36:22,415
I can do without his advice.

439
00:36:22,793 --> 00:36:26,416
You're wrong!
For me, he's the kind of man...

440
00:36:26,624 --> 00:36:28,815
Don't bore me with his kind!

441
00:36:31,287 --> 00:36:33,410
You look terrible.

442
00:36:34,152 --> 00:36:35,946
Leave me alone, Mother.

443
00:36:36,317 --> 00:36:40,770
Give me a kiss at least.
Have faith. You'll see.

444
00:37:00,533 --> 00:37:03,986
Look at me, my boy.

445
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:07,959
When you return, I don't know

446
00:37:08,162 --> 00:37:12,285
if I shall still be alive.

447
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:15,149
But Elise!

448
00:37:15,356 --> 00:37:18,945
Don't say "but."
I've had a good life,

449
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:22,777
and I can leave it without regrets.

450
00:37:23,185 --> 00:37:26,172
Nonsense! Right, Madeleine?

451
00:37:27,116 --> 00:37:30,840
Of course.
She's better already.

452
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,941
I'll meet death before you do.

453
00:37:36,242 --> 00:37:39,468
It's the army, not the war.

454
00:37:40,473 --> 00:37:43,959
Before you go,
I want you to know

455
00:37:44,171 --> 00:37:47,760
that everything I have will be yours.

456
00:37:48,201 --> 00:37:50,960
Don't ever forget me.

457
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:54,857
Write me from time to time.

458
00:37:55,396 --> 00:37:59,291
Madeleine will keep you informed.

459
00:38:00,293 --> 00:38:03,450
Farewell, my little one.

460
00:39:01,684 --> 00:39:06,773
My love, I'll wait for you

461
00:39:07,114 --> 00:39:10,374
all my life.

462
00:39:10,578 --> 00:39:12,804
I'll think only of you.

463
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:15,531
Stay. Don't go,

464
00:39:15,741 --> 00:39:18,762
I beg you.

465
00:39:19,572 --> 00:39:23,467
Stay, my love.

466
00:39:23,936 --> 00:39:28,127
It's not time yet.

467
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:31,728
I'm leaving now.

468
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:35,690
Don't look at me.

469
00:39:46,053 --> 00:39:48,347
I can't.

470
00:39:49,951 --> 00:39:51,882
I can't.

471
00:40:12,336 --> 00:40:14,392
My love...

472
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,462
I love you...

473
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:19,028
My love...

474
00:40:19,197 --> 00:40:22,922
I love you... I love you...

475
00:40:24,593 --> 00:40:26,854
My love...

476
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:31,085
I love you... I love you... I love you...

478
00:41:44,373 --> 00:41:45,429
Well?

479
00:41:45,804 --> 00:41:46,962
Well what?

480
00:41:47,737 --> 00:41:49,531
You're so pale.

481
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:56,493
What did the doctor say?

482
00:41:57,564 --> 00:42:02,492
Practically nothing.
That I need rest.

483
00:42:04,392 --> 00:42:08,254
You didn't need
to see a doctor for that.

484
00:42:08,456 --> 00:42:13,181
I could have told you myself.
What else?

485
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:16,506
He gave me a prescription.

486
00:42:16,884 --> 00:42:19,780
Sedatives, tonics and stuff.

487
00:42:20,615 --> 00:42:24,908
Stuff!
Then it can't be very serious.

488
00:42:25,111 --> 00:42:28,132
You see, Geneviève,
if the shop were doing better,

489
00:42:28,343 --> 00:42:31,307
I'd be the happiest of women.

490
00:42:34,372 --> 00:42:36,598
It's freezing.

491
00:42:39,035 --> 00:42:42,828
Do you know whom I met in town?

492
00:42:43,266 --> 00:42:46,230
You'll never guess.
Roland Cassard!

493
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:47,886
What do you say to that?

494
00:42:47,996 --> 00:42:50,653
What do you want me to say?

495
00:42:50,861 --> 00:42:52,916
He's incredibly nice.

496
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:56,214
We talked for over an hour
this morning.

497
00:42:56,423 --> 00:42:59,478
He's back from the US.
What a man!

498
00:42:59,754 --> 00:43:03,979
He told me a thousand stories.
I invited him to dinner.

499
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,269
What's the matter, Geneviève?

500
00:43:13,478 --> 00:43:16,306
Nothing, I'm just tired.

501
00:43:18,008 --> 00:43:21,267
That's no reason
for sulking like that.

502
00:43:21,472 --> 00:43:24,368
You may be tired,
but you're not dying.

503
00:43:24,571 --> 00:43:29,193
It's not the fatigue
that saddens me. It's his silence.

504
00:43:29,401 --> 00:43:32,422
Guy left two months ago.

505
00:43:32,631 --> 00:43:34,459
He's only written me once.

506
00:43:34,664 --> 00:43:37,128
Don't start that again!

507
00:43:37,662 --> 00:43:41,217
If I knew where he was,
I could write him.

508
00:43:42,658 --> 00:43:46,748
I'm sure they've sent him
to some dangerous place

509
00:43:46,955 --> 00:43:48,681
where he's risking his life.

510
00:43:48,987 --> 00:43:50,349
It's simpler than that.

511
00:43:50,553 --> 00:43:52,075
Simpler than what?

512
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:53,510
He's forgotten you.

513
00:43:53,717 --> 00:43:55,511
You don't know what you're saying!

514
00:43:55,882 --> 00:43:58,710
He doesn't think about you.
If he did, he would write.

515
00:43:59,047 --> 00:44:02,272
One can write,
no matter how far away one is.

516
00:44:08,541 --> 00:44:10,801
It's nothing.

517
00:44:11,605 --> 00:44:13,933
I got so frightened.

518
00:44:14,136 --> 00:44:16,828
I suddenly saw Guy laughing

519
00:44:17,634 --> 00:44:19,327
with another woman.

520
00:44:21,632 --> 00:44:26,890
Sit down.
I'll close the shop.

521
00:44:35,421 --> 00:44:37,409
You're hiding something.

522
00:44:37,853 --> 00:44:39,182
I'm not.

523
00:44:40,751 --> 00:44:43,648
It's serious, isn't it?

524
00:44:46,847 --> 00:44:50,867
I'm pregnant, Mother.

525
00:44:51,078 --> 00:44:54,473
This is horrible.
Pregnant by Guy?

526
00:44:55,075 --> 00:44:57,335
How could this happen?

527
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:01,026
Same as with everyone else.

528
00:45:01,238 --> 00:45:03,963
Don't joke about it.
This is serious.

529
00:45:04,336 --> 00:45:06,323
What are we going to do?

530
00:45:06,734 --> 00:45:08,994
What do you mean?

531
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:11,357
With the child?

532
00:45:11,564 --> 00:45:12,654
Bring it up.

533
00:45:12,929 --> 00:45:14,121
What will we say?

534
00:45:14,329 --> 00:45:15,884
To whom?

535
00:45:16,094 --> 00:45:19,149
I don't know...
our neighbors, our friends!

536
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:21,788
We have no friends.

537
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:25,385
And you never speak
to the neighbors.

538
00:45:26,754 --> 00:45:29,445
And Roland Cassard
is coming to dinner tonight!

539
00:45:30,151 --> 00:45:33,842
We'll have to make him feel welcome
and put up a good front.

540
00:45:34,049 --> 00:45:37,103
The way you look...
pregnant...

541
00:45:37,313 --> 00:45:39,369
You don't need to tell him.

542
00:45:39,578 --> 00:45:40,804
Be quiet.

543
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:42,702
It makes me shiver...

544
00:45:43,675 --> 00:45:46,435
just to think of it.

545
00:45:46,906 --> 00:45:50,301
Go upstairs and lie down.

546
00:45:52,569 --> 00:45:55,261
I feel just fine.

547
00:45:56,233 --> 00:45:59,356
Don't argue. Obey me.

548
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:07,087
I'll cook dinner myself.

549
00:46:07,792 --> 00:46:09,552
Don't worry.

550
00:46:39,137 --> 00:46:42,897
Maybe you need some rest.

551
00:46:43,101 --> 00:46:47,224
Yes, Geneviève has been
overdoing it somewhat

552
00:46:47,698 --> 00:46:48,789
lately.

553
00:46:49,197 --> 00:46:50,821
She's a bit pale.

554
00:46:51,529 --> 00:46:55,424
Why don't you go live
in the country?

555
00:46:56,359 --> 00:47:00,981
The situation
in which we find ourselves

556
00:47:01,189 --> 00:47:04,812
is such that we cannot,
for the time being,

557
00:47:05,019 --> 00:47:07,643
take any rest.

558
00:47:08,017 --> 00:47:11,038
Geneviève wouldn't go alone,

559
00:47:11,249 --> 00:47:15,974
and I can't leave the shop.

560
00:47:16,778 --> 00:47:18,538
There's no way out of it.

561
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:23,137
So you can't be separated?

562
00:47:23,939 --> 00:47:28,698
We've practically never
been parted.

563
00:47:30,468 --> 00:47:33,058
I haven't found the bean.

564
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,753
I have it.

565
00:47:36,132 --> 00:47:41,527
You must pick a king
and make a wish.

566
00:47:41,727 --> 00:47:44,123
I have no choice.

567
00:47:45,725 --> 00:47:47,916
You are my king.

568
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:49,848
Thank you, Geneviève.

569
00:47:50,055 --> 00:47:52,611
Put this crown on.

570
00:47:54,053 --> 00:47:58,107
Put it on, Geneviève,
like he asked you to.

571
00:48:10,807 --> 00:48:13,363
You look like

572
00:48:13,573 --> 00:48:17,559
the <i>Virgin with Child</i>
I saw in Antwerp.

573
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:24,425
My cheeks are burning.

574
00:48:24,632 --> 00:48:28,221
How amusing!
I think I drank too much.

575
00:48:34,125 --> 00:48:38,350
I'll leave you now.
I'm not feeling very well.

576
00:48:38,588 --> 00:48:40,815
Then I'll be going.

577
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:46,415
Please.
Let's chat a bit more.

578
00:48:53,445 --> 00:48:56,500
Good night, my darling.

579
00:49:08,834 --> 00:49:10,561
I'm really worried.

580
00:49:10,766 --> 00:49:14,457
Geneviève is sad,
secretive, independent.

581
00:49:14,664 --> 00:49:18,787
And I admit I'm probably not
tactful or understanding enough.

582
00:49:18,994 --> 00:49:21,618
I'm always afraid of hurting her.

583
00:49:21,826 --> 00:49:24,654
I wouldn't want to sound ridiculous,

584
00:49:24,856 --> 00:49:29,013
and my feelings
could seem insincere,

585
00:49:29,521 --> 00:49:30,645
however...

586
00:49:31,019 --> 00:49:34,948
although I am taking this step,
I wouldn't want

587
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:37,047
to give the wrong impression.

588
00:49:37,249 --> 00:49:42,768
My only desire
is to bring happiness.

589
00:49:44,577 --> 00:49:47,269
Am I making myself clear?

590
00:49:47,474 --> 00:49:50,960
Actually, not really.

591
00:50:00,499 --> 00:50:02,963
Ever since dinner began,

592
00:50:03,164 --> 00:50:07,150
I've been trying to broach a subject
that preoccupies me,

593
00:50:07,361 --> 00:50:11,415
but my feelings are equaled
only by my shyness.

594
00:50:12,158 --> 00:50:15,417
I came to ask you
for Geneviève's hand.

595
00:50:16,322 --> 00:50:18,582
I'm very clumsy, I know.

596
00:50:18,786 --> 00:50:22,477
Not at all,
but this is so unexpected.

597
00:50:23,117 --> 00:50:26,343
Geneviève for me is still a child,

598
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:30,805
and your abrupt request
is somewhat unsettling.

599
00:50:31,877 --> 00:50:36,569
You see, I don't know
Geneviève's feelings for you.

600
00:50:37,641 --> 00:50:41,502
She's only spoken of you as a friend.

601
00:50:42,104 --> 00:50:47,294
I wouldn't want
to pressure her in any way.

602
00:50:48,466 --> 00:50:53,623
We know nothing about you.

603
00:50:57,094 --> 00:51:02,489
Long ago, I loved a woman.

604
00:51:04,022 --> 00:51:06,884
She didn't love me.

605
00:51:08,019 --> 00:51:10,246
Her name was Lola.

606
00:51:10,451 --> 00:51:12,972
It was long ago.

607
00:51:14,082 --> 00:51:18,375
<i>Disappointed, I tried to forget her.</i>

608
00:51:19,845 --> 00:51:22,967
<i>I left France.</i>

609
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:28,704
<i>I traveled to the ends of the earth.</i>

610
00:51:31,903 --> 00:51:35,389
<i>But I had no more taste for life.</i>

611
00:51:36,067 --> 00:51:39,293
<i>Then, by chance,</i>

612
00:51:39,831 --> 00:51:43,454
our paths crossed.

613
00:51:47,825 --> 00:51:51,256
As soon as I saw Geneviève,

614
00:51:51,823 --> 00:51:54,877
I knew she was the one
I'd been waiting for.

615
00:51:55,820 --> 00:52:02,373
Since I met her,
life has new meaning.

616
00:52:03,615 --> 00:52:07,101
She's always before my eyes.

617
00:52:07,745 --> 00:52:11,606
I live only for her.

618
00:52:11,809 --> 00:52:14,898
I think only of her.

619
00:52:15,106 --> 00:52:18,229
I had to

620
00:52:19,704 --> 00:52:23,565
speak to you frankly.

621
00:52:23,934 --> 00:52:27,023
Don't be offended.

622
00:52:27,865 --> 00:52:30,761
Of course, I wouldn't think

623
00:52:30,963 --> 00:52:34,653
of influencing Geneviève.

624
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:40,852
Geneviève is free.

625
00:52:52,514 --> 00:52:56,376
Tomorrow I go back
to Amsterdam for three months.

626
00:52:56,578 --> 00:53:02,007
When I return,
Geneviève can give me her answer.

627
00:53:02,541 --> 00:53:05,801
I don't know what to say.

628
00:53:06,272 --> 00:53:08,793
Don't say anything.

629
00:53:09,003 --> 00:53:13,160
Geneviève will decide for herself.

630
00:53:36,651 --> 00:53:37,616
You're not asleep?

631
00:53:37,817 --> 00:53:39,509
You can see that.

632
00:53:40,681 --> 00:53:44,167
Roland Cassard asked for your hand.

633
00:53:45,578 --> 00:53:48,167
I heard.

634
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:52,366
You didn't tell him I'm pregnant?

635
00:53:52,807 --> 00:53:56,293
I didn't dare.

636
00:54:40,007 --> 00:54:42,766
<i>I'm very proud of you.</i>

637
00:54:42,972 --> 00:54:46,834
<i>François is a pretty name</i>
<i>for a boy.</i>

638
00:54:47,036 --> 00:54:49,001
<i>Time passes slowly here.</i>

639
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:52,324
<i>Furloughs have been suspended,</i>

640
00:54:52,532 --> 00:54:55,553
<i>and I don't know</i>

641
00:54:56,130 --> 00:55:00,219
<i>if I'll be returning</i>
<i>to France very soon.</i>

642
00:55:00,526 --> 00:55:03,786
<i>My love,</i>
<i>I know you're waiting for me.</i>

643
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:11,811
<i>Last night, one of our patrols</i>
<i>fell into an ambush.</i>

644
00:55:12,152 --> 00:55:14,117
<i>Three soldiers were killed.</i>

645
00:55:14,317 --> 00:55:16,577
<i>All the same, I don't think</i>

646
00:55:16,782 --> 00:55:20,405
<i>that there's great danger here.</i>

647
00:55:21,512 --> 00:55:26,237
<i>But it is strange how sun and death</i>

648
00:55:26,775 --> 00:55:30,569
<i>travel together.</i>

649
00:55:35,669 --> 00:55:38,395
Geneviève, come to dinner, darling.

650
00:56:04,317 --> 00:56:06,543
<i>Dear Mr. Cassard,</i>

651
00:56:06,748 --> 00:56:10,234
<i>we greatly appreciated</i>
<i>your postcard,</i>

652
00:56:10,446 --> 00:56:13,171
<i>Mother and I.</i>

653
00:57:20,302 --> 00:57:22,766
I find these people ridiculous.

654
00:57:22,966 --> 00:57:24,897
I hate the carnival.

655
00:57:25,099 --> 00:57:27,586
Don't be bitter, darling.

656
00:57:29,395 --> 00:57:31,916
It's incredible how big you are!

657
00:57:32,393 --> 00:57:36,346
You're carrying in front.
It will be a boy, or twins.

658
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:39,052
No, everything is normal.

659
00:57:39,555 --> 00:57:41,417
I feel wonderful.

660
00:57:41,621 --> 00:57:44,744
You're like me.
I was delighted, never sick.

661
00:57:44,951 --> 00:57:48,177
The day before you were born,
I was up on a ladder,

662
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:51,176
changing the wallpaper in the shop.

663
00:57:53,513 --> 00:57:55,841
Has the postman come?

664
00:57:56,377 --> 00:57:59,034
There were only bills

665
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:02,198
and some advertising.

666
00:58:02,606 --> 00:58:05,537
Why? Are you still waiting?

667
00:58:10,567 --> 00:58:12,895
In his last letter, he wrote

668
00:58:13,099 --> 00:58:16,722
he was sad because
he wouldn't see me pregnant.

669
00:58:17,562 --> 00:58:19,958
And perhaps it's just as well.

670
00:58:20,161 --> 00:58:21,217
I look awful.

671
00:58:21,427 --> 00:58:22,687
A pregnant woman

672
00:58:22,892 --> 00:58:25,322
is always beautiful, my darling.

673
00:58:28,355 --> 00:58:29,944
That's true.

674
00:58:31,253 --> 00:58:32,650
Look at this.

675
00:58:33,219 --> 00:58:37,376
A vest. And I saw pretty rompers
at the department store.

676
00:58:38,016 --> 00:58:39,878
Admit that you're pleased.

677
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:43,306
I'd be more pleased
if that child had a father,

678
00:58:43,511 --> 00:58:45,703
and if you had a husband.

679
00:58:46,809 --> 00:58:49,103
Guy will return.

680
00:58:50,673 --> 00:58:53,263
Guy or someone else.

681
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:57,800
Absence is a funny thing.

682
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:03,852
It feels as if Guy left years ago.

683
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:06,654
I look at this picture,

684
00:59:06,862 --> 00:59:09,792
and I forget
what he really looks like.

685
00:59:09,994 --> 00:59:13,617
And when I think of him,
it's this picture that I see.

686
00:59:14,357 --> 00:59:18,310
It's all I have left of him.

687
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:30,801
Don't smoke. Be reasonable.

688
00:59:41,205 --> 00:59:42,568
What's that?

689
00:59:42,771 --> 00:59:44,667
A postcard from Hamburg.

690
00:59:44,869 --> 00:59:46,800
From Roland Cassard.

691
00:59:47,001 --> 00:59:47,762
For me?

692
00:59:47,968 --> 00:59:49,989
For us. You may read it.

693
00:59:50,832 --> 00:59:53,489
He says he'll be back soon.

694
00:59:54,196 --> 00:59:57,217
He asks if you've thought it over.

695
00:59:57,628 --> 01:00:00,614
It doesn't seem to me
there's any hurry.

696
01:00:01,092 --> 01:00:04,147
No, but you must think it over.

697
01:00:04,656 --> 01:00:07,142
I am thinking it over, Mother.

698
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:10,443
Here's a man, rich, refined,

699
01:00:10,652 --> 01:00:13,081
and enamored of you,
and I think...

700
01:00:14,949 --> 01:00:16,743
What are you doing?

701
01:00:17,247 --> 01:00:19,041
Aren't you feeling well?

702
01:00:19,246 --> 01:00:21,040
I'm all right, Mother.

703
01:00:21,245 --> 01:00:21,971
You're eating.

704
01:00:22,177 --> 01:00:24,698
I can't help it.
I'm always hungry.

705
01:00:25,641 --> 01:00:29,628
He's not a womanizer,
a smooth talker on the prowl,

706
01:00:29,972 --> 01:00:33,958
but a man who has lived
and suffered.

707
01:00:34,835 --> 01:00:38,287
I know, Mother,
but don't give me a sales talk.

708
01:00:38,666 --> 01:00:42,289
You praise him
like you praise your umbrellas.

709
01:00:42,796 --> 01:00:45,124
Because he'll protect you, Geneviève.

710
01:00:45,328 --> 01:00:46,123
Very funny.

711
01:00:46,327 --> 01:00:49,950
If you can't take a little humor,
you're lost!

712
01:00:51,823 --> 01:00:55,344
Guy might have been your ideal,

713
01:00:55,554 --> 01:00:57,882
but what future did he offer you?

714
01:00:59,052 --> 01:01:02,278
You know,
I too was once wooed

715
01:01:02,483 --> 01:01:05,413
by a young man
who was not your father.

716
01:01:05,614 --> 01:01:08,442
You'd have done better to marry him.

717
01:01:08,878 --> 01:01:10,571
You're right.

718
01:01:10,777 --> 01:01:13,832
But understand
that I want you to be happy

719
01:01:14,042 --> 01:01:17,665
and not ruin your life
the way I ruined mine.

720
01:01:17,872 --> 01:01:20,927
Don't worry about my life, Mother.

721
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:24,822
I have no intention whatsoever

722
01:01:25,067 --> 01:01:27,157
of ruining it.

723
01:01:29,564 --> 01:01:32,995
Do you think Cassard
will want to marry me

724
01:01:33,195 --> 01:01:35,819
when he sees I'm knocked up?

725
01:01:36,027 --> 01:01:37,423
Watch your language!

726
01:01:37,626 --> 01:01:39,215
Deformed! Bloated!

727
01:01:39,424 --> 01:01:42,819
Since neither you nor I
had the courage

728
01:01:43,022 --> 01:01:46,043
to confess the truth to him,

729
01:01:46,519 --> 01:01:49,677
now, at least, it will show!

730
01:01:54,348 --> 01:01:57,244
Do you believe
he'll take me like this?

731
01:01:57,445 --> 01:01:59,569
If he refuses me as I am,

732
01:01:59,777 --> 01:02:01,968
it means he doesn't have

733
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:04,197
deep feelings for me.

734
01:02:04,407 --> 01:02:07,700
But if, by some unlikely chance,
he accepts me,

735
01:02:07,905 --> 01:02:10,892
I'll have no reason to doubt him,

736
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:14,225
and I'd be a fool to reject him.

737
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:17,728
So, you see, I'm thinking it over.

738
01:02:17,931 --> 01:02:21,361
But all this is so difficult.

739
01:02:28,890 --> 01:02:33,842
Why is absence

740
01:02:34,087 --> 01:02:38,039
so heavy to bear?

741
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:43,180
Why is Guy

742
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:46,707
fading away from me?

743
01:02:49,310 --> 01:02:53,637
I would have died

744
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,932
for him.

745
01:02:57,737 --> 01:03:03,427
Why aren't I dead?

746
01:03:23,853 --> 01:03:24,749
Look.

747
01:03:24,985 --> 01:03:26,643
What is it?

748
01:03:26,851 --> 01:03:28,509
It's for you.

749
01:03:29,283 --> 01:03:31,746
Roland sent it for you.

750
01:03:32,214 --> 01:03:35,144
I can't accept it.

751
01:03:37,377 --> 01:03:39,568
Do as you like.

752
01:03:58,429 --> 01:04:02,119
We'll bring this child up together.

753
01:04:02,626 --> 01:04:05,647
He'll be our child.

754
01:04:06,257 --> 01:04:08,949
Please say yes,

755
01:04:09,754 --> 01:04:12,718
Geneviève.

756
01:04:14,085 --> 01:04:16,947
I don't want all this

757
01:04:18,149 --> 01:04:21,601
to upset you in the least.

758
01:04:22,646 --> 01:04:25,132
I love you,

759
01:04:25,777 --> 01:04:28,764
Geneviève.

760
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:41,423
She accepts,

761
01:04:41,633 --> 01:04:45,824
since her present condition

762
01:04:46,430 --> 01:04:47,917
doesn't frighten you.

763
01:04:48,129 --> 01:04:50,184
But don't rush her.

764
01:04:50,393 --> 01:04:52,584
She's so fragile

765
01:04:52,825 --> 01:04:54,914
that the slightest mistake

766
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:58,053
could compromise everything.

769
01:07:15,794 --> 01:07:18,519
Madeleine told me everything.

770
01:07:19,025 --> 01:07:21,013
Why didn't you say anything?

771
01:07:21,224 --> 01:07:22,813
I didn't want to.

772
01:07:23,023 --> 01:07:25,782
I thought you knew.

773
01:07:26,653 --> 01:07:28,811
Didn't you suspect anything?

774
01:07:29,018 --> 01:07:32,005
Of course. Over the last few months,

775
01:07:33,116 --> 01:07:35,875
her letters weren't the same.

776
01:07:36,546 --> 01:07:39,601
She didn't answer my questions.

777
01:07:40,577 --> 01:07:43,234
She wrote without conviction.

778
01:07:43,742 --> 01:07:47,432
But from there
to marrying another man!

779
01:07:48,271 --> 01:07:50,599
No, I thought she was mad at me,

780
01:07:50,703 --> 01:07:52,258
but I didn't know why.

781
01:07:52,369 --> 01:07:55,162
Then there was the hospital

782
01:07:55,899 --> 01:07:58,489
and my letters
that went unanswered.

783
01:08:02,528 --> 01:08:05,015
Here nothing has changed.

784
01:08:05,293 --> 01:08:06,815
I have.

785
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:09,681
I can let go

786
01:08:10,856 --> 01:08:12,411
now that you're here.

787
01:08:12,622 --> 01:08:17,176
I would have been so unhappy
not to see you again.

788
01:08:18,451 --> 01:08:20,416
Don't talk nonsense.

789
01:08:20,716 --> 01:08:23,703
Come on, make yourself useful,
my boy.

790
01:08:24,513 --> 01:08:27,341
Give me some herb tea.

791
01:08:28,711 --> 01:08:30,471
Everything's ready

792
01:08:30,842 --> 01:08:32,330
in the kitchen.

793
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:35,903
There's water in the kettle.

794
01:08:38,104 --> 01:08:40,330
Something wrong with your leg?

795
01:08:40,536 --> 01:08:43,193
You see, I limp a little.

796
01:08:47,431 --> 01:08:49,157
It's like having

797
01:08:49,363 --> 01:08:52,327
a barometer in my knee.

798
01:08:53,061 --> 01:08:54,889
Especially when it rains.

799
01:08:55,092 --> 01:08:58,523
It was in the hospital
that I suffered the most.

800
01:08:59,389 --> 01:09:01,819
But how did it happen?

801
01:09:02,387 --> 01:09:05,839
Returning one night from maneuvers.

802
01:09:06,085 --> 01:09:07,674
We were attacked.

803
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:11,212
Hand grenades.
It happened often.

804
01:09:14,979 --> 01:09:16,171
What about Madeleine?

805
01:09:16,377 --> 01:09:18,501
She's coming.

806
01:09:18,709 --> 01:09:21,696
She's been very good to me.

807
01:09:22,674 --> 01:09:25,502
Isn't she married yet?

808
01:09:26,571 --> 01:09:29,001
You know how well-behaved she is.

809
01:09:33,866 --> 01:09:35,297
Put it over there

810
01:09:35,498 --> 01:09:37,463
on the table.

811
01:09:41,794 --> 01:09:44,519
What will you do now?

812
01:09:46,324 --> 01:09:49,083
Work. Or maybe live

813
01:09:49,788 --> 01:09:51,412
off my pension.

814
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:56,072
Aubin promised to take you back.

815
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:58,539
You liked his gas station.

816
01:09:58,849 --> 01:10:02,574
Oh, his or someone else's.

817
01:10:02,879 --> 01:10:06,240
We'll see. I have time.
There's no hurry.

818
01:10:11,606 --> 01:10:14,570
The child she was expecting...

819
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:16,567
do you know anything about it?

820
01:10:16,836 --> 01:10:21,061
No. Geneviève left
just after the wedding.

821
01:10:22,332 --> 01:10:24,762
Mrs. Emery stayed

822
01:10:25,264 --> 01:10:28,160
in Cherbourg a month or two.

823
01:10:29,195 --> 01:10:32,249
Then she sold the shop.

824
01:10:33,791 --> 01:10:36,778
I think they're in Paris.

825
01:10:48,914 --> 01:10:51,777
You haven't changed.

826
01:10:52,246 --> 01:10:54,437
I'm happy

827
01:10:54,677 --> 01:10:58,538
that you've returned.

828
01:11:46,675 --> 01:11:48,038
Foucher!

829
01:11:50,605 --> 01:11:51,729
The boss wants you.

830
01:11:54,236 --> 01:11:55,202
Shit!

831
01:12:04,429 --> 01:12:06,893
Did you service this gentleman's car?

832
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:11,419
Complete checkup on the 26th,
right, sir?

833
01:12:13,223 --> 01:12:16,449
Two thrown rods this morning.
The engine is dead.

834
01:12:16,654 --> 01:12:18,585
A brand-new engine.
Not a drop of oil!

835
01:12:19,419 --> 01:12:22,712
I'm not blaming anyone,
but that's it. I'm real sorry.

836
01:12:22,983 --> 01:12:24,880
Did you check the oil gauge?

837
01:12:25,081 --> 01:12:25,944
Of course.

838
01:12:26,147 --> 01:12:27,737
You forgot to screw the cap on.

839
01:12:27,946 --> 01:12:29,206
I know my job.

840
01:12:29,446 --> 01:12:31,377
Don't talk to me like that!

841
01:12:31,577 --> 01:12:33,099
And apologize to the gentleman.

842
01:12:33,643 --> 01:12:35,664
I don't have to.
It wasn't my fault.

843
01:12:36,041 --> 01:12:37,938
You don't give a damn
about your work.

844
01:12:38,139 --> 01:12:42,069
Why don't you buy some new overalls?
And shave before you come to work!

845
01:12:42,403 --> 01:12:45,094
I've had enough.
I'll find another job.

846
01:12:48,732 --> 01:12:50,993
That stupid ass.
Since he got out of the army,

847
01:12:51,097 --> 01:12:53,358
he acts like a hoodlum.

848
01:12:57,759 --> 01:12:59,724
What's going on?

849
01:12:59,924 --> 01:13:01,184
I'm quitting.

850
01:13:02,123 --> 01:13:05,314
I had a fight with Aubin
and quit before he could fire me.

851
01:13:05,521 --> 01:13:06,543
What will you do?

852
01:13:06,753 --> 01:13:08,741
Live off my pension.

853
01:13:45,093 --> 01:13:46,887
A dry white wine.

854
01:13:55,186 --> 01:13:56,845
Another.

855
01:14:01,815 --> 01:14:03,371
Take it out of this.

856
01:14:04,947 --> 01:14:06,502
Don't you have anything smaller?

857
01:14:07,711 --> 01:14:10,971
You're all the same,
with your big bills.

858
01:14:11,376 --> 01:14:12,864
What of it, you bum?

859
01:14:13,074 --> 01:14:14,936
Just do your job and lay off!

860
01:14:16,805 --> 01:14:18,531
Just forget it.

861
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:54,135
What are you looking for?

862
01:14:54,347 --> 01:14:55,243
Nothing.

863
01:14:55,446 --> 01:14:57,172
Then move your ass.

864
01:14:57,610 --> 01:14:59,733
You're in the way.

865
01:15:36,484 --> 01:15:38,311
Cognac.

866
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:49,973
Want to dance?

867
01:15:52,773 --> 01:15:54,761
Leave me alone.

868
01:16:13,392 --> 01:16:15,550
Something wrong, baby?

869
01:16:20,787 --> 01:16:23,580
Come with me if you want.

870
01:16:25,284 --> 01:16:27,510
You're really

871
01:16:27,782 --> 01:16:30,338
a sweet girl.

872
01:16:34,411 --> 01:16:36,602
Evening, Madame Germaine.

873
01:16:39,275 --> 01:16:40,830
Evening, Jenny.

874
01:17:10,852 --> 01:17:13,544
You can call me Geneviève

875
01:17:13,751 --> 01:17:15,181
if you'd like.

876
01:17:20,346 --> 01:17:24,140
You're going to say
I remind you of someone.

877
01:17:27,674 --> 01:17:29,831
Good-bye, Jenny.

878
01:17:31,005 --> 01:17:33,401
Come again sometime.

879
01:17:52,324 --> 01:17:54,482
Sorry, Madeleine.

880
01:17:55,988 --> 01:17:58,112
I didn't have my key.

881
01:18:01,318 --> 01:18:03,146
What's the matter?

882
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:06,007
Elise died

883
01:18:06,315 --> 01:18:08,303
last night.

884
01:18:35,395 --> 01:18:40,324
I can't stay any longer

885
01:18:41,224 --> 01:18:43,814
in this apartment.

886
01:18:44,055 --> 01:18:45,952
I'm too unhappy.

887
01:18:46,287 --> 01:18:49,615
I want to leave soon.

888
01:18:49,851 --> 01:18:52,475
But where will you go?

889
01:18:52,683 --> 01:18:54,409
I don't know.

890
01:18:54,614 --> 01:18:57,170
You have no family.

891
01:18:57,380 --> 01:19:00,810
Don't you want to stay here?

892
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:02,405
What would I do?

893
01:19:02,609 --> 01:19:04,267
You'd help me.

894
01:19:04,475 --> 01:19:07,905
I'll be lonely.

895
01:19:09,471 --> 01:19:12,492
You don't need anyone.

896
01:19:13,202 --> 01:19:16,496
I need you, Madeleine.

897
01:19:18,498 --> 01:19:21,428
Why don't you just say
you don't like

898
01:19:21,630 --> 01:19:23,821
being alone?

899
01:19:26,126 --> 01:19:30,113
I don't see
what I could do for you.

900
01:19:30,524 --> 01:19:34,317
I have no influence over you.

901
01:19:35,987 --> 01:19:38,746
That's not true.

902
01:19:43,515 --> 01:19:47,036
I don't like what you've become.

903
01:19:48,445 --> 01:19:51,432
You hang about
with nothing to do.

904
01:19:51,642 --> 01:19:54,800
You're sad and bitter.

905
01:19:55,306 --> 01:19:58,270
You've changed a lot.

906
01:19:58,471 --> 01:20:02,026
It's not my fault.
Since I came back,

907
01:20:02,235 --> 01:20:05,461
things don't make sense anymore.

908
01:20:05,733 --> 01:20:09,026
I don't think I can help you.

909
01:20:09,897 --> 01:20:12,883
You're too far away.

910
01:20:13,094 --> 01:20:17,353
What if I asked you to try

911
01:20:17,558 --> 01:20:19,419
despite everything?

912
01:20:19,623 --> 01:20:23,848
I wouldn't hesitate to stay.

913
01:20:24,919 --> 01:20:27,781
I'm asking you.

914
01:20:28,118 --> 01:20:31,741
Then I'll try.

915
01:21:19,582 --> 01:21:21,808
I'm a bit late.

916
01:21:22,713 --> 01:21:25,506
The lawyer took forever,

917
01:21:25,711 --> 01:21:28,334
and I stopped by the garage.

918
01:21:29,176 --> 01:21:32,140
Now everything is settled.

919
01:21:32,540 --> 01:21:34,528
Poor Elise.

920
01:21:35,005 --> 01:21:37,833
Nothing will be left of her.

921
01:21:38,036 --> 01:21:41,023
On the contrary.

922
01:21:41,667 --> 01:21:44,392
She'll be part of everything we do.

923
01:21:48,163 --> 01:21:49,321
Are you happy?

924
01:21:49,529 --> 01:21:51,153
Very.

925
01:21:51,493 --> 01:21:54,219
And it's all thanks to you.

926
01:21:55,024 --> 01:21:57,488
Madeleine, you know it's true.

927
01:22:01,254 --> 01:22:04,309
And you? Are you happy?

928
01:22:05,384 --> 01:22:08,439
I'm not unhappy.

929
01:22:10,714 --> 01:22:12,372
I wanted to tell you...

930
01:22:12,579 --> 01:22:15,804
That is, I've been thinking
that if you wanted

931
01:22:16,010 --> 01:22:18,304
to share my life...

932
01:22:18,841 --> 01:22:22,793
if I weren't
too much of a burden...

933
01:22:23,805 --> 01:22:24,792
and that...

934
01:22:25,004 --> 01:22:25,969
Are you crying?

935
01:22:26,203 --> 01:22:27,929
No.

936
01:22:30,466 --> 01:22:32,624
Did I say something wrong?

937
01:22:33,365 --> 01:22:34,954
Not at all...

938
01:22:35,164 --> 01:22:38,286
but it makes me so happy,

939
01:22:38,827 --> 01:22:41,291
and at the same time,
it scares me.

940
01:22:41,493 --> 01:22:43,514
You're scared of me?

941
01:22:43,724 --> 01:22:46,245
No... a little... well...

942
01:22:46,489 --> 01:22:48,579
you understand...

943
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:53,741
Have you given up
thinking about Geneviève?

944
01:22:54,384 --> 01:22:57,405
Are you sure you really love me?

945
01:22:57,615 --> 01:23:00,579
I'm not scared, but I wonder

946
01:23:00,779 --> 01:23:04,470
if you're not acting
out of despair.

947
01:23:05,377 --> 01:23:07,238
You're quite wrong.

948
01:23:07,941 --> 01:23:10,996
I don't want to think
about Geneviève anymore.

949
01:23:11,339 --> 01:23:14,326
I assure you,
I've forgotten everything.

950
01:23:14,670 --> 01:23:17,997
I want to be happy with you.

951
01:23:18,468 --> 01:23:21,125
Madeleine, don't cry.

952
01:23:21,665 --> 01:23:24,391
I don't have much ambition...

953
01:23:24,763 --> 01:23:28,624
but if I could
make this dream come true:

954
01:23:29,926 --> 01:23:34,288
To be happy with a woman...

955
01:23:34,589 --> 01:23:39,280
in a life we've chosen

956
01:23:40,019 --> 01:23:42,813
together...

957
01:24:03,503 --> 01:24:05,263
I'm done.

958
01:24:06,501 --> 01:24:07,795
It's very beautiful.

959
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,431
You think so?

960
01:24:16,594 --> 01:24:18,683
Your hands are cold.

961
01:24:22,957 --> 01:24:25,421
I'm going out now.

962
01:24:26,454 --> 01:24:28,214
If you want.

963
01:24:29,385 --> 01:24:33,280
Our son would like to see
the toys in the store windows.

964
01:24:33,482 --> 01:24:36,412
He's been talking about it all week.

965
01:24:37,247 --> 01:24:41,006
I'll take him for a look
before dinner.

966
01:24:42,476 --> 01:24:43,498
Stop that, will you?

967
01:24:43,876 --> 01:24:47,033
François, you'll make us deaf!

968
01:24:50,204 --> 01:24:54,031
I got you a lovely
Christmas present.

969
01:24:54,235 --> 01:24:55,495
What is it?

970
01:24:55,701 --> 01:24:58,688
It's a surprise. You'll see.

971
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:07,518
Bundle up.

972
01:25:08,525 --> 01:25:10,921
I love you, Guy.

973
01:25:18,219 --> 01:25:20,739
François,
come and put your coat on.

974
01:25:27,912 --> 01:25:31,501
Say hello to Santa Claus for me.

975
01:26:03,021 --> 01:26:05,485
Françoise, stop that.

976
01:26:08,251 --> 01:26:10,875
The horn isn't a toy.

977
01:26:27,005 --> 01:26:28,992
It's cold.

978
01:26:29,237 --> 01:26:31,793
Come into the office.

979
01:26:58,549 --> 01:27:01,672
It's warmer here.

980
01:27:11,141 --> 01:27:15,298
This is my first time
back in Cherbourg

981
01:27:15,938 --> 01:27:18,731
since I got married.

982
01:27:20,302 --> 01:27:23,130
I went to pick up my daughter

983
01:27:23,333 --> 01:27:26,421
at my mother-in-law's in Anjou.

984
01:27:31,494 --> 01:27:33,720
On the way back to Paris,

985
01:27:34,125 --> 01:27:36,919
I decided to make a detour.

986
01:27:38,256 --> 01:27:41,084
I never thought I'd run into you.

987
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:45,148
It's pure chance.

988
01:27:47,117 --> 01:27:49,546
Does madame want me to fill it up?

989
01:27:49,748 --> 01:27:51,372
Geneviève...

990
01:27:51,979 --> 01:27:53,239
Yes, fill it up.

991
01:27:53,445 --> 01:27:55,205
Super or regular?

992
01:27:55,411 --> 01:27:57,307
It doesn't matter.

993
01:27:58,242 --> 01:28:01,138
Which do you want?
Super?

994
01:28:08,068 --> 01:28:09,794
This is a pretty tree.

995
01:28:10,001 --> 01:28:12,363
Did you decorate it?

996
01:28:12,566 --> 01:28:16,518
No, my wife did.
It's mostly for the kid.

997
01:28:20,294 --> 01:28:21,952
Of course.

998
01:28:24,158 --> 01:28:25,623
Are you in mourning?

999
01:28:25,823 --> 01:28:29,049
Mother died last autumn.

1000
01:28:37,215 --> 01:28:39,873
What did you name her?

1001
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:42,045
Françoise.

1002
01:28:42,445 --> 01:28:45,432
She's a lot like you.

1003
01:28:46,376 --> 01:28:48,862
Do you want to see her?

1004
01:28:54,270 --> 01:28:57,030
I think you're all set.

1005
01:29:06,095 --> 01:29:08,423
