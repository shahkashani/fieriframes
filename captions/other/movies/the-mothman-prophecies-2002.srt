1
00:01:36,504 --> 00:01:37,881
Jesus!

2
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,969
Are you still there?

3
00:01:43,052 --> 00:01:44,429
No, I'm back.

4
00:01:44,512 --> 00:01:47,390
I'm not sure I got the spelling.

5
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:51,352
It is a "Y" Okay, great.
Yes, thank you. Bye.

6
00:02:01,738 --> 00:02:04,824
Honey, you there?
Pick up, pick up.

7
00:02:04,908 --> 00:02:08,953
You're not there. Okay.
Look, it's a little after 6:00.

8
00:02:09,078 --> 00:02:11,789
I'll catch a ride
and see you out there. Bye.

9
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:18,087
- Jack.
- Yeah?

10
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:22,550
The Balkans peace council is "comprised"
or "composed" of ten members?

11
00:02:22,634 --> 00:02:24,093
Twelve members.

12
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,095
Oh, right. Thanks.

13
00:02:27,555 --> 00:02:29,015
Composed.

14
00:02:30,225 --> 00:02:31,518
What?

15
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:37,190
A three-block area
has been evacuated.

16
00:02:37,232 --> 00:02:40,235
You might wanna avoid that route
coming home from work.

17
00:03:17,105 --> 00:03:20,817
- What do you think, Cy?
- This'll make them sweat. It's good.

18
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,528
- I'll lead with it.
- Great. I'll see you Monday.

19
00:03:23,611 --> 00:03:25,405
What?

20
00:03:25,488 --> 00:03:27,740
- I gotta go.
- Come on, John.

21
00:03:27,824 --> 00:03:32,745
It'll look bad, my star reporter
not showing up at the Christmas party.

22
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:37,709
I can't.

23
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:39,711
Mary's waiting for me.

24
00:04:34,015 --> 00:04:37,811
It's a big house, isn't it?
It's a steal at this price.

25
00:04:38,436 --> 00:04:40,271
That's if you want it.

26
00:04:40,355 --> 00:04:42,774
But we're gonna have to
make an offer today.

27
00:04:42,857 --> 00:04:45,735
The owner's highly motivated.

28
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,363
Think it over.
I'll make some calls.

29
00:04:49,197 --> 00:04:50,657
Take a look around.

30
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,659
Okay.
Thank you, Brian.

31
00:04:52,742 --> 00:04:54,202
Thank you very much.

32
00:04:59,082 --> 00:05:01,459
It's okay.
We're just gonna look.

33
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,133
My God.

34
00:05:54,179 --> 00:05:55,847
Here you are.

35
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:59,350
We were just making sure
there was adequate closet space.

36
00:05:59,434 --> 00:06:01,019
Good. Good.

37
00:06:01,144 --> 00:06:03,646
Well, this house is yours
if you want it...

38
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,232
but you have to decide right now.

39
00:06:06,357 --> 00:06:07,817
We'll take it.

40
00:06:07,942 --> 00:06:10,361
Really? Oh, my God!

41
00:06:47,065 --> 00:06:49,984
You know what I kept thinking
when we were looking at that house?

42
00:06:50,068 --> 00:06:52,987
That we should get
a mattress for that closet.

43
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:02,288
I kept thinking that
it felt like a dream come true.

44
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:11,548
Come here.

45
00:07:17,887 --> 00:07:20,890
- How fast can you drive this thing?
- Really fast.

46
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,058
Let's see.

47
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,227
Okay.

48
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:36,573
- We bought a really, really...
- Excuse me. We bought a house.

49
00:07:36,614 --> 00:07:38,700
We bought a big house.

50
00:08:08,897 --> 00:08:10,356
Mary.

51
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:19,282
Mary, are you all right?
Mary, talk to me.

52
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:20,742
Are you okay?

53
00:08:23,995 --> 00:08:26,581
Can you hear me?
Jesus Christ!

54
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,044
Hold on, darling.

55
00:08:31,961 --> 00:08:34,964
911, there's been an accident.

56
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:36,466
Yes.

57
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,033
Nothing.

58
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:09,457
You okay?

59
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,710
Yeah.

60
00:09:14,712 --> 00:09:16,798
All right.
It's all right.

61
00:09:21,678 --> 00:09:23,930
It's all right.
It's just me.

62
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,980
You didn't see it, did you?

63
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,859
See what?

64
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,573
What did you see?

65
00:09:45,994 --> 00:09:47,954
I didn't see anything.

66
00:09:56,212 --> 00:09:58,131
There's something wrong with me.

67
00:10:49,057 --> 00:10:51,518
It's called a glioblastoma.

68
00:10:52,644 --> 00:10:55,063
It's a temporal lobe tumor.

69
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:58,608
According to the doctor,
it's extremely rare.

70
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:00,735
One in...

71
00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:02,821
600,000 gets this thing.

72
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,782
Did they say it was
a result of the accident?

73
00:11:07,283 --> 00:11:09,410
No, it turns out...

74
00:11:09,494 --> 00:11:11,412
that it's been there a while.

75
00:11:13,498 --> 00:11:15,917
There's nothing else they can do?

76
00:11:17,418 --> 00:11:20,713
They did the surgery, and they
couldn't get it all out, so they'll...

77
00:11:22,132 --> 00:11:24,134
keep her on the chemo...

78
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:26,678
as long as her strength holds out.

79
00:11:28,638 --> 00:11:31,850
That's working.
I think she's looking better now.

80
00:11:33,351 --> 00:11:34,811
Good.

81
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,229
That's good.

82
00:11:38,857 --> 00:11:40,733
Two weeks ago...

83
00:11:40,817 --> 00:11:42,735
we were house hunting.

84
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,703
One day you're just
driving along in your car...

85
00:11:51,786 --> 00:11:54,080
and the universe...

86
00:11:54,122 --> 00:11:56,249
just points at you and says...

87
00:11:56,332 --> 00:12:00,378
"Ah, there you are, a happy couple.

88
00:12:00,461 --> 00:12:02,881
I've been looking for you.

89
00:12:04,215 --> 00:12:06,134
I've been looking for you".

90
00:12:09,888 --> 00:12:11,389
I'm sorry.

91
00:12:12,682 --> 00:12:14,142
For what?

92
00:12:18,229 --> 00:12:20,148
For all of this.

93
00:12:23,735 --> 00:12:26,696
I feel like I ruined everything.

94
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:39,834
You didn't ruin anything.

95
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,837
Not a damn thing.

96
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:48,009
I want you to be happy.

97
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,750
You didn't see it, did you?

98
00:14:56,387 --> 00:14:57,806
Yes.

99
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:26,102
Yeah?

100
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:27,395
She knew.

101
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:31,900
What?

102
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:35,653
She was drawing angels.

103
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:47,183
It was the meanness
of the campaigns...

104
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:51,020
the almost complete lack
of candor and honesty...

105
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:53,022
that turned the voters off..

106
00:17:55,984 --> 00:17:58,695
I think that these parties
are demonizing each other.

107
00:17:59,863 --> 00:18:03,449
They're projecting our own
personal fears and anxieties...

108
00:18:03,533 --> 00:18:05,451
onto the national stage.

109
00:18:05,535 --> 00:18:10,165
People don't like it. People are
very, very unsatisfied at the moment.

110
00:18:10,248 --> 00:18:14,210
It makes them complacent because they
don't see any possibility of change.

111
00:18:14,335 --> 00:18:18,465
2004... Is there a dark horse candidate
out there for the Democrats?

112
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,884
Well, I'm hearing a lot
about Russ McCallum.

113
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:23,386
- Governor of Virginia.
- Yeah, he might do what Carter...

114
00:18:27,557 --> 00:18:30,143
Hey, I told her to watch.

115
00:18:30,226 --> 00:18:31,519
Who?

116
00:18:31,603 --> 00:18:33,062
Peter's friend Gwen.

117
00:18:34,022 --> 00:18:35,940
She'll be there tonight.

118
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:40,278
Oh, God. Look, I don't think I'm gonna
be able to make that one tonight.

119
00:18:40,361 --> 00:18:42,864
Come on, you can't keep
blowing this thing off.

120
00:18:42,947 --> 00:18:45,241
I'm not. I've got an interview
with the governor.

121
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:47,911
I gotta be in Richmond
at 8:00 in the morning.

122
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:53,833
I almost forgot.
McCallum's office called.

123
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:56,377
They bumped the meeting
till tomorrow night.

124
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:03,718
Eddie, look, I...

125
00:19:03,802 --> 00:19:04,719
Look...

126
00:19:06,554 --> 00:19:08,640
she's not Mary.

127
00:19:08,723 --> 00:19:10,350
Not by a mile.

128
00:19:11,434 --> 00:19:13,019
But you know what?

129
00:19:14,479 --> 00:19:16,397
No one ever will be.

130
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:59,357
Hey, Ed.
I'm sorry about today.

131
00:20:01,442 --> 00:20:04,028
I'm sure Gwen is very nice.

132
00:20:04,112 --> 00:20:06,489
Maybe some other time.

133
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:08,616
It's about 1:00 in the morning.

134
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,536
I'm a little wired,
so I'm driving down to Richmond tonight.

135
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:13,371
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Bye.

136
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:08,384
Al I right, come on.

137
00:22:31,885 --> 00:22:35,889
Hi. I'm sorry. I know it's really late,
but my car broke down just up the road.

138
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:38,516
I wondered if I could use the phone.

139
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,018
Hello.

140
00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:43,146
It's him.

141
00:22:46,649 --> 00:22:48,610
I been waitin' for you.

142
00:22:49,611 --> 00:22:52,280
You son of a bitch.
What are you doin'?

143
00:22:52,363 --> 00:22:54,449
Get the door! Get the door!

144
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:57,911
Just stay right there.

145
00:23:00,371 --> 00:23:02,123
Mister, I don't know who you...

146
00:23:02,207 --> 00:23:03,124
Shut up!

147
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:06,169
Shut up.

148
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:11,090
Honey, Connie's here.

149
00:23:12,383 --> 00:23:14,928
Well, hey, Gordon.
How you doin'?

150
00:23:16,888 --> 00:23:19,349
Okay, why don't you just...

151
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:22,769
put down the gun and tell me
what's going on here.

152
00:23:23,686 --> 00:23:24,854
Yeah.

153
00:23:30,902 --> 00:23:34,864
He's come around three nights in a row.
This son of a bitch is stalking us.

154
00:23:34,906 --> 00:23:39,536
- I'm John Klein. My car broke down...
- Let's let Gordon finish, Mr. Klein.

155
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:42,247
Two nights ago...

156
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:46,292
at 2:30 in the a.m.,
there's a bang on the door.

157
00:23:47,168 --> 00:23:49,629
I open it up, and here's this guy.

158
00:23:49,754 --> 00:23:51,923
He says he wants to use the phone.

159
00:23:52,006 --> 00:23:54,717
But there's something
creepy about him...

160
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:56,886
so I tell him to get lost.

161
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:59,681
Last night at 2:30 on the dot,
guess who's back.

162
00:23:59,764 --> 00:24:01,683
You're sure it was Mr. Klein here?

163
00:24:01,766 --> 00:24:04,310
I am absolutely positive
it's Mr. Klein.

164
00:24:04,978 --> 00:24:07,897
- Crazy. This is...
- I am not crazy.

165
00:24:07,939 --> 00:24:11,151
- I didn't say that you...
- So then what happened?

166
00:24:11,234 --> 00:24:13,903
I warned him off my property.

167
00:24:13,945 --> 00:24:15,905
I used the word "trespass",
and he still came back.

168
00:24:15,947 --> 00:24:20,034
You're lucky I'm a Christian, because I
had the right to shoot you on my porch.

169
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,162
He'd have to been
inside the house, Gordon.

170
00:24:22,245 --> 00:24:23,705
What?

171
00:24:23,788 --> 00:24:25,206
Fine.

172
00:24:25,248 --> 00:24:29,210
So tonight I figured the dumb fuck might
come back, and sure enough, there he is.

173
00:24:31,254 --> 00:24:32,797
It wasn't me.

174
00:24:32,881 --> 00:24:35,884
I don't know what's happening here.

175
00:24:35,925 --> 00:24:37,802
Something's very wrong here.

176
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:42,307
I don't know these people.
I have never been here before.

177
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:44,601
I'm from DC. Look.

178
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,187
It's a wallet, okay? Wallet?

179
00:24:48,563 --> 00:24:49,939
I'm from DC.

180
00:24:50,023 --> 00:24:51,983
My name is John Klein.

181
00:24:59,616 --> 00:25:00,909
Washington Post.

182
00:25:00,992 --> 00:25:02,410
Yes.

183
00:25:06,998 --> 00:25:09,083
Can I get out of this shower now?

184
00:25:15,548 --> 00:25:18,051
You can wait for me outside,
Mr. Klein.

185
00:25:21,513 --> 00:25:26,059
We'll run a check on him.
Anyone else comes by, forget the gun.

186
00:25:26,184 --> 00:25:28,102
Just call me.

187
00:25:28,186 --> 00:25:30,563
Just find out what he wants.

188
00:25:44,494 --> 00:25:47,455
So, you didn't actually see the guy
before tonight?

189
00:25:47,497 --> 00:25:48,957
No.

190
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:51,960
But I heard the knocking.

191
00:25:52,001 --> 00:25:54,087
Three nights in a row.

192
00:25:57,507 --> 00:25:59,425
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

193
00:26:04,639 --> 00:26:08,017
I'm gonna give you a ride into town,
unless you wanna sleep in your car.

194
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:10,520
I can call for a tow in the morning.

195
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:18,486
You're a long way from DC.

196
00:26:19,487 --> 00:26:21,447
What are you doing here?

197
00:26:22,574 --> 00:26:24,033
Driving through.

198
00:26:25,618 --> 00:26:28,538
We're not on the way
to anyplace, Mr. Klein.

199
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:41,176
I recognize you.

200
00:26:43,887 --> 00:26:45,221
DC Review.

201
00:26:47,056 --> 00:26:50,435
- You watch that?
- We're not all bumpkins.

202
00:26:51,978 --> 00:26:53,897
So I'm not under arrest?

203
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,566
You didn't steal anything.
You didn't hurt anybody.

204
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:58,985
No breaking and entering.

205
00:26:59,068 --> 00:27:00,945
You've had trouble with him before?

206
00:27:00,987 --> 00:27:04,032
Gordy and Denise? No.

207
00:27:04,115 --> 00:27:05,533
They're good people.

208
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:09,579
Things have just been
a little strange around here lately.

209
00:27:23,134 --> 00:27:26,596
You still haven't told me what you're
doing here in the middle of the night.

210
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,224
I don't know.

211
00:27:35,647 --> 00:27:37,023
Where am I?

212
00:27:58,628 --> 00:28:01,005
Think you could show me
where we are on the map here?

213
00:28:01,089 --> 00:28:03,591
We're right on the state line.

214
00:28:10,306 --> 00:28:11,766
With Ohio.

215
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:39,627
- What time did you leave DC?
- 1:00 in the morning.

216
00:28:39,711 --> 00:28:43,214
If I was doing 80 the whole way, it
would've taken me six hours to get here.

217
00:28:43,298 --> 00:28:46,676
- There's gotta be a logical explanation.
- I don't know.

218
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:51,264
By the way, don't worry about your pal
the governor. I'll take care of it.

219
00:28:51,389 --> 00:28:52,891
Yeah. Okay.

220
00:28:53,016 --> 00:28:54,392
Thanks, Eddie.

221
00:28:54,476 --> 00:28:57,145
- So?
- It's running fine, Mr. Klein.

222
00:28:57,228 --> 00:28:59,772
- Can't find a thing wrong with her.
- Really?

223
00:29:01,107 --> 00:29:02,525
Strange.

224
00:29:04,068 --> 00:29:07,030
- All right, what do I owe you?
- Nothin'.

225
00:29:08,072 --> 00:29:10,992
I said I can't find
anything wrong with her.

226
00:29:48,905 --> 00:29:49,989
Mr. Smallwood.

227
00:29:53,952 --> 00:29:55,537
Mr. Smallwood...

228
00:29:58,998 --> 00:30:03,419
I just wanted to apologize for that
misunderstanding we had last night.

229
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:09,217
Are you sure it was me that came by
the last couple of nights?

230
00:30:10,301 --> 00:30:12,011
Listen, mister.

231
00:30:12,095 --> 00:30:13,972
Connie called me.

232
00:30:14,055 --> 00:30:17,934
She told me that you check out,
and that's good enough for me.

233
00:30:18,017 --> 00:30:22,188
I'm perfectly willing to let it go.

234
00:30:22,939 --> 00:30:25,900
But I don't drink anymore...

235
00:30:25,984 --> 00:30:27,986
and I don't lie.

236
00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:30,905
And as far as I know, I'm not crazy.

237
00:30:30,989 --> 00:30:33,741
So if you're accusing me...

238
00:30:39,747 --> 00:30:41,708
Look, here's the thing.

239
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,421
I don't know how
I ended up here last night.

240
00:30:48,631 --> 00:30:51,468
I didn't even know
I was in West Virginia.

241
00:30:52,427 --> 00:30:54,721
Some how, between 1:00 and 2:30...

242
00:30:54,804 --> 00:30:59,350
I traveled 400 miles and ended up
on that road by your house...

243
00:31:01,644 --> 00:31:04,731
and I've got no memory of it.

244
00:31:07,358 --> 00:31:09,569
And you call me crazy?

245
00:32:01,621 --> 00:32:04,541
I was afraid I'd see you here.

246
00:32:15,802 --> 00:32:16,719
Okay.

247
00:32:19,264 --> 00:32:21,891
You didn't show up.

248
00:32:21,975 --> 00:32:24,477
Too bad. I really wanted
to know what I look like.

249
00:32:26,896 --> 00:32:29,315
Sergeant, I'm curious.

250
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:31,401
Last night you said...

251
00:32:31,484 --> 00:32:34,362
things had been strange...

252
00:32:34,445 --> 00:32:35,864
around here lately.

253
00:32:35,905 --> 00:32:39,200
- What kind of things?
- You really don't want to know.

254
00:32:40,368 --> 00:32:42,328
Now I really need to know.

255
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,998
Just your odd reports.

256
00:32:45,123 --> 00:32:49,419
People seeing things they can't explain,
so they all come to me.

257
00:32:49,502 --> 00:32:51,087
'Cause you're the cop.

258
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,341
Because they know me.

259
00:33:01,097 --> 00:33:04,642
You know, if there are
other people in this town...

260
00:33:04,726 --> 00:33:06,686
who are feeling as...

261
00:33:07,854 --> 00:33:09,772
confused as I am right now...

262
00:33:09,856 --> 00:33:11,441
I'd sure like to hear it.

263
00:33:19,908 --> 00:33:23,328
The past few months,
people have been coming up to me...

264
00:33:23,411 --> 00:33:26,164
and reporting that they've
been seeing strange things.

265
00:33:26,247 --> 00:33:30,794
I don't mean the town speed freak.
I mean good, honest, church going people.

266
00:33:32,295 --> 00:33:34,214
I've known these folks
my entire life...

267
00:33:34,297 --> 00:33:36,591
and they seem down right embarrassed
to be bringing it up.

268
00:33:36,674 --> 00:33:38,426
Bringing what up?

269
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,595
It's hard to explain.

270
00:34:17,132 --> 00:34:19,634
Weird lights,
strange phone calls, you.

271
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:23,221
Seeing a UFO is one thing.

272
00:34:23,346 --> 00:34:27,225
What do you do when someone tells you
they saw this in their backyard?

273
00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:36,067
What is it?

274
00:34:39,863 --> 00:34:41,447
My wife died two years ago.

275
00:34:48,663 --> 00:34:50,874
She saw something.

276
00:34:50,957 --> 00:34:52,500
Drew pictures.

277
00:34:54,627 --> 00:34:56,087
Who showed you this?

278
00:35:08,266 --> 00:35:09,934
It was right here.

279
00:35:11,144 --> 00:35:14,981
There was only a foot or so
between its head and that branch.

280
00:35:15,064 --> 00:35:17,400
That makes it about...

281
00:35:17,484 --> 00:35:19,652
eight feet tall.

282
00:35:19,694 --> 00:35:21,571
Yeah.

283
00:35:21,654 --> 00:35:25,992
I was getting ready for bed and just
happened to glance out the window.

284
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,828
At first all I could see...

285
00:35:28,912 --> 00:35:32,332
were these two red eyes.

286
00:35:32,373 --> 00:35:34,334
I kept looking at it.

287
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,378
I couldn't stop.

288
00:35:38,963 --> 00:35:42,383
I've never had that feeling before,
like I couldn't move.

289
00:35:44,052 --> 00:35:46,262
And then I guess it just...

290
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:48,681
took off..

291
00:35:55,146 --> 00:35:57,899
That may not make much sense,
but it's...

292
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:01,361
the only way I can put it into words.

293
00:36:19,379 --> 00:36:21,631
You didn't see it, did you?

294
00:36:32,934 --> 00:36:35,061
It started about two months ago.

295
00:36:36,729 --> 00:36:40,024
Every time I answered the phone
I'd hear it.

296
00:36:40,108 --> 00:36:43,862
The first one was just
a loud beeping noise.

297
00:36:43,945 --> 00:36:48,158
Now they're mostly
these creaking, howling sounds.

298
00:36:49,909 --> 00:36:51,411
They all like this?

299
00:36:51,453 --> 00:36:55,331
Well, once it was a man
talking really fast.

300
00:36:55,415 --> 00:36:58,084
- What'd he say?
- I couldn't make it out.

301
00:36:58,168 --> 00:37:01,921
- Some foreign language.
- Have you had the line checked?

302
00:37:02,005 --> 00:37:04,674
I even had our number changed.

303
00:37:04,757 --> 00:37:08,178
But before I got a chance
to give it out to anyone...

304
00:37:09,762 --> 00:37:11,306
the calls started again.

305
00:37:16,311 --> 00:37:19,981
It's not a question of believing them.
Like I said, they're honest people.

306
00:37:20,064 --> 00:37:22,567
- How long you lived here?
- My whole life.

307
00:37:22,609 --> 00:37:25,445
- I grew up right over that hill.
- On a farm?

308
00:37:25,528 --> 00:37:27,071
Shucks, no.
A real live house.

309
00:37:27,947 --> 00:37:30,325
Indoor plumbing and everything.

310
00:37:30,408 --> 00:37:31,743
Sorry.

311
00:37:31,826 --> 00:37:34,329
We even had shoes for church
and schoolin' and stuff.

312
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,663
All right, all right.

313
00:37:41,044 --> 00:37:42,962
Where the hell are you?

314
00:37:43,046 --> 00:37:44,506
I'm still here.

315
00:37:44,589 --> 00:37:46,633
- West Virginia?
- Yeah.

316
00:37:48,301 --> 00:37:49,552
Something's come up.

317
00:37:49,636 --> 00:37:52,514
You're kidding. Something of
national interest in West Virginia?

318
00:37:52,597 --> 00:37:55,558
No, scientific.
I'll tell you about it later.

319
00:37:57,769 --> 00:38:00,188
Cy's beginning to look rabid.

320
00:38:00,271 --> 00:38:01,815
Keep him at bay, okay?

321
00:38:01,898 --> 00:38:04,484
Are you okay?
You sound a little stressed.

322
00:38:04,567 --> 00:38:06,986
No, I'm fine.
I'll talk to you later.

323
00:38:24,629 --> 00:38:26,756
We were parked up here...

324
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,008
and sort a making out
in the back seat.

325
00:38:43,314 --> 00:38:45,692
And what happened next...

326
00:38:45,775 --> 00:38:48,236
is sort of hard to explain.

327
00:39:16,514 --> 00:39:17,599
Next day...

328
00:39:18,933 --> 00:39:21,478
I woke up and...

329
00:39:21,561 --> 00:39:23,438
both my...

330
00:39:23,521 --> 00:39:25,440
my eyes were swelled up.

331
00:39:28,401 --> 00:39:30,195
What did the doctors say?

332
00:39:30,904 --> 00:39:32,822
He couldn't explain it.

333
00:39:35,533 --> 00:39:37,452
See this one here?

334
00:39:39,454 --> 00:39:41,581
It ain't never healed.

335
00:39:47,253 --> 00:39:49,172
We're getting engaged.

336
00:39:51,966 --> 00:39:53,426
That's good.

337
00:41:25,518 --> 00:41:28,646
- I gotta talk to you.
- Okay.

338
00:41:32,025 --> 00:41:34,694
Last night I woke up...

339
00:41:35,945 --> 00:41:38,865
with the worst headache
I've ever had in my life.

340
00:41:39,574 --> 00:41:43,661
I went into the bathroom
to get some aspirin...

341
00:41:43,745 --> 00:41:46,372
and I happened
to look in the mirror...

342
00:41:47,457 --> 00:41:49,459
and...

343
00:41:49,542 --> 00:41:51,669
I swear to God...

344
00:41:51,753 --> 00:41:53,671
I see something...

345
00:41:53,755 --> 00:41:55,340
I can't describe.

346
00:41:56,508 --> 00:41:58,259
But it sure as hell...

347
00:41:58,343 --> 00:42:00,094
is not my reflection.

348
00:42:01,429 --> 00:42:03,306
And then...

349
00:42:03,389 --> 00:42:04,724
I hear...

350
00:42:05,558 --> 00:42:07,018
this weird...

351
00:42:09,312 --> 00:42:10,647
howl...

352
00:42:11,731 --> 00:42:13,608
coming out of the sink.

353
00:42:16,194 --> 00:42:18,071
And there's a voice.

354
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,119
It's a voice...

355
00:42:25,411 --> 00:42:27,205
and it's saying...

356
00:42:27,247 --> 00:42:29,916
"Do not be afraid.

357
00:42:29,999 --> 00:42:32,252
Ninety-nine will die.

358
00:42:33,878 --> 00:42:35,338
Denver Nine".

359
00:42:37,257 --> 00:42:38,925
I even wrote it down.

360
00:42:41,344 --> 00:42:44,514
He just keeps saying the same thing
over and over for an hour...

361
00:42:44,556 --> 00:42:47,308
and then it stops.

362
00:42:47,392 --> 00:42:50,395
And when I wake up this morning
I look at this piece of paper...

363
00:42:50,478 --> 00:42:53,648
where I wrote down the words...

364
00:42:54,816 --> 00:42:57,485
and this thing is on it.

365
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,238
I did not draw that.

366
00:43:27,307 --> 00:43:29,184
- Gordon?
- What?

367
00:43:29,225 --> 00:43:32,312
Gordon, you...
your ear's bleeding.

368
00:43:32,353 --> 00:43:33,813
What?

369
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:52,791
This CAT scan is clean, Gordon.

370
00:43:52,832 --> 00:43:54,751
No sign of any physical problem.

371
00:43:54,834 --> 00:43:59,631
Are you sure?
Because this man's wife had a tumor.

372
00:43:59,672 --> 00:44:02,217
What you had, Gordon,
was a first-class migraine.

373
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:05,637
- I can write you a prescription.
- That'd be good.

374
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,223
- Thank you, Doctor.
- There were other symptoms, Doc.

375
00:44:08,264 --> 00:44:11,726
He had hallucinations, heard voices.

376
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:14,062
Aren't they both associated
with glioblastoma?

377
00:44:14,103 --> 00:44:17,232
I see nothing here to suggest...

378
00:44:17,315 --> 00:44:20,318
something as exotic
as glioblastoma, Mr. Klein...

379
00:44:20,401 --> 00:44:23,905
but if you'd like I can refer
Mr. Smallwood to another neurologist...

380
00:44:23,988 --> 00:44:25,949
for a second opinion.

381
00:44:27,075 --> 00:44:28,868
- He's wrong.
- No, that'd be fine.

382
00:44:28,952 --> 00:44:30,328
Thank you.

383
00:44:31,412 --> 00:44:33,373
Thank you very much.

384
00:44:39,087 --> 00:44:40,880
Wait. Wait.

385
00:44:40,964 --> 00:44:42,882
He's not wrong.

386
00:44:42,966 --> 00:44:45,426
Nothing's wrong.
Nothing's wrong.

387
00:44:47,428 --> 00:44:49,848
He's not wrong
'cause there's nothing wrong.

388
00:44:52,725 --> 00:44:54,144
There's nothing wrong.

389
00:45:17,459 --> 00:45:22,213
You go to a doctor with a bleeding ear
and he tells you you got a headache...

390
00:45:22,297 --> 00:45:25,717
Yes, well, you're not sick,
so that is good news.

391
00:45:25,758 --> 00:45:29,012
I wish I was sick. Then I would
know why this is happening.

392
00:45:29,137 --> 00:45:31,389
You shouldn't say things like that.

393
00:45:31,473 --> 00:45:35,727
What should I say, Denise?
I'm hallucinating.

394
00:45:35,768 --> 00:45:37,437
I'm hearing voices.

395
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,440
Was your wife hearing voices
before she had her tumor?

396
00:45:42,025 --> 00:45:43,485
No.

397
00:46:09,344 --> 00:46:14,223
13 News is headed to the scene,
and we'll have a live report in minutes.

398
00:46:14,224 --> 00:46:19,395
Again our top story, Domain Air
flight 9 out of Denver has crashed.

399
00:46:19,479 --> 00:46:23,733
An airline representative is expected
to make a statement shortly.

400
00:46:23,817 --> 00:46:25,235
There is no confirmation...

401
00:46:25,276 --> 00:46:28,321
but all 99 passengers and crew members
are believed dead.

402
00:46:38,123 --> 00:46:39,541
Wow, man.

403
00:46:48,341 --> 00:46:50,593
Could I speak to
Alexander Leek, please?

404
00:46:50,635 --> 00:46:53,263
- This is Leek.
- Mr. Leek, this is John Klein.

405
00:46:53,304 --> 00:46:55,431
I'm working on a pretty strange story.

406
00:46:55,515 --> 00:46:58,143
I was hoping you might be able
to help me out.

407
00:46:58,184 --> 00:47:02,564
I'm particularly interested in your
theories on precognition and prophecies.

408
00:47:02,647 --> 00:47:04,566
Anything you want to know
is in the book.

409
00:47:04,649 --> 00:47:09,070
Yeah, but the chapter that you have
on the entities you call...

410
00:47:09,195 --> 00:47:10,697
Were you contacted...

411
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:13,658
or are you pretending to have
a professional interest?

412
00:47:13,741 --> 00:47:15,160
Yeah... No.

413
00:47:16,202 --> 00:47:18,413
I'm a reporter
for The Washington Post.

414
00:47:18,496 --> 00:47:21,749
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Klein.
I don't work in those areas anymore.

415
00:47:23,001 --> 00:47:24,461
I don't understand.

416
00:47:37,724 --> 00:47:40,226
To hear a voice is one thing...

417
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:43,313
but this isn't just a message,
it's a prediction.

418
00:47:43,354 --> 00:47:44,898
It came true.

419
00:47:44,981 --> 00:47:49,235
These things Gordon's having,
are they dreams or hallucinations?

420
00:47:49,319 --> 00:47:52,572
The way he describes them,
they sound like dreams.

421
00:47:52,614 --> 00:47:54,032
I don't know.

422
00:47:55,617 --> 00:47:57,535
He believes they're real.

423
00:48:02,415 --> 00:48:04,334
I had a dream like that.

424
00:48:05,627 --> 00:48:07,086
Yeah?

425
00:48:11,925 --> 00:48:13,301
It was nighttime...

426
00:48:14,427 --> 00:48:16,846
and I was in the middle of the ocean.

427
00:48:19,474 --> 00:48:22,644
I was trying to swim,
but I was too cold.

428
00:48:25,271 --> 00:48:28,233
I kept looking...
I kept looking for something...

429
00:48:28,983 --> 00:48:30,610
to hang on to.

430
00:48:32,529 --> 00:48:34,697
And there were presents...

431
00:48:34,739 --> 00:48:35,990
floating all around me.

432
00:48:36,074 --> 00:48:38,535
They were wrapped up.
They were tied with bows.

433
00:48:40,078 --> 00:48:44,666
I tried to grab on to them,
but they kept popping away.

434
00:48:47,961 --> 00:48:50,088
And then I started to sink...

435
00:48:51,381 --> 00:48:52,799
like a stone.

436
00:48:55,009 --> 00:48:57,971
There was nothing I could do.
I was falling.

437
00:48:59,931 --> 00:49:01,850
But it felt good.

438
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,606
I was letting go.

439
00:49:12,777 --> 00:49:15,363
I was letting myself go...

440
00:49:15,447 --> 00:49:17,615
and...

441
00:49:17,657 --> 00:49:19,159
all I could see...

442
00:49:19,242 --> 00:49:20,660
was black...

443
00:49:20,743 --> 00:49:24,247
and all I could feel
was the darkness above me...

444
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:26,249
and the lights...

445
00:49:26,291 --> 00:49:28,209
coming from below.

446
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:33,798
I knew I was dying.

447
00:49:37,177 --> 00:49:42,432
And then I heard this voice,
like somebody whispering in my ear.

448
00:49:42,515 --> 00:49:44,809
"Wake up, number 37".

449
00:49:53,985 --> 00:49:55,904
And then I woke up.

450
00:50:00,658 --> 00:50:02,577
What do you think that means?

451
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:05,789
Number 37?

452
00:50:06,456 --> 00:50:08,374
I have absolutely no idea.

453
00:50:41,991 --> 00:50:43,868
I met him.

454
00:50:44,577 --> 00:50:47,789
The guy who told me
about the plane crash.

455
00:50:49,624 --> 00:50:52,127
You met him?

456
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:53,128
Yeah.

457
00:50:53,878 --> 00:50:55,713
I met him.

458
00:50:56,297 --> 00:50:59,050
Last night, coming home
from work about midnight.

459
00:50:59,134 --> 00:51:02,095
I'm driving past the cement plant...

460
00:51:02,178 --> 00:51:05,348
out by the chemical factory.

461
00:51:05,473 --> 00:51:06,516
Right.

462
00:51:06,641 --> 00:51:08,560
Something happened.

463
00:51:15,567 --> 00:51:16,985
Bright...

464
00:51:17,026 --> 00:51:18,403
flash.

465
00:51:18,486 --> 00:51:19,529
Lightning.

466
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:24,868
Something...

467
00:51:25,493 --> 00:51:26,411
encircles me.

468
00:51:32,959 --> 00:51:34,294
Everything's kind of hot.

469
00:51:36,838 --> 00:51:38,965
I feel like I can't catch...

470
00:51:40,383 --> 00:51:41,843
catch my breath.

471
00:52:16,294 --> 00:52:17,754
He looked human.

472
00:52:19,255 --> 00:52:21,591
But there was just something...

473
00:52:21,674 --> 00:52:23,134
wrong about him.

474
00:52:25,428 --> 00:52:27,347
That's when I heard the voice.

475
00:52:28,139 --> 00:52:30,308
The same voice
that I heard two nights ago.

476
00:52:31,059 --> 00:52:32,811
He said...

477
00:52:32,852 --> 00:52:34,813
"Do not be afraid.

478
00:52:36,064 --> 00:52:37,649
My name...

479
00:52:37,732 --> 00:52:40,693
is Indrid Cold".

480
00:52:46,116 --> 00:52:47,659
And he said to me...

481
00:52:47,784 --> 00:52:49,744
"In a place this size.

482
00:52:49,786 --> 00:52:52,288
Equator.

483
00:52:52,372 --> 00:52:54,332
Three hundred.

484
00:52:54,374 --> 00:52:57,210
Three hundred will die.

485
00:53:00,004 --> 00:53:01,589
Wait for me.

486
00:53:02,715 --> 00:53:04,134
I will return.

487
00:53:05,635 --> 00:53:07,679
I will see you in time".

488
00:53:13,476 --> 00:53:15,103
And that was it.

489
00:53:18,982 --> 00:53:20,441
It's a little...

490
00:53:26,781 --> 00:53:28,825
Have a look.

491
00:54:08,531 --> 00:54:09,991
She knew.

492
00:54:12,285 --> 00:54:13,745
I didn't see anything.

493
00:54:33,598 --> 00:54:37,143
You want to hear
the chief's latest phone call?

494
00:55:06,714 --> 00:55:07,966
Yes?

495
00:55:08,049 --> 00:55:09,759
- Thank God you're there.
- Gordon?

496
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,054
I know I sounded crazy the other day,
but things are getting weird out here.

497
00:55:13,138 --> 00:55:14,430
Slow down, Gordon.

498
00:55:14,514 --> 00:55:15,932
- He's here.
- Who's here?

499
00:55:16,015 --> 00:55:19,602
Indrid Cold.
He's standing right next to me.

500
00:55:19,686 --> 00:55:23,148
Get over to Gordon's right away.
He says Indrid Cold is there.

501
00:55:24,399 --> 00:55:27,610
Gordon, let me talk to him.

502
00:55:28,903 --> 00:55:30,989
Sure. Hang on.

503
00:55:32,323 --> 00:55:33,783
Hello, John Klein.

504
00:55:35,535 --> 00:55:37,537
Who is this?

505
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:40,165
My name is Indrid Cold.

506
00:55:44,586 --> 00:55:46,546
Unless, of course,
you're Gordon Smallwood.

507
00:55:46,629 --> 00:55:51,009
Your father was born
in Racine, Wisconsin.

508
00:55:51,092 --> 00:55:54,053
He lived in a green house
on Monroe Street.

509
00:55:55,972 --> 00:55:58,892
You don't remember
how your mother looked.

510
00:56:01,102 --> 00:56:03,021
Okay, you got my attention.

511
00:56:11,529 --> 00:56:13,823
- Where's my watch?
- In your shoe.

512
00:56:15,742 --> 00:56:16,993
Under the bed.

513
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:44,687
Very good, John.
Thank you.

514
00:56:46,773 --> 00:56:49,108
What's in my hand?

515
00:56:50,735 --> 00:56:52,028
Chap Stick.

516
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,786
You're reading my mind, aren't you?

517
00:56:59,869 --> 00:57:01,412
Did you read my mind?

518
00:57:01,496 --> 00:57:04,582
I have no need to, do I?

519
00:57:08,586 --> 00:57:12,090
What's the third line of page 51?

520
00:57:13,925 --> 00:57:18,346
"A broken smile
beneath her whispered wings".

521
00:57:20,223 --> 00:57:22,308
Still more proof, John Klein?

522
00:57:28,231 --> 00:57:30,275
What do you look like?

523
00:57:30,358 --> 00:57:33,570
It depends on who's looking.

524
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:38,241
I want to meet you.

525
00:57:38,283 --> 00:57:40,743
You already have, John.

526
00:57:40,827 --> 00:57:43,580
I have seen you afraid.

527
00:57:43,705 --> 00:57:46,082
You're afraid right now, aren't you?

528
00:57:48,751 --> 00:57:51,713
Can I ask you something?

529
00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:55,758
Why ask me
what you already know, John?

530
00:58:03,308 --> 00:58:05,226
What happened to my wife?

531
00:58:06,352 --> 00:58:07,604
You were there.

532
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:12,817
Mary Klein cannot be found by looking.

533
00:58:12,901 --> 00:58:15,278
You will see her in time.

534
00:58:39,135 --> 00:58:41,346
What's up, Connie?

535
00:58:41,429 --> 00:58:43,556
Everything okay?

536
00:58:44,849 --> 00:58:46,851
Did you just call John?

537
00:58:48,144 --> 00:58:50,104
I've been asleep since 9:00.

538
00:59:03,368 --> 00:59:06,538
Unless, of course,
you're Gordon Smallwood.

539
00:59:06,621 --> 00:59:11,376
See? It's sticking up here
around 1,950 cycles per second.

540
00:59:11,417 --> 00:59:16,005
But it never gets any lower
than maybe 1,930 or so.

541
00:59:17,048 --> 00:59:20,009
But yours is way down here
in the normal vocal range...

542
00:59:20,093 --> 00:59:23,721
anywhere between 1,000
and 1,200 cycles per second.

543
00:59:23,847 --> 00:59:27,267
Okay, so this guy's vocal range
is much higher than mine.

544
00:59:28,309 --> 00:59:30,895
What makes you think it's a man?

545
00:59:30,979 --> 00:59:32,730
Still more proof, John Klein?

546
00:59:40,405 --> 00:59:41,990
What is it?

547
00:59:42,866 --> 00:59:45,618
Near as I can tell, it's...

548
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:47,036
an electrical impulse.

549
00:59:51,249 --> 00:59:54,461
But whatever it is, it's not
coming from human vocal cords.

550
00:59:54,502 --> 00:59:57,046
Why ask me
what you already know, John?

551
00:59:57,172 --> 00:59:58,882
What happened to my wife?

552
01:00:00,717 --> 01:00:02,135
You were there.

553
01:00:03,511 --> 01:00:06,681
Mary Klein cannot be found by looking.

554
01:00:06,764 --> 01:00:09,184
You will see her in time.

555
01:00:13,688 --> 01:00:18,151
This isn't like you. We used to rip on
this stuff, when it came over the wire.

556
01:00:18,193 --> 01:00:19,319
Yeah, I know.

557
01:00:19,402 --> 01:00:23,072
- It's different when it happens to you.
- Do me a favor.

558
01:00:23,156 --> 01:00:26,201
Talk to Cyrus today.
Tell him you got the flu. Any excuse.

559
01:00:26,284 --> 01:00:27,660
I'll back you up.

560
01:00:27,702 --> 01:00:30,371
I just wanna make sure
you still got a job...

561
01:00:30,497 --> 01:00:34,000
when you're done doing
whatever it is you're doing down there.

562
01:00:34,125 --> 01:00:36,085
Okay, I'll call you from Chicago.

563
01:00:40,173 --> 01:00:41,424
What time is your flight?

564
01:00:43,676 --> 01:00:45,136
8:00 a.m.

565
01:00:49,224 --> 01:00:50,475
Am I crazy?

566
01:00:54,312 --> 01:00:55,396
No.

567
01:00:59,776 --> 01:01:01,444
I am crazy.

568
01:01:43,987 --> 01:01:45,989
Alexander Leek.

569
01:01:48,616 --> 01:01:52,036
- Who the hell are you?
- John Klein. I called you last week.

570
01:01:53,329 --> 01:01:55,248
Do you know what that is?

571
01:01:57,792 --> 01:01:59,210
Stay away.

572
01:02:01,296 --> 01:02:04,257
I need to know what this is.
Tell me.

573
01:02:07,469 --> 01:02:09,471
Where are they seeing it?

574
01:02:09,512 --> 01:02:11,473
Point Pleasant, West Virginia.

575
01:02:14,934 --> 01:02:16,853
You can help me.

576
01:02:19,898 --> 01:02:21,316
Follow me.

577
01:02:27,947 --> 01:02:30,325
The nocturnal butterfly.

578
01:02:30,408 --> 01:02:34,579
In ancient cultures, the moth
represents a form of the psyche...

579
01:02:34,662 --> 01:02:37,415
or the soul immortally trapped...

580
01:02:37,457 --> 01:02:41,044
in the hellish death realms.

581
01:02:43,046 --> 01:02:44,464
Mothman.

582
01:02:46,758 --> 01:02:50,678
That's what the Ukrainians called him.
Rough translation, of course.

583
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:54,974
There were 100 sightings in Chernobyl
the year the nuclear plant went down.

584
01:02:55,058 --> 01:02:58,311
Galveston, 1969,
just before the hurricane.

585
01:02:58,353 --> 01:02:59,813
They saw it.

586
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:03,858
But seeing isn't always believing.

587
01:03:06,986 --> 01:03:09,906
Look, there's never been
a single shred of evidence...

588
01:03:09,989 --> 01:03:14,744
to show that these things
exist materially.

589
01:03:14,869 --> 01:03:17,622
So you're telling me
these things do not exist?

590
01:03:17,705 --> 01:03:22,502
Oh, they exist. All kinds of things
exist around us that we never see.

591
01:03:22,585 --> 01:03:26,339
Electricity, microwaves,
infrared waves.

592
01:03:26,422 --> 01:03:29,717
You know, these things
have been around forever.

593
01:03:29,801 --> 01:03:32,929
They show up in cave paintings.

594
01:03:33,012 --> 01:03:35,515
They're a normal condition
of the planet.

595
01:03:37,809 --> 01:03:41,938
They're just not part of our consensus
of what constitutes...

596
01:03:43,231 --> 01:03:45,108
physical reality.

597
01:03:45,191 --> 01:03:47,444
What are they part of, then?

598
01:03:49,362 --> 01:03:52,323
You're asking for an explanation...

599
01:03:52,449 --> 01:03:53,867
for something...

600
01:03:56,119 --> 01:03:59,497
that can't be explained rationally.

601
01:04:05,795 --> 01:04:08,840
You know the buildup of energy
before something happens?

602
01:04:09,632 --> 01:04:12,385
The way your hair stands up
before lightning strikes?

603
01:04:12,427 --> 01:04:16,723
"Before something happens".
Do you mean they cause disasters?

604
01:04:17,557 --> 01:04:19,392
Why would they need to?

605
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:22,187
All right, then...

606
01:04:22,270 --> 01:04:24,272
are they trying to warn me?

607
01:04:27,776 --> 01:04:29,527
Their motivations...

608
01:04:31,112 --> 01:04:32,530
aren't human.

609
01:04:35,533 --> 01:04:37,869
All right, then what do they want?

610
01:04:37,952 --> 01:04:39,871
I have no idea.

611
01:04:41,331 --> 01:04:43,374
What you really want is to know...

612
01:04:45,126 --> 01:04:46,544
why you?

613
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,298
Yes.

614
01:04:52,425 --> 01:04:56,012
You noticed them,
and they noticed that you noticed them.

615
01:04:58,181 --> 01:05:01,518
Most people aren't sensitive enough
to see them...

616
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:04,229
without some kind of...

617
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:08,358
trauma.

618
01:05:10,985 --> 01:05:13,196
What happened to you, Mr. Klein?

619
01:05:17,867 --> 01:05:20,954
Last week my friend
got a strange phone call...

620
01:05:21,037 --> 01:05:23,164
from an entity...

621
01:05:24,415 --> 01:05:26,000
a spirit, whatever.

622
01:05:27,877 --> 01:05:29,921
It seemed to know everything.

623
01:05:30,046 --> 01:05:31,464
Like God?

624
01:05:31,548 --> 01:05:34,801
- It made predictions that came true?
- Yes.

625
01:05:34,884 --> 01:05:37,303
His name was Indrid Cold.

626
01:05:37,387 --> 01:05:41,516
It's perception, John.
They appear differently to everyone.

627
01:05:41,558 --> 01:05:44,811
A voice, a light, a man, a monster.

628
01:05:44,894 --> 01:05:49,566
If your friend thinks it's God he spoke
to, he's off by more than a few degrees.

629
01:05:49,649 --> 01:05:52,068
Then how do you explain
that it knows everything?

630
01:05:53,945 --> 01:05:55,196
Look at that.

631
01:05:56,114 --> 01:06:00,910
If there was a car crash 10 blocks away,
that window washer could likely see it.

632
01:06:00,994 --> 01:06:03,955
That doesn't mean he's God...

633
01:06:04,038 --> 01:06:05,957
or even smarter than we are.

634
01:06:07,292 --> 01:06:10,086
But from where he's sitting...

635
01:06:10,128 --> 01:06:13,089
he can see
a little further down the road.

636
01:06:14,215 --> 01:06:16,968
I think we can assume that...

637
01:06:17,051 --> 01:06:18,970
these entities
are more advanced than us.

638
01:06:19,053 --> 01:06:23,641
Why don't they just come right out
and tell us what's on their minds?

639
01:06:23,725 --> 01:06:25,727
You're more advanced than a cockroach.

640
01:06:25,768 --> 01:06:28,730
Have you ever tried explaining yourself
to one of them?

641
01:06:33,276 --> 01:06:35,945
How many people have seen it?

642
01:06:36,070 --> 01:06:37,989
Ten. Twenty, maybe.

643
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:46,581
Listen to me. Something terrible
is going to happen in Point Pleasant.

644
01:06:48,166 --> 01:06:49,751
Don't go back.

645
01:06:51,211 --> 01:06:52,670
Stay away.

646
01:06:55,006 --> 01:06:57,050
I can't talk about this anymore.

647
01:07:07,685 --> 01:07:09,646
There is a reason...

648
01:07:09,771 --> 01:07:11,815
that I ended up in Point Pleasant.

649
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:15,652
Something brought me there.

650
01:07:15,777 --> 01:07:17,779
Whatever brought you there...

651
01:07:19,364 --> 01:07:21,282
brought you there to die.

652
01:08:05,535 --> 01:08:08,830
You're just in time. They're just
about to light this Christmas tree.

653
01:08:08,913 --> 01:08:11,332
They have been for the last two hours.

654
01:08:12,667 --> 01:08:14,711
Isn't that Denise?

655
01:08:14,794 --> 01:08:16,754
Is she okay?

656
01:08:16,838 --> 01:08:18,256
She left Gordon.

657
01:08:19,799 --> 01:08:22,802
He got fired from the chemical plant.
Just stopped coming to work one day.

658
01:08:22,886 --> 01:08:23,845
Shit.

659
01:08:25,263 --> 01:08:28,057
- Where is he?
- Who knows?

660
01:08:31,102 --> 01:08:33,354
Be back in a second.

661
01:08:37,317 --> 01:08:39,319
Connie.

662
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:40,779
What's wrong?

663
01:08:42,447 --> 01:08:45,408
Fifteen more people
reported seeing that thing today.

664
01:08:45,450 --> 01:08:47,702
Fifteen.
Three of them were cops.

665
01:08:50,371 --> 01:08:53,416
I hate this, John.
I absolutely goddamn hate this.

666
01:09:00,548 --> 01:09:02,467
How was Chicago?

667
01:09:06,012 --> 01:09:07,972
What did he say?

668
01:09:10,058 --> 01:09:11,976
He wouldn't see me.

669
01:09:30,411 --> 01:09:32,330
Shit.

670
01:09:57,772 --> 01:09:59,232
You all right?

671
01:10:06,322 --> 01:10:08,867
It's cold.
Get in the car, warm up.

672
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:11,453
I can't.
I'm waiting for him.

673
01:10:16,666 --> 01:10:20,837
Everybody in this town is looking at me
like I'm insane. You know why?

674
01:10:23,882 --> 01:10:28,636
Denise and all the others,
they don't know, John.

675
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,180
I do.

676
01:10:34,767 --> 01:10:36,686
I don't think you're crazy.

677
01:10:36,769 --> 01:10:38,396
Okay?

678
01:10:38,438 --> 01:10:40,857
You talked to him too, John.

679
01:10:44,736 --> 01:10:46,196
You know...

680
01:10:46,237 --> 01:10:49,157
I've been lying awake at night.

681
01:10:50,408 --> 01:10:51,868
I feel...

682
01:10:53,411 --> 01:10:55,038
like I'm sleeping...

683
01:10:56,122 --> 01:10:57,582
but I'm awake.

684
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:03,004
That's when I hear him.

685
01:11:03,129 --> 01:11:05,548
And lately, when I hear him...

686
01:11:06,966 --> 01:11:08,426
all at once...

687
01:11:11,304 --> 01:11:12,889
I understand.

688
01:11:16,935 --> 01:11:18,353
Everything.

689
01:11:22,607 --> 01:11:27,195
John, do you remember
the last time you were happy?

690
01:11:42,794 --> 01:11:44,254
It's real.

691
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:49,300
These things are real.

692
01:12:19,038 --> 01:12:21,124
I want you to be happy.

693
01:12:31,843 --> 01:12:33,303
Yeah?

694
01:12:35,972 --> 01:12:37,557
What?

695
01:12:37,599 --> 01:12:40,560
This is your wake-up call,
Mr. Klein.

696
01:12:40,643 --> 01:12:43,062
I didn't ask for a wake-up call.

697
01:13:28,191 --> 01:13:31,152
What happened to you, Mr. Klein?

698
01:13:41,121 --> 01:13:43,039
I can't believe I got through.

699
01:13:44,207 --> 01:13:46,209
Gordon, where are you, man?

700
01:13:46,251 --> 01:13:47,752
Speak up.

701
01:13:47,836 --> 01:13:50,588
Listen, John, he was right.

702
01:13:50,672 --> 01:13:53,007
Mr. Cold was right
about everything.

703
01:13:53,091 --> 01:13:56,386
Right? Right about what?
I can't hear you.

704
01:13:56,427 --> 01:13:58,346
He was right about understanding.

705
01:13:59,472 --> 01:14:02,225
It's real, John.
I want you to know.

706
01:14:02,267 --> 01:14:05,520
- It's real.
- What is... What are you talking about?

707
01:14:05,562 --> 01:14:08,898
You've got nothing to worry about.

708
01:14:08,982 --> 01:14:10,900
I'll see you in time.

709
01:14:37,677 --> 01:14:38,970
Gordon?

710
01:16:14,607 --> 01:16:17,026
Can they tell how long
he was out there?

711
01:16:17,110 --> 01:16:20,363
Looks like he's been dead
about eight hours.

712
01:16:21,781 --> 01:16:23,741
He died of exposure.

713
01:16:25,702 --> 01:16:27,912
What made you come out here?

714
01:16:32,792 --> 01:16:35,086
- He called me.
- When?

715
01:16:35,879 --> 01:16:37,839
I didn't like the way he sounded.

716
01:16:37,964 --> 01:16:40,383
When did he call you, John?

717
01:16:45,513 --> 01:16:46,973
About an hour ago.

718
01:16:49,642 --> 01:16:51,060
I can't stand this.

719
01:17:37,148 --> 01:17:40,485
It didn't seem right
to bring this up at the funeral...

720
01:17:40,568 --> 01:17:43,947
but as far as I know there's never been
any accidents at the chemical plant.

721
01:17:44,823 --> 01:17:46,699
I don't know
what you're talking about.

722
01:17:46,783 --> 01:17:51,788
I got your message the other day.
I meant to call you back, but I forgot.

723
01:17:54,207 --> 01:17:56,793
Don't you remember
leaving me that message?

724
01:17:56,876 --> 01:17:59,420
Chief, this is John Klein.

725
01:17:59,504 --> 01:18:01,714
I didn't call him.
No, it's not me.

726
01:18:01,756 --> 01:18:04,592
I analyzed both tapes
with the voice print.

727
01:18:04,676 --> 01:18:08,096
I don't care.
It may be my voice. It's not me.

728
01:18:08,179 --> 01:18:10,557
- It is not me.
- Listen to me.

729
01:18:10,598 --> 01:18:14,102
I would swear in a court of law
that that's your voice.

730
01:18:14,185 --> 01:18:16,229
Yeah, great. Thanks.

731
01:18:17,939 --> 01:18:18,857
Shit!

732
01:18:48,136 --> 01:18:50,305
Regular coffee to go, please.

733
01:18:51,097 --> 01:18:52,140
Seventy-five cents.

734
01:18:55,226 --> 01:18:57,187
Have a great day.

735
01:19:07,447 --> 01:19:08,865
Do you know that woman?

736
01:19:10,325 --> 01:19:13,328
- What woman?
- She just left. You didn't see her?

737
01:19:13,411 --> 01:19:15,370
- No.
- That's strange.

738
01:19:15,371 --> 01:19:19,876
She had long red hair, green eyes, real
pretty, and she was asking about you.

739
01:19:36,309 --> 01:19:38,895
- Did you see which way she went?
- No.

740
01:19:40,146 --> 01:19:43,691
- What did she say?
- She asked a lot of strange questions.

741
01:19:43,775 --> 01:19:47,237
What are you doing here?
And she asked if you were happy.

742
01:19:49,405 --> 01:19:52,408
- What did you say?
- I asked her for some ID.

743
01:19:52,450 --> 01:19:53,910
- Did she give you any?
- No.

744
01:19:53,993 --> 01:19:58,414
She just said "Tell John I'm sorry for
ruining everything", and then she left.

745
01:20:00,917 --> 01:20:02,043
What's wrong?

746
01:20:06,631 --> 01:20:07,549
Was it her?

747
01:20:08,508 --> 01:20:09,467
Was it her?

748
01:20:12,512 --> 01:20:13,888
That's your wife?

749
01:20:14,556 --> 01:20:15,974
It was her.

750
01:20:17,183 --> 01:20:19,561
- I'm not sure.
- What?

751
01:20:19,602 --> 01:20:21,271
I mean, the hair is different.

752
01:20:21,354 --> 01:20:23,565
- Oh, come on!
- What?

753
01:20:23,648 --> 01:20:27,152
- This is the woman you saw.
- No, it isn't, John.

754
01:20:27,235 --> 01:20:29,779
Now, I agree there is a similarity...

755
01:20:29,904 --> 01:20:31,156
Bullshit!

756
01:20:36,828 --> 01:20:38,413
John, it's all right.

757
01:20:38,455 --> 01:20:40,415
I'm not all right.

758
01:20:42,959 --> 01:20:46,379
This is the woman you saw.
She was here. This woman.

759
01:20:51,092 --> 01:20:53,011
Don't you do this to me.

760
01:21:46,564 --> 01:21:48,483
I'm sorry, John.

761
01:21:48,525 --> 01:21:50,985
I feel like I've ruined everything.

762
01:21:51,069 --> 01:21:52,821
I feel like I've ruined everything.

763
01:21:58,952 --> 01:22:00,328
I'm so sorry.

764
01:22:36,781 --> 01:22:39,284
I need to know what happened to you.

765
01:22:40,702 --> 01:22:43,079
Please.

766
01:22:43,163 --> 01:22:44,622
Come in.

767
01:22:50,086 --> 01:22:54,007
I was a physics professor at Cornell.

768
01:22:54,090 --> 01:22:56,801
Tenured.
You can look me up.

769
01:22:57,886 --> 01:23:00,680
One day I started hearing voices.

770
01:23:02,348 --> 01:23:05,101
The voices became messages.

771
01:23:05,143 --> 01:23:08,229
Before long, I was fully convinced
that I was receiving...

772
01:23:08,313 --> 01:23:12,192
predictions of disaster
from outside intelligences.

773
01:23:12,233 --> 01:23:13,735
But you were, weren't you?

774
01:23:13,818 --> 01:23:16,237
John, I had tapes of their voices.

775
01:23:17,655 --> 01:23:21,075
I knew a building was going to blow up,
and I tried to prevent it...

776
01:23:21,201 --> 01:23:24,370
but no one listened.

777
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,874
What happened?

778
01:23:27,916 --> 01:23:29,292
People died.

779
01:23:33,254 --> 01:23:35,256
Many people died.

780
01:23:37,550 --> 01:23:40,720
I was investigated, almost arrested.

781
01:23:42,347 --> 01:23:44,265
My wife divorced me.

782
01:23:45,558 --> 01:23:47,769
My kids...

783
01:23:47,852 --> 01:23:50,063
stopped speaking to me.

784
01:23:54,442 --> 01:23:58,154
Do you know what four years in
a psychiatric hospital can do to you?

785
01:24:00,198 --> 01:24:02,075
Everything...

786
01:24:02,158 --> 01:24:03,993
gone.

787
01:24:05,286 --> 01:24:08,540
Oh, you'll never understand
their messages.

788
01:24:08,623 --> 01:24:10,834
You'll misinterpret them.

789
01:24:10,917 --> 01:24:13,586
I did.
It almost destroyed me.

790
01:24:13,670 --> 01:24:16,798
In the end,
it all came down to just...

791
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:18,925
one simple question.

792
01:24:19,717 --> 01:24:22,262
Which was more important...

793
01:24:22,345 --> 01:24:24,347
having proof...

794
01:24:26,433 --> 01:24:28,351
or being alive?

795
01:24:32,439 --> 01:24:33,606
Trust me.

796
01:24:33,690 --> 01:24:36,484
I turned away years ago...

797
01:24:36,568 --> 01:24:38,820
and I've never looked back.

798
01:24:41,948 --> 01:24:44,325
Didn't you need to know?

799
01:24:49,956 --> 01:24:52,125
We're not allowed to know.

800
01:26:34,769 --> 01:26:37,230
It's me, Cyrus.

801
01:26:37,272 --> 01:26:39,274
John, is that you?

802
01:26:39,399 --> 01:26:40,984
Yeah.

803
01:26:41,109 --> 01:26:42,152
Yeah, it's me.

804
01:26:42,277 --> 01:26:44,612
Whatever you are doing, you drop it.

805
01:26:44,654 --> 01:26:46,614
Governor McCallum
is going to Charleston.

806
01:26:46,656 --> 01:26:49,617
Then he's touring that chemical plant
in Point Pleasant today.

807
01:26:49,701 --> 01:26:52,495
Now, I want you to go down there...

808
01:26:52,579 --> 01:26:54,789
and meet him at the airport.

809
01:26:56,833 --> 01:26:59,169
You listening?

810
01:26:59,252 --> 01:27:01,754
Yeah, McCal I...
at the chemical plant. Got it.

811
01:27:01,838 --> 01:27:04,674
I need to know that
you're gonna be there.

812
01:27:04,757 --> 01:27:06,676
John, are you there?

813
01:27:23,109 --> 01:27:24,611
Ohio.

814
01:27:24,694 --> 01:27:29,491
Great tragedy on the River Ohio.

815
01:27:30,909 --> 01:27:35,872
Great tragedy on the River Ohio.

816
01:27:41,336 --> 01:27:44,631
I can't call in sick just because
you have a bad feeling about today.

817
01:27:44,756 --> 01:27:48,718
Just think about this.
Gordon saw weird lights in the sky.

818
01:27:48,843 --> 01:27:50,762
They show up over the chemical plant.

819
01:27:50,845 --> 01:27:53,014
Josh gets a call from me,
but it's not really me.

820
01:27:53,098 --> 01:27:57,477
I'm talking about something bad
happening at the chemical plant.

821
01:27:57,560 --> 01:28:00,480
Then I get this message
from this Indrid Cold...

822
01:28:00,563 --> 01:28:04,192
who's talking about
a great tragedy on the Ohio River.

823
01:28:05,276 --> 01:28:07,654
Guess what's on the Ohio River.

824
01:28:07,737 --> 01:28:09,280
The chemical plant.

825
01:28:10,573 --> 01:28:13,743
Today Governor McCallum
is gonna be there.

826
01:28:13,827 --> 01:28:16,579
I was on my way to interview him.
That's how I ended...

827
01:28:21,292 --> 01:28:23,711
That's how I ended up here.

828
01:28:27,215 --> 01:28:28,925
My God.

829
01:28:29,008 --> 01:28:31,052
That's why I'm here.

830
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:34,222
He was right.

831
01:28:34,931 --> 01:28:36,891
Who was right?

832
01:28:39,352 --> 01:28:41,479
You saw Leek.

833
01:28:41,563 --> 01:28:43,648
- He was part of the warning.
- What?

834
01:28:43,731 --> 01:28:46,818
He was part of the warning.
Stop, stop, stop.

835
01:28:46,901 --> 01:28:49,195
I didn't want to scare you.

836
01:28:51,698 --> 01:28:53,074
He said...

837
01:28:54,242 --> 01:28:56,202
He said the messages are real.

838
01:28:57,996 --> 01:29:00,248
Something terrible is gonna happen.

839
01:29:02,542 --> 01:29:03,960
Connie, please.

840
01:29:07,172 --> 01:29:09,257
We have to leave here now.

841
01:29:09,340 --> 01:29:11,301
I will not live my life like that.

842
01:29:11,342 --> 01:29:15,722
I will not make decisions based
on messages from Indrid Cold.

843
01:29:15,764 --> 01:29:17,640
He may be real to you.
He's not real to me.

844
01:29:20,268 --> 01:29:22,228
Okay, I'm going to Charleston.

845
01:29:22,312 --> 01:29:24,272
I'll be at the Marriott.
Get yourself reassigned.

846
01:29:24,355 --> 01:29:26,274
I don't want you anywhere
near the plant today.

847
01:29:26,357 --> 01:29:27,817
What if nothing happens?

848
01:29:29,736 --> 01:29:33,072
What if there's no great tragedy?
What'll you do then?

849
01:29:33,156 --> 01:29:35,283
- That's not the point.
- Well, I think it is the point.

850
01:29:35,366 --> 01:29:38,661
- Gordon believed what he heard too.
- I am not Gordon!

851
01:29:40,705 --> 01:29:43,291
I know what's gonna happen.

852
01:29:45,502 --> 01:29:47,879
You have to leave now.

853
01:29:47,962 --> 01:29:51,674
I have to report to work.
We can talk about this later.

854
01:30:26,209 --> 01:30:28,503
- Governor?
- Good to see you, John.

855
01:30:28,586 --> 01:30:30,964
I need to speak with you.
It's urgent.

856
01:30:31,047 --> 01:30:33,424
- What's this about, John?
- It's the tour.

857
01:30:33,508 --> 01:30:35,176
You can't do it. You can't go.

858
01:30:36,219 --> 01:30:39,264
Listen to me.
Cancel it. Cancel the tour.

859
01:30:39,347 --> 01:30:42,809
Cancel it. Make them
shut down the plant now.

860
01:30:42,892 --> 01:30:44,811
The plant's gonna blow up
while you're there.

861
01:30:46,062 --> 01:30:48,731
Where are the cops?
What are they doing?

862
01:30:48,815 --> 01:30:50,900
- This is McCallum's chief aide.
- They don't know yet.

863
01:30:50,984 --> 01:30:53,236
Have you received a bomb threat?

864
01:30:53,319 --> 01:30:56,531
I didn't say anything about a bomb.
There's a source.

865
01:30:56,573 --> 01:31:00,034
- I know this sounds...
- You're messing up here, John.

866
01:31:03,788 --> 01:31:06,583
Get me Cyrus Bills at the Post.

867
01:31:16,676 --> 01:31:19,763
Our top story takes us tonight
to Point Pleasant...

868
01:31:19,846 --> 01:31:22,766
- where Virginia Governor McCallum...
- Turn it up!

869
01:31:22,849 --> 01:31:24,934
...toured the Edgewater
Petrochemical plant.

870
01:31:25,018 --> 01:31:27,353
In what he's called
a successful review...

871
01:31:27,437 --> 01:31:31,024
Governor McCallum has given
high marks to this petrochemical plant.

872
01:31:31,107 --> 01:31:33,985
He is expected to call
for similar renovations...

873
01:31:34,068 --> 01:31:36,196
at several Virginia plants.

874
01:31:36,279 --> 01:31:38,615
WOWK-TV 13...

875
01:31:38,698 --> 01:31:42,243
has an exclusive look inside
at what the governor saw.

876
01:31:42,368 --> 01:31:43,703
Son of a bitch.

877
01:31:43,787 --> 01:31:47,207
I congratulate my friends
at Edgewater Petrochemical...

878
01:31:47,248 --> 01:31:49,584
on a job well done.

879
01:31:50,794 --> 01:31:52,420
- Success here at Point Pleasant...
- Excuse me, Mr. Klein.

880
01:31:52,462 --> 01:31:54,422
You have a message.

881
01:32:21,658 --> 01:32:23,076
Come in.

882
01:32:33,962 --> 01:32:35,922
- Back to Washington?
- Yeah.

883
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:39,259
- Do you have to go?
- I have to go.

884
01:32:41,845 --> 01:32:44,973
- If this is about today...
- No, it's not.

885
01:32:46,516 --> 01:32:48,435
I got a message.

886
01:32:50,061 --> 01:32:52,522
I have to go home.

887
01:32:52,605 --> 01:32:55,692
I have to be there noon on Friday.

888
01:32:55,733 --> 01:32:57,986
John, do you realize
what's happening to you?

889
01:33:02,907 --> 01:33:05,034
I have to go.

890
01:34:29,536 --> 01:34:31,454
Hey, it's me.

891
01:34:33,081 --> 01:34:35,041
- Connie?
- Yeah.

892
01:34:35,083 --> 01:34:38,837
I thought we could chat
for, say, 10 or 15 minutes.

893
01:34:44,968 --> 01:34:47,971
- I'm sorry. Can I call you back?
- No, you can't.

894
01:34:49,139 --> 01:34:51,891
- I booked you a flight.
- What?

895
01:34:51,975 --> 01:34:54,936
It leaves Dulles
for Columbus, Ohio at 1:45.

896
01:34:57,272 --> 01:35:01,568
I tried to get you on the one to
Charleston, but they're all booked up.

897
01:35:01,651 --> 01:35:04,154
So if you leave now,
you'll just make it.

898
01:35:04,237 --> 01:35:05,947
I can't.

899
01:35:08,867 --> 01:35:11,411
It's Christmas Eve, John.

900
01:35:11,494 --> 01:35:13,455
You shouldn't be alone.

901
01:35:18,126 --> 01:35:19,294
I can't.

902
01:35:19,377 --> 01:35:21,296
Yeah, you can.

903
01:35:23,298 --> 01:35:24,757
You know...

904
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:28,553
when Mary got sick...

905
01:35:28,636 --> 01:35:30,805
I couldn't help thinking...

906
01:35:30,889 --> 01:35:32,766
this isn't real.

907
01:35:33,892 --> 01:35:36,144
I can stop this.

908
01:35:36,227 --> 01:35:38,605
I know I can.
I can stop this.

909
01:35:39,606 --> 01:35:42,066
No one can stop it, John.

910
01:35:43,151 --> 01:35:45,069
Listen to me.

911
01:35:46,154 --> 01:35:49,908
Planes are going to crash.
Earthquakes are going to happen.

912
01:35:49,991 --> 01:35:52,327
People you know and love
are going to die...

913
01:35:52,410 --> 01:35:55,747
and no matter what
that voice tells you...

914
01:35:55,830 --> 01:35:59,125
there's nothing you can do about it.

915
01:36:01,377 --> 01:36:03,922
It's two years to the day.

916
01:36:05,006 --> 01:36:09,135
He told me that she's going to call.
He said that Mary's going to call.

917
01:36:09,219 --> 01:36:10,428
He's lying.

918
01:36:12,639 --> 01:36:15,809
Whoever calls may sound like her...

919
01:36:15,892 --> 01:36:18,019
but it's not gonna be her.

920
01:36:19,104 --> 01:36:21,689
I don't know what happens to us
after we die...

921
01:36:21,773 --> 01:36:24,400
but I'll bet you
wherever Mary is now...

922
01:36:24,484 --> 01:36:27,070
she's nowhere near Indrid Cold.

923
01:36:29,364 --> 01:36:31,282
What if it is her?

924
01:36:36,663 --> 01:36:38,581
She's dead, John.

925
01:36:40,875 --> 01:36:44,838
The only important question now is
how do you want to remember her?

926
01:36:49,592 --> 01:36:51,177
I miss her so much.

927
01:36:51,261 --> 01:36:54,013
I know you do.
Of course you do.

928
01:36:54,055 --> 01:36:56,015
But, John, listen...

929
01:36:57,142 --> 01:37:00,145
you can miss her here
just as easily as there.

930
01:37:00,228 --> 01:37:03,565
Even more easily because there,
you're all alone.

931
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:08,403
And that's just no way to be.

932
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:14,701
You do whatever you need to do...

933
01:37:14,784 --> 01:37:16,703
and I'll understand.

934
01:37:18,163 --> 01:37:21,166
But here,
we have dinner at 6:00...

935
01:37:22,375 --> 01:37:24,627
and we open presents at 8:00.

936
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:28,840
And we hope we see you.

937
01:37:31,301 --> 01:37:32,719
Okay?

938
01:37:37,766 --> 01:37:39,225
Bye, John.

939
01:39:58,198 --> 01:40:01,701
WJMP time is 5:51
on this chilly Christmas Eve.

940
01:40:35,819 --> 01:40:37,570
Come on.

941
01:41:03,179 --> 01:41:07,725
- You know what's going on down there?
- Some problem with the traffic lights.

942
01:41:07,809 --> 01:41:09,269
Shit.

943
01:41:51,186 --> 01:41:54,814
Great tragedy on the River Ohio.

944
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:09,037
My God...

945
01:42:52,622 --> 01:42:55,166
Get off the bridge!
Everyone's gotta get off the bridge!

946
01:43:00,463 --> 01:43:03,007
Get off! Everyone get out
of your cars and get off!

947
01:43:04,676 --> 01:43:06,886
C.J., come on!

948
01:43:06,970 --> 01:43:09,264
You've gotta get off.
Turn the damn thing down.

949
01:43:09,305 --> 01:43:11,474
- What?
- You gotta get off the bridge now!

950
01:43:41,463 --> 01:43:44,507
- Get out! Get out!
- Let's go!

951
01:43:58,104 --> 01:44:01,316
Get off!
Get off the bridge!

952
01:44:03,443 --> 01:44:05,069
Oh, God!

953
01:44:13,119 --> 01:44:14,412
Go!

954
01:44:19,042 --> 01:44:21,336
Get out of the car!
Get off the bridge!

955
01:44:22,921 --> 01:44:24,672
Quick!

956
01:44:32,680 --> 01:44:34,015
Let's get out!

957
01:44:42,232 --> 01:44:44,067
Get out!

958
01:44:59,707 --> 01:45:00,750
Get out!

959
01:45:04,045 --> 01:45:06,506
Come on. Get out.

960
01:45:07,382 --> 01:45:09,801
All units, this is unit 64.

961
01:45:20,979 --> 01:45:22,814
Get out!

962
01:45:32,323 --> 01:45:33,992
Signal 33 on the Silver Bridge.

963
01:46:02,228 --> 01:46:04,147
Rose, do you copy?

964
01:46:07,108 --> 01:46:10,445
Signal 33 on the Silver Bridge...

965
01:48:42,305 --> 01:48:44,307
Wake up. Wake up.

966
01:48:51,523 --> 01:48:53,775
Here we go.

967
01:50:39,380 --> 01:50:41,299
You are here.

968
01:50:42,717 --> 01:50:45,053
I didn't know if I was dreaming or...

969
01:50:45,136 --> 01:50:47,263
I left DC right after you called.

970
01:50:49,641 --> 01:50:51,392
You did call me, right?

971
01:50:54,270 --> 01:50:55,480
Yeah.

972
01:50:56,689 --> 01:50:58,483
Yeah, I called.

973
01:51:03,905 --> 01:51:06,324
- How bad is it?
- It's bad.

974
01:51:07,951 --> 01:51:10,703
But I supposed
it could've been a lot worse.

975
01:51:13,248 --> 01:51:16,209
Are they done with the search?

976
01:51:16,292 --> 01:51:17,877
Thirty-six.

977
01:51:20,088 --> 01:51:22,549
Looks like about 36 people.

978
01:51:23,675 --> 01:51:24,759
Jesus.

979
01:51:35,478 --> 01:51:36,896
Thirty-six?

980
01:51:40,066 --> 01:51:41,484
Thirty-six?

981
01:51:49,284 --> 01:51:51,578
Wake up, number 37.
