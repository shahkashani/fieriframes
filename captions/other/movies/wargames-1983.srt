Look now, are we positive

that these men had no way
of knowing this was only a test?

We have to be on a plane
in less than an hour.

The president knows that I am fully
responsible for the men in my command.

I've ordered a revaluation of our

Wait a minute. Excuse me, general.

126
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:38,303
We can't ask these men
to go back to the president

You can't screen out human response.

129

Those men know what
it means to turn the keys

Now, it's as simple as that!

We ought to take
the men out of the loop.

had men in these silos

00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,847
General, we all know they're fine men.

141
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:27,769
But in a nuclear war, we can't have
our missiles lying in those silos

142
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:31,731
because they refuse to turn the
keys when the computers tell them to!

143

You mean, when
the president orders them to.

144
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:38,405
The president probably follows
the computer war plan. That's a fact!

145
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,950
Well, I imagine the joint chiefs
will have some input.

Well, the Soviets launch
a surprise attack, there's no time.

[Pat] Twenty-three minutes
from warning to impact.

Six minutes, if sub-launched.

150
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:57,090
Six minutes, that's barely enough time
for the president to make a decision.

151
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:00,135
Once he makes that decision,
the computer takes over.

152
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,389
I know that you've
got a plane waiting,

153
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,642
but if you give me five minutes,
I'll show you something.

154
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:18,695
These computers give us
access to the world.

155

Troop movements, Soviet missile tests,
shifting weather patterns.

156
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:26,369
It all flows into this room and then
into what we call the WOPR computer.

WOPR, what is that?

158

The War Operation Plan Response.

tell these gentlemen about the WOPR?

Well, the WOPR spends all its time

161
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,383
thinking about World War III.

162
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:44,679
Twenty-four hours a day,
365 days a year,

series of war games

using all available information
on the state of the world.

165

The WOPR has already
fought World War III as a game

time and time again.

167

responses to our responses,

168
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,490
to their responses and so on.

169

and looks for ways to improve the score.

170
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:12,040
But the point is that the key
decisions of every conceivable option

171
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,709
in a nuclear crisis
have been made by the WOPR.

172

You're saying that this

Hi! I'm Jennifer.

00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,874
- Is David here?
- How do you do?

484
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,625
Yeah. He's up in his room.

485
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,254
Thanks.

486
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,424
Have you ever heard
of the word "tumulus"?

487
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:20,051
Tumulus. No, I haven't. Sorry.

488
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:21,428
Neither have I.

489

[Knocking on door]

00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,141
Yeah.

491
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,102
Hi!

492
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,937
- Where have you been?
- What?

493
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,357
I haven't seen you in school.
Are you sick?

494
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:39,738
Oh... No. I was doing things.

495
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,573
You want to sit? How are you?

496
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,117
No, I'm gonna get some water, OK?

497
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:47,996
- What is all that stuff?
- It's nothing. I was just...

498
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:52,459
I tried to find out more about the guy
who designed those game programs...

499
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,461
...so I could get his secret password.

500
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:57,714
- Why?
- Why? Because...

501
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,800
What's so special about
playing games with some machine?

502
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:03,803
Oh, no. No, it's
not just some machine.

503
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,473
Here, look at this.

504
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:11,645
This is a tape I got from the library.
It's about this guy named Falken.

505
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,441
He was into games,
as well as computers.

506
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:21,780
He designed them so that they
could play checkers or poker, chess.

507
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,865
What's so great about that?

508
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,283
Oh, no.

509
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,160
What he did was great.

510
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:31,122
He designed this computer so that
it could learn from its own mistakes.

511
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,458
So they're better
the next time they played.

512
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,835
The system actually learned
how to learn.

513
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,463
It could teach itself.

514
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:43,510
If I could just get that damn
password, I could play the computer.

515
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,348
That's him. That's Falken.

516
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,268
That's him?

517
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:52,894
Wow.

518
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,480
He's amazing looking.

519
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:59,234
Can't you write to him or call him?

520
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,819
No, he's dead.

521
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,947
- He's dead?
- Yeah.

522
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,032
Here, look. Here's his obituary.

523
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:08,910
He wasn't very old.

524
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,705
[David] No, he was pretty old.
He was 41.

525
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,999
Oh, yeah? Oh, that's old.

526
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,086
[David] That's his little boy.

527
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,630
Oh, yeah?

528
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,383
This is really sad.

529
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,761
The child and his mother
died in a car crash.

530
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:27,887
Yeah, I know.

00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:30,181
"After the tragic loss
of his family,

532

- What was his name?

536
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,121
No, no. Falken's kid.

"Hello."

546
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:36,748
How can it ask you that?

547
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,292
It'll ask you what it's programmed to.

548
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,294
- Do you want to hear it talk?
- Yeah.

549
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,547
I'll ask how it feels.

[Man] Yes, sir.

641
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:28,182
Mr. President,
something's happening here.

642
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:29,600
I'll get back to you.

643

[Over PA] Reconfirmed.

644
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:32,645
What's happening?

645
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:35,148
[Joe] BMEWS and Cobra Dane now report

646
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:37,775
negative confirmation
on all inbound tracking.

647
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:42,989
Get on to SAC.
Tell them to hold steady.

648
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:48,703
Stop! It's a simulation!
It's an attack simulation running!

649
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:51,289
What's he yelling about?
I didn't order a simulation.

650
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:54,417
We're not being attacked!
It's a simulation!

651
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,085
Whoa, now! Hold it!

652
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,421
Don't run.
Somebody could get hurt.

653
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,840
I'm sorry.
We don't know how it happened

654
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:04,719
but someone on the outside fed
an attack simulation into the main.

655
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:08,306
Conley, take us off full alert.

656
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,892
Hold at DEFCON 4
till we find out exactly

657
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:13,352
what in the hell's happening here!

658
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:18,024
I didn't tell you to cut the line!
Did I tell you to? You cut the line!

659
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:20,568
They shut down before
we completed our trace.

660
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:24,030
We located the area
where the transmission originated.

661
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,115
- Where?
- Seattle, Washington.

662
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,784
[Paul] Shut it down.

663
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,411
Somebody's playing a game with us.

664
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:33,456
[Man on TV] The claims began at
a prophylactic recycling center...

665
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,417
- Hi, Dad!
- David!

666
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:39,337
- David, come in here.
- What did I do?

667
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:41,714
Plenty, mister, plenty.

668
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:46,969
You have just passed
all of your classes this semester.

669
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,680
- Congratulations, dear!
- Oh!

670
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:51,140
Show this to your dad.

671
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:54,852
Honey, David has something
to show you.

672
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,145
What's that?

673
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,523
- Here, Dad.
- Uh-oh.

674

[Laughs] This is good.

675
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:04,695
I'm so proud of you!

676

[Man on TV]... the U.S. Went on
a full-scale nuclear alert,

677
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,910

launched a surprise missile attack.

00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:42,525
Are you watching the news?

687
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:45,236
Jennifer. Yeah, I'm watching.

688
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:48,155
Is that us on TV?
Did we do that?

689
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:52,451
It could be. Oh, Jesus, Jennifer!
What am I gonna do?

690
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:54,954
They're gonna come get me.
I'm screwed!

691
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:56,372
I am screwed!

692
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:01,043
Wait, no! Sh!
Calm down, calm down.

693
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,963
If they were so smart,
they would've found you already.

694
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,214
Yeah.

695
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:09,760
All you have to do is throw the number
away and don't call it again.

696
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:11,971
That's all.

697
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,098
Maybe they didn't trace the call.

698
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:16,225
Right. Maybe they didn't.

699
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:20,813
I'm sure they didn't trace it.
All you have to do is act normal.

700
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:23,316
We'll both act normal
and it'll be fine.

701

- OK?
- OK.

God, this is so unbelievable.

Do you think maybe
I can tell Michelle?

705
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:34,035
No, Jennifer, don't call her!

706
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,914
I'm sorry. I won't.
I'll talk to you tomorrow, OK?

707
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,498
OK.

This large room is the command center

This is the commander's desk.
Col. Conley's in charge.

Why are we at DEFCON 4?

The Soviets saw our bombers scramble

it was just an exercise.

00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,720
George is with the FBI.
He brought the kid in.

776
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:30,224
It looks like we've got
a high school prank on our hands.

777
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:31,642
Paul, what happened?

778
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:34,144
The kid broke into
the war games subsystem

779
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:37,189
using a password left
by the original programmer.

- Password?
- Yes, sir.

781
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:40,693
None of my team knew it was there.

782
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,529
Kid claims he was looking
for a toy company.

That's great.
Anybody in here buy that one?

We can take out the password,

785

but it'd help to beef up
security around the WOPR.

There's no way a high school punk
can put a dime in a telephone

795
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:20,899
and break into our system.

796
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:23,235
He's got to be working
with somebody else.

797
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:24,987
He fits the profile perfectly.

798
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,323
He's intelligent,
but an underachiever,

799
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:31,076
alienated from his parents,
has few friends.

800
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:32,870
Classic case for Soviet recruitment.

801
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:35,664
What does this say
about the state of our country?

802
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,750
Have you gotten any insight

803
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:43,088
as to why a bright boy like this
would jeopardize the lives of millions?

804
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:45,299
Says he does this sort
of thing for fun.

805
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:48,886
Damn it, John, I want some answers
and I want them now!

806
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:50,888
Arthur.

807
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:55,893
- Let me talk to this prick.
- No more talk. Just do it!

808
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,646
I'll talk to the kid.

809
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:05,235
[Man] Who do they belong to,
do you know?

810
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:06,904
No idea.

811
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,198
- Good morning, sir.
- Where's the kid?

812
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:11,075
In the infirmary, sir.

813
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:14,161
[Keypad beeping]

814
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:24,421
Hello, David. John McKittrick.
I run the computer facility here.

815
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:28,509
- These aren't necessary, the handcuffs?
- No, sir.

816
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,678
David, uh...

817
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:36,058
We called your parents
and we told them everything's fine.

818
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,977
No charges have been filed.
[Sniffs] Yet.

819
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:43,857
But I think we are gonna need
a little time to sort things out here.

820
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:45,818
How much time?

821
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:49,238
That depends on how willing
you are to cooperate.

822
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,532
Oh. Of course.

823
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:54,159
I tell you what.

824
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:56,995
Sergeant, tell the O.D.
I'm taking David for a walk.

825
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:59,998
Let's go to my office.
We'll be more comfortable.

826
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:02,334
Go ahead.

827
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:09,633
[David] You worked with Stephen Falken,
didn't you?

828
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:12,344
[John] I started out as his assistant.
How'd you know?

829
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:15,347
[David] I read an article you co-wrote
on poker and nuclear war.

830
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:18,142
[John] Bluffing.
Yeah, that shook a few people up.

831
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:20,144
[David] He must have
been pretty amazing.

832
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:22,354
He's a brilliant man.
A little flaky.

833
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:27,067
He never understood
the practical uses of his work.

834
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:30,821
This machine over here
runs his game program.

835
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,364
Joshua.

836
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:35,701
[John] Come here a minute.

837
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:40,414
- See that sign up here? Up here?
- Yeah.

838
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:42,124
DEFCON?

839
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:45,085
That indicates
our current defense condition.

840
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:48,714
It should read DEFCON 5,
which means peace.

841
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:51,842
It's still on 4 because of
that little stunt you pulled.

842
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:56,013
Actually, if we hadn't caught it in
time it might have gone to DEFCON 1.

843
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:59,725
- Do you know what that means?
- No, what?

844
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,435
World War III.

845
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:03,729
Wow.

846
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:06,857
You say you broke into our system
just to play a game?

847
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:09,318
That's right. That's exactly right.

848
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:12,696
Mm-hm. [laughs]

849
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:16,241
When you saw it on the news,
you knew how serious it was.

850
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:17,701
Why'd you do it again?

851
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:20,370
I didn't.
I even threw the number away.

852
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:22,164
Yeah, they found it in the trash.

853
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,082
Joshua called me.

854
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:29,588
- Hey! Look at that. That's some setup.
- What'd you say?

855
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:31,673
This is some setup.

856
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:33,467
No, no, before that.

857
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:35,260
Joshua called me.

858
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:37,095
[Scoffs]

859
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:39,431
Machines don't call people.

860
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:42,142
Yours did.

861
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:48,690
Who are you going to Paris with?

862
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:53,529
Pari... Oh!
No, no, you don't understand.

863
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:56,406
Now, you had reservations
for two to Paris.

864
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:01,912
- Who are you working with?
- Nobody!

865
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:05,999
Why don't I believe you?

866
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,714
I shouldn't say any more
until I talk to a lawyer.

867
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,802
I think we better forget
about a lawyer

868
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:19,429
until I get a few answers
out of you myself.

869
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:23,725
[Phone rings]

870
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:31,191
[Continues ringing]

871
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:40,659
You gonna answer the phone?

872
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:48,500
Hello. Yeah. What?

873
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:51,295
All right, I'll be right down.

874
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,339
You stay here. Don't move.

875
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:07,644
What's going on?

876
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:11,315
There's been a serious penetration
into our WOPR execution order file.

877
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:13,859
- What's he saying?
- Let's have it in English.

878
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:18,363
I'll give it to you in English.
Somebody got into McKittrick's system

879
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:20,282
and stole our missile codes.

880
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,408
Is that right?

881
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:25,787
The system won't accept a launch code
unless we're at DEFCON 1.

882
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:28,165
I can change those codes in an hour.

883
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:29,708
Who did this?

884
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:32,669
The kid's gotta be working
with somebody.

885
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:37,382
I sure as hell don't want our bombers
on the ground if anything happens.

886
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:41,637
Take us to DEFCON 3 and get SAC
on the line. Where are you?

887
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,388
Sir.

888
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:46,725
Get me an update. I wanna know
what those bastards are up to.

889
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:47,851
Yes, sir.

890
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,895

[Joshua] Greetings, Professor Falken.

894
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:27,808
Hello. Are you still
playing the game?

895
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,686
Of course.

896
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,771
I should reach DEFCON 1

897
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:36,441
and launch my missiles in 28 hours.

898
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:41,405
Would you like to see
some projected kill ratios?

899
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:44,574
[David] Sixty-nine percent
of the housing destroyed.

900
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:47,244
Seventy-two million people dead?

901
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:54,042
Is this a game...

902
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:56,336
...or is it real?

903
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:59,673
- What's the difference?
- Oh, wow.

904
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:03,969
You are a hard man to reach.

905
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:06,471
Could not find you in Seattle

906
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:10,976
and no terminal is in operation
at your classified address.

907
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:20,235
What classified address?

908
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:26,408
DOD pension files
indicate current mailing ad...

909
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:30,829
...Dr. Robert Hume,

910

a.k.a. Stephen W. Falken.

911
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:40,839
5 Tall Cedar Road,
Goose Island, Oregon, 97...

912
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:43,842
Can I just talk to Mr. McKittrick?
I know what's... Ah!

913
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,177
Can I talk to McKittrick?

914
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:48,180
I'll be escorting you
to federal authorities in Denver

915
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:51,516
where you'll be under arrest
pending indictment for espionage.

916
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:54,603
No, wait a minute.
He's right over there.

917
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:57,439
Get that bastard out of the war room!

918
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,316
No! It's Joshua!

919
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:02,235
He's still playing the game!
He's gonna start a war!

920
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:05,363
Hold him where you had him before.
We'll be leaving soon.

921
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:08,033
[David] Call Falken! He'll tell you.
Please call him.

922
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:09,951
Please call him! Call him!

923
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:12,412
What the hell's he doing
in here anyway?

924
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:32,599
Some of the men say
you're quite a tennis player.

925
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:35,101
[Woman laughing]

926
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:47,299

927
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:49,718
and possibly PCP.

Depending on what information you want,
you press a button.

929
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:26,171
Well, let's say I wanted
to find out how to hit a backhand.

930
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:28,840
[Laughs] I don't think
I have the right program.

- Excuse me. What do you want?

It's a long ride to Denver.

[Keypad beeping]

934
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:43,396
Please, let me talk to Mr. McKittrick.

935
01:05:43,564 --> 01:05:46,149
You're not talking to anybody.
The FBI's coming soon.

936
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:49,027
- Do you have to take a leak?
- No.

- [Man] Oh, I'm sorry.

941

Stop it!

- You have pretty eyes.
- That's original.

943
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:30,527
- I'll get the elevator.
- Sign in?

944

- Yeah, get us all.

- [Woman] Yes.

a magnificent race of animals...

1107
01:21:47,027 --> 01:21:49,570
...who dominated the world
through age after age.

1108
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:53,949
They ran and they swam
and they fought and they flew,

1109
01:21:54,117 --> 01:21:55,409
until suddenly...

1110
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:57,161
...quite recently...

1111
01:21:57,329 --> 01:21:58,704
...they disappeared.

1112
01:21:58,872 --> 01:22:00,956
Nature just gave up

1113
01:22:01,124 --> 01:22:03,000
and started again.

1114
01:22:03,668 --> 01:22:05,169
We weren't even apes then.

1115
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:09,340
We were just these smart
little rodents hiding in the rocks.

1116
01:22:09,507 --> 01:22:11,091
And when we go...

1117
01:22:12,093 --> 01:22:14,261
...nature will start again...

1118
01:22:14,429 --> 01:22:16,305
...with the bees probably.

1119
01:22:17,974 --> 01:22:19,934
Nature knows when to give up.

1120
01:22:20,101 --> 01:22:21,894
I'm not giving up.

1121
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:26,190
If Joshua tricks them into launching
an attack, it'll be your fault.

1122
01:22:27,067 --> 01:22:28,233
My fault?

1123
01:22:28,401 --> 01:22:31,695
The whole point was
to practice nuclear war

1124
01:22:31,863 --> 01:22:33,238
without destroying ourselves.

1125
01:22:33,406 --> 01:22:37,201
To get the computers to learn
from mistakes we couldn't make.

1126
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:41,705
Except that I never could get Joshua
to learn the most important lesson.

1127
01:22:41,873 --> 01:22:43,457
What's that?

1128
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:47,211
Futility. That there's a time
when you should just give up.

1129
01:22:47,379 --> 01:22:49,088
What kind of lesson is that?

1130
01:22:49,255 --> 01:22:51,382
Did you ever play tic-tac-toe?

1131
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:54,385
Yeah. Of course.

1132
01:22:54,552 --> 01:22:56,512
- But you don't anymore.
- No.

1133
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:57,930
Why?

1134
01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:01,725
Because it's a boring game.
It's always a tie.

1135
01:23:01,893 --> 01:23:06,438
Exactly. There's no way to win.
The game itself is pointless.

1136
01:23:07,607 --> 01:23:11,819
But back at the war room, they believe
you can win a nuclear war...

1137
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:15,072
...that there can be
acceptable losses.

1138
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:17,533
So you gave up?

1139
01:23:18,284 --> 01:23:19,827
Decided to play dead?

1140
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:24,581
For security reasons,
they graciously arranged my death.

1141
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:28,419
Did you know that no land animal

1142
01:23:28,586 --> 01:23:31,880
with a body weight of
over 50 pounds survived that age?

1143
01:23:33,133 --> 01:23:36,093
Extinction is part
of the natural order.

1144
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:37,511
Bullshit!

1145
01:23:39,055 --> 01:23:42,224
If we're extinguished,
it's not natural. It's stupid.

1146
01:23:42,392 --> 01:23:45,227
It's all right. I've planned ahead.

1147
01:23:45,395 --> 01:23:49,189
We're just three miles
from a primary target.

1148
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:51,608
A millisecond of brilliant light...

1149
01:23:51,776 --> 01:23:53,569
...and we're vaporized.

1150
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:56,113
Much more fortunate than the millions

1151
01:23:56,281 --> 01:23:59,825
who'll wander sightless
through the smoldering aftermath.

1152
01:24:01,661 --> 01:24:04,455
We'll be spared
the horror of survival.

1153
01:24:05,123 --> 01:24:07,958
I'm only 17 years old.

1154
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,502
I'm not ready to die yet.

1155
01:24:10,670 --> 01:24:12,963
You won't make a simple phone call?

1156
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:18,469
If the real Joshua were still alive,
your Joshua...

1157
01:24:18,636 --> 01:24:19,803
...you'd do it.

1158
01:24:19,971 --> 01:24:23,098
We might gain a few years,
enough for you to have a son

1159
01:24:23,266 --> 01:24:25,017
and watch him die.

1160
01:24:26,811 --> 01:24:30,230
But humanity planning
its own destruction...

1161
01:24:31,608 --> 01:24:32,983
...that, a phone call won't stop.

1162
01:24:33,818 --> 01:24:35,152
This is unreal!

1163

You don't care about death
because you're already dead!

I know a lot about you.
I know you weren't always like this.

you cared about?

Mr. President, we've got 48 nuclear subs
closing on the United States,

1176
01:25:48,726 --> 01:25:53,063
and we've got 100,000 Soviet troops
massing in East Germany.

1177

We're monitoring their bombers
that are on alert.

Well, that's a load of shit!

No, no, sir. Not you.

Yes, sir. We'll be in touch
as soon as the information changes.

1181

There's rumors of a new Soviet bomber
with stealth capabilities.

1182
01:26:08,538 --> 01:26:12,249
It can project a false radar image
600 miles from the real aircraft.

How far do you think it is?

1188

No, it's two, three miles, at least.

[Man] All units confirm weapons
targeted and ready.

1263
01:33:31,939 --> 01:33:33,315
Awaiting launch codes.

1264
01:33:33,482 --> 01:33:35,275
We are in a launch mode.

1265
01:33:35,443 --> 01:33:37,944
Major Lem, lock out changes.

1266
01:33:38,112 --> 01:33:39,821
[Lem] Roger. Lock out enabled.

1267
01:33:50,207 --> 01:33:51,666
All right, I'll call you back.

1268
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:54,169
Here!

1269
01:34:01,802 --> 01:34:04,721
I don't know what you think
you could do here.

1270
01:34:04,889 --> 01:34:08,558
John! Good to see you.
I see the wife still picks your ties.

1271
01:34:08,726 --> 01:34:09,976
What has this kid been telling you?

1272
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:12,062
How far has it gone?

1273
01:34:12,813 --> 01:34:14,522
The president's ready to order
a counter-strike.

1274
01:34:14,690 --> 01:34:17,192
That's what we're recommending he do.

1275
01:34:19,695 --> 01:34:22,697
- It's a bluff. Call it off.
- It's not a bluff. It's real.

1276
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:25,742
Hello, General Beringer!
Stephen Falken.

1277
01:34:26,827 --> 01:34:29,454
[Beringer] Mr. Falken, you picked
a hell of a day for a visit.

1278
01:34:29,622 --> 01:34:34,334
General, what you see on these screens
up here is a fantasy...

1279
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:36,920
...a computer-enhanced hallucination.

1280
01:34:37,088 --> 01:34:40,215
Those blips are not real missiles.
They're phantoms.

1281
01:34:40,883 --> 01:34:44,594
Nothing indicates a simulation at all.
Everything's working perfectly.

1282
01:34:44,762 --> 01:34:47,555
- But does it make sense?
- Does what make sense?

1283
01:34:47,723 --> 01:34:48,556
That.

1284
01:34:48,724 --> 01:34:52,310
Look, I don't have time for
a conversation right now!

1285
01:34:52,478 --> 01:34:56,272
General, are you prepared to
destroy the enemy?

1286
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:59,317
- You bet!
- Do you think they know that?

1287
01:34:59,485 --> 01:35:01,194
I believe we've
made that clear enough.

1288
01:35:01,362 --> 01:35:03,238
Then don't.

1289
01:35:04,073 --> 01:35:06,241
Tell the president to ride out
the attack.

1290
01:35:07,034 --> 01:35:09,119
Sir? They need a decision.

1291
01:35:09,787 --> 01:35:14,416
Do you really believe that the enemy
would attack without provocation,

1292
01:35:14,583 --> 01:35:16,626
using so many missiles,
bombers and subs

1293
01:35:16,794 --> 01:35:20,130
so that we'd have no choice
but to totally annihilate them?

1294
01:35:20,297 --> 01:35:22,716
One minute and 30 seconds to impact.

1295
01:35:23,217 --> 01:35:27,011
General, you are listening
to a machine.

1296
01:35:27,179 --> 01:35:29,055
Do the world a favor
and don't act like one.

1297
01:35:30,975 --> 01:35:33,601
[Beeping]

1298
01:35:33,769 --> 01:35:37,105
[Woman over PA] One minute
and 20 seconds to impact.

1299
01:35:48,492 --> 01:35:50,535
Yes, Mr. President.

1300
01:35:50,703 --> 01:35:53,997
At this time, we cannot
positively confirm the inbounds.

1301
01:35:54,457 --> 01:35:56,875
We have reason to believe
they may not exist.

1302
01:35:57,752 --> 01:35:59,377
Yes, that's affirmative.

1303
01:36:00,963 --> 01:36:03,298
Yes, sir. I do too.

1304
01:36:03,466 --> 01:36:05,508
[Woman over PA] One minute to impact.

1305
01:36:07,219 --> 01:36:08,386
Who's first, how soon?

1306
01:36:08,554 --> 01:36:11,514
Initial impact points
in the 43rd bomb wing at Loring,

1307
01:36:11,682 --> 01:36:14,768
319th at Grand Forks
and Alaskan Air Command at Elmendorf.

1308
01:36:14,935 --> 01:36:16,644
[Woman over PA] 50 seconds to impact.

1309
01:36:16,812 --> 01:36:20,356
Get me the senior controller at those
stations. I want to talk to them.

1310
01:36:20,524 --> 01:36:22,358
All stations, this is Crystal Palace.

1311
01:36:22,526 --> 01:36:25,361
Stand by for a message from Brass Hat.
Acknowledge.

1312
01:36:25,529 --> 01:36:29,115
[Man] Elmendorf Air Force Base,
Operations. Lieutenant Colonel Bowers.

1313
01:36:29,283 --> 01:36:32,494
[Man 2] 319th Bomb Wing, Operations.
Colonel Chase.

1314
01:36:33,537 --> 01:36:35,079
[Man 3] This is Loring Air Force Base.

1315
01:36:35,247 --> 01:36:37,540
The senior controller
isn't here right now.

1316
01:36:37,708 --> 01:36:40,001
That's all right. Who are you?

1317
01:36:40,169 --> 01:36:42,879
Sir, this is Airman Dougherty, sir.

1318
01:36:44,048 --> 01:36:46,341
This is General Beringer at NORAD.

1319
01:36:46,509 --> 01:36:48,551
Our current situation is...

1320
01:36:49,553 --> 01:36:51,179
Men...

1321
01:36:51,347 --> 01:36:56,100
...we are currently tracking
about 2400 inbound Soviet warheads.

1322
01:36:56,268 --> 01:36:58,812
But at the moment,
we cannot confirm this.

1323
01:36:58,979 --> 01:37:01,564
I repeat, we cannot confirm this.

1324
01:37:01,732 --> 01:37:03,650
Thirty seconds to impact.

1325
01:37:04,401 --> 01:37:08,363
[Beringer] We're right there with you
guys. We've taken all the steps we can.

1326
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:11,825
Stand by to launch missiles
at my command.

1327
01:37:19,458 --> 01:37:22,126
Stay on this channel
as long as you can.

1328
01:37:22,586 --> 01:37:24,087
We'll be standing by.

1329
01:37:24,255 --> 01:37:26,965
[Woman over PA]
Twenty seconds to impact.

1330
01:37:36,267 --> 01:37:37,517
Ten...

1331
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:38,643
...nine...

1332
01:37:38,811 --> 01:37:40,562
...eight...

1333
01:37:40,729 --> 01:37:41,688
...seven...

1334
01:37:41,856 --> 01:37:43,231
...six...

1335
01:37:43,399 --> 01:37:45,108
...five...

1336
01:37:45,276 --> 01:37:46,276
...four...

1337
01:37:46,443 --> 01:37:47,735
...three...

1338
01:37:47,903 --> 01:37:49,112
...two...

1339
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:51,281
...one. Impact.

1340
01:37:51,448 --> 01:37:55,493
[Low beeping]

1341
01:38:03,794 --> 01:38:06,963
[Low rapid beeping]

1342
01:38:08,966 --> 01:38:15,388
This is Crystal Palace.
You still on?

1343
01:38:15,556 --> 01:38:17,098
Anyone there?

1344
01:38:18,976 --> 01:38:21,102
[Man] That's affirmative, sir.

1345
01:38:21,270 --> 01:38:23,187
[Man 2] Yeah! We're here!

1346
01:38:23,355 --> 01:38:26,399
- Christ! We're here!
- Boards are showing impact.

1347
01:38:28,193 --> 01:38:31,487
[Man 3] No, sir. No impact.
We're alive and well.

1348
01:38:31,655 --> 01:38:34,991
All right!

1349
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:38,328
[All cheering]

1350
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:41,998
All right!

1351
01:38:49,548 --> 01:38:51,132
Recall the bombers!

1352
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:54,385
Stand down the missiles!

1353
01:39:06,732 --> 01:39:08,608
[Rapid beeping]

1354
01:39:10,194 --> 01:39:13,863
[Beeping, buzzer sounds]

1355
01:39:25,084 --> 01:39:27,543
Joshua, what are you doing?

1356
01:39:30,923 --> 01:39:33,216
COC, I need Dr. McKittrick right away.

1357
01:39:33,717 --> 01:39:34,842
This is McKittrick.

1358
01:39:35,010 --> 01:39:38,638
We got a problem.
WOPR is not letting me log back on.

1359
01:39:38,806 --> 01:39:40,807
I can't get in to stand down
the missiles.

1360
01:39:40,975 --> 01:39:42,350
All right, stand by.

1361
01:39:47,314 --> 01:39:49,482
[Buzzer sounds]

1362
01:39:55,197 --> 01:39:56,656
Paul, this is McKittrick.

1363
01:39:56,824 --> 01:40:01,786
- The WOPR's not letting us back in.
- I know. No one can get back on.

1364
01:40:01,954 --> 01:40:06,457
We're trying everything. It's like
the password file has been wiped out.

1365
01:40:06,625 --> 01:40:09,419
Don't you think I would've tried that?

1366
01:40:13,257 --> 01:40:14,590
[David] What are those?

1367
01:40:15,384 --> 01:40:16,843
Those are launch codes.

1368
01:40:17,011 --> 01:40:18,553
What are they for?

1369
01:40:19,179 --> 01:40:22,765
Joshua's finding the right code
so he can launch the missiles himself.

1370
01:40:33,694 --> 01:40:34,986
[John] What's happening?

1371
01:40:35,154 --> 01:40:37,530
The random number generators
aren't even running.

1372
01:40:37,698 --> 01:40:39,532
- Got anything?
- I'm still looking.

1373
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:42,326
I got no idea.
It could be coming from anywhere.

1374
01:40:42,494 --> 01:40:44,120
[Laughing]

1375
01:40:44,288 --> 01:40:46,164
Sir, you better get on the headset.

1376
01:40:48,709 --> 01:40:49,792
Yeah?

1377
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:54,464
The machine's locked us out. It's
sending random numbers to the silos.

1378
01:40:54,631 --> 01:40:57,008
It's trying to hit the codes
to launch the missiles.

1379
01:40:57,176 --> 01:40:59,177
Just unplug the goddamn thing.

1380
01:40:59,344 --> 01:41:02,305
- Jesus Christ!
- That won't work, general.

1381
01:41:03,098 --> 01:41:06,434
It would interpret a shutdown
as the destruction of NORAD.

1382
01:41:06,602 --> 01:41:10,146
Computers in the silos would carry out
their last instructions. They'd launch.

1383
01:41:11,148 --> 01:41:12,607
Can't we disarm the missiles?

1384
01:41:12,775 --> 01:41:15,526
Over a thousand of them?
There's no time.

1385
01:41:15,694 --> 01:41:19,697
At this rate, it'll hit
the launch codes in 5.3 minutes.

1386
01:41:21,325 --> 01:41:22,408
Mr. McKittrick?

1387
01:41:23,285 --> 01:41:26,370
After very careful consideration,
I've come to the conclusion

1388
01:41:26,538 --> 01:41:29,082
that your new defense system sucks.

1389
01:41:30,834 --> 01:41:32,960
I don't have to take that,
you sack of shit!

1390
01:41:33,128 --> 01:41:36,589
Oh, I was hoping for something
a little better than that from you,

1391
01:41:36,757 --> 01:41:38,466
a man of your education.

1392
01:41:38,634 --> 01:41:40,259
[Man] It's the president.

1393
01:41:45,182 --> 01:41:48,101
Well, what are you gonna tell him?

1394
01:41:49,561 --> 01:41:52,438
That I'm ordering our bombers
back to fail-safe.

1395
01:41:52,856 --> 01:41:55,108
We might have to go through
this thing after all.

1396
01:41:58,362 --> 01:41:59,320
Yes, sir.

1397
01:41:59,655 --> 01:42:03,199
[Low humming, beeping]

1398
01:42:06,870 --> 01:42:10,039
He's got one. When he gets 10,
he'll launch the missiles.

1399
01:42:10,207 --> 01:42:11,624
Can't they stop it?

1400
01:42:11,792 --> 01:42:14,001
No, they can't.

1401
01:42:14,169 --> 01:42:15,962
[Beeping]

1402
01:42:16,130 --> 01:42:19,048
They've taken out my password!

1403
01:42:19,216 --> 01:42:20,341
What are we gonna do?

1404
01:42:20,509 --> 01:42:22,176
I don't know. Do you?

1405
01:42:22,553 --> 01:42:25,388
I told you not to start playing games
with that thing.

1406
01:42:29,768 --> 01:42:30,893
It's games.

1407
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:35,565
- Games!
- Try it.

1408
01:42:35,732 --> 01:42:37,191
John, let's feed it a tapeworm.

1409
01:42:37,359 --> 01:42:40,403
- It might smash the system.
- The kid get in by the back door?

1410
01:42:40,571 --> 01:42:42,697
- We took it out.
- Can we invade the deep logic?

1411
01:42:42,865 --> 01:42:44,448
We keep hitting a firewall.

1412
01:42:44,616 --> 01:42:46,200
If it wants to play a game, then play.

1413
01:42:46,368 --> 01:42:48,536
- Have it list games.
- Stephen, for chrissake!

1414
01:42:48,704 --> 01:42:50,288
[Jennifer] Let him!
He's played it before.

1415
01:42:50,455 --> 01:42:52,331
- He can't do any worse.
- [Pat] Two numbers.

1416
01:42:52,499 --> 01:42:55,835
I'd piss on a spark plug
if I thought it'd do any good.

1417
01:42:56,003 --> 01:42:57,461
Let the boy in there.

1418
01:42:57,629 --> 01:42:58,713
List games.

1419
01:43:04,970 --> 01:43:06,137
"Chess."

1420
01:43:09,433 --> 01:43:11,142
[Buzzer sounds]

1421
01:43:13,604 --> 01:43:15,271
Three numbers locked in.

1422
01:43:15,439 --> 01:43:16,689
"Poker."

1423
01:43:18,275 --> 01:43:19,066
[Buzzer sounds]

1424
01:43:19,234 --> 01:43:22,111
[Man] The security system's not gonna
let anything through.

1425
01:43:25,616 --> 01:43:27,325
"Global thermonuclear war."

1426
01:43:31,997 --> 01:43:33,581
[Beeping]

1427
01:43:36,335 --> 01:43:37,543
[Pat] Four numbers.

1428
01:43:38,128 --> 01:43:39,795
[Buzzer sounds]

1429
01:43:39,963 --> 01:43:42,006
Stephen, for chrissake, do something.

1430
01:43:42,174 --> 01:43:44,800
- Come on, kid. Let's go.
- No. Try again.

1431
01:43:48,263 --> 01:43:50,181
- Put the list back up.
- We tried that.

1432
01:43:50,349 --> 01:43:52,183
- Put it up!
- Yes, put it up.

1433
01:44:00,484 --> 01:44:03,027
- It's not on the list!
- What's not on the list?

1434
01:44:03,195 --> 01:44:05,071
It's gotta be in there.

1435
01:44:08,116 --> 01:44:10,993
"Tic-tac-toe."

1436
01:44:17,668 --> 01:44:18,668
You're in.

1437
01:44:19,211 --> 01:44:21,462
- [Man] Order to disarm the missiles.
- No. No.

1438
01:44:24,675 --> 01:44:26,175
[Buzzer sounds]

1439
01:44:31,265 --> 01:44:33,349
Five numbers. It's got half the code.

1440
01:44:35,394 --> 01:44:36,602
One.

1441
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:40,523
- Put X in the center.
- I know.

1442
01:44:51,827 --> 01:44:53,828
- [Pat] Six up.
- [Man] You can't win that game.

1443
01:44:53,996 --> 01:44:57,039
I know that. It doesn't.
It hasn't learned.

1444
01:44:57,207 --> 01:44:59,292
Can you make it play itself?

1445
01:45:00,252 --> 01:45:01,877
Yes. Number of players: Zero.

1446
01:45:10,721 --> 01:45:14,390
[Beeping]

1447
01:45:23,150 --> 01:45:24,108
Seven!

1448
01:45:24,276 --> 01:45:26,944
Come on. Learn, goddamn it!

1449
01:45:28,530 --> 01:45:31,907
[Rapid beeping]

1450
01:45:39,791 --> 01:45:40,833
Eight!

1451
01:45:41,001 --> 01:45:42,501
[Paul] Must be caught in a loop.

1452
01:45:42,669 --> 01:45:45,421
It's drawing more power
from the rest of the system.

1453
01:45:46,965 --> 01:45:48,341
[Pat] Nine numbers!

1454
01:45:51,553 --> 01:45:52,345
[Rapid beeping]

1455
01:45:52,512 --> 01:45:55,431
Ten! It's got the code.
It'll launch!

1456
01:46:09,613 --> 01:46:11,072
- [Explosion]
- [Screams]

1457
01:46:14,159 --> 01:46:16,786
[Man] Colonel Conley, call SAC
for a launch status report.

1458
01:46:19,331 --> 01:46:21,332
- Get me the president.
- Yes, sir.

1459
01:46:30,634 --> 01:46:48,484
[Low rumbling]

1460
01:46:54,783 --> 01:46:55,741
How you doing?

1461
01:46:55,909 --> 01:46:59,328
Our land lines are dead. I'm trying
to break through on satellites.

1462
01:47:12,759 --> 01:47:16,178
[Radio feedback]

1463
01:47:20,183 --> 01:47:23,060
[Overlapping indistinct chatter]

1464
01:47:24,604 --> 01:47:26,021
What's it doing?

1465
01:47:26,189 --> 01:47:27,356
It's learning.

1466
01:48:14,988 --> 01:48:17,781
[Joshua] Greetings, Professor Falken.

1467
01:48:26,917 --> 01:48:27,917
"Hello...

1468
01:48:28,460 --> 01:48:29,585
...Joshua."

1469
01:48:30,712 --> 01:48:31,962
Strange game.

1470
01:48:32,130 --> 01:48:36,091
The only winning move
is not to play.

1471
01:48:43,767 --> 01:48:48,020
How about a nice game of chess?

1472
01:48:50,148 --> 01:48:54,151
[Indistinct cheering]

1473
01:49:23,598 --> 01:49:24,848
Colonel Conley...

1474
01:49:25,684 --> 01:49:28,435
...take us to DEFCON 5.
- Yes, sir.
