00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,223
[Eliot] You know,
there's a lot of virtues

162
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,837
in taking a bus to work,
you know.

163
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,011
Hi, fellas.
Thanks a lot and merry Christmas.

164
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:51,800
- Bobby Lou Caluda.
- The bath towel.

165
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:52,967
[shushing]

166
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,434
Eliot Loudermilk's leaving early today.

167
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:58,769
Move. Get out of here.

168
00:09:58,932 --> 00:09:59,979
Done!

169
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,485
Four minutes and 40 seconds.

170
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,396
Glenn Glenn Whitacre?

171
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,906
What was the last rating on <i>Police Zoo?</i>

172
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,739
5.2 Nielsen, <i>7</i> in share and a TVQ of 3.

173
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:10,652
Towel!

174
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,162
Your brother?

175
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,833
- Towel.
- Your only brother.

176
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:17,833
[intercom buzzing]

177
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,494
Oh, God, Grace. Give it to me.

178
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,372
Get that.

179
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:23,882
Towel, towel.

180
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,917
- Mr. Cross' office.
- Towel. VHS.

181
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,507
- Ah, thank you.
- Most of these are towels.

182
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,887
Be wrong once, OK?

183
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,174
Mr. Rhinelander's on his way down.

184
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:39,264
Booze.

185
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,398
[burps] Pardon me.

186
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,647
[burps] Excuse me.

187
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,147
Grace.

188
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,741
Put yourself down for a towel, too.

189
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,152
What about my bonus?

190
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,705
- Towel and a face cloth.
- Ah, shit!

191
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,699
- Frank.
- Hey, Pres.

192
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,834
- What a surprise.
- Grace.

193
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,666
[Frank] You look great.
You've been working out.

194
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,330
Why didn't you tell me, Grace?

195
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,215
Preston, just looking at some
of this ink we're getting on Scrooge.

196
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,001
Mary Lou Retton as Tiny Tim.

197
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,253
Can you believe
the first director didn't want her?

198
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,421
- No.
- Well, he does now.

199
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:12,760
He go bye-bye.

200
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,970
Hey, did you catch her buy
on Tiny Tim?

201
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,261
She doesn't just throw away
the crutches and walk.

202
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:18,929
She throws away the crutches,

203
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:22,190
vaults over a lamppost,
double somersault,

204
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,609
back into one of these things.

205
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,064
- Frank.
- Killer.

206
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,228
Yes, Preston?

207
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,820
Have you any idea how many cats
there are in this country?

208
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,369
No.

209
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,406
I don't have those... No.

210
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:38,572
Twenty-seven million.

211
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,215
- [whistles]
- Do you know how many dogs?

212
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,290
- In America?
- Forty-eight million.

213
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:47,048
- Wow.
- We spend $4 billion on pet food alone.

214
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,584
Four'?

215
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,628
Now, I have here a study
from Hampstead University

216
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:55,674
which shows us that cats and dogs
are beginning to watch television.

217
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,889
Now, if these scientists are right,

218
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,933
we should start programming right now.

219
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,224
Within 20 years,
they could become steady viewers.

220
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,734
Programming for cats?

221
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,571
Walk with me, Frank.

222
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,031
[whispering] Call the police.

223
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,950
Now, I'm not saying,
build a whole show around animals.

224
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,244
- Oh, no.
- All I'm suggesting

225
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,505
is that we occasionally throw in
a little pet appeal.

226
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,374
Some birds, a squirrel.

227
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,338
- Mice.
- Mice. Exactly.

228
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,966
Remember Kojak and the lollipops?

229
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:37,841
What about a cop that dangles string?
That's his gimmick.

230
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,385
Lots of quick, random action.

231
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,105
Frank, wasn't there
a dormouse in Scrooge?

232
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:47,859
No. But now that you say it,
I always felt that it needed a dormouse.

233
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,019
- Dormice. Better.
- Bingo.

234
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,274
Frank, this show is the jewel
in the IBC crown.

235
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,154
Everything is riding on it.

236
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,662
Don't worry, Preston. I'm overseeing
every aspect of production.

237
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:00,993
We'll own Christmas.

238
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,283
That's what I wanted to hear.

239
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,538
- Lunch tomorrow? Chez Jay'?
- Right.

240
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:08,876
- Up, Sid.
- Yes, sir.

241
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,291
- Study this.
- Thank you.

242
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:12,921
Oh, God.

243
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,338
If only I could fire
that poor son of a bitch.

244
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,974
Hey, Frank!
Ah, hold that door, will you, pops?

245
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,680
Wait for me a minute, will you?
You don't mind?

246
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:24,221
Hey, it's Brice Cummings.
We met at Spago.

247
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,513
Have you seen Preston?

248
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,728
Uh, Preston just went back upstairs.

249
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,860
I just dropped by to say hello.
I went to school with the big guy's son.

250
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,942
You give me a call
when you hit the Coast, OK?

251
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:36,074
<i>Let's go. You know, so, anyway.
So, Close“ said...</i>

252
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,957
[Frank] Come here. Slam this door. Hard.

253
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,546
Grace, I need a full report
on a guy named Brice Cummings.

254
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,384
He's an LA slimeball.

255
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,921
OK. Urn, you're due
at Helmsley Palace at 7:00.

256
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,556
- And I'm gonna leave. I'm gonna take...
- No, you're not.

257
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,262
You're staying here with me.
We're working late.

258
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:03,927
I have to take my son to the doctor.

259
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,596
Grace, when I work late, you work late.

260
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,561
But I made the appointment
two months ago.

261
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:10,270
I care!

262
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:13,528
We're indivisible. If I'm
working late, you gotta work late!

263
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,155
If you can't work late,
I can't work late!

264
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:20,239
If I can't work late, I can't work late!

265
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,950
Oh, your brother's waiting inside.

266
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:31,212
Oh, and I didn't tell him
about his great Christmas towel.

267
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:38,844
Francis.

268
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,299
A little bit rough on her out there,
weren't you?

269
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,473
You know what they say about
treating people badly on the way up?

270
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:46,852
Yep.

271
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,434
You get to treat them badly
on the way down, too.

272
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,771
It's great.
You get two chances to rough them up.

273
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,730
[music playing]

274
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,615
- [man] Yeah.
- [woman] Yeah.

275
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,995
Why don't the cops
do something about this?

276
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,280
Excuse me, please.

277
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,621
Great. Rip off the hicks, why don't you?
Did you learn this song yesterday'?

278
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:10,831
Sweet.

279
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,166
Frank, you don't like Christmas much,
do you?

280
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,081
Like it? I love it.

281
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,501
It's cold. The people stay home
and watch television.

282
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,214
Ad revenues go up 30%.

283
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:22,051
All these idiots are gonna be home
watching the boob tube for me tonight.

284
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,307
I am the biggest fan
that Christmas ever had.

285
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,469
So, uh, any chance of you maybe
making Christmas dinner this year?

286
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,636
None.

287
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,680
- Come on. Why not?
- Don't start, James.

288
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,396
Come on, the whole family will be there.
It'll be fun.

289
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:36,152
Look, you can have your concerned
and wonderful dinner

290
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,482
with all your cool friends

291
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,398
and the real popcorn and the tree
and cranberries and everything,

292
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:43,114
send Christmas cards to each other
on recycled paper.

293
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,653
It's a crock, James.

294
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,196
It's for kids.

295
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,490
You know, I like seeing you.

296
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,533
I like being with you.

297
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,211
I want you to have a happy New Year.

298
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,542
[Woman] Taxi!

299
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,131
Merry Christmas.

300
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,667
Taxi!

301
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,258
Excuse me, ma'am.
I think you dropped something there.

302
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,803
Hey, that's my cab.

303
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,093
Oh, sir, please. I...

304
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,602
Leona Helmsley's
and step on it, will you?

305
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,480
You son of a bitch,
you should burn in hell!

306
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,731
Bye-bye, grandma. Bye-bye.

307
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:19,484
[Frank] I got into broadcasting
because I like to give.

308
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:24,193
Sometimes I found myself hurting
from giving too much,

309
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,903
and I'd say, "Stop it."

310
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,499
I'm always gonna cherish this.

311
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,243
And all of you.

312
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,931
I should...
I should have went in there.

313
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,968
I should... I should have said,
"Frank Cross, you gotta..."

314
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,893
You stinking... You big dog, you...

315
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,060
[bottle crashing]

316
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,236
- [driver] $4.85.
- Here's $5.

317
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,132
- Mr. Cross.
- Mr. Cross.

[Grace] Wasn't he a medical genius?

319
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:40,978
Calvin, I think "doctor"
is a Latin word for "thief."

320
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:45,778
$200 I don't have
to tell me that you don't speak.

321
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,610
I'm your mother.
I know you don't speak...

We'll show them, honey.

325
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,667
You're gonna surprise a lot of people.

326
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:57,998
Yes, you are.

327
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,580
You start talking,

328
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,919
then go to law school
and sue his butt off.

329
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,174
OK.

330
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,006
[knock on door]

331
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,265
Come!

00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,844
[knock on door]

00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,308
Who's there?

[rumbling]

This office is closed!

That was a good one.

How are you, kid? You're...

343

Uh, will you excuse me?
I'll make myself a little drink.

I don't mind you hitting me, Frank,
but take it easy on the Bacardi.

Oh.

God.

00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,070
To old times, my friend.

Oh, my God. It's...

351
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,883
Lew Hayward.
Your old boss and your best friend.

352
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,509
But you're...

353
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,682
...dead.
- Seven years.

[exclaiming]

Has it been that long? Jeez, I...

356
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,932
I mean, to look at you, I wouldn't
have guessed more than three, tops.

357
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:25,600
Oh, Frank.

358
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,894
Frank, you are in trouble.

359
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,028
- Big trouble.
- All right.

360
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,189
Let's just say, for argument's sake,

361
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,108
that you're right,
that I am in big trouble.

362
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:35,527
What exactly would that mean?

363
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:38,412
Look at me. Look at your future.

364
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,744
Now, if you don't change your ways,

365
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:44,331
you're gonna wind up doomed,
just as I am.

366
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,670
[Lew coughing]

367
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:50,083
One minute I'm on the 14th hole
at Winged Foot,

368
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,671
lining up a putt.

369
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:55,513
A heart attack later, I'm a worm feast.

370
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,469
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

371
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,008
You're not a worm feast.

372
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:02,645
You're a hallucination
brought on by alcohol!

373
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,306
Russian vodka poisoned by Chernobyl!

374
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,688
I've been under
a lot of pressure lately.

375
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,773
- I've been putting on a big...
- Silence!

376

Ouch.

377
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,814
- I had it all.
- Oh.

378
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,858
I was a captain of industry,

379
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,991
feared by men, adored by women.

380
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:24,580
Adored! Let's be honest, Lew.
You paid for the women.

381
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:28,667
I'm warning you, Frank.
Don't waste your life as I did mine.

382
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,878
Waste? How can you say that.
You're a legend in this business.

383
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,761
You are the man
who invented the miniseries.

384
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,508
Mankind should have been my business.

385
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:40,342
Charity, mercy, kindness,
that should have been my business.

386
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:42,636
Don't wait. Get yourself involved.

387
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,642
Now it's too late for me,
but it's not for you.

388
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:46,105
You can be saved.

389
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:50,518
You are going to be visited
by three ghosts.

390
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,483
- Ooh, three ghosts.
- Three ghosts, Frank.

391
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:56,741
Expect the first one tomorrow at noon.

392
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,443
God, tomorrow's bad for me, Lew.

393
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,329
As a matter of fact, the whole rest
of the week is a washout. Ouch.

394
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,582
Well, maybe we could have drinks,
say, Thursday.

395
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,500
You, me, the ghost.
Trader Vic's around 4:00?

396
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,624
This is no joke, Frank.
This is your last chance!

397
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:12,757
All right.
I could squeeze you in for a breakfast.

Well, specifically,
you can see her nipples.

477
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:19,787
Well, Charles Dickens would have
wanted to see her nipples then.

478
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:20,579
Ah.

479
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,965
You can hard...
You can hardly see them nipples.

480
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,592
See? And these guys are really looking.

481
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:27,545
You can go shake a tail feather.
Thanks.

482
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,759
And thank you. You can just go.

Thanks, boys. Get the nurse.

Get the nurse. Get the nurse!

486
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,349
Make sure her nipples are covered up,
will you?

Hi.

I'm sorry to just...

491
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,546
Well, I didn't get your message
until this morning.

492
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,802
And I-.. I tried to call
but they said that you weren't..-...

493
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:09,962
...you weren't in yet.

494
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:14,100
And then I tried to call back and they
said that you were busy, so I just...

495
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,015
God, you look different.

496
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,266
Well, it's been a while.

497
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:21,936
It's your hair.

498
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,652
I've never seen it so short.
It makes you look sort of

499

500
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,027
Yo, Frank. Frank!

501
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,534
I mean, Mr. Cross. Check this out, man.

502
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:35,617
Girls are tough. It's on the money.
Check it. Come on.

- Here we go, ladies.

No.

All right. That works. See?

Little booty here for you.

See? Show me a nipple.

Is she gonna be all right?

Oh, yeah. She's a real pro.

A ghost?

You mean the phone call last night?

522
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:20,666
I came across your number
and I just had to call you immediately.

I know you, Lumpy. I know that voice.
That was the frightened Lumpy I heard.

Excuse me, Lumpy.

I'm sorry.
I'm new here and I got a problem.

I'll bet. What?

528
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:35,176
Well, my problem is this little fella.

Oh.

I can't get the antlers glued
onto this little guy.

- Staples?

Don't you dare.

534
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:47,609
If you staple that little mouse,
I'll call the Humane Society.

535
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:48,769
I'm not kidding.

536
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:50,734
I wouldn't do anything in the world
to hurt this little fella.

Hey, Marlin Perkins. The road.

You little worm.

Who are you? How'd you get in here?

549
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,683
Well, maybe you'll answer some
questions downtown, huh, my friend?

550

What the hell is going on?

- All right, you beat him.

- Does he work here?
- No, he does not.

553

I thought it would be fun for him
to see a live television show.

You see anybody having fun here?

Well...

Frank, what did happen last night?

00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:34,021
Claire, it was something that I ate.

575
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:37,010
It was probably a bad clam
or something. We don't know yet.

576
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:42,299
Well, if it happens again...

577

...give me a call here.
I'm... I'm hardly ever home.

I'm definitely gonna call
because I'm a seafood nut.

579
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,694
And, you know, to not eat clams is...

a reaction to the woman's death.

Well, we slapped her in the face
and got her attention.

587
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:12,688
It was probably something she ate.

probably something that she ate.

So, how's everything going, Frank?

Couldn't be better, Preston.

Oh, Mr. Rhinelander, hello. Mr. Cross.

May I get you gentlemen
something from the bar?

Yes, everything's fine.

painting the Wall for us.

Then we're gonna
shoot on out to Africa

where the Holy Father is gonna
bless the entire Zulu nation.

We think it's the largest baptism
of all time.

That's just the point, Frank.

616

I'm afraid you might be
spreading yourself a little thin.

617

So I've taken the liberty
of hiring somebody to work with you.

Oh, look at this.

off of your shoulders.

A lot of men in your position

00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,021
Yeah, it is Christmas.

947
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,353
It's a time to be
a little bit less selfish, you know.

948
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:21,986
Maybe if you could put my needs
and the needs of the Frisbee Show

949
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:23,646
ahead of your own needs...

950
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:26,486
I mean, I have been fighting
for the integrity of this show.

951
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:27,821
This is the opportunity of a lifetime.

952
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:30,406
- I'm sorry.
- [man] Sixty seconds!

953
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:34,533
I guess I didn't realize
how important it is to you.

954
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:38,456
Well, I'm willing to forgive you
once in a while. I am.

955
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:40,913
Frank, look.

956
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:45,217
Maybe we should separate for a while.

957
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,178
- [Estelle] Excuse me.
- Estelle?

958
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:49,384
- Yeah?
- When is that limo leaving?

959
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:52,300
Oh, right after the show.
You know how he is.

960
00:50:53,092 --> 00:50:56,392
For a while and... see how it goes.

961
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:58,852
I mean, I... I know you've been
under a lot of pressure.

962
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:02,643
[sighing]
Oh, it's been rough.

963
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:13,954
All right.
I'll try to come over later if I can.

964
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,373

<i>You left Claire for Frisbee the Dog?</i>

974
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:50,616
Frank, let me sum this up for you.

975
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:54,199
You don't know who you are,
you don't know what you want,

976
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:57,365
and you don't know
what the hell is going on.

977
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,708
I've made a few mistakes.

978
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,789
I gotta live with that.

979
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:05,297
But I know who I am.

980
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,712
I know what I want.

981
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:08,955
And I know what's going on.

982

Hold on! Hello, taxi!

988
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:32,316
I have seen your nobler aspirations
fall off one by one

989
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:35,703
till the master passion, greed,
engrosses you.

[sobbing]
Farewell, Ebenezer.

991
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:43,244
May you be happy
with the path that you have chosen.

992
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:46,960
Well, I am happy with the path
that I've chosen, you little bitch!

993
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,715
In fact, I couldn't be happier!

994

What are you? Crazy'?

- [bell ringing]
- Yeah, Buddy, I'm crazy!

996
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,214
Crazy like a fox!

997
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:58,100
Crazy enough
to see through your little tricks.

998
00:52:58,384 --> 00:53:00,603
I'm back. I can see now.

999
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:03,014
No one could have been
that simple and good,

1000
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:07,310
and sweet, and kind, and decent,
yet caring, wonderful.

Not on this planet! No, baby.

1002
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:12,982
Not unless they had something to hide,
some sort of trick up their sleeve.

1003
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,946
You wouldn't try to trick me, would you?

1004
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:18,454
Don't try to trick me today
because I'm back, Jack!

1005
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:22,082
Maybe we'll just check things out
over there at Operation Reach Out.

1006
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:23,409
Pick a side, grandma.

Well, just for the record, you left me.

1013
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:44,142
You had to go somewhere and get
your head together or something.

1014
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:47,103
Well, baby, my head is just fine.
Check it out!

It's right here where it belongs!

What's the point?
It's lonely at the top?

1017
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,945
It's not lonely at the top.

1018
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:59,453
Oh, maybe around my birthday
and at sunset.

1019
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:00,988
And there have been
a couple of weekends

That's my life! I've chosen it!

1023

At least I work someplace that you can
find when you're looking for it!

OK, here we are now.

I have been thinking a lot
about the past,

1068
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:07,532

"Well, I've made a lot of decisions,

Yeah, yeah, I'm talking about regret.
Yeah!

You know, the one good thing about

You can always change if you want to.

I mean, it's just some fuses.

You go down to the hardware store
and you buy fuses.

- What about the turkeys?
- And the turkeys are at the A&P?

1091
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:05,681
- Look it up in the phone book.
- No, no, no.

1092
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:08,555
It's under "A" and if you
can't find it there, it's under "P."

[groans]

1250
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:37,591
I'll check my records.
She may be due for a raise.

1251
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:39,922
- May be?
- Probably!

1252
01:04:40,085 --> 01:04:41,462
- Probably'?
- Yeah, yeah.

1253
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:43,221
May be, probably, perhaps?

1254
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,098
I'm almost positive.

1255
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:47,336
- Get off your brother!
- Get off me. Leave me alone.

1256
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:49,603
This boy is mine!

Cut it out! Stop it! Stop it!

[all laughing]

1261
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:01,155
Don't forget to watch the show.
I'm taking Calvin with me, Mama.

- Hey, come on, Frank.

01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,078
Next stop's downtown!

- [dog barking]

1269
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:17,963
A little jump, huh?

1270
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:19,837
Hi, Cujo.

1271
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:21,717
[glass shattering]

1272
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:23,219
Bark! Bark!

1273
01:05:23,962 --> 01:05:25,339
Who is here?

1274
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:29,468
- What are you barking at out there?
- Go, go.

1275
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:31,874
You are really crazy.
There's nothing there. Now come on.

1276

- Come on.

All right, let's get down to business.

1278
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:36,891
I want you to stay here
and I want you to...

[exclaims]
Oh, my, what a merry feast.

1280
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:44,574
- It looks like a beer commercial.
- Let's go in.

1281
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:45,858
[people chattering]

1282

Don't vex me, Frank,

or I'll fix your mouth
so it won't hold soap!

1284
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:55,452
A Christmas party.
I'm so glad I wore my pretty dress.

"On The Addams <i>Family,</i> what
musical instrument did Lurch play?"

what musical instrument did Lurch play'?

- [James] Piano.
- I may be invisible but I'm not deaf!

1288

- OK, OK, we're gonna say piano.
- It was the piano.

1289
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:11,385
- Harpsichord.
- Harpsichord.

1290
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:13,178
A harpsichord, James, you dope.

1291
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:15,813
- Oh, you knew that.
- Everybody knows that.

1292
01:06:16,556 --> 01:06:17,996
- [all muttering]
- It's their house.

1293
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:20,269
We better give it to them or else
they'll have us hanging Sheetrock.

1294
01:06:20,435 --> 01:06:23,355
You shouldn't have given that to them.
I wouldn't have given that to them.

1295
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:24,818
- Give it to them.
- James.

1296
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:26,983
You forgot to open
your brother's present.

1297
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:29,573
That doesn't look like a towel.

1298
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:31,033
What did he get for last year?

1299
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:33,039
- I don't remember.
- I remember.

1300
01:06:33,198 --> 01:06:34,575
A shower curtain!

1301
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:37,540
It was a beautiful shower curtain.
It was gray with these IBC logos.

1302
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:39,875
It had little... Yeah!

1303
01:06:40,038 --> 01:06:42,438
- You don't have one.
- Well, what did you get him this year?

1304
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:43,841
[James] Oh, nothing.

1305
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,547
[yelling]

1306
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:47,758
I made this picture frame.

1307
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:50,552
He made it with his own little hands.

1308
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:52,641
[woman] How sweet.

1309
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,268
I know something you don't know.

1310

I know something you don't know.
I know something you don't know.

Shut up!

[James] Jackpot.

1313
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:04,438
It's your basic
top-of-the-line Pioneer VCR.

1314
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:05,605
[an] Wow.

1315
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:07,820
- I think he made a mistake.
- This ought to work.

1316
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:09,575
I didn't get the gifts mixed up.

1317
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:12,954
My ex-secretary got the gifts mixed up.

1318
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:15,206
You invite him
to Christmas dinner every year

1319
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:17,493
and every year, he's too busy to come.

1320
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:19,536
And when are you gonna learn?

1321
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:21,913
Never. He's... he's my brother.

1322
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:24,299
[James] A toast...

1323
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:27,301
...to my brother Frank.

1324
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:29,713
- I wish he was here.
- Were, goofy.

1325
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:31,798
You're too good.

1326
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:34,184
- [woman] To Frank.
- [James] To Frank. Cheers!

1327
01:07:34,342 --> 01:07:36,015
The richest man you know.

1328
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:37,975
Keep the VCR.

1329
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:39,605
What the hell.

1330
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:41,687
It's only money.

1331
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:46,275
- It's a write-off. It's tax-deductible.
- I understand, Frank.

1332
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:48,239
- [all chattering]

- It's a fish.

Let's go now, Frank.

1340

Leave me alone. I know this one.

1341

Everybody knows this one. Let's go now!

Oh, yeah?
Does everybody know this one here?

Oh, Frank, we're fighting again.
Let's not fight anymore!

01:08:16,676 --> 01:08:19,600
Oh, look, Frank. What is it?

1345
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:20,888
[woman 1] I can't find the card.

1346
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:23,023
It's a toaster!

Why didn't you stay with Claire?
