And doesn't this remind you
of when you were in the boat?

00:05:47,442 --> 00:05:49,375
And then later that night,

9
00:05:49,476 --> 00:05:53,503
you were lying, looking
up at the ceiling,

10
00:05:53,614 --> 00:05:56,582
and the water
in your head...

11
00:05:56,683 --> 00:05:59,481
was not dissimilar
from the landscape,

12
00:05:59,585 --> 00:06:03,179

"Why is it that the landscape...

is moving,

14
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,392

is still?"

00:28:44,194 --> 00:28:46,890
Here's white man's metal
next to your heart.

183
00:28:46,997 --> 00:28:50,091
I tried to cut it out,
but it's too deep inside.

184
00:28:53,536 --> 00:28:55,595
A knife would cut
your heart instead...

185
00:28:55,705 --> 00:28:57,969
and release the spirit
from within.

186
00:29:00,008 --> 00:29:02,306
Stupid fucking white man.
[Chuckles]

187
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,424
Do you have any tobacco?

188
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:26,054
I don't smoke.

[Dialect Continues]

191
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,425
Hey, Wilson,
got any extra tobacco?

192
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:07,795
Well, of course you wouldn't have
any extra tobacco. How 'bout you?

193
00:30:10,803 --> 00:30:13,600
Shit. You ain't even
old enough to smoke.

194
00:30:23,147 --> 00:30:26,138

Ahh! [Chuckles]

Mr. John Dickinson.
[Clears Throat]

196
00:30:48,501 --> 00:30:51,902
Last night,
my youngest son, Charlie...

197
00:30:52,005 --> 00:30:53,939
God bless his soul...

198
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:58,669
was gunned down in cold blood
right here in our own hotel.

199
00:30:58,777 --> 00:31:04,146
The gutless murderer,
one Mr. Bill Blake,
also shot to death Miss Thel Russel,

200
00:31:04,248 --> 00:31:07,217
the fiancée
of my beloved son.

201
00:31:07,318 --> 00:31:12,254
Not only that, but he stole
a very spirited and valuable horse,

202
00:31:12,356 --> 00:31:17,691
a beautiful young pinto that belonged
to my personal family stable.

203
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:22,594
Hell, only, a pinto ain't
rightly a horse to fret much
about, if the truth be told.

204
00:31:22,698 --> 00:31:24,995
Shut up!

205
00:31:36,944 --> 00:31:41,004
You three are supposed to be
the finest killers of men and Indians...

206
00:31:41,114 --> 00:31:43,708
in this here
half of the world.

207
00:31:43,816 --> 00:31:48,445
Cole Wilson,
your reputation is already a legend.

208
00:31:48,553 --> 00:31:51,283
You I know I can trust.

209
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:55,291
Conway Twill, you're
a real good killer,

210
00:31:55,393 --> 00:31:59,386
but be sure you keep
that goddamn trap shut.

211
00:31:59,497 --> 00:32:01,726
And Johnny
"The Kid" Pickett.

212
00:32:01,831 --> 00:32:04,732
I heard tell
you killed 14 men.

213
00:32:04,834 --> 00:32:06,927
I doubt you've seen
that many years,

214
00:32:07,037 --> 00:32:11,029
and I ain't even gonna tell you
what I really think of you.

215
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:14,439
I always work alone.
Uh, excuse me there, Mr. Dickinson,

216
00:32:14,543 --> 00:32:18,740
but, uh, rightly I, I never
have worked with anyone else either.

217
00:32:18,846 --> 00:32:21,940
I never have.
Uh, yeah, m-me neither.

218
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:24,210
Shut up!

219
00:32:25,218 --> 00:32:28,415
My boy Charlie is dead!

220
00:32:30,523 --> 00:32:34,857
Oh, I ain't askin' this time.
I'm tellin',

221
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,295
and if somebody don't
like it, I'm prepared to do
a little killin' of my own.

222
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:44,333
Now, that bastard
couldn't have got too far yet.

223
00:32:44,435 --> 00:32:47,268
Well, why don't we just
say there, Mr. Dickinson, sir,

224
00:32:47,371 --> 00:32:50,169
I think we oughta start
uh, fresh in the mornin'.

225
00:32:50,274 --> 00:32:52,707
I mean, it's
well after noon now,

226
00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:55,676
and time we get finished,
all packed up and...

227
00:33:04,219 --> 00:33:07,654
I want him brought here to me...
alive or dead don't matter,

228
00:33:07,755 --> 00:33:10,747
though I reckon dead
would be easier.

229
00:33:10,858 --> 00:33:13,792
I'm a-hirin' you boys
on an exclusive basis,

230
00:33:13,893 --> 00:33:18,193
and I'm willin' to pay more money
than you've ever seen before.

231
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:22,232

232
00:33:26,138 --> 00:33:29,038

I want this out
over the wires.

Post a $500 reward
from here to hell and back.

and possum-skinnin' lowlife
in the goddamn territory.

242
00:34:55,581 --> 00:34:58,607
Bring everybody in.
I want that bastard's head.

243
00:34:58,717 --> 00:35:03,085
And make sure you include
a full description of my pinto.
I want that horse back.

Goddamn pinto is a stupid damn animal.

Got his heart so set on one.
Buy yourself a sorrel horse...

248
00:35:15,899 --> 00:35:18,662
and paint some white spots on him
as far as I'm concerned.

in a man who spends the most
part of a conversation...

00:35:24,673 --> 00:35:26,573
talkin' to a bear.

252
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,110
Talkin'
to a goddamn bear.

253
00:35:52,965 --> 00:35:55,592
The round stones
beneath the earth...

254
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,600
have spoken
through the fire.

255
00:36:02,572 --> 00:36:04,472
What?

256
00:36:04,574 --> 00:36:09,067
Things which are alike,
in nature, grow to look alike,

257
00:36:10,846 --> 00:36:14,748
and the speaking stones have lain
a long time lookin' at the sun.

258
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:24,924
The speaking stones?

259
00:36:25,025 --> 00:36:27,118
Some believe
they descend with the lightning,

260
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:32,323
but I believe they are on the ground
and are projected downward by the bolt.

261
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,135
Did you kill the white man
who killed you?

262
00:36:46,043 --> 00:36:47,943
I'm not dead.

263
00:36:52,081 --> 00:36:55,050

at birth, stupid white man?

264
00:37:00,555 --> 00:37:02,989

00:37:05,928 --> 00:37:09,055

No, I'm William Blake.

a killer of white men.

283

Yes, I swear I'm
tellin' the truth.

295

Not a goddamn word
to no one, ever.

297
00:40:03,046 --> 00:40:05,378
Don't ever ask me
no questions.

00:42:38,547 --> 00:42:40,447
Where are we?

00:42:42,183 --> 00:42:44,083
You are being followed,
William Blake.

00:42:45,253 --> 00:42:49,052
Are you sure?
I mean, how do you know?

301
00:42:54,127 --> 00:42:58,119
Often the evil stench
of white man precedes him.

302
00:43:02,535 --> 00:43:04,434
Why don't we, uh...

303
00:43:06,338 --> 00:43:08,806
Maybe we should, uh...

304
00:43:12,943 --> 00:43:15,844
What should we do?

305
00:43:15,946 --> 00:43:20,177
The eagle never lost so much
time as when he submitted

My britches been open
like that how long?

Only been ridin' a couple
of days together, but Jesus,

311
00:43:57,315 --> 00:43:59,442

mentioned the fact that...

Unsaddle

about trackin' no goddamn Injuns.

'Course I know about Cole Wilson.

And you know
what I heard?

336
00:45:55,183 --> 00:45:59,084
After he killed 'em,
he cooked 'em up and ate 'em.

337
00:46:06,626 --> 00:46:09,220
Are you telling me
he killed both his pa...

338
00:46:09,329 --> 00:46:13,389
I'm tellin' you
he killed 'em. He fucked 'em.
He cooked 'em up. He ate 'em.

339
00:46:16,135 --> 00:46:19,433
He ain't got a goddamn conscience.
You understand what I'm sayin'?

340
00:46:19,537 --> 00:46:23,871
He'd just as soon slit
our goddamn throats in the
middle of the night as walk.

your age, Jesus,

to put one in him...

344

"Johnny 'The Kid' Pickett
Slays Cole Wilson."

00:47:09,314 --> 00:47:12,111
William Blake,

346
00:47:12,216 --> 00:47:14,514
do you know how
to use this weapon?

347
00:47:21,791 --> 00:47:25,123
Not really.
That weapon will replace your tongue.

348
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:30,398
You will learn
to speak through it,

349
00:47:30,499 --> 00:47:34,059
and your poetry
will now be written with blood.

350
00:47:46,513 --> 00:47:48,446
What is your name?

351
00:47:57,956 --> 00:47:59,890
My name is Nobody.

352
00:48:02,459 --> 00:48:06,122
Excuse me?
My name is Exaybachay:

353
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:09,198
He Who Talks Loud,
Saying Nothing.

354
00:48:12,702 --> 00:48:15,034
He Who Talks...

355
00:48:15,137 --> 00:48:17,934
I thought you said
your name was Nobody.

356
00:48:19,641 --> 00:48:21,700
I prefer
to be called Nobody.

357
00:48:31,618 --> 00:48:33,518
[Blake]
Nobody?

358
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:37,454
Um, shouldn't you be
with your own tribe or somethin'?

359
00:48:41,827 --> 00:48:44,352
My blood is mixed.

360
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:47,659
My mother was
Ohm gahpi phi gun ni.

361
00:48:49,033 --> 00:48:51,092
My father is
Abso luka.

362
00:48:53,837 --> 00:48:56,362
This mixture
was not respected.

363
00:48:56,473 --> 00:48:58,771
As a small boy,

364
00:48:58,875 --> 00:49:01,104
I was often left
to myself.

365
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:04,407
So I spent many months
stalking the elk people...

366
00:49:04,513 --> 00:49:08,004
to prove I would soon
become a good hunter.

367
00:49:08,116 --> 00:49:11,984
One day, finally,
my elk relatives took pity on me,

368
00:49:12,086 --> 00:49:14,519
and a young elk
gave his life to me.

369
00:49:15,756 --> 00:49:18,987
With only my knife,
I took his life.

370
00:49:19,092 --> 00:49:24,154
As I was preparing to cut the meat,
white men came upon me.

371
00:49:24,263 --> 00:49:26,254
They were English soldiers.

372
00:49:26,365 --> 00:49:30,528
I cut one with my knife, but they
hit me on the head with a rifle.

373
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:34,169
All went black.

374
00:49:34,272 --> 00:49:36,171
My spirit seemed
to leave me.

375
00:49:38,509 --> 00:49:41,273
[Neighing]
I was then taken east...

376
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:44,346
in a cage.

377
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:47,780
I was taken to Toronto,
then Philadelphia...

378
00:49:49,285 --> 00:49:51,275
and then to New York.

379
00:49:51,386 --> 00:49:55,117
And each time I arrived
in another city,

380
00:49:55,223 --> 00:49:57,191
somehow the white men
had moved...

381
00:49:57,292 --> 00:49:59,225
all their people there
ahead of me.

382
00:50:01,862 --> 00:50:05,763
Each new city contained
the same white people as the last,

383
00:50:05,865 --> 00:50:08,891
and I could not understand
how a whole city of people...

384
00:50:09,002 --> 00:50:10,902
could be moved
so quickly.

385
00:50:13,639 --> 00:50:17,040
Eventually, I was
taken on a ship...

386
00:50:17,142 --> 00:50:19,440
across the great sea...

387
00:50:19,545 --> 00:50:21,603
over to England,

388
00:50:21,713 --> 00:50:24,045
and I was paraded
before them...

389
00:50:24,148 --> 00:50:26,275
like a captured animal,

390
00:50:26,384 --> 00:50:28,283
an exhibit.

391
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:33,421
And so I mimicked them,
imitating their ways,

392
00:50:33,523 --> 00:50:37,788
hoping that they might lose interest
in this young savage,

393
00:50:37,893 --> 00:50:40,259
but their interest
only grew.

394
00:50:40,363 --> 00:50:42,557
So they placed me into
the white man's schools.

395
00:50:44,633 --> 00:50:46,828
It was there
that I discovered...

396
00:50:46,935 --> 00:50:49,198
in a book...

397
00:50:49,303 --> 00:50:52,295
the words that you,
William Blake, had written.

398
00:50:54,875 --> 00:50:58,241
They were powerful words,
and they spoke to me.

399
00:51:01,214 --> 00:51:05,149
But I made careful plans,
and I eventually escaped.

400
00:51:07,853 --> 00:51:10,844
Once again, I crossed
the great ocean.

401
00:51:12,523 --> 00:51:14,514
I saw many sad things...

402
00:51:14,625 --> 00:51:18,253
as I made my way back
to the lands of my people.

403
00:51:18,361 --> 00:51:21,296
Once they realized
who I was,

404
00:51:21,398 --> 00:51:23,559
the stories of my adventures
angered them.

405
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,200
They called me a liar.

406
00:51:27,302 --> 00:51:31,671
"Exaybachay."
He Who Talks Loud, Saying Nothing.

407
00:51:33,241 --> 00:51:35,766
They ridiculed me.
My own people.

408
00:51:37,345 --> 00:51:40,142
And I was left to wander
the earth alone.

409
00:51:43,316 --> 00:51:45,216
I am Nobody.

410
00:51:51,657 --> 00:51:55,114
[Twill] Ain't ya glad the sun
kind of sets? Prepares you like?

411
00:51:55,226 --> 00:51:59,356
I mean, what if it, like, went
out sudden, like, say, blowin'
out a candle or somethin'?

412
00:51:59,464 --> 00:52:02,364
I mean... You know, one minute
we're ridin' along, we can
see everything and each other...

413
00:52:02,466 --> 00:52:06,027
and, boom, the next minute is just...
you're in total darkness.

414
00:52:06,136 --> 00:52:08,331
That'd scare
the bejesus outta me.

415
00:52:12,942 --> 00:52:17,401
[Man] Once upon a time,
there were three bears in the forest.

416
00:52:17,512 --> 00:52:20,777
A big bear,
a medium mommy bear...

417
00:52:20,882 --> 00:52:23,406
and a tiny
little baby bear.

418
00:52:23,517 --> 00:52:27,783
One mornin', they were gonna eat
their breakfast porridge.

419
00:52:27,888 --> 00:52:31,846
They had a big bowl,
a medium bowl and a tiny little bowl.

420
00:52:31,958 --> 00:52:34,085
That porridge was too hot.

421
00:52:34,194 --> 00:52:36,424
Stupid white man.

422
00:52:38,063 --> 00:52:41,931
So they went to take a walk.
William Blake, you go to them.

423
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:45,491
Along came this girl. She was...
What?

424
00:52:47,538 --> 00:52:50,234
Alone? Why don't we
just go around them?

425
00:52:50,341 --> 00:52:52,638
No!

426
00:52:52,743 --> 00:52:54,768
You go.

427
00:52:54,878 --> 00:52:56,778
[Nobody]
It's a test.

428
00:52:58,548 --> 00:53:02,278
I don't know those people,
and they don't look very friendly.

429
00:53:02,384 --> 00:53:05,683
What if they kill me?
Nobody will observe.

430
00:53:05,788 --> 00:53:08,620
She got sleepy, and she
went into their bedroom.

431
00:53:08,723 --> 00:53:11,920
There was a big bed, a medium
bed and a tiny little bed.
All right.

432
00:53:12,026 --> 00:53:14,153
I'll go.
...their tiny bed.

433
00:53:14,262 --> 00:53:16,821
I'd rather not,
but I'll go.

434
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:20,093
The bears got home.
Papa said,

435
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,929
"Somebody here ate
all our porridge."

436
00:53:24,403 --> 00:53:27,964
What's the best way to get down there?
Be quiet and go.

437
00:53:28,074 --> 00:53:29,973
And he scalped her,
All right.

438
00:53:30,075 --> 00:53:33,135
And he tore her head
off her body.

439
00:53:33,245 --> 00:53:37,704
And he took that golden hair,
and he made a sweater for baby bear.

440
00:53:37,815 --> 00:53:40,613
That's terrible.
Tonight we're reminded...

441
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:44,278
of the evil emperor
Nero Augustus.

442
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:48,118
He was the scourge
of all the Christians.

443
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:50,317
What's a scourge?

444
00:53:50,426 --> 00:53:53,792
It's... It's like when
somethin' real bad happens.

445
00:53:53,896 --> 00:53:57,423
Like when everybody gets killed
and you can't do anything about it.

446
00:53:57,533 --> 00:53:59,932
Like a swarm of locusts.

447
00:54:00,034 --> 00:54:02,525
For the entertainment
of his guests,

448
00:54:02,637 --> 00:54:04,537
Nero would illuminate
his whole garden...

449
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:08,574
with bodies of live Christians
covered in burning oil...

450
00:54:08,675 --> 00:54:12,804
strung up
on flaming crosses, crucified.

451
00:54:15,181 --> 00:54:18,150
And at dinner,

452
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:20,410
he would have the Christians
rubbed by his guards...

453
00:54:20,518 --> 00:54:24,181
with aromatic herbs
and garlic...

454
00:54:24,289 --> 00:54:27,280
and sewn up into sacks.

455
00:54:27,391 --> 00:54:30,690
And then they'd throw
these sacks to the wild dogs.

456
00:54:30,794 --> 00:54:32,819
Well, that's terrible.

457
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:36,330
It's horrible.
Terrible's what it is.

458
00:54:38,034 --> 00:54:41,526
You know, I just... I can't
drink whiskey like I used to could.

459
00:54:41,637 --> 00:54:43,763
My old belly
just ain't no account.

460
00:54:43,872 --> 00:54:46,306
I get the shits every time,
don't you know?

461
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:48,535
I'm sorry, Big George.

462
00:54:48,643 --> 00:54:52,908
I got some food here that
even Goldilocks never tasted.

463
00:54:53,013 --> 00:54:55,504
I think this is gonna
fix up your old gut.

464
00:55:04,189 --> 00:55:07,647
These beans is shit.

465
00:55:07,759 --> 00:55:11,057
Why don't you shut your goddamn trap
and just eat your beans?

466
00:55:11,162 --> 00:55:15,929
Them, uh... There's possum
in these beans, and spices too.

467
00:55:16,033 --> 00:55:18,466
I tried hard.
Well, Sally,

468
00:55:18,568 --> 00:55:20,468
I don't give a pig's ass
what anybody says.

469
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:22,800
I still say you make
a hell of a pot of beans.

470
00:55:22,906 --> 00:55:26,363
Now why don't you say us
a grace outta the Good Book, would you?

471
00:55:26,475 --> 00:55:29,103
Thank you, Big George.
I'd be delighted to do that.

472
00:55:35,617 --> 00:55:39,644
"This day will the Lord
deliver thee into mine hand;

473
00:55:39,754 --> 00:55:44,383
And I will smite thee, and
take thine head from thee;

474
00:55:44,491 --> 00:55:48,586
And I will give the carcasses of
the host of the Philistines this day...

475
00:55:48,694 --> 00:55:52,323
unto the fowls of the air
and the wild beasts of the earth."

476
00:55:52,431 --> 00:55:54,331
[Together]
Amen.

477
00:55:54,433 --> 00:55:58,528
What's a Philistine?
Well, it's just a real dirty person.

478
00:55:59,971 --> 00:56:02,268
[Plates Clattering,
Men Scuffling]

479
00:56:04,775 --> 00:56:07,403
Hello.

480
00:56:07,511 --> 00:56:10,911
I smelled beans.

481
00:56:13,449 --> 00:56:15,349
Who are you
travelin' with?

482
00:56:16,785 --> 00:56:19,117
I'm with Nobody.

483
00:56:19,221 --> 00:56:21,121
Where you headed?

484
00:56:23,858 --> 00:56:25,758
I don't know.

485
00:56:30,798 --> 00:56:33,425
Do you like beans?
I...

486
00:56:33,533 --> 00:56:35,558
I love beans.
[Chuckles]

487
00:56:37,137 --> 00:56:39,400
Have you got
any tobacco?

488
00:56:39,505 --> 00:56:42,474
I'm sorry. I don't smoke.
Would you give me some tobacco?

489
00:56:42,574 --> 00:56:46,907
I would if I had some.
I'll trade you some beans
for some tobacco.

490
00:56:47,011 --> 00:56:49,502
I don't have any tobacco,
but I'd love some beans.

491
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:51,514
Hurt.

492
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:54,083
Yes.
Eyeglasses.

493
00:56:56,086 --> 00:56:59,283
Yes.
Pretty suit too.

494
00:56:59,389 --> 00:57:01,686
I clean up real good, you know.
Is that right?

495
00:57:01,791 --> 00:57:04,555
Yeah.
What size shoes are those?

496
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:07,890
Ten.
They look very comfortable. Are they?

497
00:57:07,996 --> 00:57:10,556
Not too bad.

498
00:57:10,665 --> 00:57:13,156
What kinda flower
is that?

499
00:57:13,268 --> 00:57:17,260
Well, it's a rose...

500
00:57:17,371 --> 00:57:19,271
that's made out of paper.

501
00:57:19,373 --> 00:57:22,034
Paper?
Rose.
Now you see there?

502
00:57:25,411 --> 00:57:27,311
Look at the edge on that knife.
Hmm.

503
00:57:27,413 --> 00:57:29,312
Feel that.
I'd rather not.

504
00:57:29,414 --> 00:57:31,314
Aw, go on.

505
00:57:33,018 --> 00:57:37,351
Hmm.
That... That is a very,
very sharp knife, that is.

506
00:57:37,455 --> 00:57:39,355
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Yeah. Yeah.

507
00:57:39,457 --> 00:57:42,085
[Chuckles]
What do you call it?

508
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:46,353
Pretty.
I'm sorry?

509
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,363
That hat.
What do you call it?

510
00:57:51,533 --> 00:57:53,967
I'm really not sure.

511
00:57:54,069 --> 00:57:57,300
Ah, your hair.
Your hair is soft.

512
00:57:57,406 --> 00:57:59,396
It's like a girl's.

513
00:57:59,507 --> 00:58:01,407
By God, it is soft.

514
00:58:03,244 --> 00:58:05,178
Now how do you
get it that way?

515
00:58:05,279 --> 00:58:09,510
See, this old stuff of mine, it just...
Well, it's just like old barn hay.

516
00:58:09,616 --> 00:58:12,210
There ain't a durn thing
you can do with it.
Hm.

517
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:15,685
How do you... How do you get it
that way and keep it like that?

518
00:58:16,756 --> 00:58:19,350
Just lucky, I guess.

519
00:58:19,458 --> 00:58:21,687
[Men]
