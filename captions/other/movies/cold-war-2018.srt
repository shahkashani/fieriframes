something new to your repertoire.

About Land Reform,
World Peace and the threats to it.

A strong number about
the Leader of the World Proletariat.

195
00:20:48,751 --> 00:20:53,292
And we, in turn, will do everything
in our power to show our gratitude.

on behalf of the whole ensemble

for your appreciation
of our hard work.

200
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:14,876
But when it comes to our repertoire,
it's based on authentic folk art.

Comrade Bielecka,
I assure you that our nation

207
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:37,709
is not so ignorant,
including its rural elements.

208
00:21:37,834 --> 00:21:41,876
Quite the contrary.
And it will sing about those issues.

209
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:44,542
As long as it is encouraged...

210
00:21:45,292 --> 00:21:48,667
and given direction.

211
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:53,834
This, I believe, is exactly
what the role of our ensemble should be.
