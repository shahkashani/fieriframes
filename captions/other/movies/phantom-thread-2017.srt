1
00:00:47,093 --> 00:00:49,742
Reynolds has made my
dreams come true.

2
00:00:51,766 --> 00:00:55,204
And I have given him what
he desires most in return.

3
00:00:56,844 --> 00:00:58,102
And what's that?

4
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:04,174
Every piece of me.

5
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,075
He's a very demanding man,
isn't he?

6
00:01:13,003 --> 00:01:15,354
Must be quite a challenge
to be with him.

7
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:17,143
Yes.

8
00:01:18,526 --> 00:01:20,814
Maybe he is the
most demanding man.

9
00:02:54,795 --> 00:02:56,053
Morning, ladies.

10
00:03:00,248 --> 00:03:01,771
-Morning.
-Morning, Madame.

11
00:03:02,732 --> 00:03:04,005
Good morning, ladies.

12
00:03:25,591 --> 00:03:28,198
-Good morning, Biddy.
-Good morning, Mr. Woodcock.

13
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,315
-Morning, Nana.
-Morning, Mr. Woodcock.

14
00:03:30,393 --> 00:03:31,995
-Pippa.
-Morning, sir.

15
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:16,900
Try these.

16
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:21,040
Reynolds?

17
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,173
They're delicious.

18
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,748
Remember I told you, Johanna?

19
00:04:27,407 --> 00:04:29,476
No more sludgy things.

20
00:04:31,587 --> 00:04:33,052
I didn’t know that.

21
00:04:36,165 --> 00:04:38,209
You may have told
it to someone else.

22
00:04:48,735 --> 00:04:49,782
Morning.

23
00:04:49,852 --> 00:04:51,852
Morning, my old so-and-so.

24
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:12,851
Where have you gone, Reynolds?

25
00:05:15,876 --> 00:05:17,818
There's nothing I can say...

26
00:05:18,063 --> 00:05:21,014
to get your attention
aimed back at me...

27
00:05:21,782 --> 00:05:23,029
Is there?

28
00:05:25,788 --> 00:05:28,795
I cannot begin my day
with a confrontation.

29
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:29,905
Please?

30
00:05:30,994 --> 00:05:33,041
I'm delivering the dress today...

31
00:05:33,783 --> 00:05:36,775
and I can't take up space
with a confrontation.

32
00:05:36,986 --> 00:05:39,697
I simply don't have time
for confrontations.

33
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:18,045
Good morning, Countess.

34
00:06:18,263 --> 00:06:19,842
Good morning, Cyril.

35
00:06:20,131 --> 00:06:21,685
Good morning, Peter.

36
00:06:35,056 --> 00:06:37,134
Who's this beautiful stranger?

37
00:06:38,704 --> 00:06:41,689
I need to see you
far more often, Henrietta.

38
00:06:43,072 --> 00:06:44,876
I am very excited.

39
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:47,541
I am, too. Come in.

40
00:07:23,637 --> 00:07:24,684
Exquisite.

41
00:07:53,943 --> 00:07:55,060
Yes?

42
00:07:55,466 --> 00:07:57,263
Let's take it for a walk.

43
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,989
Beautiful work, ladies.
Thank you very much.

44
00:08:15,555 --> 00:08:17,735
It's beautiful, Reynolds.

45
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:21,985
Worth everything
we've been through.

46
00:08:25,026 --> 00:08:27,396
I feel like it would
give me courage.

47
00:08:44,888 --> 00:08:47,631
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
take your seats, please.</i>

48
00:08:56,445 --> 00:08:58,008
-She here?
-Yes, sir.

49
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,923
Well, what do you want to do
about Johanna?

50
00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:30,178
I mean, she's lovely,
but the time has come.

51
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:34,453
And she's getting
fat sitting around

52
00:09:34,478 --> 00:09:36,891
waiting for you to fall
in love with her again.

53
00:09:40,267 --> 00:09:42,206
I'll give her the October dress.

54
00:09:44,282 --> 00:09:45,658
That's all right?

55
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:55,177
I have an unsettled feeling...

56
00:09:55,954 --> 00:09:57,775
based on...

57
00:09:57,954 --> 00:10:00,401
nothing I can put my finger on.

58
00:10:00,798 --> 00:10:02,580
Just butterflies.

59
00:10:03,321 --> 00:10:06,964
Been having the strongest
memories of Mama lately.

60
00:10:07,728 --> 00:10:09,813
Coming to me in my dreams...

61
00:10:11,134 --> 00:10:12,898
Smelling her scent...

62
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,481
The strongest sense that...

63
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:19,864
she's near us.

64
00:10:21,462 --> 00:10:23,398
And reaching out towards us.

65
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,492
Very much hope that she saw
the dress tonight, don't you?

66
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,945
Yes.

67
00:10:35,423 --> 00:10:36,770
It's comforting

68
00:10:36,895 --> 00:10:40,145
to think the dead are watching
over the living.

69
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,775
I don't find that spooky at all.

70
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,552
Why don't you go
to the country tonight?

71
00:10:53,267 --> 00:10:54,649
I'll follow tomorrow.

72
00:10:55,868 --> 00:10:57,181
Good idea.

73
00:10:59,642 --> 00:11:01,489
I like that idea very much.

74
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:04,052
My old so-and-so.

75
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,538
Mr. Hansford?

76
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:00,359
Mr. Hansford, hello?

77
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,448
-Good morning.
-Morning.

78
00:12:02,546 --> 00:12:06,070
Fill us up please.
And check the oil and tires.

79
00:12:10,005 --> 00:12:11,090
Lots of frost this morning.

80
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,945
It's cold, innit? It's very bitter.

81
00:13:37,828 --> 00:13:40,290
-Good morning.
-Morning.

82
00:13:40,883 --> 00:13:42,829
What would you like to order?

83
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,790
A Welsh rabbit.

84
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,619
With a poached egg
on top, please.

85
00:13:54,937 --> 00:13:56,323
Not too runny.

86
00:13:56,914 --> 00:13:58,385
And bacon.

87
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:00,471
Scones.

88
00:14:01,406 --> 00:14:03,463
Butter, cream.

89
00:14:05,203 --> 00:14:06,346
Jam.

90
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,190
Not strawberry.

91
00:14:11,781 --> 00:14:12,737
No.

92
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,265
Raspberry.

93
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,828
What else?

94
00:14:20,477 --> 00:14:21,625
Coffee or tea?

95
00:14:21,781 --> 00:14:23,197
Do you have lapsang?

96
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,098
I'll have a pot
of lapsang, please.

97
00:14:26,221 --> 00:14:27,333
Good choice.

98
00:14:27,578 --> 00:14:29,144
And some sausages.

99
00:14:30,523 --> 00:14:32,390
And some sausages.

100
00:14:38,187 --> 00:14:39,562
Show me.

101
00:14:48,552 --> 00:14:50,216
Will you remember?

102
00:14:50,808 --> 00:14:52,012
Yes.

103
00:14:53,965 --> 00:14:55,309
I'm keeping this.

104
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,805
And now?

105
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,518
Will you have dinner with me?

106
00:15:30,143 --> 00:15:31,236
Yes.

107
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:49,415
<i>For the hungry boy.
My name is Alma.</i>

108
00:16:13,593 --> 00:16:15,937
-Am I late?
-No.

109
00:16:43,231 --> 00:16:44,497
What do you think?

110
00:16:46,231 --> 00:16:47,098
Hm.

111
00:16:48,161 --> 00:16:49,560
I like the sauce.

112
00:16:50,778 --> 00:16:52,098
Custard.

113
00:16:57,169 --> 00:16:58,694
It's quite good.

114
00:17:05,723 --> 00:17:07,304
May I, Alma?

115
00:17:09,788 --> 00:17:11,889
I like to see who I'm talking to.

116
00:17:18,106 --> 00:17:19,192
Here.

117
00:17:31,126 --> 00:17:32,157
There you are.

118
00:17:32,331 --> 00:17:33,688
That's better.

119
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,196
Does you mother have brown eyes?

120
00:17:39,168 --> 00:17:40,230
Green.

121
00:17:40,504 --> 00:17:42,027
Do you look very much like her?

122
00:17:43,718 --> 00:17:45,503
I don't know. I think so.

123
00:17:46,513 --> 00:17:47,934
Do you have a photograph?

124
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:49,974
Yes.

125
00:17:50,255 --> 00:17:51,529
Will you let me see it?

126
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:53,967
Not here, at home.

127
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:57,999
Carry it with you.

128
00:18:00,109 --> 00:18:01,952
Always carry her with you.

129
00:18:06,626 --> 00:18:07,759
Where's yours?

130
00:18:08,725 --> 00:18:09,788
Your mother?

131
00:18:10,454 --> 00:18:12,311
She's here in the canvas.

132
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,747
-What do you mean?
-Hm.

133
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:24,368
You can sew almost anything
into the canvas of a coat.

134
00:18:27,304 --> 00:18:28,539
Secrets.

135
00:18:30,062 --> 00:18:31,094
Coins.

136
00:18:31,593 --> 00:18:33,445
Words, little messages.

137
00:18:35,139 --> 00:18:37,343
When I was a boy, I started to

138
00:18:37,444 --> 00:18:40,171
hide things in the linings
of the garments.

139
00:18:40,923 --> 00:18:43,056
Things that only
I knew were there.

140
00:18:44,711 --> 00:18:47,828
And over my breast, I have
a lock of my mother's hair.

141
00:18:48,851 --> 00:18:51,070
To keep her
close to me always.

142
00:18:53,328 --> 00:18:56,446
She's quite a remarkable woman.
She taught me my trade.

143
00:18:56,914 --> 00:19:00,039
So, I try to
never be without her.

144
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,827
You must love her very much.

145
00:19:32,924 --> 00:19:33,908
Hello.

146
00:19:34,393 --> 00:19:36,386
This is Alma.
Say hello to Alma.

147
00:19:36,524 --> 00:19:37,394
Hello.

148
00:19:38,982 --> 00:19:40,576
Come on, come on.

149
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,552
-Hello.
-Watch over the house.

150
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,769
I made this dress for her
when I was 16 years old.

151
00:20:04,824 --> 00:20:05,957
Beautiful.

152
00:20:06,318 --> 00:20:08,889
It was for her second husband,
their wedding.

153
00:20:09,389 --> 00:20:11,858
My father had died
many years before.

154
00:20:12,682 --> 00:20:15,627
Our nanny, the evil
Miss Blackwood...

155
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,370
"The Black Death"
we used to call her,

156
00:20:18,849 --> 00:20:21,966
because of superstition, she
refused to help me sew the dress

157
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:25,029
as she believed it would
bring her bad fortune...

158
00:20:25,372 --> 00:20:26,779
to never be a bride.

159
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,211
Not that anyone
would've had her.

160
00:20:29,772 --> 00:20:32,961
And she seemed ancient to us,
I've no idea how old she actually was.

161
00:20:33,009 --> 00:20:35,095
And monstrously ugly.

162
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,576
So...

163
00:20:37,311 --> 00:20:40,670
I worked alone for months
and months, hunched over.

164
00:20:40,928 --> 00:20:43,874
Sewing and sweating and sewing.

165
00:20:45,148 --> 00:20:47,093
And the Black Death
never married anyway.

166
00:20:47,258 --> 00:20:49,429
The help I could've had from her.

167
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:53,590
It was my sister, Cyril,
came to my rescue in the end.

168
00:20:55,146 --> 00:20:57,271
There were endless superstitions

169
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,485
when making a wedding dress.

170
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:02,833
Young girls are afraid they'll
never marry if they touch one.

171
00:21:03,045 --> 00:21:04,935
Models afraid they'll...

172
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:08,528
marry only bald men
if they put one on.

173
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:14,775
And where's the dress now?

174
00:21:18,174 --> 00:21:20,520
I have no idea
what happened to it.

175
00:21:20,887 --> 00:21:21,926
No idea.

176
00:21:22,176 --> 00:21:24,738
Um, it's probably turned
to ashes by now.

177
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:26,817
Fallen to pieces.

178
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,527
And... your sister?

179
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,324
What?

180
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:36,075
Did she ever marry?

181
00:21:37,723 --> 00:21:38,716
No.

182
00:21:39,864 --> 00:21:41,746
Come over, let's have a fire.

183
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,915
If you want to have a staring
contest with me, you will lose.

184
00:22:08,353 --> 00:22:09,182
Hm.

185
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,708
You are a very handsome man.

186
00:22:28,677 --> 00:22:31,341
You must be around
many beautiful women.

187
00:22:36,842 --> 00:22:37,889
Yes.

188
00:22:41,796 --> 00:22:43,335
Why are you not married?

189
00:22:44,116 --> 00:22:45,592
I make dresses.

190
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,952
You cannot be married
when you make dresses?

191
00:22:50,373 --> 00:22:52,763
I'm certain I was
never meant to marry.

192
00:22:53,021 --> 00:22:55,107
I'm a confirmed bachelor.

193
00:22:58,147 --> 00:22:59,670
I'm incurable.

194
00:23:00,976 --> 00:23:01,999
Hmm.

195
00:23:05,058 --> 00:23:06,660
Marriage would
make me deceitful,

196
00:23:06,769 --> 00:23:08,840
and I don't ever want that.

197
00:23:12,171 --> 00:23:14,273
You sound so sure about things.

198
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:16,477
I'm sure about that.

199
00:23:21,396 --> 00:23:23,857
I think you are
only acting strong.

200
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,897
No, I am strong.

201
00:23:30,292 --> 00:23:31,417
For who?

202
00:23:31,581 --> 00:23:33,182
Not for me, I hope.

203
00:23:36,177 --> 00:23:40,142
I think it's the expectations
and assumptions of others...

204
00:23:40,954 --> 00:23:42,498
that cause heartache.

205
00:23:52,524 --> 00:23:54,282
Would you help me
with something?

206
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,860
-Yes.
-Come on.

207
00:24:12,271 --> 00:24:14,653
Good, just jump up
on the box for me.

208
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:14,942
Um...

209
00:25:18,605 --> 00:25:20,258
I think we're going to try and...

210
00:25:21,385 --> 00:25:23,189
pull this back for you.

211
00:25:49,062 --> 00:25:50,320
Pretty good.

212
00:25:51,031 --> 00:25:52,234
A moment.

213
00:25:57,412 --> 00:26:00,475
Save that one for
another time.

214
00:26:07,973 --> 00:26:09,216
Quite nice.

215
00:26:13,818 --> 00:26:14,974
Hmm.

216
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:19,158
Dead serious.

217
00:26:35,248 --> 00:26:36,434
This one.

218
00:26:38,692 --> 00:26:39,926
Do you like it?

219
00:26:41,888 --> 00:26:44,279
-Yes.
-It's pretty good.

220
00:26:54,744 --> 00:26:55,752
That's it.

221
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:58,220
Let's get that off you and then...

222
00:26:58,431 --> 00:27:00,829
I'd like to take your measurements.
Is that all right?

223
00:27:17,276 --> 00:27:21,119
And who is this lovely creature
making the house smell so nice?

224
00:27:21,869 --> 00:27:23,517
Hello, I'm Alma.

225
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:25,629
I'm Cyril.

226
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,332
Sandalwood and rose water.

227
00:27:39,092 --> 00:27:42,577
Hmm, sherry... and...

228
00:27:43,383 --> 00:27:44,977
lemon juice?

229
00:27:45,907 --> 00:27:48,587
Mm, mm-hmm, we had
fish for dinner.

230
00:27:49,064 --> 00:27:52,002
My old sew-and-sew.
Would you mind?

231
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:35,776
Will you step towards me.
Ready?

232
00:28:40,902 --> 00:28:42,199
Thirty-two.

233
00:28:44,854 --> 00:28:45,987
Thirty.

234
00:28:47,915 --> 00:28:49,118
Thirty-one.

235
00:28:54,264 --> 00:28:56,405
Thirty-five and a half.

236
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,329
Fourteen and a half.

237
00:29:03,845 --> 00:29:05,322
Seventeen.

238
00:29:05,564 --> 00:29:06,767
Twenty.

239
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,071
Just stand normally.

240
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:11,134
Yes.

241
00:29:13,563 --> 00:29:14,692
I stand normally.

242
00:29:14,762 --> 00:29:16,090
Like before.

243
00:29:17,235 --> 00:29:18,692
-What do you mean?
-Straight.

244
00:29:18,794 --> 00:29:19,544
Straight?

245
00:29:19,575 --> 00:29:21,388
-Like that.
-Yeah, you didn't say that.

246
00:29:30,722 --> 00:29:32,347
Sixteen and a half.

247
00:29:36,355 --> 00:29:37,620
Eight and a half.

248
00:29:38,011 --> 00:29:40,988
You have no breasts.
Twenty-two.

249
00:29:42,354 --> 00:29:44,179
-Yes, I know.
-Thirty-two and a half.

250
00:29:44,265 --> 00:29:45,640
You can drop your arm now.

251
00:29:46,261 --> 00:29:47,444
I'm sorry.

252
00:29:47,663 --> 00:29:49,206
No, no, you're perfect.

253
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,733
My job to give you some.

254
00:29:54,413 --> 00:29:55,897
If I choose to.

255
00:29:58,803 --> 00:29:59,896
Ten.

256
00:30:01,385 --> 00:30:02,448
Nine.

257
00:30:03,526 --> 00:30:04,760
Six and a half.

258
00:30:06,842 --> 00:30:09,452
Twenty...five.

259
00:30:10,249 --> 00:30:12,097
And... forty-five.

260
00:30:12,457 --> 00:30:13,566
That's it.

261
00:30:21,603 --> 00:30:23,220
Would you try
something else for me?

262
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:24,720
Yes.

263
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,230
You have the ideal shape.

264
00:30:39,515 --> 00:30:40,930
-I do?
-Hm.

265
00:30:42,422 --> 00:30:43,946
He likes a little belly.

266
00:31:06,194 --> 00:31:08,030
<i>I never really liked myself.</i>

267
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,486
<i>I thought my...</i>

268
00:31:13,611 --> 00:31:15,290
<i>shoulders were too wide.</i>

269
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,283
<i>My neck was
skinny like a bird.</i>

270
00:31:20,968 --> 00:31:22,734
<i>That I had no breasts.</i>

271
00:31:25,574 --> 00:31:28,731
<i>I felt my...
hips were larger than needed.</i>

272
00:31:28,967 --> 00:31:31,085
<i>And my arms strong.</i>

273
00:31:36,766 --> 00:31:40,164
I feel as if I've been looking
for you for a very long time.

274
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:47,531
You found me.

275
00:31:53,063 --> 00:31:54,884
Whatever you do...

276
00:31:55,829 --> 00:31:57,446
do it carefully.

277
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:13,072
<i>But in his work,
I've become perfect.</i>

278
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,299
<i>And I feel just right.</i>

279
00:32:27,514 --> 00:32:31,139
<i>Maybe that's how all women
feel...in his clothes.</i>

280
00:33:01,527 --> 00:33:03,285
You look beautiful.

281
00:33:03,832 --> 00:33:04,941
Really.

282
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:07,058
Very beautiful.

283
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:10,700
You're making me
extremely hungry.

284
00:33:12,912 --> 00:33:16,053
-I ordered you a steak tartare.
-Oh, perfect. Thank you.

285
00:33:16,147 --> 00:33:17,858
My little carnivore.

286
00:33:18,731 --> 00:33:21,788
I've just been on the telephone
to your favorite client.

287
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:23,131
Mm-hmm.

288
00:33:23,699 --> 00:33:26,121
Barbara Rose is getting
married again.

289
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:28,157
Oh, goody.

290
00:33:28,912 --> 00:33:30,826
All right, well...

291
00:33:30,943 --> 00:33:32,990
I think I better have
another one of these.

292
00:33:49,802 --> 00:33:51,091
That's your room.

293
00:33:52,832 --> 00:33:54,551
I'm right next door.

294
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,428
Get your rest.

295
00:33:59,582 --> 00:34:01,988
We'll start early
in the morning.

296
00:34:03,027 --> 00:34:04,395
How early?

297
00:34:07,029 --> 00:34:08,179
I'll wake you.

298
00:34:10,202 --> 00:34:11,241
Night.

299
00:34:12,233 --> 00:34:13,342
Goodnight.

300
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:35,273
<i>Sometimes, we wake up
at four in the morning...</i>

301
00:34:36,165 --> 00:34:38,540
<i>after we'd gone to
bed at midnight.</i>

302
00:34:39,783 --> 00:34:41,681
<i>And then he's ready
to start again.</i>

303
00:34:44,227 --> 00:34:46,461
And I can stand endlessly.

304
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,344
No one can stand
as long as I can.

305
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:53,641
What is it, Alma?

306
00:34:54,728 --> 00:34:57,438
What are you looking
so forlorn about, hm?

307
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:59,445
I don't know, I...

308
00:34:59,851 --> 00:35:02,430
I don't think I like
the fabric so much.

309
00:35:06,019 --> 00:35:08,800
Well, Alma, this fabric is adored

310
00:35:08,854 --> 00:35:10,995
by the women who
wear our design.

311
00:35:12,649 --> 00:35:14,500
It's perfect for this dress.

312
00:35:15,016 --> 00:35:16,649
Cyril is right.

313
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Cyril is always right.

314
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,184
It's not because the
fabric is adored

315
00:35:24,248 --> 00:35:26,535
by the clients
that Cyril is right.

316
00:35:26,688 --> 00:35:28,673
It's right because it's right.

317
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:31,513
Because it's beautiful.

318
00:35:33,794 --> 00:35:36,230
Maybe one day you will
change your taste, Alma.

319
00:35:39,934 --> 00:35:41,254
Maybe not.

320
00:35:41,982 --> 00:35:43,936
Maybe you have no taste.

321
00:35:45,915 --> 00:35:47,665
Maybe I like my own taste.

322
00:35:48,998 --> 00:35:51,577
Yeah, it's just enough
to get you into trouble.

323
00:35:53,247 --> 00:35:54,778
Perhaps I'm looking for trouble.

324
00:35:54,859 --> 00:35:56,084
Stop.

325
00:36:01,449 --> 00:36:03,275
Excuse me, Mr. Woodcock.

326
00:36:03,408 --> 00:36:04,341
Yes?

327
00:36:05,293 --> 00:36:06,676
I would like to say
that I hope one day

328
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:08,870
I could wear one
of your dresses.

329
00:36:09,575 --> 00:36:10,637
Well, thank you.

330
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:13,091
If that's your wish, I hope
it comes true for you.

331
00:36:13,418 --> 00:36:14,495
She really means it.

332
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,419
She told me she wants to be
buried in a dress that you made.

333
00:36:20,183 --> 00:36:21,233
-Thank you.
-Thank you,

334
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:23,351
ladies for your kind words.
Good night.

335
00:36:23,754 --> 00:36:24,732
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

336
00:36:24,757 --> 00:36:26,724
-Good night.
-Good night. Thank you very much.

337
00:36:27,465 --> 00:36:30,162
You'd dig her up and sell the
dress again, wouldn't you, Nigel?

338
00:36:30,225 --> 00:36:31,889
Well, otherwise it would seem to

339
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,709
be going to a waste,
but yeah, any wombat can try.

340
00:36:34,736 --> 00:36:37,080
Nigel, why don't you
watch your words?

341
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,575
What?

342
00:36:40,668 --> 00:36:42,449
Have you had enough to eat?

343
00:36:48,301 --> 00:36:49,869
You seem thirsty.

344
00:37:22,328 --> 00:37:23,797
Morning, Reynolds.

345
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,122
Morning, Cyril.

346
00:38:02,963 --> 00:38:06,213
Please, don't move
so much, Alma.

347
00:38:09,394 --> 00:38:13,119
I'm...buttering my toast.
I'm not moving too much.

348
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:14,580
Well, it's too much.

349
00:38:14,996 --> 00:38:17,732
It's a distraction.
It's very distracting.

350
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,791
Maybe you...

351
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,729
pay too much attention to it.

352
00:38:27,095 --> 00:38:28,915
It's hard to ignore.

353
00:38:29,251 --> 00:38:31,907
It's as if you just rode
a horse across the room.

354
00:38:37,712 --> 00:38:39,258
It's too much movement.

355
00:38:40,233 --> 00:38:43,522
It's entirely too much
movement at breakfast.

356
00:38:58,965 --> 00:39:01,403
Perhaps you should take
your breakfast after him.

357
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:05,562
Or in your room?

358
00:39:08,198 --> 00:39:10,010
I think he's being too fussy.

359
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:13,807
His routine when he's in it
is best not shaken.

360
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:16,166
-Well...
-This is a quiet time.

361
00:39:17,433 --> 00:39:19,222
Not to be misused.

362
00:39:20,889 --> 00:39:22,311
If breakfast isn't right,

363
00:39:22,336 --> 00:39:25,624
it's very hard for him to recover
for the rest of the day.

364
00:39:26,842 --> 00:39:28,217
I didn't know that.

365
00:39:28,403 --> 00:39:29,911
No, of course you didn't.

366
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:33,295
But you do now.

367
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,725
Still, I think he's too fussy.

368
00:39:43,365 --> 00:39:45,139
Well, that's as may be.

369
00:39:54,748 --> 00:39:56,233
This is...

370
00:39:56,282 --> 00:40:00,001
Flemish bobbin lace
from the late 1600s.

371
00:40:00,034 --> 00:40:02,830
It's very rare, very precious.

372
00:40:02,971 --> 00:40:05,995
<i>I rescued it from
Antwerp during the war.</i>

373
00:40:06,284 --> 00:40:08,682
I've been waiting for
the right moment to...

374
00:40:09,494 --> 00:40:11,354
<i>to make something with it.</i>

375
00:40:18,152 --> 00:40:19,207
Hold it.

376
00:40:19,496 --> 00:40:21,553
That's very nice.
That's beautiful.

377
00:40:21,655 --> 00:40:23,186
-Very nice.
-Best yet.

378
00:40:23,818 --> 00:40:24,745
Beautiful.

379
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:27,551
And, um, just look towards
the window, please, Alma.

380
00:40:28,203 --> 00:40:31,016
Amber, could-could you
just lift the bodice...

381
00:40:31,836 --> 00:40:32,891
a little bit.

382
00:40:33,281 --> 00:40:34,615
It keeps dropping down.

383
00:40:34,757 --> 00:40:36,749
We need to get that
adjusted properly.

384
00:40:36,828 --> 00:40:38,383
It's ridiculous.

385
00:40:39,138 --> 00:40:40,616
Just get it fixed.

386
00:40:40,653 --> 00:40:41,317
Yes, sir.

387
00:40:41,387 --> 00:40:43,191
It should've been ready today,
quite honestly.

388
00:40:43,262 --> 00:40:44,576
I don't understand why...

389
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,320
-I'm not sitting on the floor.
-Sit on the floor.

390
00:40:50,053 --> 00:40:51,733
Ah, that's great.

391
00:40:52,069 --> 00:40:53,202
That's great.

392
00:40:53,855 --> 00:40:55,152
Enough.

393
00:40:55,488 --> 00:40:57,019
Have I finished yet?

394
00:40:57,707 --> 00:40:59,113
All right, that's it.

395
00:40:59,224 --> 00:41:00,813
I need to do some work.

396
00:41:00,945 --> 00:41:01,922
Hell.

397
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:23,248
Yes?

398
00:41:25,026 --> 00:41:26,362
May I come in?

399
00:41:28,784 --> 00:41:30,089
I'm working.

400
00:41:34,121 --> 00:41:35,714
Do you need anything?

401
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:56,262
Just pull this over the shoulders.

402
00:41:56,334 --> 00:41:57,920
Show the dress...

403
00:41:58,287 --> 00:41:59,998
and put it on completely.

404
00:42:03,095 --> 00:42:04,378
Good, good, good.

405
00:42:04,758 --> 00:42:06,259
Alma...she ready?

406
00:42:06,307 --> 00:42:07,759
Me? wait.

407
00:42:09,992 --> 00:42:11,562
Come on, please.

408
00:42:35,574 --> 00:42:36,730
Ingrid?

409
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:40,137
Cape's wrong, let me do it.

410
00:42:40,715 --> 00:42:41,872
Let me do it.

411
00:43:14,431 --> 00:43:15,868
Ellie, ready?

412
00:43:15,955 --> 00:43:18,126
Let's have a look at you.
Stand here.

413
00:43:39,122 --> 00:43:40,262
All right.

414
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:44,589
Off you go, thank you.
Ingrid, you ready?

415
00:44:00,613 --> 00:44:01,964
Let me do it, let me do it.

416
00:44:07,816 --> 00:44:09,376
You're no good to me
just standing there.

417
00:44:09,587 --> 00:44:11,244
-I-I need your hands...
-Sorry, sir.

418
00:44:13,962 --> 00:44:15,603
Just go. Go, go!

419
00:44:16,595 --> 00:44:17,736
I'm sorry.

420
00:44:55,885 --> 00:44:57,433
Let me drive for you.

421
00:45:25,378 --> 00:45:26,667
<i>You see, when you...</i>

422
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:28,706
<i>when you love your work...</i>

423
00:45:29,276 --> 00:45:30,667
<i>and you can give</i>

424
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:32,456
<i>like he does...</i>

425
00:45:33,609 --> 00:45:34,711
<i>you need...</i>

426
00:45:34,882 --> 00:45:36,711
<i>to come down...</i>

427
00:45:37,409 --> 00:45:38,776
<i>again.</i>

428
00:45:41,015 --> 00:45:42,460
<i>And then, he's...</i>

429
00:45:43,195 --> 00:45:44,640
<i>he's a baby, he's...</i>

430
00:45:45,007 --> 00:45:46,773
like a spoiled little baby.

431
00:45:50,117 --> 00:45:51,804
When he's like this, he's...

432
00:45:52,702 --> 00:45:54,226
very tender.

433
00:45:54,679 --> 00:45:56,000
<i>Open.</i>

434
00:46:04,731 --> 00:46:06,621
How long would these
episodes last?

435
00:46:08,425 --> 00:46:09,989
Only a few days and...

436
00:46:10,379 --> 00:46:11,918
then he's well again.

437
00:46:30,927 --> 00:46:32,888
No, Alma, what are you doing?

438
00:46:33,208 --> 00:46:34,302
It's tea for you.

439
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:36,028
Don't put the tray on
the table, please.

440
00:46:36,154 --> 00:46:37,482
Just take it off.

441
00:46:37,576 --> 00:46:38,982
I didn't ask for tea.

442
00:46:39,704 --> 00:46:40,892
No, but...

443
00:46:41,767 --> 00:46:42,962
Take it out, please.

444
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,610
Yes, I can take it out.

445
00:46:45,817 --> 00:46:46,989
It's a bit late now, isn't it?

446
00:46:47,044 --> 00:46:48,535
I'm taking it out.

447
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:50,723
Yeah, but it's a bit
late now, isn't it?

448
00:46:50,947 --> 00:46:52,267
But I'm taking it out.

449
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:53,556
The tea is going out.

450
00:46:53,596 --> 00:46:56,485
The interruption is staying
right here with me.

451
00:47:15,547 --> 00:47:18,539
What if they
are yellow underneath

452
00:47:18,564 --> 00:47:20,063
and white on top?

453
00:47:22,262 --> 00:47:24,521
The poisoned ones have gills.

454
00:47:25,562 --> 00:47:27,137
Look at the book in the kitchen.

455
00:47:32,976 --> 00:47:34,410
We cook them in fat?

456
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:37,105
No, we'll cook them in butter.

457
00:47:37,898 --> 00:47:39,250
But not too much.

458
00:47:40,165 --> 00:47:43,055
Mr. Woodcock detests
too much butter.

459
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:36,741
There's a very good chance
Barbara Rose will ask you

460
00:48:36,766 --> 00:48:38,437
to attend her wedding.

461
00:48:45,096 --> 00:48:46,870
What do you want me
to do with that?

462
00:48:53,954 --> 00:48:55,696
Accept her invitation.

463
00:48:57,376 --> 00:48:58,649
You can stomach it.

464
00:49:03,099 --> 00:49:06,006
I really wish I hadn't heard
this till later on, Cyril.

465
00:49:06,702 --> 00:49:08,038
It's very unsettling.

466
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,353
Well...

467
00:49:13,595 --> 00:49:14,720
Chin up.

468
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,351
Barbara Rose pays
for this house.

469
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,018
All right?

470
00:49:43,723 --> 00:49:45,028
Morning, Barbara.

471
00:49:45,907 --> 00:49:48,453
Morning, Cal. Morning, Tippy.

472
00:49:48,625 --> 00:49:50,719
Morning, Mr. Woodcock.

473
00:49:55,282 --> 00:49:56,692
Reynolds.

474
00:49:59,091 --> 00:50:00,630
Let's get started.

475
00:50:22,759 --> 00:50:24,720
Just going to lift this up, Barbara.

476
00:50:34,913 --> 00:50:37,389
I know you're doing
the best you can.

477
00:50:39,808 --> 00:50:41,015
Don't do that.

478
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,608
-Take your hand away, please.
-I'm still so ugly.

479
00:50:43,689 --> 00:50:46,189
Barbara, I'm trying to make
you a beautiful dress.

480
00:50:49,432 --> 00:50:50,729
I need your help.

481
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:00,273
Oh, please.

482
00:51:12,157 --> 00:51:13,955
Reynolds, will you come?

483
00:51:14,158 --> 00:51:15,807
Stand still, please.

484
00:51:16,419 --> 00:51:18,801
It's really not my place, Barbara.

485
00:51:19,098 --> 00:51:20,621
This is what I do.

486
00:51:21,798 --> 00:51:23,837
This is my place here.

487
00:51:24,891 --> 00:51:27,142
I'm afraid I must insist

488
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:29,069
that you come.

489
00:51:38,339 --> 00:51:40,050
<i>George Riley, News of the World.</i>

490
00:51:40,282 --> 00:51:41,930
Who would be attendant
at the wedding?

491
00:51:41,985 --> 00:51:44,047
Oh, my son, Cal.

492
00:51:44,486 --> 00:51:45,510
My Cal.

493
00:51:45,557 --> 00:51:47,775
My son is so wonderful.

494
00:51:47,963 --> 00:51:51,010
He's so in favor of this marriage.

495
00:51:51,135 --> 00:51:52,580
John Evans, Daily Mail.

496
00:51:52,619 --> 00:51:54,565
And what of
your holdings, Ms. Rose?

497
00:51:54,709 --> 00:51:57,615
Do they become
Dominican property?

498
00:51:57,699 --> 00:51:58,706
Oh, I don't think so.

499
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:02,408
If I may say, we are being
married under Dominican law, but

500
00:52:03,035 --> 00:52:04,925
in my country,
her money belongs to her

501
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:06,544
and my money belongs to me.

502
00:52:06,728 --> 00:52:08,301
Anyway, why would
I need her money?

503
00:52:08,371 --> 00:52:09,704
I have enough of my own.

504
00:52:10,454 --> 00:52:12,087
What's Barbara brought
into your life?

505
00:52:12,874 --> 00:52:15,319
I brought sincerity into his life.

506
00:52:16,113 --> 00:52:17,773
-Sincerity?
-One kiss for the cameras.

507
00:52:17,828 --> 00:52:19,457
Go on, give us a kiss for
the camera, Ms. Rose.

508
00:52:19,551 --> 00:52:22,467
The answer to the question...
is sincerity.

509
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:23,515
Let's give them a
kiss for the cameras.

510
00:52:23,585 --> 00:52:26,632
Rubio, tell us about selling visas
to the Jews during the war.

511
00:52:27,994 --> 00:52:29,267
Visas to Jews?

512
00:52:29,595 --> 00:52:30,978
Thank you very much.

513
00:52:32,321 --> 00:52:33,363
Jews, visas?

514
00:53:34,366 --> 00:53:36,413
That dress doesn't belong here.

515
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:40,258
-Don't start crying.
-I'm not crying.

516
00:53:42,727 --> 00:53:43,894
I'm angry.

517
00:53:43,957 --> 00:53:46,317
-Don't start blubbering, Alma.
-I'm not blubbering.

518
00:53:50,885 --> 00:53:52,635
She doesn't deserve it.

519
00:53:54,182 --> 00:53:55,675
It's your work!

520
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:08,750
Come on.

521
00:54:13,312 --> 00:54:14,226
Tippy?

522
00:54:16,268 --> 00:54:17,252
Mr. Woodcock.

523
00:54:17,431 --> 00:54:19,142
-What is it?
-I would like the dress back.

524
00:54:19,338 --> 00:54:21,142
Ms. Rose is sleeping.

525
00:54:21,273 --> 00:54:22,681
Well, it's got nothing
to do with the dress.

526
00:54:22,751 --> 00:54:24,460
Can you go and
get it for me, please?

527
00:54:24,642 --> 00:54:26,064
She's sleeping.

528
00:54:28,254 --> 00:54:29,660
In the dress?

529
00:54:30,551 --> 00:54:32,082
Well, yes.

530
00:54:33,262 --> 00:54:37,512
Go and take the dress off her
and bring it to me right away.

531
00:54:38,328 --> 00:54:39,219
I don't think so.

532
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:41,274
Take the fucking
dress off Barbara

533
00:54:41,299 --> 00:54:43,001
and bring it to me
or I'll do it myself!

534
00:54:43,056 --> 00:54:44,642
I beg your pardon?

535
00:54:45,795 --> 00:54:47,045
Alma.

536
00:55:06,933 --> 00:55:07,745
Ah!

537
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:22,286
Ah!

538
00:55:23,614 --> 00:55:24,559
Oh.

539
00:55:25,841 --> 00:55:27,192
Hello, Mr. Woodcock.

540
00:55:27,465 --> 00:55:28,379
Cal.

541
00:55:35,695 --> 00:55:36,687
I...

542
00:55:36,891 --> 00:55:38,742
It's no business of ours...

543
00:55:39,017 --> 00:55:41,471
what Mrs. Rose decides
to do with her life.

544
00:55:41,883 --> 00:55:44,109
But she can no longer
behave like this...

545
00:55:44,192 --> 00:55:46,848
in a dress by the
House of Woodcock!

546
00:56:14,367 --> 00:56:15,378
Thank you.

547
00:56:21,101 --> 00:56:22,390
I love you.

548
00:56:30,798 --> 00:56:33,142
-At the gray, that's the mother.
-Gracie?

549
00:56:33,555 --> 00:56:36,274
Um, she can wear something
like that, but...

550
00:56:36,485 --> 00:56:38,167
-I'll introduce her to...
-It's Mona's day.

551
00:56:38,268 --> 00:56:38,940
Yes, it is.

552
00:56:38,995 --> 00:56:40,222
I'd like to make
something for her.

553
00:56:40,269 --> 00:56:41,217
Yes, of course.

554
00:56:41,295 --> 00:56:42,591
She mentioned that last time...

555
00:56:42,616 --> 00:56:44,835
-Did she? Did she really?
-Yeah.

556
00:56:45,178 --> 00:56:46,210
All right.

557
00:56:47,163 --> 00:56:48,710
-Julie?
-Yes, sir.

558
00:56:48,781 --> 00:56:50,328
-Do we have porridge?
-Yes, we do.

559
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:52,701
-Um, do we have cream?
-We do, yes.

560
00:56:52,763 --> 00:56:54,208
-Thick cream?
-Oh, yes.

561
00:56:54,258 --> 00:56:56,883
-That's what I'd like.
-Porridge's set.

562
00:56:57,031 --> 00:56:58,994
-Don't forget the salt.
-I shan't, I shan't.

563
00:56:59,064 --> 00:57:01,080
Oh, Alma, would you
like some porridge?

564
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:02,487
-Yes.
-This morning?

565
00:57:02,525 --> 00:57:04,908
-Some for Alma, as well.
-Right, you are.

566
00:57:05,036 --> 00:57:07,224
And um, bacon and eggs.

567
00:57:07,309 --> 00:57:08,515
All right, sir.

568
00:57:10,669 --> 00:57:11,739
Morning.

569
00:57:13,923 --> 00:57:15,400
I'm so hungry.

570
00:57:16,594 --> 00:57:18,564
Delighted that we have
cream in the house.

571
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:19,579
Yes.

572
00:57:19,689 --> 00:57:20,955
Makes all the difference.

573
00:57:21,492 --> 00:57:23,252
It's essential with porridge.

574
00:57:23,353 --> 00:57:24,986
A little bit naughty, though.

575
00:57:34,453 --> 00:57:35,562
Dear Reynolds.

576
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,062
Your Royal Highness.

577
00:57:37,141 --> 00:57:38,633
Happy...you're welcome.

578
00:57:42,086 --> 00:57:43,195
How nice to see you.

579
00:57:43,273 --> 00:57:44,286
Your Royal Highness.

580
00:57:44,344 --> 00:57:45,485
Cyril!

581
00:57:46,476 --> 00:57:48,341
Hello, how lovely to see you.

582
00:58:03,674 --> 00:58:04,752
S'il vous plaît.

583
00:58:09,703 --> 00:58:11,878
<i>When you dream about
your wedding dress,</i>

584
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:13,604
<i>what is it that you dream?</i>

585
00:58:14,523 --> 00:58:17,446
<i>I dream that it's the most
beautiful wedding dress</i>

586
00:58:17,548 --> 00:58:18,806
in the world.

587
00:58:20,009 --> 00:58:21,236
Naturally.

588
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:23,808
Perhaps the only wedding
dress in the world.

589
00:58:23,901 --> 00:58:25,135
Yes.

590
00:58:26,549 --> 00:58:29,510
Well, to take it just
a little step further,

591
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:33,783
perhaps the only wedding
dress that was ever made.

592
00:58:35,439 --> 00:58:36,485
Oui.

593
00:58:37,703 --> 00:58:40,968
Is Your Royal Highness a gold
person or a silver person?

594
00:58:41,803 --> 00:58:43,733
-Silver.
-Good.

595
00:58:44,065 --> 00:58:45,354
Lace or pearl?

596
00:58:45,659 --> 00:58:46,948
Lace.

597
00:58:48,402 --> 00:58:49,420
Very good.

598
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:50,621
Merci.

599
00:59:21,211 --> 00:59:23,805
I want to wish you...

600
00:59:24,742 --> 00:59:26,602
good fortune for your wedding.

601
00:59:27,247 --> 00:59:28,434
Thank you.

602
00:59:29,448 --> 00:59:31,255
Je m'appelle Alma.

603
00:59:33,372 --> 00:59:35,232
Lovely to meet you, Alma.

604
00:59:38,812 --> 00:59:40,391
I live here.

605
00:59:58,274 --> 00:59:59,532
Come in.

606
01:00:02,165 --> 01:00:03,173
Alma.

607
01:00:03,868 --> 01:00:05,158
Morning, Cyril.

608
01:00:07,688 --> 01:00:09,704
I wanted to ask your help.

609
01:00:10,032 --> 01:00:12,884
In a gift I wanted to
make for Reynolds.

610
01:00:16,609 --> 01:00:18,569
I want to make him a surprise.

611
01:00:20,374 --> 01:00:22,211
If everyone left...

612
01:00:22,867 --> 01:00:24,078
the house...

613
01:00:24,351 --> 01:00:27,327
when he takes his
walk on Thursday,

614
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,588
I will cook for him dinner.

615
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:33,800
And when he comes back,
no one will be there but me.

616
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:35,761
I'll be waiting for him.

617
01:00:36,443 --> 01:00:38,896
I will surprise him
and we can have dinner

618
01:00:39,005 --> 01:00:40,989
together, just the two of us.

619
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:44,114
Do you like this idea?

620
01:00:44,692 --> 01:00:46,059
Would you help me?

621
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:49,539
It isn't his birthday.

622
01:00:50,703 --> 01:00:51,914
I know.

623
01:00:53,203 --> 01:00:55,125
I would advise
against this, Alma.

624
01:00:55,608 --> 01:00:56,743
Why?

625
01:00:56,822 --> 01:00:58,219
Because he doesn't
like surprises.

626
01:00:58,336 --> 01:01:00,389
-He does.
-Well, he won't like this one.

627
01:01:02,476 --> 01:01:04,500
I'm trying to surprise him.

628
01:01:04,946 --> 01:01:07,352
And love him the way
that I want to.

629
01:01:10,554 --> 01:01:13,711
Well, if you're looking for
something kind...to do...

630
01:01:14,344 --> 01:01:16,703
perhaps, you could
think of something else.

631
01:01:17,187 --> 01:01:19,273
No, I really must advise
against this, Alma.

632
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:21,055
I don't think there
could be a more

633
01:01:21,149 --> 01:01:23,313
inappropriate time to
try something new.

634
01:01:23,445 --> 01:01:24,937
This is what I want to do.

635
01:01:25,453 --> 01:01:27,531
And I think
it will be very nice.

636
01:01:30,301 --> 01:01:32,589
With respect to your advice, Cyril...

637
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,913
but I have to know him
in my own way.

638
01:01:37,827 --> 01:01:40,046
And this is what
I want to do for him.

639
01:01:43,502 --> 01:01:44,502
Good night.

640
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:58,690
Good luck.

641
01:02:38,236 --> 01:02:39,674
Oh, Alma.

642
01:02:39,924 --> 01:02:41,127
What is this?

643
01:02:41,583 --> 01:02:43,247
I love you, Reynolds.

644
01:02:46,279 --> 01:02:48,287
Yes, but, what is this?

645
01:02:49,416 --> 01:02:50,948
It's a surprise.

646
01:02:52,353 --> 01:02:53,658
Are you hungry?

647
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:55,778
Where's Cyril?

648
01:02:57,129 --> 01:02:58,840
I've sent everyone home.

649
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:02,314
Where is Cyril?

650
01:03:04,103 --> 01:03:05,166
She's left.

651
01:03:05,367 --> 01:03:06,970
What time did she leave?

652
01:03:07,994 --> 01:03:09,423
This afternoon.

653
01:03:12,257 --> 01:03:13,968
I've made us dinner.

654
01:03:33,031 --> 01:03:35,812
Let me collect myself...
for a moment.

655
01:03:37,211 --> 01:03:38,914
I'll just have a bath, I think.

656
01:03:40,898 --> 01:03:42,742
This is very kind of you, Alma.

657
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:45,594
Would you like a champagne
or a martini?

658
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:46,899
No, thank you.

659
01:03:48,439 --> 01:03:50,431
Oh, is that your dress?

660
01:03:50,684 --> 01:03:53,216
It's finished?
Let's go look at it.

661
01:04:01,207 --> 01:04:02,082
Hm.

662
01:04:02,301 --> 01:04:03,926
It's rather interesting.

663
01:04:05,434 --> 01:04:06,738
Very good work.

664
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:08,934
I'll just have my bath now.

665
01:04:10,298 --> 01:04:11,900
When will Cyril get back?

666
01:04:12,213 --> 01:04:14,135
Mm, tonight.

667
01:04:49,479 --> 01:04:51,862
How was your appointment
with the princess?

668
01:04:56,854 --> 01:05:00,096
She's very beautiful like
a sculpture of some kind.

669
01:05:06,494 --> 01:05:07,698
Mm-hmm.

670
01:05:10,307 --> 01:05:13,503
So, will you make
her a wedding gown?

671
01:05:17,292 --> 01:05:19,456
I have made her baptism,

672
01:05:19,886 --> 01:05:23,488
her first communion,
and confirmation dresses.

673
01:05:24,061 --> 01:05:26,472
I made the dress for her
presentation at court,

674
01:05:26,497 --> 01:05:30,006
indeed, the entire wardrobe
for her coming out season.

675
01:05:31,043 --> 01:05:33,090
It's only right that I should
make her wedding dress,

676
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:34,754
wouldn't you think?

677
01:05:36,907 --> 01:05:39,040
No, but this is not...

678
01:05:39,610 --> 01:05:43,165
what I wanted to say, I'm-I'm sorry,
I don't know what I said, I...

679
01:05:43,765 --> 01:05:45,976
This is meant to be
nice evening.

680
01:05:47,742 --> 01:05:49,188
Let me serve you.

681
01:06:26,122 --> 01:06:27,450
Do you like it?

682
01:06:29,481 --> 01:06:30,630
I do.

683
01:06:34,075 --> 01:06:35,395
No, you don't.

684
01:06:36,715 --> 01:06:38,254
You don't like it at all.

685
01:06:38,826 --> 01:06:41,334
Usually, you always tell
me what you think.

686
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:43,678
What is this?

687
01:06:44,147 --> 01:06:45,467
You're lying.

688
01:06:51,425 --> 01:06:55,632
As I think you know, Alma,
I prefer my asparagus with

689
01:06:55,687 --> 01:06:57,374
oil and salt.

690
01:06:58,983 --> 01:07:00,186
And knowing this,

691
01:07:00,241 --> 01:07:02,911
you've prepared the
asparagus with butter.

692
01:07:03,064 --> 01:07:05,830
Now, I can imagine
in certain circumstances

693
01:07:05,916 --> 01:07:07,783
being able to pretend

694
01:07:07,877 --> 01:07:10,197
that I like it made this way.

695
01:07:12,284 --> 01:07:15,144
Right now, I'm just
admiring my own gallantry

696
01:07:15,247 --> 01:07:17,747
for eating it the way
you've prepared it.

697
01:07:19,489 --> 01:07:21,293
I don't know
what I'm doing here.

698
01:07:24,753 --> 01:07:27,300
I... I don't know
what I'm doing here.

699
01:07:27,652 --> 01:07:30,277
I'm just waiting around like a

700
01:07:30,442 --> 01:07:32,363
idiot for you.

701
01:07:34,238 --> 01:07:37,183
This was an ambush, Alma.
To what purpose?

702
01:07:37,644 --> 01:07:39,003
This is not...

703
01:07:39,635 --> 01:07:41,956
I know it's not going
as I expected, I...

704
01:07:42,019 --> 01:07:43,800
I didn't mean these
things to come out.

705
01:07:43,825 --> 01:07:45,371
I'm sorry, but
it was meant to be nice.

706
01:07:45,426 --> 01:07:46,957
Well, what <i>did</i> you expect?

707
01:07:47,004 --> 01:07:50,246
I wanted time with you.
I wanted to have you to myself.

708
01:07:50,362 --> 01:07:51,991
You have me all the time.

709
01:07:52,085 --> 01:07:53,491
-No!
-What are you talking about?

710
01:07:53,555 --> 01:07:55,218
I don't! I... there...

711
01:07:55,311 --> 01:07:57,093
There are always people around.

712
01:07:57,219 --> 01:07:59,750
And if not, then there's
something between us.

713
01:07:59,781 --> 01:08:00,717
Something between us?

714
01:08:00,751 --> 01:08:02,282
-Yes.
-What?

715
01:08:02,701 --> 01:08:04,037
Some...

716
01:08:04,857 --> 01:08:05,639
What?

717
01:08:05,664 --> 01:08:07,162
Distance!

718
01:08:09,055 --> 01:08:10,319
When did this happen?

719
01:08:10,452 --> 01:08:13,015
What happened to make
you behave like this?

720
01:08:14,796 --> 01:08:17,188
Is it because you think
I don't need you?

721
01:08:19,772 --> 01:08:20,403
Yes.

722
01:08:20,428 --> 01:08:21,671
I don't.

723
01:08:22,328 --> 01:08:24,155
Why, that's very
predictable of you.

724
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:26,151
Don't act so tough.

725
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:27,479
I know you are not.

726
01:08:27,722 --> 01:08:29,152
Yeah, that's right,
that's right.

727
01:08:29,225 --> 01:08:30,634
If I don't protect myself,

728
01:08:30,782 --> 01:08:32,270
somebody will come
in the middle of the night

729
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:34,197
and take over my
corner of the room

730
01:08:34,251 --> 01:08:36,639
and ask me about their
fucking asparagus.

731
01:08:36,702 --> 01:08:37,982
Don't be a bully.
You're being a bully.

732
01:08:38,062 --> 01:08:39,592
There are other things
I'd like to do with my time.

733
01:08:39,617 --> 01:08:41,687
-It's my time. My time!
-I have no idea what I'm...

734
01:08:41,712 --> 01:08:43,124
doing here in your time.

735
01:08:43,149 --> 01:08:44,266
What am I doing here?

736
01:08:44,328 --> 01:08:46,335
I'm standing around like
an idiot waiting for you.

737
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:47,359
Waiting for what?

738
01:08:47,384 --> 01:08:49,914
-Waiting for you.
-Waiting for what?

739
01:08:50,792 --> 01:08:53,339
Waiting for you
to get rid of me.

740
01:08:54,549 --> 01:08:56,111
To tell me to leave.

741
01:08:56,332 --> 01:08:58,012
So, tell me.

742
01:08:58,161 --> 01:09:00,192
So I don't stand around like a

743
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:01,345
fucking fool.

744
01:09:01,369 --> 01:09:03,346
Asparagus. Is this all
about your asparagus?

745
01:09:03,410 --> 01:09:04,571
No, it is not about asparagus.

746
01:09:04,634 --> 01:09:06,111
What the hell is it about?

747
01:09:06,213 --> 01:09:08,799
Are you a special agent sent
here to ruin my evening

748
01:09:08,824 --> 01:09:10,263
and possibly my entire life?

749
01:09:10,294 --> 01:09:11,504
Why are you so rude to me?

750
01:09:11,529 --> 01:09:12,951
Why are you talking
to me like this?

751
01:09:12,983 --> 01:09:13,989
Is this my house?

752
01:09:14,014 --> 01:09:15,551
-This is my house, isn't it?
-Yes, this is your house.

753
01:09:15,576 --> 01:09:17,044
-Is this my house?
-Of course, it's your house.

754
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:18,716
Or did somebody drop me

755
01:09:18,741 --> 01:09:19,891
-on foreign soil
-What a question.

756
01:09:19,916 --> 01:09:20,961
behind enemy lines.

757
01:09:20,986 --> 01:09:22,695
-You brought me here.
-I'm surrounded on all sides.

758
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:24,140
It's you who brought me here.

759
01:09:24,242 --> 01:09:26,148
When the hell did this happen?
Who are you?

760
01:09:26,211 --> 01:09:27,406
Do you have a gun?

761
01:09:27,703 --> 01:09:29,062
You're here to kill me?

762
01:09:29,757 --> 01:09:31,491
-Hm, do you have a gun?
-Stop it!

763
01:09:31,711 --> 01:09:32,921
-Where's your gun?
-Stop being a child.

764
01:09:33,054 --> 01:09:34,413
-Where's your gun?
-Stop...

765
01:09:34,625 --> 01:09:35,695
-Show me your gun.
-playing.

766
01:09:35,788 --> 01:09:37,570
Stop playing this game.

767
01:09:37,857 --> 01:09:38,990
-I'm not playing a game.
-I'm not...

768
01:09:39,053 --> 01:09:39,935
Yes, mm-hmm.

769
01:09:40,014 --> 01:09:41,419
-Uh-huh.
-What game am I playing?

770
01:09:41,521 --> 01:09:42,553
What game?

771
01:09:42,618 --> 01:09:44,915
What precisely is
the nature of my game?

772
01:09:44,991 --> 01:09:45,844
You tell me.

773
01:09:45,913 --> 01:09:47,431
Oh, this whole...

774
01:09:49,906 --> 01:09:50,697
What?

775
01:09:50,781 --> 01:09:52,984
All your rules and your walls

776
01:09:53,064 --> 01:09:54,640
and your doors and your people

777
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:55,687
and your

778
01:09:55,741 --> 01:09:58,237
money and all this clothes and

779
01:09:58,291 --> 01:10:00,752
everything! This! This!
This game!

780
01:10:00,806 --> 01:10:03,866
Everything here!
The whole pfff!

781
01:10:03,998 --> 01:10:06,920
Nothing is normal
or natural or...

782
01:10:07,116 --> 01:10:09,053
Everything is a game.

783
01:10:11,437 --> 01:10:12,984
"Yes, mister, no, madam".

784
01:10:13,039 --> 01:10:15,497
Yes, uh...vu-vu-poo.

785
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:16,826
Well...

786
01:10:16,982 --> 01:10:18,684
i-if it's my...
-I don't eat this.

787
01:10:18,732 --> 01:10:20,404
-If it's my life...
-I don't drink that, I don't...

788
01:10:20,443 --> 01:10:22,107
that you're describing.

789
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:25,043
It's entirely up to you whether
you choose to share it or not.

790
01:10:25,129 --> 01:10:26,584
If you don't wish
to share that life

791
01:10:26,609 --> 01:10:29,666
as apparently it's so disagreeable
to you in every respect,

792
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:32,556
why don't you just fuck off
to back where you came from?

793
01:10:53,577 --> 01:10:55,631
Sometimes it's good for him...

794
01:10:55,818 --> 01:10:57,897
to slow down his steps a little.

795
01:12:35,141 --> 01:12:37,461
Would you like me to
ask Alma to leave?

796
01:12:41,529 --> 01:12:43,154
No, why?

797
01:12:47,326 --> 01:12:49,568
Well, if you're going
to make her a ghost...

798
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,307
go ahead and do it, but

799
01:12:53,394 --> 01:12:55,808
please don't let her sit
around waiting for you.

800
01:12:56,878 --> 01:12:58,471
I'm very fond of her.

801
01:12:59,511 --> 01:13:01,489
Oh, you're very
fond of her, are you?

802
01:13:01,567 --> 01:13:03,301
Well, in that case...

803
01:13:08,487 --> 01:13:10,924
Well, don't turn it on me. I don't
want your cloud on my head.

804
01:13:10,949 --> 01:13:13,074
-Oh, shut up, Cyril.
-Oh, you can shut right up.

805
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:14,330
Don't pick a fight with me.

806
01:13:14,416 --> 01:13:16,465
You certainly won't
come out alive.

807
01:13:16,839 --> 01:13:17,691
I'll go right through you

808
01:13:17,762 --> 01:13:19,660
and it'd be you who
ends up on the floor.

809
01:13:19,707 --> 01:13:20,972
Understood?

810
01:14:26,455 --> 01:14:28,909
-Morning, Pippa.
-Morning, Sir.

811
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,542
Pen, book, and glasses?

812
01:14:36,604 --> 01:14:38,058
Yes, they're all
there for you, Sir.

813
01:14:38,643 --> 01:14:39,753
Morning, ladies.

814
01:14:39,877 --> 01:14:41,268
-Morning, Sir.
-Morning, Sir.

815
01:15:31,957 --> 01:15:34,575
Excellent work, ladies. Um...

816
01:15:41,044 --> 01:15:42,966
It's just not very good, is it?

817
01:15:45,744 --> 01:15:47,080
It's ugly.

818
01:15:55,581 --> 01:15:57,011
-Oh!
-Oh!

819
01:15:57,771 --> 01:15:59,146
You all right, Sir?

820
01:16:26,985 --> 01:16:28,297
Reynolds?

821
01:16:32,998 --> 01:16:34,435
Reynolds, are you all right?

822
01:16:38,499 --> 01:16:41,108
Mr. Woodcock,
he seems to be ill.

823
01:16:41,811 --> 01:16:42,967
Who seems to be ill?

824
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:46,211
Mr. Woodcock, he's fallen over
and he's damaged the dress!

825
01:16:47,569 --> 01:16:48,967
I-I'm sorry, Biddy?

826
01:16:49,142 --> 01:16:50,524
-Who's fallen over?
-Mr. Woodcock.

827
01:16:50,572 --> 01:16:52,705
He's fallen over and
he's damaged the dress,

828
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:54,998
and there's stains on
the front of the skirt,

829
01:16:55,054 --> 01:16:57,810
and there's a hole, in the bo-
in the lace and the bodice,

830
01:16:57,896 --> 01:17:00,668
and there's shoe polish
on the front of the dress.

831
01:17:01,387 --> 01:17:02,934
Shoe polish from what?

832
01:17:03,766 --> 01:17:05,118
From his shoe.

833
01:17:06,565 --> 01:17:07,651
I'm fine.

834
01:17:08,534 --> 01:17:10,542
Oh, I don't know what
the hell came over me.

835
01:17:13,452 --> 01:17:15,155
Must be something I've eaten.

836
01:17:15,193 --> 01:17:16,272
Mm-hmm.

837
01:17:29,315 --> 01:17:32,127
-You should lie down.
-No, I'm fine.

838
01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:35,359
Please lie down.

839
01:17:35,399 --> 01:17:37,311
No, really, don't fuss,
Alma, please?

840
01:17:37,336 --> 01:17:39,602
-I...
-Just don't fuss, whatever it is.

841
01:17:39,649 --> 01:17:42,540
If you fuss,
I'll die right here.

842
01:17:44,609 --> 01:17:46,452
I promise, I won't fuss.

843
01:17:52,070 --> 01:17:53,554
Let me do that, please.

844
01:17:53,601 --> 01:17:55,054
I have to take these off.

845
01:17:55,124 --> 01:17:56,968
Yes, I'll take them.

846
01:18:17,469 --> 01:18:18,414
Alma?

847
01:18:18,836 --> 01:18:19,799
Alma?

848
01:18:19,994 --> 01:18:20,884
Yes?

849
01:18:21,119 --> 01:18:22,010
Um...

850
01:18:22,783 --> 01:18:25,471
Would you tell them
I'll be down shortly?

851
01:18:28,174 --> 01:18:29,408
Yes, of course.

852
01:19:27,241 --> 01:19:28,772
Hello, Cyril.

853
01:19:29,061 --> 01:19:30,139
Yes.

854
01:19:32,375 --> 01:19:33,468
What is it?

855
01:19:34,968 --> 01:19:37,421
I don't know what the
bloody hell came over me.

856
01:19:37,684 --> 01:19:39,192
I'll be all right in a moment.

857
01:19:39,879 --> 01:19:41,473
Well, you don't look all right.

858
01:19:42,230 --> 01:19:43,598
Where does it hurt?

859
01:19:44,637 --> 01:19:46,262
It's all over.

860
01:19:47,051 --> 01:19:49,090
Never really felt like this before.

861
01:19:49,773 --> 01:19:51,727
Is it your stomach?
Is it something you've eaten?

862
01:19:51,814 --> 01:19:53,265
No, I don't think so.

863
01:19:53,297 --> 01:19:54,555
I swore, it...

864
01:19:55,366 --> 01:19:57,506
So please tell them I'll
be with them in a minute.

865
01:19:57,660 --> 01:19:58,937
No, you're not going anywhere.

866
01:19:59,093 --> 01:20:00,640
Just stay here and rest.

867
01:20:02,203 --> 01:20:03,758
Would you like me
to do anything?

868
01:20:05,062 --> 01:20:06,547
Just give me silence.

869
01:20:08,284 --> 01:20:09,547
Shall I call the doctor?

870
01:20:09,624 --> 01:20:11,570
No, Cyril, you certainly
will not, please.

871
01:20:11,665 --> 01:20:12,688
All right.

872
01:20:12,963 --> 01:20:13,791
Um...

873
01:20:14,089 --> 01:20:16,026
-Exhausted yourself.
-Just give me silence.

874
01:20:16,073 --> 01:20:17,182
Burning up.

875
01:20:17,237 --> 01:20:18,520
Will you take care
of the dress for me?

876
01:20:18,545 --> 01:20:20,229
Yes, of course I will.
It's all right.

877
01:20:20,362 --> 01:20:21,222
Just...

878
01:20:22,011 --> 01:20:24,925
-I just want to...
-Shh, shh, shh.

879
01:20:27,370 --> 01:20:28,400
That's it.

880
01:20:28,823 --> 01:20:29,948
Come on, Alma.

881
01:20:48,449 --> 01:20:50,253
I think I may be sick again.

882
01:20:55,641 --> 01:20:57,930
We're gonna have to do a lot
of work to get this dress

883
01:20:58,017 --> 01:20:59,759
ready for tomorrow, you know?

884
01:20:59,870 --> 01:21:02,174
We're gonna have to undo
the front of the dress,

885
01:21:02,244 --> 01:21:03,815
and replace the skirt.

886
01:21:03,932 --> 01:21:06,404
We're gonna have to cut a
new panel of the satin,

887
01:21:06,522 --> 01:21:08,041
and there's also the
organza piece...

888
01:21:08,136 --> 01:21:11,013
Yes, I'll deal with that in
a minute, Biddy, thank you.

889
01:21:52,347 --> 01:21:55,675
Yes, I've got to
change your pajamas.

890
01:22:03,269 --> 01:22:04,879
I'm scared, Alma.

891
01:22:08,137 --> 01:22:09,598
Yes, of course you are.

892
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:14,210
Do you think I'll ever get better?

893
01:22:14,678 --> 01:22:15,725
Of course.

894
01:22:17,061 --> 01:22:18,569
I take care of you.

895
01:22:26,987 --> 01:22:28,643
Madame, there's a telephone call.

896
01:22:47,585 --> 01:22:50,515
He's...settled now, sleeping.

897
01:22:51,437 --> 01:22:54,148
-Doctor's here.
-What doctor?

898
01:22:54,999 --> 01:22:56,421
The doctor I sent for.

899
01:22:56,767 --> 01:22:59,642
-Oh, no, but he's...
-He needs to be examined.

900
01:23:00,001 --> 01:23:01,845
-No.
-Yes.

901
01:23:02,864 --> 01:23:04,309
No, he's not dying.

902
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:06,239
He needs to be examined.

903
01:23:07,262 --> 01:23:09,120
He's sleeping now,
that's what he needs.

904
01:23:09,145 --> 01:23:10,512
Let me be unambiguous.

905
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:13,395
Come out of the room and
downstairs immediately.

906
01:23:15,324 --> 01:23:16,668
All right.

907
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:30,129
Alma, this is Dr. Hardy.

908
01:23:30,269 --> 01:23:31,769
How do you do,
Mrs. Woodcock?

909
01:23:32,821 --> 01:23:34,875
How do you do?

910
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:36,383
How's he feeling?

911
01:23:36,430 --> 01:23:38,899
He's-He's better,
he's sleeping.

912
01:23:39,055 --> 01:23:41,172
Is he able to keep
anything down yet?

913
01:23:41,274 --> 01:23:45,063
He hasn't tried it. Uh, I was
going to make some soup.

914
01:23:45,362 --> 01:23:46,744
And his fever?

915
01:23:47,104 --> 01:23:48,620
It has gone down.

916
01:23:50,151 --> 01:23:51,511
Oh, would you like
me to see him?

917
01:23:51,643 --> 01:23:52,745
Yes.

918
01:23:52,948 --> 01:23:54,167
Is that all right, Mrs. Woodcock?

919
01:23:54,237 --> 01:23:55,542
Yes! It is.

920
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:14,056
Reynolds, Lady Baltimore
sent her godson to see you.

921
01:24:14,276 --> 01:24:15,604
Dr. Hardy.

922
01:24:20,056 --> 01:24:21,603
Hello, Mr. Woodcock.

923
01:24:22,321 --> 01:24:23,657
May I examine you?

924
01:24:23,908 --> 01:24:25,455
Keep your hands off me.

925
01:24:26,290 --> 01:24:27,502
Well, I just like to
take your temperature.

926
01:24:27,527 --> 01:24:28,447
Alma?

927
01:24:28,556 --> 01:24:31,243
There's a strange boy in the room,
can you get him out, please?

928
01:24:31,377 --> 01:24:32,806
I admit, I do look young--

929
01:24:32,877 --> 01:24:34,228
Fuck off.

930
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:36,367
Reynolds, please, just
let him examine you.

931
01:24:36,437 --> 01:24:37,969
Yes, fuck off.

932
01:24:39,437 --> 01:24:42,015
I think this is clear, hm?

933
01:24:42,234 --> 01:24:43,812
He wants you to fuck off.

934
01:24:46,479 --> 01:24:48,229
I'm so sorry, Doctor.

935
01:25:02,578 --> 01:25:03,812
<i>I'm very sorry.</i>

936
01:25:04,039 --> 01:25:05,250
Not to worry.

937
01:25:05,416 --> 01:25:07,844
I'll drop by tomorrow morning
to see how he's coming along.

938
01:25:07,887 --> 01:25:08,879
Nine a.m.?

939
01:25:08,926 --> 01:25:09,957
-Yes.
-Yes.

940
01:25:09,982 --> 01:25:12,481
If his fever increases during
the night, you'll telephone me?

941
01:25:12,521 --> 01:25:13,902
-Of course, Doctor.
-Of course, Doctor.

942
01:25:14,067 --> 01:25:15,388
Good night, Mrs. Woodcock.

943
01:25:15,489 --> 01:25:17,099
-Good night, Doctor.
-Good night, Doctor.

944
01:25:30,103 --> 01:25:31,423
Follow me.

945
01:26:06,259 --> 01:26:07,580
When will it be ready?

946
01:26:08,329 --> 01:26:09,759
I don't know.

947
01:26:10,869 --> 01:26:12,220
Let me put it another way.

948
01:26:12,291 --> 01:26:14,234
This dress will be
ready by nine a.m.

949
01:26:14,259 --> 01:26:16,439
because that's when
it leaves for Belgium.

950
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:26,310
Ladies, I'm very sorry,
but I'm afraid

951
01:26:26,404 --> 01:26:28,239
you'll have to work
late this evening.

952
01:26:28,584 --> 01:26:31,232
The dress needs to be
ready by nine a.m...

953
01:26:32,232 --> 01:26:34,223
to make its journey to Belgium.

954
01:26:34,474 --> 01:26:36,193
Do expect to be here...

955
01:26:36,685 --> 01:26:38,310
for quite some time.

956
01:26:38,568 --> 01:26:40,201
If you need to use
the telephone,

957
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:41,883
please use the one in my office.

958
01:26:41,942 --> 01:26:44,954
Nana and Biddy,
what can I do to help?

959
01:26:45,052 --> 01:26:47,075
Could you pin the ribbon
on the hem there, please?

960
01:26:47,106 --> 01:26:48,138
Thank you.

961
01:26:48,208 --> 01:26:49,536
Ladies, I'm very sorry,
but I'm afraid

962
01:26:49,561 --> 01:26:51,341
you'll have to work
late this evening.

963
01:26:51,567 --> 01:26:53,522
The dress needs to be
ready by nine a.m...

964
01:26:53,547 --> 01:26:56,351
and I know there's rather
a lot to do on it, still.

965
01:26:56,429 --> 01:26:58,210
So, please, do expect
to be here...

966
01:26:58,262 --> 01:27:00,387
possibly for
the rest of the night.

967
01:27:00,457 --> 01:27:02,621
If you need to make
telephone calls,

968
01:27:02,646 --> 01:27:04,942
do so from my office.
Thank you.

969
01:28:32,444 --> 01:28:34,007
Are you here?

970
01:28:44,037 --> 01:28:45,826
Are you always here?

971
01:28:53,586 --> 01:28:54,843
I miss you.

972
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,359
I think about you all the time.

973
01:29:05,153 --> 01:29:08,387
I hear your voice say
my name when I dream.

974
01:29:10,230 --> 01:29:11,543
And when I wake up,

975
01:29:11,606 --> 01:29:14,270
there are tears
streaming down my face.

976
01:29:21,197 --> 01:29:24,119
I just miss you.
It's as simple as that.

977
01:29:27,205 --> 01:29:29,166
I want to tell you everything.

978
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:39,369
I don't understand
what you're saying.

979
01:29:43,963 --> 01:29:45,401
I can't hear your voice.

980
01:30:49,722 --> 01:30:51,363
Your fever's gone down.

981
01:32:38,263 --> 01:32:39,881
I love you, Alma.

982
01:32:42,365 --> 01:32:44,576
I don't ever want
to be without you.

983
01:32:50,175 --> 01:32:51,417
I love you.

984
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:57,197
I have things I want to do.

985
01:32:59,807 --> 01:33:02,182
I thought my days
were unlimited.

986
01:33:03,877 --> 01:33:05,408
The mistakes I've made...

987
01:33:06,142 --> 01:33:07,494
I've made again.

988
01:33:08,350 --> 01:33:10,061
They can no longer be ignored.

989
01:33:10,765 --> 01:33:11,981
There are things nagging at me.

990
01:33:12,090 --> 01:33:14,264
Things that now must be done.

991
01:33:17,449 --> 01:33:19,770
Things I simply cannot
do without you.

992
01:33:23,494 --> 01:33:24,962
To keep my...

993
01:33:30,110 --> 01:33:32,181
sour heart from choking.

994
01:33:38,573 --> 01:33:40,049
To break a curse.

995
01:33:43,457 --> 01:33:45,972
A house that doesn't
change is a dead house.

996
01:33:53,410 --> 01:33:55,191
Alma, will you marry me?

997
01:34:07,128 --> 01:34:08,519
Will you marry me?

998
01:34:18,917 --> 01:34:21,190
What the bloody hell
are you thinking about?

999
01:34:22,582 --> 01:34:24,050
Will you marry me?

1000
01:34:40,671 --> 01:34:41,819
No?

1001
01:34:44,250 --> 01:34:45,343
Yes.

1002
01:34:47,961 --> 01:34:49,438
Will you marry me?

1003
01:34:49,624 --> 01:34:50,913
Yes, I will.

1004
01:35:01,997 --> 01:35:03,179
Reynolds and Alma,

1005
01:35:03,242 --> 01:35:05,734
when you say these binding
and contracting words,

1006
01:35:05,832 --> 01:35:07,629
you'll be looking at each other

1007
01:35:07,668 --> 01:35:10,449
after all, it is to each other
you're marrying, and not to me.

1008
01:35:11,787 --> 01:35:13,162
Reynolds,

1009
01:35:13,358 --> 01:35:15,615
I call upon these
persons here present...

1010
01:35:16,301 --> 01:35:18,918
I call upon these
persons here present...

1011
01:35:19,019 --> 01:35:21,887
to witness that I, Reynolds
Jeremiah Woodcock,

1012
01:35:22,278 --> 01:35:26,266
to witness that I, Reynolds
Jeremiah Woodcock,

1013
01:35:26,352 --> 01:35:28,571
do take thee, Alma Elson,

1014
01:35:29,262 --> 01:35:31,926
do take thee, Alma Elson,

1015
01:35:32,122 --> 01:35:34,235
to be my lawful wedded wife.

1016
01:35:35,226 --> 01:35:37,484
to be my lawful wedded wife.

1017
01:35:37,973 --> 01:35:41,536
Alma, I call upon these
persons here present...

1018
01:35:42,007 --> 01:35:44,289
I call upon these
persons here present...

1019
01:35:44,781 --> 01:35:46,446
<i>to witness that I, Alma Elson,</i>

1020
01:35:46,742 --> 01:35:49,008
<i>to witness that I, Alma Elson,</i>

1021
01:35:49,190 --> 01:35:51,432
<i>do take thee, Reynolds
Jeremiah Woodcock,</i>

1022
01:35:51,925 --> 01:35:55,432
<i>do take thee, Reynolds
Jeremiah Woodcock,</i>

1023
01:35:55,589 --> 01:35:57,174
<i>to be my lawful wedded husband.</i>

1024
01:35:57,557 --> 01:35:59,885
<i>to be my lawful wedded husband.</i>

1025
01:36:02,019 --> 01:36:04,195
<i>And it now gives me great
pleasure to say...</i>

1026
01:36:04,367 --> 01:36:08,206
<i>Congratulations, you are now
 husband and wife.</i>

1027
01:36:08,466 --> 01:36:10,546
<i>And you may kiss the bride.</i>

1028
01:36:48,799 --> 01:36:50,198
Cuckoo.

1029
01:36:52,705 --> 01:36:54,174
-See you later.
-See you later.

1030
01:36:54,284 --> 01:36:55,503
Good time.

1031
01:36:55,866 --> 01:36:56,975
You too.

1032
01:36:58,312 --> 01:36:59,734
You too, have a good time.

1033
01:38:00,233 --> 01:38:01,686
None for me, thank you.

1034
01:38:08,014 --> 01:38:09,382
Dr. Hardy?

1035
01:38:10,484 --> 01:38:12,117
-Dr. Hardy?
-Oh, hey.

1036
01:38:12,178 --> 01:38:13,218
Oh, excuse me.

1037
01:38:13,335 --> 01:38:15,656
Reynolds, do you
remember Dr. Hardy?

1038
01:38:15,944 --> 01:38:17,827
Good evening,
Mr. and Mrs. Woodcock.

1039
01:38:17,976 --> 01:38:18,992
Oh, hello.

1040
01:38:19,070 --> 01:38:21,038
How do you do, Mr. Woodcock?
How are you feeling?

1041
01:38:21,117 --> 01:38:23,843
I think we met in a puddle
of sweat, didn't we?

1042
01:38:23,984 --> 01:38:25,038
Yes, that's right.

1043
01:38:25,148 --> 01:38:27,107
I probably owe you an
apology of some kind.

1044
01:38:27,146 --> 01:38:28,583
I seem to remember
barking at you.

1045
01:38:28,654 --> 01:38:31,326
There's no need. I've been
laid siege by much worse.

1046
01:38:31,524 --> 01:38:32,610
Oh, really?

1047
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,469
You look very healthy.
How are you feeling?

1048
01:38:35,992 --> 01:38:37,805
Didn’t I tell you to fuck off?

1049
01:38:39,031 --> 01:38:40,469
Yes, yes, you did.

1050
01:38:40,672 --> 01:38:42,922
Dinner is served, everybody.

1051
01:38:44,266 --> 01:38:45,453
Come on.

1052
01:38:48,078 --> 01:38:50,508
So that's your shifty-eyed godson.

1053
01:38:50,801 --> 01:38:52,278
Shifty-eyed?

1054
01:38:53,146 --> 01:38:54,826
He's got perfectly normal eyes.

1055
01:38:56,166 --> 01:38:58,339
I'm rather left smattering
things in that story.

1056
01:38:58,587 --> 01:38:59,572
Really?

1057
01:38:59,740 --> 01:39:01,349
Thank you very much.

1058
01:39:01,701 --> 01:39:03,138
It's fallen off me.

1059
01:39:03,394 --> 01:39:05,016
Ooh, I'm so sorry.

1060
01:39:05,095 --> 01:39:06,586
It's very hard
to tell sometimes.

1061
01:39:07,306 --> 01:39:08,329
Um...

1062
01:39:08,488 --> 01:39:10,254
Secrets nobody tells.

1063
01:39:11,774 --> 01:39:17,048
Your wife has got that gorgeous
glow you get with a first marriage.

1064
01:39:17,180 --> 01:39:18,813
How long will you be in for?

1065
01:39:19,603 --> 01:39:22,798
It seems my godson's rather
enjoying that glow as well.

1066
01:39:25,454 --> 01:39:27,587
So, what are your plans
for New Year's Eve?

1067
01:39:28,702 --> 01:39:30,202
Oh, um...

1068
01:39:30,616 --> 01:39:32,303
we don't have any.

1069
01:39:34,014 --> 01:39:36,428
Well, you should come out to the
Chelsea House Club ball.

1070
01:39:39,569 --> 01:39:40,889
I don't know what that is.

1071
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:41,810
Well, it's not
something I'd suggest

1072
01:39:41,850 --> 01:39:43,428
if I didn't think you'd
have a wonderful time.

1073
01:39:43,467 --> 01:39:45,194
It's really something to be seen.

1074
01:39:48,909 --> 01:39:50,925
I'll pass it on to my husband.

1075
01:39:51,417 --> 01:39:53,034
But I think we'll stay in.

1076
01:39:56,182 --> 01:39:57,651
Change your mind.

1077
01:39:58,995 --> 01:40:00,596
We'll get him to
change his mind.

1078
01:40:00,675 --> 01:40:02,323
Or whatever it takes.
Now, please come,

1079
01:40:02,417 --> 01:40:04,315
I promise you the
time of your life.

1080
01:40:08,284 --> 01:40:10,253
How do you know
how my life has been?

1081
01:40:12,792 --> 01:40:14,042
I don't.

1082
01:40:16,346 --> 01:40:17,479
You're right.

1083
01:40:18,378 --> 01:40:21,432
I think this would be quite a
fine time if you'd like to come.

1084
01:40:22,820 --> 01:40:25,656
She's barely looked at you
this evening, has she?

1085
01:40:35,434 --> 01:40:37,754
I think they're well
and truly shaken now.

1086
01:40:47,527 --> 01:40:49,262
What on Earth are you doing?

1087
01:40:49,474 --> 01:40:50,701
I rolled a three.

1088
01:40:50,826 --> 01:40:52,568
Yes, but that's the four pip.

1089
01:40:52,701 --> 01:40:54,067
Go back to the bar
where you belong.

1090
01:40:54,161 --> 01:40:55,576
Oh, sorry.

1091
01:40:56,539 --> 01:40:58,523
Let's not start cheating
at this stage, Alma.

1092
01:40:58,757 --> 01:41:00,687
I'm not cheating.
I don't need to cheat.

1093
01:41:00,851 --> 01:41:01,687
Oh, good.

1094
01:41:01,742 --> 01:41:04,296
You do need to be able to
count, on the other hand.

1095
01:41:04,555 --> 01:41:07,320
Backgammon, by the way,
I get trouble the score

1096
01:41:07,375 --> 01:41:09,890
because you haven't got any
checkers off the board.

1097
01:41:10,084 --> 01:41:11,412
Mm.

1098
01:41:11,826 --> 01:41:14,099
Pfff. Stupid game anyway.

1099
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:16,895
Well, maybe it seems stupid to you
now as you're currently losing,

1100
01:41:16,950 --> 01:41:19,442
but I dare say,
if you were victorious,

1101
01:41:19,552 --> 01:41:21,950
I'm confident that you'd see
it in a different light.

1102
01:41:21,997 --> 01:41:23,974
Now, they need your chair
for my next opponent.

1103
01:41:24,083 --> 01:41:25,138
Next.

1104
01:41:26,942 --> 01:41:28,099
Me, please.

1105
01:41:28,708 --> 01:41:29,802
What?

1106
01:41:29,981 --> 01:41:31,880
What are you so cranky about?

1107
01:41:32,891 --> 01:41:34,414
Have fun with your
next opponent.

1108
01:41:34,485 --> 01:41:37,328
Well, I-I think I will. A lot
more than I did with you.

1109
01:41:37,429 --> 01:41:40,867
Gosh, she's really
very rude, isn't she?

1110
01:41:42,910 --> 01:41:44,653
My heart breaks for you.

1111
01:41:44,755 --> 01:41:46,199
Oh, really?

1112
01:41:46,903 --> 01:41:49,051
Being married to a toddler.

1113
01:41:50,764 --> 01:41:53,100
I don't mean to be
racist, but, I mean...

1114
01:41:53,293 --> 01:41:55,417
Is there some sort of custom
at this time of the night

1115
01:41:55,480 --> 01:41:57,410
in her country where...

1116
01:41:57,577 --> 01:41:59,155
-I mean, what's she doing?
-What's your point?

1117
01:41:59,233 --> 01:42:00,218
I don't know...

1118
01:42:00,295 --> 01:42:03,686
She's stealing things or
attacking people, I mean...

1119
01:42:08,623 --> 01:42:10,147
I want to go dancing.

1120
01:42:13,700 --> 01:42:14,935
When?

1121
01:42:16,115 --> 01:42:17,294
Right now.

1122
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:22,233
You're joking.

1123
01:42:22,835 --> 01:42:24,131
No, I'm not.

1124
01:42:25,538 --> 01:42:27,053
It's New Year's Eve.

1125
01:42:32,030 --> 01:42:34,092
Well, I'm not going dancing.

1126
01:42:38,530 --> 01:42:40,678
There's a party at
the Devonshire Hall

1127
01:42:40,741 --> 01:42:42,530
to celebrate the New Year.

1128
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:45,046
And I want to go.

1129
01:42:48,538 --> 01:42:50,124
We need to go dancing.

1130
01:42:56,179 --> 01:42:58,170
So, what are you going
to do about it?

1131
01:43:01,976 --> 01:43:03,944
I'm going to stay right here

1132
01:43:04,030 --> 01:43:05,655
and I'm going to work.

1133
01:44:58,841 --> 01:45:00,724
And now, ladies and gentlemen!

1134
01:45:00,934 --> 01:45:05,372
Are you ready to welcome in
a glorious, lucky New Year?

1135
01:45:06,661 --> 01:45:08,090
Are you ready?

1136
01:45:08,902 --> 01:45:10,137
Here we go!

1137
01:45:10,442 --> 01:45:14,976
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

1138
01:45:15,139 --> 01:45:19,592
Five, four, three, two, one!

1139
01:45:19,726 --> 01:45:21,390
Happy New Year!

1140
01:47:21,215 --> 01:47:22,785
How does it feel?

1141
01:47:22,972 --> 01:47:26,332
Well, I think it feels a little big.

1142
01:47:26,739 --> 01:47:28,428
Should we just take
a little off the waist?

1143
01:47:28,593 --> 01:47:30,819
-We can take a little off the waist.
-Yes.

1144
01:47:47,358 --> 01:47:48,702
How's that feeling?

1145
01:47:49,069 --> 01:47:50,522
I think that's better.

1146
01:47:50,731 --> 01:47:53,723
Would you excuse me for a
minute please, Mrs. Vaughan?

1147
01:47:57,990 --> 01:47:59,576
I think it's...

1148
01:48:02,054 --> 01:48:03,687
It's not too tight?

1149
01:48:04,190 --> 01:48:06,487
No, it's comfortable. Fine.

1150
01:48:27,050 --> 01:48:29,261
Where has
Henrietta Harding been?

1151
01:48:41,142 --> 01:48:42,587
She's been to another house.

1152
01:48:42,711 --> 01:48:44,016
Which one?

1153
01:48:52,749 --> 01:48:54,116
Why didn't you tell me?

1154
01:48:54,280 --> 01:48:55,842
Because I didn't want to.

1155
01:49:02,674 --> 01:49:03,987
Is there something
that I'm unaware of?

1156
01:49:04,034 --> 01:49:05,737
Because as far as
I can remember,

1157
01:49:05,854 --> 01:49:08,261
all I have done is to
dress her beautifully.

1158
01:49:08,461 --> 01:49:11,024
I don't think that
matters to some people.

1159
01:49:12,274 --> 01:49:15,250
I think they want what
is fashionable and chic.

1160
01:49:15,703 --> 01:49:16,711
Chic?

1161
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:20,086
Oh, don't you start using that
filthy little word. Chic?

1162
01:49:20,456 --> 01:49:22,659
Whoever invented that ought
to be spanked in public.

1163
01:49:22,684 --> 01:49:25,128
I don't-I don't even know
what that word means.

1164
01:49:25,198 --> 01:49:27,073
What is that word? Fucking chic?

1165
01:49:27,415 --> 01:49:29,688
They should be hung, drawn
and quartered. Fucking chic.

1166
01:49:29,742 --> 01:49:30,969
It shouldn't concern you.

1167
01:49:31,001 --> 01:49:32,899
It does concern me. It
concerns me very much, Cyril

1168
01:49:32,945 --> 01:49:35,048
because it's hurt my feelings.

1169
01:49:35,368 --> 01:49:37,579
It's hurt my feelings.

1170
01:49:45,368 --> 01:49:47,454
So, what's all this
moaning about?

1171
01:49:50,490 --> 01:49:51,935
I am not moaning.

1172
01:49:52,693 --> 01:49:55,255
I do not like to be
turned away from.

1173
01:49:55,925 --> 01:49:57,159
Nobody does.

1174
01:49:58,425 --> 01:50:01,644
But I don't want to hear it
because it hurts my ears.

1175
01:50:20,388 --> 01:50:23,318
I've made a terrible mistake in
my life, Cyril. I've made a--

1176
01:50:25,491 --> 01:50:27,390
I made a terrible mistake.

1177
01:50:27,655 --> 01:50:29,116
I need you to help me.

1178
01:50:33,965 --> 01:50:35,691
What do you want me to do?

1179
01:50:44,648 --> 01:50:46,273
I can't work. I can't...

1180
01:50:47,015 --> 01:50:48,382
concentrate.

1181
01:50:49,460 --> 01:50:51,359
I have no confidence.

1182
01:50:52,573 --> 01:50:55,315
She does not fit in this house.

1183
01:50:57,581 --> 01:50:59,284
We built this house.

1184
01:50:59,464 --> 01:51:00,667
The two of us.

1185
01:51:00,799 --> 01:51:02,831
Now she's turning the whole
bloody place upside down.

1186
01:51:02,885 --> 01:51:04,419
She's turning me inside-out.

1187
01:51:04,607 --> 01:51:06,842
She's turning you and
me against each other.

1188
01:51:07,293 --> 01:51:11,310
Her arrival has cast a
very long shadow, Cyril.

1189
01:51:15,905 --> 01:51:18,272
Mrs. Vaughan is satisfied
with the dress.

1190
01:51:18,331 --> 01:51:20,643
No one gives a
tinker's fucking curse

1191
01:51:20,737 --> 01:51:23,416
about Mrs. Vaughan's
satisfaction!

1192
01:51:28,135 --> 01:51:29,510
Thank you, Alma.

1193
01:51:32,807 --> 01:51:34,057
Not at all.

1194
01:51:41,102 --> 01:51:43,962
What a model of
politeness you two are.

1195
01:51:51,016 --> 01:51:54,345
There is an air of
quiet death in this house.

1196
01:51:54,930 --> 01:51:57,508
And I do not like
the way it smells.

1197
01:55:49,909 --> 01:55:51,557
Would you like a glass of wine?

1198
01:55:51,971 --> 01:55:53,088
No, thank you.

1199
01:55:54,674 --> 01:55:56,401
Can I make you a martini?

1200
01:55:56,986 --> 01:55:58,737
Nothing for me, thanks.

1201
01:56:03,838 --> 01:56:05,198
Water?

1202
01:58:27,990 --> 01:58:29,170
I want you...

1203
01:58:29,849 --> 01:58:31,397
flat on your back...

1204
01:58:36,139 --> 01:58:37,131
helpless...

1205
01:58:39,014 --> 01:58:40,107
tender...

1206
01:58:42,185 --> 01:58:43,106
open...

1207
01:58:45,771 --> 01:58:47,372
with only me to help.

1208
01:58:54,007 --> 01:58:55,999
And then I want
you strong again.

1209
01:59:02,460 --> 01:59:03,976
You're not going to die.

1210
01:59:06,317 --> 01:59:09,871
You might wish you're going to
die, but you're not going to.

1211
01:59:14,174 --> 01:59:16,127
You need to settle
down a little.

1212
01:59:35,681 --> 01:59:38,681
Kiss me, my girl,
before I'm sick.

1213
02:00:00,505 --> 02:00:01,747
I think perhaps...

1214
02:00:02,825 --> 02:00:04,512
you should telephone that...

1215
02:00:04,990 --> 02:00:07,888
boy doctor of yours,
just in case.

1216
02:00:09,631 --> 02:00:11,037
You don't trust me?

1217
02:00:12,635 --> 02:00:14,846
No, I do trust you, it's just...

1218
02:00:22,474 --> 02:00:23,568
If you wish.

1219
02:00:24,764 --> 02:00:26,786
But I will make you well again.

1220
02:00:32,576 --> 02:00:33,717
I will.

1221
02:00:36,374 --> 02:00:37,717
I love you.

1222
02:00:38,350 --> 02:00:39,850
I love you, too.

1223
02:00:42,694 --> 02:00:45,272
And I think perhaps
you should leave the room.

1224
02:00:48,736 --> 02:00:51,111
-Close the door behind you.
-Yes.

1225
02:00:52,284 --> 02:00:53,659
I'll be right outside.

1226
02:00:58,851 --> 02:01:00,922
<i>If he didn't wake up from this,</i>

1227
02:01:02,711 --> 02:01:04,530
<i>if he wasn't here tomorrow...</i>

1228
02:01:05,984 --> 02:01:07,390
<i>no matter.</i>

1229
02:01:08,054 --> 02:01:10,273
For I know he'd be
waiting for me...

1230
02:01:10,789 --> 02:01:12,226
in the afterlife...

1231
02:01:13,250 --> 02:01:15,727
or some safe celestial place.

1232
02:01:17,260 --> 02:01:18,525
In this life...

1233
02:01:19,002 --> 02:01:20,392
and the next...

1234
02:01:20,666 --> 02:01:22,572
and the next one after.

1235
02:01:23,616 --> 02:01:27,374
<i>And for whatever there is on
the road that follows from here.</i>

1236
02:01:27,655 --> 02:01:30,194
<i>It would only require
my patience...</i>

1237
02:01:30,444 --> 02:01:32,093
<i>to get to him again.</i>

1238
02:01:33,686 --> 02:01:35,194
You see...

1239
02:01:35,631 --> 02:01:38,654
to be in love with him makes
life no great mystery.

1240
02:01:40,807 --> 02:01:42,737
-Say ah.
-Ah.

1241
02:01:48,633 --> 02:01:49,992
Very good.

1242
02:01:58,961 --> 02:02:02,039
<i>Sometimes I jump ahead
in our life together.</i>

1243
02:02:04,829 --> 02:02:07,477
<i>And I see a time near the end.</i>

1244
02:02:09,266 --> 02:02:12,704
<i>I can predict the future
and everything has settled.</i>

1245
02:02:13,625 --> 02:02:15,726
<i>And all our lovers and...</i>

1246
02:02:16,781 --> 02:02:19,836
<i>children and friends come back...</i>

1247
02:02:19,965 --> 02:02:21,926
<i>and are welcome.</i>

1248
02:02:22,874 --> 02:02:28,163
<i>And we have large gatherings
where everyone is laughing and...</i>

1249
02:02:28,797 --> 02:02:31,023
<i>playing games.</i>

1250
02:02:39,031 --> 02:02:42,046
<i>I am older and
I see things differently.</i>

1251
02:02:43,218 --> 02:02:45,640
<i>And I finally understand you.</i>

1252
02:02:51,357 --> 02:02:53,778
<i>And I take care
of your dresses.</i>

1253
02:02:55,466 --> 02:02:57,544
<i>Keeping them from dust and...</i>

1254
02:02:57,927 --> 02:03:00,200
<i>ghosts and time.</i>

1255
02:03:23,857 --> 02:03:26,450
Yes, but right now, we're here.

1256
02:03:28,023 --> 02:03:29,945
Yes, of course we are.

1257
02:03:33,533 --> 02:03:35,721
And I'm getting hungry.
