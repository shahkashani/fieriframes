The faces of angels destroyed.

3
00:00:40,421 --> 00:00:44,039
I saw a third
of Heaven's Legion banished

4
00:00:44,258 --> 00:00:46,714
and the creation of Hell.

5
00:00:48,971 --> 00:00:52,885
I stood with my brothers
and watched Lucifer fall.

6
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,139
But now my brothers
are not brothers.

7
00:01:00,983 --> 00:01:04,103
And we have come here,
where we are mortal,

8
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,859
to steal a dark soul
not yet Lucifer's to serve our cause.

9
00:01:13,453 --> 00:01:15,825
I have always obeyed.

10
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:23,210
But I never thought the war
would happen again.

(Bishop) Come to our help, Lord,
Holy Father, almighty and eternal God.

14
00:02:42,415 --> 00:02:44,871
You are the source
of every honor and dignity,

15

of all progress and stability.

16
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:51,497
You watch over the growing
family of man by Your gift of wisdom

17
00:02:51,716 --> 00:02:53,625
and Your pattern of order.

18
00:02:53,843 --> 00:02:56,844
When You had appointed
high priests to rule Your people,

19
00:02:57,054 --> 00:03:00,091
You chose other men
next to them in rank and dignity

20
00:03:00,308 --> 00:03:03,427
to be with them and to
help them in their task.

21
00:03:03,644 --> 00:03:06,182
And so there grew up
the ranks of priests...

22
00:03:06,397 --> 00:03:10,975
and the offices of Levites
established by sacred rites.

the great company of his people.

25

He shared among the sons of Aaron
the fullness of their father's power,

26

to provide worthy priests
in sufficient number

for the increasing rites
of sacrifice and worship.

Heaven shows them too much?

Years later, of all the gospels
I learned in seminary school,

49
00:06:10,201 --> 00:06:12,739
a verse from St. Paul stays with me.

50
00:06:12,954 --> 00:06:16,572
It is perhaps the strangest passage
in the Bible, in which he writes:

"Even now in Heaven there were
angels carrying savage weapons."

00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,507
Why don't we begin with his eyes?

162
00:19:21,974 --> 00:19:25,509
- Your man has none.
- What, they weren't in the radiator grill?

163
00:19:25,728 --> 00:19:27,721
No, I mean, he never had any.

164
00:19:27,939 --> 00:19:31,722
No optical fibers,
no muscle pores, zip.

165
00:19:31,942 --> 00:19:33,852
We did a toxicology on his blood,
you know,

166
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:35,943
looking for the usual:
coke, booze, sugar.

167
00:19:36,155 --> 00:19:37,483
What'd you come up with?

168
00:19:37,698 --> 00:19:39,572
High sodium, elevated erythrocytes,

169
00:19:39,783 --> 00:19:42,737
no floating cholesterol platelets,
trace ammonia.

170
00:19:42,953 --> 00:19:44,827
- What's so unusual about that?
- Oh, nothing. Nothing.

171
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,906
Actually, it's pretty common...
for an aborted fetus.

172
00:19:49,126 --> 00:19:51,284
- Fetus?
- We also did a bone section.

173
00:19:51,503 --> 00:19:54,255
It wasn't much trouble; most of them
were sticking out of his chest anyway.

174
00:19:54,464 --> 00:19:56,042
OK. And?

175
00:19:56,258 --> 00:19:57,586
When a baby grows,
their bones get larger

176
00:19:57,801 --> 00:20:01,252
by having calcium layers form
over the interior haversian canals.

177
00:20:01,471 --> 00:20:03,096
- Are you with me?
- I’m with you.

178
00:20:03,306 --> 00:20:08,015
This leaves growth rings; everybody's
got 'em. Except our pal here.

179
00:20:08,228 --> 00:20:10,600
Oh.
And this is for you.

180
00:20:10,814 --> 00:20:13,020
He's also a hermaphrodite.
Ohh!

181
00:20:13,233 --> 00:20:15,558
He's got both male
and female sex organs.

182
00:20:16,611 --> 00:20:18,354
- Think of the possibilities.
- Yeah.

183
00:20:18,571 --> 00:20:20,730
He could be impotent
and frigid at the same time.

184
00:20:20,949 --> 00:20:23,440
They don't normally work.

185
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,028
We found this in the lining of his coat.

186
00:20:28,331 --> 00:20:29,706

- Yeah.

Beautiful, really.

188

on his neck. Exactly the same.

189

That's attractive, huh?

190
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,928

- There's a velvet book marker.

There is no 23rd chapter.

195
00:21:02,281 --> 00:21:05,235
Well, maybe this
is the teacher's edition.

- Sign for it.

to keep it like that, if we can.

Mm-hmm. All right.

317
00:32:05,219 --> 00:32:09,632
Until I get back I want
everyone reading and being quiet.

318
00:32:15,897 --> 00:32:17,391
(Teacher) Mary?

319
00:32:20,401 --> 00:32:22,477
Mary?

320
00:32:32,997 --> 00:32:36,412
- Mary, come here.
- But Simon and I were...

321
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:38,452
Now.

322
00:32:39,253 --> 00:32:40,581
Ohh.

323
00:32:42,089 --> 00:32:45,173
I’m not mad at you. I just want
you to go back to class. OK?

324
00:32:45,384 --> 00:32:48,088
- Bye.
- Bye.

325
00:32:48,303 --> 00:32:50,592
This is school property.
You can't sleep here.

326
00:32:50,806 --> 00:32:53,760
It wasn't part of the plan.

327
00:32:58,021 --> 00:33:01,639
- Are you all right?
- Not really.

328
00:33:02,484 --> 00:33:04,311
I’ll have to call the police.

329
00:33:04,903 --> 00:33:08,354
(Sighs)
I wish you wouldn't do that.

330
00:33:10,033 --> 00:33:11,657
They can help you.

331
00:33:13,578 --> 00:33:17,196
No. Not me.

332
00:33:21,169 --> 00:33:23,208
Please leave, Katherine.

333
00:33:32,513 --> 00:33:34,506
(Mary) Hi.

334
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:39,550
Well, now. I thought you left.

335
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:42,688
I hid. I’m very clever.

336
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:44,606
Oh, yes, you are.

337
00:33:45,526 --> 00:33:47,068
Very clever.

338
00:33:49,822 --> 00:33:52,110
Mary...

339
00:33:53,617 --> 00:33:57,911
I have very little time left.

340
00:33:58,121 --> 00:34:01,455
And since you have been
so nice to me,

341
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:06,293
there's something that
I would very much like to give to you.

342
00:34:06,922 --> 00:34:08,250
What?

343
00:34:08,465 --> 00:34:11,585
Something very special.

344
00:34:13,553 --> 00:34:16,174
Can you keep a secret?

345
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:19,592
The biggest secret ever?

346
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,054
What is it?

347
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,763
Come here.

348
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:27,554
Come here.

349
00:34:29,193 --> 00:34:31,649
It’s OK. Come here.

350
00:34:42,456 --> 00:34:45,208
You're a very clever girl.

351
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:50,084

Oh, honey.

356
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:22,370
- Are you OK?
- I don't feel good.

357
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:25,449
Did you...
Did you eat something?

358
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,743
Can I go home now?

359
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,084
Come on.

360
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,051
It’s OK.

00:35:57,446 --> 00:36:00,233
Mary got really sick in school
and I thought she should come home.

363
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:02,821
I don't feel very good, Grandma.

364

Come on, sweetie.

(Whispers)
It’s all right.

366
00:36:09,249 --> 00:36:12,784
I’ll have the school
send for a doctor.

a tanker spill and they may be a while.

These people are rarely any problem.

371
00:36:23,889 --> 00:36:25,846
I'll have one of the boys come
down by tonight or tomorrow

372
00:36:26,057 --> 00:36:27,468
and chew him out for ya.

373
00:36:27,684 --> 00:36:31,053
All right.
I mean, as soon as you can.

374
00:36:31,271 --> 00:36:35,482
He was kind of strange.
All right, thanks.

snow angels we used to make as kids.

don't you?

the outside that matters.

It’s what's on the inside.
Oooh!

want to kill yourself.

Oh, no, I did, actually.

When was it
that you lost your grace?

I’d like to help you,
old friend, but I can't.

who's wrong, but it doesn't matter.

have to do what you're told.

about a conversation like this?

Yeah. I wanted to know
what he was doing there.

- Did he say?
- No, he didn't say.

- Yes.
- Which one?

Did you know an Arnold Hawthorne?

- The colonel.
- Did you go to his funeral?

- Everybody did. He lived here.
- Any dark secrets?

Sure.

557
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:01,238
No, not really.
I mean, he lived here,

558
00:51:01,454 --> 00:51:04,075
but nobody ever really
talked to him much.

559
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:06,081
- Have any family?
- Nah, not Hawthorne.

560

Town'll probably just
auction this place.

561

- Yeah.
- Well, lock up when you're done.

562
00:51:11,547 --> 00:51:14,667

- Sure.

looking for... Thomas?

then I put my finger there...

575

and I said, "Shh."

- Sandra.
- How'd you know my name?

587
00:57:09,939 --> 00:57:13,557
Well, you look like a Sandra.
You have very pretty teeth, Sandra.

- Let's check 'em. Hmm? Ahh.

589
00:57:20,991 --> 00:57:23,826
- Did you see the man upstairs, Sandra?
- A little.

590
00:57:24,036 --> 00:57:26,159
- Did you talk to him?
- No.

591
00:57:26,371 --> 00:57:28,280

- Ignore him.
- Yeah, everybody else does.

604

Look, I don't know what's going on
here, but I think you both should leave.

You're right.

00:58:15,085 --> 00:58:18,454
You have no idea what's going on.

607
00:58:41,486 --> 00:58:44,570
So you saw Simon.
What did he say to you?

608
00:58:47,701 --> 00:58:50,026
You weren't supposed to be here.

609
00:58:50,245 --> 00:58:53,448
- Why? Is something wrong?
- Emma. It’s OK, Mary.

610
00:58:53,665 --> 00:58:55,990
You don't have to talk to him.
You don't have to talk to any of them.

611
00:58:56,543 --> 00:58:59,294
He was just asking me about Simon.

612
00:58:59,504 --> 00:59:01,413
Simon?

613
00:59:01,631 --> 00:59:04,798
- What did he say to you, Mary?
- He asked if I could keep a secret.

614
00:59:05,009 --> 00:59:09,007
- What was that?
- Something he gave me.

615
00:59:09,806 --> 00:59:13,803
- What did he give you?
- Then it wouldn't be a secret.

616
00:59:14,018 --> 00:59:16,509
You're a good friend not to tell, Mary.
But I’m a good friend of Simon's too.

617
00:59:16,729 --> 00:59:20,727
So if you want to go ahead and say
what it was, you can to me, OK?

618
00:59:21,358 --> 00:59:23,481
It’s a secret.

619
00:59:24,695 --> 00:59:27,649
But sometimes it hurts.

620
00:59:30,117 --> 00:59:32,525
Ever cut off a Chinaman's head?

621
00:59:33,787 --> 00:59:40,620
They don't bleed. Not like we do.
Or maybe it was just the cold.

622
00:59:41,545 --> 00:59:44,166
You could always tell
when they were coming.

623
00:59:45,215 --> 00:59:47,421
Those songs.

624
00:59:48,635 --> 00:59:52,964
They'd charge through the snow.
Their guns froze.

625
00:59:53,974 --> 00:59:56,975
And that was OK
because we were better.

626
00:59:57,978 --> 01:00:00,350
Colder.

627
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:04,182
At Chosin,
we were colder than anyone.

628
01:00:06,111 --> 01:00:08,103
Make it stop, Miss Henley!
Make it stop!

629
01:00:08,321 --> 01:00:12,235
- It’s OK. It’s OK.
- Make it stop! Make it stop!

630
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:15,119
Shh.

631
01:00:15,328 --> 01:00:17,119
What are we gonna do?

632
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:21,279
She's going to have the enemy
ghost way. We leave this afternoon.

633
01:00:21,501 --> 01:00:25,450
- Wh... Where's the ceremony?
- It’s at her clan's village.

634
01:00:25,671 --> 01:00:27,628
- Old Woman Butte.
- You're gonna take her away?

635
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:32,217
- This girl needs a doctor.
- She's already seen a doctor.

636
01:00:36,348 --> 01:00:41,473
Chinamen's heads? Chosin? I’ve never
heard her talk that way before.

637
01:00:42,021 --> 01:00:43,812
Is someone teaching that
to your kids in class?

638
01:00:44,023 --> 01:00:47,107
Yeah, sure.
Right next to Jack and Jill.

639
01:00:48,485 --> 01:00:51,688
Colonel Hawthorne was at Chosin.
Did she talk to him?

640
01:00:51,905 --> 01:00:54,657
She had no contact with him.
He hated children.

641
01:00:56,618 --> 01:01:01,245
This isn't just about some drunk who
burned himself up at the school, is it?

642
01:01:03,333 --> 01:01:05,242
Can you tell me the truth, Thomas?

643
01:01:07,379 --> 01:01:09,418
Did you ever read
the Bible, Katherine?

644
01:01:10,006 --> 01:01:11,666
Long time ago.

645
01:01:12,425 --> 01:01:17,134
Ever notice how in the Bible, whenever
God needed to punish someone

646
01:01:17,347 --> 01:01:19,304
or make an example,

647
01:01:19,516 --> 01:01:24,224
or whenever God needed a killing,
He sent an angel?

648
01:01:25,646 --> 01:01:29,561
Did you ever wonder what
a creature like that must be like?

649
01:01:30,443 --> 01:01:32,435
A whole existence spent
praising your God,

650
01:01:32,653 --> 01:01:34,895
but always with one wing
dipped in blood.

651
01:01:36,324 --> 01:01:40,985
Would you ever really
want to see an angel?

652
01:01:41,996 --> 01:01:45,162
- Why are you asking me this?
- They want Colonel Hawthorne.

653
01:01:46,834 --> 01:01:50,285
They want a dead,
forgotten, psychotic colonel.

654
01:01:50,713 --> 01:01:52,041
They?

655
01:01:57,594 --> 01:02:00,132
There was a man
at my school this morning.

656
01:02:00,347 --> 01:02:03,467
The children were calling him Gabriel.

657
01:02:03,684 --> 01:02:06,175
He had Sandra on his lap.

658
01:02:07,604 --> 01:02:09,976
What does he want with my kids?

659
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:12,562
I don't know, Katherine.

660
01:02:14,694 --> 01:02:17,066
But I gotta find him.

661
01:02:17,906 --> 01:02:19,898
I know where you can find him.

662
01:02:30,251 --> 01:02:32,208
He was parked right here.

663
01:02:57,069 --> 01:02:58,860
It’s cold.

664
01:03:21,927 --> 01:03:24,133
What's that?

665
01:03:24,346 --> 01:03:25,804
I don't know.

666
01:03:59,088 --> 01:04:01,294
(Thomas) It’s angelic script.

667
01:04:26,657 --> 01:04:28,448
Thomas?

668
01:04:34,623 --> 01:04:36,496
(Shrieking)

669
01:04:38,376 --> 01:04:40,084

No!
(Katherine Gasps)

674
01:05:23,671 --> 01:05:27,751
Saint John was right.
There's a war in Heaven.

675
01:05:29,134 --> 01:05:30,926
Is Gabriel an angel?

676
01:05:33,055 --> 01:05:35,628
He wants something.

677
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:37,806
Something that's here.

678
01:05:38,977 --> 01:05:40,519
He wants Mary.

679
01:05:44,566 --> 01:05:47,057
Thomas, he wants Mary.

680
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:51,941
Mary?

681
01:05:52,157 --> 01:05:54,149
His car.

682
01:05:58,037 --> 01:05:59,615
- Get away from her.
- Son of a gun.

683
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:02,324
Priest. Wannabe. Figured it out.

684
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:04,831
- Mary?
- Shh.

685
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:07,998
She won't feel anything, honest.
I have to rip her apart, of course.

686
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:13,006
It’s just the way it goes. See, Simon hid
Hawthorne's soul inside her. I need it.

687
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:16,298
Nice Catholic boy like you,
Mr Dagget, should be on my side.

688
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:18,259
Goddamn it!

689
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:20,716
You're gonna
have to watch it with that profanity.

690
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:24,138
- (Yelling)
- Mary.

691

693
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:33,148
(Thomas) Come on, motherfucker!

694
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:34,774
Come on, fuck!

695
01:06:40,621 --> 01:06:42,779
Thanks, man. You're a sport.

696
01:06:48,837 --> 01:06:53,546
Pest! You have any idea how
hard it is to get one of those?

697
01:06:58,388 --> 01:06:59,716
Why?

698
01:06:59,931 --> 01:07:02,802
I’m an angel. I kill firstborns
while their mamas watch.

699
01:07:03,518 --> 01:07:05,511
I turn cities into salt.

700
01:07:05,729 --> 01:07:08,932
I even, when I feel like it,
rip the souls from little girls.

701
01:07:09,149 --> 01:07:11,390
And from now till kingdom come,

the only thing you
can count on, in your existence,

- (Gasps)
- You, give me a kiss.

705

- (Thomas) Go! Go!

707
01:07:47,478 --> 01:07:50,811
can't... have her!

(Katherine) Thomas!

709
01:08:14,796 --> 01:08:18,379
(Man) Get that one and a half
inches over to the other side.

710
01:08:20,301 --> 01:08:22,210
We need more!

711
01:08:23,638 --> 01:08:26,805
You don't understand.
You gotta cuff him.

712
01:08:27,016 --> 01:08:28,973
- He's dead.
- He's not dead.

713
01:08:29,185 --> 01:08:31,178
- Cuff him, do you hear me?
- Bob, just do it.

714
01:08:31,395 --> 01:08:33,851
Do it!

715
01:08:34,065 --> 01:08:37,101
All right, Jack. Cuff him.
Put him in my car.

716
01:08:37,318 --> 01:08:39,773
- All right.
- They got him. They got him.

On Earth, they're not immortal.

720

They're not like you and me.
You've got to cut their hearts out.

721

Come on.

- No, Katherine.

because they hate you.

You and all humans.

God has put you in His grace and
pushed them aside. They're desperate.

and has found a way to steal the
blackest soul on Earth to fight for him.

792
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:14,902
If he wins, Heaven opens.

793
01:17:18,994 --> 01:17:21,699
I know that this new Heaven
will just be another Hell.

794
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,827
You see, I’m not here
to help you and the little bitch

795
01:17:26,042 --> 01:17:27,834
because I love you
or because I care for you,

796
01:17:28,044 --> 01:17:30,535
but because two Hells
is one Hell too many

797
01:17:30,755 --> 01:17:32,415
and I can't have that.

798
01:17:33,842 --> 01:17:38,302
What I’m offering you is a chance
not only to save Mary,

799
01:17:38,513 --> 01:17:42,463
but to finally open
Heaven to your kind.

800
01:17:43,851 --> 01:17:45,761
What do you say?

801
01:17:49,148 --> 01:17:51,057
(Crickets Chirping)

802
01:18:02,787 --> 01:18:05,574
I saw the devil tonight.

803
01:18:16,467 --> 01:18:18,922
If you have something to say...

804
01:18:21,638 --> 01:18:23,880
why can't you say it to me?

805
01:18:29,688 --> 01:18:31,016
Thomas.

806
01:18:39,197 --> 01:18:41,984
I had a voice once, Katherine.

807
01:18:45,203 --> 01:18:47,694
For as long as I could remember,

808
01:18:47,914 --> 01:18:54,035
I had a voice that called me to my
God, that called me to church.

809
01:18:54,712 --> 01:18:57,832
And on the day that I needed
that voice the most,

810
01:19:00,551 --> 01:19:02,259
it left me.

811
01:19:03,846 --> 01:19:07,013
It’s better never
having known that voice.

812
01:19:09,977 --> 01:19:15,316
All I know is that I’m not going to let
anything happen to Mary. All right?

813
01:19:40,215 --> 01:19:44,877
Say, ma'am, any idea where
I can find Old Woman Butte?

814
01:19:45,095 --> 01:19:46,755
Yeah, it's on the reservation.

815
01:19:47,222 --> 01:19:50,638
Don't suppose you could be
just a tad more specific,

816
01:19:50,850 --> 01:19:52,594
Madge?

817
01:19:55,105 --> 01:19:59,185
The light. It was so...

818
01:19:59,901 --> 01:20:02,226
br... bright.

819
01:20:04,447 --> 01:20:07,020
- Isn't your friend hungry?
- What?

820
01:20:08,451 --> 01:20:11,701
Not for a while, I’m afraid.
Funniest thing.

821
01:20:13,831 --> 01:20:15,373
Don't do that.

822
01:20:15,583 --> 01:20:17,991
Take the 522
to the Sonsela Wash cutoff.

823
01:20:18,211 --> 01:20:21,414
- Right.
- First dirt road, go left 20, 25 miles.

824
01:20:21,631 --> 01:20:23,956
- You'll see it.
- Much obliged.

825
01:20:24,175 --> 01:20:27,129
- Let's get crackin', Rachael.
- No!

826
01:20:30,055 --> 01:20:37,221
Eternity here. In that sagging skin suit.
Or one more day with me.

827
01:20:38,313 --> 01:20:43,770
- Why?
- Can't drive. But I can wait.

828
01:20:45,237 --> 01:20:49,317
Until the stars burn out,
if you don't make up your mind.

829
01:20:55,872 --> 01:20:58,244
- I doubt we'll meet again.
- Suits me.

830
01:20:58,458 --> 01:21:00,367
Thank Heaven.

831
01:21:18,061 --> 01:21:20,219
Little Tommy Dagget.

832
01:21:20,438 --> 01:21:24,601
How I loved listening
to your sweet prayers every night.

833
01:21:24,817 --> 01:21:30,855
And then you'd jump in your bed,
so afraid I was under there. And I was.

834
01:21:34,702 --> 01:21:37,572
Do you know what Hell
really is, Thomas?

835
01:21:37,788 --> 01:21:41,074
It’s not lakes of burning oil
or chains of ice.

836
01:21:41,292 --> 01:21:43,747
It’s being removed from God's sight,

837
01:21:43,961 --> 01:21:46,286
having His Word taken from you.

838
01:21:46,505 --> 01:21:51,879
- (Panting)
- It’s hard to believe. So hard.

839
01:21:53,178 --> 01:21:56,179
I know that better than anyone.

840
01:21:56,390 --> 01:21:58,881
And there's your weapon.

841
01:22:00,978 --> 01:22:04,228
Think, Thomas, think.

842
01:22:04,439 --> 01:22:07,310
What is the one thing
essential to an angel,

843
01:22:07,526 --> 01:22:10,610
the thing that holds
his entire being together?

844
01:22:10,820 --> 01:22:12,778
Faith. Faith, faith.

845
01:22:12,989 --> 01:22:16,192
And what would happen
if that faith was tested,

846
01:22:16,409 --> 01:22:22,245
and an angel, just like you,
didn't understand?

847
01:22:24,667 --> 01:22:26,790
Use that.

848
01:22:27,295 --> 01:22:29,169
Use it!

849
01:23:31,191 --> 01:23:33,479
He's coming.

850
01:23:40,241 --> 01:23:42,364
(Chanting)

851
01:24:00,511 --> 01:24:03,512
Go inside, lock the door.

852
01:24:03,764 --> 01:24:07,513
There's one shot. OK?

853
01:24:13,148 --> 01:24:15,105
It’ll be OK.

854
01:24:41,384 --> 01:24:45,334
You're gonna love it, Rachael.
It’ll be our night to howl.

855
01:24:58,109 --> 01:25:00,860
Nice move. Beautifully done.

856
01:25:01,070 --> 01:25:03,478
Tommy, you've got to
come work for me.

857
01:25:03,698 --> 01:25:06,615
Upstairs.
I... I could get you in now.

858
01:25:06,826 --> 01:25:09,447
You'll love it.
Nobody tells you when to go to bed.

859
01:25:09,662 --> 01:25:11,738
You eat all the ice cream you want.

860
01:25:11,956 --> 01:25:17,163
You get to kill all day,
all night, just like an angel!

861
01:25:17,378 --> 01:25:20,082
Save yourself, friend!

862
01:25:20,297 --> 01:25:24,046
Why go to the wall
for that bitch and her rug rat?

863
01:25:24,259 --> 01:25:26,584
It all turns out the same
anyway. Now, later.

864
01:25:26,803 --> 01:25:29,010
I’m gonna rip that kid apart.

865
01:25:29,222 --> 01:25:32,638
I’m not an angel! I’m just a man.

866
01:25:32,851 --> 01:25:36,101
Which means I got something
you don't. It’s a soul.

867
01:25:40,275 --> 01:25:41,603
This is gonna really hurt.

868
01:25:42,235 --> 01:25:43,610
Your war...

869
01:25:44,571 --> 01:25:46,777
- Make it good.
- Your war is a lie!

870
01:25:47,949 --> 01:25:51,400
- Right.
- It’s not about humans. It’s about God.

871
01:25:51,619 --> 01:25:53,493
What do you know
about that, you monkey?

872
01:25:53,705 --> 01:25:56,540
I don't have to, Gabriel.
I know you.

873
01:25:56,749 --> 01:26:00,367
I know what it's like
to be ignored, pushed aside.

874
01:26:00,586 --> 01:26:02,793
I know your anger, Gabriel.

875
01:26:03,297 --> 01:26:07,509
I know what it's like
to lose your faith in the Word. I know.

876
01:26:08,427 --> 01:26:12,092
'Cause you hate Him.
You hate Him just a little bit.

877
01:26:12,848 --> 01:26:14,924
'Cause you're jealous.

878
01:26:15,476 --> 01:26:18,596
That's what this war's about...
jealousy.

879
01:26:19,271 --> 01:26:22,854
Jealousy that He could love
something more than you.

880
01:26:23,275 --> 01:26:25,766
Something with a soul.

881
01:26:27,655 --> 01:26:29,446
Well.

882
01:26:29,656 --> 01:26:34,365
If you wanted to prove
your side was right, Gabriel, so badly,

883
01:26:35,037 --> 01:26:37,160
why didn't you just ask Him?

884
01:26:37,372 --> 01:26:38,914
Why didn't you just ask God?

885
01:26:43,003 --> 01:26:44,497
Because...

886
01:26:46,173 --> 01:26:49,339
He doesn't talk to me any more.

887
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:06,728
(Sniffing)

888
01:27:07,151 --> 01:27:08,480
(Chanting)

889
01:27:17,161 --> 01:27:19,118
Gabriel!

890
01:27:33,385 --> 01:27:35,841
- I’m getting so fed up with you.
- Go to hell.

891
01:27:36,055 --> 01:27:39,340
Heaven, darling, Heaven.
At least get the zip code right.

892
01:27:39,558 --> 01:27:43,390
- It’s all the same to you, isn't it?
- No. In Heaven, we believe in love.

893
01:27:43,937 --> 01:27:47,223
- What do you love, Gabriel?
- Cracking your skull.

894
01:27:47,441 --> 01:27:49,766
(Grunting)

895
01:27:49,985 --> 01:27:52,855
- (Thomas Screaming)
- Kill me!

896
01:27:53,071 --> 01:27:54,980
(Grunting)

897
01:28:03,873 --> 01:28:06,364
Oh, God!
(Grunting)

898
01:28:09,629 --> 01:28:11,669
Mary!

899
01:28:19,597 --> 01:28:21,756
- Go home.
- (Growls)

900
01:28:23,309 --> 01:28:25,052
Go home!

901
01:28:33,986 --> 01:28:38,399
(Speaking In Dialect)

902
01:28:38,616 --> 01:28:40,489
Finish it.

903
01:28:42,536 --> 01:28:43,995
(Growling)

904
01:28:44,830 --> 01:28:47,036
(Chanting Resumes)

905
01:28:48,208 --> 01:28:49,619
Long time.

906
01:28:50,085 --> 01:28:51,745
This war is mine.

907
01:28:51,962 --> 01:28:56,173
Your war is arrogance.
That makes it evil.

908
01:28:57,176 --> 01:28:58,835
That's mine.

909
01:28:59,553 --> 01:29:03,337
Lucifer, sitting in your basement,

910
01:29:03,557 --> 01:29:06,178
sulking over your
breakup with the boss.

911
01:29:07,185 --> 01:29:09,474
You're nothing.

912
01:29:11,314 --> 01:29:13,223
Time to come home, Gabriel.

913
01:29:13,441 --> 01:29:14,817
(Grunts)

914
01:29:31,751 --> 01:29:34,040
(Coughing)

915
01:29:36,464 --> 01:29:37,792
(Thunder Rumbling)

916
01:29:46,223 --> 01:29:48,797
(Coughing Continues)

917
01:29:54,064 --> 01:29:55,974
(Yells)

918
01:30:48,326 --> 01:30:50,698
The enemy ghost is gone.

919
01:30:53,748 --> 01:30:56,239
(Growling)

920
01:31:00,588 --> 01:31:02,296
(Squeals)

921
01:31:07,177 --> 01:31:08,506
(Hissing)

922
01:31:10,514 --> 01:31:14,097
The war's over. It’s done.

923
01:31:17,896 --> 01:31:21,431
No. I want you both
to come home with me.

924
01:31:21,650 --> 01:31:23,192
Never.

925
01:31:23,402 --> 01:31:25,939
"I love you.
I love you more than Jesus."

926
01:31:27,406 --> 01:31:29,398
You owe me one.

927
01:31:30,909 --> 01:31:33,067
You're gonna ask me
to take you home.

928
01:31:33,703 --> 01:31:35,032
- No.
- You will.

929
01:31:35,246 --> 01:31:38,200
Because anything else will be worse
than you could ever imagine.

930
01:31:38,416 --> 01:31:39,827
Katherine.

931
01:31:47,634 --> 01:31:50,041
I have my soul.

932
01:31:50,261 --> 01:31:52,384
And I have my faith.

933
01:31:55,475 --> 01:31:58,843
What do you have... angel?

934
01:32:04,650 --> 01:32:07,651
Leave the light on, Thomas.

935
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:15,656
Is he coming back?

936
01:32:18,622 --> 01:32:20,496
I don't think so.

937
01:32:51,696 --> 01:32:55,445
(Thomas) And in the end
I think it must be about faith.

938
01:32:55,658 --> 01:32:59,870
And if faith is a choice,
then it can be lost...

939
01:33:00,079 --> 01:33:02,866
for a man, an angel

940
01:33:03,082 --> 01:33:05,787
or the devil himself.

941
01:33:06,002 --> 01:33:10,414
And if faith means never
completely understanding God's plan,

942
01:33:10,631 --> 01:33:14,546
then maybe understanding
just a part of it, our part,

943
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:17,298
is what it is to have a soul.

944
01:33:17,513 --> 01:33:23,183
And maybe, in the end,
that's what being human is after all.
