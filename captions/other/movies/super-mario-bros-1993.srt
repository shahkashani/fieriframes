00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:42,751
I mean it's a pleasure to meet you.

160
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:44,167
Dinner.

161
00:12:45,376 --> 00:12:46,626
Do you eat?

162
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:48,584
Yeah.

163
00:12:48,626 --> 00:12:49,751
Dinner?

164
00:12:49,792 --> 00:12:51,001
Sure.

165
00:12:51,042 --> 00:12:52,917
- Tonight.
- Tonight?

166
00:12:54,501 --> 00:12:56,959
Oh! OK.

167
00:12:57,001 --> 00:12:58,792
Is six o'clock all right?

168
00:12:58,834 --> 00:12:59,917
Be here.

169
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:01,209
Great.

170
00:13:02,542 --> 00:13:04,209
Bye.

171
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:06,667
Bye.

172
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:09,459
What would you do without
your big brother, huh?

173
00:13:09,501 --> 00:13:11,584
I'd like to give it a shot and find out.

174
00:13:11,626 --> 00:13:13,709
- Come on!
- I was just about to ask her that.

175
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,667
You weren't about to ask her nothing.
You was gonna let her go.

176
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:19,001
Now she's gonna think
I'm a complete idiot.

177
00:13:19,042 --> 00:13:22,042
Come on. You'll see her tonight.
You impress her with your manners.

178
00:13:22,084 --> 00:13:24,084
Yeah, but why did you tell her
I suck my thumb?

179
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:32,001
So let me get this perfectly clear here.

180
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:34,709
What we're discussing is bones.

181
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:36,501
Not exactly.

182
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:41,209
OK, so Scapelli blasted through the bones
in the rock and found what?

183
00:13:41,251 --> 00:13:43,334
- Iridium.
- Oh.

184
00:13:43,376 --> 00:13:45,417
That's unbelievable!

185
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:49,167
It means that a meteorite hit here
a long time ago.

186
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:55,042
And we think it could be what destroyed
all the dinosaurs.

187
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,001
Wow! There were dinosaurs in Brooklyn?

188
00:13:58,042 --> 00:14:01,292
Relax, Luigi.
There used to be Dodgers here too!

189
00:14:01,334 --> 00:14:04,917
Hey, I got an idea. Why don't you come
down to the tanning salon

190
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,167
and I can hook you up with
some free tans?

191
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:11,084
Bring a nice bathing suit though,
strapless so you don't get a tan line.

192
00:14:11,126 --> 00:14:13,334
- You probably wanna take off that rock.
- Actually...

193
00:14:13,376 --> 00:14:15,626
I never take it off.

194
00:14:16,834 --> 00:14:21,417
I know it sounds weird, but it's the only
thing I have from when I was found.

195
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:23,126
Found?

196
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:24,626
I was abandoned.

197
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:28,501
I grew up at St Teresa's on
Fulton Street.

198
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:31,792
You mean you don't know who
your mother and father are neither?

199
00:14:31,834 --> 00:14:34,501
No. What do you mean "neither"?

200
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:37,209
Cos Mario here brought me up.

201
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:41,834
- He's been my mother my whole life.
- Hey!

202
00:14:41,876 --> 00:14:46,001
My father. He's been my father, my uncle,
my brother - everybody.

203
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:56,417
What are you two kids gonna do tonight?

204
00:14:58,917 --> 00:15:01,001
We can take the van back ourselves.

205
00:15:02,292 --> 00:15:05,167
Um... If you're not doing anything
later tonight...

206
00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:07,834
I would like to walk you home.

207
00:15:09,626 --> 00:15:10,792
OK.

208
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,959
(SNORING)

209
00:15:21,001 --> 00:15:24,084
Spike! Spike!

210
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:29,959
- Where you going?
- To get the girl.

211
00:15:30,001 --> 00:15:31,001
That's not the girl.

212
00:15:31,042 --> 00:15:34,042
She's wearing a disguise.
I can spot her a mile away.

213
00:15:34,084 --> 00:15:36,626
Of course she's wearing a disguise.
She thinks she can fool us.

214
00:15:38,251 --> 00:15:39,376
I'm gonna go get her.

215
00:15:39,417 --> 00:15:41,084
- I'm gonna go get her.
- Wait a minute.

216
00:15:41,126 --> 00:15:43,042
We'll follow her and we'll both
go get her.

217
00:15:43,084 --> 00:15:46,126
- Good idea. I bag her, you grab her.
- No, I grab her, you bag her.

218
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:47,959
- That's what I said.
- Exactly.

219
00:15:48,001 --> 00:15:49,001
This is the one.

220
00:15:49,042 --> 00:15:50,959
That's what you said about
the last four girls.

221
00:15:51,001 --> 00:15:52,542
- I did?
- You did.

222
00:15:55,209 --> 00:15:57,667
I just wanna say one thing first.

223
00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:02,084
I wanna apologise right now in case,
when I start to get talking,

224
00:16:02,126 --> 00:16:04,792
I start to say things that
sound really weird.

225
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:06,584
Weird?

226
00:16:06,626 --> 00:16:11,292
Look, weird is working in a bone pit
all day and then spending your nights

227
00:16:11,334 --> 00:16:14,376
reading about things that have been dead
for 65 million years.

228
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:16,376
- That is weird.
- I find it fascinating.

229
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:19,709
And I mean, you know what?
If you just wanna end this right now...

230
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:20,876
I would understand.

231
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:22,667
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

232
00:16:22,709 --> 00:16:26,042
If you wanna end this right now and
you feel bad about that,

233
00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:29,042
but you wanna talk to somebody about it,
you can call me.

234
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:33,584
You really think what I do is interesting?

235
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:35,417
I think it's incredible.

236
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:39,501
Well, you know...

237
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:41,584
If you want...

238
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,292
I could show you.

239
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:44,751
I'd love you to show me.

240
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:46,584
Show me.

241
00:16:46,626 --> 00:16:49,626
- See you tomorrow.
- OK. Good night.

242
00:16:51,334 --> 00:16:52,501
Drive carefully.

243
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:09,584
(SCREAMS) Mario!

244
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:13,626
- You don't stand a chance.
- (LAUGHING)

245
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:14,876
I won!

246
00:17:18,917 --> 00:17:20,417
That's what you think.

247
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:23,501
That was sneaky!

248
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,084
We don't even have any security here.

249
00:17:26,126 --> 00:17:28,417
That's what I was calling about
on the phone today.

250
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:30,876
I can't get the university to give me
any extra money.

251
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:32,876
Is that why you were talking about
Scapelli?

252
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:36,376
Yeah. Scapelli was down here with his crew
blasting at the site

253
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:38,917
and that's when they found the fossils.

254
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:41,167
Do you know where you're going?

255
00:17:41,209 --> 00:17:42,501
It's just ahead.

256
00:17:42,542 --> 00:17:46,042
What is this? ls this your office or
something? Doesn't it give you the creeps?

257
00:17:46,084 --> 00:17:49,876
Well, it's more like a home. I feel,
I don't know, comfortable down here.

258
00:17:49,917 --> 00:17:51,376
Comfortable? OK.

259
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:54,417
- Well, this is it.
- Wow!

260
00:17:54,459 --> 00:17:56,167
Have a look.

261
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:57,751
Awesome!

262
00:17:57,792 --> 00:18:00,251
Oh, check this out.

263
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:03,042
These are all strange new species.

264
00:18:03,084 --> 00:18:06,626
Look at this one - the way the bones
fit here.

265
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:08,834
And the opposable thumb -

266
00:18:08,876 --> 00:18:13,126
it's almost as if he was a monster trying
to be a human being.

267
00:18:16,376 --> 00:18:18,251
It's beautiful.

268
00:18:23,626 --> 00:18:25,501
You're beautiful.

269
00:18:34,792 --> 00:18:38,959
- Oh my... Hey!
- Hey, you guys!

270
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:41,334
- They're Scapelli's.
- Oh no!

271
00:18:41,376 --> 00:18:43,209
What did they do?

272
00:18:43,251 --> 00:18:44,584
What is that down there?

273
00:18:44,626 --> 00:18:48,334
Destroying everything under the sump
pumps. Thank God you're here.

274
00:18:48,376 --> 00:18:49,751
What do you mean?

275
00:18:49,792 --> 00:18:52,667
- You're a plumber, right?
- Oh, yeah.

276
00:18:52,709 --> 00:18:56,167
I know exactly what to do.

277
00:18:56,209 --> 00:18:59,792
- Mario, Scapelli's flooding the site.
- We need your help.

278
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:01,876
- Scapelli?
- Yeah.

279
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:07,376
Strap your bone on, kid. We're goin' in.

280
00:19:07,417 --> 00:19:11,834
Scapelli's been trying to force us out
ever since we got here. It's sabotage.

281
00:19:11,876 --> 00:19:13,917
Down here.

282
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:15,459
Hurry!

283
00:19:15,501 --> 00:19:18,834
- This way.
- Allow me, I'm a professional.

284
00:19:18,876 --> 00:19:21,751
- Looks like a bottom one, right?
- Yeah.

285
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,667
Bottom 116 open-end.

286
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:32,501
Bottom 116 open-ended.

287
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:46,459
Wrong again. How many times have
we got this wrong?

288
00:19:46,501 --> 00:19:48,501
You've gotten it wrong five times.

289
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:51,917
Home for five, home for five.
What percent is that?

290
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:54,584
I don't know. Let me think.

291
00:19:57,376 --> 00:19:59,876
I don't know, but it's not good.

292
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:02,876
If we get it wrong one more time,
he's gonna kill us.

293
00:20:02,917 --> 00:20:05,584
He's not gonna kill us.
He's not that nice.

294
00:20:05,626 --> 00:20:06,959
(BANGING)

295
00:20:07,001 --> 00:20:08,376
UP ahead!

296
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:09,959
It's her.

297
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:11,501
- I sense her.
- (SNIFFING)

298
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:13,917
I definitely know it's her.

299
00:20:15,876 --> 00:20:17,792
Basin wrench.

300
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,584
- Basin wrench.
- Great.

301
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:24,751
Here.

302
00:20:24,792 --> 00:20:26,292
Hand.

303
00:20:26,334 --> 00:20:27,626
Hand.

304
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:31,084
Now, does this guys know his stuff
or does this guy know his stuff?!

305
00:20:31,126 --> 00:20:32,626
I'm tellin' you.

306
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:34,917
- OK, you ready?
- Say when.

307
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:37,251
Let's go...now!

308
00:20:38,459 --> 00:20:41,209
Scapelli's just an amateur.

309
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,084
(SCREAMS)

310
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:56,751
- Daisy? Daisy, where are you?
- (DAISY SCREAMING)

311
00:20:56,792 --> 00:21:00,084
Daisy! Answer me! Daisy, where are you?

312
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:01,751
- Let's go this way.
- No, no!

313
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:04,792
- Let's go this way.
- No, it's this way.

314
00:21:04,834 --> 00:21:06,667
- That's the echo.
- How do you know?

315
00:21:06,709 --> 00:21:09,126
I've been listening to pipes all my life.
Come on.

316
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:10,876
OK. Daisy!

Come on, let's turn back.

- OK, you go back.

Where are we?

397
00:25:49,376 --> 00:25:52,042
I don't know. Maybe we got knocked
unconscious for 100 years

398
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:53,834
and woke up in Manhattan of the future.

399
00:25:53,876 --> 00:25:55,584
Maybe the Bronx of today.

400
00:25:55,626 --> 00:25:58,376
No wonder they tell you never
to come up here.

no more.

a world full of resources.

- Ready for the taking.
- I know.

409
00:26:20,417 --> 00:26:26,001
Imagine it. An endless supply of food,
clean air, water.

410
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,001
And what are we stuck with?

411
00:26:28,042 --> 00:26:29,917
This...

412
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:34,001
pit hole of germs everywhere, fungus.

413
00:26:35,376 --> 00:26:41,584
65 million years we've been exiled here
after the meteorite struck.

414
00:26:43,292 --> 00:26:46,917
While mammals roam free
in the other dimension.

415
00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:50,084
Well, not for long.

416
00:26:51,501 --> 00:26:54,042

Princess?

419
00:26:57,417 --> 00:27:01,542
I need the rock, and the Princess Daisy

420
00:27:01,584 --> 00:27:04,626
and I'll finally be able to merge
our world with theirs

421
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:06,542
and get rid of the mammals.

422
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:10,167
It's everything you've hoped for,
everything you've worked for.

423
00:27:12,334 --> 00:27:14,792
- Excuse me, cousin.
- Hello, morons.

424
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:16,334
- Hello!
- Hello!

425
00:27:16,376 --> 00:27:18,292
I captured the princess.

426
00:27:18,334 --> 00:27:20,001
She's being defungussed.

427
00:27:20,042 --> 00:27:23,084
- But I took her through the gateway.
- I recognised her.

428
00:27:23,126 --> 00:27:26,126
He couldn't tell one mammal from another.

429
00:27:26,167 --> 00:27:30,251
Good. Now, where's the rock?

430
00:27:33,792 --> 00:27:35,292
- Rock, sir?
- Rock?

431
00:27:35,334 --> 00:27:38,501
The meteorite piece that she wears
around her neck

432
00:27:38,542 --> 00:27:40,209
and I told you not to forget it.

433
00:27:40,251 --> 00:27:43,376
- That rock!
- I told you not to forget it.

434
00:27:43,417 --> 00:27:46,376
And I told you to remind him.

435
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:49,501
Without that piece the meteorite
lays dormant.

436
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:52,084
I'll not be able to merge the dimensions.

437
00:27:52,126 --> 00:27:53,501
Where is it?

438
00:27:55,709 --> 00:27:57,209
The plumbers took it.

01:13:51,167 --> 01:13:53,917
Come on. Somebody's gotta do it.
I don't got no choice, right?

1118
01:13:53,959 --> 01:13:56,751
- Luigi, this is not Miraculous World.
- I gotta go for it.

1119
01:13:56,792 --> 01:13:58,459
- Agh!
" Luigi!

1120
01:14:04,292 --> 01:14:07,042
I'm flying, Mario, I'm flying!

1121
01:14:07,084 --> 01:14:10,542
Come on. I told you. All you had to do
is trust. Come on.

1122
01:14:10,584 --> 01:14:13,126
Let's do it. Come on. Just have faith.
Jump.

1123
01:14:13,167 --> 01:14:16,251
- You're flying.
- Come on, Mario. Just trust. Jump.

1124
01:14:16,292 --> 01:14:17,876
- Come on.
- OK, OK.

1125
01:14:17,917 --> 01:14:20,501
- OK. Just... OK.
- Come on.

1126
01:14:23,084 --> 01:14:25,251
No, wait, Mario. Don't jump. It's not...

1127
01:14:25,292 --> 01:14:27,792
I'm not flying. It's just a...hook.

1128
01:14:27,834 --> 01:14:29,917
- Agh!
- Mario!

1129
01:14:29,959 --> 01:14:33,876
- Oh, Luigi!
- Oops!

1130
01:14:33,917 --> 01:14:35,334
Sorry!

1131
01:14:35,376 --> 01:14:38,251
Mario, I got you.

1132
01:14:38,292 --> 01:14:40,709
Luigi, I'm alive.

1133
01:14:40,751 --> 01:14:44,792
Good catch, huh, Mario?
I should try out for the Yankees.

1134
01:14:44,834 --> 01:14:48,126
I'd high five you, but then you'd be
an only child.

1135
01:14:48,167 --> 01:14:50,042
Let's go get Daisy.

1136
01:14:50,084 --> 01:14:52,042
Let's swing over there, yeah?

1137
01:14:52,084 --> 01:14:53,876
- Go with me.
- OK.

1138
01:15:01,209 --> 01:15:03,751
My father?

1139
01:15:03,792 --> 01:15:06,459
What have they done to you?

1140
01:15:06,501 --> 01:15:08,834
Can you even hear me?

1141
01:15:20,626 --> 01:15:22,376
Yoshi!

1142
01:15:25,459 --> 01:15:28,084
Look what she did to you.

1143
01:16:05,167 --> 01:16:08,084
- Mario?
- Daisy!

1144
01:16:08,126 --> 01:16:09,626
Luigi?

1145
01:16:09,667 --> 01:16:11,459
Mario!

1146
01:16:11,501 --> 01:16:14,084
It's Daisy. Daisy, we're comin'!

1147
01:16:17,376 --> 01:16:20,167
Let's get you off.

1148
01:16:20,209 --> 01:16:22,626
Luigi, Mario, can you hear me?

1149
01:16:22,667 --> 01:16:24,334
Daisy, where are you?

1150
01:16:24,376 --> 01:16:27,751
I'm in Devo 4.

1151
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:30,584
Daisy.

1152
01:16:34,459 --> 01:16:36,459
Oh, man, it's cold.

1153
01:16:36,501 --> 01:16:39,042
- It's working. It's freezing up.
- Great!

1154
01:16:41,292 --> 01:16:44,084
Hey, Mario, did you see that?

1155
01:16:44,126 --> 01:16:46,334
- What?
- It's trying to communicate.

1156
01:16:49,209 --> 01:16:52,709
Luigi, it's a mushroom. Come on.

1157
01:16:55,751 --> 01:16:57,626
(SHOUTS)

1158
01:17:06,251 --> 01:17:08,126
DAISY: Luigi, here!

1159
01:17:08,167 --> 01:17:11,084
- Come back. In here. This way.
- There she is.

1160
01:17:15,834 --> 01:17:19,459
Good news, sir. The troops are in place
ready to de-evolve the mammals.

1161
01:17:19,501 --> 01:17:21,876
Place ready to what? Now?

1162
01:17:21,917 --> 01:17:24,001
Who ordered their deployment?

1163
01:17:24,042 --> 01:17:27,959
You did, sir. Lena relayed the command.
We carried it out immediately.

1164
01:17:28,001 --> 01:17:29,667
Lena?

1165
01:17:31,876 --> 01:17:33,501
She has the rock.

1166
01:17:33,542 --> 01:17:35,792
Arrest her!

1167
01:17:35,834 --> 01:17:38,042
- Daisy!
" Luigi!

1168
01:17:38,084 --> 01:17:41,042
Let's get out of here. This place is
crawling with giant lizards.

1169
01:17:41,084 --> 01:17:45,501
Wait, listen. I know this is going to
sound a little strange but...

1170
01:17:45,542 --> 01:17:47,334
I want you to meet...

1171
01:17:49,209 --> 01:17:50,959
...my father.

1172
01:17:54,584 --> 01:17:57,501
Come on. Dad.

1173
01:18:01,209 --> 01:18:04,876
- Oh man.
- Well, at least he was my father.

1174
01:18:04,917 --> 01:18:06,459
He used to be the leader here,

1175
01:18:06,501 --> 01:18:11,334
until Koopa turned him into
all this...fungus.

1176
01:18:11,376 --> 01:18:13,042
- Oh, man!
- Well...

1177
01:18:13,084 --> 01:18:16,292
Well, it's an honour to meet you, sir,
and a pleasure

1178
01:18:16,334 --> 01:18:19,376
and I just wanna thank you
for all your help.

1179
01:18:19,417 --> 01:18:22,917
Come on, Luigi, you'll be talking to
the mildew in the shower next.

1180
01:18:22,959 --> 01:18:25,626
Mario, don't you see? It's been trying to
help us all along,

1181
01:18:25,667 --> 01:18:28,417
giving us the little things,
when we were hanging there.

1182
01:18:28,459 --> 01:18:30,542
Come on. He wants to clobber Koopa too.

1183
01:18:30,584 --> 01:18:31,959
How's Daniella?

1184
01:18:32,001 --> 01:18:33,792
- Is she all right?
- Daniella!

1185
01:18:33,834 --> 01:18:36,792
I promised to take her to Wrestle Mania.

1186
01:18:36,834 --> 01:18:38,667
You mean you don't know?

1187
01:18:40,751 --> 01:18:42,667
What?

1188
01:18:42,709 --> 01:18:46,792
She's in the goomba barracks
on the 51st floor.

1189
01:18:53,376 --> 01:18:56,459
- Come on, we need to help!
- Hi-di-ho, mammals.

1190
01:18:56,501 --> 01:18:58,417
Goombas!

1191
01:18:58,459 --> 01:19:00,834
If you touch her I'll kill you.

1192
01:19:00,876 --> 01:19:03,584
I'll meet you in the playground
after school.

1193
01:19:03,626 --> 01:19:04,834
You murderer!

1194
01:19:04,876 --> 01:19:10,459
Now, your father's still...hanging around,
isn't he?

1195
01:19:10,501 --> 01:19:14,709
Prepare for the invasion,
and ready the troops.

1196
01:19:14,751 --> 01:19:17,542
We're going down.

01:19:52,709 --> 01:19:54,126
Greetings from Koopa.

1204

Agh!

1205
01:19:56,042 --> 01:19:57,667
Ah, the rock.

1206
01:19:57,709 --> 01:19:59,417
Can't we get some blankets.

1207
01:19:59,459 --> 01:20:01,334
Yeah, we're freezing.

1208
01:20:01,376 --> 01:20:03,709
Look, the point is we're freezing here.

1209
01:20:03,751 --> 01:20:05,709
They are not going to believe this
at work.

1210
01:20:05,751 --> 01:20:07,834
This is a violation of
our civil liberties.

1211
01:20:07,876 --> 01:20:11,209
Can't you get somebody to fix the heating?

1212
01:20:27,001 --> 01:20:31,251
How can they let us suffer like this?
What are they? Cold-blooded?

1213
01:20:31,292 --> 01:20:34,751
- Yes, moron. They're reptiles.
- Well, just because they're reptiles...

Don't say anything, but my boyfriend
Mario's right up there.

1218
01:20:56,084 --> 01:20:58,417
- What?
- Shh!

(SHOUTS) Hey! Mario!

1220

What are you doing here?

1221
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:09,751
Yam

1222
01:21:09,792 --> 01:21:12,084
Oh, Mario, I knew you'd come for me!

1223
01:21:12,126 --> 01:21:13,626
- You betcha!
- Yes! He did it!

1224
01:21:13,667 --> 01:21:17,459
Honey, listen. Get that mattress, the
goomba mattress. Take it over there.

1225

Come on, girls. Get the goomba mattress.
Pick it up, get that side.

Very good!

1229

Hey! You must be the missing girls
from Brooklyn.

1230

Except Angelica - she's from Queens,
but she's all right.

1231
01:21:36,376 --> 01:21:39,917
Hey, I'm freezing my butt off here.
There's cold air from that air vent.

1232
01:21:39,959 --> 01:21:43,084
Yeah, we froze the pipes.
We're going for a little ride.

Excellent. Release Lena.
