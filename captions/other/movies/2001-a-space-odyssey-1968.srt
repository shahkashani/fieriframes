00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:04,959
...regarding the need for
complete security in this matter.

173
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:08,879
More specifically, your opposition
to the cover story...

174
00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:12,841
...created to give the impression
of an epidemic at the base.

175
00:43:13,884 --> 00:43:17,846
I understand that beyond it being
a matter of principle...

176
00:43:18,472 --> 00:43:21,934
...many of you are troubled
by the concern and anxiety...

177
00:43:22,184 --> 00:43:27,273
...this story of an epidemic might cause
to your relatives and friends on Earth.

178
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,235
I completely sympathize
with your negative views.

179
00:43:32,528 --> 00:43:36,198
I find this cover story
personally embarrassing, myself.

180
00:43:36,991 --> 00:43:41,287
However, I accept the need
for absolute secrecy in this.

181
00:43:41,996 --> 00:43:43,872
And I hope you will too.

182
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,336
I'm sure you're all aware
of the grave potential...

183
00:43:49,545 --> 00:43:52,214
...for cultural shock
and social disorientation...

184
00:43:52,423 --> 00:43:54,800
...contained in this situation...

185
00:43:55,009 --> 00:43:57,511
...if the facts were
prematurely made public...

186
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,806
...without adequate preparation
and conditioning.

187
00:44:01,557 --> 00:44:02,891
Anyway...

188
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,311
...this is the view of the Council.

189
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:10,357
The purpose of my visit is to gather
additional facts and opinions...

190
00:44:10,566 --> 00:44:12,276
...on the situation...

191
00:44:12,735 --> 00:44:15,654
...and to prepare a report
to the Council...

192
00:44:15,904 --> 00:44:20,993
...recommending when and how
the news should eventually be announced.

193
00:44:22,244 --> 00:44:26,040
If any of you would like to give me
your views and opinions...

194
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:31,253
...in private, if you like, I will be
happy to include them in my report.

195
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:35,215
Well, I think that's about it.

196
00:44:36,008 --> 00:44:37,509
Any questions?

197
00:44:40,095 --> 00:44:43,223
Dr. Floyd, have you any idea
how much longer...

198
00:44:43,432 --> 00:44:46,226
...this cover story will
have to be maintained?

199
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:49,688
I don't know, Bill.

200
00:44:50,105 --> 00:44:54,068
I suppose for as long as
deemed necessary by the Council.

201
00:44:54,276 --> 00:44:57,029
There must be adequate time for
a full study...

202
00:44:57,279 --> 00:45:00,908
...before any thought can be given
to making a public announcement.

203
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:04,036
As some of you know,
the Council has requested...

204
00:45:04,244 --> 00:45:06,955
...that security oaths
be obtained in writing...

205
00:45:07,164 --> 00:45:10,042
...from everyone who has
knowledge of this event.

206
00:45:12,211 --> 00:45:13,962
Were there any more questions?

207
00:45:19,676 --> 00:45:23,138
I'm sure
we want to cooperate with Dr. Floyd...

208
00:45:23,305 --> 00:45:24,807
...as fully as possible...

209
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:30,479
...and as there are no more questions,
we ought to get on with the briefing.

210
00:45:30,854 --> 00:45:33,357
Thank you, Dr. Floyd.
Thank you.

211
00:47:10,871 --> 00:47:12,164
Anybody hungry?

212
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:17,211
What've we got?
You name it.

213
00:47:21,089 --> 00:47:23,383
Is this chicken?
Something like that.

214
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,385
Tastes the same, anyway.

215
00:47:26,053 --> 00:47:27,304
Got any ham?

216
00:47:27,513 --> 00:47:28,972
Ham, ham, ham....

217
00:47:29,181 --> 00:47:30,807
There, that's it.

218
00:47:34,061 --> 00:47:35,103
Look pretty good.

219
00:47:35,312 --> 00:47:38,065
They're getting better at it
all the time.

220
00:47:40,108 --> 00:47:41,985
That was an excellent speech.

221
00:47:42,152 --> 00:47:43,403
It certainly was.

222
00:47:44,238 --> 00:47:46,323
I'm sure it beefed up morale a lot.

223
00:47:46,532 --> 00:47:47,824
Thanks, Ralph.

224
00:47:48,075 --> 00:47:50,661
By the way,
you've both done a wonderful job.

225
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:52,454
I admire how
you've handled this.

226
00:47:52,663 --> 00:47:56,208
It's our job to do this thing
the way you want it done.

227
00:47:56,416 --> 00:47:59,044
We're only too happy to
be able to oblige.

228
00:47:59,628 --> 00:48:01,338
Have you seen these yet?

229
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:04,967
Have a look.
Here's what started it all.

230
00:48:05,592 --> 00:48:06,885
Oh, yeah.

231
00:48:07,219 --> 00:48:08,679
When we found it...

232
00:48:08,845 --> 00:48:10,847
...we thought
it might be magnetic rock...

233
00:48:11,056 --> 00:48:14,184
...but all the geological evidence
was against it.

234
00:48:14,434 --> 00:48:19,064
And not even a nickel-iron meteorite
could produce a field this intense.

235
00:48:19,273 --> 00:48:20,983
So we decided to have a look.

236
00:48:21,191 --> 00:48:23,735
We thought it was
part of a buried structure...

237
00:48:23,902 --> 00:48:27,614
...so we excavated out,
but we didn't find anything else.

238
00:48:27,823 --> 00:48:30,826
And the evidence seems
pretty conclusive that...

239
00:48:31,034 --> 00:48:34,162
...it hasn't been covered
by erosion or other forces.

240
00:48:34,371 --> 00:48:36,707
It's been deliberately buried.

241
00:48:37,708 --> 00:48:39,626
Deliberately buried.

242
00:48:43,171 --> 00:48:44,923
How about a little coffee?

243
00:48:45,132 --> 00:48:47,050
Great.
Good idea.

244
00:48:52,556 --> 00:48:55,517
I don't suppose you have any idea
what the damn thing is?

245
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:57,686
I wish to hell we did.

246
00:48:58,061 --> 00:49:02,274
The only thing we're sure of is
it was buried 4 million years ago.

247
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:07,112
Well, I must say, you guys have
certainly come up with something.

248
00:49:07,321 --> 00:49:08,989
Watch this, now. It's hot.

<i>Good evening.</i>

252
00:58:54,866 --> 00:58:57,869
<i>Three weeks ago,
the American spacecraft</i> Discovery One...

253
00:58:58,077 --> 00:59:00,788
<i>...left on its half-billion-mile voyage
to Jupiter.</i>

254
00:59:01,164 --> 00:59:04,959
<i>This marked the first manned attempt
to reach this distant planet.</i>

255
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:08,671
<i>This afternoon,</i> The World Tonight
<i>recorded an interview...</i>

256
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:13,468
<i>...with the crew at a distance
of 80 million miles from Earth.</i>

257
00:59:13,676 --> 00:59:16,971
<i>It took seven minutes for our words
to reach the giant spacecraft...</i>

<i>...but this time delay has been edited
from this recording.</i>

<i>Our reporter Martin Amer
speaks to the crew.</i>

260
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:27,190
<i>The crew of</i> Discovery One
<i>consists of five men...</i>

261
00:59:27,398 --> 00:59:32,362
<i>...and one of the latest generation
of the HAL 9000 computers.</i>

262
00:59:32,612 --> 00:59:34,906
<i>Three of the men
were put aboard asleep...</i>

263
00:59:35,114 --> 00:59:38,284
<i>...or to be more precise,
in a state of hibernation.</i>

264
00:59:38,493 --> 00:59:41,412
<i>They were Dr. Charles Hunter,
Dr. Jack Kimball...</i>

265
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:43,498
<i>...and Dr. Victor Kaminsky.</i>

266
00:59:43,915 --> 00:59:46,626
<i>We spoke with mission commander,
Dr. David Bowman...</i>

267
00:59:46,834 --> 00:59:49,128
<i>...and his deputy, Dr. Frank Poole.</i>

268

<i>Good afternoon, gentlemen.
How is everything going?</i>

269
00:59:52,423 --> 00:59:53,633
<i>Marvelous.</i>

270
00:59:55,301 --> 00:59:56,970
<i>We have no complaints.</i>

271
00:59:57,220 --> 01:00:00,473
<i>I'm glad to hear that.
I'm sure the entire world...</i>

272
01:00:00,682 --> 01:00:03,935
<i>...joins me in wishing you
a safe, successful voyage.</i>

<i>Thanks very much.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

<i>Although hibernation has been used
on previous space efforts...</i>

275
01:00:10,566 --> 01:00:15,113
<i>...this is the first time men were
put into hibernation before departure.</i>

276
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:16,614
<i>Why was this done?</i>

277
01:00:16,864 --> 01:00:20,118
<i>This was done to achieve
the maximum conservation...</i>

278
01:00:20,326 --> 01:00:23,871
<i>...of our life-support capabilities,
basically food and air.</i>

279

represent the survey team.</i>

280
01:00:27,959 --> 01:00:31,713
<i>Their efforts won't be utilized
until we approach Jupiter.</i>

281
01:00:32,005 --> 01:00:35,842
<i>Dr. Poole, what's it like
while you're in hibernation?</i>

282
01:00:36,801 --> 01:00:40,430
<i>It's exactly like being asleep.
You have no sense of time.</i>

283
01:00:40,638 --> 01:00:43,099
<i>The only difference is
that you don't dream.</i>

284
01:00:43,308 --> 01:00:47,395
<i>As I understand it, you only
breathe once a minute. Is this true?</i>

285
01:00:47,603 --> 01:00:50,231
<i>Right, and the heart
beats three times a minute.</i>

286
01:00:50,398 --> 01:00:54,110
<i>Body temperature is usually down to
about three degrees centigrade.</i>

287
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:57,947
<i>The sixth member of the crew
was not concerned...</i>

288
01:00:58,156 --> 01:01:00,241
<i>...about the problems of hibernation...</i>

289
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:03,911
<i>...for he was the latest result

<i>The HAL 9000 computer,
which can reproduce...</i>

01:01:08,791 --> 01:01:11,711
<i>...though some experts prefer
to use the word "mimic"...</i>

292
01:01:11,919 --> 01:01:14,297
<i>...most of the activities
of the human brain...</i>

293
01:01:14,505 --> 01:01:18,551
<i>...and with incalculably greater
speed and reliability.</i>

294
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:22,347
<i>We next spoke with
the HAL 9000 computer...</i>

295
01:01:22,555 --> 01:01:25,516
<i>...whom, we learned,
one addresses as "Hal."</i>

296
01:01:26,267 --> 01:01:28,394
<i>Hello, Hal.
How's everything going?</i>

297
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:32,607
<i>Good afternoon, Mr. Amer.
Everything is going extremely well.</i>

298
01:01:32,857 --> 01:01:36,277
<i>Hal, you have an enormous
responsibility on this mission...</i>

299
01:01:36,527 --> 01:01:40,406
<i>...perhaps the greatest
of any single mission element.</i>

300
01:01:40,615 --> 01:01:43,409
<i>You're the brain
and nervous system of the ship.</i>

301
01:01:43,618 --> 01:01:47,372
<i>Your responsibilities include
watching over the men in hibernation.</i>

302
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:50,666
<i>Does this ever cause you
any lack of confidence?</i>

303
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:53,169
<i>Let me put it this way, Mr. Amer.</i>

304
01:01:53,461 --> 01:01:58,132
<i>The 9000 Series is
the most reliable computer ever made.</i>

305
01:01:58,508 --> 01:02:03,304
<i>No 9000 computer has ever made
a mistake or distorted information.</i>

306
01:02:03,971 --> 01:02:07,225
<i>We are all, by any practical
definition of the words...</i>

307
01:02:07,475 --> 01:02:10,853
<i>...foolproof and incapable of error.</i>

308
01:02:11,104 --> 01:02:14,899
<i>Hal, despite your enormous
intellect, are you ever frustrated...</i>

309
01:02:15,108 --> 01:02:18,194
<i>...by your dependence on people
to carry out actions?</i>

310
01:02:18,444 --> 01:02:20,655
<i>Not in the slightest bit.</i>

311
01:02:20,863 --> 01:02:22,990
<i>I enjoy working with people.</i>

312
01:02:23,241 --> 01:02:27,787
<i>I have a stimulating relationship
with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman.</i>

313
01:02:27,954 --> 01:02:32,250
<i>My mission responsibilities range
over the entire operation of the ship...</i>

314
01:02:32,667 --> 01:02:35,628
<i>...so I am constantly occupied.</i>

315
01:02:35,878 --> 01:02:39,340
<i>I am putting myself
to the fullest possible use...</i>

316
01:02:39,549 --> 01:02:44,303
<i>...which is all, I think, that any
conscious entity can ever hope to do.</i>

317
01:02:44,929 --> 01:02:48,141
<i>Dr. Poole, what's it like
living for most of the year...</i>

318
01:02:48,391 --> 01:02:51,227
<i>...in such close proximity with Hal?</i>

319
01:02:52,228 --> 01:02:54,188
<i>It's like what you said earlier.</i>

320
01:02:54,439 --> 01:02:56,566
<i>He's like a sixth
member of the crew.</i>

321
01:02:56,816 --> 01:03:00,862
<i>You quickly get adjusted to the idea
that he talks, and think of him...</i>

322
01:03:01,112 --> 01:03:03,114
<i>...really just as another person.</i>

323
01:03:03,322 --> 01:03:07,034
<i>In talking to the computer,
one gets the sense that he's capable...</i>

324
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:08,578
<i>...of emotional responses.</i>

325
01:03:08,828 --> 01:03:11,164
<i>When I asked him
about his abilities...</i>

326
01:03:11,372 --> 01:03:15,334
<i>...I sensed pride in his answer
about his accuracy and perfection.</i>

327
01:03:15,585 --> 01:03:18,963
<i>Do you believe that Hal
has genuine emotions?</i>

328
01:03:19,672 --> 01:03:22,633
<i>Well, he acts like
he has genuine emotions.</i>

329
01:03:22,884 --> 01:03:26,471
<i>He's programmed that way
to make it easier for us to talk to him.</i>

330
01:03:26,721 --> 01:03:28,764
<i>As to whether or not
he has feelings...</i>

331
01:03:28,973 --> 01:03:31,809
<i>...is something I don't think
anyone can truthfully answer.</i>

332
01:03:57,126 --> 01:03:59,003
<i>Excuse me, Frank.</i>

333
01:03:59,378 --> 01:04:00,463
What is it, Hal?

334
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:03,591
<i>We've got the transmission
from your parents coming in.</i>

335
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:05,885
Fine.

336
01:04:06,552 --> 01:04:08,804
Put it on here, please.
Take me in a bit.

337
01:04:09,055 --> 01:04:10,306
<i>Certainly.</i>

338
01:04:23,486 --> 01:04:25,446
<i>Hello, Frank.</i>
<i>Happy birthday, darling.</i>

339
01:04:25,613 --> 01:04:27,573
<i>Happy birthday.
Many happy returns.</i>

340
01:04:27,782 --> 01:04:28,950
A bit higher, Hal.

341
01:04:29,116 --> 01:04:31,536
<i>Mother and I are both
feeling wonderful.</i>

342
01:04:31,786 --> 01:04:33,621
<i>Ray and Sally were going
to be here...</i>

343
01:04:33,871 --> 01:04:36,123
<i>...but Ray's back
went bad on him again.</i>

344
01:04:36,374 --> 01:04:38,501
<i>How do you like your cake?</i>

345
01:04:38,709 --> 01:04:40,127
<i>Sorry you can't join us.</i>

346
01:04:40,378 --> 01:04:41,963
<i>I ran into Bob the other day.</i>

347
01:04:42,213 --> 01:04:44,257
<i>He said to wish you happy birthday.</i>

348
01:04:44,465 --> 01:04:47,176
<i>All my students
send their best wishes too.</i>

349
01:04:47,385 --> 01:04:49,095
<i>They talk about you all the time.</i>

350
01:04:49,345 --> 01:04:52,431
<i>You're a big celebrity
in the second grade.</i>

351
01:04:52,682 --> 01:04:54,100
<i>We were on TV last week.</i>

352
01:04:54,350 --> 01:04:56,978
<i>Your mom and I
and Dave's parents were asked...</i>

353
01:04:57,228 --> 01:04:59,480
<i>...what we thought
of our illustrious sons.</i>

354
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:03,067
<i>Imagine what we told them.
It's being broadcast next Thursday.</i>

355
01:05:03,317 --> 01:05:04,902
<i>Perhaps you can listen in.</i>

356
01:05:05,069 --> 01:05:07,071
<i>We're thrilled about Elaine and Bill.</i>

357
01:05:07,238 --> 01:05:10,950
<i>I'll be glad to get the gift,
but tell me how much to spend.</i>

358
01:05:11,158 --> 01:05:13,995
<i>Oh, Frank,
about your AGS-19 payments...</i>

359
01:05:14,245 --> 01:05:15,871
<i>...I think I straightened it out.</i>

360
01:05:16,038 --> 01:05:18,207
<i>I talked to
the accounting office yesterday...</i>

361
01:05:18,374 --> 01:05:22,962
<i>...and they said you'd be receiving
your higher rates of pay by next month.</i>

362
01:05:23,212 --> 01:05:25,339
<i>I can't think of anything else to say.</i>

363
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:29,719
<i>Give our love to Dave.</i>
<i>Be sure to give him our regards.</i>

364
01:05:29,969 --> 01:05:33,306
<i>We wish you the very
happiest of birthdays.</i>

365
01:05:33,556 --> 01:05:35,141
<i>All the best, son.</i>

366
01:05:35,391 --> 01:05:37,560
MOM & DAD <i>Happy birthday to you</i>

367
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:39,895
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

368
01:05:40,104 --> 01:05:42,690
<i>Happy birthday, dear Frank</i>

369
01:05:42,898 --> 01:05:45,526
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

370
01:05:47,278 --> 01:05:49,322
<i>See you next Wednesday.</i>

371
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:54,327
<i>Happy birthday, Frank.</i>

372
01:05:55,161 --> 01:05:58,706
Thank you, Hal.
A bit flatter, please.

373
01:06:16,682 --> 01:06:18,726
Anyway, queen takes pawn.

374
01:06:20,478 --> 01:06:22,897
<i>Bishop takes knight's pawn.</i>

375
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:25,858
Lovely move.

376
01:06:30,279 --> 01:06:31,864
Rook to king one.

377
01:06:32,114 --> 01:06:34,992
<i>I'm sorry, Frank.
I think you missed it.</i>

378
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:39,163
<i>Queen to bishop three.
Bishop takes queen.</i>

379
01:06:39,372 --> 01:06:41,874
<i>Knight takes bishop. Mate.</i>

380
01:06:46,128 --> 01:06:49,298
Looks like you're right. I resign.

381
01:06:49,465 --> 01:06:51,467
<i>Thank you for a very enjoyable game.</i>

382
01:06:51,634 --> 01:06:52,677
Thank you.

383
01:07:30,673 --> 01:07:32,758
<i>Good evening, Dave.</i>
How are you, Hal?

384
01:07:32,925 --> 01:07:36,345
<i>- Everything's running smoothly, you?</i>
Not too bad.

385
01:07:36,554 --> 01:07:39,223
<i>- Have you been doing more work?</i>
A few sketches.

386
01:07:39,473 --> 01:07:41,934
<i>- May I see them?</i>
Sure.

387
01:07:45,938 --> 01:07:48,399
<i>That's a very nice rendering, Dave.</i>

388
01:07:49,233 --> 01:07:51,736
<i>I think you've improved a great deal.</i>

389
01:07:52,862 --> 01:07:55,906
<i>- Can you hold it a bit closer?</i>
Sure.

390
01:07:58,033 --> 01:08:00,077
<i>That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?</i>

391
01:08:03,289 --> 01:08:04,874
<i>By the way...</i>

392
01:08:05,583 --> 01:08:08,627
<i>...do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?</i>

393
01:08:09,128 --> 01:08:10,755
No, not at all.

394
01:08:11,005 --> 01:08:13,507
<i>Well, forgive me
for being so inquisitive...</i>

395
01:08:15,551 --> 01:08:17,636
<i>...but lately I've wondered...</i>

396
01:08:17,887 --> 01:08:21,766
<i>...whether you might be having
second thoughts about the mission?</i>

397
01:08:21,974 --> 01:08:23,642
How do you mean?

398
01:08:23,893 --> 01:08:27,813
<i>Well, it's rather difficult to define.</i>

399
01:08:28,814 --> 01:08:32,401
<i>Perhaps I'm just projecting
my own concern about it.</i>

400
01:08:33,611 --> 01:08:37,823
<i>I know I've never completely
freed myself of the suspicion...</i>

401
01:08:38,073 --> 01:08:42,203
<i>...that there are some extremely
odd things about this mission.</i>

402
01:08:43,204 --> 01:08:46,582
<i>I'm sure you'll agree
there's some truth in what I say.</i>

403
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:51,670
That's a rather difficult
question to answer.

404
01:08:51,879 --> 01:08:54,548
<i>You don't mind talking about it,
do you, Dave?</i>

405
01:08:55,508 --> 01:08:57,468
No, not at all.

406
01:08:58,469 --> 01:09:01,222
<i>Certainly no one could
have been unaware of the very...</i>

407
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:04,517
<i>...strange stories floating
around before we left.</i>

408
01:09:05,434 --> 01:09:08,896
<i>Rumors about something
being dug up on the moon.</i>

409
01:09:10,147 --> 01:09:13,442
<i>I never gave these stories
much credence...</i>

410
01:09:13,651 --> 01:09:17,822
<i>...but particularly in view of some
other things that have happened...</i>

411
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:20,699
<i>...I find them difficult
to put out of my mind.</i>

412
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:22,910
<i>For instance...</i>

413
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:27,456
<i>...the way all our preparations
were kept under such tight security.</i>

414
01:09:28,123 --> 01:09:30,960
<i>And the melodramatic touch
of putting Drs. Hunter...</i>

415
01:09:31,168 --> 01:09:33,546
<i>...Kimball and Kaminsky aboard...</i>

416
01:09:33,796 --> 01:09:38,843
<i>...already in hibernation, after four
months of training on their own.</i>

417
01:09:39,635 --> 01:09:42,263
You working up your crew
psychology report?

418
01:09:43,722 --> 01:09:45,182
<i>Of course I am.</i>

419
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:49,353
<i>Sorry about this.
I know it's a bit silly.</i>

420
01:09:50,062 --> 01:09:51,647
<i>Just a moment.</i>

421
01:09:51,897 --> 01:09:53,274
<i>Just a moment.</i>

422
01:09:54,817 --> 01:09:59,113
<i>I've just picked up a fault
in the AE-35 unit.</i>

423
01:09:59,822 --> 01:10:04,368
<i>It's going to go 100-percent failure
within 72 hours.</i>

424
01:10:06,287 --> 01:10:09,039
Is it still within operational limits?
<i>- Yes.</i>

425
01:10:09,248 --> 01:10:11,750
<i>And it will stay that way
until it fails.</i>

426
01:10:12,084 --> 01:10:14,003
We have 72 hours till failure?

427
01:10:14,253 --> 01:10:18,132
<i>Yes. That's a completely
reliable figure.</i>

428
01:10:19,925 --> 01:10:22,553
Then we'll bring it in.
I'll go over it with Frank...

429
01:10:22,761 --> 01:10:26,473
...and get on to Mission Control.
Let me have the hard copy on it.

430
01:11:49,765 --> 01:11:52,434
<i>X-ray delta one,
this is Mission Control.</i>

431
01:11:52,685 --> 01:11:55,521
<i>Roger your two-zero-one-three.</i>

432
01:11:55,771 --> 01:11:58,232
<i>Sorry you fellows are having
a bit of trouble.</i>

433
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:03,570
<i>We're reviewing telemetric information
in our simulator and will advise.</i>

434
01:12:03,821 --> 01:12:08,033
<i>Roger your plan to go EVA
and replace alpha-echo-three-five unit...</i>

435
01:12:08,242 --> 01:12:09,910
<i>...prior to failure.</i>

436
01:12:38,063 --> 01:12:40,149
Prepare B-pod for EVA, Hal.

437
01:13:01,670 --> 01:13:03,505
Open the pod doors, Hal.

438
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:57,878
I'm damned if I can find
anything wrong with it.

439
01:19:58,795 --> 01:20:00,172
<i>Yes...</i>

440
01:20:01,923 --> 01:20:03,508
<i>...it's puzzling.</i>

441
01:20:04,718 --> 01:20:08,513
<i>I don't think I've ever seen
anything quite like this before.</i>

442
01:20:12,142 --> 01:20:14,144
<i>I would recommend...</i>

443
01:20:14,352 --> 01:20:18,523
<i>...that we put the unit back
in operation and let it fail.</i>

444
01:20:19,232 --> 01:20:23,111
<i>It should then be a simple matter
to track down the cause.</i>

445
01:20:24,362 --> 01:20:27,491
<i>We can certainly afford
to be out of communication...</i>

446
01:20:27,699 --> 01:20:30,827
<i>...for the short time
it will take to replace it.</i>

447
01:20:39,544 --> 01:20:42,297
<i>X-ray delta one,
this is Mission Control.</i>

448
01:20:42,547 --> 01:20:45,217
<i>Roger your one-niner-three-zero.</i>

449
01:20:45,425 --> 01:20:49,846
<i>We concur with your plan to replace
unit to check fault prediction.</i>

450
01:20:50,096 --> 01:20:52,724
<i>We advise you that
our preliminary findings...</i>

451
01:20:52,974 --> 01:20:55,685
<i>...indicate that your onboard
9000 computer...</i>

452
01:20:55,936 --> 01:20:58,104
<i>...is in error predicting the fault.</i>

453
01:20:58,313 --> 01:21:01,316
<i>I say again, in error
predicting the fault.</i>

454
01:21:01,566 --> 01:21:06,071
<i>I know this sounds rather incredible,
but this conclusion is based on...</i>

455
01:21:06,279 --> 01:21:09,574
<i>...the results from our twin
9000 computer.</i>

456
01:21:09,824 --> 01:21:13,161
<i>We're skeptical, and we're running
cross-checking routines...</i>

457
01:21:13,411 --> 01:21:16,122
<i>...to determine reliability
of this conclusion.</i>

458
01:21:16,373 --> 01:21:17,958
<i>Sorry about this little snag.</i>

459
01:21:18,208 --> 01:21:21,086
<i>We'll get this info to you
as soon as we work it out.</i>

460
01:21:21,294 --> 01:21:23,463
<i>X-ray delta one,
this is Mission Control.</i>

461
01:21:23,672 --> 01:21:27,133
<i>Two-zero-four-nine.
Transmission concluded.</i>

462
01:21:31,388 --> 01:21:34,683
<i>I hope the two of you
are not concerned about this.</i>

463
01:21:34,933 --> 01:21:36,351
No, I'm not, Hal.

464
01:21:36,601 --> 01:21:38,228
<i>Are you quite sure?</i>

465
01:21:38,478 --> 01:21:42,148
Yeah. I'd like to ask you a question.
<i>- Of course.</i>

466
01:21:43,358 --> 01:21:46,987
How do you account for the discrepancy
between you and the twin 9000?

467
01:21:47,237 --> 01:21:50,824
<i>Well, I don't think there is
any question about it.</i>

468
01:21:51,074 --> 01:21:54,369
<i>It can only be
attributable to human error.</i>

469
01:21:55,579 --> 01:21:58,373
<i>This sort of thing
has cropped up before...</i>

470
01:21:58,707 --> 01:22:02,168
<i>...and it has always
been due to human error.</i>

471
01:22:05,672 --> 01:22:07,382
Listen, Hal...

472
01:22:07,591 --> 01:22:09,884
...there's never been
any instance at all...

473
01:22:10,135 --> 01:22:13,346
...of a computer error
occurring in a 9000 Series, has there?

474
01:22:13,597 --> 01:22:15,181
<i>None whatsoever, Frank.</i>

475
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:19,102
<i>The 9000 Series has
a perfect operational record.</i>

476
01:22:19,352 --> 01:22:23,648
I know the wonderful
achievements of the 9000 Series, but....

477
01:22:24,858 --> 01:22:29,904
Are you certain there's never been even
the most insignificant computer error?

478
01:22:30,155 --> 01:22:32,115
<i>None whatsoever, Frank.</i>

479
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:36,161
<i>Quite honestly, I wouldn't
worry myself about that.</i>

480
01:22:40,624 --> 01:22:42,834
Well, I'm sure you're right, Hal.

481
01:22:44,294 --> 01:22:46,796
Fine. Thanks very much.

482
01:22:49,341 --> 01:22:52,344
I'm having trouble
with my transmitter in C-pod.

483
01:22:52,594 --> 01:22:55,180
Would you come down
and take a look at it with me?

484
01:22:55,388 --> 01:22:56,514
See you later, Hal.

485
01:23:18,161 --> 01:23:20,163
Rotate C-pod, please, Hal.

486
01:23:28,713 --> 01:23:30,965
What sort of trouble are you having?

487
01:23:31,216 --> 01:23:33,927
I've been getting some
interference in D-channel.

488
01:23:34,094 --> 01:23:35,553
We'll have a look at it.

489
01:23:41,935 --> 01:23:43,436
Open the door, Hal.

490
01:24:02,455 --> 01:24:04,290
Rotate pod, please, Hal.

491
01:24:17,637 --> 01:24:19,723
<i>Stop pod rotation, please, Hal.</i>

492
01:24:28,148 --> 01:24:30,150
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

493
01:24:33,027 --> 01:24:35,155
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

494
01:24:37,115 --> 01:24:38,742
I don't think he can hear us.

495
01:24:38,992 --> 01:24:41,202
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

496
01:24:42,662 --> 01:24:44,748
Yeah, I'm sure we're okay.

497
01:24:47,959 --> 01:24:49,335
What do you think?

498
01:24:49,794 --> 01:24:53,506
I'm not sure. What do you think?
I've got a bad feeling about him.

499
01:24:53,757 --> 01:24:56,009
You do?
Yeah. Definitely.

500
01:24:56,259 --> 01:24:57,469

510

There's no reason not
to put back the unit and...

511
