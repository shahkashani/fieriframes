1
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,400
THE SACRIFICE

2
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,700
Come here and give me a hand, boy!

3
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,800
Once upon a time, long ago

4
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:14,400
an old monk lived
in an Orthodox monastery.

5
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,300
His name was Pamve.

6
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,800
And once he planted
a barren tree on a mountainside

7
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,800
just like this.

8
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,400
Then he told his young pupil,

9
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,700
a monk named Ioann Kolov,

10
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:37,600
that he should water the tree
each day until it came to life.

11
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,600
Put a few stones there, will you?

12
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,200
Anyway, early every morning

13
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,000
Ioann filled a dipper with water
and went out.

14
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,600
He climbed up the mountain
and watered the withered tree

15
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,100
and in the evening
when darkness had fallen

16
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,800
he returned to the monastery.

17
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,000
He did this for three years.

18
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,700
And one fine day,

19
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,100
he climbed up the mountain and saw

20
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,700
that the whole tree
was covered with blossoms!

21
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:24,300
Say what you will, but a method,
a system, has its virtues.

22
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:32,500
You know, sometimes I say to myself,

23
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,800
if every single day,

24
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,600
at exactly the same stroke of the clock,

25
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,100
one were to perform the same single act,

26
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,800
like a ritual,

27
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:50,800
unchanging, systematic,
every day at the same time,

28
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,200
the world would be changed.

29
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,700
Yes, something would change.

30
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
It would have to.

31
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:02,700
One could wake up
in the morning, let's say,

32
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,900
get up at exactly seven,

33
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,700
go to the bathroom,

34
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,500
pour a glass of water from the tap,

35
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,000
and flush it down the toilet. Only that!

36
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,400
I'll be hard to get rid of today!

37
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,000
Beautiful, eh?

38
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,200
Like Japanese Ikebana.

39
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:28,100
I will come to your house
to wish you well on your birthday.

40
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,500
I am very honored by the invitation!

41
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,900
Here's the last of it.

42
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,600
The post office is closed.

43
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:40,700
Anyone who turns up now
will just have to wait till tomorrow.

44
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,700
Here!

45
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,000
I don't have my glasses. Please read it.

46
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,200
"Happy Birthday, dear friend STOP.

47
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:58,100
Mighty Richard greets
good Prince Myshkin STOP.

48
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,000
God grant you joy, health and peace STOP.

49
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,300
From your loyal and loving

50
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,600
Richardians and Idiotists STOP."

51
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,200
Oh, how touching!

52
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,700
A joke.

53
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,200
Friends, and their jokes!

54
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,100
"Idiotists..." That's not half bad.

55
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:28,000
"God grant you joy..."
Say, how is your relationship to God?

56
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,900
Non-existent, I'm afraid.
What do you mean?

57
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,200
It could be worse.

58
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,700
Here you are...

59
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,300
a famous journalist,

60
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,100
a theatrical and literary critic,

61
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:54,600
who lectures on aesthetics
for students at the university.

62
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,200
Hey, your lasso! Run and fetch it!

63
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,800
And essays...

64
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,100
you write them too.

65
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,800
But you're so gloomy!

66
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,900
What's that supposed to mean, "gloomy"?

67
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,800
Well, you shouldn't grieve so much.

68
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,500
You shouldn't yearn so for something.

69
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,800
You shouldn't be waiting like that.
That's important.

70
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,900
One shouldn't be waiting for something.

71
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,800
"Shouldn't be waiting"?
Who says I'm waiting for anything?

72
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,000
We all are...

73
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,200
waiting for something!

74
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,300
Take me, for example.

75
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:48,400
All my life I've been going around
waiting for something.

76
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,200
All my life, in fact, I've felt as if...

77
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,400
as if I were waiting in a railway station.

78
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,900
And I've always felt as if...

79
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,300
as if the living I've done, so far,
hasn't actually been real life

80
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,300
but a long wait for it...

81
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,100
a long wait for something real,

82
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,400
something important! What about you?

83
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,600
Yes, if thatï¿½s what you mean.

84
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,800
I just never knew you were interested
in that kind of problem.

85
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,700
But I am!

86
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,000
I most certainly am! Unfortunately.

87
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,700
Sometimes I get the most peculiar notions.

88
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,500
Yes, I mean it.

89
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,400
Like that dwarf, for example.

90
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,900
That notorious dwarf!

91
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,600
What dwarf?

92
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,200
Look here, you've managed
to muddle me up completely!

93
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,500
Oh, you know who I mean.
That hunchback!

94
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,100
Eh? The one Nietzsche mentioned.

95
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,000
The one who made Zarathustra faint.

96
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,600
Faint? What are you talking about?

97
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,800
I say, do you know Nietzsche?

98
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,000
No, not personally.

99
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,200
I haven't really studied him
all that carefully.

100
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,200
However...

101
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,700
he interests me, I can't deny it.

102
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,900
So?

103
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,300
Sometimes I get silly things in my head,
things like this "eternal recurrence."

104
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,600
We live, we have our ups and downs.

105
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,900
We hope.

106
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,100
We wait for something.

107
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,500
We hope, we lose hope,
we move closer to death.

108
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,800
Finally, we die

109
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,800
and are born again.
But we remember nothing.

110
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And everything begins again,
from scratch.

111
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,300
Not literally the same way,

112
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,700
just a wee, wee bit different.

113
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,900
But it's still so hopeless

114
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,300
and we don't know why.

115
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,100
Yes...

116
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
No, I mean.

117
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,500
Really, it's quite the same,

118
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,300
literally, the same.

119
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,900
Just the next performance, so to speak.

120
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,900
If I'd made it all, I guess I'd have
done things the same way.

121
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,600
Funny, eh?

122
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,100
But I've heard all that,
it's nothing new.

123
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,100
You didn't invent it!

124
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,100
Do you really think that mankind
could devise a universal concept,

125
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,800
a model, so to speak,

126
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,800
of Absolute Law, of Absolute Truth?

127
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,000
Why, it'd be like trying
to create a new universe!

128
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,100
To be a demiurge!

129
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,200
And you actually believe in your dwarf,
do you? In your "recurrence"?

130
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,600
Yes...

131
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,800
Sometimes I do...

132
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,000
You understand?

133
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,500
If I truly believe,

134
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,900
it will be so.

135
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,100
"Believe that it hath been given

136
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,300
and it shall be given unto you."

137
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:36,500
But now I think I'll head home.
It's late, I must think of a gift.

138
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,600
You needn't do that.

139
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,900
This is a very important day!

140
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,200
You'll be buried in telegrams!

141
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,900
Au revoir!

142
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,900
What?

143
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,900
What are you mumbling about?

144
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,100
In the beginning was the Word.

145
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,400
But you are mute, mute as a fish.

146
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,300
A little smelt.

147
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,600
Look here, my boy, we've lost our way.

148
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,300
Humanity is also on the wrong road,
a dangerous road.

149
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,300
So, up you go!
Dear, how heavy you are.

150
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,200
The first impression that Man had...

151
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,600
How has he been lately? All right?

152
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,300
Yes.

153
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,300
In what way? He works a lot.

154
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
I don't like his monologues.

155
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,400
Alexander!

156
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,400
Doctor! Wait, we'll come to you.

157
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,500
You're not equipped
for a jaunt through Africa.

158
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,000
It's quite a job, you know.

159
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,300
- Hello.
- Hello! Welcome.

160
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,000
- Many happy returns.
- Thanks, thanks.

161
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,700
And you, young man, how are you?

162
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,200
Isn't it hard to keep silent?

163
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,400
I can well imagine.
But it's good for you.

164
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,900
Sociability is a burden.

165
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,800
Not all of us can bear it.

166
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,000
- My brave boy.
- Why "my"? He's "ours," after all.

167
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,300
He gargles and goes to bed by himself.

168
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,300
Gargles? That's nothing!

169
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,900
Think how well he behaved
during the operation.

170
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,400
He's got the makings of a real man!

171
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,400
Open wide, now.

172
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,600
It looks fine. Keep that up
and you'll be talking in a week.

173
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,700
By the way, did you know

174
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,900
that Gandhi had one day in the week
when he spoke to no one?

175
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,600
- It was his system.
- Why?

176
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,100
He was probably tired of people.

177
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,800
Shall we walk here?

178
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,100
You've deserted your patients.

179
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,800
And what elegance!

180
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,400
On a day like this,
one has to live up to expectations.

181
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,500
Your present's in the trunk.

182
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,600
Still more presents!

183
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:25,100
- It's time we went home.
- Yes, all of us.

184
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,300
But why don't you two take the car?
We'll follow on foot.

185
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,100
We must finish our chat.
Right, my boy?

186
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,700
Please don't be too late.

187
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,200
All right, little man?

188
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,200
Everything's almost ready.

189
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,700
Have I told you how your mother
and I found this place?

190
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,700
We came here on a trip once.
You weren't even thought of then.

191
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,800
It was the first time we were here.

192
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,100
We had no map with us,
we forgot to bring one.

193
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,800
Besides, we'd run out of gas.

194
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,600
We stopped somewhere near here,
then we kept going on foot.

195
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,600
Frankly, we were lost.

196
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,500
Then it started raining,
a cold, ugly drizzle.

197
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,100
We came to that bend over there,
by that dry old pine tree

198
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,300
and just then, the sun came out.

199
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,400
It stopped raining.

200
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,700
The light was dazzling!

201
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,400
Then we saw the house.

202
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,900
Suddenly I was sad that I didn't...

203
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,700
I mean, that we didn't live there

204
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,500
in that house under the pines,
so close to the sea.

205
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,200
How beautiful it was!

206
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:47,300
I knew that if I lived there,
I'd be happy until I died.

207
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,600
Hmm? What's wrong?

208
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,700
Don't be afraid.
There is no such thing as death.

209
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,700
No, there's the fear of death,
and that is an awful fear.

210
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,300
Sometimes it even makes people
do things they shouldn't.

211
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,400
But how different things would be

212
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,700
if only we could stop fearing death!

213
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,300
Huh? Oh, I was talking
about something else... Ah, yes.

214
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:18,500
As I was saying, we were enchanted
as we took in the beauty of it.

215
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,700
We couldn't tear ourselves away.

216
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,500
The peace, the stillness...

217
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,300
And...

218
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,000
it was plain that this house

219
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,600
was meant just for us.

220
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,900
It turned out to be for sale, too.
What a miracle!

221
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,100
And you were born in this house.

222
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,300
Do you like it?

223
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,800
Do you like your house?
Eh, my boy?

224
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,400
Man has defended himself, always

225
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,700
against other men, against nature.

226
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,100
He has constantly violated nature.

227
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,000
The result is a civilization built on force,
power, fear, dependence.

228
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,700
All our "technical progress"

229
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:15,300
has only provided us with comfort,
a sort of standard.

230
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,900
And instruments of violence
for keeping power.

231
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,900
We are like savages!

232
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,900
We use the microscope like a cudgel!

233
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,800
No, that's wrong...

234
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,200
savages are more spiritual than we!

235
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,000
As soon as we make
a scientific breakthrough

236
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,100
we put it to use in the service of evil.

237
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,300
And as for standard,
some wise man once said that sin

238
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,600
is that which is unnecessary.

239
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,400
If that is so,
then our entire civilization

240
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,800
is built on sin, from beginning to end.

241
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,000
We have acquired a dreadful disharmony,

242
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,300
an imbalance, if you will,

243
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,700
between our material
and our spiritual development.

244
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,200
Our culture is defective.

245
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,900
I mean, our civilization.
Basically defective, my boy!

246
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,000
Perhaps you mean that
we ought to study the problem

247
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,700
and look for a solution together.

248
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,700
Perhaps we could, if it wasn't so late.

249
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,000
Altogether too late.

250
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,400
God, how weary I am of this talk!

251
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,200
"Words, words, words!"

252
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,500
At last I know what Hamlet meant.

253
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,700
He was fed up with windbags.

254
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,400
And so am I! Why do I talk this way?

255
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,900
If only someone could stop talking

256
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,700
and do something instead!

257
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,800
Or at least, try to.

258
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,200
Little Man!

259
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,700
Little Man!

260
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,200
Dear God, what's wrong with me?

261
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,100
Fantastic!

262
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,800
Such remarkable refinement!

263
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,000
Such wisdom and spirituality.

264
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,000
And such pure childlike innocence as well.

265
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,700
At once profound, yet virginal.

266
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,600
It's unbelievable.

267
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,600
Like a prayer.

268
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,600
And all this has been lost.
We can't even pray any longer.

269
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,500
I had a rotten day today.

270
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,300
Or rather, a day I lost control of.

271
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,900
Thank you, Victor.

272
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,500
A splendid book!

273
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,800
Thanks for the wine too.
We'll have it later.

274
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,300
Above all, thanks for coming.

275
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,600
Have you...

276
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,700
never felt that your life was a failure?

277
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,100
No. Why?

278
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,700
I once felt exactly that way.

279
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,700
But since Little Man came along,
all that has changed.

280
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,200
Not all at once, of course.

281
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:54,800
A bit at a time as he grew bigger.

282
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,300
I'm very attached to him,

283
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,400
too much, I'm afraid.

284
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,300
But there is something
in all this that I resent.

285
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,600
I prepared myself for a life,

286
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,400
a higher life, so to speak.

287
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,100
I studied philosophy,
the history of religion, aesthetics.

288
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,400
And I ended up putting myself in chains,

289
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,600
of my own free will.

290
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,200
But at the same time, I'm happy.

291
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,600
Today, for example...

292
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,800
What happened today?

293
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,100
I got a telegram from my friends.

294
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,000
As a joke they signed it:

295
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,900
"Richardians and Idiotists".

296
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:05,500
Old theater friends.
We played Shakespeare and Dostoyevsky.

297
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,600
- I remember.
- No.

298
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,700
- Remember what?
- Those performances.

299
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,900
- Oh, come now.
- Yes, I do!

300
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,100
I remember how you dropped
that vase from the tray and broke it.

301
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,700
And your eyes were full of tears.

302
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,400
I remember it well.

303
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,300
The vase, too.

304
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,000
It was white, with blue flowers.

305
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,600
That's right!
She does remember.

306
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,700
But those tears meant nothing.
I had something in my eye.

307
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,700
It hurt so, I didn't think
I'd get through the performance.

308
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,800
Alexander was superb as Prince Myshkin.

309
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
That role made you.

310
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:53,700
And then you just gave it all up.

311
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,200
The theater, the lot.

312
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:01,100
You threw away everything
after Richard III and The Idiot.

313
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,800
I don't know why.

314
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,000
- What "everything"?
- Hmm?

315
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,800
What do you mean by "everything"?

316
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,200
The theater.

317
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,600
Everything!

318
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,500
"Success," that's what you mean!

319
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,200
As it happens, theater isn't "everything."

320
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,200
I couldn't take it anymore.

321
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,100
What do you mean?

322
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,900
Well...

323
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,500
For some reason, I started feeling
embarrassed onstage.

324
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,800
I was ashamed to impersonate
someone else, to play another's emotions.

325
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:48,400
But worst of all, I was ashamed
of being honest onstage.

326
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,300
It was a critic who first saw that.

327
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,600
But it wasn't sudden, not at all.

328
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:03,200
So you mean that an actor
may not keep his ego intact?

329
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,600
That he must lose his identity?

330
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,900
No, not quite.

331
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:16,500
What I mean is that an actor's identity
dissolves in his roles.

332
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,900
I didn't want my ego dissolved.

333
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,200
There was something in it
that struck me as sinful

334
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,400
something feminine and weak.

335
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,000
Aha! Feminine!
So that's what's sinful.

336
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,400
I liked you as an actor,
so you quit. That's it!

337
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,500
- I don't know. That might be it.
- No, that was it!

338
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,800
I said it might be.

339
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,600
Always the last word!

340
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,500
She'll be his death!

341
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,300
Please, not today.

342
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,300
It's Alexander's birthday.

343
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,200
Thanks for defending me, Victor.

344
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,900
In other words,
first he seduced me with his acting.

345
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,300
Then he lured me from London
and abandoned me!

346
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,800
But I liked being the great actor's wife.

347
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,700
Forgive me, but I saw no harm in it.

348
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,800
Who's that, now?

349
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,900
By the way, Alexander,
I'll soon be leaving.

350
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,500
Leaving?

351
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,900
Leaving all this.

352
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,100
Has something happened?

353
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,300
I've been offered a clinic in Australia.

354
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Are you serious?

355
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,800
You must tell me about it later.

356
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,600
It's Otto, the postman.
He's carrying something.

357
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,100
Julia!

358
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,700
Your beau's come calling!

359
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,000
Good evening!

360
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,500
- Many happy returns!
- Thanks.

361
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,700
Here I am, and here's
a kind of present for you.

362
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,900
Thank you very much. What is it?

363
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,300
I don't think I can do this alone.

364
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:55,900
It's a map of Europe, from the late 1600's.

365
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,900
Is it genuine?

366
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,500
How could it be?
It must be a copy, a reproduction.

367
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,700
No, not at all!
It's genuine, an original.

368
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,900
- How could anyone...
- Is it possible?

369
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,900
How beautiful it is!
We must take it inside.

370
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,700
Come, now.

371
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,000
But it's far too dear a gift.
I don't know if I...

372
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,300
Oh God, don't say that!

373
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,800
But it's far too much.
Too much, Otto!

374
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,300
I know it's no sacrifice, but...

375
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,400
And why shouldn't it be?
Of course it's a sacrifice!

376
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,800
Every gift involves a sacrifice.

377
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,400
If not, what kind of gift would it be?

378
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,600
Excuse me...

379
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,400
Otto. My name is Otto.

380
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,300
Oh.

381
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,700
Excuse me, Otto.

382
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,600
What are you doing in these parts?

383
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,100
I hear you haven't lived here long.

384
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,200
Smoke?

385
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:06,200
Once I went to the morgue
and saw the autopsied corpse...

386
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:10,700
of a man who had smoked all his life.
I saw his lungs.

387
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,200
I haven't smoked since.

388
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,300
Hear that, Alexander?

389
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:20,000
Yes, you're completely right.

390
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,600
I've only lived here two months.

391
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,000
Before then, I taught history
at a secondary school.

392
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,200
But when I was pensioned,
I moved here.

393
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,100
And here I am.

394
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,000
Nowadays I have fewer expenses,
and more time left over for my interests.

395
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,400
My sister used to live here.
She's dead now.

396
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,500
I understand you're employed
by the post office.

397
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,700
Yes, I'm a postman.

398
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,300
But not regularly.
Only in my spare time.

399
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,500
Hello, Maria!

400
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:05,800
I've put everything in order,
Mrs. Adelaide. Can I go now?

401
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,700
Yes, yes, Maria. Thank you.

402
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:12,100
Oh, yes! Do you think
you might just warm the plates?

403
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,500
Julia can do the rest.

404
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,200
Yes, Mrs. Adelaide.

405
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,700
I'll put the plates to warm at once.

406
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,600
I'll warm the plates.

407
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,600
Then can I go?
Is there something more?

408
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,300
No, no! You may go.

409
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,100
Julia's still here.

410
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,900
Oh, one more thing!

411
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,300
Would you put the candles on the table?

412
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,000
Then you may go...

413
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,600
You have opened the wine,
haven't you?

414
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,600
Well, open it.

415
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,000
Then you won't be needed.

416
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:52,500
The plates, the candles, the wine.

417
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,200
We're neighbors, she and I.

418
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,900
We're acquainted.

419
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,100
Indeed? Congratulations.

420
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,600
She came from Iceland a few years ago.

421
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,400
Really?

422
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,800
She is very odd.

423
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,400
Who?

424
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,500
Maria.

425
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,500
Yes, Maria.

426
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,000
Sometimes she scares me.

427
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:41,500
It must've been lovely when men
thought the world looked like this!

428
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,400
This Europe looks more like Mars.

429
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,500
That is, it has nothing to do with truth.

430
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,900
No.

431
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,900
But people lived then.

432
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,700
And not badly, either.

433
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,500
But wait, what's the date...

434
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,100
...today?

435
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,500
1392...

436
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,200
It's best we put the map away now.

437
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,100
Otto, will you help me?

438
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,400
I have a feeling that our maps
have nothing to do with truth, either.

439
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,900
What truth?

440
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,000
You keep going on about truth.

441
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:38,000
- Truth! What is truth?
- There's no such thing.

442
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,100
We look, but don't see.
Here comes a cockroach...

443
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,700
A cockroach!?

444
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:48,800
Par example, madame!
Excusez-moi!

445
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,600
Here comes a cockroach
running 'round a plate.

446
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:56,500
He fancies that he's moving forward
with a definite purpose.

447
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,300
How do you know
what a cockroach thinks?

448
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,300
It could be a ritual.

449
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,500
- Yes!
- His own.

450
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,100
Aha. "Could be."

451
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,400
Anything could be.

452
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,400
"Could be"!

453
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:18,700
Otherwise all we're left with
is this "truth," "truth."

454
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,600
- Can I help?
- No, that's fine.

455
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,000
Let's put it there, Otto.

456
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,200
A fantastic map!

457
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:31,900
I'm glad you think so.
It's a first-class chart.

458
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,700
Where's Little Man?
Where's the boy?

459
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,200
I don't know.
He was here just a moment ago.

460
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,800
- Shall I look?
- No, no.

461
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,900
He seemed down, to me.

462
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,100
- Something wrong?
- I'll be right back.

463
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,100
Dinner's ready.

464
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,800
You said you had more time
for your interests...

465
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,300
What'd you mean?

466
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,300
Huh?

467
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,000
Take it easy.

468
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,200
He's around here.

469
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,200
- I'm sort of a collector.
- Are you?

470
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,100
What do you mean, "sort of"?

471
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,900
How shall I put it?
I collect incidents.

472
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,400
Things that are unexplainable but true.

473
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:34,500
I need a lot of time, though,
to gather evidence that they're true.

474
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,500
I need to travel, too,
and I need money for it.

475
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,500
That's why I'm a postman... as well.

476
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,800
Unexplainable?

477
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:48,900
Little Man should be here.
He loves stories like this.

478
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,600
Does he, indeed?

479
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,400
But still...

480
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,600
I don't really understand.

481
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,400
Well, for example...

482
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,700
No, not that one.

483
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,300
How about this one...

484
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,900
It happened before the war.

485
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,700
In Kï¿½nigsberg, a widow
was living with her son.

486
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,300
But then war broke out,
and the boy was drafted.

487
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,200
He was 18 years old.

488
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:31,200
They decided to see a photographer
and have a keepsake photo taken.

489
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,500
The mother and her son
were photographed together.

490
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,700
Then the boy...

491
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,600
the boy was sent off...

492
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,000
to the front.

493
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,200
A few days later, he was killed.

494
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,100
Good Lord!

495
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,200
In the midst of all
the commotion and calamity

496
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:11,400
the widow, of course,
forgot about the photos.

497
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:15,400
"Of course"?
Why, how could she forget such a thing?

498
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:20,600
- It's not important.
- No, it's not very important at all.

499
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:25,400
The fact is, this woman
never fetched the photographs.

500
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:32,500
The war ended. She moved to another town
far from her memories.

501
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,200
But didn't she even try
to find the photographer?

502
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,000
It was her last photo of her son!

503
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,100
But do let him make his point.

504
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,300
Sorry.

505
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,400
- Mommy...!
- I'll be quiet. Sorry.

506
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,700
It doesn't matter.

507
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,300
Some years later...

508
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:04,200
I think it was in 1960...

509
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,900
the widow visited a photographer

510
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:12,500
to have her photo taken.
She intended to give it to a friend.

511
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,000
The photo was taken,
but when she got the prints

512
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,200
she saw not only herself on them,

513
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,600
but her dead son, too.

514
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,700
In the photos, he was 18

515
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:31,400
and she was as old as she was
when these last photos were taken.

516
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,600
Did it happen like that?

517
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,700
Just as you told us?

518
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,500
Yes. That's how it happened.

519
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,400
How did you check it?

520
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,200
I've spoken with the woman.

521
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,300
And I have the photo

522
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:03,000
showing her in 1960
and her son in a 1940 uniform.

523
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,600
Oh, dear God!

524
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,800
And besides...

525
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:14,700
I have a copy of his birth certificate

526
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,200
and an official copy
of the notice of death.

527
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,900
Are you pulling our leg?

528
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,600
No, by no means!

529
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,800
I have about 300 similar incidents.

530
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:40,700
284, to be exact.

531
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,600
We are blind, simply.

532
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,000
We see nothing.

533
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:05,100
What was that? What do you think?

534
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,700
Are you ill?

535
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,200
No...

536
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,400
nothing's wrong.

537
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:48,400
It was only an evil angel passing by,
who saw fit to touch me.

538
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,400
And you see fit to joke with us, eh?
Mr. Postman?

539
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,300
There are jokes
and then there are jokes, Doctor.

540
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,500
There's nothing to joke about here.

541
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,900
"Which of you have done this?"

542
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,800
"The Lords...?"

543
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,700
Maria!

544
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,600
Who made that?

545
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:44,600
Little Man.

546
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,300
Little Man, really?

547
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:54,400
- Where is he?
- He's upstairs.

548
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,600
I think he's in his room.

549
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,000
That's good.

550
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,600
But what is it?

551
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,700
He made it for you.

552
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,800
It's his birthday present to you.

553
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:19,800
It was he and Otto, the postman,
who built it together.

554
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,200
Don't say that I told you,
Mr. Alexander.

555
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,300
He wanted to show it off himself.

556
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,700
I'll go now.

557
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,700
Happy birthday.

558
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,700
Go home now!

559
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,800
It's so damp out.

560
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,200
- May I come in?
- Yes, come in.

561
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:48,300
Oh, it's you. Come in!

562
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:51,500
Things are almost ready downstairs.

563
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:57,100
What on earth is that?

564
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,600
What's what?

565
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,300
The picture, there.

566
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,000
On the wall, what is it?

567
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,800
I can't see clearly.
It's behind a glass. And it's so dark.

568
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:17,300
Itï¿½s the Adoration of the Three Kings

569
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,400
by Leonardo.

570
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:24,000
A reproduction, of course.

571
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,800
My God, how sinister it is!

572
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:39,700
I've always been terrified of Leonardo.

573
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:09,500
...are now being organized nationwide...

574
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:16,100
This is even the duty
of all officers of the army.

575
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,800
Every responsible citizen...

576
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:25,100
is expected to behave with courage...

577
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,600
to keep a cool head...

578
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,300
and to help the army...

579
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:39,500
in its efforts to re-establish peace,

580
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,800
order, and discipline.

581
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:51,400
The only dangerous enemy
in our midst at the moment,

582
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,300


583
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:58,200
It is contagious,

584
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:03,800
and won't allow itself to be ruled
by common sense.

585
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:09,400
Order and organization...

586
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:13,700
and nothing less, good citizens.

587
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,600
Only order... order...

588
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,500
against this chaos.

589
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:27,500
I beg you, I humbly appeal

590
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,800
to your courage and...

591
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,400
in spite of all...

592
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,300
to your common sense.

593
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:50,000
Shall we eat? And wake the boy?

594
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,600
We have here,
unfortunately, such a base...

595
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,000
with four missile warheads.

596
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,700
And it is very likely...

597
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:04,500
that these warheads,
tragically enough...

598
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,200
What's this?

599
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:09,500
...will be used against us.

600
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:17,700
Communications
may be broken at any time...

601
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:22,800
but I have told you
what is most important...

602
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,000
...my fellow citizens.

603
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:34,600
You are to stay where you are.

604
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:38,000
There is no place in all of Europe

605
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,500
that is safer

606
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,900
than where we are now.

607
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,600
In this regard,

608
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:54,300
we are all forced into the same situation.

609
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:14,600
All districts will be under the control

610
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:18,700
of special military units...

611
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:24,500
so that... so that...

612
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,700
Surely this isn't...

613
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,700
Shouldn't one do something?

614
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,400
I've waited for this all my life.

615
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,900
My whole life has been
one long wait, for this.

616
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:33,000
Don't touch me! Do something!

617
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,100
You men!
Why don't you say something?

618
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,600
Can't we do something?

619
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:22,100
Mama, please calm down!

620
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:32,100
My God!

621
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,300
Victor!

622
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:39,400
At least you could do something!

623
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,400
Please!

624
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:43,800
Shh! The boy is asleep.

625
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,500
He mustn't be awakened.

626
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
It's all my fault!

627
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,100
This is my punishment!

628
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,800
The boy's sleeping.

629
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,200
Don't wake him.

630
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:17,900
- Little Man! Where is he?
- He's sleeping.

631
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,300
Julia! Go get Little Man!

632
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:29,300
Alexander, don't you even understand?

633
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:37,800
Julia!

634
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,000
Fetch the black bag by the piano.

635
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:34,000
Maybe later.

636
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:35,800
Oh, God!

637
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,900
Put it on the table!

638
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,200
Alexander!

639
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:53,800
I can't bear it anymore!

640
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,600
Please, please!

641
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,600
Julia, do you need one, too?

642
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:53,200
No, I don't want it! It's not necessary.

643
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:56,400
Yes, it is.

644
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,900
It's absolutely necessary.

645
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,500
And it's completely harmless.

646
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:11,400
It will be easier
for all of us if you take it.

647
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:16,100
No! I don't want to!

648
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:37,700
- And you, Alexander?
- No, I'll have a drink instead.

649
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,800
Just don't drink too much.

650
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:43,700
It'll only make it worse.

651
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,900
Otto?

652
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Oh no, don't worry.

653
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,000
Thanks, but I don't need it.

654
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:54,000
Julia?

655
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:59,100
We must go up to the boy.
He's not to wake up now!

656
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,900
I'll go with you.

657
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,700
Julia can stay with Mama.

658
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,400
Sleep now, sleep.

659
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,200
We'll be right back.

660
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,200
It's dead.

661
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,100
The telephone's dead.

662
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,400
Oh, dear God...

663
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:06,300
Why do we always do
the opposite of what we want?

664
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,100
Always!

665
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,700
I have loved one man...

666
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:19,100
and married another.

667
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,600
Why?

668
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:27,300
Would you like something to drink?

669
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:30,800
No, no.

670
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,600
Nothing. Thanks, Otto.

671
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,200
No.

672
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,400
I think I know, now.

673
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:48,000
We simply don't want
to depend on anyone.

674
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,300
When two people love each other,

675
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:57,600
they don't love in the same way.

676
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:01,700
One of them is strong,

677
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:06,000
the other, weaker.

678
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:14,100
And the weaker is always the one
who loves without reckoning...

679
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,100
without reservation.

680
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:26,300
It feels now as if I've awakened

681
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:30,200
from some kind of dream...

682
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:35,700
after some other kind of life.

683
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:43,600
For some reason,
I always offered resistance.

684
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,000
I fought against something.

685
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,500
I defended myself,

686
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:55,500
just as though I'd had...

687
01:06:56,700 --> 01:07:01,400
someone else inside me, saying:

688
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:06,200
Don't give in to anything...

689
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:12,000
don't go along with...

690
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,400
anything...

691
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,800
...or youï¿½ll die!

692
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:26,400
But God, how foolish we are anyway!

693
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,300
That's good.

694
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:37,600
It's good that you finally understood that.

695
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:42,200
How do you feel?

696
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:46,400
- Better now?
- Yes.

697
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:48,400
I've finally understood,

698
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:51,300
even though it's a bit late.

699
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,800
But what shall we do now?

700
01:07:57,300 --> 01:08:00,000
The telephone isn't working, of course.

701
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:08,100
We could get into the car
and drive north,

702
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,700
where it's quieter...

703
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:13,500
But it's no use.

704
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:17,700
No. It's the same everywhere.

705
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,800
And no one knows where it's worst.

706
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,700
No, no! We'll stay here.

707
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:30,700
There, there...

708
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:33,500
Easy, easy...

709
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:38,100
We won't go anywhere!

710
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:41,800
We're staying here!

711
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:47,200
Victor!

712
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:09,900
And now...

713
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Now we shall eat dinner.

714
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:17,000
Excuse me, but I must go now.

715
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:20,300
I have a few things to put in order.

716
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:30,300
What will you do, Martha?

717
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,400
Julia.

718
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,100
Go wake Little Man!

719
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:45,900
Today is a very special day.

720
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:48,400
We must be together.

721
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:50,000
Please stop it!

722
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,400
Julia, did you hear me?

723
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:58,400
- It's best not to wake him.
-Julia!

724
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:02,900
I'm not going to wake him.

725
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,800
I have no intention of doing it.

726
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:10,900
And I won't allow anyone else to, either.

727
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:16,000
He's asleep now,
and we mustn't wake him,

728
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,500
or frighten him.

729
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:22,700
A lot can happen while he's sleeping.

730
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:27,100
If God wills it,
he'll never know what's happened.

731
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:30,200
Don't scare him!

732
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:31,900
Please, I beg you!

733
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:36,500
If you have to torture someone,
let it be Mr. Alexander.

734
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,200
Or me, for that matter.

735
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:45,500
Choose whom you will,
since you can't do otherwise.

736
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:53,000
But I will not allow you
to torture the boy.

737
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:06,200
My dear girl...

738
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:08,900
My poor, dear girl...

739
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,300
Forgive me.

740
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,100
Our Father, Who...

741
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:22,000
Our Father, Who art in Heaven...

742
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,800
hallowed be Thy Name.

743
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,700
Thy Kingdom come...

744
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,800
Thy will be done...

745
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:38,000
Give us this day our daily bread...

746
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:41,100
And deliver us from evil.

747
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,900
For Thine is the Kingdom...

748
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:47,000
and the Power...

749
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:49,100
and the Glory.

750
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:52,000
Amen.

751
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,700
Lord!

752
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:02,000
Deliver us in this terrible time.

753
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:05,600
Don't let my children die,

754
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,600
nor my friends...

755
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:11,400
my wife...

756
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:13,000
Victor...

757
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:17,400
all those who love Thee
and believe in Thee...

758
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:23,000
All those who do not believe in Thee,
because they are blind...

759
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:26,900
those who haven't given Thee a thought...

760
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:35,900
simply because they haven't yet
been truly miserable.

761
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:43,800
All those who in this hour
have lost their hope, their future...

762
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:45,600
their lives...

763
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:50,300
and the opportunity
to surrender to Thy will.

764
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,300
All those who are filled with dread

765
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:59,600
who feel the end coming closer...

766
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:05,100
who fear, not for themselves,
but for their loved ones.

767
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:11,300
All those whom no one,

768
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:17,200
except Thou, can offer protection.

769
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:22,200
Because this war is the ultimate war

770
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:25,100
a horrible thing.

771
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:30,800
And after it, there will be
no victors and no vanquished...

772
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:34,200
no cities or towns, grass or trees,

773
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,600
water in the wells,

774
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:41,400
or birds in the sky.

775
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:50,300
I will give Thee all I have.

776
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:54,100
I'll give up my family, whom I love.

777
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,400
I'll destroy my home,

778
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:01,100
and give up Little Man.

779
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:07,500
I'll be mute, and never speak
another word to anyone.

780
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:12,100
I will relinquish everything
that binds me to life...

781
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:18,600
if only Thou dost restore
everything as it was before...

782
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:21,700
as it was this morning and yesterday

783
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:25,900
Just let me be rid of...

784
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,700
this deadly...

785
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:32,600
sickening, animal fear!

786
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:34,500
Yes, everything!

787
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:38,600
Lord!

788
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,900
Help me...

789
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:51,800
I will do everything I have promised Thee.

790
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:37,600
Come here, Victor.

791
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,100
Help me!

792
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,300
My boy!

793
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,100
- What is it?
- Sorry to get you up.

794
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:03,500
- Were you asleep?
- What is it? What's happened?

795
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:08,000
There's still one last chance!

796
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:11,700
A chance? What kind of chance?

797
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:16,300
A chance. One last hope.

798
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:20,000
What kind of hope?
What's the matter with you?

799
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:24,400
Nothing's the matter with me.
But Maria can do it. Maria!

800
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:26,800
Maria?

801
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:29,200
Which Maria? Do what?

802
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:33,100
You must go to her and convince her.

803
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:34,700
Do you understand?

804
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:36,900
Where must I go?

805
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,600
Whom must I convince?

806
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:42,800
Come in, have a drink.
I had one and I feel better.

807
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:03,500
There's no light anymore.

808
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:07,300
How long have I slept?

809
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:25,100
You shouldn't drink that by the glassful.

810
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:27,900
It's very good cognac, that.

811
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,800
Where is everybody?

812
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:32,400
Are they sleeping?

813
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:36,700
They're downstairs,
sitting 'round the table.

814
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:40,800
- They're very fond of you.
- Sitting 'round what table?

815
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:27,100
You must go to Maria at once!

816
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,800
Which Maria?

817
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,600
Can't you express yourself more clearly?

818
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:39,100
Maria, you know her!
One of your servant girls.

819
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:42,600
Yes, yes, yes!

820
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:46,800
I'll explain later.
Don't rush me!

821
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:50,300
Who's rushing you, for God's sake!

822
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:54,800
Why do you always
have to beat around the bush?

823
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:00,400
She lives...

824
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:04,900
on a farm on the other side of the bay.

825
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:08,400
Behind the church.

826
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,500
It's closed now.

827
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:12,300
Who?

828
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:14,300
"Who"?

829
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:18,300
I'm not talking about "who."
I mean the church.

830
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:21,400
But I asked who lives there.

831
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:24,800
What's the church got to do with it?

832
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:28,800
Who lives there?
Why, Maria, of course.

833
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:33,900
Your servant. I've been trying
to tell you that for half an hour!

834
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:39,600
Can't you pay more attention!

835
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:45,400
This is very important.

836
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:47,800
Pay attention? I...

837
01:26:47,900 --> 01:26:50,700
I know where she lives.
My wife showed me.

838
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,700
Oh, I think that... I...

839
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:12,400
Yes, it's quite all right.

840
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:15,700
It's all right, believe me.

841
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:18,900
I'll sit here by you.

842
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:21,600
What was it you said
about the servant?

843
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:27,400
Oh, yes, your servant girl...

844
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:35,900
- Did you hear?
- Hear what?

845
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:39,200
What was that?

846
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:43,500
I don't know... I don't know.

847
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:50,200
I thought it sounded like music.

848
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:55,300
In any case, you must go to Maria!

849
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:58,600
But why?

850
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:05,100
Don't you want all of this
to be over and done with?

851
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:09,200
For what to be done with?

852
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:11,400
Everything!

853
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:14,700
The whole lot!

854
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,700
God, Otto!

855
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:19,500
There is an end to this.

856
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,300
Otto!

857
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:22,400
Yes.

858
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:27,400
You must go to Maria and lie with her.

859
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:30,800
What?

860
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:34,800
I say, you must go and lie with Maria!

861
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:37,300
Lie with Maria?

862
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:41,600
It's very simple. She lives alone.

863
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:45,700
And if you only wish
for one thing at that moment:

864
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:49,400
That all this will be over,
then it will be!

865
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,800
There'll be no more of it!

866
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:55,300
But that's madness, Otto!

867
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:04,600
Good God, Otto.

868
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,800
You don't understand a thing.

869
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:12,400
It's true!

870
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,100
It's a holy truth.

871
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:21,500
She has very special qualities, you know.

872
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:24,400
I've gathered evidence. She is a witch!

873
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,800
In what sense?

874
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,900
In the best sense.

875
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:34,700
Are you joking again?

876
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:39,700
Still having me on
with your Nietzschean pranks?

877
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:45,200
Is there any other way out?

878
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:49,200
There is no other alternative.

879
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:51,800
None, whatsoever.

880
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:55,300
What alternative, Otto? What alternative?

881
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:57,300
What are you talking about?

882
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:59,400
It's best if I go now.

883
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:11,000
I've left the bike for you...

884
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:14,800
down there by the shed.

885
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:21,000
Don't take the car, they'll hear you.

886
01:30:24,700 --> 01:30:28,000
I've put a ladder against the balcony.

887
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Go to Maria...

888
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:35,100
but be careful!

889
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:40,800
There are a couple of broken spokes
in the front wheel.

890
01:30:41,700 --> 01:30:44,800
I once caught my pants-leg in them.

891
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:50,500
I almost fell in the water.

892
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:53,400
- What pants-leg?
- The right one.

893
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:56,500
Be careful!

894
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:04,800
Have you finally understood
what I told you?

895
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:08,900
Do you hear what I'm saying?

896
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:14,200
Yes, what about it?

897
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:17,600
No... never!

898
01:31:18,700 --> 01:31:21,700
Anyway, I prefer Piero della Francesca!

899
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:28,300
As I understood Alexander's words,
he meant

900
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:32,500
that it is peculiar for a man

901
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:37,000
to change, of his own free will,
into a work of art.

902
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:45,400
Generally,
the result of all poetic striving

903
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:49,200
lies so far from its author
that one can hardly believe

904
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:52,900
that it is a man-made creation.

905
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:58,600
In the case of the actor,
though, the reverse is true.

906
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:09,400
The actor is, himself,
his own creation, his own work of art.

907
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:25,700
Excuse me.

908
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:29,600
- I'll be right back.
- Don't stay long.

909
01:33:55,900 --> 01:33:57,700
How much gas do we have left?

910
01:33:58,200 --> 01:33:59,200
Will it last?

911
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:01,500
I don't know. I'll see.

912
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:06,900
They brought new tanks last week.
Don't you remember?

913
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:18,600
Julia! Come here to us.

914
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:25,900
- Who is it?
- It's me.

915
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,600
Mr. Alexander?

916
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:33,900
Has something happened?

917
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:38,400
But why stand there? Come in.

918
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:07,400
It was only by chance
that I heard you knock.

919
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:13,900
The kerosene gave out,
so I got up to fill the lamp.

920
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:25,400
Has something happened?

921
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:50,700
Why don't you say anything?

922
01:41:52,300 --> 01:41:56,000
What is it? Is it something at home?

923
01:42:23,700 --> 01:42:27,400
Something's happened at your house again.

924
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:29,800
Is that it?

925
01:42:29,900 --> 01:42:31,800
But don't you...

926
01:42:31,900 --> 01:42:33,500
don't you have a TV?

927
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:36,000
Yes, a small one. But...

928
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:39,700
it went dead about 11:00,
and didn't come on again.

929
01:42:41,700 --> 01:42:42,800
What...

930
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:45,600
What's happened to your hands?

931
01:42:53,100 --> 01:42:55,300
I fell off the bike.

932
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:59,100
Did you come on a bike?

933
01:42:59,900 --> 01:43:02,000
Yes, I did. I fell.

934
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:12,600
Come!

935
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:17,000
You mustn't go about with dirty hands.

936
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:01,600
Thank you.

937
01:44:02,100 --> 01:44:03,600
You're welcome.

938
01:44:55,500 --> 01:44:58,000
As a child, I played this prelude.

939
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:01,400
My mother loved it.

940
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:09,900
Years ago,

941
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:12,400
before I was married,

942
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:16,600
I often went to visit my mother...
in the country.

943
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:25,500
She was still alive in those days.

944
01:45:40,300 --> 01:45:44,800
Her house, a little cottage,

945
01:45:46,200 --> 01:45:48,200
was surrounded by a garden...

946
01:45:49,300 --> 01:45:51,000
a little garden,

947
01:45:54,100 --> 01:45:57,600
dreadfully neglected and overgrown.

948
01:45:59,900 --> 01:46:05,100
No one had tended it for many years

949
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:07,900
and I don't think...

950
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:12,700
anyone had ever been in it.

951
01:46:14,500 --> 01:46:17,400
Even then, my mother was very ill.

952
01:46:18,700 --> 01:46:21,700
She almost never left the house.

953
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:28,400
Still,

954
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:32,200
amidst the ruin of the garden

955
01:46:35,300 --> 01:46:39,300
there was something
that was, in its way, beautiful.

956
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:45,200
Yes, now I know what it was.

957
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:53,100
When the weather was fine...

958
01:46:53,700 --> 01:46:56,800
she often sat at the window...

959
01:46:58,200 --> 01:46:59,800
looking out at the garden.

960
01:46:59,900 --> 01:47:02,900
She even had a special chair
by the window.

961
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:13,100
Once, though, I decided
that I would tidy things up...

962
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:17,700
in the garden, that is.

963
01:47:19,100 --> 01:47:24,100
I wanted to mow the grass,
burn the weeds, prune the trees.

964
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:29,400
On the whole,

965
01:47:31,100 --> 01:47:34,700
I wanted to redo the garden
in my own taste...

966
01:47:36,100 --> 01:47:38,500
with my own hands.

967
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:45,200
Yes, simply to please my mother.

968
01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:52,400
And for two solid weeks...

969
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:59,300
I went at it with shears and a scythe.

970
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:02,300
I dug...

971
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:05,600
and cut...

972
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:07,900
and sawed...

973
01:48:08,500 --> 01:48:10,300
and weeded...

974
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:16,300
I kept my nose to the ground, literally.

975
01:48:20,500 --> 01:48:25,000
And I took great pains
to get it ready as soon as possible.

976
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:28,900
My mother's condition grew worse,

977
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:34,100
and she kept to her bed.

978
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:40,200
But I wanted her to be able...

979
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:44,700
to sit by the window

980
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:48,900
and see...

981
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:54,100
her new garden.

982
01:48:58,300 --> 01:49:00,000
In short,

983
01:49:01,700 --> 01:49:05,200
when I was finished
and everything was ready...

984
01:49:06,100 --> 01:49:08,300
I took a bath...

985
01:49:10,300 --> 01:49:15,100
put on fresh underwear,
a new jacket, even a tie.

986
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:21,200
Then I sat down in the chair
to see what I'd made,

987
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:24,900
through her eyes, as it were.

988
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:33,200
I...

989
01:49:34,300 --> 01:49:37,000
I sat there...

990
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:40,400
and looked out through the window.

991
01:49:49,900 --> 01:49:53,700
I had prepared myself to enjoy the sight.

992
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:58,600
Anyway, I looked out the window
and saw...

993
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:01,300
What did I see?

994
01:50:03,100 --> 01:50:05,800
Where had all the beauty gone?

995
01:50:07,900 --> 01:50:10,200
The naturalness of it?

996
01:50:13,100 --> 01:50:16,400
It was so disgusting.

997
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:22,300
All that evidence of violence!

998
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:28,600
I remember once
when my sister was young.

999
01:50:31,700 --> 01:50:37,000
She went to a barber and had her hair cut.
It was the fashion then.

1000
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:41,700
Her hair was unbelievably lovely.

1001
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:45,400
Golden yellow, like Lady Godiva's.

1002
01:50:46,100 --> 01:50:48,100
She came home pleased as punch.

1003
01:50:49,300 --> 01:50:51,600
Then my father saw her.

1004
01:50:52,300 --> 01:50:54,800
He began to cry.

1005
01:50:57,100 --> 01:51:00,300
I think it was the same with the garden.

1006
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:02,500
And your mother?

1007
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,500
It's three o'clock!

1008
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:20,300
We won't have time...

1009
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:33,500
But your mother... did she see it?

1010
01:51:53,400 --> 01:51:55,200
Maria...

1011
01:52:00,300 --> 01:52:04,400
My being here must be
an imposition on you.

1012
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:06,700
You can't sleep.

1013
01:52:07,200 --> 01:52:08,900
What do you mean?

1014
01:52:09,700 --> 01:52:11,500
What do you mean?

1015
01:52:12,200 --> 01:52:14,000
Could you...

1016
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:18,700
Could you love me, Maria?

1017
01:52:20,300 --> 01:52:22,300
What are you saying?

1018
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,400
Love me, I beg you!

1019
01:52:31,100 --> 01:52:32,900
Save me.

1020
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:36,900
Save us all!

1021
01:52:38,100 --> 01:52:41,300
I know who you are.
He... He told me!

1022
01:52:42,100 --> 01:52:45,300
Please, please.

1023
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,400
Save us, I beg you!

1024
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:52,900
What are you talking about?

1025
01:52:54,100 --> 01:52:58,000
Go home now.

1026
01:52:59,200 --> 01:53:01,600
Do you want me to go with you?

1027
01:53:02,100 --> 01:53:05,100
I... I have a bicycle, too.

1028
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,100
Don't kill us.

1029
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:35,500
Save us, Maria.

1030
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:41,600
But why?

1031
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:46,300
You poor, poor man.

1032
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:48,800
Why? No, not that way!

1033
01:53:49,400 --> 01:53:51,400
You poor man.

1034
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:57,500
Don't be afraid. What's wrong?

1035
01:53:57,600 --> 01:54:00,100
Who has frightened you so?
Calm down, calm down.

1036
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:02,400
I understand, I know...

1037
01:54:02,500 --> 01:54:04,200
that it concerns your home.

1038
01:54:04,300 --> 01:54:07,500
I know her, she is wicked.

1039
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:10,600
I know her. They've hurt you...

1040
01:54:10,700 --> 01:54:12,400
frightened you.

1041
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:16,500
Don't be afraid of anything.

1042
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:20,000
Everything's going to be all right.

1043
01:54:20,100 --> 01:54:21,600
Be calm.

1044
01:54:21,700 --> 01:54:24,900
Don't be afraid, not of anything.

1045
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:28,100
It's all right now, all right.

1046
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:36,200
You poor, poor man.

1047
01:54:36,300 --> 01:54:38,600
There, there.

1048
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:41,000
There's nothing to fear.

1049
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:45,500
Don't be afraid.

1050
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,800
Nothing will happen to you here.

1051
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,700
Don't cry, don't cry.

1052
01:54:59,800 --> 01:55:01,600
Everything will be fine.

1053
01:55:02,900 --> 01:55:05,400
-Just love me.
- Yes.

1054
01:55:13,900 --> 01:55:15,400
My poor dear.

1055
01:55:15,400 --> 01:55:17,100
What have they done to you?

1056
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,200
There, there...

1057
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,800
No... no.

1058
01:56:03,300 --> 01:56:04,900
What is it?

1059
01:56:07,600 --> 01:56:10,500
- Calm down!
- No, no!

1060
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:18,300
I c-c-can't!

1061
01:56:20,300 --> 01:56:21,400
I can't!

1062
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:23,500
Drink this.

1063
01:56:24,100 --> 01:56:25,800
No.

1064
01:56:25,900 --> 01:56:27,900
There...

1065
01:56:31,100 --> 01:56:33,400
It'll soon be over.

1066
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:46,900
What's frightened you so, Alexander?

1067
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:39,900
Mama!

1068
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:52,800
Hello!

1069
01:59:52,900 --> 01:59:55,000
Hello, is it Martin?

1070
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,100
Yes. Alexander?

1071
01:59:57,200 --> 01:59:58,500
Yes, it's me.

1072
01:59:58,600 --> 02:00:00,700
Your voice is so weak.

1073
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:02,400
Oh. Better now?

1074
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:06,300
- Yes, it's better.
- I wonder, is the editor in?

1075
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:09,400
Yes, but I don't think he's free.

1076
02:00:09,400 --> 02:00:12,500
You can't imagine
what things are like here today.

1077
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:16,100
You were to see him next week.

1078
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:20,200
Yes, but it wasn't important.
A trifle... it doesn't matter.

1079
02:00:20,300 --> 02:00:21,300
I'll call back.

1080
02:00:21,400 --> 02:00:25,300
All right, until then.
By the way, congratulations!

1081
02:00:25,400 --> 02:00:28,200
On what? Oh, of course!

1082
02:02:08,600 --> 02:02:13,400
Mama, did you know that
our Victor is leaving for Australia?

1083
02:02:13,500 --> 02:02:15,800
What'd you say? To Australia?

1084
02:02:15,900 --> 02:02:21,400
Yes, and he's not coming back.
He's been offered his own clinic.

1085
02:02:21,400 --> 02:02:23,300
I heard it last night.

1086
02:02:23,800 --> 02:02:25,800
Right, Victor?

1087
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:29,800
- Why are you laughing?
- I'm not laughing!

1088
02:02:49,200 --> 02:02:51,000
When did you decide that?

1089
02:03:00,300 --> 02:03:01,900
Australia!

1090
02:03:03,700 --> 02:03:05,700
You must be mad!

1091
02:03:09,200 --> 02:03:12,200
I don't know why I chose Australia.

1092
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:25,200
I don't know.

1093
02:03:28,900 --> 02:03:30,900
It doesn't matter.

1094
02:03:35,300 --> 02:03:37,200
I'm tired, that's all.

1095
02:03:38,100 --> 02:03:40,200
All right!
But what's to become of us?

1096
02:03:42,200 --> 02:03:44,100
Of Alexander?

1097
02:03:47,100 --> 02:03:51,700
The fact is, what I'm most tired of
is the lot of you.

1098
02:03:55,200 --> 02:03:57,700
Tired of being your nursemaid.

1099
02:04:02,300 --> 02:04:05,000
Your nursemaid and your warden.

1100
02:04:08,900 --> 02:04:11,000
Tired of wiping your noses.

1101
02:04:11,100 --> 02:04:12,900
Victor, are you mad?

1102
02:04:13,800 --> 02:04:14,500
Pardon.

1103
02:04:14,600 --> 02:04:16,300
What are you saying?

1104
02:04:16,400 --> 02:04:18,400
May I smoke?

1105
02:04:29,700 --> 02:04:32,400
Martha, go away! Go, go, go!

1106
02:04:37,700 --> 02:04:39,700
Go, go, go!

1107
02:04:39,800 --> 02:04:42,100
God, Mama, I'm not a child!

1108
02:04:42,800 --> 02:04:45,400
Call your father to breakfast!

1109
02:04:45,500 --> 02:04:47,800
- But...
- Is it too much to ask?

1110
02:04:47,900 --> 02:04:50,100
All right, I'll go.

1111
02:04:52,200 --> 02:04:53,800
Oh, her ways!

1112
02:04:54,600 --> 02:04:56,400
So calculating.

1113
02:04:57,500 --> 02:04:59,700
I won't let you go, Victor!

1114
02:04:59,800 --> 02:05:03,600
I don't know about Mama,
but I won't let you go!

1115
02:05:08,900 --> 02:05:11,800
Something's wrong here
and I'm fed up with it.

1116
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:21,800
Yes. You can forget about me,
and Martha, and the boy...

1117
02:05:23,200 --> 02:05:27,000
But Alexander is your friend!

1118
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,200
He'll always be.

1119
02:05:32,900 --> 02:05:35,000
But he needs you!

1120
02:05:35,700 --> 02:05:39,200
He has a wife to take care of him.

1121
02:05:39,900 --> 02:05:42,300
She ought to, anyway.

1122
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:45,900
He has a family, a splendid house...

1123
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:49,000
- and a son he adores.
- Fine and dandy!

1124
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:53,800
Julia!

1125
02:05:56,500 --> 02:05:59,500
Fetch your mistress' jacket! She's cold!

1126
02:05:59,500 --> 02:06:00,900
So thoughtful!

1127
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:04,200
Little Man. Where is he?

1128
02:06:04,700 --> 02:06:07,800
Look, he's left this note!

1129
02:06:07,900 --> 02:06:09,400
What's it say?

1130
02:06:09,900 --> 02:06:14,200
"My dears: I've slept badly this night.
Please don't wake me.

1131
02:06:14,300 --> 02:06:16,500
Go and take a little walk.

1132
02:06:16,600 --> 02:06:21,300
The boy will show you his Japanese tree
that we planted yesterday.

1133
02:06:21,400 --> 02:06:25,700
Or was it today?
I don't remember, it matters not.

1134
02:06:25,800 --> 02:06:28,100
I kiss you all.

1135
02:06:28,200 --> 02:06:29,700
I've taken my pills.

1136
02:06:29,800 --> 02:06:31,900
Forgive me, even now.

1137
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:34,900
June 19, 1985.

1138
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:38,300
10:07 a.m. Papa A."

1139
02:06:42,200 --> 02:06:46,200
Shall we take a walk,
before the weather changes?

1140
02:06:46,300 --> 02:06:50,300
"Forgive me, even now"...
What did he mean by that?

1141
02:06:51,600 --> 02:06:53,500
And why the exact time?

1142
02:06:53,500 --> 02:06:56,200
Mama, you know how he is.

1143
02:06:56,900 --> 02:06:59,200
"How he is..."

1144
02:07:01,700 --> 02:07:06,100
I think that "his" kindness

1145
02:07:06,200 --> 02:07:08,400
would be enough to see us all through.

1146
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:10,300
But he'll be around longer than that.

1147
02:07:11,100 --> 02:07:12,600
"How he is!"

1148
02:07:12,700 --> 02:07:14,800
What'd I say wrong?

1149
02:07:15,500 --> 02:07:19,400
Have you enough kindness left for "him"?

1150
02:07:19,500 --> 02:07:23,500
All right, Victor.
But why must he be such a child?

1151
02:07:24,500 --> 02:07:26,700
Maybe I want to be a child as well!

1152
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:31,500
We all want something.
I, for one, want to go to Australia.

1153
02:07:52,700 --> 02:07:55,300
Well, gather the ashes.

1154
02:07:56,200 --> 02:08:00,000
Put them in a glass,
fill it with wine, and drink it.

1155
02:08:00,100 --> 02:08:02,200
- Why?
- Don't ask me.

1156
02:08:03,200 --> 02:08:05,100
Someone said so.

1157
02:08:05,700 --> 02:08:09,500
If you do, you'll remember this
the rest of your life.

1158
02:08:13,500 --> 02:08:15,200
Come, let's go.

1159
02:08:15,700 --> 02:08:18,300
Julia, come with us!

1160
02:08:18,400 --> 02:08:20,500
Fetch the boy and we'll go.

1161
02:08:28,600 --> 02:08:30,600
I had a dream recently.

1162
02:08:31,900 --> 02:08:34,400
I was walking the streets, begging.

1163
02:08:36,500 --> 02:08:40,400
When I woke, I cried and cried.

1164
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,300
The boy's not there!

1165
02:08:43,400 --> 02:08:45,300
He's already gone out.

1166
02:08:45,400 --> 02:08:47,100
I think I know where.

1167
02:08:48,400 --> 02:08:50,200
To the Japanese tree?

1168
02:08:50,300 --> 02:08:53,300
He and the boy are just crazy
about their Japan.

1169
02:08:54,100 --> 02:08:55,400
Why just Japan?

1170
02:08:55,500 --> 02:08:58,200
First it's Australia, then Japan.

1171
02:08:59,100 --> 02:09:01,600
God, I can't take much more of this!

1172
02:09:02,300 --> 02:09:06,800
What about this morning?
I turned on his music...

1173
02:09:06,900 --> 02:09:10,300
But he didn't fancy his Japanese.
He shut it off.

1174
02:09:11,400 --> 02:09:14,900
He says he and the boy
were Japanese in an earlier life.

1175
02:09:15,700 --> 02:09:19,500
I wish someone would tell him
what to make of this life.

1176
02:09:19,600 --> 02:09:22,500
Maybe that springs
from a deep inner need.

1177
02:09:23,400 --> 02:09:25,600
Maybe it's easier for him so.

1178
02:09:26,300 --> 02:09:29,100
Why can't I find an easier way?

1179
02:09:29,200 --> 02:09:30,700
Can't you?

1180
02:09:31,300 --> 02:09:35,300
You seem to have all sorts
of schemes to that end.

1181
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:38,300
But nothing quite
so far-fetched as Australia.

1182
02:09:38,400 --> 02:09:44,200
My God, what is all that nonsense about?

1183
02:09:45,100 --> 02:09:47,200
Australia! It's absurd!

1184
02:11:17,700 --> 02:11:19,400
Flowers!

1185
02:13:54,700 --> 02:13:56,700
I don't understand.

1186
02:14:07,900 --> 02:14:10,000
What've I done with them?
Where are they?

1187
02:18:01,300 --> 02:18:02,900
Alexander!

1188
02:18:12,100 --> 02:18:13,800
What's happened?

1189
02:18:13,900 --> 02:18:17,700
I did it. Don't be upset!
Listen to me, Victor.

1190
02:18:17,700 --> 02:18:20,100
I've got something very impor-

1191
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:23,200
No! Silence!

1192
02:18:29,700 --> 02:18:31,900
Say nothing! Ask nothing!

1193
02:19:16,100 --> 02:19:19,100
Come, Alexander!
You can't stay here!

1194
02:19:29,200 --> 02:19:30,900
Come, now.

1195
02:19:38,800 --> 02:19:41,600
Let him be!
What are you doing to him?

1196
02:19:42,700 --> 02:19:44,700
Don't touch him!

1197
02:21:24,400 --> 02:21:26,400
See you, Alexander!

1198
02:26:42,300 --> 02:26:45,400
In the beginning was the Word.

1199
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,300
Why is that, Papa?
