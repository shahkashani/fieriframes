00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,769
(Recording of opera music plays)

2
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,731
(Footsteps)

3
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,780
(Knock at door)

4
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:08,974
You weren't followed?

5
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,259
No.

6
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,132
Better come in.

7
00:01:17,381 --> 00:01:20,054
Trust no one, Jim.

8
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:22,138
Especially not in the mainstream.

9
00:01:27,341 --> 00:01:28,819
Sit down.

10
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:45,499
I understand you still have
one Hungarian identity running?

11
00:01:46,621 --> 00:01:48,054
I do.

12
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:56,252
I want you to go to Budapest.

13
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:01,102
This is not above board.

14
00:02:01,222 --> 00:02:03,178
Nobody else knows.

15
00:02:04,942 --> 00:02:07,090
They're after my head, Jim boy.

16
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,373
Do you understand?

17
00:02:33,103 --> 00:02:36,013
I have had an offer of service.

18
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:41,417
A Hungarian general
wants to come over.

19
00:02:42,742 --> 00:02:44,778
I would like you to meet him.

20
00:02:47,743 --> 00:02:50,892
He has some information
that I need, Jim.

21
00:02:52,982 --> 00:02:54,893
What information?

22
00:02:56,702 --> 00:02:58,216
Treasure.

23
00:03:01,263 --> 00:03:03,696
He has the name of the mole...

24
00:03:03,822 --> 00:03:07,337
the Russians have planted
in the British intelligence service...

25
00:03:07,462 --> 00:03:10,261
right at the top of the Circus.

26
00:03:15,223 --> 00:03:18,657
There's a rotten apple, Jim.

27
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,773
We have to find it.

28
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,499
(♪ Jazz)

29
00:04:35,864 --> 00:04:38,617
(Rumbling)

30
00:04:38,744 --> 00:04:41,018
(Clatter)

31
00:05:07,783 --> 00:05:09,421
Stop!

32
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:47,582
(Clock chimes)

33
00:06:18,904 --> 00:06:22,181
(Control) Would you witness this for me?

34
00:06:22,305 --> 00:06:24,899
I wish I could done more, Control.

35
00:06:25,025 --> 00:06:27,460
You did all you could, Percy.

36
00:06:31,384 --> 00:06:35,936
Well, a man should know
when to leave the party.

37
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:41,062
What about Smiley?

38
00:06:41,905 --> 00:06:44,261
Smiley is leaving with me.

39
00:07:05,106 --> 00:07:06,858
You little prick, Esterhase.

40
00:09:36,747 --> 00:09:40,058
(Alarm clock)

41
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,218
Gentlemen, shall we start?

42
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:21,268
(Secretary) Under Secretary Lacon
is ready for you, Sir Percy.

43
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:27,544
The Treasury don't understand.

44
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:30,743
Why can't the intelligence service
simply put in a request

45
00:12:30,871 --> 00:12:32,382
for a general increase in funding

46
00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:35,308
and then you account
for the spend on your special operation?

47
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,029
Operation Witchcraft
needs to remain secret.

48
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,984
- It's a fiefdom of its own.
- Yes, that's what's worrying us.

49
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,625
The whole thing.
very unaccountable, isn't it?

50
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,745
And this London house
that nobody knows the address of,

51
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,429
is that really necessary?

52
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:54,782
Now more than ever.
We need to protect our Soviet source.

53
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:58,461
So where do you propose we meet?
In a café?

54
00:12:58,592 --> 00:13:01,184
The rent and rates on this house
have doubled.

55
00:13:02,551 --> 00:13:05,269
We spent millions on nuclear warheads.

56
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:08,144
We're asking
for a few thousand for a house.

57
00:13:08,271 --> 00:13:10,148
I wonder if Karla has the same problem

58
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,943
with the Treasury at the Kremlin.

59
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:13,505
Look, nobody underestimates

60
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,144
the importance of the job
you chaps are doing.

61
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,466
But what happened
in Budapest last year,

62
00:13:20,431 --> 00:13:22,183
that was a disaster.

63
00:13:22,311 --> 00:13:24,143
With respect, sir,

64
00:13:24,272 --> 00:13:27,184
it wasn't one of your civil servants
that got killed, was it?

65
00:13:27,312 --> 00:13:29,620
Now this isn't about soldiers
in trenches any more.

66
00:13:29,751 --> 00:13:31,946
- We're the front line now...
- Roy!

67
00:13:32,071 --> 00:13:35,303
For 25 years we've been the only thing
standing between them and Karla

68
00:13:35,432 --> 00:13:37,582
and Moscow
and the third bloody world war.

69
00:13:39,712 --> 00:13:42,668
Look, the Minister's very pleased
with your progress so far.

70
00:13:44,671 --> 00:13:46,343
He's less pleased, though,

71
00:13:46,471 --> 00:13:48,939
with the lack of progress
with our American cousins.

72
00:13:50,552 --> 00:13:51,905
You see,

73
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:54,023
in their eyes,

74
00:13:54,152 --> 00:13:56,460
you're still a leaky ship.

75
00:14:10,151 --> 00:14:11,505
(Buzzer)

76
00:14:13,991 --> 00:14:14,901
Yes?

77
00:14:15,031 --> 00:14:17,944
Someone on the line for you, sir.
Seems urgent.

78
00:14:18,072 --> 00:14:19,744
All right, well put him through.

79
00:14:19,872 --> 00:14:21,305
(Phone rings)

80
00:14:21,432 --> 00:14:24,741
- Hello?
- Is this Under Secretary Lacon?

81
00:14:24,871 --> 00:14:26,145
Yes.

82
00:14:26,271 --> 00:14:28,388
My name's Ricki Tarr.

83
00:14:29,632 --> 00:14:31,748
- What do you want?
- I need to meet you.

84
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:36,189
If you need to confirm who I am,
you can talk to my boss at the Circus,

85
00:14:36,313 --> 00:14:37,984
Peter Guillam.

86
00:14:38,112 --> 00:14:40,626
But only Guillam, no one else.

87
00:14:54,632 --> 00:14:56,111
You got clearance for that?

88
00:14:56,232 --> 00:14:58,985
Well, I'm not bloody
chaining it up outside.

89
00:14:59,112 --> 00:15:01,627
Mind you, no better off in here
with this bunch of bloody cut-throats.

90
00:15:01,753 --> 00:15:04,221
They'd have the gold out of your teeth.

91
00:15:04,353 --> 00:15:07,742
Thought I'd pop in and catch a glimpse
of the new girl before Bland gets to her.

92
00:15:07,872 --> 00:15:11,070
Ah, yes. Belinda the blonde.

93
00:15:11,193 --> 00:15:13,149
- Has he seen her yet?
- Of course he has.

94
00:15:13,273 --> 00:15:14,911
Came down first thing this morning.

95
00:15:15,033 --> 00:15:16,672
Belinda.

96
00:15:17,514 --> 00:15:18,865
(Rings bicycle bell)

97
00:15:22,992 --> 00:15:24,983
(Phone rings)

98
00:15:26,113 --> 00:15:29,185
- Peter Guillam.
- Hello, Peter, this is Oliver.

99
00:15:29,313 --> 00:15:31,782
Just ringing to find out...

100
00:15:31,914 --> 00:15:35,222
(Joan Bakewell on radio) So Winston
Churchill saved your life, Edie.

101
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:37,913
(Edie) I was working in the kitchen,
getting dinner ready.

102
00:15:38,033 --> 00:15:39,671
And he was late, you see.

103
00:15:39,793 --> 00:15:42,069
- During a raid?
- During a raid, you see.

104
00:15:42,194 --> 00:15:43,946
He said,
Why aren't you in that shelter?

105
00:15:44,074 --> 00:15:45,553
- Why weren't you?
- Well, because...

106
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:58,590
(Guillam) I was sorry to hear
about Control, Mr. Smiley.

107
00:16:10,434 --> 00:16:13,232
He said Tarr called him
from a phone box.

108
00:16:21,754 --> 00:16:24,587
He said there's a mole,

109
00:16:26,475 --> 00:16:28,862
right at the top of the Circus,

110
00:16:30,154 --> 00:16:32,462
that he's been there for years.

111
00:16:48,594 --> 00:16:50,391
(Clears throat)

112
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:53,907
It does mean

113
00:16:54,035 --> 00:16:56,831
you're rather well placed
to look into this matter for us now,

114
00:16:56,954 --> 00:16:58,945
doesn't it?

115
00:16:59,954 --> 00:17:01,626
Outside the family.

116
00:17:10,673 --> 00:17:12,743
I'm retired, Oliver.

117
00:17:12,873 --> 00:17:14,944
You fired me.

118
00:17:15,074 --> 00:17:16,871
The thing is,

119
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,872
some time ago before Control died,

120
00:17:18,995 --> 00:17:21,429
he came to me
with a similar suggestion.

121
00:17:22,715 --> 00:17:24,705
That there is a mole.

122
00:17:27,674 --> 00:17:29,745
He never mentioned
his suspicions to you?

123
00:17:32,075 --> 00:17:33,064
No.

124
00:17:33,195 --> 00:17:36,632
Oh, I just thought that
as you were his man, so to speak...

125
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:39,029
What did you say to him?

126
00:17:39,154 --> 00:17:41,793
I'm afraid I thought his paranoia
had rather gotten the better of him

127
00:17:41,914 --> 00:17:44,792
and he was going to pull
his whole house down.

128
00:17:44,914 --> 00:17:46,906
That bloody mess in Budapest.

129
00:17:51,156 --> 00:17:53,065
Damn it, George.

130
00:17:53,194 --> 00:17:55,150
It's your generation, your legacy.

131
00:17:56,995 --> 00:17:59,748
I would have thought, if there.
any truth in it, you'd want to...

132
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:31,473
I'll keep Peter.

133
00:18:32,836 --> 00:18:36,032
And there's a retired
Special Branch man, Mendel.

134
00:18:37,155 --> 00:18:39,147
I should like to have him.

135
00:18:40,276 --> 00:18:41,391
(Scraping)

136
00:18:41,516 --> 00:18:43,427
- Lift up.
- (Buzzing)

137
00:18:47,555 --> 00:18:49,148
And quickly down again.

138
00:18:53,075 --> 00:18:56,352
There's a place I know, sir.
A little hotel near Liverpool Street.

139
00:19:00,397 --> 00:19:01,350
(Buzzing)

140
00:19:10,356 --> 00:19:11,756
(Whirring)

141
00:19:11,877 --> 00:19:13,435
(Buzzing)

142
00:19:28,517 --> 00:19:32,953
Be careful with it. Please.
It's Georgian.

143
00:19:33,076 --> 00:19:36,705
My friend wants peace and quiet
in order to work, Mrs. Pope Graham.

144
00:19:36,836 --> 00:19:37,906
No disturbances.

145
00:19:38,757 --> 00:19:41,225
Her real name is just Graham.

146
00:19:41,357 --> 00:19:43,392
Added the Pope for a touch of class.

147
00:19:57,316 --> 00:20:01,434
(Smiley) Peter, did you get the keys
to Control's flat?

148
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:12,673
♪ And did those feet in ancient time

149

mountains green?

150
00:20:19,397 --> 00:20:20,547
Oh!

151
00:21:45,198 --> 00:21:46,188
(Control) George!

152
00:21:48,157 --> 00:21:49,556
George, get in here!

153
00:21:53,718 --> 00:21:55,549
George.

154
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:59,149
Sit down.

155
00:22:04,238 --> 00:22:06,308
Take a look at this nonsense.

156
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:12,593
Report by Soviet high command

157
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,427
on their recent naval exercises
in the Black Sea.

158
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:19,072
Just what the admiralty
has been begging us

159
00:22:19,198 --> 00:22:20,836
for some information on.

160
00:22:22,078 --> 00:22:24,070
- Where did you get this?
- I didn't.

161
00:22:24,199 --> 00:22:26,030
Percy and his little cabal
walked in with it.

162
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,151
- Look, Control...
- Shut up.

163
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,153
Style appalling.

164
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:34,157
Patently a fabrication
from beginning to end.

165
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:38,238
- Just could be the real thing.
- Well, if it's genuine, it's gold dust.

166
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,919
But its topicality makes it suspect.

167
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,190
Smiley is suspicious, Percy.

168
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:48,038
Where did it come from?
What's the access?

169
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,116
A new secret source of mine.

170
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,832
But how could he
possibly have access?

171
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,997
He has access to the most sensitive
levels of policy-making.

172
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,356
We've named the operation Witchcraft.

173
00:22:58,478 --> 00:23:01,277
Oh, Percy and his pals
bypassed us, Smiley.

174
00:23:01,399 --> 00:23:03,515
Gone straight to the minister.

175
00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:07,713
Percy has been allowed to keep
the identity of his new friend

176
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,239
top secret.

177
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,795
The minister agrees too many secrets
are blown around here.

178
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:14,750
Too much failure,
too many scandals.

179
00:23:14,879 --> 00:23:18,077
- Too little solid intelligence.
- Percy does have a point, Control.

180
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,760
We should be fighting Communism,
not each other.

181
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,475
Meanwhile we're losing our reputation,
our partners.

182
00:23:23,601 --> 00:23:24,827
Your bloody Yanks!

183
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:27,269
We've had enough!
There's going to be changes.

184
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,028
We need to decide if want to be
part of the past or part of the future.

185
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:34,152
I should have left you
where I found you.

186
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,236
- Look!
- Control...

187
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,033
Out, all of you!

188
00:23:59,961 --> 00:24:03,077
If Witchcraft is genuine...

189
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,396
(Control) Nothing is genuine any more.

190
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,953
(Guillam) George...

191
00:24:27,721 --> 00:24:30,713
Do you want me to get
this stuff over to the hotel?

192
00:24:42,321 --> 00:24:44,312
(Train passing)

193
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,156
Thank you.
Uh, anywhere will do.

194
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:55,360
- Peter?
- Hm?

195
00:24:55,481 --> 00:24:57,757
I need you to do something for me.

196
00:25:07,001 --> 00:25:08,879
I'd like you to go to the Circus.

197
00:25:11,402 --> 00:25:14,360
In the cabinet
at the duty officers' station

198
00:25:14,482 --> 00:25:16,630
are records of staff recently retired.

199
00:25:19,641 --> 00:25:21,552
I'd like photographs of them

200
00:25:21,681 --> 00:25:25,880
and of the diagram of the Circus.
reorganisation under Percy Alleline,

201
00:25:26,762 --> 00:25:30,515
along with a list of all payments
made from the Reptile fund.

202
00:26:02,162 --> 00:26:05,438
- Help you with anything, Bill?
- I was just looking for his Majesty.

203
00:26:05,562 --> 00:26:07,633
Well, he's out walking the battlements.

204
00:26:10,363 --> 00:26:11,714
Oh.

205
00:26:11,841 --> 00:26:13,673
(Speaks Hungarian)

206
00:26:45,283 --> 00:26:49,322
- Heard you had an accident, Peter.
- Yeah, I cut my hand open on a drawer.

207
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:52,038
When are you going
to get some new furniture up here?

208
00:26:54,762 --> 00:26:58,152
I'll have a word with Esterhase.
We'll make it a priority on the top floor.

209
00:26:59,762 --> 00:27:01,560
- Where are you off to?
- Lunch.

210
00:27:03,843 --> 00:27:05,595
Want some company?

211
00:27:06,604 --> 00:27:08,558
(Guillam)
According to the personnel files,

212
00:27:08,682 --> 00:27:10,240
seven were due for retirement anyway.

213
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:12,479
Another four don't seem
particularly mysterious.

214
00:27:12,603 --> 00:27:15,481
Jerry Westerby was dismissed
December 4.

215
00:27:16,603 --> 00:27:18,401
Connie Sachs retired November 28.

216
00:27:18,524 --> 00:27:21,559
That's just two weeks
after you and Control were forced out.

217
00:27:30,844 --> 00:27:33,483
- Return to Oxford, please.
- That's 1.15.

218
00:27:51,363 --> 00:27:54,162
Percy has always resisted
any proposal

219
00:27:54,284 --> 00:27:57,913
of a wider exploitation
of Witchcraft's intelligence.

220
00:27:58,044 --> 00:27:59,842
Drop the bloody jargon, Lacon.

221
00:27:59,965 --> 00:28:02,682
I've refused to share Witchcraft
with our allies so far, Minister.

222
00:28:04,043 --> 00:28:05,762
Greedy boy.

223
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:09,193
My goal has been to establish
its track record beyond all doubt.

224
00:28:13,204 --> 00:28:16,798
I think the time has come to approach
our American brothers-in-arms.

225
00:28:19,243 --> 00:28:23,123
- Will they take us back into bed?
- I'm not interested in a one-off trade.

226
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:27,557
I want on-going access
to American intelligence.

227
00:28:27,685 --> 00:28:29,198
You think we can get it?

228
00:28:29,325 --> 00:28:32,953
With Witchcraft on our side, we can
get anything we bloody well want.

229
00:28:37,165 --> 00:28:38,484
Fine.

230
00:28:39,405 --> 00:28:40,474
Carry on.

231
00:28:43,645 --> 00:28:45,042
Thank you.

232
00:28:56,005 --> 00:28:58,518
(Male actor) And I strike thee down...

233
00:29:23,165 --> 00:29:24,234
Oh, I, uh...

234
00:29:28,004 --> 00:29:30,997
Not supposed to.
Doctor's orders.

235
00:29:33,645 --> 00:29:35,476
Wicked, wicked George.

236
00:29:56,604 --> 00:29:58,482
I don't know about you, George,

237
00:29:58,605 --> 00:30:01,039
but I feel seriously under-fucked.

238
00:30:04,686 --> 00:30:06,802
I heard Ann left you again.

239
00:30:09,005 --> 00:30:12,395
She doesn't deserve you, George,
not one hair on your head.

240
00:30:12,525 --> 00:30:16,644
You left the Circus
shortly after I retired.

241
00:30:17,926 --> 00:30:21,078
I didn't leave. I was dismissed.

242
00:30:21,207 --> 00:30:24,881
Chucked out on the rubbish heap,
like you.

243
00:30:25,005 --> 00:30:25,994
Why?

244
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:32,321
(Connie) Polyakov.

245
00:30:33,406 --> 00:30:35,204
Do you remember him?

246
00:30:36,565 --> 00:30:38,396
(Smiley) From the Soviet Embassy?

247
00:30:38,525 --> 00:30:42,314
(Connie) Alexsey Polyakov,
cultural attaché here in London.

248
00:30:43,486 --> 00:30:47,526
When he arrived here 15 years ago,
I requested he be checked out.

249
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:52,161
He was graded whiter than white.
Didn't put a foot wrong.

250
00:30:53,406 --> 00:30:55,237
(Smiley) But you disagreed?

251
00:30:55,366 --> 00:30:57,085
(Connie) There's a story
you must have heard

252
00:30:57,207 --> 00:31:00,039
that Karla has set up a secret cell.

253
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:02,044
The personnel are all ex-military,

254
00:31:02,167 --> 00:31:06,078
trained to handle
deep-penetration agents, moles.

255
00:31:06,205 --> 00:31:08,879
(Smiley) There are always stories,
Connie.

256
00:31:09,006 --> 00:31:11,440
(Connie)
But what if this story was true?

257
00:31:13,247 --> 00:31:16,956
One night in research
I saw something, George.

258
00:31:17,086 --> 00:31:20,442
There was our friend Polyakov
at a May day parade in Berlin

259
00:31:20,566 --> 00:31:23,035
receiving a salute.

260
00:31:23,167 --> 00:31:25,840
(Smiley) Why would you salute
a cultural attaché?

261
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:29,517
(Connie) Exactly.
Unless he was a war veteran himself.

262
00:31:29,648 --> 00:31:33,242
And if he was, why hide the fact?

263
00:31:33,367 --> 00:31:34,924
What did you do?

264
00:31:35,046 --> 00:31:37,560
I went straight to Esterhase and Alleline.

265
00:31:38,607 --> 00:31:40,757
Here.

266
00:31:40,887 --> 00:31:44,119
Polyakov is a Karla-trained hood
if ever I saw one.

267
00:31:44,248 --> 00:31:46,282
If he's here, it must be
because he's running a mole.

268
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:48,397
You're to leave Polyakov alone.

269
00:31:48,526 --> 00:31:50,563
You're becoming obsessed with him.

270
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:56,486
- You're losing your sense of proportion.
- But that's ridiculous.

271
00:31:56,608 --> 00:31:59,598
Perhaps it's time
you went out into the real world.

272
00:32:11,688 --> 00:32:15,440
(Connie) What does it matter?
Old Circus is gone anyway.

273
00:32:31,527 --> 00:32:33,484
Here we are.

274
00:32:33,608 --> 00:32:35,599
The Nursery in our day.

275
00:32:37,649 --> 00:32:39,526
Jim Prideaux.

276
00:32:39,649 --> 00:32:43,084
And Bill Haydon.
Together, of course.

277
00:32:43,887 --> 00:32:45,479
The Inseparables.

278
00:32:48,608 --> 00:32:50,564
There's Control himself.

279
00:32:51,648 --> 00:32:53,241
All my boys.

280
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:57,162
All my lovely boys.

281
00:32:59,848 --> 00:33:01,998
That was a good time, George.

282
00:33:03,368 --> 00:33:05,485
It was the war, Connie.

283
00:33:08,327 --> 00:33:10,478
A real war.

284
00:33:10,608 --> 00:33:12,678
Englishmen could be proud then.

285
00:33:19,969 --> 00:33:22,322
So I was right, then?

286
00:33:22,447 --> 00:33:24,677
About Polyakov.

287
00:33:24,807 --> 00:33:26,560
There is a mole.

288
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:35,284
If it's bad, don't come back.
I want to remember you all as you were.

289
00:33:37,888 --> 00:33:40,561
(♪ Rock music)

290
00:33:40,688 --> 00:33:44,443
Percy?
Percy, did you mix this?

291
00:33:45,529 --> 00:33:47,327
Aye, I did so.

292
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,963
You Calvinistic, penny-pinching Scot.

293
00:33:51,088 --> 00:33:54,125
(Scottish accent) Can you nae learn
to take a bloody order?

294
00:33:54,248 --> 00:33:57,240
Nobody tampers with the recipe!

295
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,087
- I followed the recipe.
- Come on.

296
00:33:59,209 --> 00:34:02,246

Yes.

00:37:03,132 --> 00:37:04,564
October 21.

323
00:37:05,571 --> 00:37:09,325
So why was someone giving him
£1,000 two months later?

324
00:37:12,132 --> 00:37:14,123
I wonder where he is then, sir.

325
00:37:14,252 --> 00:37:15,845
(Gunshot)

326
00:37:32,571 --> 00:37:34,960
(Children shouting)

327
00:37:38,092 --> 00:37:40,287
(Grunting)

328
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:44,006
Settle down now.

329
00:37:51,772 --> 00:37:53,923
- Hand those out.
- Sir.

330
00:37:54,053 --> 00:37:55,850
(Boy) What is it?
The Hunchback of Notre-Dame?

331
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:57,485
(Giggling)

332
00:37:57,612 --> 00:37:59,808
(Groans)

333
00:37:59,931 --> 00:38:02,365
The bells, the bells!

334
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:10,683
(Squawking)

335
00:38:14,532 --> 00:38:16,523
(Flapping and squawking)

336
00:38:16,652 --> 00:38:17,880
(Gasps)

337
00:38:20,373 --> 00:38:22,170
(Screeching)

338
00:38:22,293 --> 00:38:23,851
(Tweeting)

339
00:38:26,334 --> 00:38:28,209
- (Bones crack)
- Ohh!

340
00:38:41,692 --> 00:38:42,966
Come here.

341
00:38:47,373 --> 00:38:50,524
- What's your name?
- Roach. Bill Roach, sir.

342
00:38:50,653 --> 00:38:53,168
- I'm a new boy.
- New arrival, eh?

343
00:38:53,294 --> 00:38:56,284
- What's the story?
- My mother and father.

344
00:38:57,453 --> 00:39:00,206
My father left, so...

345
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:01,607
Hm.

346
00:39:03,254 --> 00:39:05,051
Bill.

347
00:39:05,174 --> 00:39:06,811
The unpaid Bill.

348
00:39:08,254 --> 00:39:11,164
- Anyone ever call you that?
- No, sir.

349
00:39:11,292 --> 00:39:13,284
Known a lot of Bills in my time.

350
00:39:15,293 --> 00:39:17,329
They've all been good 'uns.

351
00:39:19,574 --> 00:39:21,246
What are you good at?

352
00:39:21,374 --> 00:39:22,853
Nothing, sir.

353
00:39:22,974 --> 00:39:25,692
You're a good watcher, though, eh?

354
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:28,211
Us loners always are.

355
00:39:33,654 --> 00:39:36,328
Best watcher in the unit,
Bill Roach is, I'll bet.

356
00:39:37,653 --> 00:39:40,929
- Long as he's got his specs on. Right?
- Yes, sir.

357
00:39:42,253 --> 00:39:44,244
This is good, very good.

358
00:41:05,855 --> 00:41:07,334
Hello, Ricki.

359
00:41:14,574 --> 00:41:16,486
You've missed the wedge.

360
00:41:23,576 --> 00:41:25,611
Where have you been, Ricki?

361
00:41:28,176 --> 00:41:30,165
They're going to kill me.

362
00:41:32,335 --> 00:41:34,610
- Who is?
- Your lot.

363
00:41:34,735 --> 00:41:36,966
Or their lot.
Whoever gets me first.

364
00:41:39,696 --> 00:41:41,971
I'm innocent.

365
00:41:42,096 --> 00:41:43,528
Within reason.

366
00:41:45,335 --> 00:41:47,132
How long have you been here?

367
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:50,054
Sorry, I've run out of places now.

368
00:41:50,176 --> 00:41:52,007
I needed to see you.

369
00:41:52,897 --> 00:41:54,296
Why?

370
00:41:56,135 --> 00:41:58,012
There's a woman.

371
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:02,805
I need you to trade for her.
I need you to get her back off Karla.

372
00:42:05,976 --> 00:42:07,534
A woman?

373
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,130
Her name's Irina.

374
00:42:12,255 --> 00:42:13,608
(Ship's horn)

375
00:42:15,896 --> 00:42:17,966
(Tarr) This was last November.

376
00:42:18,096 --> 00:42:22,727
Mr. Guillam sent me to Istanbul
to check out a Russian trade delegate

377
00:42:22,857 --> 00:42:24,686
who might be persuaded to defect.

378
00:42:24,815 --> 00:42:27,535
- (Smiley) Tufty Thesinger, resident.
- Yeah.

379
00:42:27,656 --> 00:42:29,055
- Hiya, Ricki.
- All right, mate?

380
00:42:29,176 --> 00:42:32,647
(Tarr) Did you know him?
(Smiley) No, never met him.

381
00:42:32,777 --> 00:42:34,414
(Tarr) Bit of a drinker.

382
00:42:34,536 --> 00:42:36,050
Hangover from hell.

383
00:42:36,177 --> 00:42:38,166
Bit of a fucking idiot.

384
00:42:40,415 --> 00:42:42,247
Apparently this Russian,
name of Boris,

385
00:42:42,376 --> 00:42:44,685
was spending high and wide
in the nightclubs.

386
00:42:44,816 --> 00:42:47,285
(Smiley) So you were sent
to persuade this Boris?

387
00:42:47,417 --> 00:42:50,648
(Tarr) Yeah.
He was your typical Russian.

388
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:53,768
Trade delegation by day,
out boozing every night.

389
00:42:53,896 --> 00:42:55,693
Didn't seem to sleep.

390
00:42:55,816 --> 00:42:57,853
Tufty was worn out
from following him around.

391
00:42:57,977 --> 00:43:00,730
I think it's going to be
a long night, son.

392
00:43:00,857 --> 00:43:03,531
(Tarr) His favourite haunt
was this club in Taksim.

393
00:43:03,658 --> 00:43:07,969
It had a hellhole in the basement
where the sailors and the tourists went.

394
00:43:09,456 --> 00:43:13,416
Anyway, I took one look at him
and I knew I'd wasted a journey.

395
00:43:15,537 --> 00:43:17,175
Boris was no delegate.

396
00:43:18,538 --> 00:43:22,006
What delegate bothers
to play drunker than he really is?

397
00:43:23,256 --> 00:43:26,010
You get to recognise your own,
don't you, Mr. Smiley?

398
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:27,809
And Boris was a hood.

399
00:43:27,937 --> 00:43:29,451
(♪ BLOOD, SWEAT & TEARS:
Spinning Wheel)

400
00:43:29,578 --> 00:43:31,614
Moscow Centre trained.

401
00:43:31,738 --> 00:43:34,125
♪ Someone is waiting

402
00:43:34,256 --> 00:43:35,975

405
00:43:41,858 --> 00:43:44,451
I guessed he was waiting
for a connect.

406
00:43:46,178 --> 00:43:48,406
Working a letterbox, maybe.

407
00:43:48,536 --> 00:43:52,928
Or trailing his coat and looking
for a pass from some mug like me.

408
00:43:53,057 --> 00:43:56,130
So the second night
I went to the import/export outfit

409
00:43:56,258 --> 00:44:00,695
that Tufty had set up with
a cipher room hidden in the back.

410
00:44:00,818 --> 00:44:03,775
I cabled No sale to Mr. Guillam.

411
00:44:04,857 --> 00:44:06,769
And that was that.

412
00:44:08,218 --> 00:44:10,288
(Smiley) You were due
to fly home the next day.

413
00:44:10,418 --> 00:44:11,818
Yes.

414
00:44:13,699 --> 00:44:15,369
But you didn't.

415
00:44:28,339 --> 00:44:30,453
(Tarr) Boris had a wife.

416
00:44:30,577 --> 00:44:31,976
Common-law.

417
00:44:32,817 --> 00:44:36,731
Apparently she was a member
of the delegation in her own right.

418
00:45:32,299 --> 00:45:35,769
You once told me to trust my instincts
about women, Mr. Smiley.

419
00:45:37,059 --> 00:45:40,368
Well, my instincts told me
this woman had some treasure.

420
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:48,651
When Boris went out for the night,
I found myself going into her hotel.

421
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,577
(Smiley) So you dropped Boris.

422
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,896
(Tarr) I know.
It was breaking protocol.

423
00:45:55,299 --> 00:45:59,054
But I was acting on my own initiative,
as it were.

424
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:02,013
Your man's a bit of a bastard, isn't he?

425
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:05,132
I just wanted to make sure
you were all right, OK?

426
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:07,294
(Smiley) So you didn't come home?

427
00:46:08,538 --> 00:46:11,292
I would have.

428
00:46:11,419 --> 00:46:13,455
Boris was a dead end, but...

429
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,819
Um...

430
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:18,728
I could...

431
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,777
I could sense something in her.

432
00:46:23,979 --> 00:46:26,130
A secret.

433
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:31,460
And how did you intend
to get this secret out of her?

434
00:46:38,499 --> 00:46:41,332
(Tarr) I played this businessman,
Michael Trench.

435
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:47,173
Holiday romance.

436
00:46:47,301 --> 00:46:48,891
(She laughs)

437
00:46:51,019 --> 00:46:53,488
I thought I'd take my time with it.

438
00:47:42,262 --> 00:47:44,410
I know who you are.

439
00:47:46,181 --> 00:47:49,058
I want to talk to your boss.

440
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:50,738
Control.

441
00:47:53,301 --> 00:47:55,735
I have something to trade.

442
00:47:55,861 --> 00:47:57,373
Something big.

443
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,974
I want a new life in the West.

444
00:48:02,541 --> 00:48:04,532
That's the deal.

445
00:48:06,862 --> 00:48:08,659
You tell them.

446
00:48:17,181 --> 00:48:20,731
Look, you can't expect them
to jump at every offer of service.

447
00:48:24,102 --> 00:48:27,854
If you won't tell me more,
there is nothing I can do.

448
00:48:33,261 --> 00:48:35,901
If I tell you everything,

449
00:48:36,022 --> 00:48:37,853
I'm putting my life in your hands.

450
00:48:40,101 --> 00:48:42,092
And the lives of other people.

451
00:49:41,102 --> 00:49:43,901
(Tarr) So she told me
what she had to trade.

452
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:47,494
Her secret.

453
00:49:47,623 --> 00:49:49,852
I mean,

454
00:49:49,982 --> 00:49:52,052
the mother of all secrets.

455
00:49:55,103 --> 00:49:57,492
I told her I'd alert the Circus.

456
00:49:57,623 --> 00:50:01,060
She made me promise I wouldn.
give any of the details to London.

457
00:50:01,184 --> 00:50:03,980
(Smiley) And you agreed?
(Tarr) Yes.

458
00:50:05,223 --> 00:50:06,780
I mean it was...

459
00:50:06,902 --> 00:50:10,054
I couldn't believe
I'd got hold of something this big.

460
00:50:10,183 --> 00:50:12,856
I went back to the import/export,

461
00:50:12,983 --> 00:50:16,861
sent the message to the Circus,
graded, Flash, highest priority,

462
00:50:16,982 --> 00:50:20,099
just that I had a Moscow-trained hood
wanting to defect.

463
00:50:20,222 --> 00:50:24,853
You're supposed to have gone.
London stations have been on to me.

464
00:50:24,983 --> 00:50:27,179
Want to know what the hell you're doing.

465
00:50:31,863 --> 00:50:33,376
Fuck off.

466
00:50:34,583 --> 00:50:36,461
(Smiley) Anything else, Ricki?

467
00:50:40,743 --> 00:50:43,497
I know what I am to the Circus.
I'm one of the scalp-hunters,

468
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:46,420
someone that you can hand
your dirty little jobs to.

469
00:50:49,863 --> 00:50:51,342
I just...

470
00:50:52,904 --> 00:50:55,498
I just wanted to bring
this one in myself.

471
00:50:55,624 --> 00:50:57,853
Well, I understand how you felt.

472
00:50:59,983 --> 00:51:02,178
You wanted to do something.

473
00:51:02,303 --> 00:51:04,499
I said that she claimed
to have information

474
00:51:04,624 --> 00:51:07,457
vital to the safeguarding of the Circus.

475
00:51:10,545 --> 00:51:12,181
Anything more?

476
00:51:24,144 --> 00:51:27,692
I said that she had information
concerning a double agent.

477
00:51:30,824 --> 00:51:35,022
Look, I just wanted to get
the proper attention. And I'd...

478
00:51:35,144 --> 00:51:36,624
(Tarr sighs)

479
00:51:36,745 --> 00:51:38,940
I told them this was the reason
why I had not come home.

480
00:51:39,065 --> 00:51:41,259
It wasn't that I'd defected or anything.

481
00:51:42,824 --> 00:51:45,861
- What did you do then?
- I waited for a reply.

482
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:54,342
(Tarr) I hung around for hours.
I heard the Imsak call to prayer.

483
00:51:54,463 --> 00:51:58,173
So what's that?
That's about 3.30 in the morning.

484
00:51:58,304 --> 00:52:00,534
(Clicking)

485
00:52:00,664 --> 00:52:02,383
Then the message comes through.

486
00:52:06,225 --> 00:52:08,419
'We read you.

487
00:52:10,104 --> 00:52:12,538
That was all they sent. Nothing.

488
00:52:13,425 --> 00:52:16,861
It didn't make sense.
It was like they were stalling.

489
00:52:23,305 --> 00:52:25,135
(Smiley) Then what happened?

490
00:52:25,264 --> 00:52:28,097
(Tarr) Then, all of a sudden...

491
00:52:29,745 --> 00:52:32,100
the Russians begin to move.

492
00:52:33,305 --> 00:52:35,613
(♪ Music on radio)

493

(Music stops)

494
00:53:04,104 --> 00:53:07,859
It was nice work.
I couldn't have done it better myself.

495
00:53:07,985 --> 00:53:09,384
(Flies buzz)

496
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:17,853
(Tarr) The message was quite clear.
I needed to warn her.

497
00:53:53,266 --> 00:53:54,780
(Phone rings)

498
00:54:12,305 --> 00:54:14,102
Come on, come on, come on.

499
00:54:28,746 --> 00:54:30,862
(Tarr) I couldn't find her at the airport.

500
00:54:30,986 --> 00:54:33,706
I even looked through
all the flight lists and...

501
00:54:35,427 --> 00:54:37,020
I headed down to the harbour.

502
00:54:47,747 --> 00:54:49,783
They put her on a ship to Odessa.

503
00:54:51,987 --> 00:54:53,785
That's all I know.

504
00:55:03,588 --> 00:55:04,987
I've...

505
00:55:10,027 --> 00:55:13,940
I've done a lot of things in my life,
Mr. Smiley, but...

506
00:55:19,748 --> 00:55:23,182
I just...
I can't stop thinking about her.

507
00:55:27,267 --> 00:55:29,258
She wasn't even my type.

508
00:55:33,308 --> 00:55:35,424
I've got to get her out.
I owe her that.

509
00:55:40,787 --> 00:55:43,860
Karla will be looking for you.

510
00:55:43,988 --> 00:55:46,662
Everybody's looking for me.

511
00:55:49,309 --> 00:55:51,218
You can't stay here.

512
00:55:53,587 --> 00:55:55,145
It isn't safe.

513
00:55:58,148 --> 00:56:01,584
(Haydon) I said, You may fuck me
but you'll call me Sir in the morning.

514
00:56:03,069 --> 00:56:06,901
(Esterhase) OK.
Just need to let you know.

515
00:56:07,027 --> 00:56:10,862
Someone flew into Paris last week
on one of our escaped passports.

516
00:56:10,988 --> 00:56:14,140
- (Haydon) And?
- (Esterhase) It was Ricki Tarr.

517
00:56:15,709 --> 00:56:17,301
(Haydon) Why are you telling me?

518
00:56:17,427 --> 00:56:20,226
- It could be coincidence'...
- (Haydon) You are a poisoned dwarf.

519
00:56:20,348 --> 00:56:21,781
Why don't you fuck off to his Majesty

520

I'm going to have to send you

you can't mention me.

I'm sorry, but you're alone.

- Hm.

Fine. Need to go

OK, sir.

All go smoothly, did it?

642
01:05:45,957 --> 01:05:47,673
I need to go to the hotel
to see George.

643
01:05:47,795 --> 01:05:50,674
Mr. Smiley isn't at the hotel, sir.
Change of venue.

644
01:06:02,076 --> 01:06:03,509
George?

645
01:06:11,518 --> 01:06:13,474
Mr. Guillam...

646
01:06:14,598 --> 01:06:16,507
Sorry it took me so long
to come home.

647
01:06:27,998 --> 01:06:29,987
Ricki has been helping us, Peter.

648
01:06:30,116 --> 01:06:33,075
He's been telling us
all about his adventures.

649
01:06:34,637 --> 01:06:35,990
He's a double, George.

650
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:38,951
There is no mole. Whole thing.
been thought up by Moscow.

651
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:41,194
Karla bought him for ♪30,000.

652
01:06:41,318 --> 01:06:44,070
I stole that because of you.

653
01:06:44,197 --> 01:06:47,667
I spied on my own because of him.
Do you know how that makes me feel?

654
01:06:47,797 --> 01:06:48,992
Ricki...

655
01:06:49,118 --> 01:06:52,554
you said you sent the Circus a telegram
concerning Irina's information.

656
01:06:52,678 --> 01:06:54,555
- That's right.
- What was the date?

657
01:06:54,678 --> 01:06:56,553
He doesn't know
because there was no telegram.

658
01:06:56,676 --> 01:07:00,067
- The whole thing is a fabrication.
- 20th November.

659
01:07:00,197 --> 01:07:03,109
It must have been 20th November.
Evening.

660
01:07:03,237 --> 01:07:05,706
(Tarr on tape) Irina kept telling me
in Moscow Centre...

661
01:07:05,838 --> 01:07:08,227
everybody on the top floor
was laughing themselves sick.

662
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:11,952
- She told me Karla'...
- November 20th is missing.

663
01:07:12,077 --> 01:07:15,912
Someone is covering their tracks,
unless of course you think

664
01:07:16,038 --> 01:07:17,869
that's just a coincidence?

665
01:07:21,799 --> 01:07:23,312
What about the money?

666
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:27,192
30,000 isn't so much for Karla
to pay if it protects his mole.

667
01:07:28,717 --> 01:07:32,347
I'm afraid someone in the Circus
knows all about Mr. Tarr

668
01:07:33,718 --> 01:07:36,278
and is doing everything they can
to discredit him.

669
01:07:36,398 --> 01:07:39,707
(Tarr) Everything the Circus thinks
is gold is shit, made in Moscow.

670
01:07:44,078 --> 01:07:47,958
Why didn't you tell me
that you had Tarr?

671
01:07:52,437 --> 01:07:54,508
In case I never made it
out of the Circus.

672
01:07:55,878 --> 01:07:57,755
I should get some rest.

673
01:07:59,159 --> 01:08:01,434
I suppose you've got your reading to do.

674
01:08:02,838 --> 01:08:04,352
Come up.

675
01:08:15,959 --> 01:08:17,756
I met him once.

676
01:08:19,119 --> 01:08:20,597
Karla.

677
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:23,517
In '55.

678
01:08:26,559 --> 01:08:28,754
Moscow Centre was in pieces.

679
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:33,750
Purge after purge.

680
01:08:33,878 --> 01:08:36,154
Half their agents were jumping ship.

681
01:08:37,558 --> 01:08:39,674
I travelled around, signing them up.

682
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:42,558
Hundreds of them.

683
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:48,797
One of them
was calling himself Gerstmann.

684
01:08:49,678 --> 01:08:51,829
He was on his way back to Russia

685
01:08:51,959 --> 01:08:55,269
and we were pretty sure
he was going to be executed.

686
01:08:55,399 --> 01:08:59,712
Plane had a 24-hour lay-over at Delhi
and that's how long I had

687
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:02,831
to convince him to come over to us

688
01:09:02,959 --> 01:09:04,950
instead of going home to die.

689
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:12,077
There's a little room.

690
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:17,948
I'm sitting here. He's sitting there.

691
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:25,710
The Americans had had him tortured.

692
01:09:29,639 --> 01:09:31,630
He had no fingernails.

693
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,236
It's incredibly hot.

694
01:09:41,441 --> 01:09:45,672
I'm very tired and all I want to do
is get this over with and get back home.

695
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:50,789
Things weren't going well with Ann.

696
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,199
I give him the usual pitch.

697
01:09:56,321 --> 01:10:00,198
Come to the West
and we can give you a comfortable life,

698
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,157
after questioning.

699
01:10:07,001 --> 01:10:08,719
What did he say?

700
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,392
Think of your wife.

701
01:10:18,001 --> 01:10:20,037
You have a wife, don't you?

702
01:10:23,401 --> 01:10:26,197
Here. I brought you some cigarettes,
by the way.

703
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:31,758
Use my lighter.

704
01:10:36,801 --> 01:10:41,749
We could arrange for her to join you.
We have a lot of stock to trade.

705
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:46,752
If you go back, she'll be ostracised.
Think of her.

706
01:10:46,881 --> 01:10:48,519
Think about...

707
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,518
I kept on...

708
01:10:55,841 --> 01:10:58,070
...harping on about the damn wife,

709
01:11:00,481 --> 01:11:02,517
telling him more about me than...

710
01:11:05,962 --> 01:11:07,951
I should have walked out, of course.

711
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:14,279
But for some reason it seemed
important to save this one, so I go on.

712
01:11:17,042 --> 01:11:19,681
We're not so very different
you and I.

713
01:11:21,321 --> 01:11:22,834
We've both spent our lives

714
01:11:22,961 --> 01:11:26,192
looking for the weaknesses
in one another's systems.

715
01:11:29,282 --> 01:11:31,351
Don't you think it's time to recognise

716
01:11:31,481 --> 01:11:35,758
there is as little worth on your side
as there is on mine?

717
01:11:48,321 --> 01:11:50,312
Never said a word.

718
01:11:56,602 --> 01:11:58,354
Not one word.

719
01:12:07,161 --> 01:12:09,756
And the next morning
he got back on his plane.

720
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:13,875
He handed the pack of cigarettes
back to me, untouched.

721
01:12:14,002 --> 01:12:17,880
This was a chain-smoker, mind.

722
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:21,995
And he flew off to what
he presumed would be his death.

723
01:12:25,683 --> 01:12:27,514
He kept my lighter.

724
01:12:31,242 --> 01:12:32,834
It was a gift.

725
01:12:35,042 --> 01:12:37,034
To George from Ann.

726
01:12:39,483 --> 01:12:41,154
All my love.

727
01:12:44,201 --> 01:12:45,793
That was Karla.

728
01:12:47,962 --> 01:12:50,556
He went back to die
rather than giving in.

729
01:12:53,323 --> 01:12:55,962
Yes, and that's how I know
he can be beaten.

730
01:12:59,882 --> 01:13:01,873
Because he's a fanatic.

731
01:13:03,483 --> 01:13:07,078
And the fanatic is always
concealing a secret doubt.

732
01:13:12,642 --> 01:13:14,201
What did he look like?

733
01:13:16,362 --> 01:13:18,239
I can't remember.

734
01:13:38,964 --> 01:13:40,999
After today, Peter,

735
01:13:42,403 --> 01:13:44,758
you have to assume
they're watching you.

736
01:13:50,163 --> 01:13:52,314
If there's anything you need tidied up,

737
01:13:56,643 --> 01:13:58,440
now is the time.

738
01:14:12,324 --> 01:14:13,837
Nearly done.

739
01:14:15,204 --> 01:14:16,842
For God's sake.

740
01:14:20,605 --> 01:14:23,880
Sometimes I think they're all
sharing the same moronic brain.

741
01:14:34,365 --> 01:14:36,638
If there's someone else,
you can tell me.

742
01:14:39,124 --> 01:14:40,842
I'm a grown-up.

743
01:14:56,365 --> 01:14:57,764

746
01:15:20,484 --> 01:15:21,918

760
01:17:11,326 --> 01:17:13,476
I need to talk to you.

761
01:17:13,606 --> 01:17:16,041
About the night Jim Prideaux was killed.

762
01:17:17,687 --> 01:17:19,882
You were duty officer, weren't you?

763
01:17:20,567 --> 01:17:24,319
Yeah. Control asked me
to man the phones that night.

764
01:17:25,366 --> 01:17:28,085
He said someone was doing
a special job for the service.

765
01:17:28,206 --> 01:17:29,924
He wanted someone he could trust.

766

01:18:05,846 --> 01:18:07,565
There's been a bit of a panic, sir.

770
01:18:09,487 --> 01:18:11,921
This is from the FO resident clerk.

771
01:18:12,047 --> 01:18:14,437
A Hungarian news bulletin.

772
01:18:14,568 --> 01:18:16,638
British spy, work name Ellis,

773
01:18:16,768 --> 01:18:18,837
travelling with false Hungarian papers,

774
01:18:18,967 --> 01:18:23,439
has attempted to kidnap an unnamed
Hungarian General in Budapest.

775
01:18:24,528 --> 01:18:26,439
He's been shot.

776
01:18:26,568 --> 01:18:28,558
Other arrests imminent.

777
01:18:28,687 --> 01:18:30,280
(Phones ringing)

778
01:18:32,166 --> 01:18:34,158
Can I have a brief, please?

779
01:18:36,807 --> 01:18:39,241
Sir? Do you want me to deny it, sir?

780
01:18:39,367 --> 01:18:40,721
(Phones ringing)

781
01:18:44,927 --> 01:18:47,282
I must have a brief, sir.

782
01:18:47,407 --> 01:18:49,762
(Jerry) I couldn't get
a word out of Control.

783
01:18:49,887 --> 01:18:52,846
So I followed protocol
and went for the emergency list.

784
01:18:55,969 --> 01:18:57,960
You rang my house.

785
01:18:58,089 --> 01:19:00,476
Just on the off-chance
you were back from Berlin.

786
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:01,961
What did you say?

787
01:19:02,807 --> 01:19:04,843
- Hello?
- Hello, Mrs. Smiley.

788
01:19:04,967 --> 01:19:06,959
It's Jerry.
Jerry Westerby from the office.

789
01:19:07,088 --> 01:19:09,283
Just that there'd been a bit of a crisis.

790
01:19:09,408 --> 01:19:11,399
Ann said you wasn't back yet
and that was it.

791
01:19:12,567 --> 01:19:13,602
Go on.

792
01:19:13,727 --> 01:19:15,206
All hell broke loose.

793

baying at the door.

795

Thank Christ
Bill Haydon turned up when he did.

796
01:19:23,889 --> 01:19:25,038
- Mr. Haydon.
- Not now.

797
01:19:25,169 --> 01:19:26,441
Mr. Haydon!

798
01:19:27,968 --> 01:19:28,923
Out!

799
01:19:30,768 --> 01:19:32,486
- Tell me.
- I tried to get hold of you.

800

on the ticker tape at my club. Tell me.

01:19:36,809 --> 01:19:38,606
Jim Prideaux's been shot.

802
01:19:42,967 --> 01:19:44,799
Get me the Hungarian embassy.

803
01:19:44,928 --> 01:19:46,646
You tell your masters what will happen

804
01:19:46,768 --> 01:19:48,565
if one hair on Jim Prideaux's head
is damaged.

805
01:19:48,688 --> 01:19:51,487
Get Esterhase on the phone.
Tell him to call in the Hungarian agents.

806
01:19:51,609 --> 01:19:52,564
Yes, sir.

807
01:20:04,209 --> 01:20:06,644
Any more news on him? Sir?

808
01:20:11,409 --> 01:20:12,761
Oh, God.

809
01:20:12,888 --> 01:20:15,482
We need to get down to his flat,
clear out anything linked.

810
01:20:56,049 --> 01:20:58,928
(Guillam)
Haydon heard the news at his club?

811
01:20:59,050 --> 01:21:00,278
(Smiley) The Savile.

812
01:21:00,410 --> 01:21:03,208
(Guillam) At 1:30? The ticker-tape
wouldn't have been running.

813
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:04,967
So how did he know?

814
01:21:06,489 --> 01:21:07,922
- Jesus, George.
- Peter!

815
01:21:08,049 --> 01:21:10,484
- How could he have known?
- It's not what you think.

816
01:21:10,610 --> 01:21:14,365
- Then how did he know?
- He was at my house that night.

817
01:21:43,251 --> 01:21:45,242
Good flight?

818
01:21:47,850 --> 01:21:49,681
Yes.

819
01:21:49,810 --> 01:21:51,687
Pleasant enough.

820
01:21:51,811 --> 01:21:53,608
I was just passing.
I thought I'd call in.

821
01:21:54,451 --> 01:21:57,602
Ann was in bed.
She insisted on getting up.

822
01:21:57,731 --> 01:21:59,879
She said she'd be down in a minute.

823
01:22:01,569 --> 01:22:04,960
That's what I'm dropping off.
It's an awful daub really.

824
01:22:06,610 --> 01:22:08,806
But Ann expressed a liking.

825
01:22:11,691 --> 01:22:13,521
What's keeping her?

826
01:22:29,531 --> 01:22:30,883
(Prideaux) Keep going.

827
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:34,001
Come on, lads. Keep up.

828
01:22:36,851 --> 01:22:38,569
Come on, Bill!

829
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:53,692
- Got your specs on, Jumbo?
- Yes, sir.

830
01:22:53,812 --> 01:22:55,402
Come here.

831
01:23:01,612 --> 01:23:03,603
Who's that fellow down there?

832
01:23:05,212 --> 01:23:07,328
I don't know, sir.

833
01:23:07,452 --> 01:23:09,441
Who is he?

834
01:23:09,570 --> 01:23:11,367
Beggar man?

835
01:23:11,490 --> 01:23:12,890
Thief?

836
01:23:14,451 --> 01:23:16,919
Why doesn't he look this way, hm?

837
01:23:17,051 --> 01:23:20,727
Wouldn't you if you saw a bunch
of boys flogging a car round a field?

838
01:23:21,892 --> 01:23:25,122
What's the matter with him?
Doesn't he like us?

839
01:23:25,251 --> 01:23:28,164
I don't hold with odd-bods
hanging around.

840
01:23:28,292 --> 01:23:30,760
He might steal the Alvis.

841
01:23:30,892 --> 01:23:33,122
- Which is?
- The best car in England, sir.

842
01:23:36,571 --> 01:23:38,084
Good lad.

843
01:23:47,092 --> 01:23:50,925
(Smiley) How were you briefed
for the Budapest mission?

844
01:23:51,051 --> 01:23:53,963
(Prideaux) Control asked me
to come to a flat in Kensington.

845
01:23:56,412 --> 01:23:58,972
There's a rotten apple, Jim.

846
01:24:00,893 --> 01:24:02,884
And we have to find it.

847
01:24:04,771 --> 01:24:07,844
What did you make of it, Jim?

848
01:24:07,972 --> 01:24:09,849
Control's theory?

849
01:24:11,333 --> 01:24:13,847
I thought it was madness.

850
01:24:13,973 --> 01:24:18,203
I know that it is one of five men.

851
01:24:19,691 --> 01:24:23,287
All I want from you is one code name.

852
01:24:30,013 --> 01:24:31,412
Alleline.

853
01:24:33,612 --> 01:24:35,125
Tinker.

854
01:24:35,812 --> 01:24:37,211
Haydon.

855
01:24:38,893 --> 01:24:40,406
Tailor.

856
01:24:42,053 --> 01:24:43,453
Bland.

857
01:24:45,894 --> 01:24:47,291
Soldier.

858
01:24:48,693 --> 01:24:51,411
We drop Sailor.
It's too close to Tailor.

859
01:24:51,532 --> 01:24:53,603
And Rich Man doesn't seem
to be applicable.

860
01:24:55,573 --> 01:24:56,972
Esterhase.

861
01:24:58,814 --> 01:25:01,007
Poor Man.

862
01:25:06,213 --> 01:25:07,771
And the fifth?

863
01:25:09,974 --> 01:25:11,407
Smiley.

864
01:25:15,133 --> 01:25:17,124
I thought it was madness.

865
01:25:18,493 --> 01:25:21,486
To think that any one of you
could have been a traitor.

866
01:25:22,974 --> 01:25:24,565
Absolute madness.

867
01:25:26,494 --> 01:25:29,211
(Smiley) But you still went.

868
01:25:29,332 --> 01:25:31,403
Why?

869
01:25:31,533 --> 01:25:34,570
(Prideaux) I went
because Control asked me to go.

870
01:25:34,693 --> 01:25:37,083
It's called doing one's duty.

871
01:25:47,734 --> 01:25:52,411
At the station I met the legman
supposed to take me to the General.

872
01:25:52,535 --> 01:25:54,491
The waiter must have panicked.

873
01:25:54,615 --> 01:25:56,410
It was meant to be
a simple snatch job.

874
01:26:02,894 --> 01:26:05,362
They drove me
to some military hospital,

875
01:26:05,494 --> 01:26:08,167
and then put me on a transport plane.

876
01:26:08,295 --> 01:26:10,488
I could tell by the stars
we were heading east.

877
01:26:14,814 --> 01:26:16,805
Then they worked me for...

878
01:26:16,934 --> 01:26:18,926
(Sighs heavily)

879
01:26:19,055 --> 01:26:21,410
I don't know how long.

880
01:26:21,535 --> 01:26:23,683
Weeks, maybe months.

881
01:26:24,854 --> 01:26:27,766
(Cacophony of sounds
start and stop)

882
01:27:02,416 --> 01:27:04,088
What did you tell them?

883
01:27:05,534 --> 01:27:07,093
Everything.

884
01:27:09,294 --> 01:27:13,049
I held on for as long as I could to let
everyone get the hell out of there.

885
01:27:15,135 --> 01:27:16,534
Did they?

886
01:27:17,655 --> 01:27:20,327
My networks in Hungary,
did they get out?

887
01:27:22,974 --> 01:27:24,966
No, they were blown.

888
01:27:27,095 --> 01:27:30,611
The story is you blew them
to save your own skin.

889
01:27:33,815 --> 01:27:35,407
(Shouting in Russian)

890
01:27:37,855 --> 01:27:42,646
After the interrogators had cleared out,
this little fellow turned up.

891
01:27:44,616 --> 01:27:46,493
Looked like a priest.

892
01:27:47,934 --> 01:27:50,210
That's when they really started on me.

893
01:27:50,335 --> 01:27:53,805
What was your last line of defence, hm?

894
01:27:55,336 --> 01:27:56,928
The mole.

895
01:27:58,256 --> 01:28:00,247
Control's crazy theory.

896
01:28:02,255 --> 01:28:05,645
I was going to bury that so deep
they'd never get it out of me.

897
01:28:07,496 --> 01:28:10,249
- Which was a joke.
- Why?

898
01:28:11,857 --> 01:28:14,132
Because they already knew.

899
01:28:14,257 --> 01:28:17,646
All they wanted to know was how far
Control had got in his investigation.

900
01:28:32,736 --> 01:28:34,488
No, I don't know her.

901
01:28:49,977 --> 01:28:51,615
(Door closes)

902
01:28:54,137 --> 01:28:57,127
Did they ask about me at all?

903
01:28:57,255 --> 01:28:58,654
Yes.

904
01:28:59,656 --> 01:29:01,533
The little fellow did.

905
01:29:03,736 --> 01:29:06,535
What did he say about me?

906
01:29:08,057 --> 01:29:10,172
He had this cigarette lighter.

907
01:29:11,576 --> 01:29:14,170
He kept flashing it about
for me to see it.

908
01:29:15,417 --> 01:29:17,567
Showed me the inscription.

909
01:29:17,697 --> 01:29:19,813
- To George...
- From Ann.

910
01:29:21,218 --> 01:29:22,856
All my love.

911
01:29:28,496 --> 01:29:29,895
Karla.

912
01:29:44,137 --> 01:29:45,490
(Gunshot)

913
01:29:47,338 --> 01:29:49,329
(Baby crying)

914
01:29:59,458 --> 01:30:01,449
(Prideaux) It was odd.

915
01:30:02,857 --> 01:30:05,326
They sent me back to England.

916
01:30:05,456 --> 01:30:07,890
Straight to Sarratt for debriefing.

917
01:30:10,617 --> 01:30:15,408
He said when he was being debriefed
at the Nursery, he had a visitor.

918
01:30:15,538 --> 01:30:16,607
Who?

919
01:30:16,738 --> 01:30:19,535
(Smiley) Toby Esterhase.

920
01:30:19,657 --> 01:30:22,217
He gave him £1,000 and an Alvis.

921
01:30:23,217 --> 01:30:26,415
Told him he was dead now.
Couldn't come back.

922
01:30:26,538 --> 01:30:29,848
Had to become a lotus eater,
forget everything that happened.

923
01:30:29,978 --> 01:30:31,776
Control's theory.

924
01:30:31,899 --> 01:30:34,013
Tinker, Tailor. All of it.

925
01:30:35,418 --> 01:30:37,931
Yes, that's what I thought.

926
01:30:38,057 --> 01:30:42,176
How on earth did Esterhase
hear about Tinker, Tailor?

927
01:30:58,099 --> 01:31:00,215
(Tarr on tape) Irina kept telling me
in Moscow Centre...

928
01:31:00,339 --> 01:31:03,535
everybody on the top floor
was laughing themselves sick.

929
01:31:03,658 --> 01:31:05,967
She told me
Karla was very proud of this.

930
01:31:06,098 --> 01:31:09,171
She said everything the Circus thinks
is gold is shit, made in Moscow.

931
01:31:14,579 --> 01:31:16,613
Irina kept telling me
in Moscow Centre...

932
01:31:16,737 --> 01:31:19,536
everybody on the top floor
was laughing themselves sick.

933
01:31:19,658 --> 01:31:22,695
No, I had a hotel nearby.
They do have some seedy rooms.

934
01:31:22,818 --> 01:31:24,775
Irina kept telling me in Moscow Centre

935
01:31:24,899 --> 01:31:28,289
everybody on the top floor
was laughing themselves sick.

936
01:31:28,419 --> 01:31:30,295
She told me
Karla was very proud of this'...

937
01:31:30,418 --> 01:31:35,334
(Tape recording on a loop)

938
01:32:05,419 --> 01:32:07,729
She said everything
the Circus thinks is gold is shit.

939
01:32:07,860 --> 01:32:09,657
(Stops tape)

940
01:32:36,780 --> 01:32:39,851
This meeting is not taking place.
Is that clear?

941
01:32:40,979 --> 01:32:42,537
Perfectly, Minister.

942
01:32:47,180 --> 01:32:52,016
There is a house
somewhere in this city

943
01:32:53,059 --> 01:32:56,654
where Alleline and the others meet
Witchcraft's London representative.

944
01:32:56,779 --> 01:32:58,815
I thought Lacon had made it
clear to you.

945
01:32:58,939 --> 01:33:02,410
Keep your nose bloody well
out of Witchcraft's business.

946
01:33:02,540 --> 01:33:04,292
It's Lacon's advice I'm following.

947
01:33:04,420 --> 01:33:06,887
You told me
to follow in Control's footsteps.

948
01:33:07,019 --> 01:33:11,491
I wouldn't consider that sound advice,
given the mess Control left us with.

949
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:16,620
It has taken Alleline
and, if I may say so, myself

950
01:33:16,741 --> 01:33:18,697
this long to get us back in the game.

951
01:33:19,821 --> 01:33:23,608
The man Alleline and the others
meet is called Polyakov.

952
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:28,774
You believe his role
is to bring information

953
01:33:28,901 --> 01:33:30,891
from Witchcraft to you.

954
01:33:31,020 --> 01:33:35,695
His real role is to receive
information from the mole

955
01:33:35,819 --> 01:33:37,333
to take back to Karla.

956
01:33:38,660 --> 01:33:41,891
That, er...
That's not possible.

957
01:33:42,020 --> 01:33:43,613
Made possible.

958
01:33:43,741 --> 01:33:47,017
By you in the house you persuaded
the Treasury to pay for.

959
01:33:47,860 --> 01:33:52,854
Witchcraft's intelligence is genuine.
It's been gold.

960
01:33:52,980 --> 01:33:57,099
It's just enough glitter
amongst the chicken feed.

961
01:33:57,221 --> 01:33:59,975
Control didn't believe in miracles
or in Witchcraft.

962
01:34:00,102 --> 01:34:01,818
But you were lazy and greedy

963
01:34:01,940 --> 01:34:05,819
and so you hounded him
out of the Circus and you let Karla in.

964
01:34:08,420 --> 01:34:12,460
You opened negotiations to exchange
intelligence with the Americans.

965
01:34:12,581 --> 01:34:16,095
What they tell the Circus,
they'll be telling the Kremlin.

966
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:21,454
Witchcraft's information,
the gold Karla let you have,

967
01:34:21,581 --> 01:34:23,617
it wasn't to lure you.

968
01:34:23,741 --> 01:34:25,937
It was to lure the Americans.

969
01:34:27,982 --> 01:34:29,652
Now,

970
01:34:29,780 --> 01:34:31,772
do you want to take credit for that?

971
01:34:36,102 --> 01:34:37,899
What can we do?

972
01:34:40,221 --> 01:34:43,849
We have one thing the mole wants.

973
01:34:46,941 --> 01:34:48,215
- If I go to Paris...
- You'll go.

974
01:34:48,341 --> 01:34:51,014
If I go to Paris,

975
01:34:52,702 --> 01:34:55,091
I want your word
that you will get Irina back.

976
01:34:56,582 --> 01:35:00,017
I don't care who you have to trade.
And I am out.

977
01:35:02,461 --> 01:35:06,535
I want a family, thank you.
I do not want to end up like you lot.

978
01:35:06,662 --> 01:35:08,893
You will get her back.

979
01:35:11,661 --> 01:35:14,051
I'll do my utmost, Ricki.

980
01:35:15,741 --> 01:35:17,538
(Metallic clanging)

981
01:35:38,063 --> 01:35:40,053
Oh, hello, George.

982
01:35:41,182 --> 01:35:42,581
Hello.

983
01:36:07,462 --> 01:36:09,771
I want to talk about loyalty, Toby.

984
01:36:12,663 --> 01:36:15,541
Control recruited you, didn't he?

985
01:36:15,663 --> 01:36:18,701
Found you starving
in a museum in Vienna.

986
01:36:18,824 --> 01:36:21,211
A wanted man.

987
01:36:21,342 --> 01:36:23,334
Saved your life, I heard.

988
01:36:24,422 --> 01:36:26,492
And yet when the time came,

989
01:36:26,622 --> 01:36:28,898
when it came to picking sides
between him and Alleline,

990
01:36:29,023 --> 01:36:30,900
you didn't hesitate.

991
01:36:31,903 --> 01:36:35,497
That's understandable, perhaps,
with your war experience.

992
01:36:35,622 --> 01:36:40,174
You survived this long, I suppose,
because of your ability to change sides.

993
01:36:40,303 --> 01:36:42,294
Serve any master.

994
01:36:47,704 --> 01:36:50,297
What? What's...
What's this about, George?

995
01:36:51,343 --> 01:36:54,460
It's about which master
you've been serving, Toby.

996
01:36:58,304 --> 01:37:00,772
(Smiley) Intelligence
has been leaked, Toby.

997
01:37:00,904 --> 01:37:03,655
Someone's been taking files
from the Circus.

998
01:37:03,782 --> 01:37:05,933
(Esterhase) No, no, no, no. No.

999
01:37:06,063 --> 01:37:07,735
This is a mistake, a misunderstanding.

1000
01:37:07,863 --> 01:37:11,140
Files were delivered
to a Russian attaché, weren't they?

1001
01:37:11,264 --> 01:37:12,379
Yes.

1002
01:37:14,144 --> 01:37:16,737
(Esterhase) And, yes, I delivered them.

1003
01:37:16,863 --> 01:37:19,502
(Speaks Russian)

1004
01:37:22,024 --> 01:37:24,219
But so did Percy Alleline.

1005
01:37:28,905 --> 01:37:30,131
Good boy.

1006
01:37:30,263 --> 01:37:32,255
(Esterhase) Bill Haydon.

1007
01:37:33,943 --> 01:37:35,934
And so did Roy Bland.

1008
01:37:45,343 --> 01:37:47,732
Things aren't always
what they seem, George.

1009
01:37:47,863 --> 01:37:49,741
You should know that.

1010
01:37:49,864 --> 01:37:52,219
Look, Moscow thinks Polyakov's...

1011
01:37:56,265 --> 01:37:58,174
...working for them.

1012
01:37:58,303 --> 01:38:00,738
Every now and then we give him
the odd file to take back to them.

1013
01:38:00,864 --> 01:38:03,173
Chicken feed,
just to keep his bosses happy.

1014
01:38:05,505 --> 01:38:08,621
But Polyakov's our Joe.

1015
01:38:08,744 --> 01:38:12,292
- He's a part of a big operation.
- Operation Witchcraft.

1016
01:38:13,223 --> 01:38:14,656
Yes, I know.

1017
01:38:15,624 --> 01:38:17,216
George.

1018
01:38:17,344 --> 01:38:20,063
- Please, I don't deserve this.
- Who gave you the message

1019
01:38:20,185 --> 01:38:22,779
for Jim Prideaux
to forget about Tinker, Tailor?

1020
01:38:22,905 --> 01:38:25,100
- Bland.
- To get rid of Connie Sachs?

1021
01:38:25,225 --> 01:38:26,896
- Westerby?
- Bland.

1022
01:38:27,024 --> 01:38:29,140
Or Haydon.

1023
01:38:29,264 --> 01:38:30,983
I don't know. One of them.

1024
01:38:32,185 --> 01:38:33,982
Or maybe Percy. No.

1025
01:38:34,105 --> 01:38:36,700
Well, I don't know who.

1026
01:38:36,826 --> 01:38:38,942
You're just the messenger.

1027
01:38:39,984 --> 01:38:42,499
Running between them all.

1028
01:38:42,625 --> 01:38:44,979
Anything to serve Witchcraft.

1029
01:38:46,224 --> 01:38:48,500
I know all about your secret source.

1030
01:38:50,185 --> 01:38:52,176
And I know something you don't.

1031
01:38:54,104 --> 01:38:56,174
I know who he is.

1032
01:38:58,465 --> 01:39:00,456
He's Karla.

1033
01:39:01,225 --> 01:39:04,457
(Plane engine revs)

1034
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:12,103
(Smiley) One of you has been giving
Polyakov the crown jewels.

1035
01:39:12,225 --> 01:39:15,263
- I did not know.
- Are you still a wanted man, Toby?

1036
01:39:15,386 --> 01:39:19,095
- Look, George, I didn't know. I...
- You picked the wrong side.

1037
01:39:19,226 --> 01:39:21,023
No, you've got to believe me.

1038
01:39:21,144 --> 01:39:23,374
George, please.

1039
01:39:27,345 --> 01:39:29,415
I am loyal.

1040
01:39:30,146 --> 01:39:32,376
I... I am loyal.

1041
01:39:42,986 --> 01:39:45,341
Don't... Don't...
Don't send me back.

1042
01:39:45,466 --> 01:39:47,264
Please, George.

1043
01:39:48,107 --> 01:39:49,777
Don't send me back.

1044
01:39:55,065 --> 01:39:57,057
Give me the address.

1045
01:40:00,146 --> 01:40:02,456
Where do you meet Polyakov?

1046
01:40:12,947 --> 01:40:14,096
(Radio on)

1047
01:40:14,227 --> 01:40:15,342
(Knocking)

1048
01:40:15,467 --> 01:40:17,695
Hey, hey!
Dog, dog, be quiet!

1049
01:40:18,786 --> 01:40:21,459
What is this? Who are you?

1050
01:40:21,586 --> 01:40:23,384
- Mrs. McCraig?
- Yes.

1051
01:40:38,466 --> 01:40:40,776
- What are the safety signals?
- The air vent.

1052
01:40:40,907 --> 01:40:43,216
Open and all's well,
closed and you're not to enter.

1053
01:40:46,626 --> 01:40:48,821
And the microphone?

1054
01:40:55,468 --> 01:40:56,787
Peter?

1055
01:41:12,706 --> 01:41:15,584
The boy stood on the burning deck
whence all but he had fled

1056
01:41:15,706 --> 01:41:18,016
The flame that lit the battle's wreck
shone brightly o'er the dead

1057
01:41:18,947 --> 01:41:22,224
(Tape) Beautiful and proud he stood
as born to rule the storm

1058
01:41:22,348 --> 01:41:25,465
A creature of blood,
a proud though child-like form

1059
01:41:25,588 --> 01:41:28,147
- The flames rolled on...
- (Knocking)

1060
01:41:30,587 --> 01:41:32,897
(Bells chime)

1061
01:41:38,868 --> 01:41:41,664
Merci. Au revoir.

1062
01:42:02,708 --> 01:42:05,507
(Speak French)

1063
01:42:13,467 --> 01:42:14,946
Go on.

1064
01:42:22,547 --> 01:42:24,458
The whole service is looking for you.

1065
01:42:24,587 --> 01:42:27,819
- They'll skin you alive if they find you.
- Maybe I want them to find me.

1066
01:42:29,468 --> 01:42:32,541
You can go now. Leave the books
and put the keys in the machines.

1067
01:42:32,669 --> 01:42:35,183
No, Ben stays here.

1068
01:42:35,309 --> 01:42:40,462
Ricki Tarr claims to have information
vital to the safeguarding of the Circus.

1069
01:43:01,829 --> 01:43:03,625
(Mendel) Mr. Smiley?

1070
01:43:06,028 --> 01:43:07,381
Taxi approaching Circus.

1071
01:43:19,268 --> 01:43:20,668
Tinker.

1072
01:43:31,110 --> 01:43:32,826
Tailor.

1073
01:43:37,909 --> 01:43:39,581
Here comes Soldier.

1074
01:43:44,150 --> 01:43:45,706
Full house.

1075
01:43:57,990 --> 01:44:03,541
- Well, go on then. Read it out loud.
- Personal for Tarr from Alleline.

1076
01:44:04,629 --> 01:44:08,828
Require clarification
before meeting your request.

1077
01:44:09,830 --> 01:44:15,665
Quote, information vital to safeguarding
of the Circus, unquote...

1078
01:44:16,909 --> 01:44:20,983
does not qualify,
send further information.

1079
01:44:21,110 --> 01:44:24,103
Ah! That's it, Percy,
you keep stalling.

1080
01:44:24,231 --> 01:44:26,948
I warn you, Ben. We've got
some really lousy people in this outfit.

1081
01:44:27,069 --> 01:44:29,186
I wouldn't trust a fucking one of them.

1082
01:44:36,750 --> 01:44:38,866
(Mendel) The meeting's over.

1083
01:44:41,189 --> 01:44:43,020
They're leaving.

1084
01:45:04,431 --> 01:45:06,387
(Car approaches and stops)

1085
01:45:06,511 --> 01:45:08,229
(Car door slams)

1086
01:45:12,950 --> 01:45:15,510
(Footsteps)

1087
01:45:15,630 --> 01:45:16,665
(Door closes)

1088
01:45:16,790 --> 01:45:18,622
(Footsteps)

1089
01:48:34,513 --> 01:48:36,630
Craddox says I'll be off in a few days.

1090
01:48:38,352 --> 01:48:41,948
I keep thinking how much
I'm going to miss the cricket in Moscow.

1091
01:48:48,394 --> 01:48:52,671
I was rather hoping you might do
a little light housekeeping for me.

1092
01:48:54,393 --> 01:48:55,986
If I can.

1093
01:48:56,714 --> 01:49:01,105
There's a girl.
Give her some money, would you?

1094
01:49:01,234 --> 01:49:03,351
And give her a good cover story.

1095
01:49:05,513 --> 01:49:08,186
If it helps, tell her I love her.

1096
01:49:08,313 --> 01:49:09,985
It's all there.

1097
01:49:10,113 --> 01:49:13,993
And there's a boy, too.
Slip him a few quid to shut him up.

1098
01:49:16,234 --> 01:49:20,112
I know the inquisitors' bag of tricks.
I taught most of them.

1099
01:49:22,674 --> 01:49:24,665
It's just a reaction.

1100
01:49:26,514 --> 01:49:28,949
An over-reaction, if you like.

1101
01:49:29,075 --> 01:49:31,635
I did have one or two questions.

1102
01:49:35,354 --> 01:49:37,151
- About Prideaux.
- Goddamn it!

1103
01:49:37,274 --> 01:49:40,073
- I got him back, didn't i?
- Yes, yes, you did.

1104
01:49:40,195 --> 01:49:42,072
That was good of you.

1105
01:49:43,114 --> 01:49:46,230
I am surprised
Karla didn't have him shot.

1106
01:49:47,713 --> 01:49:50,353
Or do you think he held back,

1107
01:49:50,474 --> 01:49:52,942
out of delicacy towards you?

1108
01:49:56,475 --> 01:50:00,911
Did Prideaux come and see you
before he left on the Hungarian mission?

1109
01:50:03,314 --> 01:50:05,590
Yes, as a matter of fact he did.

1110
01:50:08,115 --> 01:50:10,071
To say what?

1111
01:50:15,314 --> 01:50:17,112
To warn you.

1112
01:50:18,954 --> 01:50:21,422
Because he knew deep down

1113
01:50:22,595 --> 01:50:24,426
it was you all along.

1114
01:50:28,794 --> 01:50:30,989
So did you.

1115
01:50:34,835 --> 01:50:37,144
I had to pick a side, George.

1116
01:50:38,756 --> 01:50:41,905
It was an aesthetic choice
as much as a moral one.

1117
01:50:43,235 --> 01:50:46,147
And the West has become
so very ugly.

1118
01:50:47,275 --> 01:50:48,914
Don't you think?

1119
01:50:50,556 --> 01:50:53,992
Did Karla ever consider
having you take over the Circus?

1120
01:50:54,116 --> 01:50:56,344
I'm not his bloody office boy!

1121
01:50:56,474 --> 01:50:58,864
What are you, then, Bill?

1122
01:51:05,236 --> 01:51:07,431
I'm someone who's made his mark.

1123
01:51:20,597 --> 01:51:25,066
Is there anything particular
you want me to pass on to Ann?

1124
01:51:28,675 --> 01:51:33,033
Oh, that was nothing personal, George.
I hope you understand that.

1125
01:51:33,156 --> 01:51:35,351
Karla said you were good,

1126
01:51:35,476 --> 01:51:38,512
the one we had to worry about.

1127
01:51:38,635 --> 01:51:41,946
But you do have a blind spot.

1128
01:51:42,076 --> 01:51:44,351
He reckoned
if I was known to be Ann's lover,

1129
01:51:45,676 --> 01:51:48,555
you wouldn't be able to see me straight.

1130
01:51:50,077 --> 01:51:51,872
And he was right.

1131
01:51:53,236 --> 01:51:55,113
Up to a point.

1132
01:51:58,477 --> 01:52:00,195
Up to a point.

1133
01:52:15,757 --> 01:52:18,066
(Bill knocks)

1134
01:52:26,277 --> 01:52:28,154
I made this for you, sir.

1135
01:52:36,596 --> 01:52:39,588
I don't want you
hanging around here any more.

1136
01:52:41,317 --> 01:52:43,433
Keep away from me from now on.

1137
01:52:44,757 --> 01:52:47,224
- Go and join the others.
- But...

1138
01:52:47,356 --> 01:52:50,154
Just... just bloody join in, will you?

1139
01:52:53,677 --> 01:52:56,111
Go and play, damn you!

1140
01:53:06,197 --> 01:53:07,995
(♪ Musical intro)

1141
01:53:08,118 --> 01:53:11,189
(Singer introduces song in French)

1142
01:53:12,918 --> 01:53:15,476
Could you check, Jerry?

1143
01:53:29,317 --> 01:53:32,707
(♪ Sings La Mer in French)

1144
01:53:36,918 --> 01:53:39,113
(Applause)

1145
01:54:14,958 --> 01:54:17,189
(♪ Singing continues...)

1146
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:21,954
(Song ends)

1147
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:24,594
(Applause)
