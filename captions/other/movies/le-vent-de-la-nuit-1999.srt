00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,197
THE WIND OF THE NIGHT

2
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,473
<i>When we first met</i>
<i>and you proposed...</i>

3
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,910
<i>I told myself: "This guy is crazy".</i>

4
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,279
<i>I couldn't believe you.</i>

5
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,676
<i>What is he looking for?</i>

6
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,030
<i>But later I realized</i>
<i>I wanted you and said...</i>

7
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,035
<i>"Even if its for the money, I'll pay.</i>

8
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,311
<i>Anyway, I'm not taking it to
the grave".</i>

9
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,318
<i>So I told myself: "I'll give all"</i>

10
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,353
<i>And I wasn't thinking about money
but about me.</i>

11
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,315
<i>And now you are the one
pulling back.</i>

12
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,911
Tie your hair. I like you austere.

13
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,113
With your glasses.

14
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,113
You like it?

15
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,909
Yes.

16
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,470
And would you like a some sex?

17
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,273
Come here.

18
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,959
You are beautiful.

19
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,749
I lost a daughter 8 years ago.

20
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,270
She died at birth.

21
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,710
And now I can't have children.

22
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,273
She was the first and didn't survive.

23
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,558
It's sad.

24
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,909
Yes.

25
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,995
We go through a part of the
way together...

26
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,269
and then maybe...

27
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,710
Why do you tell me this?

28
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,116
Because its the true, 
don't you think so?

29
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,714
No.

30
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,835
If every time we began
we though about the end, then...

31
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,917
I don't think about the future.

32
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,912
If I thought about the future
I wouldn't be here with you.

33
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,829
I would.

34
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,831
I just saw a sensual girl
leaving the building.

35
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,433
All she emanated, her age...

36
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,630
all that has hurt me.

37
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,319
I thought you could fall
in love with her.

38
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,714
But its crazy to torture
yourself like that.

39
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,069
What girl?

40
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,272
I haven't seen a pretty
girl in this building.

41
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,990
And me, why did you chose me?

42
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,714
Stop torturing yourself, please.

43
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,117
You really want it?

44
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,989
- Have I made you sad?
- No, why?

45
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,517
Do you want us to drop it?

46
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,914
You're crazy!

47
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,479
Then, why did you tell me 
that before?

48
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,479
It crossed my mind.
Sometimes I'm a fool.

49
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,551
- Thanks. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

50
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,033
Kiss me.

51
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,159
Stop!
You'll make me drop the icecream!

52
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,917
Maybe I'll leave tomorrow.

53
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,998
- And where are you going?
- To Naples.

54
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,317
I have to inaugurate a statue
I made for a construction.

55
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,273
But I'll call you.

56
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,993
When will you be back?

57
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,669
I don't know if I have an 
open ticket.

58
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,116
I'll tell you when I find out.

59
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,035
You must be proud.
It's the first time, right?

60
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,197
Yes, sure.

61
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,915
Yes.

62
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,958
Do you want us to be together
longer this night?

63
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,673
I can try to fix it.

64
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,269
This night I can't,
I have a lot to do.

65
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,312
When I come back, if you want...

66
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,510
I don't want you to leave.

67
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,989
Me neither.
But it's important. Anyway...

68
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,159
I could have arranged to go
with you, but now so sudden...

69
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,279
But it's still possible,
because he doesn't suspect.

70
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,869
He usually travels without me
and so do I.

71
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,360
I thought about it, but I thought
it would be difficult for you.

72
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,198
I didn't want to get you
in trouble.

73
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,072
Plus, I wasn't sure then.

74
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,157
It's a pity, because I
really want to.

75
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,953
And you?

76
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,274
Of course.

77
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,315
Taxi!

78
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,519
Paul!

79
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,439
It's very good.

80
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,195
I don't know.

81
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,274
Here it is fine.
This side is more forced.

82
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,030
Something bothers me,
I should have cut a bit more.

83
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,233
But it's done now.

84
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,511
Now let's move on.

85
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,474
Wait.

86
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,474
Could you take Paul
to the Naples airport?

87
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,478
- Paul?
- Paul, my assistant.

88
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,955
- Why don't you take him?
- Because I must stay here.

89
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,912
I still have work to do.

90
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,353
- Could you?
- Yes.

91
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,635
I'm a bit disappointed. It's a
bit annoying, don't you think?

92
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,955
What is?

93
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,313
Art is not that: the presence of
the mayor, the prefect, all that.

94
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,199
It's depressing, don't you think?

95
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,389
- Where are we exactly?
- Positano.

96
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,399
- Have you been here before?
- I lived here for a year.

97
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,437
- Oh, yeah? What did you do?
- Nothing.

98
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,994
We were 5 or 6 in a house.
We lived.

99
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,634
When?

100
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,319
In the 69.

101
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,828
- And in the 68, where were you?
- In Paris.

102
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,912
- So you were in the revolution?
- Like the rest.

103
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,272
- And did you believe in it?
- Yes. No.

104
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,549
Shall we?

105
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,876
Wait. I'll take a picture.

106
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,877
And in the 68 what did you do,
beside the manifestations?

107
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,595
Did you put bombs or 
something like that?

108
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,113
We were revolutionaries.

109
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,112
And we you are a revolutionary,
you make a revolution.

110
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,589
Yes.

111
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,512
Actually "being" was enough.

112
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,119
Yes, a bit like me.
Anyway, like I want to be.

113
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,878
Will I search a solution,
I study.

114
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,279
I'm taking a computer course
focused on Fine Arts.

115
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,757
But with the crisis nobody
buys paintings or sculptures.

116
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,031
I will not risk myself...

117
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,112
and I'll do architecture.

118
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,550
That way I can be your assistant.

119
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,478
Assistant like with Jean?

120
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,318
Well, yes.

121
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,510
You know, architecture is the same,
there's not much work.

122
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,718
- I'll buy cigarettes? Want some?
- No.

123
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,796
Can I ask you something?

124
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,396
Could I go back with you tomorrow?

125
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,836
I won't be in Paris 'till
the day after tomorrow.

126
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,519
It's fine with me.

127
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,874
- You have anything to do in Paris?
- No.

128
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,398
So take a plane later.

129
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,309
Go to Pompeii and Herculano.

130
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,749
Take advantage.

131
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,076
Yes, but I have to go back.

132
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,874
I can lie about losing the plane,
understand?

133
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,517
So I can take the time to think.
Do you want me to explain?

134
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,438
No, it isn't necessary.

135
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,238
Serge.

136
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,319
Thanks a lot.

137
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,115
Well ok, but I don't take you
to the end don't be angry then.

138
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,354
Will you abandon me
in a parking lot!

139
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,668
It could happen.

140
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,793
What do electroshocks do?

141
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,318
They burn the brain.

142
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,111
Why did they gave them to you?

143
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,559
After 68 some ended in prison.

144
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,434
Others in a disciplinary
battalion.

145
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,552
And others in the 
psychiatric ward.

146
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,435
They gave you electroshocks
for participating in may 68?

147
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,512
Not exactly,
but that's what happened.

148
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,873
Do they tie you when they
give you the electroshocks?

149
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,512
Yes, they tie you to a lead
bed, above a machine.

150
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,110
In an electroshocks machine.

151
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,469
But one must resist,
so the guys must be...

152
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,115
Yes, they're two or three.
They grab you. You resist.

153
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,678
You fight.

154
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,593
So they take you by the 
force to a room.

155
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,595
It's a nightmare, all that.
You don't know what they'll do.

156
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,713
Yes, you see a machine
with buttons everywhere.

157
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,317
They tie you with straps to
a lead bed.

158
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,511
Fuck! How it hurts when
you wake up!

159
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,270
I felt so much pain that I 
pissed near the barbed wire.

160
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,077
Because I wanted to...

161
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,751
- Finish once for all?
- Yes.

162
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,269
It wasn't electrified?

163
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,788
No.

164
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,511
It must had been beautiful
this house.

165
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,908
Do you want to buy it to retire?

166
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,839
By the way! In Ravelo's work...

167
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,918
- I don't want to talk about work.
- Ok.

168
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,915
If you talk to me about work
you make me thing about work.

169
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,316
I prefer to think about
other stuff.

170
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,749
Ok?

171
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,109
Ok.

172
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,228
Don't have a radio?

173
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,909
No. When I drive I 
listen to the motor.

174
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,117
- You wife is an architect too?
- I don't have a wife.

175
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,152
Did you have one?

176
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,509
Did she leave you?

177
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,633
She killed herself.

178
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,314
Do you think my generation have
stagnated in your generation?

179
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,550
I can't say. I don't know many.
Why do you ask?

180
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,912
I have the impression
I am going crazy.

181
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,953
I no longer see the world 
as it is, but like it was.

182
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,752
Do you ever drink alcohol?

183
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,395
I drank.

184
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,472
- Very much?
- A lot.

185
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,352
And what else?

186
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,349
Everything.

187
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,714
This also?

188
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,514
Heroin?

189
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,518
- Do you want to die?
- No.

190
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,120
Don't worry.
I control it perfectly.

191
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,516
I've heard that you don�t drive
a Porsche, you pilot it.

192
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,236
But what's the difference
between driving and piloting?

193
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,711
Be happy to be driving.

194
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,274
Go out this way.

195
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,116
There's something I'd like to see.

196
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,799
It's not bad. What is it?

197
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,512
An unfinished palace.

198
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,909
The italians were as good with
unfinished as finished things.

199
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,112
It's strange, you always seem
to be saying two things at a time.

200
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,710
Better to say it all, no?

201
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,353
You are sharp!

202
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,917
Sharp is the last person.

203
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,635
What are you doing?

204
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,195
Nothing. I'm not sharp. I know
how to drive, so I drive.

205
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,118
But slower, alright?

206
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,755
Alright.

207
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,630
But how was all exactly?

208
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,674
How could these guys maintain
the student control?

209
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,234
They made meetings.

210
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,714
Like politicians.

211
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,279
The old told the young...

212
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,551
"Come, we've waited since 1936".

213
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,599
They were all old.

214
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,996
Old anarchist, great.

215
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,753
There was a room aside...

216
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,912
where the power was.

217
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,318
A student left.
It was all a stage up.

218
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,791
He knocked on the wall and said...

219
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,157
everyone lower their voice
and he said...

220
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,839
"The password".

221
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,118
There was one who said:
"To Denfert-Rochereau! Tomorrow!"

222
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,359
"Tomorrow at what hour?"
Then one guy would said: "23 hours!"

223
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,712
"�23 hours tomorrow, Denfert!
We'll be 3.000. Dismissed!"

224
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,554
And they organized everything
without the police knowledge?

225
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,193
Without them knowing.

226
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,914
- And everytime was somewhere new?
- Yes.

227
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,559
Next day I arrived at Denfert 
it was hallucinating.

228
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,719
There were workers with shovels
ripping the traffic lights.

229
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,828
<i>Hello, you are calling</i>
<i>Jerome and Solange.</i>

230
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,553
<i>We're not home.</i>

231
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,910
<i>You can leave a message.</i>

232
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,152
Jerome? It's Serge.

233
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,112
I guess you are vacationing
with your family.

234
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,108
I wanted to talk to  you,
but maybe its better this way.

235
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,788
I'm leaving.

236
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,919
And when you find out officially...

237
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,716
Everything is ready, you'll
find the papers in my desk.

238
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,079
Give dad a kiss for me.

239
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,873
And one for you also.

240
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,913
Auto-Deliverance

241
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,799
Is everything alright?

242
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,229
�Oh, sorry!

243
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,388
Is it a prescription drug?

244
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,477
- Yes, nothing important.
- Is it serious?

245
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,113
No, its not really serious.

246
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,073
Are you sure? I can go...

247
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,828
- I can go buy the same.
- What's wrong with you?

248
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,435
Nothing, I dropped it,
I'm sorry.

249
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,235
What's wrong with you?

250
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,911
No, nothing, I took a bit of...

251
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,999
The streets are full of guys
selling stuff.

252
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,077
I couldn't resist.

253
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,558
I wanted to invite
you to have a drink.

254
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,989
Someone of my generation...

255
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,390
Would surely admire you.

256
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,153
I exaggerate.

257
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,115
But it fascinates us because
the drugs of our generatiion...

258
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,868
don't cause hallucinations.

259
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,674
Your brain never explodes.

260
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,072
That the big difference I feel
between you and me...

261
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,516
about this experience.

262
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,038
Yes, I've had coke..

263
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,276
It made me feel a little weird.

264
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,269
Heroin is for puking.

265
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,279
You crawl through the floor,
you can't get up.

266
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,073
I've never really taken off.

267
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,112
And when I talk to people 
from your generation...

268
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,915
They've always left reality.
Do you know what I mean?

269
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,557
I don't know, take crack,
you never really take off.

270
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,198
It's like a lighter
inside the head...

271
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,799
but it doesn't last.

272
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,949
It's shit.

273
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,673
You never take off.

274
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,390
I think the real difference...

275
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,592
in my times, to get stoned...

276
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,116
was wanting to be alone.

277
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,228
But LSD was something else.
It was a horror.

278
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,714
- And your girlfriend also took it?
- Yes.

279
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,631
- Did you fuck? Could you?
- I've never fucked.

280
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,108
I have never fucked.

281
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,514
- And then?
- I usually don't talk of this.

282
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,430
Did you talk with them
about them?

283
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,315
With them yes.

284
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,911
Not with the rest? Not with me?

285
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,633
That's right.

286
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,917
So let's not talk about it.

287
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,754
If you wanna talk, talk.

288
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,276
- But you don't talk about it.
- No.

289
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,118
But why?

290
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,230
Because for me women
are sacred.

291
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,551
"Sacred". What a word!

292
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,193
I don't have other.

293
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,875
But what means sacred to you?

294
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,197
Intimate? Private?

295
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,311
No. It's what is saved. What's
left when nothing else is left.

296
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,629
Well, goodbye!

297
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,920
- Have you thought about me?
- Yes, I've thought about you.

298
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,719
- What did you think?
- I desired you.

299
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,838
What do you mean?

300
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,636
I don't know, I wanted
to see your breasts.

301
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,193
Liar.

302
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,073
Tell me.

303
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,278
No, later.

304
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,997
- You're not angry anymore?
- No.

305
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,110
I'll give you a check
for the telephone.

306
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,913
No.

307
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,152
- No, I don't want it.
- Come on!

308
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,158
No, sure. Please!

309
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,509
It's important we
can call each other.

310
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,712
Yes, but it's important
that you don't pay.

311
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,589
Thanks.

312
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,309
Is the best martini in Paris. Taste.

313
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:56,629
You like it?

314
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,194
Yes.

315
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,399
It's here.

316
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,516
The windows on the third floor.

317
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,158
- Coming?
- Are you crazy?

318
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,073
But why? You're wrong.

319
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,555
My husband is quite open.
He sees all kind of people.

320
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,831
Well, maybe, but, why me?

321
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,916
I want you to meet
my husband!

322
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,553
- Are you scared?
- No.

323
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,516
Come! I'm not afraid of anything!

324
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,553
And you?

325
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,634
Let's go.

326
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,073
Kiss me.

327
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:27,317
He felt a great admiration
for the athletes...

328
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,076
And he had a speech
about sports...

329
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,350
about the interior of
the athlete...

330
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,348
about the future,
his psychology...

331
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,879
his suffering.

332
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,708
It's also a look into himself.

333
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,431
When he talks about the athlete...

334
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,240
that athlete dying inside...

335
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,956
the one he never was...

336
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,472
alcoholic as he was...

337
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,359
he lived his degradation
day by day...

338
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,876
and thought about it
with great clearity.

339
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,919
I usually compare Blondin...

340
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,079
with someone who
lived his life...

341
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,471
and wrote his work...

342
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,194
lamenting not being someone else.

343
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,198
Understand?

344
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,515
Paul?

345
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,950
Do you mind me calling you Paul?

346
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,356
There's people that suffer...

347
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,915
for not having been a poet
or an artist.

348
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,396
He, Blondin...

349
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,834
suffered for not being an athlete...

350
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,470
and thought about suicide...

351
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,273
in front of athletes he
considered magnificent.

352
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,873
Better than him.

353
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,956
Could you turn that down
a little?

354
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,798
We can't hear ourselves!

355
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,714
Its strange, I always thought
he was a bit fascist.

356
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,112
Absolutely.

357
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,518
He was a right anarchist.

358
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,954
And because everybody then
was from the left...

359
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,231
He had to be from the right.

360
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,391
But he wasn't pro-nazi.

361
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,149
Absolutely.

362
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,713
All the intellectuals
were from the left.

363
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,310
It was a consequence
from the war.

364
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,673
From the horrors
of those six years.

365
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,390
He loathed that attitude.

366
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,839
He found it sheep-like...

367
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,991
because even many...

368
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,669
married the cause...

369
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,393
many others...

370
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,558
simply pretended to be left.

371
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:53,595
He decided to live his way.

372
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:58,835
Live his intellectual life
away from all that.

373
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,390
He didn't have the
notion of collectivity.

374
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,278
He was interested in
each individual.

375
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,958
Also...

376
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,556
he valued friendship a lot.

377
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,433
It's fun.

378
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,598
He told his wife
before marrying...

379
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,389
"I won't offer you 
a life of luxury...

380
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,829
but I'll present you my friends".

381
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,359
What something else?

382
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,998
No, I have to go.

383
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,034
Thanks.

384
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,438
Come whenever you want.

385
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,468
Shall I give you two kisses?

386
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,195
Long live anarchy!

387
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,879
- I know a doctor.
- Well call him!

388
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,230
I know a doctor around the corner.
I'm gonna go for him.

389
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,919
Go get him!

390
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,030
Loosen the belt.
It hurts.

391
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,311
If I loosen it,
you'll lose blood.

392
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,116
Yes, but it hurts.
Please, loosen it a little.

393
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,637
If I loosen it you die.
You don't want to die.

394
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,478
I'm sure you don't want to die.

395
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,149
It hurts. Loosen it.

396
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,230
Free me from this!

397
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,078
Think in everything
you haven't seen yet.

398
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,679
In what remains to be seen.

399
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,473
- It hurts.
- Have you been to the desert?

400
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,193
I don't care.

401
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,557
- Trust me.
- You are hurting me.

402
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,799
Trust me.

403
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,718
I'm feeling bad!

404
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,713
I'm feeling bad!

405
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,553
It's here. Please...

406
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,319
What are you doing to me?

407
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,479
No!

408
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,311
I would like to drink something.

409
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,275
Are you ok?

410
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:25,715
Yes?

411
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,039
Is it white wine?

412
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,599
How fool am I!

413
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:02,315
Speak.

414
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,828
Yes?

415
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,314
Hello, Paul.

416
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,318
Yes, and you?

417
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,314
I can't.

418
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,919
No, I'm going to Berlin.

419
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,510
Would you give me your
phone number?

420
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,429
Yes.

421
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,794
I'll call you.

422
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:36,514
See you later.

423
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,031
- Were you afraid?
- Yes.

424
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,515
- Have you spoken to her again?
- No.

425
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,396
Are you afraid it might
start again?

426
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,753
Yes, she is the kind you leave
for five minutes to buy the paper...

427
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:15,191
and you don't know
how you'll find her.

428
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,232
She is bad, but she is strong.

429
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,555
I've felt something strange.

430
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:22,515
I don't know if this always happen 
with people who want to comitte suicide...

431
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,076
but one has the impression
they're not there anymore.

432
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:27,715
Like if they were already
in the other side.

433
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,557
You're going to fast.

434
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:47,319
There's no speed limit here.

435
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,158
I don't know.

436
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,512
But you are going to fast.
Please don't go too fast.

437
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,748
By the way, why are
we going to Berlin?

438
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,273
Work.

439
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,192
What have you done lately?

440
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,351
I've left heroin.

441
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,950
- Since when?
- Since last time.

442
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:45,709
I must have a clear head if I want
to be your assisnt. Remember?

443
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,916
- Are you going to follow thru?
- Yes.

444
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:53,068
- Do you swear?
- If you want, yes.

445
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,552
Then say it.

446
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,479
I swear. I swear to you.

447
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,398
I swear to you.

448
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,999
There's a bar there.
Do you wanna stop for 5 minutes?

449
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,677
It's been three hours.

450
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,837
Come, there's no police.

451
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:12,028
Fuck, it's still going. You
should had seen how he spoke...

452
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:13,469
<i>the Obersturmf�hrer.</i>

453
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,876
I can imagine what he did
in 1940.

454
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,878
I thought your generation
had forgotten all about it.

455
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:21,914
- But he's not a nazi sympathizer.
- Can you calm your friend, please?

456
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,316
<i>Aufwiedersehen!</i> Good bye!

457
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:37,310
You've acted like a moron.

458
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,237
I was a moron yesterday.

459
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,439
Do you forgive me?

460
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,234
It's quite good! 
Have you seen it?

461
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,795
- Come on.
- You only find like here in Paris.

462
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,833
- I'll stay with you.
- No, I have a date.

463
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,758
I don't have money.
Can you leave 200... Very kind.

464
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,279
I'll give it back.

465
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:35,475
<i>Danke schen.</i>

466
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,352
- See you later.
- Yes.

467
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,799
<i>Hallo. Gutten Tag.</i>

468
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,719
<i>You speak franzsisch?</i>

469
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:50,189
Wait, I don't understand.

470
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:53,278
<i>Wieviel...</i>

471
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:54,834
Want <i>wieviel?</i>

472
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:58,712
<i>Zweihundert?</i>

473
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,752
<i>Zweihundert</i> francs. Ok?

474
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,678
<i>Y'a mein zimmer.</i>

475
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,109
<i>Danke.</i>

476
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:56,913
What's up?

477
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,228
- How you been?
- Good. And you?

478
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:01,829
Me?

479
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:12,715
What a problem I have,
don't you think?

480
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,991
This thing about my girl.

481
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,430
Do you have news of her?

482
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,999
I haven't called.
I could have, but...

483
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:25,395
I'm afraid. She is
another person...

484
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:28,317
and I'm really afraid.

485
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:34,479
She has had money always. She is 
quite burgeoise and not stupid...

486
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:38,196
but I think she wants
to fuck everything up.

487
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:43,319
Maybe she loves you and
that's why you are afraid.

488
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,791
That wouldn't scare me.

489
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:53,631
Why did she did it?

490
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,198
I don't know.

491
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:01,317
I'm not amazed, but the
reason I don't know.

492
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,632
Are you ok?

493
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:09,708
- What's wrong?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

494
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,557
Are you alone?

495
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,398
No, thanks.

496
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,114
She is Helene.

497
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:39,635
Serge.

498
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,638
- Hello.
- Hello.

499
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,195
I'm dying of hunger. And you?

500
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,631
- Shall we have dinner?
- Yes.

501
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:19,274
I never knew how to eat
with sticks.

502
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,073
Do you want a fork?

503
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:22,315
Waiter!

504
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:23,555
Waiter!

505
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:30,675
- Your friend Serge is a sculpter also?
- Can you bring a fork?

506
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:32,109
Forget it.

507
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:33,868
I'm not hungry.

508
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,309
I'm dead tired.

509
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:40,710
I'll go for my backpack. 
Can you lend me your keys?

510
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:46,749
Thanks.

511
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:58,599
You're not angry, right?
I am really tired.

512
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,678
Yes, yes, you've said that.

513
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,279
Good bye, Paul.

514
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:08,913
Good bye.

515
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:27,672
It's strange, but I have
the impression of being here...

516
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,712
some time ago.

517
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:36,316
Me too. Long time ago.

518
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,518
What am I saying!

519
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,877
Try this, it's delicious.

520
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:48,679
Try it.

521
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,110
I would like to stay with you.

522
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,119
Thanks.

523
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:14,276
I would like that too.

524
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,910
- Can you wait two minutes?
- Yes.

525
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:43,039
16 francs and 30 cents, please.

526
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:58,554
Thanks.

527
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:05,715
Thanks.

528
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:31,873
I would like a room.

529
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:33,673
A marriage bed?

530
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:35,712
A marriage bed.

531
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:16,114
I'm nervous.

532
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,755
It's silly, but its
the first time.

533
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:20,917
I'm also nervous.

534
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:44,035
Better this way?

535
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:46,514
Yes.

536
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:43,719
When you are 40, to make love
with someone younger is great.

537
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:45,879
It gives you wings.

538
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,398
You feel admired, superior.

539
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:52,159
It makes you strong.

540
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:55,510
You take advantage of the
other's youth.

541
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:57,279
Everything is a game.

542
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:02,873
Then it is not.

543
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,956
The balance is lost.

544
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,309
You are at the mercy of the
one you love.

545
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,117
You look how he's watching.

546
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:18,314
You are always under the impression that
he's watching when you're not looking.

547
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:21,035
You ask yourself...

548
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:24,790
if everything you see in the 
mirror. All those details...

549
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,432
the belly...

550
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:29,711
the neck...

551
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:33,357
I'm not saying this to
make it less.

552
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,512
Everything that hurts.

553
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:41,031
It difficult to accept oneself.

554
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,078
We don't know each other...

555
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:52,717
but it is like if we knew
each other from long ago.

556
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,914
When making love,
one is alone.

557
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:01,478
When making love is very
intense, one is alone.

558
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:05,912
It's precisely because we are both
alone, that together we form a third.

559
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:10,275
I would like to know...

560
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,437
that if when you asked
me to stay...

561
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:13,675
was it because...

562
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:15,951
Because when I saw you in the
corner I thought...

563
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:17,912
What is she doing here at 11?

564
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,109
Usually I am not that lost.

565
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:42,509
Oh, no?

566
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:44,195
Idiot!

567
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,279
No, but...

568
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:48,959
Yes?

569
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:52,751
Nothing. You wouldn't understand.

570
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:59,157
I'm fine with you.

571
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,279
Yes.

572
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:02,718
<i>Jerome...</i>

573
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:07,393
<i>I've decided...</i>

574
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:11,153
<i>to leave...</i>

575
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:14,318
<i>this life.</i>

576
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,471
<i>Don't be sad.</i>

577
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:21,351
<i>It's the only solution.</i>

578
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:27,517
<i>Take care of dad...</i>

579
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:31,791
<i>like only you know.</i>

580
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:38,637
<i>Your brother that loves you.</i>
