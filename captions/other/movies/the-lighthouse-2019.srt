Our time could be up and nobody

We are running low on fuel.

[Griffith] Ah. Henry Whiteside.

Winter of '76, a storm came in.

Whiteside and his boys
were trapped out here in it.

No rescue boats.
She was a bad one.

So, old Whiteside put a message

Twenty-five miles

Twenty-five miles of hell.

This island

Before this beacon was built,

Perhaps she is still hungry.

Leave it, Tom.

Six good men, all dead,
and you are here.

Do you ever think of them?

- Leave it.

Do you know what happened?
What really happened?

513
01:00:23,852 --> 01:00:27,772
It was my fourth keep.

514
01:00:29,107 --> 01:00:34,071
But... but my first island.
An island, Tom.

515
01:00:35,071 --> 01:00:39,241
An island, like this.

516
01:00:39,243 --> 01:00:45,288
Miles from land...
and a fog came in.

517
01:00:45,290 --> 01:00:50,379
A fog, heavy.

518
01:00:51,671 --> 01:00:56,716
Seven days.
We thought it would never end.

519
01:00:56,718 --> 01:01:00,388
No relief on an island.

520
01:01:02,265 --> 01:01:05,435
They will not risk a boat.

521
01:01:06,937 --> 01:01:10,104
We rang that bastard bell,

522
01:01:10,106 --> 01:01:14,151
day and night and...

523
01:01:14,153 --> 01:01:20,618
...and on the sixth day,
Lewis fell sick.

524
01:01:21,285 --> 01:01:23,788
A fever, bad.

525
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:32,169
So I... I stood on that platform

526
01:01:32,171 --> 01:01:37,218
and rang that bell for 15 hours.

527
01:01:48,562 --> 01:01:52,149
I cannot remember sleeping, Tom.

528
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:57,154
But when I woke up,
six men were dead.

529
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,154
They hit the rocks in the fog,

530
01:02:00,156 --> 01:02:03,827
drowned, all of them,
because I slept.

531
01:02:07,705 --> 01:02:12,836
And now this,
another dead man...

532
01:02:16,214 --> 01:02:20,385
And they will blame me
for you also.

533
01:02:21,178 --> 01:02:24,348
But you fell, Tom.

534
01:02:25,182 --> 01:02:27,517
You fell!

535
01:02:30,229 --> 01:02:33,647
To the Smalls.

536
01:02:33,649 --> 01:02:35,776
Still hungry.

537
01:03:01,051 --> 01:03:03,511
How's the food, Tom?

538
01:03:12,104 --> 01:03:14,522
How long, Tom?

539
01:03:17,234 --> 01:03:19,737
How long till they come for us?

540
01:03:29,245 --> 01:03:33,582
You do not wish to talk
tonight? Fine.

01:21:48,846 --> 01:21:50,929
[Griffith whispers]
Thomas Howell.

684
01:21:50,931 --> 01:21:54,018
[Howell]
Is this his punishment?

685
01:21:56,020 --> 01:21:59,565
May God save my soul.

686
01:22:11,534 --> 01:22:14,412

It is time.

- You know what you must do.
- No...

696

Seven men, Thomas Howell.

Join us.

705
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:07,733
[Howell] I know that the Lord
has damned me for what I did.

706
01:24:07,735 --> 01:24:11,194
My very soul is now in peril.

707
01:24:11,196 --> 01:24:17,158
I can no longer endure
this punishment.

708
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:23,372
And unto every Christian soul
that is distressed

709
01:24:23,374 --> 01:24:26,002
grant thou mercy.

710

Forgive me.

[laughs]

718
01:25:44,414 --> 01:25:46,917
You are dead, Tom.

719
01:26:08,772 --> 01:26:11,316
Leave me alone.

720
01:26:21,619 --> 01:26:24,205
[Griffith whispers] Join us.

When he comes for me...

722

I suffer the darkness
of the other world.

723

Come now, Thomas Howell.

- [whispering]
- Join us.

725
01:26:40,346 --> 01:26:44,264
[Howell] Through
the black hours of every night,

726
01:26:44,266 --> 01:26:47,978
this Devil's knock
interrupts my terrible dreams.

727
01:26:54,651 --> 01:26:57,068
[Griffith whispers]
Accept his punishment.

728
01:26:57,070 --> 01:27:01,572
[Howell] I know now that Thomas
Griffith haunts this tower.

729
01:27:01,574 --> 01:27:04,702
He wishes me
to damn myself to hell.

730
01:27:05,370 --> 01:27:08,162
He wishes to punish me.

731
01:27:08,164 --> 01:27:12,291
He walks this cursed place
in the darkness of death,

732
01:27:12,293 --> 01:27:17,673
and he wishes me to damn
my eternal soul with the noose.

733
01:27:17,675 --> 01:27:18,674
Leave me!

734
01:27:18,676 --> 01:27:21,300
He will not take me.
He will not take me!

735
01:27:21,302 --> 01:27:25,013
He will not take me!
He will not take me!

736
01:27:25,015 --> 01:27:26,976
No!

737
01:27:51,749 --> 01:27:54,002
[Howell] Tom?

738
01:27:56,212 --> 01:27:59,548
[Griffith]
When can I go home, Thomas?

739
01:27:59,550 --> 01:28:02,093
[Howell] You cannot go home.

740
01:28:03,762 --> 01:28:06,015
Why?

741
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:10,394
[Howell] Because you fell.

742
01:28:12,061 --> 01:28:14,395
So I cannot go home?

743
01:28:14,397 --> 01:28:16,734
[Howell] No.

744
01:28:25,074 --> 01:28:28,119
[Griffith] I'm lonely out here.

745
01:28:36,796 --> 01:28:39,757
Will you stay with me?

746
01:28:40,925 --> 01:28:43,511
I cannot stay.

747
01:28:44,762 --> 01:28:48,307
- Why?
- I...

748
01:28:49,975 --> 01:28:52,186
You are...

749
01:28:52,936 --> 01:28:55,439
I cannot find them.

750
01:28:57,274 --> 01:28:59,401
Not here.

751
01:29:00,401 --> 01:29:03,196
Not in this place.

752
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:05,824
Who?

753
01:29:07,993 --> 01:29:10,287
Heledd...

754
01:29:11,413 --> 01:29:14,125
...and my Annie.

755
01:29:15,458 --> 01:29:18,878
I cannot find them here.

756
01:29:21,507 --> 01:29:24,301
I cannot find them here.

757
01:29:33,644 --> 01:29:38,022
Am I... in hell?

758
01:29:49,659 --> 01:29:52,162
The others are here, Thomas.

759
01:29:55,039 --> 01:29:56,917
The others?

760
01:29:59,378 --> 01:30:02,336
Henry Rees,

761
01:30:02,338 --> 01:30:05,506
John Elias,

762
01:30:05,508 --> 01:30:08,176
Daniel Rowlands,

763
01:30:08,178 --> 01:30:10,306

...David Jones,

765
01:30:13,767 --> 01:30:16,393
Charles Johns.

766
01:30:16,395 --> 01:30:18,272
No.

767
01:30:21,357 --> 01:30:23,068
And now you.

768
01:30:24,028 --> 01:30:26,321
I'm not dead, Tom.

769
01:30:29,824 --> 01:30:31,032
No...

770
01:30:31,034 --> 01:30:34,702
No, no, no. No, no, no! No!

771
01:30:34,704 --> 01:30:35,703
[Howell] I know what I must do.

772
01:30:35,705 --> 01:30:38,040
I must rid myself
of Thomas Griffith.

773
01:30:38,042 --> 01:30:40,041
I must cast him into the deep.

774
01:30:40,043 --> 01:30:42,920
[Griffith]
This island took you, Thomas.

775
01:30:42,922 --> 01:30:47,590
Your soul, it is already lost.

776
01:30:47,592 --> 01:30:50,135
You will not take me.
You will not take me.

777
01:30:50,137 --> 01:30:51,219
The Devil is here!

778
01:30:51,221 --> 01:30:56,017
[Griffith] Do you not remember,
Thomas? Ending it?

779
01:30:56,894 --> 01:30:58,893
When he comes for me...

780
01:30:58,895 --> 01:31:00,645
Ending it all with the noose?

781
01:31:00,647 --> 01:31:03,523
[Howell] I did not damn myself.
I did not hang!

782
01:31:03,525 --> 01:31:06,443
- I did not damn myself!
- You are in hell.

783
01:31:06,445 --> 01:31:09,696
- I did not damn myself!
- Eight men, Thomas.

784
01:31:09,698 --> 01:31:11,447
- The Devil...
- Eight men.

785
01:31:11,449 --> 01:31:14,992
[Griffith whispers] Come now,
Thomas Howell. It is time.

786

- Seven men.
- Come!

794
01:31:33,763 --> 01:31:36,100
[Griffith] Charon waits!

795
01:31:36,934 --> 01:31:38,517
No!

796
01:31:38,519 --> 01:31:41,853
[Howell] You will not take me.
You will not take me.

797
01:31:41,855 --> 01:31:43,855
The Devil is here.

798
01:31:43,857 --> 01:31:47,358
I will endure your punishment.

799
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:51,531
- Seven.
- And I will be redeemed!

800
01:31:52,115 --> 01:31:54,198

I've seen it, Tom.

808
01:32:34,784 --> 01:32:37,161
[Griffith] What, Thomas?

809
01:32:38,244 --> 01:32:40,663
What did you see?

810
01:32:44,043 --> 01:32:46,462
You're in hell.

811
01:32:51,092 --> 01:32:53,344
[Griffith sighs]

812
01:32:56,012 --> 01:32:58,765
We're both in hell, Thomas.

813
01:33:01,060 --> 01:33:04,146
The storm took us both.

814
01:33:08,316 --> 01:33:11,236
It took you, Tom.

815
01:33:11,779 --> 01:33:13,696
Took you.

816
01:33:15,449 --> 01:33:19,036
Both our souls burn, Thomas.

817
01:33:19,869 --> 01:33:22,038
No.

818
01:33:26,377 --> 01:33:29,588
We both died on this island,
Thomas.

819
01:33:30,797 --> 01:33:36,136
Both you... and I.

820

Come now...

...Thomas Howell.

822
01:33:51,985 --> 01:33:54,238
It's time to leave.

823
01:34:01,787 --> 01:34:07,376
Lasciate ogne speranza,
voi ch'entrate.

824

Lasciate ogne speranza,

I have paid.

831
01:34:39,784 --> 01:34:42,620
I did not hang.

832
01:34:43,287 --> 01:34:45,289
I did not hang!

833
01:34:46,414 --> 01:34:49,459
I did not damn myself!

834
01:34:50,503 --> 01:34:51,876
No!

You're safe!
