A CAFÉ — NANA WANTS TO GIVE UP —
PAUL — THE PINBALL MACHINE

8
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:14,696
Do you really like the guy?

9
00:03:16,114 --> 00:03:18,032
I don't know.

10
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:20,535
I wonder
what I was even thinking.

11
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:22,620
Does he have more money
than me?

12
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:24,706
What do you care?

13
00:03:25,874 --> 00:03:27,750
What do you care?

14
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:35,967
Something bothering you?

15
00:03:36,134 --> 00:03:40,138
No, I just wanted to deliver
that line a specific way.

16
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:43,933
I didn't know
the best way to say it.

17
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:48,146
Or I did know,
but I don't anymore.

18
00:03:48,646 --> 00:03:52,984
Just when I should know, too.
Doesn't that ever happen to you?

19
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:56,404
Don't you ever talk
about anything but yourself?

20
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:58,740
You're horrible.

21
00:04:00,617 --> 00:04:03,870
I'm not horrible, Nana.
I'm sad.

22
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:08,249
I'm not sad, Paul.
I'm horrible.

23
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,753
Don't talk nonsense.
This isn't a stage.

24
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:18,259
You never do as I ask, but you
always want me to do what you want.

25
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:21,763
Anyway, I'm fed up.
I want to die.

26
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,515
- Is that so?
- Yes, that's so.

27
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:26,684
More nonsense.

28
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:32,190
It's exhausting loving you.
I always have to beg.

29
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:34,943
I exist too.

30
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:38,112
You say I'm cruel,
but you're the cruel one.

31
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,002
Why do you say that? It isn't true.
You mean Sunday evening?

32
00:04:53,962 --> 00:04:55,546
You know very well when.

33
00:04:55,672 --> 00:04:58,508
I begged you
to introduce me to that man.

34
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:00,969
You did it on purpose.

35
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:02,679
Yes, I did.

36
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:05,014
You're pathetic.

37
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,311
If we started over,
I'd just cheat on you again.

38
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:12,146
Don't say that.

39
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:18,736
Don't say that.

40
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:20,154
It's true.

41
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:24,826
I thought it was important
we should meet, but I don't anymore.

42
00:05:25,535 --> 00:05:28,663
We might have
got together again.

43
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,916
But the more we talk,
the less the words mean.

44
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:37,338
Anyway, if I make it on the stage,
it won't be thanks to you.

45
00:05:37,797 --> 00:05:39,882
Acting isn't everything.

46
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:42,260
Not you too!
Why do you say that?

47
00:05:42,427 --> 00:05:45,179
If it's what I want,
why should you mind?

48
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:48,016
I might be discovered
someday.

49
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,403
Yes, you mustn't give up.

50
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:03,031
I haven't given up music.

51
00:06:03,156 --> 00:06:06,993
Not like your English lessons.
You were never really interested.

52
00:06:07,118 --> 00:06:09,037
I'm not giving up.

53
00:06:09,162 --> 00:06:11,873
In fact, that guy's going
to take pictures of me.

54
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:15,084
Maybe I'll get into the movies.

55
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:17,503
That'll be the day.

56
00:06:17,837 --> 00:06:20,214
You're horrible, Paul.

57
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:30,725
You're horrible, Paul.

58
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:35,313
You really are.
It's always the same.

59
00:06:35,855 --> 00:06:40,693
You say you love me,
but you don't consider me special.

60
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:46,908
I hardly love you anymore,
but I still consider you special.

61
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:51,537
Why do you say things like that?
I think we're all the same.

62
00:06:52,288 --> 00:06:55,249
You don't approve of me
looking for work?

63
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,961
It suits you even less
than all the rest.

64
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:02,423
Anyway, you're leaving me
because I'm poor.

65
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,051
When all's said and done, maybe.

66
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:09,222
Have you got the pictures
you mentioned on the phone?

67
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,811
I forgot them. They'll be ready
at the end of the week.

68
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,981
Is he all right?
Is he eating well?

69
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:22,527
He had an earache,
but the doctor said it was nothing.

70
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:25,154
What's your job at Pathé-Marconi?

71
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:27,281
I sell records.

72
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:31,244
Can you lend me 2,000 francs?

73
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:33,955
Out of the question.

74
00:07:35,498 --> 00:07:39,168
Your parents
must be glad I'm gone.

75
00:07:39,335 --> 00:07:40,920
No, they liked you.

76
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:42,672
I'll bet.

77
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:46,384
What's that look for?

78
00:07:52,265 --> 00:07:54,225
What's that look for?

79
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:56,060
Nothing.

80
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:59,689
Let's not start quarreling again.

81
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:02,817
How about a game?

82
00:08:02,984 --> 00:08:04,485
Sure.

83
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:11,200
Got a coin?
I only have one.

84
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:12,994
Yes, I do.

85
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:36,100
You go first.

86
00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:00,958
I'm suddenly thinking of those essays
my dad's students write.

87
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,543
What about them?

88
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:06,714
He read us some great ones
last night over dinner.

89
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:11,344
They're just kids. They had
to describe their favorite animals.

90
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:14,847
One little girl of eight
chose a bird.

91
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:17,725
How did it go?

92
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:21,020
"A bird is an animal
with an inside and an outside.

93
00:09:21,187 --> 00:09:23,522
Take away the outside
and the inside is left.

94
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:27,276
Take away the inside
and you see its soul."

95
00:09:37,912 --> 00:09:45,127
THE RECORD SHOP — 2,000 FRANCS —
NANA LIVES HER LIFE

96
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:56,597
No, we're out of that, sir.

97
00:10:02,103 --> 00:10:03,896
What about Judy Garland?

98
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:07,942
We don't have her either.

99
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:15,616
Do you have a guitar recording
by Roméo —

100
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:19,495
What's his name?
Rafael Romero.

101
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:22,540
I'll ask.

102
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:28,045
Rafael Romero on guitar.

103
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,548
In the bins in back.

104
00:10:56,991 --> 00:10:58,701
Is Rita still sick?

105
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:01,495
Yes. I think she'll be back
Thursday.

106
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:03,998
What a drag.
She owes me 2,000 francs.

107
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:11,964
- Can you lend me 2,000?
- You crazy? I'm broke.

108
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:16,093
Why? Anything wrong?
- No, nothing.

109
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,678
Here it is.

110
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:20,389
I'll take this too.

111
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,410
This way, sir.

112
00:12:23,077 --> 00:12:25,037
That looks great.

113
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:28,958
The story's stupid,
but it's very well written.

114
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:33,462
"He gazed at the turquoise,
star-laden sky

115
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:35,589
and then turned to me.

116
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:39,051
'You live your life intensely,
so logically —'

117
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:40,719
I interrupted him.

118
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:43,931
'You attach
too much importance to logic.'

119
00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:49,145
For a few seconds I was filled
with a bitter sense of triumph.

120
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:52,940
No more broken heart,
no more struggle to live again.

121
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:56,986
No probing questions to face
while masking one's defeat.

122
00:12:57,153 --> 00:13:00,865
Yes, a truly elegant way
of breaking this deadlock."

THE CONCIERGE — PAUL —

124

<i>THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC —</i>
A JOURNALIST

125
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:44,575
Please give me my key.

126
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,703
All right, then.

127
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:54,001
Arthur! Get her!

128
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:00,382
Come on, give me the key.

129
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,681
Here, honey.

130
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:13,687
Hi.

131
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,106
Where are you headed?

132
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:18,275
Want to see the pictures?

133
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:30,538
He doesn't look like me at all.
He looks more like you.

134
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:33,040
Come have dinner?

135
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:37,586
- Where are you going?
- Boulevard Saint-Michel.

136
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,339
- Come have dinner.
- I'm not hungry.

137
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:43,175
I want to see a movie.
Bye.

138
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:49,265
JOAN OF ARC

139
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:23,716
We have come
to prepare you for death!

140
00:15:37,021 --> 00:15:39,440
Now... already?

141
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,285
How am I to die?

142
00:15:56,332 --> 00:15:57,833
At the stake!

143
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:15,976
How can you still believe
you were sent by God?

144
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:26,695
God knows our path, but we understand it
only at the end of the road!

145
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,042
Yes, I am his child!

146
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,012
And the great victory?

147
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:01,563
It will be my martyrdom!

148
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:03,857
And your deliverance?

149
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:15,369
Death!

150
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,261
Death.

151
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:43,480
I said good-bye already.

152
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:45,441
I paid for your movie ticket.

153
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:47,276
Too bad.

154
00:17:56,744 --> 00:17:58,746
Evening. How are you?

155
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,581
Evening. How are things?

156
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:03,834
- Didn't we have a date tonight?
- Yes.

157
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:07,671
I wondered if you were coming.
- Why? Am I late?

158
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:11,592
Just a bit.
But that's not why I wondered.

159
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:14,762
I'm usually very punctual.

160
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,640
11:00 p.m. is very late.

161
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:25,898
I thought you'd forgotten too.

162
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:28,650
What will you have?

163
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:31,320
- Any rolls left?
- Sorry, no.

164
00:18:31,487 --> 00:18:33,280
A coffee, then.

165
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:38,744
Was that a friend outside?

166
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:41,121
No, it was my brother.

167
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,874
You have lots
of brothers and sisters?

168
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,919
Five brothers and three sisters.

169
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:50,255
Surprised? It's true.

170
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:55,302
What's new since Wednesday?

171
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,013
Nothing much.

172
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:01,725
Is that red car outside yours?

173
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:04,812
What is it? A Jaguar?

174
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:09,483
No, an Alfa Romeo.
Are you interested in cars?

175
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,820
No, I don't know
a thing about them.

176
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:17,825
When shall we take
those pictures?

177
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:21,995
You tell me.
I already told you I'm ready.

178
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:24,748
But I'm only free on Sundays.

179
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,627
I'm off to London on Sunday.

180
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:31,046
Well then, I don't know.

181
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:36,844
How about now?
Are you tired?

182
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:41,390
If I say no,
you won't think I'm awful?

183
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:43,600
Not at all.

184
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:48,605
Do you really think
I could get into films?

185
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:50,232
I think so.

186
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:53,527
Look, I brought you
a composite sheet.

187
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,789
I'd like to do
something like that.

188
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,209
What's this for?

189
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:12,921
You send it out
to people in films,

190
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:16,884
and a few days later
maybe they call you.

191
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:21,847
I'm a bit shy
about undressing.

192
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:24,600
Just a little.
What can it hurt?

193
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:29,605
Could you lend me 2,000 francs?

194
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:32,065
I would, but I haven't got it.

195
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:35,527
I'm tired.

196
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:42,534
What about my pictures?

197
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:45,537
You'll come with me then?

198
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:08,936
THE POLICE —
NANA IS QUESTIONED

199
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:15,359
<i>Nana Klein-what?</i>

200
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:21,323
K-L-E-I-N...

201
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:28,497
F-R-A-N-K-E-N...

202
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:31,625
H-E-I-M.

203
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:38,340
<i>Born April 15th, 1940,
at Flexburg, Moselle.</i>

204
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:41,218
<i>No fixed address.
Is that right?</i>

205
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:43,136
Yes.

206
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:45,806
<i>All right. What happened?</i>

207
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:49,977
Well, I was walking
down the street,

208
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:53,063
and I saw a woman
buying a magazine.

209
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:58,568
Then... she took some money
out of her bag.

210
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:02,990
She didn't notice
she'd dropped 1,000 francs.

211
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:09,663
So then... I pretended
to buy a magazine too,

212
00:22:10,122 --> 00:22:13,500
and I put my foot
on her 1,000 francs.

213
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:18,338
She left and —

214
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:27,222
And she realized it?

215
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:40,527
She walked back toward me...

216
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,364
and stared into my eyes
for a long time.

217
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:50,412
So I gave her back her money.

218
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:01,381
Then why did she bring charges?

219
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,677
I don't know.
I think it was very mean of her.

220
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:17,314
Don't you have anyone
you can stay with in Paris?

221
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:20,442
Friends, sometimes.

222
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:23,278
Boys?

223
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:28,033
Sometimes.

224
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,706
Why not ask
for an advance at work?

225
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:38,418
I already have, too many times.

226
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:43,381
What are you going to do?

227
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:45,383
I don't know.

228
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:47,302
I...

229
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:50,847
I... is someone else.

230
00:23:56,061 --> 00:24:02,943
THE BOULEVARDS —
THE FIRST MAN — THE ROOM

231
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:10,719
How about it?

232
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:24,482
Is this the place?

233
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:27,235
You've been here before?

234
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:29,905
Yes, it is.

235
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:47,589
Anyone there?

236
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:49,883
<i>You want Room 27 or 28?</i>

237
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:53,553
Room 27.

238
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,463
- Do you smoke?
- No, thanks.

239
00:27:15,927 --> 00:27:17,929
There's never an ashtray.

240
00:27:19,931 --> 00:27:21,725
Here's one.

241
00:27:33,945 --> 00:27:35,864
How much do you want?

242
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:40,160
I don't know.
It's up to you.

243
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:44,873
I don't know.

244
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:48,001
Four thousand francs?

245
00:28:05,977 --> 00:28:07,854
You owe me 1,000.

246
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:09,814
I have no change.

247
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:13,443
Keep it.
It doesn't matter.

248
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:16,571
It's true.
I'm not just trying to get more.

249
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:19,741
But you have
to take everything off.

250
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:30,752
Why not on the mouth?

251
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:44,599
MEETING YVETTE —
A CAFÉ IN THE SUBURBS —

252
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:48,228
RAOUL —
GUNSHOTS IN THE STREET

253
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:06,496
Yvette! How are you?

254
00:29:06,621 --> 00:29:09,499
Is that you? You cut your hair!
- A long time ago.

255
00:29:09,624 --> 00:29:11,084
- How are you?
- And you?

256
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:13,545
- Oh, I'm getting by.
- Me too.

257
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:14,754
Good for you.

258
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:17,674
- Why?
- I thought that —

259
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:21,177
What are you doing here?

260
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:23,388
I'm thirsty.
Shall we get a drink?

261
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:25,014
I'd love to.

262
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,059
How's Raymond?

263
00:29:28,226 --> 00:29:30,770
Oh, I'll tell you all about it.

264
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:33,231
What happened?

265
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:36,192
Life is cruel.

266
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:41,448
I'd like to get away,
escape to the tropics.

267
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:44,284
- Escape is a pipe dream.
- Why?

268
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:46,369
It just is.

269
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,248
This is it.

270
00:29:55,962 --> 00:29:58,089
Shall we sit over there?

271
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:09,642
I'll be back in a minute.

272
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:29,496
So tell me.

273
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:32,207
One evening, Raymond...

274
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,338
came home
with train tickets to Brest.

275
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:42,175
He said he had a job,
so we took the kids and moved

276
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:46,095
and went to live
in a hotel by the harbor.

277
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:50,725
He'd disappear
for the entire day.

278
00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:53,186
He was "working."

279
00:30:53,311 --> 00:30:57,190
I'd take the children out,
buy them ice cream.

280
00:30:58,024 --> 00:31:00,985
I was worried,

281
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:04,697
because I couldn't figure out
how he earned his money.

282
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:09,285
One evening,
after three weeks of that,

283
00:31:10,245 --> 00:31:12,622
he just never came back.

284
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:15,708
I had to manage on my own...

285
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:19,921
with the children that
my mother-in-law wouldn't look after

286
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:22,215
because she didn't like me.

287
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:27,887
I gradually became a prostitute.
It was the easiest way.

288
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:36,104
Then, two years later,
I went to the movies one night...

289
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:41,484
and saw him acting
in an American movie.

290
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:44,654
And things are fine now?

291
00:31:44,821 --> 00:31:46,406
Everything's fine.

292
00:31:46,573 --> 00:31:48,241
What would you like?

293
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:50,702
- White wine.
- Rosé.

294
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:55,081
Still, it doesn't sound
like much fun.

295
00:31:55,248 --> 00:31:58,543
No, it's depressing,
but it's not my fault.

296
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:06,426
I think we're always responsible
for our actions. We're free.

297
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:10,179
I raise my hand —
I'm responsible.

298
00:32:11,097 --> 00:32:14,976
I turn my head to the right —
I'm responsible.

299
00:32:16,394 --> 00:32:20,315
I'm unhappy —
I'm responsible.

300
00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:24,944
I smoke a cigarette —
I'm responsible.

301
00:32:25,862 --> 00:32:30,033
I shut my eyes —
I'm responsible.

302
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:35,246
I forget that I'm responsible,
but I am.

303
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:39,917
I told you
escape is a pipe dream.

304
00:32:40,418 --> 00:32:43,129
After all,
everything is beautiful.

305
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:47,091
You only have to take an interest
in things, see their beauty.

306
00:32:50,094 --> 00:32:51,679
It's true.

307
00:32:51,846 --> 00:32:54,974
After all,
things are just what they are.

308
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:58,144
A face is a face.

309
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:00,980
Plates are plates.

310
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:03,149
Men are men.

311
00:33:03,608 --> 00:33:07,070
And life... is life.

312
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:17,538
The guy I said hello to by the door
wants to meet you.

313
00:33:17,664 --> 00:33:18,915
Would you mind?

314
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:20,583
Not at all.

315
00:33:38,476 --> 00:33:41,020
<i>My girl's not the kind
to be seen</i>

316
00:33:41,187 --> 00:33:43,398
<i>In a chic magazine</i>

317
00:33:43,564 --> 00:33:45,441
<i>That's plain to see</i>

318
00:33:45,608 --> 00:33:48,236
<i>No starlet's
sunglasses or gowns</i>

319
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:50,613
<i>She works across town</i>

320
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,532
<i>In a factory</i>

321
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:55,368
<i>Some plain furnished rooms
are our home</i>

322
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:57,620
<i>We live there alone</i>

323
00:33:57,912 --> 00:33:59,747
<i>She and I</i>

324
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:02,583
<i>A warehouse
and rooftops below</i>

325
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,294
<i>From our little window</i>

326
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,338
<i>Meet the eye</i>

327
00:34:07,588 --> 00:34:09,966
<i>Vacations we spend
close at hand</i>

328
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:12,427
<i>The Riviera's too grand</i>

329
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:14,220
<i>For our pay</i>

330
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:17,056
<i>Loved ones are distant and few</i>

331
00:34:17,223 --> 00:34:19,642
<i>I've a godmother who</i>

332
00:34:19,809 --> 00:34:22,145
<i>Lives far away</i>

333
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,564
<i>But my girl, though just 25</i>

334
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:26,983
<i>Is the sweetest that I've</i>

335
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,068
<i>Ever seen</i>

336
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:31,821
<i>No saint in any church
you could find</i>

337
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:34,282
<i>Is as sweet or as kind</i>

338
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:36,200
<i>At least to me</i>

339
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:39,287
<i>When the town dozes off
in the blaze</i>

340
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:41,748
<i>Of the sun's summer rays</i>

341
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:43,708
<i>Burning bright</i>

342
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:46,419
<i>With my baby girl
wrapped in my arms</i>

343
00:34:46,586 --> 00:34:49,005
<i>I drink in her charms</i>

344
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,882
<i>And hold her tight</i>

345
00:34:51,048 --> 00:34:53,676
<i>We whisper our thoughts, she and I</i>

346
00:34:53,843 --> 00:34:56,345
<i>As light fades from the sky</i>

347
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:58,264
<i>Up above</i>

348
00:34:58,431 --> 00:35:00,933
<i>In the secrecy of our four walls</i>

349
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,478
<i>As night slowly falls</i>

350
00:35:03,603 --> 00:35:05,062
<i>We make love</i>

351
00:35:13,112 --> 00:35:15,364
Is she a lady or a tramp?

352
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:20,912
<i>Insult her. If she's a tramp,
she'll get angry.</i>

353
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:23,122
<i>If she smiles, she's a lady.</i>

354
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:24,791
<i>Raoul.</i>

355
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:32,965
A hot toddy.

356
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:38,846
We'll find out.

357
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,482
You're a friend of Yvette's?

358
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:51,484
That's right.

359
00:35:51,651 --> 00:35:54,654
I know you very well.

360
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:57,532
- You're lying.
- I saw you three months ago.

361
00:35:57,698 --> 00:35:58,866
You're lying.

362
00:35:59,158 --> 00:36:03,162
A guy was showing you pictures
on Boulevard Saint-Germain.

363
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:04,831
That's true.

364
00:36:05,456 --> 00:36:09,335
Then why did you deny it?
You say any old nonsense.

365
00:36:10,378 --> 00:36:12,171
You're pathetic.

366
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,550
Why do you look at me like that?

367
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:19,512
You look stupid,
and your hair looks awful.

368
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:28,187
Wait here.
I need to talk to you.

369
00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:11,230
You okay?

370
00:37:11,397 --> 00:37:12,899
My eyes!

371
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:28,205
THE LETTER — RAOUL AGAIN —
THE CHAMPS-ELYSÉES

372
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:13,918
Dear Madame, a friend who worked
for you gave me your address.

373
00:38:53,666 --> 00:39:00,506
I would like to come
and work for you.

374
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:16,856
I am 22 years old.

375
00:39:31,746 --> 00:39:37,543
I think I am pretty.

376
00:39:44,884 --> 00:39:49,388
My height is...

377
00:40:10,868 --> 00:40:14,371
5'6".

378
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:30,971
I have short hair...

379
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:59,125
but it grows very quickly.

380
00:41:11,971 --> 00:41:19,971
Enclosed is a picture and...

381
00:41:24,483 --> 00:41:26,193
Oh, it's you.

382
00:41:28,571 --> 00:41:30,281
The classic letter.

383
00:41:32,658 --> 00:41:34,160
Yes, it's me.

384
00:41:36,537 --> 00:41:38,664
How did you know I was here?

385
00:41:38,789 --> 00:41:40,457
I followed you.

386
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:44,962
I was in my car,
and I saw you come in here.

387
00:41:45,796 --> 00:41:48,340
You've got some nerve.

388
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:51,218
No, you're very beautiful.

389
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:03,063
You really skipped out quickly
the other day.

390
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,773
When?

391
00:42:04,899 --> 00:42:07,693
When that crook was shot
outside the café.

392
00:42:07,818 --> 00:42:10,154
You just vanished.

393
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:16,785
I don't think they were crooks.
It was some political stuff.

394
00:42:17,995 --> 00:42:20,539
Really? I didn't know.

395
00:42:20,998 --> 00:42:24,835
In any case,
I didn't mean you aren't brave.

396
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:28,047
I was just making conversation.

397
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:42,561
What do you think of me?

398
00:42:42,978 --> 00:42:44,230
Me?

399
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:45,898
Yes, you.

400
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,527
I think there's
a lot of goodness inside you.

401
00:42:50,694 --> 00:42:52,863
What? A lot of what?

402
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:57,326
There's a lot of goodness
in your eyes.

403
00:42:58,327 --> 00:43:01,413
Really?
I didn't understand.

404
00:43:01,747 --> 00:43:04,041
Anyway,
that's an odd thing to say.

405
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:05,751
Why?

406
00:43:13,384 --> 00:43:19,348
I wasn't expecting a Catholic response.
What I meant was:

407
00:43:19,515 --> 00:43:22,768
Do you place me
in a special category of women?

408
00:43:31,193 --> 00:43:33,279
You like being special?

409
00:43:35,656 --> 00:43:37,157
Why?

410
00:43:38,117 --> 00:43:39,827
No reason.

411
00:43:40,494 --> 00:43:43,455
For me, there are
three types of girls:

412
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:51,046
those with one expression,
those with two, and those with three.

413
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:00,556
Did Yvette give you this address?

414
00:44:07,354 --> 00:44:09,481
Are you really serious about it?

415
00:44:09,648 --> 00:44:11,150
Why?

416
00:44:12,443 --> 00:44:14,987
I'd like to earn more money.

417
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:18,824
I can help you earn
even more here in Paris.

418
00:44:18,991 --> 00:44:21,660
Really? Fine with me.

419
00:44:34,715 --> 00:44:38,177
Why not try to get into movies?
You're a pretty girl.

420
00:44:38,344 --> 00:44:40,429
I did try.

421
00:44:40,846 --> 00:44:43,766
Two years ago,
I wanted to make it on the stage.

422
00:44:44,433 --> 00:44:47,519
I was in <i>Pacifico</i>
at the Châtelet.

423
00:44:48,354 --> 00:44:51,565
And I was in a film once
with Eddie Constantine.

424
00:44:52,483 --> 00:44:56,028
I'm telling you my life story.
How awful.

425
00:44:58,489 --> 00:45:01,700
No, it's not. I'm a friend.

426
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:05,204
Give me a smile.

427
00:45:05,329 --> 00:45:07,706
No, I don't feel like it.

428
00:45:47,121 --> 00:45:48,914
Shall I come with you?

429
00:45:58,841 --> 00:46:00,717
<i>When do I start?</i>

430
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:06,140
<i>"When the city lights go on, the
streetwalkers' desperate rounds begin."</i>

431
00:46:13,063 --> 00:46:19,945
AFTERNOONS — MONEY — SINKS —
PLEASURE — HOTELS

432
00:46:22,114 --> 00:46:24,283
<i>What exactly do I do?</i>

433
00:46:24,408 --> 00:46:28,162
<i>The prostitute earns all she can
by trading on her charms</i>

434
00:46:28,328 --> 00:46:32,499
<i>to build up a good clientele and
establish the best working conditions.</i>

435
00:46:35,127 --> 00:46:37,379
<i>Does she have
to be beautiful?</i>

436
00:46:37,546 --> 00:46:42,426
<i>No, although beauty is an important
factor in a prostitute's career.</i>

437
00:46:42,593 --> 00:46:47,848
<i>It establishes her place in the hierarchy
and attracts the attention of the pimp,</i>

438
00:46:48,015 --> 00:46:52,311
<i>since her physical allure can be
a source of great profit.</i>

439
00:46:53,061 --> 00:46:55,522
<i>Does she have
to register somewhere?</i>

440
00:46:55,647 --> 00:46:58,901
<i>Before the law
of April 13th, 1946,</i>

441
00:46:59,026 --> 00:47:01,778
<i>prostitutes were subject to medical
and police surveillance.</i>

442
00:47:01,945 --> 00:47:04,907
<i>Under the new law,
only medical surveillance</i>

443
00:47:05,032 --> 00:47:06,825
<i>is now required.</i>

444
00:47:06,992 --> 00:47:12,247
<i>The 1946 law and Decree 2253
of November 5th, 1947,</i>

445
00:47:12,372 --> 00:47:17,169
<i>established the National Sanitary
Register for all women</i>

446
00:47:17,294 --> 00:47:20,297
<i>shown by conclusive evidence</i>

447
00:47:20,422 --> 00:47:23,800
<i>to be engaged in prostitution.</i>

448
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:27,012
<i>But what do I do?</i>

449
00:47:27,179 --> 00:47:31,016
<i>Regardless of the neighborhood,
the procedure is the same.</i>

450
00:47:31,183 --> 00:47:34,102
<i>By her dress,
attitude, and makeup,</i>

451
00:47:34,228 --> 00:47:36,772
<i>the prostitute indicates
her trade.</i>

452
00:47:36,939 --> 00:47:38,941
<i>Sometimes,
in defiance of the law,</i>

453
00:47:39,107 --> 00:47:43,195
<i>she gestures to the client
or propositions him outright.</i>

454
00:47:44,238 --> 00:47:46,365
<i>What do I charge?</i>

455
00:47:46,532 --> 00:47:48,992
<i>It can vary greatly,</i>

456
00:47:49,117 --> 00:47:51,161
<i>from 300 to 15,000 francs</i>

457
00:47:51,328 --> 00:47:54,206
<i>for an encounter lasting
from a few minutes to an hour</i>

458
00:47:54,373 --> 00:47:56,083
<i>called a "trick."</i>

459
00:47:56,250 --> 00:48:00,212
<i>An "overnight" ranges
from 5,000 to 50,000 francs.</i>

460
00:48:00,712 --> 00:48:03,340
<i>Can I go anywhere I like?</i>

461
00:48:03,507 --> 00:48:07,219
<i>Controls have been attempted.
In Paris, for instance</i>

462
00:48:07,386 --> 00:48:10,180
<i>a police regulation
of August 25th, 1958,</i>

463
00:48:10,347 --> 00:48:15,269
<i>forbids loitering
with intent to solicit</i>

464
00:48:15,435 --> 00:48:19,189
<i>during certain hours
in the Bois de Boulogne</i>

465
00:48:19,314 --> 00:48:21,400
<i>and around the Champs-Elysées.</i>

466
00:48:21,567 --> 00:48:23,777
<i>Do I keep a percentage?</i>

467
00:48:23,986 --> 00:48:28,240
<i>A daily "quota"
is agreed upon in advance.</i>

468
00:48:28,407 --> 00:48:31,076
<i>Around the Champs-Elysées
and the Madeleine,</i>

469
00:48:31,243 --> 00:48:33,245
<i>it's 20,000
to 30,000 francs a day,</i>

470
00:48:33,412 --> 00:48:35,622
<i>paid at the end of the week.</i>

471
00:48:36,081 --> 00:48:38,292
<i>Do I have my own room?</i>

472
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:43,213
<i>Usually only the towels are changed
between tricks, not the sheets.</i>

473
00:48:43,338 --> 00:48:46,883
<i>Some hotels provide no blankets,
only a bottom sheet.</i>

474
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:49,595
<i>What about the police?</i>

475
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:52,889
<i>They conduct raids
and interrogations.</i>

476
00:48:53,015 --> 00:48:56,184
<i>Any woman in violation
of regulations</i>

477
00:48:56,351 --> 00:48:59,855
<i>can be detained in a clinic
as long as necessary</i>

478
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,898
<i>for extensive testing.</i>

479
00:49:03,609 --> 00:49:05,861
<i>Can I have a drink
in a café?</i>

480
00:49:06,028 --> 00:49:09,239
<i>A prostitute who drinks heavily
earns very little.</i>

481
00:49:09,406 --> 00:49:12,784
<i>She's undesirable
because she creates a scene.</i>

482
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,122
<i>What if I get pregnant?</i>

483
00:49:17,247 --> 00:49:20,792
<i>One might think a prostitute
would seek an abortion at any cost.</i>

484
00:49:20,959 --> 00:49:22,753
<i>That's not the case.</i>

485
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:29,926
<i>They do try to avoid pregnancy,
by chemical means or any other.</i>

486
00:49:30,052 --> 00:49:33,805
<i>But once pregnancy is confirmed,
abortions are rare.</i>

487
00:49:35,557 --> 00:49:37,309
<i>Must I accept anyone?</i>

488
00:49:37,476 --> 00:49:42,981
<i>The prostitute must always be
at the client's disposal.</i>

489
00:49:43,106 --> 00:49:45,651
<i>She must accept anyone
who pays.</i>

490
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:47,444
<i>That man...</i>

491
00:49:48,028 --> 00:49:50,155
<i>that man...</i>

492
00:49:54,868 --> 00:49:56,995
<i>Are there clients every day?</i>

493
00:49:57,162 --> 00:49:59,956
<i>Lower-grade prostitutes</i>

494
00:50:00,082 --> 00:50:03,168
<i>average
five to eight clients a day,</i>

495
00:50:03,335 --> 00:50:06,046
<i>earning 4,000 to 8,000 a day.</i>

496
00:50:06,213 --> 00:50:09,508
<i>However, some manage
exceptional turnover.</i>

497
00:50:09,675 --> 00:50:14,179
<i>Sixty clients is not unheard of
on Saturdays or holidays.</i>

498
00:50:14,763 --> 00:50:21,687
A YOUNG MAN — LUIGI — NANA
WONDERS WHETHER SHE'S HAPPY

499
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,772
<i>Do I get days off?</i>

500
00:50:23,897 --> 00:50:27,150
<i>Usually after the medical check.</i>

501
00:50:27,317 --> 00:50:31,238
<i>Her man usually takes her out,</i>

502
00:50:31,363 --> 00:50:34,449
<i>often to see her child
in the country.</i>

503
00:50:34,574 --> 00:50:37,536
<i>Afterwards, they go out
to a restaurant or a movie.</i>

504
00:50:41,707 --> 00:50:43,959
- Is Luigi here?
- Upstairs.

505
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:48,380
I'll be five minutes.

506
00:50:48,547 --> 00:50:50,882
The movie already started anyway.

507
00:50:53,385 --> 00:50:55,011
A white wine.

508
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:09,609
Got any Gauloises?

509
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:30,922
- You have cigarettes?
- Yes. What kind?

510
00:51:31,089 --> 00:51:33,091
I was just wondering.

511
00:52:22,182 --> 00:52:25,393
- Got any cigarettes?
- They've got some downstairs.

512
00:52:33,902 --> 00:52:36,321
- How are you?
- So-so.

513
00:52:36,947 --> 00:52:38,490
What's wrong with her?

514
00:52:38,657 --> 00:52:40,826
We were supposed
to see a movie.

515
00:52:40,992 --> 00:52:42,828
I'll cheer you up.

516
00:52:52,462 --> 00:52:55,715
I'll do the kid
blowing up a balloon.

517
00:53:05,016 --> 00:53:08,520
He's got a balloon,
and he blows it up.

518
00:53:52,731 --> 00:53:55,317
You ought to be my man.

519
00:53:55,567 --> 00:53:57,944
Happy now?
Will you let us talk?

520
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:39,950
THE STREETS — A GUY —
HAPPINESS IS NO FUN

521
00:58:21,833 --> 00:58:25,086
Did you see Inspector Fleytoux?
He bought a BMW.

522
00:58:57,577 --> 00:58:59,787
They could have provided chairs.

523
00:58:59,954 --> 00:59:02,040
It's always like that.

524
00:59:09,422 --> 00:59:10,757
How much?

525
00:59:10,924 --> 00:59:13,676
3,000.
5,000 if I undress.

526
00:59:15,637 --> 00:59:19,515
Can't you give me one more?
- I have to keep some.

527
00:59:20,642 --> 00:59:22,560
- One of these, then?
- It's all I've got.

528
00:59:22,727 --> 00:59:25,647
A little one.
It would be so nice.

529
00:59:28,733 --> 00:59:30,526
You come here often?

530
00:59:32,904 --> 00:59:35,114
But I've seen you before,
haven't I?

531
00:59:35,323 --> 00:59:36,824
Maybe.

532
00:59:40,078 --> 00:59:42,038
What's your name?

533
00:59:42,205 --> 00:59:43,831
Dimitri.

534
00:59:45,083 --> 00:59:46,709
Nice name.

535
00:59:49,128 --> 00:59:51,464
Yes, I'm fond of it.

536
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:54,092
What line of work are you in?

537
00:59:54,259 --> 00:59:57,095
I shoot pictures for ads.

538
00:59:57,262 --> 00:59:59,138
You mean like in the movies?

539
00:59:59,305 --> 01:00:01,266
No, still pictures.

540
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:05,061
I was in a movie with
Eddie Constantine two months ago.

541
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:08,147
<i>No Pity.</i>
Did you see it?

542
01:00:12,527 --> 01:00:16,447
You don't say much.
Are you the romantic type?

543
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:25,290
If you give me more,
you can stay.

544
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:32,880
That's what you want?

545
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:35,717
I'll go see.

546
01:00:43,975 --> 01:00:45,601
Never mind.

547
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:56,654
- Are you leaving?
- Yes.

548
01:00:58,614 --> 01:01:02,493
- Can you spare five minutes?
- Ask Monique. She's in 41.

549
01:01:15,048 --> 01:01:17,800
- What's up?
- Nothing.

550
01:01:20,803 --> 01:01:23,014
The elevators never work.

551
01:01:24,474 --> 01:01:27,018
See you Tuesday
at the Olympia.

552
01:01:42,033 --> 01:01:43,826
- What are you doing?
- Going downstairs.

553
01:01:43,993 --> 01:01:46,871
- Can you spare a moment?
- How much?

554
01:01:47,038 --> 01:01:49,665
I don't know.
We can discuss it.

555
01:01:49,874 --> 01:01:51,334
All right.

556
01:01:51,459 --> 01:01:53,503
Room 45.

557
01:02:14,899 --> 01:02:17,193
Work it out with her.

558
01:02:23,658 --> 01:02:26,160
- All right?
- Yes.

559
01:02:32,083 --> 01:02:35,670
- What's your name?
- Elizabeth. Like the Queen of England.

560
01:02:38,631 --> 01:02:40,883
Shall I strip too?

561
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:42,802
Actually, don't bother.

562
01:02:42,969 --> 01:02:45,221
So you don't need me anymore?

563
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,348
I don't know.

564
01:02:56,566 --> 01:02:58,276
Like that.

565
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:19,297
PLACE DU CHÂTELET — A STRANGER —
NANA, THE UNWITTING PHILOSOPHER

566
01:04:30,952 --> 01:04:33,371
Do you mind me looking?

567
01:04:36,707 --> 01:04:38,543
You look bored.

568
01:04:38,709 --> 01:04:40,169
<i>Not at all.</i>

569
01:04:42,505 --> 01:04:45,174
- What are you doing?
<i>- Reading.</i>

570
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:56,811
Will you buy me a drink?

571
01:04:57,562 --> 01:04:59,272
<i>If you like.</i>

572
01:05:06,112 --> 01:05:07,989
Do you come here often?

573
01:05:08,155 --> 01:05:11,158
Occasionally.
Today I just happened by.

574
01:05:12,994 --> 01:05:14,996
Why are you reading?

575
01:05:15,162 --> 01:05:16,831
It's my job.

576
01:05:22,962 --> 01:05:24,922
It's funny.

577
01:05:25,047 --> 01:05:27,091
Suddenly I don't know what to say.

578
01:05:27,967 --> 01:05:30,011
It happens to me a lot.

579
01:05:30,469 --> 01:05:32,513
I know what I want to say.

580
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:36,892
I think first about whether
they're the right words.

581
01:05:37,351 --> 01:05:42,231
But when the moment comes
to speak, I can't say it.

582
01:05:42,398 --> 01:05:44,775
Yes, of course.

583
01:05:45,443 --> 01:05:47,778
Have you read
<i>The Three Musketeers?</i>

584
01:05:47,945 --> 01:05:51,198
No, but I saw the movie. Why?

585
01:05:53,075 --> 01:05:57,288
Because in it, Porthos —

586
01:05:58,289 --> 01:06:01,500
Actually, this is from
<i>Twenty Years Later.</i>

587
01:06:01,667 --> 01:06:05,588
Porthos is tall, strong,
and a little dense.

588
01:06:06,589 --> 01:06:09,592
He's never had a thought in his life.

589
01:06:10,509 --> 01:06:15,806
He has to place a bomb
in a cellar to blow it up.

590
01:06:15,973 --> 01:06:17,892
He does it.

591
01:06:18,059 --> 01:06:22,480
He places the bomb, lights the fuse,
and starts to run away.

592
01:06:23,189 --> 01:06:26,108
But just then he begins to think.

593
01:06:27,318 --> 01:06:29,236
About what?

594
01:06:29,403 --> 01:06:33,491
How it's possible to put
one foot in front of the other.

595
01:06:33,658 --> 01:06:36,327
I'm sure that's happened to you.

596
01:06:37,995 --> 01:06:42,416
So he stops running.
He can't move forward.

597
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:49,173
The bomb explodes,
and the cellar caves in around him.

598
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:52,510
He holds it up
with his strong shoulders.

599
01:06:52,677 --> 01:06:57,431
But after a day or two,
he's crushed to death.

600
01:06:58,015 --> 01:07:00,601
So the first time he thought,
it killed him.

601
01:07:00,726 --> 01:07:03,479
Why do you tell me
things like that?

602
01:07:04,313 --> 01:07:07,233
No reason. Just to talk.

603
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,902
Why must one always talk?

604
01:07:10,569 --> 01:07:14,782
I think one should often
just keep quiet, live in silence.

605
01:07:16,075 --> 01:07:19,412
The more one talks,
the less the words mean.

606
01:07:19,578 --> 01:07:22,707
Perhaps,
but can one do that?

607
01:07:24,375 --> 01:07:25,376
I don't know.

608
01:07:25,543 --> 01:07:29,296
It's always struck me,
the fact we can't live without speaking.

609
01:07:34,051 --> 01:07:36,804
But it would be nice.

610
01:07:37,388 --> 01:07:40,725
Yes, it would be nice, wouldn't it?

611
01:07:41,726 --> 01:07:44,437
Sort of like we loved
one another more.

612
01:07:44,603 --> 01:07:47,732
But it's impossible.
No one's been able to.

613
01:07:47,857 --> 01:07:49,400
But why?

614
01:07:49,567 --> 01:07:52,737
Words should express
just what one wants to say.

615
01:07:53,404 --> 01:07:55,072
Do they betray us?

616
01:07:56,907 --> 01:07:59,076
Yes, but we betray them too.

617
01:07:59,243 --> 01:08:01,412
One should be able
to express oneself.

618
01:08:01,579 --> 01:08:03,956
We manage
to write things quite well.

619
01:08:04,123 --> 01:08:08,002
It's extraordinary
that someone like Plato

620
01:08:08,169 --> 01:08:12,089
can still be understood.
People really do understand him.

621
01:08:12,256 --> 01:08:16,135
Yet he wrote in Greek
2,500 years ago.

622
01:08:16,302 --> 01:08:21,474
No one really knows
the language, not exactly.

623
01:08:21,807 --> 01:08:26,187
Yet something gets through, so we
should be able to express ourselves.

624
01:08:27,730 --> 01:08:29,774
And we have to.

625
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:33,944
Why do we have to?
To understand each other?

626
01:08:38,616 --> 01:08:40,618
We must think,

627
01:08:41,118 --> 01:08:43,746
and for thought we need words.

628
01:08:43,913 --> 01:08:46,123
There's no other way to think.

629
01:08:46,290 --> 01:08:49,752
To communicate, one must speak.
That's our life.

630
01:08:49,919 --> 01:08:52,505
Yes, but at the same time,
it's very hard.

631
01:08:56,383 --> 01:08:59,637
Whereas I think
life should be easy.

632
01:09:03,307 --> 01:09:07,812
Your tale about the Three Musketeers
may be a very nice story,

633
01:09:08,187 --> 01:09:09,855
but it's terrible.

634
01:09:10,022 --> 01:09:12,775
Yes, but it's a pointer.

635
01:09:14,068 --> 01:09:15,820
I believe

636
01:09:16,737 --> 01:09:22,326
one learns to speak well only when
one has renounced life for a while.

637
01:09:22,493 --> 01:09:25,496
That's the price.
- So to speak is fatal?

638
01:09:25,621 --> 01:09:30,000
Speaking is almost
a resurrection in relation to life.

639
01:09:30,167 --> 01:09:34,338
Speaking is a different life
from when one does not speak.

640
01:09:34,505 --> 01:09:37,800
So to live speaking,

641
01:09:38,342 --> 01:09:41,971
one must pass through
the death of life without speaking.

642
01:09:42,096 --> 01:09:44,974
I don't know if I'm being clear...

643
01:09:46,517 --> 01:09:51,188
but there's a kind of ascetic rule
that stops one from speaking well

644
01:09:51,814 --> 01:09:55,025
until one sees life with detachment.

645
01:09:57,361 --> 01:10:03,117
But one can't live everyday life
with... I don't know —

646
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:05,911
Detachment?

647
01:10:06,078 --> 01:10:10,666
We go back and forth. That's why
we pass from silence to words.

648
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:16,213
We swing between the two,
because it's the movement of life.

649
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:20,718
From everyday life
one rises to a life —

650
01:10:20,885 --> 01:10:25,431
Let's call it superior — why not?
It's the thinking life.

651
01:10:25,598 --> 01:10:29,518
But the thinking life presupposes
that one has killed off

652
01:10:29,685 --> 01:10:32,813
a life that's too mundane,
too rudimentary.

653
01:10:34,648 --> 01:10:38,444
Then thinking and speaking
are the same thing?

654
01:10:38,736 --> 01:10:40,529
I believe so.

655
01:10:40,696 --> 01:10:44,283
It's in Plato, you know.
It's an old idea.

656
01:10:44,450 --> 01:10:48,245
I don't think
one can distinguish a thought

657
01:10:48,412 --> 01:10:50,873
from the words that express it.

658
01:10:50,998 --> 01:10:57,087
A moment of thought can only
be grasped through words.

659
01:10:57,254 --> 01:10:59,882
So to speak is to risk lying?

660
01:11:00,049 --> 01:11:02,968
Lies too are part of our quest.

661
01:11:03,135 --> 01:11:06,430
There's little difference
between an error and a lie.

662
01:11:06,597 --> 01:11:11,185
I don't mean ordinary lies,
like promising,

663
01:11:11,352 --> 01:11:15,773
"I'll be here tomorrow at 5:00,"
and then not showing up.

664
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:17,983
Those are just ploys.

665
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:24,490
But a subtle lie
often differs little from an error.

666
01:11:24,657 --> 01:11:28,619
One's searching for something
and can't find the right word.

667
01:11:28,786 --> 01:11:33,082
That's why you didn't know
what to say before.

668
01:11:33,248 --> 01:11:37,127
I think you were afraid
of not finding the right word.

669
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:43,384
How can one be sure
of having found the right word?

670
01:11:45,844 --> 01:11:49,556
One must work at it.
It only comes with effort.

671
01:11:49,723 --> 01:11:54,269
To say what must be said
in the appropriate way,

672
01:11:54,395 --> 01:11:56,522
that is, that doesn't hurt,

673
01:11:56,647 --> 01:12:00,109
that says what must be said,
does what must be done,

674
01:12:00,234 --> 01:12:02,778
without hurting
or wounding anyone.

675
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:07,616
One must try to act in good faith.

676
01:12:09,076 --> 01:12:10,995
Someone once told me,

677
01:12:11,161 --> 01:12:14,999
"There's truth in everything,
even in error."

678
01:12:15,958 --> 01:12:17,251
It's true.

679
01:12:17,418 --> 01:12:21,338
That's what France didn't see
in the 17th century.

680
01:12:21,505 --> 01:12:26,135
They thought one could
avoid errors and lies,

681
01:12:26,301 --> 01:12:29,471
that one could live
directly in the truth.

682
01:12:29,638 --> 01:12:31,348
I don't think it's possible.

683
01:12:31,515 --> 01:12:34,643
Hence Kant, Hegel,
German philosophy:

684
01:12:34,810 --> 01:12:37,604
to bring us back to life

685
01:12:37,771 --> 01:12:42,985
and make us see that we must pass
through error to arrive at truth.

686
01:12:46,530 --> 01:12:48,866
What do you think about love?

687
01:12:51,577 --> 01:12:55,247
The body had to come into it,

688
01:12:55,414 --> 01:12:58,167
and indeed,
Leibniz introduced the contingent.

689
01:12:58,333 --> 01:13:02,713
Contingent truths
and necessary truths make up life.

690
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:06,884
German philosophy
showed us that in life,

691
01:13:07,051 --> 01:13:11,096
one thinks with the constraints
and errors of life.

692
01:13:11,263 --> 01:13:14,558
One must manage with that.
It's true.

693
01:13:16,685 --> 01:13:20,314
Shouldn't love be the only truth?

694
01:13:22,232 --> 01:13:26,028
But for that,
love would always have to be true.

695
01:13:26,195 --> 01:13:30,240
Do you know anyone who knows
right off what he loves?

696
01:13:31,366 --> 01:13:34,328
No. When you're 20,
you don't know.

697
01:13:34,495 --> 01:13:38,582
All you know are bits and pieces.
You grasp at experience.

698
01:13:38,749 --> 01:13:42,336
At that age, "I love"
is a mixture of many things.

699
01:13:42,503 --> 01:13:48,550
To be completely at one
with what you love takes maturity.

700
01:13:48,717 --> 01:13:50,886
That means searching.

701
01:13:51,053 --> 01:13:53,138
That's the truth of life.

702
01:13:54,723 --> 01:13:57,267
That's why love is a solution,

703
01:13:57,434 --> 01:14:00,646
but on the condition that it be true.

704
01:14:02,481 --> 01:14:10,322
THE YOUNG MAN AGAIN — THE OVAL
PORTRAIT — RAOUL TRADES NANA

705
01:14:20,415 --> 01:14:22,292
What shall we do today?

706
01:14:23,085 --> 01:14:24,378
I don't know.

707
01:14:24,503 --> 01:14:26,797
Shall we go
to the Luxembourg Garden?

708
01:14:29,591 --> 01:14:32,469
I think it's going to rain.

709
01:14:34,513 --> 01:14:38,767
<i>"I thus saw in vivid light
a picture all unnoticed before.</i>

710
01:14:39,726 --> 01:14:43,939
It was the portrait of a young girl
just ripening into womanhood.

711
01:14:44,148 --> 01:14:48,610
I glanced at the painting hurriedly,
and then closed my eyes.

712
01:14:57,494 --> 01:15:01,373
It was an impulsive movement
to gain time for thought,

713
01:15:02,166 --> 01:15:05,210
to make sure that my vision
had not deceived me,

714
01:15:05,377 --> 01:15:10,340
to calm and subdue my fancy
for a more sober and more certain gaze.

715
01:15:11,008 --> 01:15:15,512
In a very few moments
I again looked fixedly at the painting.

716
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:25,939
The portrait, I have already said,
was that of a young girl.

717
01:15:27,065 --> 01:15:29,943
It was a mere head and shoulders,

718
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:34,239
done in what is technically
termed a vignette manner,

719
01:15:34,865 --> 01:15:38,702
much in the style
of the favorite heads of Sully.

720
01:15:38,994 --> 01:15:43,207
The arms, the bosom,
and even the ends of the radiant hair

721
01:15:43,373 --> 01:15:47,461
melted imperceptibly
into the vague yet deep shadow

722
01:15:47,628 --> 01:15:49,922
which formed
the background of the whole.

723
01:15:51,089 --> 01:15:54,176
As a thing of art,
nothing could be more admirable

724
01:15:54,343 --> 01:15:56,595
than the painting itself.

725
01:15:57,262 --> 01:16:00,641
But it could have been
neither the execution of the work,

726
01:16:00,807 --> 01:16:02,893
nor the immortal beauty
of the countenance,

727
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:06,521
which had so suddenly
and so vehemently moved me.

728
01:16:06,688 --> 01:16:11,068
Least of all could it have been that
my fancy, shaken from its half slumber,

729
01:16:11,235 --> 01:16:14,363
had mistaken the head
for that of a living person.

730
01:16:18,242 --> 01:16:22,329
At length, satisfied
with the true secret of its effect,

731
01:16:22,496 --> 01:16:25,082
I fell back within the bed.

732
01:16:25,249 --> 01:16:28,085
I had found the spell of the picture

733
01:16:28,252 --> 01:16:33,423
in an absolute life-likeliness
of expression."

734
01:16:33,757 --> 01:16:35,467
Is that your book?

735
01:16:35,634 --> 01:16:37,636
No, I found it here.

736
01:16:43,809 --> 01:16:45,644
Can I have one?

737
01:16:54,778 --> 01:16:59,366
It's our story:
a painter portraying his love.

738
01:17:00,075 --> 01:17:01,743
Shall I go on?

739
01:17:04,788 --> 01:17:09,001
"And in sooth
some who beheld the portrait

740
01:17:09,126 --> 01:17:12,963
spoke of its resemblance
in low words as of a mighty marvel,

741
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:16,300
and a proof not less
of the power of the painter

742
01:17:16,466 --> 01:17:20,971
than of his deep love for her
whom he depicted so surpassingly well.

743
01:17:21,221 --> 01:17:25,475
But at length, as the labor drew
nearer to its conclusion,

744
01:17:25,642 --> 01:17:28,145
there were admitted none
into the turret.

745
01:17:28,312 --> 01:17:31,398
For the painter had grown wild
with the ardor of his work,

746
01:17:31,565 --> 01:17:37,029
and turned his eyes from the canvas
rarely, even to regard his wife.

747
01:17:37,321 --> 01:17:41,116
And he would not see that the tints
which he spread upon the canvas

748
01:17:41,283 --> 01:17:45,370
were drawn from the cheeks of her
who sat beside him.

749
01:17:45,829 --> 01:17:50,917
And when many weeks had passed,
and but little remained to do,

750
01:17:51,168 --> 01:17:55,130
save one brush upon the mouth
and one tint upon the eye,

751
01:17:55,297 --> 01:17:59,551
the spirit of the lady again flickered up
as the flame within a lamp.

752
01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:04,389
And then the brush was given,
and then the tint was placed.

753
01:18:05,098 --> 01:18:08,101
And, for one moment,
the painter stood entranced

754
01:18:08,268 --> 01:18:10,771
before the work he had wrought.

755
01:18:10,937 --> 01:18:14,107
But in the next, while he yet gazed,

756
01:18:14,274 --> 01:18:16,985
he grew tremulous and aghast,

757
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:21,365
and crying with a loud voice,
"This is indeed Life itself!"

758
01:18:21,531 --> 01:18:24,868
turned suddenly to regard his beloved:

759
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:27,037
She was dead!"

760
01:18:36,171 --> 01:18:38,548
I'd like to go to the Louvre.

761
01:18:38,882 --> 01:18:41,802
No, I don't like looking at pictures.

762
01:18:45,097 --> 01:18:48,475
Why? Art and beauty are life!

763
01:18:52,229 --> 01:18:53,647
I adore you.

764
01:18:54,064 --> 01:18:55,440
And I love you.

765
01:19:03,698 --> 01:19:06,076
Why not come and live with me?

766
01:19:06,535 --> 01:19:08,912
Yes. I'll tell Raoul it's all over.

767
01:19:15,961 --> 01:19:20,215
Let me at least put my coat on
or I'll catch cold!

768
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:22,300
Stop acting hysterical.

769
01:19:29,683 --> 01:19:31,059
No, Raoul, not now!

770
01:19:31,226 --> 01:19:33,186
Stop acting hysterical!

771
01:19:33,645 --> 01:19:35,564
You know each other?

772
01:19:51,955 --> 01:19:53,957
What did I do wrong?

773
01:19:55,083 --> 01:19:57,169
You must take anyone who pays.

774
01:19:57,335 --> 01:20:00,881
Not anyone.
Sometimes it's degrading.

775
01:20:01,673 --> 01:20:03,800
See? That's where you're wrong.

776
01:20:11,224 --> 01:20:15,479
The movies are a drag.
Weekdays we're too busy,

777
01:20:15,645 --> 01:20:18,148
and on Sundays
there's always a line.

778
01:20:21,234 --> 01:20:24,654
- Where are you going?
- Taking them back to their car.

779
01:20:24,821 --> 01:20:27,324
Why did you make me come?

780
01:20:27,866 --> 01:20:29,868
You're going with them.

781
01:20:31,328 --> 01:20:34,331
HADES AND SONS

782
01:21:37,519 --> 01:21:39,354
Well, are you going?

783
01:21:54,828 --> 01:21:56,580
First the girl.

784
01:22:06,256 --> 01:22:07,757
First the money.

785
01:22:12,387 --> 01:22:14,222
Get the money.

786
01:22:47,297 --> 01:22:49,341
There's 100,000 missing.

787
01:22:49,674 --> 01:22:51,259
Don't move.

788
01:22:51,426 --> 01:22:53,720
Don't think I won't shoot
just because of the girl.

789
01:22:53,887 --> 01:22:55,680
No, don't shoot me!

790
01:22:58,642 --> 01:23:01,436
You shoot.
I forgot to load.
