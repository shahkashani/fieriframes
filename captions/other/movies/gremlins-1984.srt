1
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,901
<i>Friends, let me introduce myself.</i>

2
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,487
<i>Peltzer's the name.
Rand Peltzer.</i>

3
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:30,906
<i>That's me there on the corner.</i>

4
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:32,908
<i>I'm an inventor.</i>

5
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,285
<i>And I have a story to tell.</i>

6
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:38,080
<i>I know. Who hasn't got a story?</i>

7
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,166
<i>Well, nobody's got
a story like this one.</i>

8
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,043
<i>Nobody.</i>

9
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,796
<i>It all started here in Chinatown.</i>

10
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,799
<i>I was trying to move
a little merchandise...</i>

11
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,385
<i>...maybe find a present for my kid.</i>

12
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:53,804
<i>I tried this one place.</i>

13
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,102
Wait a minute.

14
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,229
What's down here?

15
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,647
This is it.

16
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:06,316
This is your grandfather's store?

17
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,569
Come on.

18
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,073
No wonder you gotta drag
people in off the street.

19
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,956
Go ahead, mister. Look around.

20
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,333
See if there's something you like.

21
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,229
Are these things real?

22
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:47,065
I told you, everything's real.

23
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,862
You do have interesting
artifacts here...

24
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,947
...but there's one thing
you don't have.

25
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,365
And what's that?

26
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:58,994
Let me show you.
I'm an inventor. I made this.

27
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,789
The Bathroom Buddy.
The invention of the century.

28
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,377
It eliminates the need to carry
heavy luggage when you travel.

29
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,547
You got yourself your shaving mirror...

30
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:14,885
...your toothbrush, a toothpick.
You got toenail clippers...

31
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:16,970
...a nail file...

32
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,806
...and you got yourself a dental mirror.

33
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,184
This is gonna revolutionize traveling.

34
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,270
Let's just say,
for the sake of argument...

35
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,898
...that you're on a bus,
a plane or a train.

36
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,234
You forgot to brush your teeth.

37
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:35,405
You got yourself a bad
case of dragon breath.

38
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,450
Bad breath.

39
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,035
What do you do?

40
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:42,829
No problem, friend. All you do is...

41
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,748
...you take your toothbrush out...

42
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,708
...and you push this button.

43
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,045
That's absolutely no problem.

44
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,798
Cleans up easily.

45
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:55,926
What I'd like to do, sir,
is give you my card.

46
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,429
Rand Peltzer. "Fantastic Ideas
for a Fantastic World."

47
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,139
I make the illogical logical.

48
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,725
I can get you these.

49
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,311
I can get them by the dozen
if you'd like.

50
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,733
What do you think?

51
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:14,945
What do you think?

52
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,950
Where's that coming from?

53
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,137
What is that?

54
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,513
<i>Mogwai.</i>

55
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:45,976
What's he doing?

56
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,394
Singing.

57
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,313
He does that sometimes.

58
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,822
I gotta have him.
He's incredible.

59
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,116
Tell you what I'll do.

60
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,244
- I'll give you $100 for him.
- No.

61
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,789
I've gotta have him. It's a present
for my son for Christmas.

62
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,750
It's what I've been looking for.

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,502
I've been everywhere.
I'll give you $200.

64
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,212
That's $200!

65
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,839
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,092
<i>Mogwai</i> not for sale.

67
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,679
You said everything here was for sale.

68
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:23,889
Grandfather!

69
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,851
With <i>mogwai</i> comes much responsibility.

70
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,396
I cannot sell him at any price.

71
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:40,030
Wait outside. I'll be right out.

72
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,615
Just go.

73
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,127
Okay, mister, here it is.

74
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,546
What about your grandfather?

75
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,549
Forget what he said. He's crazy.
We need the money.

76
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,218
Do you want it or not?

77
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,677
I want it.

78
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,098
<i>There's three rules
you've gotta follow.</i>

79
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:08,725
<i>What kind of rules?</i>

80
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,393
<i>Keep him out of the light.</i>

81
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:13,563
<i>He hates bright light,
especially sunlight.</i>

82
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,940
<i>It'll kill him.</i>

83
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,735
<i>And keep him away from water.
Don't get him wet.</i>

84
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:22,739
<i>But the most important rule,
the rule you can never forget...</i>

85
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:26,201
<i>...no matter how much he cries
or how much he begs...</i>

86
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:30,288
<i>...never, never feed him
after midnight. Got it?</i>

87
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:31,873
<i>Sure. Whatever you say.</i>

88
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,876
<i>Thanks. And have a merry Christmas.</i>

89
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,470
<i>You're rolling with Rockin' Ricky Rialto...</i>

90
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,515
<i>...the voice of Kingston Falls, U.S.A.!</i>

91
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,383
Alex...

92
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,510
Getting close to Christmas.

93
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,054
You'll get stuck with a lot of trees again.

94
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:31,349
- I thought I'd see you about now.
- Ow!

95
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:32,934
What the hell is this?

96
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,645
What are you doing in there?

97
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,397
Don't ask.

98
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,900
Alex, I came to get my tree.

99
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,944
Pete, take that tree
to Mr. Anderson's truck.

100
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,156
What do you say, Alex?

101
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,491
You can spare one
for the sheriff's station.

102
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,244
I paid for mine, Frank.

103
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,002
Billy, you need a jump?

104
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,506
No, thanks, Mr. Futterman.
I'm late for work as it is.

105
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:47,592
These goddamn foreign cars
always freeze up on you.

106
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:51,012
You don't find American
machinery doing that.

107
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,430
See that plow?

108
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,225
Hasn't given me a day's
trouble in 15 years.

109
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,143
You know why?
Kentucky Harvester.

110
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:01,523
It ain't some foreign piece of crap.
That's a Kentucky Harvester.

111
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,026
If I wanna keep my job,
I should be going now.

112
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,987
How's your comic strip coming?

113
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:11,282
I expect to see you in the funnies
with "Smilin' Jack," "Li'l Abner."

114
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,785
They don't run those comics anymore.

115
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,245
They don't?

116
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,247
Come on, Barn.

117
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,958
Say hello to your wife, okay?

118
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,626
So long, Billy.

119
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,091
Goddamn foreign cars.

120
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,616
Hey, doctor.

121
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,201
Morning, Billy.

122
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,850
- Morning, Tom.
- Hey, Billy. Barney.

123
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,322
Get in there and be quiet.

124
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,176
- You just made it.
- Again.

125
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,345
Will you sign this petition?

126
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,430
Sure. What's it for?

127
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,682
To declare Dorry's pub a landmark.

128
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,352
Mrs. Deagle's trying
to take his lease away.

129
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:03,686
His too?

130
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:07,107
Yeah, she says it's a dive,
a public nuisance.

131
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,359
That's where my dad proposed to my mom.

132
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:13,196
That's where everybody's dad proposed
to their mom. Cross your "T."

133
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:18,535
Thanks.

134
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,627
Good morning, Mrs. Deagle.

135
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,462
What's good about it?

136
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,092
Klutz!

137
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,513
Watch it, watch it!

138
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,891
40, 60, 80...

139
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,276
Two hundred. Thank you.

140
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,027
- Mrs. Deagle?
- What?

141
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:56,197
I just wanted you to know
that Joe got another job.

142
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,740
My husband, Joe Harris.

143
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,701
And I've taken up some sewing.

144
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,703
What are you trying to tell me?

145
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:04,914
Neither of us will be
paid for two weeks.

146
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,083
Couldn't you get Mr. Corben...

147
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,460
...to give us a little more time?

148
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,837
Mrs. Harris...

149
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,298
...the bank and I have
the same purpose in life...

150
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,425
...to make money.

151
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,302
Not to support a lot of...

152
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,678
...deadbeats.

153
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,640
Mrs. Deagle, it's Christmas!

154
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,731
Now you know what to ask
Santa for, don't you?

155
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,610
Mommy, I'm hungry.

156
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:36,237
Yes, honey. So am I.

157
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,871
This is what's left of my
imported Bavarian snowman.

158
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,874
Your dog broke it this morning!

159
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,793
I'm terribly sorry.

160
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,545
Tell me how much I owe you...

161
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,339
I don't want money.

162
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,469
I want your dog.

163
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:03,723
Barney?

164
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,517
Give him to me.

165
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,854
I'll take him to the kennel.
They'll put him to sleep.

166
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:13,358
It'll be quick and painless,
compared to what I could do to him.

167
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,526
What could you do?

168
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:21,282
I'll catch the beast myself.

169
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,410
Then he'll get what he deserves.

170
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:27,163
A slow, painful death.

171
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,918
Maybe I'll put him in my
spin dryer on high heat.

172
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,295
That'd do it.

173
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:38,883
Barney!

174
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,551
Barney!

175
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,138
Barney, will you get off of her?

176
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,933
My dear lady, are you all right?

177
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:50,395
I have a very weak heart.
I can't stand a shock like that!

178
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,563
What is that dog doing in here?

179
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,524
This is a bank, not a pet store.

180
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:55,692
Very good, Gerald.

181
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,193
He wouldn't hurt you.

182
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:00,321
Excuses, excuses.
You're just like your father.

183
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:04,826
I've listened to his excuses
for 10 years, the loser!

184
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,954
As for you, you mangy cur...

185
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,039
...I'll get you...

186
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,750
...when you least expect it!

187
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,627
Oh, my heart!

188
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,755
I must apologize for this most unusual...

189
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,632
You putz.

190
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,722
The old bat never looked better.

191
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,849
It's great. You're doing fine.

192
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,684
Thanks.

193
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,561
Hello, Gerald.

194
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,856
If it isn't Captain Clip-on.

195
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:38,484
Guess who almost applied
for unemployment today?

196
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:40,987
- I give up.
- You.

197
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:44,073
But Mr. Corben had second thoughts.

198
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,909
He gets so sentimental
about the holidays.

199
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,828
Imagine that.

200
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,581
I would've fired you in a second.

201
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,083
Merry Christmas to you too.

202
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,127
Excuse me, Mr. Jones.

203
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,464
Hey, Peltzer.

204
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,800
Look, I'm a junior vice president at 23.

205
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,387
By the time I'm 25, I'm gonna
have Mr. Corben's job.

206
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,973
By the time I'm 30,
I'll be a millionaire.

207
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,808
Look at you.

208
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,936
You're practically supporting
your whole family.

209
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,189
The world's changing.

210
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,858
You gotta change with it.
You gotta be tough.

211
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,278
Tough? And no one's
tougher than you, Ger?

212
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,948
Don't call me that.
My name's Gerald.

213
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,450
Can I get you a drink?

214
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,119
Give me a vodka martini.
Shake, don't stir.

215
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,329
You work here?

216
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,123
Weeknights so Dorry doesn't
have to pay an extra waitress.

217
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,291
That's great.

218
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,753
Yeah, that's swell, if you
like working for nothing.

219
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:42,215
Two more rounds for the
pool table, on the house.

220
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,218
You haven't seen my new apartment.

221
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,261
I haven't seen your old apartment.

222
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:51,808
We're talking cable.
Can we have dinner tomorrow night?

223
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:54,727
I'm working.

224
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:59,148
Why don't you tell Dorry you're sick?
He can't dock your pay.

225
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,826
Billy, is that you?

226
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,577
Yeah, Mom, it's me.

227
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,746
I'm in the kitchen.

228
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,500
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

229
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,673
<i>Merry Christmas, movie house!</i>

230
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,342
<i>Merry Christmas, emporium!</i>

231
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,178
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetie.

232
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,013
Do you need any help?

233
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,391
Yeah, you could do the eggs.

234
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,184
Thanks.

235
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:04,964
Dad's machines work so well
the first couple of weeks, then...

236
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,716
Use the sink.

237
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,973
Is something wrong?

238
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:17,101
No, it's a sad movie.

239
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,064
How was your day?

240
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:23,566
It was fine.

241
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,529
Come on, what is it?
What's wrong?

242
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,533
Mrs. Deagle called again this afternoon.

243
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:40,082
Let's not talk about it now.
Don't say anything to Dad.

244
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,542
Fine with me.

245
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,343
Hi, sweetheart!

246
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,181
- Welcome home.
- Hey, Dad.

247
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:59,018
I'm glad you're back.
How was the trip?

248
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,186
It was great.

249
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:03,064
The Miracle Company,
who has the Kitchen Companion...

250
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,150
...might be interested
in the Bathroom Buddy.

251
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,777
Great!

252
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,323
- Thanks!
- You'll like this.

253
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,867
What is it? A birdcage?

254
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,913
No, don't shake it. Open it now.
It won't wait till Christmas.

255
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,459
It's a puppy, isn't it?

256
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,294
Yeah, I can tell.

257
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,963
It's a new car.

258
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:35,805
- Honey, would you dim the lights?
- Sure.

259
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,391
Dim the lights?
Does it glow in the dark?

260
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,102
It's important. Trust me.

261
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,063
Go ahead, open it.

262
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:07,670
What is it?

263
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,463
It's your new pet.

264
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,591
Come on, Barney.
Be a good dog.

265
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,269
You're kidding.

266
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,065
Dad, it's really neat.

267
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,278
Where'd you get this?

268
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,989
Some little junk store in Chinatown.

269
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:38,200
- Can I pick him up?
- Sure, go ahead. Just be careful.

270
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,994
- You gotta be gentle.
- I will.

271
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:42,872
I hope he's housebroken.

272
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,709
Isn't he cute?

273
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,295
Has it got a name?

274
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,713
<i>Mogwai</i>.

275
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,007
- What?
- <i>Mogwai</i>.

276
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,218
Some Chinese word. I just call him...

277
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:59,013
...Gizmo. He seems to like it.

278
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,061
Look up here a minute.

279
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:08,230
We're getting our picture taken.

280
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:09,440
Smile.

281
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,858
Ready?

282
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,736
One, two, three...

283
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,364
- No, no.
- Bright light!

284
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,698
What happened?

285
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,659
He hates bright lights.

286
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:23,245
There's some important
things I forgot to tell you.

287
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:28,584
Number one, he hates bright lights.
You gotta keep him out of the sunlight.

288
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,920
Sunlight will kill him.

289
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,756
Number two, keep him away from water.

290
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:39,095
Don't give him any water to drink.
Whatever you do, don't give him a bath.

291
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,597
And the most important thing...

292
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:45,726
...don't ever feed him after midnight.

293
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,674
Shh!

294
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,345
Looks like you hurt yourself.

295
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,475
Light bright! Light bright!

296
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:14,982
Just sit down there
and don't fall off, okay?

297
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,485
I'll get you fixed up in no time.

298
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,864
All right.

299
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,158
Hold still.

300
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:27,495
Sorry. Sorry.

301
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,087
Try not to move so much, okay?

302
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,525
Good night, Giz.
I'll see you in the morning.

303
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,286
Hello!

304
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:52,913
Mrs. Peltzer?

305
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,459
I got a tree!

306
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,296
Oh, Christ!

307
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,757
Billy!

308
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,307
I just brought in your Christmas tree.

309
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,100
What happened?

310
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:16,395
Slight problem with the
Peltzer Peeler-Juicer.

311
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:19,064
I thought your dad fixed it.

312
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:20,941
I thought so too.

313
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:26,572
You should just buy orange juice
in cartons. It's a lot easier.

314
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,700
See, it works.

315
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,082
<i>- I had to come.
- So I see.</i>

316
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,251
<i>Now I can see. It takes...</i>

317
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,003
<i>...a certain kind of guy.</i>

318
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:44,089
<i>And that guy needs
a certain kind of dame.</i>

319
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,154
It's no problem, Pete.
Leave it up here.

320
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:08,530
What'll you tell him?

321
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:12,743
I'll just tell him a bunch of bikers
stole it from me on my way home.

322
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:18,874
Wow! <i>The Hooded Menace.</i>
Issue number one!

323
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,376
Pretty neat, huh?

324
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,044
Where'd you get it?

325
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:24,755
Dr. Fantasy's, I think.

326
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,884
- What's that?
- Come here. I'll show you.

327
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,553
This is my new pet.
My dad gave him to me.

328
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,055
Neat! What's his name?

329
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,557
His name's Gizmo. Hi, Giz.

330
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,476
He's a <i>mogwai</i>.

331
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:45,401
Cute!

332
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,031
Blink your eyes.

333
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:54,576
Go like that.
Can you do that?

334
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,710
Watch. Maybe he'll sing.

335
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:07,339
Come on, Giz.
Let's go over to the table.

336
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,924
I'll be careful.

337
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,302
There we go.

338
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:18,017
Gee, Billy, where can
I get one of those?

339
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:21,061
I don't know.
This is the only one I've ever seen.

340
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,105
Can I hold him?

341
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:27,109
Sure. I don't see why not.
He seems to like you.

342
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,446
Great! Thanks a lot.

343
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:31,905
Sorry.

344
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,949
What was in that jar?

345
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,701
Nothing! Just water!

346
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,287
Why is he making that noise?

347
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,671
What is it?

348
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:48,964
I don't know.

349
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,471
Is it alive?

350
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,473
I don't know.

351
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,910
One, two, three, four, five new ones.

352
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,663
Now can I have one?

353
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:03,956
I don't know.

354
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:06,708
Look, that one's got
a cute stripe on its head.

355
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,048
Isn't that incredible, Pete?

356
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,134
Yeah, great.

357
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:18,554
Don't you think this...?
This is incredible!

358
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,306
Oh, it is neat.

359
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,726
I'm serious. It's neat.

360
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,066
Gizmo, what's the matter?

361
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,749
- No, no, no.
- Hey, Dad?

362
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:52,087
- There's something I should tell you.
- Look.

363
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,256
You're familiar with the Bathroom Buddy?

364
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,884
I have made an improvement.

365
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,093
Watch this.

366
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:02,264
Now, let's say you're
late for the big meeting.

367
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,849
It's really important.

368
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:08,061
You're on your way. You reach up.
You forgot to shave.

369
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,273
What're you gonna do?
Under normal circumstances...

370
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,275
...you are in trouble.

371
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:16,236
But not if you have the Bathroom Buddy.

372
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,280
Watch this.

373
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,867
What do you think?

374
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:24,119
That's pretty neat.

375
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:26,872
What's this button?

376
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,628
- Sorry, Dad.
- It's okay.

377
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:33,837
I'm sorry.

378
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:37,549
It's not your fault. I'm working on that.
I haven't finished that.

379
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:41,261
I came up here because there's
a problem with the <i>mogwai</i>.

380
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,013
Yeah, what's that?

381
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,308
It multiplies with water.

382
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:49,561
What?

383
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,399
Do you see what I mean?

384
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,152
I don't believe that.

385
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,279
All that from water?
They got wet?

386
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:00,822
Plain water.

387
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,329
It's funny.
The new ones aren't like Gizmo.

388
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,665
The striped one seems to be the leader.

389
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:10,916
You know what?

390
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:14,419
I'll bet every kid in America
would like one of these.

391
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,172
They might replace the dog
as the family pet.

392
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:30,018
Think about it.

393
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,145
The Peltzer Pet.

394
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:37,567
This could really be the big one.

395
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,381
Barn?

396
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,884
Barney?

397
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,577
Barney?

398
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:33,248
Barney, who did this to you?

399
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,208
Hold on, I'll get you down.

400
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:36,752
Stay still.

401
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:41,590
Poor dog. Another minute and
he would've been a dog-sicle.

402
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:47,220
All I know is that I'm positive
that I closed and locked the door.

403
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,349
How else did she get to him?

404
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:54,728
We can't point any fingers,
not even at Mrs. Deagle.

405
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:58,899
She's been threatening him.
She'd love to get her hands on him.

406
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:04,237
We don't have proof. We can't even find
footprints leading up to the house.

407
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:08,950
I'm gonna take Barney
to your grandmother's.

408
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:12,746
Take him there on the way to the convention,
pick him up on the way home.

409
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:16,625
He'll be here for Christmas.
It'll be all right.

410
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,299
I don't think we can drink this.

411
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:30,597
Why not?

412
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,682
What's wrong with this?

413
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,317
Hey, Billy.

414
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,152
Is that a <i>mogwai</i>?

415
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,322
Yeah, I'm gonna have
Mr. Hanson check it out.

416
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:51,243
And all of a sudden, there were
five new ones like this one.

417
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,579
Now watch this.

418
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:35,287
Can I keep one of these here,
run some tests on him?

419
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,457
I think I can spare one.

420
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:50,552
This is some Christmas,
Katie, I'll tell you.

421
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,807
First the old bat closes the factory,
and now it's my goddamn plow.

422
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:59,060
Mr. Futterman, guess what?
It's time to go home now.

423
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:01,521
- How about one more beer?
- No, it's late.

424
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,648
One more beer, I'll help you clean up.

425
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:06,568
No, thanks, though.
It'll be okay.

426
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:12,032
- It'll be okay.
- It will not be okay.

427
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,411
I brought my plow in for a tune-up
and found it loaded with foreign parts.

428
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:19,915
I mean, everything.
Gaskets, pistons, spark plugs.

429
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:22,000
All of it's foreign.

430
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,252
- Billy!
- Hi.

431
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,839
Going home?

432
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:29,424
Oh, yeah.

433
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:34,846
Gremlins!

434
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,266
You gotta watch out for foreigners.

435
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,810
They plant gremlins in their machinery.

436
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:44,856
The same gremlins brought down
our planes in the big one.

437
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,067
That's right.

438
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:48,818
World War II.

439
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,028
Good old...

440
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:52,614
...W-W-I-I.

441
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:59,120
They're still shipping them over here.

442
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:01,206
They put them in the cars, the TV.

443
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:04,125
They put them in the radios
you stick in your ears.

444
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,254
They put them in the watches.
Little teeny gremlins.

445
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:10,966
It's not a good idea that you drive.
Why don't you walk home?

446
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:14,386
You know, Katie, I think
maybe I'll walk home.

447
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:17,639
- Good.
- It's a nice night.

448
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,311
- Good night, kids.
- Good night.

449
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,108
Gremlins.

450
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:58,179
That was really good, the way
you handled Mr. Futterman.

451
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,181
I'm used to it.

452
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:03,518
He's been like that ever
since he lost his job.

453
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:08,940
He's like a lot of people around here.
He just wants somebody to listen.

454
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:11,026
Especially around the holidays.

455
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,653
Why is that?

456
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:16,698
It's when a lot of people
get really depressed.

457
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:22,704
I always thought everyone was happy
during the holidays, no matter what.

458
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,540
Most people are, but some aren't.

459
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:29,878
While everybody else opens up presents,
they're opening up their wrists.

460
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:32,213
Cheery thought.

461
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:36,051
It's true. The suicide rate's always
the highest around the holidays.

462
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,429
Now I'm depressed.

463
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,806
Do you ever get depressed on Christmas?

464
00:35:43,183 --> 00:35:45,060
I don't celebrate Christmas.

465
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,686
Are you Hindu or something?

466
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:48,813
No, I just don't like to.

467
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:52,734
What's not to like?
I mean, it's a lot of fun.

468
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:54,069
God!

469
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,821
Say you hate Thanksgiving,
and nobody cares.

470
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:01,534
But say you hate Christmas, everybody
makes you feel like you're a leper.

471
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:05,997
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

472
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:10,502
I'm sorry.
I'm just a little tired and cranky.

473
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:12,045
Yeah.

474
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:17,425
Thanks for walking me home.

475
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,678
No problem.

476
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:21,554
- Good night.
- Good night.

477
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:23,765
Kate?

478
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:30,563
I was just wondering, do you get
any free nights off from Dorry's?

479
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,191
Thursdays.

480
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,694
Thursdays, yeah.

481
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,488
Because I was just wondering...

482
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:43,201
...if you're free this Thursday night,
maybe you'd like to go out on a date...

483
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,328
...with me?

484
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:46,621
I'd love to.

485
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,749
Oh, yeah?

486
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,584
Well, that's great!

487
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:57,382
We can talk about it
on the phone and kind of...

488
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,592
...square everything away.

489
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:03,138
Good night, Billy.

490
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,647
'Night.

491
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:31,875
Hey there.

492
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:37,547
Give me your arm, boy.
Come here, come on.

493
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,675
Give me your arm.
No, this is not gonna hurt.

494
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,386
This isn't gonna hurt.

495
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:47,140
Not a big guy like you. Come on.

496
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:51,269
There you go.
See, that's not so bad. Come on.

497
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:54,397
Good, good.
Oh, that's good.

498
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:58,526
Just a little blood test, pal.
You'll never miss it.

499
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:05,033
<i>They're like huge seedpods!</i>

500
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,083
- Having fun?
- Fun!

501
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,543
Pretty neat, huh?

502
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:16,920
Neat!

503
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:20,465
Yum, yum! Yum, yum!

504
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,222
How about shutting up
for a change, okay?

505
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,057
I already fed you.

506
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:38,233
Well, it's not 12:00 yet.

507
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,946
All right. Keep an eye on them, Giz.
I'll be back in a second.

508
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,593
Here we go.

509
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:08,763
Now maybe you guys will be quiet.

510
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:21,276
You guys are really hungry.

511
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:25,947
Giz, you want some?

512
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:31,369
Do you want some chicken?

513
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,122
No?

514
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,665
All right.

515
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,299
Yum, yum.

516
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:57,645
That's it, good buddy.
Call it a night.

517
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,853
<i>Can't you see?
They're after you!</i>

518
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:42,690
<i>They're after all of us!
Our wives, our children, everyone!</i>

519
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:46,527
<i>They're here already!
You're next!</i>

520
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:51,449
<i>You're next!
You're next! You're next!</i>

521
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,084
Uh-oh.

522
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,837
- Mom?
- Yeah?

523
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:07,340
Mom, could you come up here, please?

524
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:16,724
Then I want you to bring
the vacuum cleaner upstairs for me.

525
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,149
What are they?

526
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:29,070
Well, they're the <i>mogwai</i>, I guess.

527
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,655
Except for Gizmo.

528
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:34,242
Did you get them wet?

529
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:36,619
No.

530
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:40,373
Did you feed them after midnight?

531
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,625
Well, I gave them some chicken.

532
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,419
But I made sure that it...

533
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:48,089
No, no, no. Wait a minute.

534
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:50,091
I made sure...

535
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:58,182
Mom?

536
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:00,268
What's going on here?

537
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:03,479
Yuck!

538
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,525
What'd you say this was called?

539
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,610
A putrid stage?

540
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:12,530
Pupal. Pupal stage.

541
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,323
Like a butterfly.

542
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:15,575
Yeah, right.

543
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:20,538
This is a cocoon, and inside
he's going through changes.

544
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:22,999
Lots of changes.

545
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:24,917
Like my mother.

546
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:27,628
No, that's different.

547
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:31,340
This is called a metamorphosis.

548
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,718
It's a change in form...

549
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,970
...and in appearance.

550
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,155
Hello?

551
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:04,749
Hello? Hi, honey!

552
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:06,375
No, I'm sure it works fine.

553
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,836
I was just out on the back
porch for a second.

554
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:11,380
The convention's great.

555
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,219
I said it's great!

556
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:18,012
Actually, the competition's...

557
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:19,222
Sorry, miss.

558
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:22,266
The competition's a little more
advanced than I expected.

559
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:26,395
- I was changing my oil.
- Some really neat things.

560
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,734
Oh, Rand.

561
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:35,696
You've never been so far away
on Christmas Eve before.

562
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:38,699
I know it's Christmas Eve.

563
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:41,702
I'll do the best I can.

564
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:43,704
All right. Bye-bye.

565
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:48,084
All I could get for it was $36!

566
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:52,046
If there's anything I can do...
But it's completely out of my hands.

567
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:53,798
I'll be delighted...

568
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:57,051
Hello, Gerald.
I'm under such terrible pressure.

569
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:00,054
Why don't you just speak
to Mrs. Deagle about it?

570
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:02,557
Speak to Mrs. Deagle?

571
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:06,561
Mrs. Deagle!

572
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,147
Deposit this to my account.

573
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,157
Where's that psychotic canine?

574
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:21,325
Still hiding under the counter?

575
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:24,078
No, I'm afraid he's on vacation.

576
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:27,248
Better keep him behind locked doors,
because if I catch him...

577
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:29,750
...he's in for a slow death.

578
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:39,260
<i>Here's Mr. Bird's heart.</i>

579
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,973
<i>Small animals lose heat
faster than large ones.</i>

580
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:47,435
<i>Their blood must circulate faster
to keep their bodies warm.</i>

581
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:48,853
<i>Now, in small birds...</i>

582
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,939
<i>...their hearts beat about
600 times per minute.</i>

583
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:54,192
<i>Cats, 130.</i>

584
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:55,985
<i>Man, about 75...</i>

585
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:59,947
<i>...and a big old elephant's heart,
only 25 a minute.</i>

586
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:03,284
<i>Hey, doc, you got a human heart?</i>

587
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:08,164
<i>Has he got a human heart?
Wait till you see this! Roll 10.</i>

588
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:17,858
Okay, class. Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

589
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,194
If any of you wanna bring me
a present...

590
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:22,655
...a cassette deck wouldn't be bad.

591
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:25,950
Of course, tickets to the Super Bowl
would be very nice.

592
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:30,162
Mr. Hanson, wait.
Let me just talk to you for a second.

593
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,249
Bye.

594
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:03,779
Billy...

595
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:07,825
It just hatched.

596
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:09,785
I'll be right there.

597
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,433
Hey there.

598
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,980
You remember me?

599
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:47,114
Remember me, don't you?

600
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,617
I went and got you...

601
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:52,495
...a candy bar.

602
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:54,997
I thought you might be hungry.

603
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,750
You hungry?

604
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:05,341
You should try one of these.

605
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:21,899
Hey there.

606
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:26,362
Come here. Don't be afraid.
There's no reason to be afraid.

607
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:28,989
Where'd you go?

608
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,993
Where are you?
I know you're in there.

609
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:35,037
I know you're under there.

610
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,374
Come on, now.

611
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:42,420
You're not still angry about
that little blood test, are you?

612
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:45,881
Come on out.
Take a bite. Let me see you.

613
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:48,717
I just wanna see you.

614
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:54,849
You try some of this now.
I know you gotta be hungry.

615
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:58,352
Yum, yum.

616
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:03,065
There now. Don't you feel better?

617
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,715
Mr. Hanson?

618
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,788
Yum, yum.

619
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:45,477
Gizmo ca-ca!

620
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:33,817
Billy, are you okay?
Where are you?

621
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,654
Mom, they hatched.
Get out of the house.

622
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:39,239
Phone home. Ca-ca!

623
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:42,409
Mom? Mom!

624
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:32,227
Yum, yum.

625
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:11,225
Get out of my kitchen!

626
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,799
Neat!

627
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:28,695
Hey!

628
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:36,495
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

629
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:47,756
Mom, it's Stripe!

630
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:01,937
- Should I get it?
- Yeah, go ahead and get it.

631
00:58:02,354 --> 00:58:04,022
Oh, I didn't mean that.

632
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:07,985
Hello, Dr. Molinaro.
Can we come in?

633
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:10,278
My mom's had a bit of an accident.

634
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:14,241
Be careful!

635
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:15,909
What happened?

636
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:26,795
Giz?

637
00:58:40,976 --> 00:58:42,853
Bright light! Bright light!

638
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:44,479
Come here.

639
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,565
They almost got you, huh?

640
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:48,859
Climb in here.

641
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:54,906
The question is totally without meaning.

642
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:58,452
Pardon me, sir. Stuff.

643
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:01,580
Thick and heavy.

644
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:04,499
Would 60 gallons be sufficient?

645
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:08,795
I rarely use it myself, sir.
It promotes rust.

646
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:21,391
Don't worry, Giz, we'll find him.

647
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:40,947
Gremlins, huh?

648
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:43,158
- Little monsters.
- Right.

649
01:01:43,325 --> 01:01:47,579
- Hundreds of them?
- I'm not sure. Maybe thousands.

650
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:51,791
Look, I know it sounds crazy.
I know it does.

651
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,587
But in a matter of hours,
this town's gonna be a disaster area.

652
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:57,255
You've got to warn people!

653
01:01:57,464 --> 01:02:00,508
- You think this kid is drunk?
- No, but you are.

654
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:01,968
I am not drunk!

655
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:06,348
Tell me something. Where do
these little gremlins come from?

656
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:07,724
All right.

657
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:11,353
My father gave me one as a present.

658
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:15,106
Does your father always give
you vicious little monsters?

659
01:02:15,315 --> 01:02:18,109
No, they don't start out vicious at first!

660
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:19,569
Of course not.

661
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:23,031
They don't! They look like this.

662
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:25,951
Could you dim the lights?

663
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,661
Sure.

664
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:30,497
Go ahead, Brent. Dim the lights.

665
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:41,800
Gusto!

666
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:06,825
Right, Murray?

667
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:18,503
Sheila, will you quit
messing with the TV?

668
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:21,423
You have the thingy.

669
01:03:25,844 --> 01:03:27,679
Goddamn foreign TV.

670
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:32,017
We should've got a Zenith!

671
01:03:43,403 --> 01:03:44,654
Foreigners.

672
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:51,036
I can't get a damn thing on this!

673
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:53,121
Where are you going?

674
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:56,541
I'm gonna check the antenna.
Maybe the damn thing blew down.

675
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:58,460
Be careful, dear.

676
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:18,355
What the hell is that?

677
01:05:04,776 --> 01:05:07,320
- It's them!
- You're crazy!

678
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:10,281
There's a real gremlin in my cab!

679
01:05:42,147 --> 01:05:44,732
Hello, Anderson.
Wanna mail something, do you?

680
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:46,943
Just a last-minute package, Father.

681
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:48,486
Be my guest.

682
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:51,990
That's strange.

683
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:23,146
Patriotic little fellow, ain't he?

684
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:25,356
Waving the flag and everything.

685
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:30,111
Be careful, Frank!
He might tear your arm off.

686
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,489
You want me to put the cuffs on him?

687
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:35,241
Tell me. How come a cute guy like this...

688
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:37,952
...can turn into a thousand ugly monsters?

689
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:41,247
You see, this is before it
enters the pupal stage.

690
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:42,707
It multiplies with water.

691
01:06:44,292 --> 01:06:47,003
- Get the kid some water.
- I wouldn't do that.

692
01:06:47,212 --> 01:06:48,713
Sheriff's office.

693
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:50,798
Yeah, speaking.

694
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:54,302
What?

695
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:58,014
Oh, no.

696
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:01,226
Yeah, sure, we'll be right over.

697
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:03,311
What happened?

698
01:07:03,895 --> 01:07:05,146
The Futtermans.

699
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:09,442
Something about a snowplow.
A freak accident.

700
01:07:09,651 --> 01:07:10,985
It's the creatures!

701
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:14,572
The creatures are making it
look like an accident!

702
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:17,408
Will you listen to me?

703
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:19,369
You listen to me, kid!

704
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:21,746
Go on home, take little Gizmo...

705
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:25,250
...sit by the fireplace and open
your Christmas presents.

706
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:26,876
Attaboy.

707
01:07:27,669 --> 01:07:29,546
- Let me drive.
- No, you're drunk.

708
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:30,838
You always drive!

709
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:33,258
Because I'm the sheriff, asshole.

710
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:52,735
Kopeck, you stop that, you bad kitty!

711
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:55,488
Kopeck's a bad kitty.

712
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:57,949
Ruble's a good little kitty.

713
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:03,329
We'll find you something to eat.
She's a good kitty.

714
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,585
Here we go. Here we go. Come on.

715
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:10,336
All right, you stop that!

716
01:08:10,545 --> 01:08:12,130
Stop it!

717
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:19,053
Mean kitty, you start eating
before everybody gets here.

718
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:20,930
Come on, Dollar Bill.

719
01:08:21,139 --> 01:08:23,850
Yes, here we go, Dollar Bill.

720
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:27,312
Mommy'll fix you something good to eat.

721
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,938
Everybody here?

722
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:32,066
All right, let go of Mommy's coat.

723
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:33,276
Here.

724
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:40,491
Christmas carolers.

725
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,870
I hate Christmas carolers.

726
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:47,999
Screechy-voiced little glue-sniffers.

727
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:51,753
I warned you brats!

728
01:08:52,879 --> 01:08:54,714
Ya-ya-ya! Ya-ya-ya!

729
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:08,519
What are they?

730
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:10,730
What are they?!

731
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:17,987
They're here!

732
01:09:18,196 --> 01:09:21,366
They've come for me!
They've come!

733
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:25,620
I'm not ready.

734
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:28,831
I'm not ready yet.
I'm not ready!

735
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:56,192
My God, Frye!

736
01:09:56,567 --> 01:09:57,985
That was Mrs. Deagle.

737
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:08,871
Get them off! Get them off! Help me!

738
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:13,000
That's Dave Myers.
He does Santa every year.

739
01:10:18,131 --> 01:10:20,174
What the hell is he doing now?

740
01:10:21,008 --> 01:10:23,094
What's that stuff
he's got all over him?

741
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,890
Frank, I really think we should go now.

742
01:10:28,099 --> 01:10:31,269
Start the car. I'd really like
to go back to the station.

743
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:34,105
Please!

744
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:38,735
Frank!

745
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:04,135
Jesus, Frank!

746
01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:05,970
What the hell are those things?

747
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:10,600
It's Christmas.
What the hell's going on?

748
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:11,934
Shut up, will you?!

749
01:11:40,254 --> 01:11:41,923
I don't believe it.

750
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:48,262
<i>You're on with Rockin' Ricky! Go!</i>

751
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:50,223
<i>Hi, my name's Pete.</i>

752
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:53,476
<i>These green guys are running
around wrecking things.</i>

753
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:56,103
<i>This is Christmas, not Halloween!</i>

754
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:57,396
<i>Listen, gang.</i>

755
01:11:57,688 --> 01:12:00,900
<i>Rockin' Ricky's getting fed up
with this Orson Welles crap!</i>

756
01:12:01,108 --> 01:12:04,821
<i>What's that? Kitty, what's that?
Some of Rockin' Ricky fans?</i>

757
01:12:05,196 --> 01:12:07,615
<i>You're not a Rockin' Ricky fan!</i>

758
01:12:31,889 --> 01:12:35,393
Sir, I notice that you're a smoker.

759
01:12:36,143 --> 01:12:39,939
I notice that you're a smoker.
I see the cigarettes.

760
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:43,484
I noticed, here, this broken ashtray.

761
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:47,113
It's very fortunate
that I happened to come by.

762
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:51,075
Let me introduce myself.
My name's Randall Peltzer. I'm an inventor.

763
01:12:51,284 --> 01:12:54,620
"Fantastic Ideas for a Fantastic World."
I make the illogical logical.

764
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:58,416
I have something here that I think
you might be interested in.

765
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,626
Yes, sir, I do.

766
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,461
This is...

767
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:05,298
...the Peltzer Smokeless Ashtray.

768
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:08,467
I think this can solve
your problem here, sir.

769
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:03,189
Please don't bite me!

770
01:14:04,357 --> 01:14:05,691
Wait a minute.

771
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:32,731
You all right?

772
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:34,400
Let's get out of here!

773
01:17:37,862 --> 01:17:39,071
What's that?

774
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:42,158
Don't worry. He's with me.
He's not one of them.

775
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:50,708
What's wrong?
Why isn't the car starting?

776
01:17:51,542 --> 01:17:54,044
We're gonna have to make
a run for it, okay?

777
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:56,589
One, two, three!

778
01:18:30,956 --> 01:18:32,625
They've been here too.

779
01:18:33,459 --> 01:18:36,337
What are these things?
Where do they come from?

780
01:18:37,796 --> 01:18:39,715
They're gremlins, Kate.

781
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:43,260
Just like Mr. Futterman said.

782
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:52,436
Now I have another reason
to hate Christmas.

783
01:18:53,312 --> 01:18:54,813
What are you talking about?

784
01:18:55,773 --> 01:19:00,319
The worst thing that ever happened
to me was on Christmas.

785
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:03,322
Oh, God. It was so horrible.

786
01:19:06,825 --> 01:19:08,661
It was Christmas Eve.

787
01:19:09,328 --> 01:19:10,996
I was 9 years old.

788
01:19:12,498 --> 01:19:15,292
Me and Mom were decorating the tree...

789
01:19:16,001 --> 01:19:18,045
...waiting for Dad
to come home from work.

790
01:19:19,838 --> 01:19:21,632
A couple hours went by.

791
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,509
Dad wasn't home.

792
01:19:23,884 --> 01:19:26,512
So Mom called the office.
No answer.

793
01:19:27,972 --> 01:19:32,685
Christmas Day came and went,
and still nothing.

794
01:19:34,395 --> 01:19:36,647
So the police began a search.

795
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:39,400
Four or five days went by.

796
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:42,486
Neither one of us could eat or sleep.

797
01:19:43,362 --> 01:19:45,322
Everything was falling apart.

798
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:48,701
It was snowing outside.

799
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:54,039
The house was freezing, so I went
to try to light up the fire.

800
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:56,417
That's when I noticed the smell.

801
01:20:00,838 --> 01:20:03,716
The firemen came and broke
through the chimney top.

802
01:20:03,882 --> 01:20:08,053
And me and Mom were expecting
them to pull out a dead cat or a bird.

803
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:11,056
And instead they pulled out my father.

804
01:20:15,394 --> 01:20:18,731
He was dressed in a Santa Claus suit.

805
01:20:19,606 --> 01:20:22,109
He'd been climbing down the chimney...

806
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:24,611
...his arms loaded with presents.

807
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:27,072
He was gonna surprise us.

808
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:33,370
He slipped and broke his neck.
He died instantly.

809
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:40,419
And that's how I found out
there was no Santa Claus.

810
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:47,760
Don't worry about that smoke.
It'll stop. It's guaranteed.

811
01:20:58,228 --> 01:20:59,730
Barney, shut up!

812
01:20:59,938 --> 01:21:02,358
Don't start with me.
I got a long way to go.

813
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:04,151
Shut up!

814
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:01,333
Where did they all go?

815
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:03,335
It'll be light soon.

816
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:05,712
I bet they're all together someplace dark.

817
01:22:14,304 --> 01:22:15,722
<i>Mogwai</i>!

818
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:28,193
Shh, Gizmo.

819
01:22:45,878 --> 01:22:47,337
They're inside.

820
01:22:47,546 --> 01:22:48,964
All of them?

821
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:56,680
Milk Duds.

822
01:24:18,262 --> 01:24:19,680
What are they doing?

823
01:24:21,139 --> 01:24:23,141
They're watching <i>Snow White</i>.

824
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:25,769
And they love it.

825
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:35,070
Where's the boiler room?

826
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:36,989
It's in the back of the theater.

827
01:24:50,794 --> 01:24:52,170
Down there.

828
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:03,181
Milk Duds.

829
01:25:26,747 --> 01:25:29,166
Yum, yum.

830
01:25:39,885 --> 01:25:42,387
Cover your mouth.
Don't breathe any gas.

831
01:25:57,402 --> 01:25:58,487
Billy!

832
01:25:58,654 --> 01:25:59,905
Go.

833
01:26:23,261 --> 01:26:24,429
Billy!

834
01:26:42,406 --> 01:26:43,573
Billy!

835
01:26:45,117 --> 01:26:48,954
- Hurry up!
- Move, Katie! Watch out!

836
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:52,916
Come on!

837
01:27:31,997 --> 01:27:32,998
Billy...

838
01:27:33,373 --> 01:27:35,459
In the department store.

839
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:37,794
Stripe!

840
01:28:06,823 --> 01:28:09,493
That's Stripe. He's the leader.

841
01:28:12,037 --> 01:28:14,873
If he gets to water,
it'll start all over again.

842
01:28:31,807 --> 01:28:36,561
Take Giz, go back and try and
find some kind of light switch.

843
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:50,075
Careful, Billy.

844
01:30:00,937 --> 01:30:03,189
<i>Ward is your snowplow headquarters.</i>

845
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:29,424
<i>Attention, Christmas shoppers.</i>

846
01:30:29,633 --> 01:30:34,471
<i>Saturday morning at 8:30, we'll have
Santa Claus for all the kiddies.</i>

847
01:30:49,319 --> 01:30:51,655
<i>We have the Kingston Falls...</i>

848
01:30:53,073 --> 01:30:54,699
<i>Attention, shoppers.</i>

849
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:19,242
Light bright!

850
01:32:26,666 --> 01:32:28,835
Bye-bye.

851
01:33:26,976 --> 01:33:28,895
<i>It takes a certain kind of guy.</i>

852
01:33:29,104 --> 01:33:31,940
<i>And that guy needs
a certain kind of dame.</i>

853
01:34:26,661 --> 01:34:29,581
Water!

854
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:33,585
Gun!

855
01:34:34,169 --> 01:34:36,963
<i>It's been a rough night
for Rockin' Ricky...</i>

856
01:34:37,672 --> 01:34:40,550
<i>...but he's still on the air!</i>

857
01:34:40,925 --> 01:34:43,887
<i>The Marines are standing by
with fire hoses.</i>

858
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:32,393
Billy.

859
01:36:26,948 --> 01:36:29,450
Gizmo ca-ca!

860
01:36:29,659 --> 01:36:31,703
Light bright! Light bright!

861
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:13,036
What the hell is that?

862
01:37:25,089 --> 01:37:26,090
Your scarf.

863
01:38:29,362 --> 01:38:30,822
<i>We switch to a report...</i>

864
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:34,075
<i>...from the scene
of the Christmas Eve riots.</i>

865
01:38:35,618 --> 01:38:39,580
<i>This is Lew Landers,
WDHB's Action Central News...</i>

866
01:38:39,789 --> 01:38:41,833
<i>...at the site of Dorry's Tavern...</i>

867
01:38:42,208 --> 01:38:45,628
<i>...or what used to be Dorry's Tavern,
in Kingston Falls...</i>

868
01:38:45,837 --> 01:38:47,255
<i>...where officials blame...</i>

869
01:38:47,463 --> 01:38:51,342
<i>...mass hysteria for the escalating
series of unexplained...</i>

870
01:38:51,551 --> 01:38:55,930
<i>...accidents, fires and explosions
that rocked this once-peaceful town...</i>

871
01:38:56,472 --> 01:38:57,932
<i>...on Christmas Eve.</i>

872
01:38:58,141 --> 01:39:01,227
<i>The bizarre demise
of Mrs. Ruby Deagle, widow...</i>

873
01:39:01,436 --> 01:39:04,772
...of convicted stock-swindler
Donald Deagle...

874
01:39:05,231 --> 01:39:07,150
Don't chew that.

875
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:08,693
Don't chew.

876
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:13,573
I bet he'd like some chicken soup.

877
01:39:19,203 --> 01:39:23,499
Honey, this is the gentleman
who sold me the <i>mogwai</i>.

878
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,879
"Sold." An interesting choice of words.

879
01:39:32,258 --> 01:39:35,678
<i>Conflicting eyewitness reports
concerning "little green men"...</i>

880
01:39:38,181 --> 01:39:42,268
You teach him to watch television?

881
01:39:48,191 --> 01:39:50,818
There was, I believe, a box.

882
01:40:00,411 --> 01:40:01,579
Dad...

883
01:40:12,048 --> 01:40:13,758
Rand, your scarf.

884
01:40:15,801 --> 01:40:16,969
I warned you.

885
01:40:17,595 --> 01:40:20,890
With <i>mogwai</i> comes much responsibility.

886
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:22,558
But you didn't listen.

887
01:40:22,808 --> 01:40:25,144
And you see what happens.

888
01:40:25,353 --> 01:40:27,188
I didn't mean it.

889
01:40:27,396 --> 01:40:30,816
You do with <i>mogwai</i> what your society...

890
01:40:31,067 --> 01:40:35,196
...has done with all of nature's gifts.

891
01:40:35,404 --> 01:40:37,532
You do not understand.

892
01:40:39,992 --> 01:40:41,369
You are not ready.

893
01:40:52,171 --> 01:40:53,714
- Papa?
- Yes?

894
01:40:57,301 --> 01:40:59,512
He has something to say to you.

895
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:08,854
You understand what he says
when he speaks to you?

896
01:41:09,063 --> 01:41:12,358
To hear, one has only to listen.

897
01:41:16,195 --> 01:41:17,780
Bye, Billy.

898
01:41:23,786 --> 01:41:26,831
Perhaps someday you may be ready.

899
01:41:27,039 --> 01:41:28,958
Until then, <i>mogwai</i>...

900
01:41:29,375 --> 01:41:30,918
...will be waiting.

901
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:35,506
Excuse me, sir.

902
01:41:36,382 --> 01:41:38,467
Before you go, I wanted to tell you...

903
01:41:38,718 --> 01:41:41,512
...that I am truly sorry
for what's happened.

904
01:41:42,013 --> 01:41:44,932
And if you would accept it,
I'd like to...

905
01:41:45,141 --> 01:41:47,143
...give you this small token.

906
01:41:47,435 --> 01:41:50,730
There's one other one.
This is an invention of mine.

907
01:41:50,938 --> 01:41:52,982
Smokeless Ashtray.

908
01:41:53,190 --> 01:41:54,233
How did you know?

909
01:41:54,442 --> 01:41:57,361
Man at gas station tried to sell me.

910
01:41:57,612 --> 01:42:00,323
Latest word in technology.

911
01:42:00,906 --> 01:42:03,075
Very generous of you.

912
01:42:03,284 --> 01:42:06,162
I'm sure it will come in handy.

913
01:42:12,918 --> 01:42:14,712
Bye-bye, woof-woof.

914
01:42:32,313 --> 01:42:34,607
<i>Well, that's the story.</i>

915
01:42:35,191 --> 01:42:39,737
<i>So if your air conditioner goes on the fritz,
