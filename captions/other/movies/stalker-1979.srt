4
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:42,251
What was it? A meteorite?

5
00:03:42,334 --> 00:03:47,042
A visit from inhabitants of the cosmic abyss?

6
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:51,209
One way or another, our small country

7
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:54,501
has seen the birth of a miracle - the Zone.

8
00:03:54,584 --> 00:03:57,792
We immediately sent troops there.

9
00:03:57,876 --> 00:04:00,042
They haven't come back.

10
00:04:00,126 --> 00:04:04,376
Then we surrounded the Zone
with police cordons...

11
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:08,709
Perhaps, that was the right thing to do.
Though, I don't know...

12
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:12,001
From an interview with
Nobel Prize winner, Professor Wallace.

13
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:13,709
Why did you take my watch?

14
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:19,542
Where are you going, I'm asking you?

15
00:10:22,584 --> 00:10:26,792
You gave me your word, and I believed you.

16
00:10:31,584 --> 00:10:35,917
All right, you're not thinking about yourself,
but what about us?

17
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:38,709
Did you think about your child?

18
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:44,334
She's just getting used to you,
and you start it again!

19
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:52,126
You've made an old woman of me.
You've ruined my life.

20
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:55,334
Not so loud, you'll wake up Monkey.

21
00:10:56,834 --> 00:10:59,959
I can't wait for you forever. I'm going to die!

22
00:11:14,376 --> 00:11:16,542
You wanted to start working.

23
00:11:18,042 --> 00:11:21,251
You've been promised
normal, respectable work.

24
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:27,167
I'll be back soon.

25
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:30,667
You'll be back in prison!

26
00:11:30,751 --> 00:11:33,459
Though this time,
you'll get 10 years, not five.

27
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:37,751
And for 10 years, you will have nothing.
Neither your Zone, nor anything else.

28
00:11:38,834 --> 00:11:43,001
And I'll be dead in the meantime.

29
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:48,459
Oh, God. For me, everywhere is a prison.

30
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:54,251
- Let me go.
- No.

31
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:56,542
Let go, I said.

32
00:12:06,876 --> 00:12:11,042
Go! And may you rot there!

33
00:12:12,584 --> 00:12:16,167
Damn the day I met you, you bastard!

34
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:20,834
God himself has cursed you
by giving you this child!

35
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:25,417
And me too, because of you, you scoundrel!

36
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:15,792
<i>My dear, our world is hopelessly boring.</i>

37
00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:20,084
<i>Therefore, there can be no telepathy
or apparitions or flying saucers,</i>

38
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:23,001
<i>nothing like that.</i>

39
00:13:23,084 --> 00:13:27,751
<i>The world is ruled by cast-iron laws,
and it's insufferably boring.</i>

40
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:30,376
<i>Alas, those laws are never violated.</i>

41
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:32,751
<i>They don't know how to be violated.</i>

42
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:39,376
So don't even hope for a UFO,
that would have been too interesting.

43
00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:43,126
And how about the Bermuda Triangle?
You're not going to deny...

44
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:47,459
I am. There is no Bermuda Triangle.

45
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:53,042
There's only Triangle ABC that equals
Triangle A-prime, B-prime, C-prime.

46
00:13:53,126 --> 00:13:56,542
Do you feel the boredom
contained in this assertion?

47
00:13:57,792 --> 00:14:00,834
To live in the Middle Ages was interesting.

48
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:05,376
Every home had its house-spirit,
and every church had its God.

49
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:09,626
People were young!
Now every fourth is an old person.

50
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:12,626
It's so boring, my angel.

51
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:16,042
But you said that the Zone

52
00:14:16,126 --> 00:14:18,042
was the product of a superior civilisation...

53
00:14:18,126 --> 00:14:23,334
it must be boring too,
all those laws, triangles,

54
00:14:23,417 --> 00:14:27,167
and no house spirits,
and no God, that's for certain.

55
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:32,501
Because if God is also a triangle,

56
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:36,417
then I don't know what to think.

57
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:42,292
It's for me! Great!

58
00:14:42,376 --> 00:14:45,251
Goodbye, my dear friend.

59
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:49,376
This lady was so kind
as to agree to go with us to the Zone.

60
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:52,584
She's a very courageous woman.
Her name is...

61
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:56,042
I beg your pardon, your name is...

62
00:14:56,126 --> 00:14:58,834
Are you really a stalker?

63
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:07,501
Wait, I'll explain everything.

64
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:17,584
Go.

65
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:27,501
What a cretin!

66
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:34,209
You did get drunk after all.

67
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:36,959
Me? What do you mean?

68
00:15:37,042 --> 00:15:40,376
I had a drink,
like one-half of the population does.

69
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:45,251
The other half gets drunk,
including women and children.

70
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:47,292
I just had a drink, though.

71
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:11,667
Damn it, what a mess.

72
00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:28,376
Go on, drink. We've got time.

73
00:16:30,834 --> 00:16:34,417
How about one for the road?

74
00:16:36,251 --> 00:16:38,084
What do you think?

75
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:56,376
- Take it away.
- I see. Dry law.

76
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:58,876
Alcoholism is a scourge of mankind.

77
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,126
All right, we'll drink beer.

78
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:05,334
Is he with us?

79
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:10,167
Never mind, he'll sober up.
He needs to go there too.

80
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:19,917
Are you really a professor?

81
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,459
If you don't mind.

82
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:26,834
Then let me introduce myself. My name is...

83
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:28,792
Your name is Writer.

84
00:17:29,542 --> 00:17:31,876
Well done. And what is my name?

85
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:34,542
Yours? Professor.

86
00:17:35,584 --> 00:17:38,584
I see. I'm a writer,

87
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:42,084
so, naturally, everyone calls me
Writer for some reason.

88
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:45,917
- And what do you write about?
- About the readers.

89
00:17:46,001 --> 00:17:48,376
Obviously, there's nothing else
one should write about.

90
00:17:48,459 --> 00:17:52,001
One should write about nothing at all.

91
00:17:52,834 --> 00:17:57,084
And what are you? A chemist?

92
00:17:57,959 --> 00:17:59,834
A physicist.

93
00:17:59,917 --> 00:18:03,667
That must be boring too.
Searching for the truth.

94
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:09,292
It's hiding and you keep searching for it.

95
00:18:09,376 --> 00:18:13,376
You dig in one place. Eureka!
The nucleus is made of protons.

96
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,584
You dig in another. Great!

97
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:20,417
Triangle ABC equals
Triangle A-prime, B-prime, C-prime.

98
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:22,209
With me, it's quite different.

99
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:29,417
While I am digging for the truth,
so much happens to it

100
00:18:29,501 --> 00:18:31,959
that instead of discovering the truth,

101
00:18:32,042 --> 00:18:36,167
I dig up a heap of, pardon...
I'd better not name it.

102
00:18:42,126 --> 00:18:44,334
You're lucky!

103
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:47,709
But imagine some antique pot
displayed in a museum.

104
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:50,584
It was used in its time
as a receptacle for leftover food,

105
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:54,500
but now it's an object of universal admiration

106
00:18:54,584 --> 00:18:57,584
for its laconic pattern and unique form.

107
00:18:58,459 --> 00:19:00,542
Everyone goes, "Oh!" and "Ah!"

108
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:04,792
And suddenly it turns out
that it's not antique at all,

109
00:19:06,001 --> 00:19:09,834
that some joker has palmed it off
on the archaeologists

110
00:19:11,001 --> 00:19:12,501
just for fun.

111
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:17,126
Strange as it may seem, the admiration
dies off. Those connoisseurs...

112
00:19:17,209 --> 00:19:19,959
Is this what you think about all the time?

113
00:19:22,084 --> 00:19:23,667
God forbid!

114
00:19:24,209 --> 00:19:27,084
In fact, I don't think much.
It's not good for me.

115
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:32,001
It's impossible to write,
thinking all the time of success or failure.

116
00:19:33,501 --> 00:19:37,459
But if no one is going to read me
in a hundred years,

117
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:40,084
why the hell should I write at all?

118
00:19:41,459 --> 00:19:46,792
Tell me, Professor, why did you
let yourself get mixed up in all this?

119
00:19:46,876 --> 00:19:48,709
What do you need the Zone for?

120
00:19:51,042 --> 00:19:54,167
One could say that I'm a scientist.

121
00:19:56,292 --> 00:19:58,376
But what do you need it for?

122
00:19:59,709 --> 00:20:01,584
You're an "in" writer.

123
00:20:02,459 --> 00:20:05,334
Women must be running after you in flocks.

124
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:10,209
My inspiration has been lost, Professor.
I go begging for it.

125
00:20:11,876 --> 00:20:14,001
Have you been used up?

126
00:20:14,084 --> 00:20:18,209
What? Yes, I suppose, in a way.

127
00:20:20,292 --> 00:20:23,751
Do you hear it? Our train.

128
00:20:31,042 --> 00:20:34,417
- Have you taken the roof off the car?
- Yes, I have.

129
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:48,667
<i>Luger .</i>

130
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:54,417
If I don't come back, call on my wife.

131
00:21:09,292 --> 00:21:12,417
Damn it, I forgot to buy cigarettes.

132
00:21:13,792 --> 00:21:15,542
Don't go back.

133
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,501
- Why?
- You must not.

134
00:21:19,584 --> 00:21:22,876
- You're all like this.
- Like what?

135
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:25,334
Believing such nonsense.

136
00:21:26,334 --> 00:21:28,834
Well, I'd better save it for a rainy day.

137
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:34,376
Are you really a scientist?

138
00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:13,084
Down!

139
00:23:16,792 --> 00:23:18,542
Don't move!

140
00:23:48,834 --> 00:23:51,126
Go and look. ls there anyone there?

141
00:23:56,459 --> 00:23:58,751
Move it, for God's sake!

142
00:24:04,459 --> 00:24:06,251
There's no one there.

143
00:24:06,376 --> 00:24:08,376
Go to the other exit.

144
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:37,292
Where on earth did you look, Writer?

145
00:26:48,917 --> 00:26:51,001
Take a look around, please.

146
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:51,042
- You didn't forget the jerry can?
- No. It's full.

147
00:28:04,709 --> 00:28:07,001
Everything I told you before

148
00:28:08,292 --> 00:28:12,834
is a lie.
I don't give a damn about inspiration.

149
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:20,542
How would I know
the right word for what I want?

150
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:25,459
How would I know that actually
I don't want what I want?

151
00:28:25,542 --> 00:28:30,001
Or that I actually don't want
what I don't want?

152
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,001
They are elusive things.

153
00:28:33,084 --> 00:28:37,251
The moment we name them,
their meaning disappears,

154
00:28:37,334 --> 00:28:41,542
melts, dissolves like a jellyfish in the sun.

155
00:28:41,626 --> 00:28:45,417
My conscience wants vegetarianism
to win over the world.

156
00:28:45,501 --> 00:28:48,876
And my subconscious is yearning
for a piece of juicy meat.

157
00:28:49,834 --> 00:28:51,917
But what do I want?

158
00:28:54,126 --> 00:28:57,209
- World domination.
- Quiet!

159
00:29:01,001 --> 00:29:03,459
Why is there a diesel locomotive in the Zone?

160
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:06,542
It services the outpost.
It won't go any further.

161
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:09,792
They don't like going there.

162
00:29:15,792 --> 00:29:19,084
Take your places! Everybody here?

163
00:29:21,584 --> 00:29:25,709
The guards have arrived.
Tell them to turn the TV off.

164
00:30:32,584 --> 00:30:33,917
Hurry!

165
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:35,417
Go and look to see whether
there's a trolley on the tracks.

166
00:31:35,501 --> 00:31:38,042
- What trolley?
- Go, go...

167
00:32:00,709 --> 00:32:02,834
Go back, I'll do it.

168
00:33:58,959 --> 00:34:00,334
<i>The 'yew; ca“!</i>

169
00:34:25,584 --> 00:34:27,126
Give it to me!

170
00:34:29,209 --> 00:34:31,959
Get rid of your knapsack, it's hampering you.

171
00:34:32,042 --> 00:34:35,834
You can travel light, if you wish,
as if you were going for a stroll.

172
00:34:37,626 --> 00:34:40,876
If someone gets hit,
don't shout or rush about.

173
00:34:40,959 --> 00:34:43,084
If they see you, they'll kill you.

174
00:34:43,167 --> 00:34:47,084
When everything settles down,
crawl back to the outpost.

175
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:49,001
They'll pick you up in the morning.

176
00:35:04,834 --> 00:35:06,542
Can they catch up with us?

177
00:35:06,626 --> 00:35:10,292
They fear it like the plague.

178
00:35:11,417 --> 00:35:12,959
Fear what?

179
00:39:32,792 --> 00:39:34,459
Here we are,

180
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:37,417
home at last.

181
00:39:40,626 --> 00:39:42,292
How quiet it is.

182
00:39:44,792 --> 00:39:50,542
This is the quietest place in the world.
You'll see for yourselves.

183
00:39:52,917 --> 00:39:56,792
So beautiful here. Not a single soul.

184
00:39:56,876 --> 00:39:58,417
What about us?

185
00:39:58,501 --> 00:40:01,709
Three men can't spoil the place in one day.

186
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:04,501
Why? They can.

187
00:40:07,792 --> 00:40:12,459
It's strange that the flowers don't smell.
Or have I...

188
00:40:13,667 --> 00:40:15,084
Do you feel anything?

189
00:40:15,167 --> 00:40:18,001
The bog stinks, that's what I feel.

190
00:40:18,084 --> 00:40:20,876
No, that's the river. There's a river here.

191
00:40:21,917 --> 00:40:27,667
There was a flower bed nearby,
but Porcupine had trampled it down.

192
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:33,417
The smell lingered for many years though.

193
00:40:34,876 --> 00:40:37,584
Why did he do it?

194
00:40:38,501 --> 00:40:40,292
I don't know.

195
00:40:41,709 --> 00:40:43,626
I asked him why, too.

196
00:40:44,751 --> 00:40:47,459
And he said, "You'll understand later."

197
00:40:48,959 --> 00:40:53,626
I think he just came to hate the Zone.

198
00:40:57,001 --> 00:41:01,167
Porcupine, that's his name?

199
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:04,334
A nickname, like yours.

200
00:41:05,584 --> 00:41:10,042
He had been taking people to the Zone
for years, and no one could stop him.

201
00:41:10,126 --> 00:41:14,917
He was my teacher. He opened my eyes.

202
00:41:17,417 --> 00:41:22,209
He was called Teacher then, not Porcupine.

203
00:41:24,292 --> 00:41:29,042
Then something happened to him,
something broke in him.

204
00:41:31,251 --> 00:41:33,626
Though I think he was punished.

205
00:41:33,709 --> 00:41:37,876
Will you help me?
Tie those strips of bandage to the nuts.

206
00:41:38,876 --> 00:41:42,626
And I will go for a walk.

207
00:41:44,751 --> 00:41:47,084
I need to do something.

208
00:41:59,376 --> 00:42:02,501
Don't go anywhere.

209
00:42:08,334 --> 00:42:10,251
Where's he going?

210
00:42:11,251 --> 00:42:13,459
He wants to be alone, I suppose.

211
00:42:13,542 --> 00:42:18,084
Why? Even with the three of us together,
I feel uncomfortable.

212
00:42:20,584 --> 00:42:23,917
A date with the Zone. He's a stalker.

213
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:27,959
And what does that mean?

214
00:42:28,042 --> 00:42:32,834
You see, being a stalker
is some sort of calling.

215
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:36,501
- I thought he'd be different.
- Like what?

216
00:42:36,584 --> 00:42:41,459
Well, you know, the Leatherstocking Tales,
Chingachgook, that sort of thing...

217
00:42:41,542 --> 00:42:45,042
His background is even more frightful.

218
00:42:45,126 --> 00:42:48,751
Several times in prison,
then he was harmed here.

219
00:42:48,834 --> 00:42:52,292
He has a mutant daughter,
"a victim of the Zone" as they call it.

220
00:42:52,376 --> 00:42:54,917
They say she's got no legs.

221
00:42:58,334 --> 00:43:00,792
And what about this Porcupine?

222
00:43:01,959 --> 00:43:04,667
What do you mean, "was punished"?

223
00:43:05,501 --> 00:43:08,001
Or was it just a figure of speech?

224
00:43:10,209 --> 00:43:15,209
One day Porcupine returned from here

225
00:43:16,334 --> 00:43:18,417
and got rich overnight.

226
00:43:20,417 --> 00:43:24,167
- Fabulously rich.
- You call that punishment?

227
00:43:25,792 --> 00:43:28,876
A week later, he hanged himself.

228
00:43:28,959 --> 00:43:30,626
Why?

229
00:43:30,834 --> 00:43:32,084
Quiet!

230
00:43:35,084 --> 00:43:37,542
What was that?

231
00:45:32,501 --> 00:45:37,709
Presumably a meteorite fell here
about 20 years ago.

232
00:45:38,667 --> 00:45:41,209
It had burned down the settlement.

233
00:45:42,209 --> 00:45:46,709
They searched for this meteorite
but never found it, of course.

234
00:45:47,876 --> 00:45:50,876
Why "of course"?

235
00:45:50,959 --> 00:45:53,751
Then people began disappearing here.

236
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:57,417
They came here and never returned.

237
00:45:59,292 --> 00:46:02,126
So it was concluded

238
00:46:02,209 --> 00:46:07,792
that this meteorite was not really a meteorite.

239
00:46:07,876 --> 00:46:09,626
At first,

240
00:46:12,292 --> 00:46:17,751
they circled the place with barbed wire
to scare off the inquisitive.

241
00:46:20,626 --> 00:46:25,876
All this gave rise to rumours
that there's a place in the Zone

242
00:46:28,709 --> 00:46:31,376
where wishes come true.

243
00:46:31,459 --> 00:46:37,792
Naturally, they began to guard the Zone
like the apple of their eye.

244
00:46:39,917 --> 00:46:44,001
Who knows what kind of wish
someone might cherish.

245
00:46:44,084 --> 00:46:47,834
What was it if not a meteorite?

246
00:46:51,001 --> 00:46:53,292
I told you, no one knows.

247
00:46:54,334 --> 00:46:57,042
And what do you think?

248
00:46:58,459 --> 00:47:02,459
Nothing. Or anything.

249
00:47:04,542 --> 00:47:08,001
A message to mankind,
as one of my colleagues says.

250
00:47:08,834 --> 00:47:10,917
Or a gift.

251
00:47:15,459 --> 00:47:17,542
Some gift.

252
00:47:18,584 --> 00:47:20,667
Why on earth would they do it?

253
00:47:20,751 --> 00:47:23,709
To make us happy.

254
00:47:27,251 --> 00:47:31,417
The flowers are blooming again,
but they don't smell for some reason.

255
00:47:32,459 --> 00:47:37,959
Sorry for leaving you two here,
but it was too early to go anyway.

256
00:47:42,042 --> 00:47:44,501
Did you hear it?

257
00:47:44,584 --> 00:47:47,167
Maybe someone lives here?

258
00:47:48,209 --> 00:47:49,751
Who?

259
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:54,001
You told me yourself

260
00:47:54,084 --> 00:47:59,584
about some tourists camped here
when the Zone originated.

261
00:47:59,667 --> 00:48:02,501
There's no one in the Zone
and there can't be.

262
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:09,251
Well, it's time.

263
00:48:55,251 --> 00:48:58,084
How are we going to get back?

264
00:48:58,167 --> 00:49:02,042
- Here, you don't get back.
- What do you mean?

265
00:49:02,917 --> 00:49:05,584
We'll go as we agreed.

266
00:49:11,042 --> 00:49:13,792
I'll direct you.

267
00:49:13,876 --> 00:49:17,001
Any deviation
from my directions is dangerous.

268
00:49:18,584 --> 00:49:22,084
The first landmark is that last pole.

269
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:26,042
You go first, Professor.

270
00:49:37,834 --> 00:49:39,501
Now you.

271
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:50,209
Try to follow in his footsteps.

272
00:51:08,834 --> 00:51:12,209
My God! And where are...

273
00:51:12,292 --> 00:51:17,001
Did they remain here like that?
Those people?

274
00:51:17,084 --> 00:51:19,751
Who knows?

275
00:51:19,834 --> 00:51:25,834
I remember them packing at the station,
getting ready to come here.

276
00:51:25,917 --> 00:51:28,292
I was just a boy.

277
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:33,251
We all thought then that
somebody wanted to conquer us.

278
00:51:39,292 --> 00:51:41,542
You first, Professor.

279
00:51:49,667 --> 00:51:51,834
Now you, Writer.

280
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:27,251
Your room is over there. We'll go this way.

281
00:54:27,334 --> 00:54:32,001
Why were you hiking up the price?
It's so close at hand.

282
00:54:33,376 --> 00:54:37,126
Yes, but the hand has to be very long.

283
00:54:38,334 --> 00:54:40,876
We don't have such a hand.

284
00:55:47,334 --> 00:55:49,167
Don't! Leave it alone!

285
00:55:50,751 --> 00:55:52,876
Don't touch it!

286
00:55:55,959 --> 00:55:58,251
Don't touch it, I said!

287
00:55:58,334 --> 00:56:03,167
Are you crazy? What's the matter with you?

288
00:56:04,917 --> 00:56:07,792
This is not the place for leisurely strolls.

289
00:56:08,876 --> 00:56:11,751
The Zone wants to be respected.
Otherwise, it will punish.

290
00:56:11,834 --> 00:56:17,334
Don't you ever try it again.
Have you no tongue or what?

291
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:21,001
I warned you, didn't I?

292
00:56:21,084 --> 00:56:22,792
Is that where we're going?

293
00:56:24,751 --> 00:56:27,751
Yes. Go up, then go in and to the left.

294
00:56:27,834 --> 00:56:34,084
Only, we are not going this way.
We'll go around.

295
00:56:34,167 --> 00:56:35,792
Why?

296
00:56:37,042 --> 00:56:38,709
People don't go this way.

297
00:56:38,792 --> 00:56:42,667
In the Zone, the longer way means less risk.

298
00:56:43,751 --> 00:56:45,667
And to go straight ahead is fatal?

299
00:56:45,751 --> 00:56:47,376
He told you it's dangerous.

300
00:56:47,459 --> 00:56:51,417
- And making a detour's not dangerous?
- It is. But they don't go this way.

301
00:56:51,501 --> 00:56:54,959
What do I care that they don't?
What if I take a chance...

302
00:56:55,042 --> 00:56:56,626
Listen, what's the matter with you...

303
00:56:56,709 --> 00:57:00,542
To go all the way around!
When everything's so close.

304
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:03,959
There are risks everywhere. What the hell!

305
00:57:04,042 --> 00:57:07,917
You're being very flippant about this.

306
00:57:09,542 --> 00:57:12,709
I'm fed up with all those nuts and bandages.

307
00:57:12,792 --> 00:57:16,667
You can do as you wish, but I'm going.

308
00:57:16,751 --> 00:57:20,209
- You're insane.
- It's you who are...

309
00:57:20,292 --> 00:57:21,959
May I?

310
00:57:34,001 --> 00:57:36,042
The wind is getting up.

311
00:57:37,459 --> 00:57:41,001
Can you feel it? The grass...

312
00:57:49,001 --> 00:57:52,917
All the more so.

313
00:57:53,001 --> 00:57:55,001
What do you mean?

314
00:58:11,376 --> 00:58:14,084
- Wait!
- Keep your hands off!

315
00:58:15,042 --> 00:58:21,917
Professor, be my witness,
I didn't send you there.

316
00:58:22,001 --> 00:58:24,167
You go of your own will.

317
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:27,376
Of my own will. What else?

318
00:58:27,459 --> 00:58:30,334
Nothing. Go.

319
00:58:36,876 --> 00:58:39,167
May God bring you luck.

320
00:58:53,792 --> 00:58:55,709
Listen!

321
00:58:55,792 --> 00:58:58,584
Should you notice something,

322
00:58:58,667 --> 00:59:01,792
or just feel something,

323
00:59:01,876 --> 00:59:04,876
go back at once, or...

324
00:59:04,959 --> 00:59:07,959
Just don't throw iron poles at me.

325
01:00:17,167 --> 01:00:18,751
Stop! Don't move!

326
01:00:23,834 --> 01:00:27,167
- Why did you do it?
- Why did I do what?

327
01:00:27,251 --> 01:00:32,501
- Why did you stop him?
- I thought it was you.

328
01:01:12,376 --> 01:01:17,084
What's up? Why did you stop me?

329
01:01:17,167 --> 01:01:21,667
- I didn't stop you.
- Who did it then? You?

330
01:01:25,376 --> 01:01:27,626
Who the hell knows?

331
01:01:29,709 --> 01:01:32,584
Congratulations, Mister Shakespeare.

332
01:01:32,667 --> 01:01:35,709
To go straight ahead is frightening,
to go back is embarrassing.

333
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:41,959
So you gave yourself a command.
Fear has made you come to your senses.

334
01:01:42,042 --> 01:01:43,959
- What?
- Stop it.

335
01:01:44,084 --> 01:01:47,834
- Why have you emptied the bottle?
- Stop it, I said!

336
01:02:03,376 --> 01:02:08,167
The Zone is a very complicated system

337
01:02:10,667 --> 01:02:14,417
of traps, and they're all deadly.

338
01:02:17,376 --> 01:02:20,709
I don't know what goes on here
in the absence of people,

339
01:02:20,792 --> 01:02:26,459
but the moment someone shows up,
everything comes into motion.

340
01:02:29,001 --> 01:02:32,126
Old traps disappear and new ones emerge.

341
01:02:33,459 --> 01:02:36,126
Safe spots become impassable.

342
01:02:37,709 --> 01:02:42,917
Now your path is easy,
now it's impossibly confusing.

343
01:02:47,334 --> 01:02:49,209
That's the Zone.

344
01:02:50,417 --> 01:02:54,084
It may even seem capricious.

345
01:02:55,292 --> 01:02:59,251
But it is what we've made it
with our condition.

346
01:03:02,251 --> 01:03:07,501
It happened that people had to
stop halfway and go back.

347
01:03:09,251 --> 01:03:12,876
Some of them even died
on the very threshold of the room.

348
01:03:13,917 --> 01:03:17,417
But everything that's going on here
depends not on the Zone, but on us!

349
01:03:17,501 --> 01:03:21,376
So it lets the good ones pass
and kills the bad ones?

350
01:03:22,459 --> 01:03:24,251
I don't know.

351
01:03:24,334 --> 01:03:27,542
I think it lets those pass who

352
01:03:27,626 --> 01:03:30,167
have lost all hope.

353
01:03:30,251 --> 01:03:34,834
Not good or bad but wretched people.

354
01:03:35,751 --> 01:03:40,042
But even the most wretched will die
if they don't know how to behave.

355
01:03:49,834 --> 01:03:53,626
You have been lucky, it just warned you.

356
01:03:57,959 --> 01:04:00,667
I suppose I'll wait for you here

357
01:04:01,792 --> 01:04:06,626
until you come back happy.

358
01:04:07,626 --> 01:04:09,376
It's impossible!

359
01:04:09,459 --> 01:04:12,542
I've got sandwiches, a flask...

360
01:04:12,626 --> 01:04:15,542
You won't last even an hour here without me.

361
01:04:15,626 --> 01:04:18,917
Besides, here you don't go back
the way you came.

362
01:04:21,084 --> 01:04:23,084
Anyway, I'd prefer...

363
01:04:23,167 --> 01:04:26,334
Then we're going back right away.

364
01:04:26,417 --> 01:04:31,001
I'll return your money minus a certain sum

365
01:04:31,084 --> 01:04:33,626
for the trouble, so to speak.

366
01:04:33,709 --> 01:04:36,126
Have you come to your senses, Professor?

367
01:04:41,042 --> 01:04:44,417
All right. Go on, throw your nut.

368
01:05:36,209 --> 01:05:39,917
Part Two

369
01:05:42,042 --> 01:05:48,126
STALKER

370
01:05:51,042 --> 01:05:54,292
Where are you? Come here!

371
01:05:59,334 --> 01:06:01,417
Are you tired?

372
01:06:16,709 --> 01:06:18,709
Oh, God!

373
01:06:21,917 --> 01:06:26,834
Judging by his tone,
he's going to start sermonising again.

374
01:06:46,084 --> 01:06:48,959
<i>Let everything
that's been planned come true.</i>

375
01:06:50,251 --> 01:06:52,292
<i>Let them believe.</i>

376
01:06:54,209 --> 01:06:57,084
<i>And let them laugh at their passions.</i>

377
01:06:57,751 --> 01:07:02,292
<i>Because what they call passion
actually is not some emotional energy,</i>

378
01:07:02,376 --> 01:07:06,167
<i>but just the friction between
their souls and the outside world.</i>

379
01:07:07,084 --> 01:07:10,376
<i>And most important,
let them believe in themselves.</i>

380
01:07:11,292 --> 01:07:14,917
<i>Let them be helpless like children,</i>

381
01:07:15,001 --> 01:07:19,126
<i>because weakness is a great thing,
and strength is nothing.</i>

382
01:07:23,876 --> 01:07:27,626
<i>When a man is just born,
he is weak and fragile.</i>

383
01:07:27,709 --> 01:07:30,792
<i>When he dies, he is hard and insensitive.</i>

384
01:07:32,126 --> 01:07:35,501
<i>When a tree is growing,
it's tender and fragile,</i>

385
01:07:35,584 --> 01:07:40,001
<i>but when it's dry and hard, it dies.</i>

386
01:07:41,084 --> 01:07:45,501
<i>Hardness and strength
are death's companions.</i>

387
01:07:46,834 --> 01:07:50,834
<i>Pliancy and weakness are expressions
of the freshness of being.</i>

388
01:07:52,292 --> 01:07:56,417
<i>Because what has hardened will never win.</i>

389
01:08:16,751 --> 01:08:22,084
Come here! We're progressing well.

390
01:08:22,167 --> 01:08:24,667
Soon we'll come to a dry tunnel,
after that, it will get easier.

391
01:08:24,751 --> 01:08:27,001
Knock on wood.

392
01:08:27,084 --> 01:08:31,751
- Are we on our way already?
- Of course. Why?

393
01:08:31,834 --> 01:08:37,126
I thought you just wanted
to show us something.

394
01:08:37,209 --> 01:08:40,376
- What about my knapsack?
- What about it?

395
01:08:40,459 --> 01:08:44,376
I left it there. I didn't know we were going.

396
01:08:45,292 --> 01:08:49,792
- There's nothing we can do about it.
- No, we have to go back.

397
01:08:49,876 --> 01:08:52,334
- It's impossible!
- I can't do without my knapsack!

398
01:08:52,417 --> 01:08:57,084
Can't you understand that no one here
has ever come back the same way?

399
01:08:58,709 --> 01:09:02,334
Forget about your knapsack.
What have you got in there, diamonds?

400
01:09:02,417 --> 01:09:05,751
Don't you remember where you're going?
The room will give you anything you want.

401
01:09:05,834 --> 01:09:10,084
Really. it will drown you in knapsacks.

402
01:09:10,167 --> 01:09:12,751
How far is it, this room?

403
01:09:12,834 --> 01:09:17,917
If you go straight, about 200 metres,
but there's no going straight here.

404
01:09:18,001 --> 01:09:19,417
Let's go.

405
01:09:20,751 --> 01:09:26,542
Give up your empiricism, Professor.
Miracles are beyond empiricism.

406
01:09:28,334 --> 01:09:31,334
Remember how St Peter
was nearly drowned?

407
01:09:36,084 --> 01:09:37,751
Go, Writer.

408
01:09:39,751 --> 01:09:41,792
Go where?

409
01:09:41,876 --> 01:09:43,417
Up these stairs.

410
01:09:54,084 --> 01:09:56,584
Professor, where are you?

411
01:11:47,542 --> 01:11:49,626
Here's the dry tunnel!

412
01:11:49,709 --> 01:11:51,834
You call this dry?

413
01:11:53,376 --> 01:11:58,584
It's a local joke.
Normally you have to swim here.

414
01:12:27,292 --> 01:12:29,501
Wait, where's the Professor?

415
01:12:29,584 --> 01:12:32,959
- What?
- The Professor has disappeared!

416
01:12:34,959 --> 01:12:38,251
How could this happen?
He was following you all the way.

417
01:12:38,334 --> 01:12:41,542
He probably lagged behind and lost his way.

418
01:12:41,626 --> 01:12:46,001
No, he didn't lose his way!
He must've gone for the knapsack!

419
01:12:46,084 --> 01:12:48,209
He won't be able to make it now.

420
01:12:49,292 --> 01:12:50,501
Shall we wait for him?

421
01:12:50,584 --> 01:12:55,959
We can't. Things change here
every minute. We'll have to go.

422
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:28,251
Look! What is it? How could it be?

423
01:13:28,334 --> 01:13:31,876
- I already explained.
- What did you explain?

424
01:13:31,959 --> 01:13:37,584
It's the Zone, don't you understand?
Let's go, quick. It's...

425
01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:00,376
There he is!

426
01:14:13,209 --> 01:14:17,167
I'm certainly grateful to you that you...

427
01:14:17,251 --> 01:14:19,167
How did you get here?

428
01:14:21,292 --> 01:14:27,167
Mostly I had to crawl up here on all fours.

429
01:14:28,501 --> 01:14:31,334
Incredible.
How did you manage to overtake us?

430
01:14:32,667 --> 01:14:39,126
What do you mean, "overtake"?
I came back here for the knapsack.

431
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:43,459
And how has our nut got here?

432
01:14:45,584 --> 01:14:50,542
My God, that's the trap!

433
01:14:54,376 --> 01:14:58,542
Porcupine put this nut here on purpose.

434
01:15:01,834 --> 01:15:06,501
How could the Zone let us through?

435
01:15:12,334 --> 01:15:17,334
Oh, God, I'm not going
to take one more step until...

436
01:15:18,584 --> 01:15:20,626
I don't like it.

437
01:15:25,626 --> 01:15:29,834
That's it. We rest.

438
01:15:42,376 --> 01:15:46,917
But stay away from this nut, just in case.

439
01:15:47,834 --> 01:15:51,959
Sorry, but I thought that the Professor
wouldn't be able to make it.

440
01:15:52,667 --> 01:15:53,751
You see, I...

441
01:15:55,459 --> 01:15:59,709
I never know beforehand what
kind of people I'm taking with me.

442
01:15:59,792 --> 01:16:04,126
Everything becomes clear once it's too late.

443
01:16:05,251 --> 01:16:10,709
What's important is that the Professor's
bag with his underwear is safe.

444
01:16:11,834 --> 01:16:16,959
Don't stick your nose in someone's
underwear if you don't understand it.

445
01:16:17,042 --> 01:16:22,626
What is there to understand?
Binomial theorem?

446
01:16:23,709 --> 01:16:26,709
Some psychological abysses!

447
01:16:26,792 --> 01:16:29,376
You have a bad reputation at your institute.

448
01:16:29,459 --> 01:16:32,251
They don't give you money for expeditions.

449
01:16:33,126 --> 01:16:37,501
So you decide to pack a knapsack
full of manometers and other shit,

450
01:16:39,292 --> 01:16:41,376
penetrate the Zone illegally,

451
01:16:43,042 --> 01:16:45,667
and put all these miracles to an algebra test.

452
01:16:48,292 --> 01:16:51,751
No one in the world
has ever heard of the Zone.

453
01:16:51,834 --> 01:16:53,959
So we'll create a sure sensation.

454
01:16:55,209 --> 01:17:00,626
The television, fans raving
and bringing laurel wreaths.

455
01:17:01,667 --> 01:17:06,751
Here our Professor appears, all in white,

456
01:17:06,834 --> 01:17:11,042
and declares, "Mene-mene, tekel, upharsin."

457
01:17:12,334 --> 01:17:14,876
Everyone gaping

458
01:17:15,042 --> 01:17:19,334
and shouting, "He deserves a Nobel Prize!"

459
01:17:22,251 --> 01:17:27,667
You lousy scribbler,
a homespun psychoanalyst.

460
01:17:28,709 --> 01:17:34,417
You're only good for painting walls
in public toilets, you and your big mouth.

461
01:17:35,667 --> 01:17:39,417
No good. Too sluggish.

462
01:17:41,167 --> 01:17:44,167
You don't know how to do it.

463
01:17:44,251 --> 01:17:47,126
All right. I'm going to get a Nobel Prize.

464
01:17:48,126 --> 01:17:52,542
And what are you after?
Want to bless mankind

465
01:17:52,709 --> 01:17:56,251
with the pearls
of your purchased inspiration?

466
01:17:57,709 --> 01:18:01,709
I don't care a damn about mankind.
Of all your mankind

467
01:18:01,792 --> 01:18:06,667
I'm interested only in one man. Myself.

468
01:18:07,501 --> 01:18:12,334
Whether I'm worth anything
or I'm just shit like others.

469
01:18:13,417 --> 01:18:17,042
And if you find out that you're really...

470
01:18:17,126 --> 01:18:22,626
You know, Mr Einstein,
I have no wish to argue with you.

471
01:18:25,334 --> 01:18:29,292
Truth is born of argument, damn it!

472
01:18:32,501 --> 01:18:35,501
Listen, Chingachgook.

473
01:18:38,709 --> 01:18:42,542
You've brought many people here.

474
01:18:44,667 --> 01:18:47,251
Not as many as I would like.

475
01:18:47,334 --> 01:18:53,584
That's not the point. Why did they
come here? What did they want?

476
01:18:53,667 --> 01:18:55,376
Happiness, I guess.

477
01:18:55,459 --> 01:18:59,417
Yes, but what kind of happiness?

478
01:19:02,292 --> 01:19:05,626
People don't like to talk about
their innermost feelings.

479
01:19:06,709 --> 01:19:09,334
And it's neither your business nor mine.

480
01:19:10,626 --> 01:19:13,417
In any case, you've been lucky.

481
01:19:13,501 --> 01:19:17,834
As for me, I haven't seen
one happy man in my life.

482
01:19:17,917 --> 01:19:20,292
Me neither.

483
01:19:20,376 --> 01:19:23,709
They return from the room
and I lead them back,

484
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:26,501
and we never see each other again.

485
01:19:28,417 --> 01:19:31,626
It's not as if wishes come true immediately.

486
01:19:32,459 --> 01:19:38,709
Have you ever wished
to use this room yourself?

487
01:19:43,501 --> 01:19:45,834
I'm fine as I am.

488
01:20:37,959 --> 01:20:40,626
Listen, Professor.

489
01:20:42,834 --> 01:20:46,001
Speaking of purchased inspiration,

490
01:20:48,417 --> 01:20:51,167
let's imagine that I enter this room

491
01:20:51,251 --> 01:20:55,792
and return
to our God-forsaken town a genius.

492
01:21:02,626 --> 01:21:07,042
A man writes because he's tormented,
because he doubts.

493
01:21:09,501 --> 01:21:13,417
He needs to constantly prove
to himself and others

494
01:21:13,501 --> 01:21:15,751
that he's worth something.

495
01:21:18,167 --> 01:21:21,501
And if I know for sure that I'm a genius,

496
01:21:23,709 --> 01:21:26,084
why write then?

497
01:21:28,209 --> 01:21:30,459
What the hell for?

498
01:21:33,084 --> 01:21:36,126
Well, I must say,

499
01:21:36,209 --> 01:21:38,709
that we exist for...

500
01:21:38,792 --> 01:21:42,542
Will you be so kind as to leave me alone?

501
01:21:44,167 --> 01:21:48,584
Let me get a wink, I haven't slept all night.

502
01:21:49,542 --> 01:21:52,626
Keep your complexes to yourself.

503
01:21:52,709 --> 01:21:57,959
In any case, all this technology of yours,

504
01:22:01,251 --> 01:22:03,751
all those blast furnaces, wheels,

505
01:22:05,876 --> 01:22:09,917
and other bullshit

506
01:22:10,001 --> 01:22:14,292
are only designed in order
to work less and eat more.

507
01:22:15,334 --> 01:22:18,709
They are all just crutches, artificial limbs.

508
01:22:21,292 --> 01:22:24,834
And mankind exists in order to create

509
01:22:27,667 --> 01:22:30,084
works of art.

510
01:22:31,667 --> 01:22:36,917
Unlike all other human activities,
this one is unselfish.

511
01:22:39,292 --> 01:22:44,334
Great illusions! Images of the absolute truth!

512
01:22:46,417 --> 01:22:49,209
Are you listening to me, Professor?

513
01:22:50,709 --> 01:22:53,751
What unselfishness are you talking about?

514
01:22:53,834 --> 01:22:58,084
People still die of hunger.
Have you just landed from the moon?

515
01:23:07,292 --> 01:23:12,501
And they are considered to be
our smart aristocracy!

516
01:23:12,584 --> 01:23:16,042
You're not even capable of thinking
in abstractions.

517
01:23:17,459 --> 01:23:23,292
Are you going to teach me
about the meaning of life?

518
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:29,459
And also how to think?

519
01:23:29,542 --> 01:23:31,417
It's useless.

520
01:23:33,167 --> 01:23:36,709
You might be a professor,
but you're an ignorant one.

521
01:24:25,667 --> 01:24:30,417
<i>"And there was a great earthquake.</i>

"were going to a village

"named...

542
01:29:04,167 --> 01:29:08,042
"and they talked with each other
about all these things.

"And while they were conversing

"He Himself approached

"But their eyes were prevented
from recognizing Him.

"And He said to them, 'What are these words

547

"'you are exchanging with one another,
and why are you sad?'

548
01:29:30,792 --> 01:29:32,876
"And one of them, named..."

549
01:29:46,751 --> 01:29:48,542
Are you awake?

550
01:29:54,417 --> 01:29:56,667
You were speaking of the meaning

551
01:29:58,042 --> 01:30:00,709
of our life,

552
01:30:01,667 --> 01:30:04,084
of the unselfishness of art.

553
01:30:07,667 --> 01:30:09,584
Take music, for instance.

554
01:30:15,751 --> 01:30:19,376
It is connected to reality
less than anything else,

555
01:30:19,459 --> 01:30:23,501
or if connected at all, it's done mechanically,
not by way of ideas,

556
01:30:23,584 --> 01:30:27,792
just by a sheer sound,
devoid of any associations.

557
01:30:32,584 --> 01:30:38,042
And yet, music, as if by some miracle,
gets through to our heart.

558
01:30:41,751 --> 01:30:45,626
What is it that resonates in us
in response to noise brought to harmony,

559
01:30:46,542 --> 01:30:50,792
making it the source of the greatest delight

560
01:30:50,876 --> 01:30:53,501
which stuns us and brings us together?

561
01:30:55,501 --> 01:31:00,292
What's all this needed for?
And most importantly, who needs it?

562
01:31:03,084 --> 01:31:06,792
You would say, "No one. And for no reason."

563
01:31:06,876 --> 01:31:08,501
Unselfishly.

564
01:31:10,001 --> 01:31:11,417
No.

565
01:31:13,084 --> 01:31:15,209
I don't think so.

566
01:31:16,792 --> 01:31:19,917
After all, everything has some sense.

567
01:31:21,834 --> 01:31:25,834
Sense and reason.

568
01:31:54,542 --> 01:31:58,501
Do we have to go there?

569
01:32:00,667 --> 01:32:05,251
Unfortunately, yes. There's no other way.

570
01:32:20,042 --> 01:32:24,626
It looks morbid, don't you think, Professor?

571
01:32:28,417 --> 01:32:31,376
I don't feel like going first.

572
01:32:32,459 --> 01:32:35,334
And Chingachgooks can never be volunteers.

573
01:32:37,001 --> 01:32:41,501
I think we'll have to draw lots. Do you mind?

574
01:32:42,376 --> 01:32:45,501
For this, I'd rather have a volunteer.

575
01:32:48,292 --> 01:32:50,501
Have you got matches?

576
01:32:58,209 --> 01:32:59,626
Thanks.

577
01:33:11,834 --> 01:33:14,126
The long one will go.

578
01:33:16,876 --> 01:33:18,376
Take one.

579
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:29,042
The long one. No luck this time.

580
01:33:44,167 --> 01:33:47,251
Why don't you throw
one of your nuts at least?

581
01:33:47,334 --> 01:33:49,542
Sure. As you wish.

582
01:34:26,876 --> 01:34:28,459
One more?

583
01:34:37,209 --> 01:34:41,584
All right. I'll go.

584
01:36:28,417 --> 01:36:30,292
Hurry up, Professor!

585
01:40:40,084 --> 01:40:41,209
There's...

586
01:40:44,876 --> 01:40:47,167
There's a door here!

587
01:41:04,542 --> 01:41:09,459
Go that way! Open the door and go in!

588
01:41:17,667 --> 01:41:21,542
Me? Do I have to go in first again?

589
01:41:21,626 --> 01:41:27,376
You've drawn the lot.
Go! People don't wait here.

590
01:41:31,917 --> 01:41:36,042
What have you got there? No guns here!

591
01:41:36,917 --> 01:41:39,626
You'll get yourself killed, and us too!

592
01:41:39,709 --> 01:41:41,667
Don't you remember the tanks?

593
01:41:42,501 --> 01:41:44,209
Drop it, I beg you.

594
01:41:44,292 --> 01:41:46,376
Don't you understand?

595
01:41:47,959 --> 01:41:52,042
If something happens,
I can save you, but not this way.

596
01:41:53,626 --> 01:41:56,542
I beg you!

597
01:41:58,167 --> 01:42:00,834
Who are you going to fire at?

598
01:42:13,792 --> 01:42:16,334
Go, we haven't got much time!

599
01:42:20,251 --> 01:42:22,917
There's water here.

600
01:42:23,001 --> 01:42:26,167
Hold on to the handrail and go down.

601
01:43:12,167 --> 01:43:16,417
But don't go anywhere! Wait for us outside!

602
01:43:30,792 --> 01:43:33,167
I hope you haven't got anything like that?

603
01:43:33,917 --> 01:43:37,042
- Like what?
- Like a gun.

604
01:43:37,126 --> 01:43:40,834
No. As a last resort, I've got an ampoule.

605
01:43:40,917 --> 01:43:45,334
- What ampoule?
- Implanted ampoule. Poison!

606
01:43:45,417 --> 01:43:49,209
Oh, God. Did you come here to die?

607
01:43:54,917 --> 01:43:57,501
No, it's just in case.

608
01:44:25,084 --> 01:44:27,126
Writer! Come back!

609
01:44:27,209 --> 01:44:29,626
Come back!
Do you want to get yourself killed?

610
01:44:29,709 --> 01:44:34,459
I told you to wait by the exit!
Stop! Don't move!

611
01:45:20,917 --> 01:45:22,459
That's all your pipe.

612
01:45:22,542 --> 01:45:26,626
- Why?
- You should've gone in there first.

613
01:45:27,959 --> 01:45:31,334
He was so scared
that he went the wrong way.

614
01:47:17,209 --> 01:47:20,584
One more experiment.

615
01:47:22,584 --> 01:47:28,209
Experiments, facts,
truth of the highest order.

616
01:47:29,792 --> 01:47:33,542
There's no such thing as facts.
Especially here.

617
01:47:34,792 --> 01:47:39,459
All this is someone's idiotic invention.

618
01:47:39,542 --> 01:47:41,917
Don't you feel it?

619
01:47:44,251 --> 01:47:47,292
But you, of course, must find out
whose invention it is.

620
01:47:49,709 --> 01:47:51,626
And Why?

621
01:47:52,667 --> 01:47:55,126
What good can your knowledge do?

622
01:47:55,209 --> 01:47:59,334
Who's going to get a guilty conscience
because of it? Me?

623
01:48:00,584 --> 01:48:04,876
I've got no conscience. I've just got nerves.

624
01:48:04,959 --> 01:48:07,751
Some bastard would criticize me,
I'd get wounded.

625
01:48:08,709 --> 01:48:12,251
Another would laud me,
I'd get wounded again.

626
01:48:12,334 --> 01:48:17,126
I would put my heart and soul into it,
they'd gobble up both my heart and soul.

627
01:48:19,501 --> 01:48:22,792
I would relieve my soul of filth,
they'd gobble it up too.

628
01:48:23,709 --> 01:48:26,376
They're all so literate.

629
01:48:28,126 --> 01:48:31,042
They've all got sensory deficiency.

630
01:48:32,084 --> 01:48:34,584
And they're all swarming around,

631
01:48:35,417 --> 01:48:42,501
journalists, editors, critics,
some endless women.

632
01:48:42,584 --> 01:48:45,751
And they all demand, "More, more!"

633
01:48:49,042 --> 01:48:54,459
One hell of a writer am I, if I hate writing.

634
01:48:56,792 --> 01:49:00,792
If it's constant torment for me,
a painful, shameful occupation,

635
01:49:00,876 --> 01:49:03,542
like squeezing out haemorrhoids.

636
01:49:06,834 --> 01:49:10,834
I used to think that someone would
get better because of my books.

637
01:49:10,917 --> 01:49:13,417
No, nobody needs me!

638
01:49:13,501 --> 01:49:18,292
Two days after I die, they'll start
gobbling up someone else.

639
01:49:21,542 --> 01:49:25,917
I wanted to change them,
but it's they who have changed me.

640
01:49:26,001 --> 01:49:28,792
Making me in their own image.

641
01:49:33,626 --> 01:49:38,417
The future used to be just
a continuation of the present,

642
01:49:38,501 --> 01:49:43,042
with all the changes looming
far beyond the horizon.

643
01:49:43,126 --> 01:49:46,167
Now the future and the present are one.

644
01:49:53,709 --> 01:49:56,751
Are they ready for it?

645
01:49:56,834 --> 01:50:01,334
They don't want to know anything!
All they know is how to gobble!

646
01:50:15,459 --> 01:50:18,084
Gosh, how lucky you are!

647
01:50:18,167 --> 01:50:23,376
My goodness, now,
you're going to live a hundred years!

648
01:50:37,042 --> 01:50:41,542
Yes. But why not forever?

649
01:50:44,251 --> 01:50:46,209
Like the eternal Jew.

650
01:51:26,584 --> 01:51:30,334
You are probably a fine man.

651
01:51:30,417 --> 01:51:32,876
I didn't have any doubts.

652
01:51:32,959 --> 01:51:37,167
I can imagine what torture it was
for you being in there.

653
01:51:38,292 --> 01:51:41,626
This pipe is a horrible place!
The most horrible in the Zone!

654
01:51:41,709 --> 01:51:45,167
It's called "the meat mincer,"
but it's much worse than any mincer.

655
01:51:45,251 --> 01:51:48,376
So many people have perished there!

656
01:51:52,167 --> 01:51:55,917
Porcupine sent his brother to die there.

657
01:51:59,001 --> 01:52:01,709
The boy was so delicate, very talented.

658
01:52:03,626 --> 01:52:05,751
Here, listen to this.

659
01:52:07,084 --> 01:52:11,501
"So summer is gone
Leaving no epitaph

660
01:52:12,334 --> 01:52:17,251
"it's still warm in the sun
Only that's not enough

661
01:52:17,334 --> 01:52:20,084
"All that true could have come

662
01:52:20,167 --> 01:52:24,459
"Like a five-fingered fluff
Folded into my palm

663
01:52:25,667 --> 01:52:28,001
"Only that's not enough

664
01:52:28,792 --> 01:52:33,959
"No evil was slighted in the good aftermath

665
01:52:34,042 --> 01:52:39,334
"The world was festively lighted
Only that's not enough

666
01:52:39,417 --> 01:52:44,751
"Life forever was tucking
Caring, making me laugh

667
01:52:44,834 --> 01:52:50,084
"I was really lucky
Only that's not enough

668
01:52:50,167 --> 01:52:54,626
"No leaves ever seared
No limbs broken rough

669
01:52:55,667 --> 01:53:01,042
"Day, like glass, washed all clear
Only that's not enough"

670
01:53:02,876 --> 01:53:05,542
Good, aren't they? That's his verses.

671
01:53:05,626 --> 01:53:09,834
Why do you fidget? Fussing all the time?

672
01:53:09,917 --> 01:53:12,042
- I'm just...
- I get sick just looking at you!

673
01:53:12,126 --> 01:53:17,084
I'm so happy! It's not often that
everyone who goes makes it.

674
01:53:17,167 --> 01:53:21,334
You did everything right.
You're good, kind, honest people.

675
01:53:21,417 --> 01:53:23,167
I'm proud that I was right about you.

676
01:53:23,251 --> 01:53:27,167
Look at him! He's happy
that everything ended well!

677
01:53:27,251 --> 01:53:31,709
Fate! Zone! I'm a fine man, he says!

678
01:53:31,792 --> 01:53:34,584
You think I didn't see how you
shoved the two long matches at me?

679
01:53:34,667 --> 01:53:37,417
- No, you don't understand...
- Of course, how could I?

680
01:53:37,501 --> 01:53:41,417
I'm sorry, Professor, no of fence meant,

681
01:53:41,501 --> 01:53:43,792
but this fool has chosen you
to be his favourite.

682
01:53:43,876 --> 01:53:45,251
Come on, it's unfair!

683
01:53:45,334 --> 01:53:50,167
And me, a second-rate creature,
he shoves into that pipe!

684
01:53:50,251 --> 01:53:52,459
Meat mincer! To think of such a word!

685
01:53:53,584 --> 01:53:58,584
What right have you got to decide who lives
and who goes into the meat mincer?

686
01:53:58,667 --> 01:54:00,709
You've chosen it yourself!

687
01:54:00,792 --> 01:54:05,626
What? One long match out of two long ones?

688
01:54:05,709 --> 01:54:07,834
The matches are nothing.

689
01:54:07,917 --> 01:54:10,876
The Zone had let you through earlier,
under the nut,

690
01:54:10,959 --> 01:54:15,626
so it became clear that only you
could go through the meat mincer.

691
01:54:15,709 --> 01:54:18,917
- And we just followed you.
- Well, it's too much...

692
01:54:19,001 --> 01:54:23,834
You can't even imagine how dangerous
it is to make a mistake here.

693
01:54:24,917 --> 01:54:27,334
But someone had to be first!

694
01:54:27,417 --> 01:54:30,917
Yes? No, it's not a clinic!

695
01:54:32,667 --> 01:54:36,292
You see, someone has to go first!

696
01:54:43,334 --> 01:54:44,667
Don't touch it!

697
01:55:05,626 --> 01:55:08,626
- <i>Yes?</i>
- Laboratory nine, please.

698
01:55:10,001 --> 01:55:11,459
<i>Just a minute.</i>

699
01:55:17,876 --> 01:55:21,042
- <i>Hello?</i>
- I hope I'm not disturbing you.

700
01:55:21,126 --> 01:55:25,584
<i>- What</i> do you <i>want?</i>
- Just a few words with you.

701
01:55:25,667 --> 01:55:28,209
You've hidden it. I've found it.

702
01:55:28,292 --> 01:55:34,001
The old building. Bunker four.
Do you hear me?

703
01:55:34,084 --> 01:55:36,501
<i>I'm alerting security immediately.</i>

704
01:55:37,334 --> 01:55:42,292
You may do it. You may inform on me,

705
01:55:42,376 --> 01:55:46,751
you may set my colleagues against me,
but it's too late.

706
01:55:46,834 --> 01:55:53,084
I'm now a stone's throw from that place.

707
01:55:53,167 --> 01:55:55,917
<i>Do you realise that's the end of you
as a scientist?</i>

708
01:55:56,001 --> 01:55:57,251
Well, you may rejoice!

709
01:55:57,334 --> 01:56:00,834
<i>So you realise what will happen if you dare?</i>

710
01:56:02,792 --> 01:56:04,626
Trying to scare me again?

711
01:56:06,417 --> 01:56:11,792
All my life I've been afraid of something.
Even of you.

712
01:56:12,626 --> 01:56:16,167
But now I'm not afraid of anything,
I assure you.

713
01:56:16,251 --> 01:56:19,667
<i>Oh, God, you are not even a Herostratus.</i>

714
01:56:19,751 --> 01:56:22,709
<i>It's just that you've always wanted
to make my life unbearable</i>

715
01:56:22,792 --> 01:56:25,792
<i>because 20 years ago I slept with your wife.</i>

716
01:56:26,751 --> 01:56:31,042
<i>And now you're delighted
that you've got even with me.</i>

717
01:56:31,126 --> 01:56:36,501
<i>Well, go and do your vile thing.</i>

718
01:56:36,584 --> 01:56:38,709
<i>Don't you dare hang up on me!</i>

719
01:56:40,042 --> 01:56:43,417
<i>Prison is not the worst thing awaiting you.</i>

720
01:56:43,501 --> 01:56:46,542
<i>The worst is that you'll never be able
to forgive yourself for this.</i>

721
01:56:46,626 --> 01:56:51,417
<i>I already see you hanging from your braces
in your prison cell.</i>

722
01:56:54,251 --> 01:56:58,167
What are you up to, Professor?

723
01:56:59,292 --> 01:57:04,209
Do you realise what will happen
when everybody believes in the room?

724
01:57:05,626 --> 01:57:08,834
And all come rushing here?

725
01:57:09,584 --> 01:57:13,584
It's only a matter of time.

726
01:57:13,667 --> 01:57:17,209
If not today, then tomorrow!
And not just tens of them, thousands!

727
01:57:17,292 --> 01:57:22,459
Unfulfilled emperors,
great inquisitors, fuhrers,

728
01:57:22,542 --> 01:57:26,667
self-appointed benefactors
of the human race!

729
01:57:26,751 --> 01:57:31,292
And they'll come not for money
or inspiration, but to change the world!

730
01:57:31,376 --> 01:57:33,334
I never bring people like that here.
You think I don't understand that?

731
01:57:33,417 --> 01:57:36,292
What on earth can you understand?

732
01:57:37,167 --> 01:57:39,917
You're not the only stalker on Earth.

733
01:57:40,001 --> 01:57:41,876
No stalker can know

734
01:57:41,959 --> 01:57:46,459
what those you lead bring with them
and what they take from here.

735
01:57:46,542 --> 01:57:49,501
And the number of unmotivated crimes
is on the rise!

736
01:57:49,584 --> 01:57:51,459
Isn't that your doing?

737
01:57:51,542 --> 01:57:56,459
Take coups d'état by the military,
or the mafia penetrating governments,

738
01:57:56,542 --> 01:57:58,834
aren't they all your clients?

739
01:57:58,917 --> 01:58:03,126
Or lasers and all those super-bacteria,

740
01:58:03,209 --> 01:58:07,626
all that filth, kept for the time being in safes?

741
01:58:07,709 --> 01:58:10,834
Will you please stop this
sociological diarrhoea?

742
01:58:10,917 --> 01:58:13,042
Can you really believe in all those fairy tales?

743
01:58:13,126 --> 01:58:18,001
Not in the good ones, no!
But in the bad ones, certainly!

744
01:58:18,084 --> 01:58:20,126
Come on!

745
01:58:20,209 --> 01:58:25,084
A human being is not capable
of such hatred or love

746
01:58:26,334 --> 01:58:29,459
that would extend over
the whole of mankind.

747
01:58:30,292 --> 01:58:33,917
Well, money, a woman,
maybe a desire for revenge.

748
01:58:34,001 --> 01:58:38,292
Let my boss be run over by a car,
that I can understand.

749
01:58:38,376 --> 01:58:41,459
But ruling over the world! A just society!

750
01:58:41,542 --> 01:58:43,834
God's kingdom on earth!

751
01:58:43,917 --> 01:58:49,042
These are not just wishes,
this is ideology, action, concepts.

752
01:58:50,334 --> 01:58:54,376
Unconscious compassion
is not ready for realization yet,

753
01:58:55,501 --> 01:58:58,459
as a regular instinctive impulse.

754
01:58:59,251 --> 01:59:03,251
There cannot be happiness
at someone else's expense.

755
01:59:04,334 --> 01:59:06,792
I can see quite clearly now

756
01:59:06,876 --> 01:59:11,084
that you plan to overwhelm
mankind with good deeds.

757
01:59:12,501 --> 01:59:16,667
As for me, I'm not a bit worried
about you or myself,

758
01:59:16,751 --> 01:59:19,376
and least of all about mankind.

759
01:59:20,584 --> 01:59:23,042
Because you're not going
to achieve anything.

760
01:59:24,126 --> 01:59:27,751
At best, you'll get your Nobel Prize.

761
01:59:29,376 --> 01:59:34,626
Or rather you'll get something
absolutely incongruous,

762
01:59:34,709 --> 01:59:38,792
something you don't even think about.
Something like this telephone.

763
01:59:40,917 --> 01:59:45,084
You dream of one thing,
but you get quite another.

764
01:59:47,209 --> 01:59:49,084
Why did you do that?

765
02:00:03,209 --> 02:00:07,084
Telephone. Electricity.

766
02:00:10,751 --> 02:00:14,292
Look, very good sleeping pills.

767
02:00:14,376 --> 02:00:18,209
They don't make ones like that any longer.
Why so many of them here?

768
02:00:22,334 --> 02:00:24,417
Maybe we'd better be going?

769
02:00:25,251 --> 02:00:29,834
It'll be dark soon, difficult to get back.

770
02:00:36,834 --> 02:00:40,709
By the way, it's absolutely clear to me

771
02:00:40,792 --> 02:00:44,251
that all this poem reciting
and making detours

772
02:00:44,334 --> 02:00:48,042
is just a form of apologizing.

773
02:00:48,126 --> 02:00:49,959
I can understand you.

774
02:00:51,792 --> 02:00:54,292
Difficult childhood, bad environment.

775
02:00:55,501 --> 02:01:02,042
But don't have any illusions,
I'm not going to forgive you.

776
02:01:02,876 --> 02:01:06,001
Will you please stop it? Do me a favour.

777
02:01:57,959 --> 02:02:01,417
Professor, come here, please.

778
02:02:34,834 --> 02:02:38,417
Wait a minute. Don't be in a hurry.

779
02:02:38,501 --> 02:02:40,667
I'm in no hurry whatsoever.

780
02:03:31,417 --> 02:03:33,792
I know you're going to get mad.

781
02:03:36,667 --> 02:03:38,709
Anyway, I must tell you.

782
02:03:45,709 --> 02:03:50,834
We are now on the threshold.

783
02:03:58,334 --> 02:04:03,542
This is the most
important moment of your life.

784
02:04:06,626 --> 02:04:08,876
You must know that

785
02:04:10,084 --> 02:04:15,251
your innermost wishes
will be made real here.

786
02:04:16,917 --> 02:04:22,501
Your most sincere wish! Born of suffering!

787
02:04:51,709 --> 02:04:54,001
No need to say anything.

788
02:04:57,167 --> 02:04:58,709
You just have to

789
02:05:00,792 --> 02:05:06,001
concentrate and try to recall your whole life.

790
02:05:09,126 --> 02:05:14,126
When a man thinks of the past,
he becomes kinder.

791
02:05:15,501 --> 02:05:17,292
And most important...

792
02:05:50,876 --> 02:05:52,501
Most important...

793
02:05:57,167 --> 02:05:59,167
You have to believe!

794
02:06:08,167 --> 02:06:10,084
Now you can go.

795
02:06:15,751 --> 02:06:17,626
Who wants to be the first?

796
02:06:22,542 --> 02:06:24,251
<i>NEWS you'?</i>

797
02:06:25,834 --> 02:06:29,126
Me? No, I don't want to.

798
02:06:29,917 --> 02:06:34,542
I understand, it's not easy, but it will pass.

799
02:06:36,292 --> 02:06:37,542
I doubt

800
02:06:39,292 --> 02:06:41,126
that it will pass.

801
02:06:42,876 --> 02:06:46,167
If I begin recalling my life,

802
02:06:48,042 --> 02:06:50,251
it's very unlikely I'll get any kinder.

803
02:06:51,751 --> 02:06:56,501
Besides, don't you feel
how shameful the whole thing is?

804
02:07:14,417 --> 02:07:19,459
Humiliating yourself, snivelling, praying?

805
02:07:20,501 --> 02:07:22,876
What's so bad about praying?

806
02:07:24,876 --> 02:07:27,126
It's just your pride speaking.

807
02:07:28,709 --> 02:07:33,959
Calm down, you're not ready yet.
It happens quite often.

808
02:07:36,709 --> 02:07:38,584
Maybe you first?

809
02:07:46,709 --> 02:07:48,209
Yes, me.

810
02:07:58,709 --> 02:08:03,876
We see before us
the Professor's new invention!

811
02:08:04,876 --> 02:08:09,417
An appliance exploring human souls!
A soul metre!

812
02:08:09,501 --> 02:08:12,167
It's only a bomb.

813
02:08:12,251 --> 02:08:13,667
What?

814
02:08:15,626 --> 02:08:17,459
You must be kidding.

815
02:08:17,542 --> 02:08:22,959
No, it's just a bomb. 20 kilotons.

816
02:08:24,209 --> 02:08:25,709
What for?

817
02:08:36,251 --> 02:08:40,209
I assembled it with my friends.

818
02:08:41,917 --> 02:08:46,376
With my former colleagues.

819
02:08:49,959 --> 02:08:54,084
This place will never bring
any happiness to anyone.

820
02:08:58,001 --> 02:09:02,792
But if this thing gets into the wrong hands...

821
02:09:05,084 --> 02:09:07,126
Though, I'm not sure any more.

822
02:09:09,376 --> 02:09:11,501
We came to the conclusion then

823
02:09:13,792 --> 02:09:16,876
that we shouldn't destroy the Zone after all.

824
02:09:18,167 --> 02:09:24,501
Even if it's some miracle,
it's still part of nature,

825
02:09:24,584 --> 02:09:27,167
and therefore, a hope in a sense.

826
02:09:29,209 --> 02:09:33,917
They had hidden that bomb,
and I've found it.

827
02:09:34,001 --> 02:09:36,626
The old building, bunker four.

828
02:09:41,917 --> 02:09:45,709
I suppose there must be a principle.

829
02:09:46,917 --> 02:09:49,792
Never do anything that can't be undone.

830
02:09:49,876 --> 02:09:52,876
I understand everything,
I'm not some maniac.

831
02:09:56,584 --> 02:10:01,792
But as long as this pit lies open,
accessible to any scum,

832
02:10:04,792 --> 02:10:06,709
I can get no peace, no sleep.

833
02:10:14,417 --> 02:10:17,876
Or maybe, my innermost won't let me do it?

834
02:10:23,751 --> 02:10:27,042
Poor man, some problem
he's invented for himself.

835
02:10:50,501 --> 02:10:51,834
Give it to me!

836
02:11:06,584 --> 02:11:08,084
Give it to me!

837
02:11:13,126 --> 02:11:15,251
You're a civilized man, aren't you?

838
02:11:22,709 --> 02:11:26,209
- Why? What's the matter with you?
- You, lousy hypocrite.

839
02:11:28,126 --> 02:11:32,292
Why? What have I done to you?

840
02:11:33,334 --> 02:11:37,626
He wants to destroy your hope!

841
02:12:00,709 --> 02:12:04,292
That's all people have got left on this earth!

842
02:12:05,209 --> 02:12:10,251
It's the only place they can come to

843
02:12:10,334 --> 02:12:12,417
if there's no hope left for them.

844
02:12:15,042 --> 02:12:17,376
You yourself have come here!

845
02:12:17,459 --> 02:12:20,584
Why destroy hope then?

846
02:12:20,667 --> 02:12:22,667
Shut up!

847
02:12:25,042 --> 02:12:27,334
I can see through you.

848
02:12:28,584 --> 02:12:30,876
You don't give a damn about people.

849
02:12:31,876 --> 02:12:35,001
You just make money, using our

850
02:12:36,584 --> 02:12:37,584
anguish!

851
02:12:37,667 --> 02:12:39,251
It's not even the money.

852
02:12:39,334 --> 02:12:43,084
You're enjoying yourself here.
You're like God Almighty here.

853
02:12:43,167 --> 02:12:47,584
You, a hypocritical louse,
decide who is to live and who is to die.

854
02:12:47,667 --> 02:12:50,167
He deliberates.

855
02:12:51,501 --> 02:12:55,917
Now I see why you stalkers
never enter the room yourselves.

856
02:12:56,001 --> 02:13:01,209
You revel in all that power,
that mystery, your authority!

857
02:13:01,292 --> 02:13:03,584
What else is there to wish for?

858
02:13:03,667 --> 02:13:07,167
It's not true! You... You're mistaken.

859
02:13:12,167 --> 02:13:14,709
A stalker must not enter the room.

860
02:13:14,792 --> 02:13:18,751
A stalker must not even enter the Zone
with an ulterior motive.

861
02:13:19,542 --> 02:13:21,334
Remember Porcupine?

862
02:13:24,167 --> 02:13:26,334
Yes, you're right, I'm a louse.

863
02:13:26,417 --> 02:13:30,001
I haven't done any good in this world,
and I can't do any.

864
02:13:32,209 --> 02:13:34,792
I couldn't give anything even to my wife.

865
02:13:35,709 --> 02:13:40,292
I can't have any friends either.
But don't take what's mine!

866
02:13:40,376 --> 02:13:45,167
They'd already taken everything from me
back there, behind the barbed wire.

867
02:13:48,376 --> 02:13:53,584
So all that's mine is here.
You understand? Here! In the Zone!

868
02:13:55,209 --> 02:13:59,626
My happiness, my freedom,
my self-respect, it's all here!

869
02:14:02,042 --> 02:14:05,584
I bring here people like me,
desperate and tormented.

870
02:14:05,667 --> 02:14:09,917
People who have nothing else to hope for.

871
02:14:11,001 --> 02:14:13,251
And I can help them!

872
02:14:13,334 --> 02:14:17,126
No one else can help them.
Only I, the louse, can!

873
02:14:19,667 --> 02:14:22,667
I'm so happy to be able to help them
that I want to cry.

874
02:14:23,626 --> 02:14:26,542
And that's all. I don't want anything more.

875
02:14:48,459 --> 02:14:51,209
I don't know. Maybe.

876
02:14:51,292 --> 02:14:53,959
Anyway, excuse me, but...

877
02:14:55,084 --> 02:14:57,376
You're just God's fool.

878
02:14:59,292 --> 02:15:02,417
You have no idea what's going on here.

879
02:15:06,042 --> 02:15:09,376
Why do you think
Porcupine hanged himself?

880
02:15:09,459 --> 02:15:13,126
He came to the Zone
with a mercenary motive.

881
02:15:13,209 --> 02:15:16,042
He made his brother die
in the meat mincer because of money.

882
02:15:16,126 --> 02:15:20,167
I know. But why did he hang himself?

883
02:15:20,251 --> 02:15:24,376
Why didn't he come here again,
not for money, but for his brother?

884
02:15:25,751 --> 02:15:27,459
As a way of repenting.

885
02:15:27,542 --> 02:15:31,917
He wanted to... I don't know.
He hanged himself a week later.

886
02:15:32,001 --> 02:15:35,459
Because he realised that
not just any wish comes true here,

887
02:15:35,542 --> 02:15:38,334
only your innermost wish.

888
02:15:46,667 --> 02:15:49,792
Not what you would shout
at the top of your voice.

889
02:15:57,209 --> 02:16:00,084
What comes true here is
only what's in line with your nature,

890
02:16:00,167 --> 02:16:03,626
with your essence,
of which you know nothing.

891
02:16:03,709 --> 02:16:07,459
But it's there, in you,
directing you all your life.

892
02:16:08,626 --> 02:16:11,126
You didn't understand anything,
Leatherstocking.

893
02:16:11,209 --> 02:16:13,334
It wasn't greed that finished Porcupine off.

894
02:16:13,417 --> 02:16:17,126
He was crawling in this puddle,
begging to bring his brother back.

895
02:16:17,209 --> 02:16:22,167
But what he got was only money,
and he couldn't get anything else,

896
02:16:23,209 --> 02:16:26,667
because render unto Porcupine
the things that are Porcupine's!

897
02:16:26,751 --> 02:16:30,917
And things like conscience, anguish,
they are just inventions.

898
02:16:31,751 --> 02:16:34,209
He realised that and hanged himself.

899
02:16:38,834 --> 02:16:41,126
I'm not going to your room.

900
02:16:42,626 --> 02:16:47,917
I have no wish to pour my filth
over somebody's head.

901
02:16:48,001 --> 02:16:50,209
Even yours.

902
02:16:50,292 --> 02:16:53,042
And then to put my neck into
the noose, like Porcupine.

903
02:16:54,084 --> 02:16:59,334
I'd rather drink myself to death
in my mansion, in peace and quiet.

904
02:17:01,501 --> 02:17:07,251
You don't understand anything
about human beings, Chingachgook,

905
02:17:07,334 --> 02:17:10,084
if you take people like me to the Zone.

906
02:17:17,876 --> 02:17:19,584
And something else.

907
02:17:21,126 --> 02:17:25,292
Why do you think this miracle really exists?

908
02:17:26,709 --> 02:17:31,376
Who told you that wishes
actually come true here?

909
02:17:33,709 --> 02:17:38,292
Have you seen a single man
who's been made happy here?

910
02:17:39,667 --> 02:17:41,751
Was it Porcupine?

911
02:17:46,542 --> 02:17:51,001
As a matter of fact,
who told you about the Zone,

912
02:17:51,084 --> 02:17:55,251
about Porcupine, about that room?

913
02:17:56,334 --> 02:17:57,584
He did.

914
02:19:02,584 --> 02:19:05,209
Then it makes no sense to me at all.

915
02:19:06,542 --> 02:19:09,251
What's the use coming here?

916
02:20:32,292 --> 02:20:33,959
It's so quiet.

917
02:20:35,459 --> 02:20:37,584
Can you feel it?

918
02:20:42,251 --> 02:20:45,376
What the heck... Why not chuck it all?

919
02:20:47,209 --> 02:20:52,001
Take my wife, Monkey, and move over here.

920
02:20:55,334 --> 02:20:56,876
<i>For good.</i>

921
02:20:59,209 --> 02:21:04,209
There's no one here.
No one can hurt them here.

922
02:25:19,042 --> 02:25:20,626
So you're back.

923
02:25:26,751 --> 02:25:29,042
Where did you get this?

924
02:25:30,126 --> 02:25:34,501
He got attached to me.
I couldn't leave him there.

925
02:25:51,334 --> 02:25:56,959
Well, shall we go? Monkey is waiting.

926
02:26:00,667 --> 02:26:02,167
Are you coming?

927
02:26:16,417 --> 02:26:19,001
Do any of you need a dog?

928
02:26:21,834 --> 02:26:25,376
I've got five of them at home.

929
02:26:34,376 --> 02:26:37,709
You love dogs, then, don't you?

930
02:26:37,792 --> 02:26:39,042
What?

931
02:26:39,126 --> 02:26:40,376
That's very good.

932
02:26:46,376 --> 02:26:49,209
All right, let's go.

933
02:29:51,209 --> 02:29:53,751
You can't even imagine how tired I am.

934
02:29:55,334 --> 02:29:57,001
God only knows!

935
02:29:59,084 --> 02:30:03,542
Calling themselves intellectuals,
those writers and scientists!

936
02:30:03,626 --> 02:30:05,084
Don't get so excited.

937
02:30:05,917 --> 02:30:08,542
They don't believe in anything.

938
02:30:08,626 --> 02:30:15,459
They've got the organ with which
one believes atrophied for lack of use.

939
02:30:17,376 --> 02:30:20,667
Stop it. Come on. Go to bed. Don't lie here.

940
02:30:21,542 --> 02:30:25,917
It's too damp here for you.
You shouldn't lie here.

941
02:30:29,667 --> 02:30:31,459
Take it off.

942
02:31:42,292 --> 02:31:44,167
Oh, God, what people.

943
02:31:44,251 --> 02:31:47,626
Calm down, it's not their fault.

944
02:31:48,709 --> 02:31:51,376
You ought to pity them,
not be angry with them.

945
02:31:51,459 --> 02:31:54,376
Haven't you seen them?
They've got empty eyes.

946
02:32:06,709 --> 02:32:09,542
The only thing they can think about

947
02:32:10,334 --> 02:32:13,042
is how not to sell themselves too cheaply!

948
02:32:13,126 --> 02:32:17,001
How to get as much as possible
for their every emotional movement.

949
02:32:19,126 --> 02:32:23,417
They know they were
"born for a purpose," "called upon."

950
02:32:26,459 --> 02:32:28,709
After all, they live "only once."

951
02:32:30,417 --> 02:32:33,626
Can people like that believe in anything?

952
02:32:34,709 --> 02:32:37,709
Stop it, calm down.

953
02:32:38,626 --> 02:32:42,376
Try to sleep, will you? Go to sleep.

954
02:32:46,584 --> 02:32:52,459
And nobody believes.
Not only those two. Nobody!

955
02:32:53,376 --> 02:32:56,084
Who am I going to take there?

956
02:32:59,376 --> 02:33:00,876
Oh, God.

957
02:33:01,792 --> 02:33:04,084
And what's most awful

958
02:33:05,792 --> 02:33:07,917
is that no one needs it.

959
02:33:08,001 --> 02:33:12,334
No one needs that room.
And all my efforts are just in vain.

960
02:33:13,584 --> 02:33:16,709
Why do you say that? Stop it.

961
02:33:22,751 --> 02:33:25,876
I'm not going there with anybody again.

962
02:33:28,167 --> 02:33:32,376
Do you want me to go with you?

963
02:33:33,459 --> 02:33:34,959
Where?

964
02:33:35,042 --> 02:33:37,959
You think I've got nothing to ask for?

965
02:33:42,584 --> 02:33:43,959
No.

966
02:33:47,667 --> 02:33:50,376
- You can't go there.
- Why not?

967
02:33:53,334 --> 02:33:54,792
No, no.

968
02:33:59,751 --> 02:34:03,917
What if it wouldn't work with you, either?

969
02:34:39,626 --> 02:34:42,917
You know, my mother was against it.

970
02:34:44,834 --> 02:34:49,584
You've probably noticed already
that he's not of this world.

971
02:34:52,417 --> 02:34:54,709
All our neighbourhood laughed at him.

972
02:34:54,792 --> 02:34:57,959
He was such a bungler, he looked so pitiful.

973
02:35:00,001 --> 02:35:03,626
My mother used to say, "He's a stalker,

974
02:35:03,709 --> 02:35:06,709
"he's doomed, he's an eternal prisoner!

975
02:35:06,792 --> 02:35:09,751
"Don't you know what kind of children
the stalkers have?"

976
02:35:09,834 --> 02:35:12,959
And I... I didn't even argue with her.

977
02:35:15,709 --> 02:35:18,709
I knew it all myself, that he was doomed,

978
02:35:18,792 --> 02:35:23,667
that he was an eternal prisoner,
and about the children.

979
02:35:27,709 --> 02:35:29,376
Only what could I do?

980
02:35:29,459 --> 02:35:32,542
I was sure I'd be happy with him.

981
02:35:35,126 --> 02:35:37,834
Of course, I knew I'd have a lot of sorrow too.

982
02:35:38,917 --> 02:35:43,626
But it's better to have a bitter happiness than

983
02:35:45,501 --> 02:35:47,584
a grey, dull life.

984
02:35:52,334 --> 02:35:56,126
Perhaps, I thought it all up later.

985
02:36:05,501 --> 02:36:09,459
But then he approached me and said,
"Come with me."

986
02:36:09,542 --> 02:36:14,584
And I did, and never regretted it.

987
02:36:18,584 --> 02:36:19,959
Never.

988
02:36:22,667 --> 02:36:25,667
We had a lot of sorrow,

989
02:36:25,751 --> 02:36:28,126
a lot of fear, and a lot of shame.

990
02:36:28,209 --> 02:36:31,917
But I never regretted it,
and I never envied anyone.

991
02:36:34,042 --> 02:36:39,667
It's just our fate, our life, that's how we are.

992
02:36:45,417 --> 02:36:49,209
And if we hadn't had our misfortunes,
we wouldn't have been better off.

993
02:36:50,834 --> 02:36:52,459
It would have been worse.

994
02:36:55,084 --> 02:37:00,251
Because in that case, there wouldn't
have been any happiness.

995
02:37:02,459 --> 02:37:04,667
And there wouldn't have been any hope.

996
02:37:55,876 --> 02:37:59,626
<i>"I love your eyes, my darling friend</i>

997
02:37:59,709 --> 02:38:02,792
<i>"Their play, so passionate and brightning</i>

998
02:38:04,251 --> 02:38:08,001
<i>"When a sudden stare up you send</i>

999
02:38:08,084 --> 02:38:11,376
<i>"And like a heaven-blown lightning</i>

1000
02:38:11,459 --> 02:38:15,626
<i>"It'd take in all from end to end</i>

1001
02:38:15,709 --> 02:38:19,292
<i>"But there's more that I admire</i>

1002
02:38:19,376 --> 02:38:22,792
<i>"Your eyes when they're downcast</i>

1003
02:38:22,876 --> 02:38:26,542
<i>"In bursts of love-inspired fire</i>

1004
02:38:26,626 --> 02:38:30,667
<i>"And through the eyelash goes fast</i>

1005
02:38:30,751 --> 02:38:37,751
<i>"A sombre, dull call of desire"</i>

1006
02:41:24,959 --> 02:41:32,251
The End
