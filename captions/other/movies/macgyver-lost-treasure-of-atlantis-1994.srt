1
00:00:31,267 --> 00:00:32,868
Look, right there.

2
00:00:32,868 --> 00:00:33,801
A chamber.

3
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:34,834
Okay.

4
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,200
I see it.
Go on.

5
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,434
Get off my foot.

6
00:00:37,434 --> 00:00:38,000
Oh, will you--?

7
00:00:41,868 --> 00:00:42,501
Go on.

8
00:00:43,901 --> 00:00:44,501
Do you see anything?

9
00:00:45,801 --> 00:00:46,467
Spiders.

10
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:49,834
Now get moving, MacGyver.

11
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:51,367
Get moving, don't dawdle.

12
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:52,000
All right.

13
00:01:11,934 --> 00:01:13,968
Look.
Huh?

14
00:01:13,968 --> 00:01:14,834
There.

15
00:01:15,501 --> 00:01:16,667
A sigma.

16
00:01:18,634 --> 00:01:19,934
Ah.

17
00:01:19,934 --> 00:01:23,133
Do you recall
your Greek, MacGyver?

18
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:24,801
Sigma is the letter...

19
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:26,734
S.
Yes.

20
00:01:26,734 --> 00:01:28,367
As in Solon.

21
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:29,367
It says

22
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:32,734
"Atlantis anaduotai."

23
00:01:32,734 --> 00:01:34,567
"Atlantis rises."

24
00:01:34,567 --> 00:01:36,267
We've found the medal.

25
00:01:36,267 --> 00:01:37,901
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What?

26
00:01:37,901 --> 00:01:39,133
Wait.

27
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:40,267
Oh, what, you want a photograph?

28
00:01:44,834 --> 00:01:46,033
Thank you.

29
00:01:46,033 --> 00:01:47,934
That's not what I had in mind.
What?

30
00:01:47,934 --> 00:01:49,868
Just hang on a second, will you?

31
00:01:58,467 --> 00:01:59,968
Hello.

32
00:02:00,701 --> 00:02:01,467
What is it?

33
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,968
Uh...

34
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:15,868
Hm.

35
00:02:25,033 --> 00:02:26,501
What's that?

36
00:02:26,501 --> 00:02:27,167
That's neat.

37
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
Neat?

38
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:30,701
Yeah.
Huh.

39
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:34,767
At last.

40
00:02:34,767 --> 00:02:36,534
At last, it's wonderful.

41
00:02:36,534 --> 00:02:37,601
Let's get out of here.

42
00:02:37,601 --> 00:02:38,968
All in good time.

43
00:02:38,968 --> 00:02:43,734
I must take a closer look
at this ingenious...device.

44
00:02:43,734 --> 00:02:46,501
Absolutely
marvelous workmanship.

45
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:48,200
Fiendishly clever.

46
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,567
Eh, what sort of trap
do you suppose it sets off?

47
00:02:52,934 --> 00:02:53,701
No.

48
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:16,767
Hey.

49
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:32,167
I'll entertain
any ideas, MacGyver.

50
00:03:48,234 --> 00:03:49,300
MacGyver.

51
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:00,200
Well, do you have
any ideas?

52
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,968
Oh, man.

53
00:04:09,968 --> 00:04:12,267
Thousands of years ago,

54
00:04:12,267 --> 00:04:15,033
before time itself
was measured,

55
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:19,801
as we know it,
there was Atlantis.

56
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,234
It was a great city,

57
00:04:21,234 --> 00:04:24,334
dedicated to art and science.

58
00:04:24,334 --> 00:04:25,767
The people of Atlantis

59
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:28,367
built their city
at the foot of a volcano,

60
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:31,100
which they used
to make heat and power.

61
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,834
They worshipped
a mysterious object

62
00:04:33,834 --> 00:04:35,834
called the Torch of Truth,

63
00:04:35,834 --> 00:04:39,501
said to possess the light
of universal wisdom.

64
00:04:39,501 --> 00:04:44,434
For centuries, Atlantis
was the center of the world,

65
00:04:44,434 --> 00:04:47,267
and the world was at peace.

66
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:48,834
Then, in an instant,

67
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:50,634
the volcano
that heated their homes

68
00:04:50,634 --> 00:04:52,667
and powered
their machines erupted.

69
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,267
Now fleeing the ruined city,

70
00:04:54,267 --> 00:04:57,534
a few survivors gathered
the great wealth of Atlantis,

71
00:04:57,534 --> 00:05:01,934
and hid it in a place
they called the Tower of Fear.

72
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:06,033
They wrote that story in a book
made out of platinum pages.

73
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:07,400
Heh, platinum, heh, heh.

74
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,701
Ahem-- Yes.
Uh...

75
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:15,100
Thousands of years passed,
until 590 B.C.,

76
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,100
when a Greek scholar
journeyed to Egypt.

77
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,234
His name was Solon.

78
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:23,167
There he is.

79
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:26,968
It was there he discovered
two relics of Atlantis.

80
00:05:26,968 --> 00:05:28,567
Ah, one was the platinum book,

81
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:31,834
and the other was
the Torch of Truth itself.

82
00:05:31,834 --> 00:05:35,701
Solon gathered his disciples
and presented them with an Ark,

83
00:05:35,701 --> 00:05:37,868
in which he'd locked
the Torch of Truth.

84
00:05:37,868 --> 00:05:40,434
And taking the only key,

85
00:05:40,434 --> 00:05:42,801
Solon left
with the platinum book

86
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:46,133
to search
for the Treasure of Atlantis.

87
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:48,601
And vanished... without a trace.

88
00:05:49,634 --> 00:05:51,501
That is...

89
00:05:51,501 --> 00:05:53,067
until five years ago,

90
00:05:53,067 --> 00:05:58,667
when I found this very same key
in the ruins of Thera.

91
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:02,467
I am convinced that this is
the key to the Ark of Solon.

92
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:04,834
And I propose to follow
in his footsteps

93
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:06,868
and find the Treasure of Atlantis.

94
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:08,567
I think
we've heard quite enough.

95
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:10,701
Mister Director,
now that I have the medallion,

96
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:12,968
I'm certain
I can prove my theory.

97
00:06:12,968 --> 00:06:15,234
If the Academy will,
eh, kindly, uh,

98
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:17,834
fund my next expedition.

99
00:06:17,834 --> 00:06:20,501
The Royal Academy of
Archaeological Science

100
00:06:20,501 --> 00:06:23,634
finances the serious study
of history.

101
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:27,801
We have no interest
in your obsession with Atlantis.

102
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:30,634
As for this artifact
it will stay right here,

103
00:06:30,634 --> 00:06:33,000
as part of the Academy's
permanent collection.

104
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
No, but I beg you to reconsider.

105
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,767
Rest assured, we will.

106
00:06:36,767 --> 00:06:38,634
In fact, I strongly recommend

107
00:06:38,634 --> 00:06:42,033
that the Board reconsider
your tenure here.

108
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:44,467
Reconsider my tenure?

109
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,100
Ah.

110
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,534
Come on, MacGyver.

111
00:07:25,534 --> 00:07:27,501
Still dawdling
after all these years.

112
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:28,667
You haven't changed.

113
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:30,200
What, you have?

114
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,601
You're the only man I know

115
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:33,400
who'd plan an archaeological dig

116
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,868
in the middle of a civil war.

117
00:07:34,868 --> 00:07:37,267
Whatever happened
to that eager young student

118
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:40,067
at university who was so anxious

119
00:07:40,067 --> 00:07:42,634
to explore ancient ruins and solve

120
00:07:42,634 --> 00:07:42,701
the mysteries of the ages?

121
00:07:45,934 --> 00:07:48,000
He remembers
his last experience with you.

122
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,033
Ha-ha-ha. You're not still
bothered by that minor mishap?

123
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:52,834
We were buried alive.

124
00:07:52,834 --> 00:07:54,000
That's minor?

125
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,133
If I taught you
anything at university,

126
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:58,400
it's that the search for truth...

127
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,868
is never easy, MacGyver.

128
00:08:00,868 --> 00:08:01,868
Oh.

129
00:08:01,868 --> 00:08:05,033
Besides, we got out.
Thanks to you.

130
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:09,400
And the medallion proved
that Solon was at Thera,

131
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,901
looking for the Treasure
of Atlantis.

132
00:08:13,968 --> 00:08:15,534
Professor Carson didn't think so.

133
00:08:15,534 --> 00:08:16,601
Carson!

134
00:08:16,601 --> 00:08:18,067
That pompous fool.

135
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:20,968
He still thinks
that Atlantis is a fairy tale.

136
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:22,267
Fairy tale, I ask you.

137
00:08:22,267 --> 00:08:23,601
But I'll prove him wrong,

138
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:25,334
when we find the Torch of Truth.

139
00:08:26,701 --> 00:08:28,367
You really think it's here, huh?

140
00:08:28,367 --> 00:08:29,400
Oh, yes.

141
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,534
After Solon left on his quest,

142
00:08:31,534 --> 00:08:35,167
his disciples left Athens
and sailed to England,

143
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:39,067
mm, uh, looking for refuge
in caves near E-Exeter.

144
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:42,367
Over generations
they formed a religion.

145
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,901
The Cult...

146
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:45,901
of Solon.

147
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:47,567
Splendid.

148
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:50,701
Yes, uh, the Cult,
or descendents of the Cult,

149
00:08:50,701 --> 00:08:52,834
uh, lived peacefully
in England

150
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:54,067
for hundreds of years,

151
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,968
and that is
until the Romans invaded

152
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:58,067
and then they were
hunted down and slaughtered.

153
00:08:58,067 --> 00:09:00,601
But a few... survivors escaped,

154
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:03,601
uh, with the Ark and the Torch,

155
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:05,634
and sailed from England.

156
00:09:07,868 --> 00:09:09,934
And came to these catacombs.

157
00:09:09,934 --> 00:09:12,200
And then died.

158
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,734
But not before hiding
the Torch somewhere down here.

159
00:09:15,734 --> 00:09:19,167
I'd bet my life on it.

160
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:20,968
Them's some pretty
high stakes, professor.

161
00:09:20,968 --> 00:09:22,601
Let's hope you don't
lose that bet, huh?

162
00:09:22,601 --> 00:09:23,968
Oh, relax, my boy.

163
00:09:23,968 --> 00:09:26,767
The soldiers don't even know
the catacombs are here.

164
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:45,868
Colonel Petrovic...

165
00:10:03,234 --> 00:10:04,234
Well...

166
00:10:04,234 --> 00:10:05,634
Wa...

167
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:11,334
This must be the oldest part
of the catacombs.

168
00:10:11,334 --> 00:10:11,567
These must be the remains

169
00:10:14,501 --> 00:10:18,334
of early Christians
who hid from the Romans.

170
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:21,367
Over centuries,
others followed,

171
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:24,033
like the Cult...
of Solon.

172
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:26,133
Professor, please.

173
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:27,667
Let's skip the lecture,

174
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:30,334
find what we came for
and get out of here.

175
00:10:30,334 --> 00:10:32,834
There's a civil war
going on upstairs.

176
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:35,567
Oh, nonsense, United Nations
ordered a cease-fire.

177
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:38,100
Yeah, well, I don't
think they care.

178
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,501
Oh, these people never got on.

179
00:10:39,501 --> 00:10:41,400
They've been waging war
amongst themselves

180
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,501
since the 12th century.

181
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:44,834
When I find the Torch of Truth,

182
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:47,601
we can use it to continue
Solon's quest,

183
00:10:47,601 --> 00:10:50,000
and find the Treasure of Atlantis,

184
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,534
and there won't
be any more wars.

185
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:52,667
I can feel it.

186
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:53,901
I know it.
We're close.

187
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,400
Professor...

188
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,267
The Sigma.

189
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,467
It's the sign of Solon.

190
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,334
MacGyver...

191
00:11:34,334 --> 00:11:39,033
it's...the Ark... of Solon.

192
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:43,133
Oh... Oh...

193
00:11:43,133 --> 00:11:44,367
It looks so beautiful.

194
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:48,100
Yeah, it's gorgeous.

195
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,133
Now can we get it
and us out of here?

196
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:51,534
But just think.

197
00:11:51,534 --> 00:11:55,501
Inside this Ark rests
the Torch of Truth.

198
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,300
Ah, yes.

199
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,734
"Gods march in rank."

200
00:12:02,734 --> 00:12:04,300
Yes! Yes.

201
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,767
"And Hecate races
in the heavens,

202
00:12:07,767 --> 00:12:11,434
"enters the gates of Hades,

203
00:12:11,434 --> 00:12:16,567
"and the Book shall summon
the power of the ancient ones.

204
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:23,901
"Offer the Torch of Truth
to the Temple of Ages,

205
00:12:23,901 --> 00:12:29,033
and the Treasure
of Atlantis...shall rise."

206
00:12:33,467 --> 00:12:35,767
It's the riddle
of Solon.

207
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:38,000
Great!
Now can we go?

208
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:42,234
You are going nowhere.

209
00:12:42,234 --> 00:12:43,234
What?

210
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:47,934
What is it?

211
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:05,701
Ah!

212
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,767
Tell me who you were spying for.

213
00:13:07,767 --> 00:13:08,767
United Nations?

214
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:10,167
U.S. Intelligence?
Who?

215
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:11,267
We're not spies.

216
00:13:13,634 --> 00:13:14,667
Ah, yes, you are, uh...

217
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:17,234
...historians.

218
00:13:17,234 --> 00:13:18,334
Historians?

219
00:13:18,334 --> 00:13:21,200
I happen to be
a professor of archaeology.

220
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:23,200
Give me a light.

221
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:31,234
Colonel...

222
00:13:32,767 --> 00:13:35,701
does that box really look
like standard espionage gear?

223
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,934
A clever prop to lend
authenticity to your cover.

224
00:13:39,934 --> 00:13:41,534
A prop?

225
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:43,601
That Ark is a priceless relic,
you buffoon.

226
00:13:46,434 --> 00:13:47,667
In time of war,

227
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:49,601
the penalty for spying
is immediate execution.

228
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:50,834
What war?

229
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:54,067
This area is supposed
to be protected by the U.N.

230
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,534
You are remarkably
well-informed

231
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,801
for one who claims
not to be a spy.

232
00:13:57,801 --> 00:13:59,767
I watch the news.

233
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:01,300
Then you will know
that this region

234
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,067
belongs to my people
and we will take it.

235
00:14:04,067 --> 00:14:06,133
Even if it means
killing innocent people

236
00:14:06,133 --> 00:14:07,534
who happen to live here?

237
00:14:07,534 --> 00:14:09,534
We must cleanse the area.

238
00:14:09,534 --> 00:14:11,534
You're talking
ethnic cleansing.

239
00:14:11,534 --> 00:14:13,033
That's racial genocide.

240
00:14:13,033 --> 00:14:14,968
Look, pal, the whole world
has been watching

241
00:14:14,968 --> 00:14:17,100
what's been going on around here.

242
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,133
Now, you can call it
whatever you want.

243
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:21,300
But it's murder.
Pure and simple.

244
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,434
Exactly, now for the last time,

245
00:14:23,434 --> 00:14:25,634
we were sent by the Royal Academy

246
00:14:25,634 --> 00:14:28,701
of Archaeological Science
in London, England.

247
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,767
You are already dead.

248
00:14:31,534 --> 00:14:34,334
It is only a question
of how you will die.

249
00:14:34,334 --> 00:14:39,367
Like men, with dignity,
or screaming in agony.

250
00:14:39,367 --> 00:14:41,734
Either way, you will tell me
who you are spying for.

251
00:14:41,734 --> 00:14:41,868
Hey.

252
00:14:42,834 --> 00:14:44,434
Stop that, MacGyver.
Ah!

253
00:14:44,434 --> 00:14:45,701
Leave him.
Leave him alone.

254
00:14:45,701 --> 00:14:46,667
No.

255
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:50,067
Thank you for your knife.

256
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,567
This will make a great cigar box.

257
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:04,467
Gentlemen...

258
00:15:04,467 --> 00:15:07,334
I wouldn't come too close
to the door if I were you.

259
00:15:24,601 --> 00:15:26,100
Have someone guard
the prisoners.

260
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,100
You, stay here.

261
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:27,701
Yes, sir.

262
00:15:29,234 --> 00:15:32,200
Of all the asinine,
fool-headed behavior.

263
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,601
You might have been killed.

264
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:34,601
For what?

265
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:35,133
For nothing.

266
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:39,100
Well, what good is that?

267
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:45,601
Have a little faith, professor.

268
00:15:45,601 --> 00:15:48,067
I'd prefer a hacksaw.

269
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:51,267
I'm sorry, MacGyver,
I'm afraid we're done for.

270
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:53,834
I should never have
dragged you into this.

271
00:15:53,834 --> 00:15:55,534
Well, no one twisted my arm.

272
00:15:55,534 --> 00:15:57,234
No, you don't understand.

273
00:15:57,234 --> 00:15:58,467
I lied.

274
00:15:58,467 --> 00:16:01,300
The Academy didn't send me.

275
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,334
In fact, the, uh, directors,

276
00:16:03,334 --> 00:16:04,667
uh, revoked my tenure.

277
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:08,133
I mean to put it simply...

278
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,234
I was sacked.

279
00:16:11,234 --> 00:16:13,033
Who financed the expedition?

280
00:16:13,033 --> 00:16:15,534
I did, I thought
that if I could find the Torch,

281
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:17,901
prove Atlantis really existed,

282
00:16:17,901 --> 00:16:20,534
then the Academy
would reinstate me.

283
00:16:20,534 --> 00:16:21,901
It took all my savings
to get this far.

284
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:25,701
I could barely afford
the telegram I sent

285
00:16:25,701 --> 00:16:27,100
asking you to come.

286
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,968
I hate to deceive you
like that, but, uh,

287
00:16:30,968 --> 00:16:32,367
I had no other option.

288
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,534
Uh, you must believe me.

289
00:16:34,534 --> 00:16:37,300
I was at the end of my rope,
MacGyver.

290
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,200
Oh, please understand, I mean,

291
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,100
y-you were the only person
that I could turn to.

292
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,000
Story of my life.

293
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,200
Anyway, it's useless,

294
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,734
I mean, the Ark's
in the hands of a fanatic

295
00:16:47,734 --> 00:16:49,200
who thinks that it's a cigar box.

296
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,100
And the key that opens it
is a thousand miles

297
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,801
away at the Royal Academy
in London.

298
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:05,367
MacGyver, i-is there a purpose
behind these acrobatics?

299
00:17:06,434 --> 00:17:08,334
Oh, I hope so.

300
00:17:21,801 --> 00:17:22,534
Watch your eyes.

301
00:18:07,934 --> 00:18:08,100
Bravo.

302
00:18:09,467 --> 00:18:12,267
I always said you were
my brightest student.

303
00:18:12,267 --> 00:18:14,634
If only you had applied
yourself at university.

304
00:18:14,634 --> 00:18:15,634
Professor!

305
00:18:15,634 --> 00:18:17,601
Quite right.
Carry on.

306
00:19:20,234 --> 00:19:22,234
Looks like that gate's
the only way out of here.

307
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:26,067
Come on.

308
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,567
Put this on.
What?

309
00:19:37,934 --> 00:19:39,400
I'm not leaving without the Ark.

310
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,667
Professor--

311
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:43,100
MacGyver, the Torch of Truth
is in that Ark.

312
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,100
I'm not leaving
without it.

313
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:48,501
All right.

314
00:19:50,634 --> 00:19:51,901
Understood.

315
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:53,000
The final shipment of arms

316
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,801
is being unloaded now,
Colonel Petrovic.

317
00:19:54,801 --> 00:19:55,868
Good.

318
00:19:55,868 --> 00:19:57,534
A schedule has been
brought forward.

319
00:19:57,534 --> 00:19:58,934
We attack in two hours.

320
00:20:04,534 --> 00:20:06,200
If the prisoners are spies,

321
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,534
the U.N. forces
may know of our plans.

322
00:20:09,534 --> 00:20:11,868
We should strike at once.

323
00:20:11,868 --> 00:20:13,467
Could these men
be telling the truth?

324
00:20:13,467 --> 00:20:15,534
That old chest--
It does not matter.

325
00:20:15,534 --> 00:20:17,267
They are to be
executed immediately.

326
00:20:40,901 --> 00:20:43,467
Those barbarians must have
tried to force it open. Look.

327
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:45,701
I don't know, professor.

328
00:20:45,701 --> 00:20:47,434
This scratch
looks pretty old.

329
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:56,901
The Ark's magnetic.

330
00:20:56,901 --> 00:20:58,167
Yeah, let's check it
out later, come on.

331
00:23:16,133 --> 00:23:17,501
There's no engine!

332
00:23:32,267 --> 00:23:33,534
That'll keep 'em out for a while.

333
00:23:33,534 --> 00:23:34,968
And us in.
Shh, quiet!

334
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,133
Sound the alarm.

335
00:24:00,868 --> 00:24:02,968
Come on, MacGyver,
they know we've escaped.

336
00:24:02,968 --> 00:24:05,133
We haven't yet.
Give me a hand here.

337
00:24:16,834 --> 00:24:19,701
No one left through the gate.

338
00:24:19,701 --> 00:24:22,267
Search every inch of this place.

339
00:24:22,267 --> 00:24:24,367
Find them and kill them.

340
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:18,467
Load it up, professor.

341
00:25:18,467 --> 00:25:18,567
What?

342
00:25:25,834 --> 00:25:27,701
You sure this will work?
Nope.

343
00:25:27,701 --> 00:25:30,601
Good.
That's the MacGyver I know.

344
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,834
Open this up.

345
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,234
Looks like they're gonna
open the door for us.

346
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,767
Get some men over here!

347
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,234
Yes, sir.

348
00:26:19,601 --> 00:26:21,167
Now what are you doing?

349
00:26:21,167 --> 00:26:23,534
Trying to stop some
ethnic cleansing.

350
00:26:39,601 --> 00:26:41,033
Buckle up.

351
00:27:43,634 --> 00:27:45,200
It worked! It worked!

352
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,100
Ha-ha-ha!
I knew it would.

353
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,801
I always said you were
my brightest student.

354
00:27:52,734 --> 00:27:54,634
It worked.

355
00:28:01,033 --> 00:28:03,968
All living things
contain carbon.

356
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,934
In fact, the term "organic"
is often defined as

357
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,534
"containing carbon."

358
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,434
One carbon isotope present
in all living forms

359
00:28:18,434 --> 00:28:21,567
is carbon-14,
which has a half-life

360
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:25,601
of 5,730 years.

361
00:28:25,601 --> 00:28:27,734
Meaning
in that amount of time,

362
00:28:27,734 --> 00:28:32,167
half the carbon-14
of a dead organism will decay.

363
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:35,334
By measuring the ratio
of the remaining carbon-14,

364
00:28:35,334 --> 00:28:38,400
we can determine the life
of an organic sample,

365
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,934
such as the cloth
of an Egyptian mummy,

366
00:28:41,934 --> 00:28:44,467
or the ashes of a caveman's fire.

367
00:28:47,634 --> 00:28:50,334
Tomorrow I'll demonstrate
this process

368
00:28:50,334 --> 00:28:51,567
in the university lab.

369
00:29:00,968 --> 00:29:02,067
Hiya.

370
00:29:02,067 --> 00:29:04,367
MacGyver.

371
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,033
Is it really you?

372
00:29:06,033 --> 00:29:07,200
I think so.

373
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,667
How are you, Kelly?

374
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:11,200
I didn't think I'd see you again
after you left Thera.

375
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,901
What's it been, four years?

376
00:29:12,901 --> 00:29:14,100
Five.

377
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,501
Ah.

378
00:29:15,501 --> 00:29:19,000
This is for you, teach.

379
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,133
Are you finally
flirting with me?

380
00:29:21,133 --> 00:29:22,167
Um...

381
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:24,000
Actually, it's a bribe.

382
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,501
I need your help.

383
00:29:25,501 --> 00:29:28,934
Funny. Didn't think
you needed anyone's help.

384
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:30,400
You'd be surprised.

385
00:29:32,701 --> 00:29:34,901
What is that?

386
00:29:37,834 --> 00:29:39,801
Some kind of oxidized matter.

387
00:29:39,801 --> 00:29:42,567
Yeah, it's off an artifact
Professor Atticus and I found.

388
00:29:42,567 --> 00:29:44,701
"Atlantis" Atticus?

389
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:46,567
My grandfather
still talks about him,

390
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:47,868
none too fondly,
I might add.

391
00:29:47,868 --> 00:29:48,901
Yeah, I'll bet.

392
00:29:48,901 --> 00:29:51,167
We just got back
from the Balkans.

393
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:52,767
What was the artifact
you found?

394
00:29:52,767 --> 00:29:55,200
A metal box.

395
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,567
An Ark.

396
00:29:56,567 --> 00:29:58,367
The Ark of Solon?

397
00:29:58,367 --> 00:30:00,367
Atticus thinks so.

398
00:30:00,367 --> 00:30:02,434
But that's incredible.

399
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:04,033
The Ark of Solon is like

400
00:30:04,033 --> 00:30:05,901
the Loch Ness Monster
of archaeology.

401
00:30:05,901 --> 00:30:08,133
People think it's a legend.

402
00:30:08,133 --> 00:30:10,767
Isn't it supposed to hold the
Torch of Truth from Atlantis?

403
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,133
Don't know.
We haven't opened it yet.

404
00:30:13,133 --> 00:30:15,734
This came off a scratch
on the side.

405
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,267
Can you analyze it for me,
please?

406
00:30:21,968 --> 00:30:23,968
Sure. I'll run some tests
in the lab.

407
00:30:23,968 --> 00:30:25,734
Thanks.

408
00:30:25,734 --> 00:30:27,767
Would you like to carry my books?

409
00:30:29,868 --> 00:30:31,200
Yeah, sure.

410
00:30:35,868 --> 00:30:37,601
What a madhouse.

411
00:30:37,601 --> 00:30:39,133
How do you stand the noise?

412
00:30:39,133 --> 00:30:40,667
This is the rush hour.

413
00:30:40,667 --> 00:30:42,767
You should be here
when it's really quiet.

414
00:30:42,767 --> 00:30:44,033
It's enough to drive you batty.

415
00:30:44,033 --> 00:30:46,968
Kelly!

416
00:30:46,968 --> 00:30:49,200
I'm so sorry
I missed your lecture.

417
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,300
It's impossible London traffic.

418
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,567
Hello, Simon.

419
00:30:53,567 --> 00:30:54,667
Oh, do you remember--?

420
00:30:54,667 --> 00:30:56,634
MacGyver.

421
00:30:56,634 --> 00:30:58,267
Professor Carson.

422
00:30:58,267 --> 00:31:00,367
You were at Thera
with that buffoon, Atticus.

423
00:31:00,367 --> 00:31:02,934
Nearly got yourselves killed,
poking around the ruins.

424
00:31:02,934 --> 00:31:06,601
MacGyver and Atticus have found
the Ark of Solon.

425
00:31:06,601 --> 00:31:07,734
Isn't that amazing?

426
00:31:07,734 --> 00:31:10,334
So Atticus is still hunting

427
00:31:10,334 --> 00:31:11,801
for the mythical Atlantis, is he?

428
00:31:11,801 --> 00:31:13,467
Heh.
The man will never learn.

429
00:31:13,467 --> 00:31:16,200
But if the Ark is genuine,
and the Torch is inside,

430
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,033
it's the greatest find
of the century.

431
00:31:19,033 --> 00:31:21,133
Where is this so-called Ark?

432
00:31:21,133 --> 00:31:22,968
The Royal Academy, sir.

433
00:31:22,968 --> 00:31:25,234
Well, I'll go and see for myself.

434
00:31:25,234 --> 00:31:27,133
We have to run some tests.

435
00:31:27,133 --> 00:31:29,367
I'll meet you
back at your hotel room.

436
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:30,834
Don't be long.

437
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:33,167
My flight back to Greece
leaves this afternoon.

438
00:31:34,634 --> 00:31:36,267
Nice talking to you.

439
00:31:36,267 --> 00:31:38,734
The years haven't mellowed him.

440
00:31:38,734 --> 00:31:40,834
No.

441
00:31:40,834 --> 00:31:42,267
That's my grandfather.

442
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:43,968
I thought he never left Greece.

443
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:45,801
I made the mistake
of telling him

444
00:31:45,801 --> 00:31:48,901
that the university
had offered me tenure.

445
00:31:48,901 --> 00:31:53,167
So he made a special trip
to talk me into accepting.

446
00:31:53,167 --> 00:31:56,934
According to Simon, staying at
the university will mature me,

447
00:31:56,934 --> 00:32:01,133
like I was a bottle of wine
or a wedge of cheese.

448
00:32:01,133 --> 00:32:04,067
What's with this "Simon" thing?

449
00:32:04,067 --> 00:32:06,100
He doesn't like
being called grandfather.

450
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,033
Says it makes him feel old.

451
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,434
Simon's planned my whole life.

452
00:32:13,434 --> 00:32:15,167
It's all right
for him to spend his time

453
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:16,734
digging in ancient ruins,

454
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,934
but I'm supposed to
stay at the university

455
00:32:18,934 --> 00:32:21,734
and have a solid career.

456
00:32:21,734 --> 00:32:25,834
Which, roughly translated,
means a safe career.

457
00:32:29,634 --> 00:32:31,868
Well, what do you want?

458
00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:33,367
A challenge.

459
00:32:35,467 --> 00:32:37,567
Right now teaching
is just repeating

460
00:32:37,567 --> 00:32:39,701
what I already know.

461
00:32:39,701 --> 00:32:41,634
I want to get out,

462
00:32:41,634 --> 00:32:42,968
see the world,

463
00:32:42,968 --> 00:32:45,801
learn new things.

464
00:32:45,801 --> 00:32:48,934
So get out. See the world.

465
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:51,334
Learn some new things.

466
00:32:51,334 --> 00:32:54,100
I don't want to disappoint Simon.

467
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,300
He raised me
after my parents died.

468
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,634
Helped me earn my Ph.D.

469
00:32:59,634 --> 00:33:02,367
And I owe him so much.

470
00:33:02,367 --> 00:33:04,334
But sometimes he can be so...

471
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,033
Demanding?

472
00:33:07,033 --> 00:33:08,834
Hm. More like tyrannical.

473
00:33:10,634 --> 00:33:13,000
Kelly...

474
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,667
It's your life.

475
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:17,000
It should be your decision.

476
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,734
I wish I had as much confidence
in me as you do.

477
00:33:19,734 --> 00:33:22,934
I shouldn't admit this,
but when we were in Thera,

478
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:24,434
I had the most awful crush
on you.

479
00:33:26,267 --> 00:33:28,467
Me? Really?

480
00:33:29,734 --> 00:33:31,467
Perfect timing.

481
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,300
That's odd.
What?

482
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:41,367
Well, the Ark of Solon was made
around the 6th Century B.C.,

483
00:33:41,367 --> 00:33:44,667
in Athens during the Iron Age.

484
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:47,267
But according to this,
the tool that dented it

485
00:33:47,267 --> 00:33:48,367
was made from tin,

486
00:33:48,367 --> 00:33:50,934
and judging
by these trace elements,

487
00:33:50,934 --> 00:33:54,834
it came from the mines in
Cornwall during pre-Roman times.

488
00:33:54,834 --> 00:33:57,033
Cornwall?

489
00:33:57,033 --> 00:33:58,734
Isn't that near Exeter?

490
00:33:58,734 --> 00:34:00,467
Yes.

491
00:34:00,467 --> 00:34:04,200
Why, does it mean something?

492
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,767
I'd better get to the academy.

493
00:34:05,767 --> 00:34:06,767
May I go with you?

494
00:34:09,734 --> 00:34:11,300
Yeah.

495
00:34:18,701 --> 00:34:20,667
So why do you think
your grandfather's

496
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:23,567
so hostile about Atlantis?

497
00:34:23,567 --> 00:34:25,267
If Atlantis was real,

498
00:34:25,267 --> 00:34:28,267
it would mean rewriting
the history books.

499
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:29,968
I thought that was
an archaeologist's job,

500
00:34:29,968 --> 00:34:32,167
to rewrite history.

501
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:34,968
I guess some people
are frightened of change.

502
00:34:56,868 --> 00:34:58,300
Yes?

503
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,133
MacGyver and Miss Carson
have arrived.

504
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:02,200
They're about to open the Ark.

505
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,167
Good.

506
00:35:04,167 --> 00:35:05,701
You know what to do.

507
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,701
"Atlantis anaduotai."

508
00:35:10,701 --> 00:35:12,367
"Atlantis rises."

509
00:35:14,834 --> 00:35:18,067
The words on the medallion
and the Ark are identical.

510
00:35:18,067 --> 00:35:19,567
Coincidence.

511
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:21,601
You can't expect us
to believe these two artifacts

512
00:35:21,601 --> 00:35:24,033
are in any way connected.

513
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,100
"The gods march in rank,

514
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,868
"and Hecate races
in the heavens.

515
00:35:30,868 --> 00:35:33,200
"Enter the gates of Hades,

516
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,400
"and the Book shall summon
the power of the ancient ones.

517
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,901
Offer the Torch of Truth
to the Temple of Ages--"

518
00:35:39,901 --> 00:35:42,000
"And the Treasure
of Atlantis shall rise."

519
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,501
I've seen this riddle
in the caves at Exeter,

520
00:35:44,501 --> 00:35:49,067
carved on an altar
by the Cult of Solon.

521
00:35:49,067 --> 00:35:51,934
So the gods are these figures
on the side here?

522
00:35:51,934 --> 00:35:53,434
Yes.

523
00:35:53,434 --> 00:35:56,901
Hermes, Aphrodite,
Gaea, Selene,

524
00:35:56,901 --> 00:36:00,801
Ares, Zeus and Cronus.

525
00:36:00,801 --> 00:36:03,067
This little guy on top, um,

526
00:36:03,067 --> 00:36:04,100
how do you pronounce it?

527
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,234
Hecate.

528
00:36:05,234 --> 00:36:07,567
Demon of the night.

529
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:09,434
According to ancient legend,

530
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:12,300
she was an omen of disaster
and death.

531
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,400
I'm convinced that these
are really instructions

532
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,133
written by Solon to help find
the Treasure of Atlantis.

533
00:36:18,133 --> 00:36:20,200
Addle-minded bunk.

534
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,200
The legend of Atlantis
is just that, a legend.

535
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,234
I can prove it existed.

536
00:36:25,234 --> 00:36:29,133
Now, inside this Ark
is a relic of Atlantis itself.

537
00:36:29,133 --> 00:36:31,133
The Torch of Truth.

538
00:36:31,133 --> 00:36:32,801
Where is the director
with his key

539
00:36:32,801 --> 00:36:34,534
to open the blasted
display case?

540
00:36:34,534 --> 00:36:35,968
Uh, professor,

541
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:38,467
Kelly discovered something
you might want to--

542
00:36:38,467 --> 00:36:39,801
Professor Atticus.

543
00:36:41,267 --> 00:36:44,100
I've just been on the phone
to the Balkan Embassy.

544
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,868
They say that you
and Mr. MacGyver are thieves.

545
00:36:46,868 --> 00:36:48,734
Oh, do you hear that, MacGyver?

546
00:36:48,734 --> 00:36:48,801
First we are spies,
now we are thieves.

547
00:36:51,367 --> 00:36:53,701
They claim the Ark
is a national treasure,

548
00:36:53,701 --> 00:36:55,501
and demand its return.

549
00:36:55,501 --> 00:36:57,400
You can't return it
to those butchers.

550
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,234
It belongs to the world.

551
00:36:59,234 --> 00:37:01,667
You have no say in the matter.

552
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:03,501
I'll remind you,
Professor Atticus,

553
00:37:03,501 --> 00:37:04,801
that you no longer work here.

554
00:37:04,801 --> 00:37:07,734
Oh, Mr. Director,

555
00:37:07,734 --> 00:37:11,901
this Ark contains
the missing link to Atlantis,

556
00:37:11,901 --> 00:37:14,067
an unknown chapter in history.

557
00:37:14,067 --> 00:37:16,601
If you'll just
open the display case

558
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:19,734
and let us get hold
of that medallion.

559
00:37:28,968 --> 00:37:30,968
Excuse me, can I see that?

560
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,467
The medallion's magnetic.

561
00:37:42,467 --> 00:37:44,334
Yeah, so's the Ark.

562
00:37:44,334 --> 00:37:46,901
A magnetic lock and key.

563
00:37:46,901 --> 00:37:49,667
Impossible.
The people of Solon's time

564
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:51,734
had no concept
of the physics of magnetism.

565
00:37:51,734 --> 00:37:54,734
Ah, but legend says
the people of Atlantis did,

566
00:37:54,734 --> 00:37:57,000
and Solon somehow must have
learned it from them.

567
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,901
Pure speculation.

568
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,400
Ha-ha-ha!
You won't think so

569
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,167
when you see
what's inside this Ark.

570
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:04,200
That's it, this is it.
This is it.

571
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:16,067
It works.
It works, it works.

572
00:38:16,067 --> 00:38:18,601
Oh, after all
these years, MacGyver.

573
00:38:18,601 --> 00:38:20,267
Ha-ha-ha!
At long last.

574
00:38:23,033 --> 00:38:26,701
The Torch of Truth.

575
00:38:37,934 --> 00:38:41,300
I... I don't understand.

576
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,534
I knew this was a waste of time.

577
00:38:43,534 --> 00:38:45,334
But the Torch must be in here.

578
00:38:45,334 --> 00:38:47,834
It isn't, because it never existed.

579
00:38:47,834 --> 00:38:52,200
The Torch is a myth,
like Atlantis.

580
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,734
But the medallion
did open the Ark.

581
00:38:54,734 --> 00:38:56,634
If that much
of the legend is true,

582
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,767
maybe the rest is too.

583
00:38:58,767 --> 00:39:01,734
Look, if I could
take the Ark to Thera

584
00:39:01,734 --> 00:39:03,067
and solve the riddle of Solon,

585
00:39:03,067 --> 00:39:07,434
uh, I know that I could prove
that the ruined city there

586
00:39:07,434 --> 00:39:10,868
was Atlantis and find the treasure.

587
00:39:10,868 --> 00:39:14,267
You and MacGyver caused enough
trouble on Thera five years ago.

588
00:39:14,267 --> 00:39:17,567
Simon, you told me the best tool
an archaeologist has

589
00:39:17,567 --> 00:39:19,801
is an open mind.

590
00:39:19,801 --> 00:39:23,067
I won't have my work
disrupted again by Atticus

591
00:39:23,067 --> 00:39:26,334
and his idiotic notions
about a super-civilization.

592
00:39:26,334 --> 00:39:28,734
Simon, you are still
a blinkered old fool!

593
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:30,200
I have no time for this.

594
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,834
I have a plane to catch
back to Greece.

595
00:39:32,834 --> 00:39:34,467
Come along, Kelly,

596
00:39:34,467 --> 00:39:36,000
I'll give you a ride
to the university.

597
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,434
I'm not going back there, Simon.

598
00:39:39,434 --> 00:39:42,000
What are you saying?

599
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,133
I've decided
I'd like to stay here

600
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:46,634
and work with Atticus and MacGyver.

601
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:50,000
Kelly, you're a scholar, girl,

602
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,234
not a treasure hunter.

603
00:39:52,234 --> 00:39:55,501
All my life,
I've done what you want.

604
00:39:55,501 --> 00:39:58,300
I'm quite capable
of making up my own mind.

605
00:40:00,133 --> 00:40:03,367
First you and MacGyver
disrupted my work on Thera,

606
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:05,934
and now you've poisoned
my granddaughter's mind.

607
00:40:05,934 --> 00:40:07,501
No.

608
00:40:07,501 --> 00:40:09,534
It's my decision.

609
00:40:09,534 --> 00:40:12,467
Fine. Go ahead.

610
00:40:12,467 --> 00:40:14,767
Throw away your academic career,
if you want.

611
00:40:14,767 --> 00:40:18,634
When you regain your senses,
let me know.

612
00:40:18,634 --> 00:40:21,467
I'm going back to Thera,
which I'm telling you

613
00:40:21,467 --> 00:40:25,467
for the last time,
is not Atlantis,

614
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:28,968
because Atlantis never existed.

615
00:40:31,801 --> 00:40:35,567
The Ark will be returned
to the Balkans immediately.

616
00:40:35,567 --> 00:40:37,133
Meanwhile, I'd appreciate it

617
00:40:37,133 --> 00:40:39,734
if you'd clear out
your former office,

618
00:40:39,734 --> 00:40:42,601
and remove yourself
from the premises.

619
00:40:43,968 --> 00:40:45,567
Professor.

620
00:40:45,567 --> 00:40:46,567
Come on.

621
00:40:52,968 --> 00:40:57,200
Why wasn't the Torch in the Ark?

622
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,801
Well, it probably was at one time.

623
00:41:00,801 --> 00:41:02,434
You said the Cult of Solon

624
00:41:02,434 --> 00:41:05,367
lived in some caves
near Exeter, right?

625
00:41:05,367 --> 00:41:06,968
Of course.

626
00:41:06,968 --> 00:41:10,501
That cut in the Ark was made
by a tool forged near there.

627
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:14,133
You mean the cult opened the Ark
and removed the Torch?

628
00:41:37,033 --> 00:41:38,834
Call the police.

629
00:41:49,968 --> 00:41:50,801
Hey!

630
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:27,634
A man planted on the inside
fires a tranquilizer dart,

631
00:44:27,634 --> 00:44:31,133
escapes in a dummy cab
to a waiting speedboat.

632
00:44:31,133 --> 00:44:33,934
I think we can safely say this
was no ordinary smash and grab.

633
00:44:33,934 --> 00:44:36,300
No, this was planned
like a military operation.

634
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,167
Isn't that an awful lot
of trouble to go through

635
00:44:38,167 --> 00:44:39,767
to steal artifacts?

636
00:44:39,767 --> 00:44:41,567
The Ark and the medallion

637
00:44:41,567 --> 00:44:43,100
would sell for millions
on the black market.

638
00:44:45,234 --> 00:44:46,901
Inspector Rhodes,
this just came in.

639
00:44:46,901 --> 00:44:48,334
Thank you.

640
00:44:48,334 --> 00:44:52,434
Now, we ran your description
of the thief through Interpol.

641
00:44:52,434 --> 00:44:53,634
Is this the man?

642
00:44:53,634 --> 00:44:56,234
No, I-- I didn't get
a good look at him.

643
00:44:56,234 --> 00:44:57,234
I did.

644
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,701
That's the guy.

645
00:45:00,701 --> 00:45:02,567
Yannis Zavros.

646
00:45:02,567 --> 00:45:03,901
A general in the Greek army,

647
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:05,767
until he was court-martialed.

648
00:45:05,767 --> 00:45:07,601
For what?

649
00:45:07,601 --> 00:45:10,434
He's the leader
of a militant group of fanatics

650
00:45:10,434 --> 00:45:12,868
who claim Macedonia
as their birthright.

651
00:45:12,868 --> 00:45:16,033
They see themselves as the heirs
of Alexander the Great.

652
00:45:17,567 --> 00:45:19,968
And why would
he want artifacts?

653
00:45:19,968 --> 00:45:22,167
We suspect
he's been funding his cause

654
00:45:22,167 --> 00:45:25,834
by selling stolen relics on
the international black market.

655
00:45:25,834 --> 00:45:28,200
His known associate
is Cyril Cleeve.

656
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:28,868
Cleeve?!

657
00:45:30,334 --> 00:45:31,467
What? You know him?

658
00:45:31,467 --> 00:45:33,067
I'm afraid I do.

659
00:45:33,067 --> 00:45:35,367
He was a student of mine,
a few years after you.

660
00:45:35,367 --> 00:45:38,968
He had no interest in history,
only in hunting treasure.

661
00:45:38,968 --> 00:45:41,133
He's Lord Cleeve now.
He bought the title,

662
00:45:41,133 --> 00:45:43,367
along with an estate
in Plymouth.

663
00:45:43,367 --> 00:45:44,868
Rather more
respectable image

664
00:45:44,868 --> 00:45:47,300
than the godfather
of artifact smugglers.

665
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,033
So why don't you
just arrest him?

666
00:45:49,033 --> 00:45:51,234
We have no evidence.

667
00:45:51,234 --> 00:45:53,834
Cleeve's always very careful
to layer himself.

668
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,534
He always uses a middleman

669
00:45:55,534 --> 00:45:57,400
or a stooge
to do the dirty work.

670
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,033
By now he's probably smuggled
the Ark and the medallion

671
00:46:00,033 --> 00:46:02,667
out of the country and locked in
some private collector's vault

672
00:46:02,667 --> 00:46:04,234
where we'll never find them.

673
00:46:04,234 --> 00:46:05,834
I had no idea that trading
on artifacts

674
00:46:05,834 --> 00:46:07,234
had become such a problem.

675
00:46:07,234 --> 00:46:10,133
The international trade in
stolen antiquities and fine art

676
00:46:10,133 --> 00:46:13,801
is very big business,
second only to narcotics.

677
00:46:13,801 --> 00:46:17,000
We just don't have the manpower
to stop every smuggler,

678
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,067
especially a major player
like Cleeve.

679
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:21,701
So, what, he gets off,
just like that?

680
00:46:21,701 --> 00:46:23,400
Look, I don't like it
anymore than you do.

681
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,801
I do what I can,

682
00:46:24,801 --> 00:46:28,067
but I gave up expecting miracles
a long time ago.

683
00:46:34,801 --> 00:46:36,968
All right, professor,
what's going on?

684
00:46:36,968 --> 00:46:39,033
MacGyver, what are you doing?

685
00:46:41,067 --> 00:46:43,067
You heard Inspector Rhodes.

686
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:45,234
He said both the artifacts
were missing.

687
00:46:45,234 --> 00:46:46,801
When I tried to stop
that little--

688
00:46:46,801 --> 00:46:50,067
That Zavros, I saw him
drop the medallion.

689
00:46:50,067 --> 00:46:51,534
Now, where is it?

690
00:46:52,567 --> 00:46:54,067
Where is it?!

691
00:46:54,067 --> 00:46:56,834
I hid it in my office
before the police came.

692
00:46:56,834 --> 00:46:58,634
You stole
the medallion?

693
00:46:58,634 --> 00:47:00,467
Oh, purely for safekeeping.

694
00:47:00,467 --> 00:47:01,534
Why?

695
00:47:01,534 --> 00:47:02,801
I had no choice,
MacGyver.

696
00:47:02,801 --> 00:47:05,033
You don't realize
what's at stake.

697
00:47:05,033 --> 00:47:07,601
I'd say about 20 years...

698
00:47:07,601 --> 00:47:08,801
for robbery.

699
00:47:08,801 --> 00:47:10,234
I can explain
everything.

700
00:47:10,234 --> 00:47:11,634
My office is this way.

701
00:47:15,367 --> 00:47:16,734
Come on. In you come.

702
00:47:20,968 --> 00:47:23,667
It's been torn apart.

703
00:47:23,667 --> 00:47:25,234
All right, don't touch anything.

704
00:47:25,234 --> 00:47:26,634
I'll call the police.

705
00:47:26,634 --> 00:47:29,033
Nonsense, this is how
it always looks!

706
00:47:29,033 --> 00:47:32,400
A neat office is the product
of an empty mind!

707
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,033
Professor?

708
00:47:35,033 --> 00:47:37,334
Just a moment, MacGyver.

709
00:47:37,334 --> 00:47:39,868
Hold your horses.

710
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,501
Ah. There we are, safe and sound.

711
00:47:44,501 --> 00:47:46,667
Just as I promised.

712
00:47:46,667 --> 00:47:49,300
Now, what's going on?

713
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:52,834
Ah, yes, well, that requires
some explaining.

714
00:47:52,834 --> 00:47:53,868
Yes.

715
00:47:53,868 --> 00:47:55,601
We are here.

716
00:47:55,601 --> 00:47:58,601
You said the riddle on the Ark
was a set of instructions?

717
00:47:58,601 --> 00:48:01,167
Exactly. And if, uh,
Cleeve stole the Ark,

718
00:48:01,167 --> 00:48:04,167
it can only mean
that he's after the treasure!

719
00:48:04,167 --> 00:48:06,300
Is there some reason you cou--?

720
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,200
Is there some reason

721
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,000
you couldn't have told
the police that?

722
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,901
You heard Rhodes.
He's got his hands full.

723
00:48:11,901 --> 00:48:14,767
Besides, we're running out
of time as it is.

724
00:48:14,767 --> 00:48:16,934
Now, now. Where's--?
Where's my journal?

725
00:48:16,934 --> 00:48:18,634
D-d-don't...

726
00:48:18,634 --> 00:48:21,033
Don't, uh--
Don't touch...

727
00:48:23,334 --> 00:48:24,567
anything.

728
00:48:24,567 --> 00:48:27,033
What do you mean,
we're running out of time?

729
00:48:27,033 --> 00:48:28,100
That's right.

730
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,267
In fact,
we've only got two days

731
00:48:30,267 --> 00:48:31,501
to find the treasure.

732
00:48:31,501 --> 00:48:34,534
I can't even find my journal.

733
00:48:34,534 --> 00:48:35,868
Why only two days?

734
00:48:37,901 --> 00:48:39,400
Ah! Ha.

735
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,701
Success.

736
00:48:40,701 --> 00:48:42,701
Professor, why only two days?

737
00:48:42,701 --> 00:48:44,100
Because that is when

738
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:47,367
the first line of Solon's riddle
comes true.

739
00:48:47,367 --> 00:48:49,133
I copied it, uh--

740
00:48:49,133 --> 00:48:51,167
Uh, from an altar I found in--

741
00:48:51,167 --> 00:48:53,033
In the caves at Exeter.
Where is it?

742
00:48:54,701 --> 00:48:56,834
Hm. There we are.
There you are.

743
00:48:56,834 --> 00:48:59,868
"When the gods march in rank."

744
00:48:59,868 --> 00:49:01,601
What does it mean?

745
00:49:01,601 --> 00:49:03,634
Well, you saw the carvings
on the Ark.

746
00:49:03,634 --> 00:49:04,767
Now,
as you know--

747
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:06,567
I mean, when the Romans adopted
the Greek gods,

748
00:49:06,567 --> 00:49:08,200
they gave them new names.

749
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,801
Now, let's see, uh,

750
00:49:09,801 --> 00:49:13,133
Hermes became Mercury.

751
00:49:13,133 --> 00:49:15,434
Aphrodite, Venus.

752
00:49:15,434 --> 00:49:16,801
Gaea, the Earth.

753
00:49:16,801 --> 00:49:20,400
And Selene became Luna,
the moon.

754
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,334
Ares, Mars.
Zeus, Jupiter.

755
00:49:23,334 --> 00:49:25,734
And Cronus, Saturn.

756
00:49:25,734 --> 00:49:27,367
"The gods march in rank."

757
00:49:27,367 --> 00:49:28,467
Exactly.

758
00:49:29,767 --> 00:49:32,567
Now, according
to Royal Observatory records,

759
00:49:32,567 --> 00:49:35,434
uh, this orbital alignment
happens only once

760
00:49:35,434 --> 00:49:37,467
every five hundred years.

761
00:49:37,467 --> 00:49:40,100
And it will next take place
in two days.

762
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:42,968
And that, I mean, if we are
to believe Solon's riddle,

763
00:49:42,968 --> 00:49:47,234
is when the Treasure
of Atlantis rises.

764
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,501
But where is the treasure?

765
00:49:49,501 --> 00:49:51,100
Well, legend says
that it's hidden

766
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:52,801
in the Tower of Fear.

767
00:49:52,801 --> 00:49:57,000
And, uh, the Greek word
for "fear" of course, is, uh...

768
00:49:58,801 --> 00:50:00,701
...Thera.

769
00:50:00,701 --> 00:50:02,300
Uh, where's the picture?
There-- There--

770
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,601
There was a picture.
The picture.

771
00:50:03,601 --> 00:50:04,667
Where's the picture?

772
00:50:04,667 --> 00:50:06,133
Yes. I'll show you.

773
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,501
Ah, here we are.

774
00:50:10,501 --> 00:50:11,767
Yes, here we are.
That's it.

775
00:50:11,767 --> 00:50:13,934
And there I am, MacGyver.

776
00:50:13,934 --> 00:50:16,200
There I am
with your grandfather,

777
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,267
and there is the Tower.

778
00:50:18,267 --> 00:50:21,734
Professor, you know
that volcano is still active.

779
00:50:21,734 --> 00:50:23,300
Yes, I know.

780
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:24,801
But there are ruins
near the crater.

781
00:50:24,801 --> 00:50:26,501
Simon took me there once.

782
00:50:26,501 --> 00:50:27,501
That's right.

783
00:50:27,501 --> 00:50:29,400
And in two days,
when the planets align,

784
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,067
we must offer up
the Torch of Truth

785
00:50:32,067 --> 00:50:33,200
to the Temple of Ages

786
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,834
and reveal the treasure.

787
00:50:34,834 --> 00:50:38,133
And that is why it is essential
we find the--

788
00:50:38,133 --> 00:50:39,934
The Torch.

789
00:50:39,934 --> 00:50:42,267
But if the cult took the Torch
from the Ark,

790
00:50:42,267 --> 00:50:43,701
where did they put it?

791
00:50:43,701 --> 00:50:48,100
Well, they probably hid it
in the safest place they knew.

792
00:51:00,501 --> 00:51:02,334
The caves of Exeter.

793
00:51:13,334 --> 00:51:16,033
The cult made
these paintings of Atlantis

794
00:51:16,033 --> 00:51:20,767
based on descriptions
from the platinum book itself.

795
00:51:20,767 --> 00:51:22,501
It must have been paradise.

796
00:51:22,501 --> 00:51:23,801
Yes.

797
00:51:23,801 --> 00:51:25,601
Torch of Truth, I presume.

798
00:51:25,601 --> 00:51:27,267
Yes, that's right. Yes.

799
00:51:27,267 --> 00:51:28,767
It doesn't tell us much.

800
00:51:28,767 --> 00:51:29,901
What does it look like?

801
00:51:29,901 --> 00:51:31,567
Well, nobody knows
exactly.

802
00:51:31,567 --> 00:51:34,267
I mean, these are the only
visual representations

803
00:51:34,267 --> 00:51:35,901
that I've seen.

804
00:51:35,901 --> 00:51:38,133
Well, how can we find
the Torch

805
00:51:38,133 --> 00:51:39,601
if we don't know
what it looks like?

806
00:51:39,601 --> 00:51:42,100
Well, Solon says that
it's the mirror of the world,

807
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:44,968
reflecting the past,
present, and future.

808
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,100
Professor, you said the cult
was driven out by the Romans.

809
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,501
Yes, the ones that weren't killed

810
00:51:53,501 --> 00:51:54,801
uh, fled with the Ark.

811
00:51:54,801 --> 00:51:56,267
But they thought Solon
was coming back

812
00:51:56,267 --> 00:51:57,367
for the Torch someday.

813
00:51:57,367 --> 00:51:58,901
Yes, that's right.
That's right, yes.

814
00:51:58,901 --> 00:52:00,634
Well, maybe they hid it
where they figured

815
00:52:00,634 --> 00:52:01,968
only he could find it.

816
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:05,434
Maybe.

817
00:52:07,534 --> 00:52:09,834
Is this the same writing
that's on the Ark?

818
00:52:09,834 --> 00:52:12,901
Yes, yes, this is the, uh,
riddle of Solon.

819
00:52:12,901 --> 00:52:15,234
These streaks look like rust.

820
00:52:18,334 --> 00:52:19,734
Iron ore.

821
00:52:19,734 --> 00:52:21,467
The altar's magnetic.

822
00:52:21,467 --> 00:52:22,667
Let's check it out.

823
00:52:30,734 --> 00:52:33,033
Wow. I guess.

824
00:52:34,767 --> 00:52:37,200
Professor, let's see the medallion.

825
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,901
Have you got an idea, MacGyver?

826
00:52:38,901 --> 00:52:41,534
Well, if the cult took the Torch
out of the Ark,

827
00:52:41,534 --> 00:52:44,467
maybe they built a bigger,
better one.

828
00:52:44,467 --> 00:52:45,801
But where is it?

829
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,000
I think we're in it.

830
00:52:51,734 --> 00:52:53,234
Are you suggesting

831
00:52:53,234 --> 00:52:56,367
that this entire chamber
is a giant Ark?

832
00:52:58,167 --> 00:52:59,534
This could be the key.

833
00:52:59,534 --> 00:53:01,334
Then we need to find a keyhole.

834
00:53:01,334 --> 00:53:04,701
Maybe not.

835
00:53:56,601 --> 00:53:58,100
The Torch of Truth.

836
00:54:03,601 --> 00:54:05,567
It's more magnificent

837
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:08,934
than I ever imagined.

838
00:54:08,934 --> 00:54:10,767
Wait a minute.

839
00:54:10,767 --> 00:54:12,200
Just wait.

840
00:54:33,534 --> 00:54:35,033
I guess it's all right.

841
00:54:35,033 --> 00:54:36,367
You're wrong.

842
00:54:36,367 --> 00:54:38,901
These caves are full
of unpleasant surprises,

843
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:39,868
I'm afraid.

844
00:54:41,367 --> 00:54:43,734
Lord Cleeve, at your service.

845
00:54:43,734 --> 00:54:46,501
I owe you a debt of thanks,
Mr. MacGyver.

846
00:54:46,501 --> 00:54:48,567
And you too, Miss Carson.

847
00:54:48,567 --> 00:54:50,968
Now, if you'd mind

848
00:54:50,968 --> 00:54:52,968
just handing over the Torch
to my partner.

849
00:54:58,801 --> 00:55:00,300
Partner?

850
00:55:02,534 --> 00:55:05,200
I'm truly sorry, MacGyver.

851
00:55:23,868 --> 00:55:26,901
I don't like this, Cleeve.
You promised not to hurt them.

852
00:55:26,901 --> 00:55:28,200
I wouldn't dream of it,

853
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,567
but we can hardly have them
following us, now can we?

854
00:55:30,567 --> 00:55:33,133
I trusted you.

855
00:55:33,133 --> 00:55:36,033
How can you do this, Atticus?
You're not a criminal.

856
00:55:36,033 --> 00:55:38,033
We have what we came for.

857
00:55:38,033 --> 00:55:39,834
Let's get out of here.

858
00:55:39,834 --> 00:55:41,634
General Zavros has a point.

859
00:55:41,634 --> 00:55:43,133
Let's go, professor.

860
00:55:43,133 --> 00:55:45,567
The Treasure of Atlantis awaits.

861
00:55:55,467 --> 00:55:57,834
Lord Cleeve is right.

862
00:55:57,834 --> 00:56:00,267
We cannot afford
to have you follow us.

863
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:13,567
Oh, MacGyver!

864
00:56:18,767 --> 00:56:20,901
Kelly, try to get this rope
over your head.

865
00:56:20,901 --> 00:56:22,367
Come on.

866
00:56:32,501 --> 00:56:33,734
Ohhh!
Come on.

867
00:56:39,667 --> 00:56:40,567
Oh!

868
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:08,934
You okay?

869
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,734
I can't believe Atticus
would do that.

870
00:57:15,734 --> 00:57:17,100
Oh.

871
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,100
His passion, Cleeve's greed.

872
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,767
It makes sense.

873
00:57:20,767 --> 00:57:22,601
I'm sorry.

874
00:57:22,601 --> 00:57:24,634
I know you looked up to him.

875
00:57:24,634 --> 00:57:26,567
Used to.

876
00:57:26,567 --> 00:57:29,601
We did exactly
what Cleeve wanted us to.

877
00:57:29,601 --> 00:57:30,934
Now he and Zavros
are going to steal

878
00:57:30,934 --> 00:57:32,033
the Treasure of Atlantis,

879
00:57:32,033 --> 00:57:33,634
thanks to us.

880
00:57:33,634 --> 00:57:36,167
Maybe not.

881
00:57:36,167 --> 00:57:38,167
Cleeve's estate.

882
00:57:38,167 --> 00:57:40,868
Let's find it.

883
00:58:06,934 --> 00:58:09,767
Kind of looks like
they're planning a trip.

884
00:58:09,767 --> 00:58:12,033
We can't let them take off
with the artifacts.

885
00:58:12,033 --> 00:58:13,634
I know.

886
00:58:17,934 --> 00:58:19,300
Wait here.

887
00:59:30,367 --> 00:59:32,834
Just look at it.

888
00:59:32,834 --> 00:59:38,000
Unlike anything the world
has seen in thousands of years.

889
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,100
It is truly magnificent.

890
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:45,300
Probably the finest item
I'll ever acquire.

891
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:46,601
It should fetch millions.

892
00:59:46,601 --> 00:59:48,968
Money?

893
00:59:48,968 --> 00:59:51,467
Is that all that it means to you?

894
00:59:53,033 --> 00:59:55,267
Money bought me my title.

895
00:59:55,267 --> 00:59:57,901
This estate.

896
00:59:57,901 --> 01:00:00,467
And now it'll help me
go down in history

897
01:00:00,467 --> 01:00:04,133
as the discoverer
of the Treasure of Atlantis.

898
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:06,734
Sorry, co-discoverer.

899
01:00:06,734 --> 01:00:10,300
You think you can buy your way
into the history books?

900
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:11,734
I wouldn't be the first.

901
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:43,267
Come in.

902
01:00:43,267 --> 01:00:45,033
Anybody.
Answer me, please?

903
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,000
Come in, this is an emergency.

904
01:00:50,767 --> 01:00:52,467
Have a sherry to celebrate.

905
01:00:52,467 --> 01:00:54,033
I may be forced to work with you,

906
01:00:54,033 --> 01:00:55,901
but don't expect me to enjoy it.

907
01:00:55,901 --> 01:00:58,200
Please, professor,

908
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,834
spare me the hypocrisy.

909
01:01:01,234 --> 01:01:03,267
You and I are two of a kind.

910
01:01:03,267 --> 01:01:05,601
Now, Zavros,
he only wants the money

911
01:01:05,601 --> 01:01:08,000
to fund his little revolution
in Macedonia.

912
01:01:10,634 --> 01:01:12,634
But you and I share
the same dream,

913
01:01:12,634 --> 01:01:14,667
to find the Treasure of Atlantis,

914
01:01:14,667 --> 01:01:18,901
no matter what it takes,
or what the cost.

915
01:01:18,901 --> 01:01:19,868
Go on.

916
01:01:22,234 --> 01:01:23,467
Kelly.

917
01:01:23,467 --> 01:01:24,234
Miss Carson.

918
01:01:45,234 --> 01:01:47,767
Hey, now, there's no need
to be rough with her.

919
01:01:47,767 --> 01:01:49,067
If she's here,

920
01:01:49,067 --> 01:01:50,334
so is MacGyver.

921
01:01:50,334 --> 01:01:52,834
General Zavros is right.

922
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:54,567
Where is MacGyver?

923
01:01:54,567 --> 01:01:56,734
Answer him.

924
01:02:43,367 --> 01:02:45,133
Tell us where MacGyver is.

925
01:02:45,133 --> 01:02:47,934
I'm not going
to tell you anything.

926
01:02:47,934 --> 01:02:51,267
Kelly, I-I do think
you should answer them.

927
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:53,834
I don't betray my friends.

928
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,234
I'll make her talk.

929
01:03:02,567 --> 01:03:04,467
Hold it!

930
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,801
Ah, Mr. MacGyver,
we've been expecting you.

931
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:15,834
You should know
your partner here

932
01:03:15,834 --> 01:03:16,968
tried to kill us.

933
01:03:16,968 --> 01:03:18,968
Cleeve! Is this true?

934
01:03:18,968 --> 01:03:20,567
Don't be naive.

935
01:03:20,567 --> 01:03:22,400
Did you really think
I'd leave them to follow us

936
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,767
or call the police?

937
01:03:23,767 --> 01:03:25,200
Good thinking.

938
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,868
We didn't come alone.

939
01:03:26,868 --> 01:03:28,434
Oh, come on.

940
01:03:28,434 --> 01:03:30,567
You don't think I'm gonna fall
for an old trick like that?

941
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:42,000
No!

942
01:03:46,033 --> 01:03:48,067
Yeah, sure,
now who's side are you on?

943
01:03:48,067 --> 01:03:49,734
Yours.
Can we discuss it later?

944
01:03:49,734 --> 01:03:51,100
He's got a point, MacGyver.
Come on.

945
01:03:54,234 --> 01:03:55,400
Which way?

946
01:03:57,734 --> 01:03:59,567
The plane.

947
01:03:59,567 --> 01:04:01,234
Oh, MacGyver...

948
01:04:08,267 --> 01:04:10,434
Uh, MacGyver.

949
01:04:12,133 --> 01:04:13,667
There's something
I've got to tell you.

950
01:04:13,667 --> 01:04:15,067
Later. Get in.

951
01:04:15,067 --> 01:04:16,434
Um...

952
01:04:19,234 --> 01:04:20,400
The window!

953
01:04:24,167 --> 01:04:26,367
There's no key
for the magneto switch.

954
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,834
That was what
I was trying to tell you.

955
01:04:27,834 --> 01:04:29,067
I removed it

956
01:04:29,067 --> 01:04:30,834
so they couldn't take off
with the artifacts.

957
01:04:30,834 --> 01:04:32,234
That's a great idea.
Where is it?

958
01:04:32,234 --> 01:04:34,367
Out there.

959
01:04:34,367 --> 01:04:35,734
That's a bad idea.

960
01:04:53,701 --> 01:04:55,400
They're getting away!

961
01:05:25,968 --> 01:05:27,200
That was close.

962
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,434
Bravo.
Well done, MacGyver.

963
01:05:29,434 --> 01:05:31,100
I knew you'd get us
out of that mess.

964
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:33,534
I always said
you're my brightest student.

965
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:39,434
I'm sorry.

966
01:05:39,434 --> 01:05:41,400
You've every right
to be angry with me.

967
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,734
I was wrong.

968
01:05:42,734 --> 01:05:45,367
I was foolish to think
that I could control Cleeve.

969
01:05:45,367 --> 01:05:47,267
You almost got us killed!

970
01:05:47,267 --> 01:05:49,734
You must believe me.

971
01:05:49,734 --> 01:05:53,234
I never meant any harm
to come to you or Kelly.

972
01:05:53,234 --> 01:05:56,300
The truth is, I was frightened.

973
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:58,133
I'd lost my position
at the academy.

974
01:05:58,133 --> 01:05:59,534
I was desperate.

975
01:05:59,534 --> 01:06:01,534
I mean, this is my last chance.

976
01:06:01,534 --> 01:06:03,300
I couldn't bear the thought
of losing it.

977
01:06:04,801 --> 01:06:07,234
I thought you hated
treasure hunters like Cleeve.

978
01:06:07,234 --> 01:06:08,300
I do.

979
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:09,801
But finding
the Treasure of Atlantis

980
01:06:09,801 --> 01:06:11,501
means more than wealth.

981
01:06:11,501 --> 01:06:15,000
It would prove
that Atlantis really did exist

982
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,534
and there were times

983
01:06:16,534 --> 01:06:19,901
when people didn't live
by war and conquest,

984
01:06:19,901 --> 01:06:21,234
but worshiped peace

985
01:06:21,234 --> 01:06:23,033
and knowledge.

986
01:06:23,033 --> 01:06:25,033
And if we were like that once,

987
01:06:25,033 --> 01:06:27,667
maybe we can be like that again.

988
01:06:27,667 --> 01:06:29,534
It's a nice dream.

989
01:06:29,534 --> 01:06:33,534
I'm convinced
that it can become a reality.

990
01:06:33,534 --> 01:06:36,000
It's a wonderful dream,
professor.

991
01:06:37,467 --> 01:06:39,167
But did it ever occur to you

992
01:06:39,167 --> 01:06:42,634
that Cleeve might have
other plans for the treasure?

993
01:06:42,634 --> 01:06:44,968
Do you think he and Zavros
will come after us?

994
01:06:47,534 --> 01:06:48,834
Yes.

995
01:06:48,834 --> 01:06:51,868
Yes, I do.

996
01:07:13,701 --> 01:07:16,267
The Tower of Fear.

997
01:07:16,267 --> 01:07:18,968
The Treasure of Atlantis
lies somewhere

998
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:21,300
in that crater.

999
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:23,300
Looks inviting.

1000
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:25,167
The last time
they had a major eruption,

1001
01:07:25,167 --> 01:07:28,400
it destroyed half the island,
along with Atlantis.

1002
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,868
Beautiful.

1003
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,367
Simon?

1004
01:07:55,834 --> 01:07:58,000
Simon!

1005
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,434
Oh, God, no.

1006
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,067
This is Cleeve's doing.

1007
01:08:22,934 --> 01:08:24,601
He has a concussion,

1008
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:27,601
possibly a subdural hematoma.

1009
01:08:27,601 --> 01:08:30,834
I can do more when we get him
to a hospital in Athens,

1010
01:08:30,834 --> 01:08:33,968
but he's too weak to move.

1011
01:08:33,968 --> 01:08:36,834
All I can do now
is make him comfortable.

1012
01:08:36,834 --> 01:08:39,601
Well, don't worry.

1013
01:08:39,601 --> 01:08:41,767
I'll stay with him.

1014
01:08:41,767 --> 01:08:43,400
(speaks in Greek)

1015
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:44,567
(speaks in Greek)

1016
01:08:55,534 --> 01:08:57,701
Looks like he's going
to be all right.

1017
01:08:57,701 --> 01:08:59,434
And the doctor's going
to stay with him

1018
01:08:59,434 --> 01:09:01,901
until he's well enough
to be moved.

1019
01:09:01,901 --> 01:09:05,834
But all the maps and the charts
of the volcano have gone.

1020
01:09:05,834 --> 01:09:07,467
Damn.

1021
01:09:07,467 --> 01:09:10,767
Cleeve and Zavros are probably
in the crater by now.

1022
01:09:10,767 --> 01:09:14,067
Tonight the planets align,
and they'll steal the treasure.

1023
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:16,601
And it's all my fault.

1024
01:09:16,601 --> 01:09:20,434
I wish I'd never heard
of Atlantis.

1025
01:09:31,067 --> 01:09:31,868
That's weird.

1026
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:33,200
What?

1027
01:09:34,367 --> 01:09:36,467
The lid.

1028
01:09:36,467 --> 01:09:37,701
It's not magnetic.

1029
01:09:40,534 --> 01:09:42,467
How can that be?

1030
01:09:42,467 --> 01:09:44,501
Well, I don't know.

1031
01:09:54,167 --> 01:09:55,901
W-what are you doing?

1032
01:09:55,901 --> 01:09:58,968
Trust me, professor,
trust me.

1033
01:10:20,334 --> 01:10:21,968
It's platinum.

1034
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:23,934
That's why it's not magnetic.

1035
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,467
I've never seen markings
like this before.

1036
01:10:27,467 --> 01:10:29,133
It can mean
only one thing.

1037
01:10:29,133 --> 01:10:32,701
It must be a page
from the Book of Atlantis,

1038
01:10:32,701 --> 01:10:35,367
hidden there
by Solon himself.

1039
01:10:35,367 --> 01:10:38,634
Kelly, can you take us
into the crater?

1040
01:10:38,634 --> 01:10:40,267
Yes.

1041
01:10:40,267 --> 01:10:42,400
If we leave now,
we can make it before sunset.

1042
01:10:43,934 --> 01:10:45,300
Come on.

1043
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:46,434
Well, it looks like
it was a temple.

1044
01:11:46,434 --> 01:11:49,400
Strange place for one.

1045
01:11:51,167 --> 01:11:53,067
Great place to hide
a treasure though.

1046
01:11:53,067 --> 01:11:55,267
Well, if there was an entrance,

1047
01:11:55,267 --> 01:11:57,868
it's long since been destroyed.

1048
01:12:15,734 --> 01:12:16,901
Here.

1049
01:12:23,067 --> 01:12:25,000
Let's clear it.

1050
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:35,667
In ya go, MacGyver.

1051
01:13:11,267 --> 01:13:12,801
MacGyver.

1052
01:13:12,801 --> 01:13:15,200
Did you find anything?

1053
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,834
Oh, yeah.

1054
01:13:16,834 --> 01:13:18,000
Bigtime.

1055
01:13:22,868 --> 01:13:24,968
Incredible.

1056
01:13:24,968 --> 01:13:27,501
Look familiar?

1057
01:13:29,868 --> 01:13:32,868
A Copernican model
of the solar system.

1058
01:13:32,868 --> 01:13:36,501
Built thousands of years
before Copernicus was born.

1059
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:45,667
The planets must be orbiting
closer to the alignment.

1060
01:13:47,133 --> 01:13:49,133
The gravitational shift
of the alignment's

1061
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:51,100
making the volcano unstable.

1062
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:52,601
I hate when that happens.

1063
01:13:56,033 --> 01:14:00,000
Solon said,
"Enter the Gates of Hades."

1064
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,501
Well, what are we waiting for?

1065
01:14:05,501 --> 01:14:07,367
Ah!

1066
01:14:22,968 --> 01:14:24,634
Poor devil.

1067
01:14:26,567 --> 01:14:27,601
What triggered it?

1068
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:47,634
Do you think it's Cleeve?

1069
01:14:47,634 --> 01:14:49,434
Fortunately, not.

1070
01:14:49,434 --> 01:14:52,100
You all remember General Zavros,

1071
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:55,200
my ex-associate.

1072
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:57,467
You terminate all
your partnerships like this?

1073
01:14:57,467 --> 01:14:58,601
On the contrary.

1074
01:14:58,601 --> 01:15:00,868
General Zavros
did it to himself.

1075
01:15:00,868 --> 01:15:04,167
As you can see, greed,
heedless of caution,

1076
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:06,000
is a highly combustible mixture.

1077
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,100
I, on the other hand,
am a very cautious fellow.

1078
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:12,033
So I waited for you to arrive
to show us a way past this...

1079
01:15:12,033 --> 01:15:13,200
impediment.

1080
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:15,167
Why should we help you?

1081
01:15:15,167 --> 01:15:18,901
Because the length of your lives
is directly proportionate

1082
01:15:18,901 --> 01:15:21,000
to how useful you are to me.

1083
01:15:31,467 --> 01:15:34,801
MacGyver, there must be a way
we can de-activate this fire.

1084
01:15:34,801 --> 01:15:36,567
Well, I suggest you find it...

1085
01:15:36,567 --> 01:15:37,801
quickly.

1086
01:15:47,601 --> 01:15:49,133
Maybe the answer's
in the first line

1087
01:15:49,133 --> 01:15:50,133
of Solon's riddle.

1088
01:15:50,133 --> 01:15:51,133
What do you think?

1089
01:15:51,133 --> 01:15:54,334
"The gods march in r--

1090
01:15:54,334 --> 01:15:56,701
Rank."

1091
01:15:56,701 --> 01:15:58,934
Yeah.
That one.

1092
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:15,300
Kelly, you wanna hand me
that platinum page?

1093
01:16:44,801 --> 01:16:46,367
It's a key.

1094
01:16:49,067 --> 01:16:52,434
Mercury...Venus...Earth...

1095
01:16:52,434 --> 01:16:53,834
the moon...

1096
01:17:06,167 --> 01:17:07,868
Well done, MacGyver.

1097
01:17:07,868 --> 01:17:10,701
Now I see why you were
Atticus' favorite student.

1098
01:17:10,701 --> 01:17:13,467
But what's this red crystal?

1099
01:17:13,467 --> 01:17:14,934
Perhaps it's a star.

1100
01:17:14,934 --> 01:17:17,601
We're not here
to discuss astronomy.

1101
01:17:17,601 --> 01:17:18,934
After you, MacGyver.

1102
01:17:31,801 --> 01:17:34,200
Keep moving!

1103
01:17:56,834 --> 01:17:59,901
MacGyver.

1104
01:17:59,901 --> 01:18:02,334
It's wonderful.

1105
01:18:02,334 --> 01:18:04,133
It's remarkable.

1106
01:18:04,133 --> 01:18:07,367
Tremendous.

1107
01:18:07,367 --> 01:18:09,701
Look, at long last.

1108
01:18:09,701 --> 01:18:13,200
The Temple of Ages!

1109
01:18:26,701 --> 01:18:29,534
This statue's extraordinary.

1110
01:18:29,534 --> 01:18:32,267
I've never seen anything like it.

1111
01:18:35,601 --> 01:18:37,634
I don't think it's a statue.

1112
01:18:37,634 --> 01:18:38,801
You're right.

1113
01:18:38,801 --> 01:18:40,968
I believe

1114
01:18:40,968 --> 01:18:42,734
we have discovered

1115
01:18:42,734 --> 01:18:45,767
Solon himself.

1116
01:18:45,767 --> 01:18:49,400
He must have been caught
in a volcanic eruption,

1117
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,868
and covered in hot ash.

1118
01:18:51,868 --> 01:18:53,667
Like the bodies at Pompeii.

1119
01:18:55,534 --> 01:18:57,501
He's hanging on to something here.

1120
01:19:06,133 --> 01:19:07,567
It's the platinum book.

1121
01:19:07,567 --> 01:19:11,434
Yes, like the page we found
inside the Ark.

1122
01:19:11,434 --> 01:19:14,467
Yes, well I think
I'd better hold onto that.

1123
01:19:14,467 --> 01:19:18,033
Might just help defray some
of my traveling expenses.

1124
01:19:24,934 --> 01:19:26,267
Look!

1125
01:19:26,267 --> 01:19:29,367
The gods march in rank.

1126
01:19:44,534 --> 01:19:46,434
The riddle says
when the planets are aligned,

1127
01:19:46,434 --> 01:19:48,634
we'll find
the Treasure of Atlantis.

1128
01:19:48,634 --> 01:19:49,801
Where is it?

1129
01:19:49,801 --> 01:19:51,267
The red crystal.

1130
01:19:52,767 --> 01:19:54,133
The one in the observatory?

1131
01:19:54,133 --> 01:19:55,701
We forgot the second line
of the riddle.

1132
01:19:55,701 --> 01:19:57,901
"Hecate races in the heavens."

1133
01:19:57,901 --> 01:20:00,167
The planets alone isn't enough
to reveal the treasure.

1134
01:20:00,167 --> 01:20:01,601
It takes something more.

1135
01:20:01,601 --> 01:20:02,801
Hecate has to appear.

1136
01:20:02,801 --> 01:20:04,167
Who the devil's Hecate?

1137
01:20:04,167 --> 01:20:09,167
A demon of the night
who rides a chariot of fire.

1138
01:20:09,167 --> 01:20:11,400
There she is.

1139
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:15,367
A meteor shower.

1140
01:20:15,367 --> 01:20:18,767
Unless I miss my guess,
the extra gravity oughta do it.

1141
01:20:34,467 --> 01:20:36,200
The Temple.

1142
01:20:46,701 --> 01:20:49,400
Where's the treasure?
Where is it?

1143
01:20:55,133 --> 01:20:56,200
Professor.

1144
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:57,334
I'm coming.

1145
01:20:57,334 --> 01:20:59,133
What's the line
in the riddle about, uh,

1146
01:20:59,133 --> 01:21:01,167
the ancients and the Book.

1147
01:21:01,167 --> 01:21:04,501
"The Book shall summon up
the power of the ancient ones."

1148
01:21:04,501 --> 01:21:06,601
The Book shall summon the power.

1149
01:21:06,601 --> 01:21:08,767
The Book.

1150
01:21:08,767 --> 01:21:09,601
Give me the Book.

1151
01:21:11,067 --> 01:21:12,567
You want the treasure,
give me the Book.

1152
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,567
These aren't book pages.

1153
01:21:31,567 --> 01:21:33,234
But what else could they be?

1154
01:21:33,234 --> 01:21:34,467
They're punch cards.

1155
01:21:34,467 --> 01:21:36,734
It must be an ancient...

1156
01:21:36,734 --> 01:21:38,200
...computer.

1157
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:40,400
It's a computer,
and these cards program it.

1158
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,033
Kelly, slide these in
where the symbols match.

1159
01:21:43,033 --> 01:21:45,267
Professor, let me see the Torch.
Here.

1160
01:21:45,267 --> 01:21:46,868
But how does it run?

1161
01:21:46,868 --> 01:21:48,868
A computer needs electricity.

1162
01:21:48,868 --> 01:21:50,767
Maybe not.

1163
01:21:50,767 --> 01:21:53,067
The people of Atlantis tapped
into the volcano for power.

1164
01:21:53,067 --> 01:21:55,767
They used geothermal technology.

1165
01:21:55,767 --> 01:21:57,701
You mean this thing runs on heat?

1166
01:21:57,701 --> 01:21:58,567
No.

1167
01:22:01,267 --> 01:22:03,000
Steam.

1168
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:28,934
Look!

1169
01:22:33,133 --> 01:22:35,467
Treasure chests.

1170
01:22:36,601 --> 01:22:37,300
Stay back.

1171
01:23:00,133 --> 01:23:02,434
It's nothing but paper.

1172
01:23:02,434 --> 01:23:04,701
Worthless scrolls.

1173
01:23:07,801 --> 01:23:09,334
Where's the treasure?

1174
01:23:09,334 --> 01:23:10,934
I think you're looking at it.

1175
01:23:10,934 --> 01:23:12,801
That's right.

1176
01:23:12,801 --> 01:23:16,200
Solon himself said
the Treasure of Atlantis

1177
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:19,434
has the power
to command men's minds.

1178
01:23:19,434 --> 01:23:20,801
Of course, books.

1179
01:23:20,801 --> 01:23:21,868
No.

1180
01:23:21,868 --> 01:23:23,667
It can't be true.

1181
01:23:24,801 --> 01:23:27,334
The Treasure of Atlantis...

1182
01:23:27,334 --> 01:23:28,767
is knowledge.

1183
01:23:28,767 --> 01:23:31,000
There has to be more.

1184
01:23:32,033 --> 01:23:33,167
No!

1185
01:23:33,167 --> 01:23:35,367
You're destroying the scrolls!

1186
01:23:35,367 --> 01:23:37,200
Get away you stupid old fool.

1187
01:23:39,734 --> 01:23:40,567
I want treasure.

1188
01:23:59,133 --> 01:24:01,100
We gotta go.

1189
01:24:01,934 --> 01:24:03,634
But all this knowledge.

1190
01:24:03,634 --> 01:24:05,467
We can't let it be destroyed.

1191
01:24:05,467 --> 01:24:06,968
Kelly, come on!

1192
01:24:06,968 --> 01:24:08,434
Come on, Kelly!

1193
01:24:21,534 --> 01:24:22,734
Forget that.

1194
01:24:22,734 --> 01:24:24,667
Well, that's our only way out.

1195
01:24:34,734 --> 01:24:36,067
Maybe we can tap into

1196
01:24:36,067 --> 01:24:38,634
a little geothermal power
of our own.

1197
01:24:38,634 --> 01:24:41,467
Geothermal power?

1198
01:24:51,234 --> 01:24:52,501
Professor.
Yes?

1199
01:24:52,501 --> 01:24:54,267
Stuff your jacket
into one of those pipes.

1200
01:24:54,267 --> 01:24:56,133
Put a rock on top of it.

1201
01:24:57,767 --> 01:24:59,200
Kelly, stand by the Torch.

1202
01:25:01,133 --> 01:25:04,334
Well, whatever you've got
in mind, MacGyver, hurry.

1203
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:44,033
Stand back, professor.

1204
01:25:44,033 --> 01:25:46,000
All right, Kelly, hit it.

1205
01:26:18,567 --> 01:26:19,667
Shut it off, Kelly.

1206
01:26:39,567 --> 01:26:40,734
All right, come up here.

1207
01:26:40,734 --> 01:26:43,868
Professor, mind the Torch.

1208
01:26:43,868 --> 01:26:45,501
You all right with this?
Yeah.

1209
01:26:45,501 --> 01:26:47,534
Hang on.
Hit it.

1210
01:27:14,767 --> 01:27:15,100
All right, stop it.

1211
01:27:23,534 --> 01:27:24,834
All right, professor.
Your turn.

1212
01:27:25,868 --> 01:27:27,100
Come on.

1213
01:27:28,868 --> 01:27:30,100
Top rope.

1214
01:27:33,167 --> 01:27:33,968
Hang on.

1215
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,300
Oh, blast.

1216
01:28:59,801 --> 01:29:00,834
Hold on, MacGyver.

1217
01:29:06,067 --> 01:29:08,734
Pull it, Kelly.
Pull!

1218
01:29:17,167 --> 01:29:18,634
Come on. Come on.

1219
01:29:37,234 --> 01:29:38,634
Thanks.

1220
01:29:46,501 --> 01:29:47,734
Oh.

1221
01:29:47,734 --> 01:29:49,000
Let's go.

1222
01:30:04,367 --> 01:30:06,801
Thousands of years ago,

1223
01:30:06,801 --> 01:30:09,667
before time itself was measured,

1224
01:30:09,667 --> 01:30:10,934
as we know it,

1225
01:30:10,934 --> 01:30:13,968
there...

1226
01:30:13,968 --> 01:30:15,868
was...

1227
01:30:15,868 --> 01:30:18,267
Atlantis.

1228
01:30:19,267 --> 01:30:21,067
It was a great city,

1229
01:30:21,067 --> 01:30:23,834
dedicated to art and science.

1230
01:30:23,834 --> 01:30:26,968
And the people of Atlantis lived
in high-rise buildings,

1231
01:30:26,968 --> 01:30:28,834
and had indoor plumbing.

1232
01:30:28,834 --> 01:30:33,033
They also invented
geothermal technology,

1233
01:30:33,033 --> 01:30:35,434
and there are
even more important lessons

1234
01:30:35,434 --> 01:30:38,300
to learn from Atlantis.

1235
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:40,601
Now then, what are they?

1236
01:30:40,601 --> 01:30:41,701
Yes, Brian.

1237
01:30:41,701 --> 01:30:42,701
They created democracy.

1238
01:30:42,701 --> 01:30:45,100
Very good. Yes.
Another. Taylor.

1239
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:46,734
They abolished slavery.

1240
01:30:46,734 --> 01:30:48,567
Excellent, excellent.
Liam.

1241
01:30:48,567 --> 01:30:50,601
There were no executions.

1242
01:30:50,601 --> 01:30:52,167
Yes, that's true.
Joanna.

1243
01:30:52,167 --> 01:30:54,534
Men and women
were treated as equals.

1244
01:30:54,534 --> 01:30:56,767
That's right, that's right.
At the back, Sam.

1245
01:30:56,767 --> 01:30:58,667
They believed in peace,
not war.

1246
01:30:58,667 --> 01:31:00,234
Absolutely right.

1247
01:31:00,234 --> 01:31:02,634
Now can you tell me,

1248
01:31:02,634 --> 01:31:05,968
what was
the Treasure of Atlantis?

1249
01:31:05,968 --> 01:31:07,701
Knowledge.

1250
01:31:07,701 --> 01:31:09,734
I can't hear you.
Knowledge.

1251
01:31:09,734 --> 01:31:11,634
I still can't hear you.

1252
01:31:11,634 --> 01:31:12,868
Knowledge!

1253
01:31:12,868 --> 01:31:15,901
Absolutely correct. Knowledge.

1254
01:31:17,467 --> 01:31:20,834
You are all
my brightest students.
