1
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,331
I'm out in the prime cut
of the big green.

2
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:36,062
Behind me is Ed and Rowdy, members
of an up-and-coming subadult gang.

3
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,469
They're challenging everything, including me.
Goes with the territory.

4
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:43,407
If I show weakness,
if I retreat,

5
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:45,706
I may be hurt,
I may be killed.

6
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:49,214
I must hold my own
if I'm gonna stay within this land.

7
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:51,978
For once there is weakness,
they will exploit it, they will take me out,

8
00:00:52,086 --> 00:00:55,852
they will decapitate me,
they will chop me into bits and pieces.

9
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:57,924
I'm dead.

10
00:00:58,025 --> 00:01:02,086
But so far, I persevere.

11
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:03,629
Persevere.

12
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,630
Most times
I'm a kind warrior out here.

13
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:12,536
Most times, I am gentle,
I am like a flower,

14
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,269
I'm like... I'm like
a fly on the wall,

15
00:01:16,377 --> 00:01:20,473
observing, noncommittal,
noninvasive in any way.

16
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:23,243
Occasionally I am challenged.
And in that case,

17
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,547
the kind warrior must,
must, must become a samurai.

18
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:28,679
Must become so,

19
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:31,782
so formidable,

20
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:35,461
so fearless of death,

21
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:36,996
so strong

22
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:40,794
that he will win, he will win.

23
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:44,632
Even the bears will believe
that you are more powerful.

24
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:48,139
And in a sense
you must be more powerful

25
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:52,372
if you are to survive in this land
with the bear.

26
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,916
No one knew that.
No one ever friggin' knew

27
00:01:56,016 --> 00:02:00,214
that there are times when my life
is on the precipice of death

28
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:03,552
and that these bears can bite,
they can kill.

29
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:06,091
And if I am weak,
I go down.

30
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:08,127
I love them with all my heart.
I will protect them.

31
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:12,757
I will die for them, but I will not die
at their claws and paws.

32
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:16,359
I will fight. I will be strong.
I'll be one of them.

33
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,268
I will be... the master.

34
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:24,374
But still a kind warrior.

35
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:33,911
Love you, Rowdy.

36
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:36,512
Give it to me, baby.

37
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:38,649
That's what I'm talkin' about.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

38
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,624
That's what I'm talkin' about.

39
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:47,163
I can smell death
all over my fingers.

40
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:15,858
<i>All these majestic creatures were filmed</i>
<i>by Timothy Treadwell</i>

41
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:20,332
<i>who lived among wild grizzlies</i>
<i>for 13 summers</i>.

42
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:26,064
<i>He went to remote areas</i>
<i>of the Alaskan peninsula</i>

43
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:28,437
<i>believing that</i>
<i>he was needed there</i>

44
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:33,309
<i>to protect these animals</i>
<i>and educate the public</i>.

45
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:36,406
<i>During his last five years</i>
<i>out there,</i>

46
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:38,542
<i>he took along a video camera</i>

47
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:42,679
<i>and shot over 100 hours</i>
<i>of footage</i>.

48
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:48,057
<i>What Treadwell intended was to show</i>
<i>these bears in their natural habitat</i>.

49
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:53,689
<i>Having myself filmed</i>
<i>in the wilderness of jungles,</i>

50
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:56,565
<i>I found that beyond</i>
<i>the wildlife film,</i>

51
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,332
<i>in his material lay</i>
<i>dormant a story</i>

52
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,068
<i>of astonishing beauty</i>
<i>and depth</i>.

53
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:07,405
<i>I discovered a film</i>
<i>of human ecstasies</i>

54
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:10,449
<i>and darkest inner turmoil</i>.

55
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,748
<i>As if there was</i>
<i>a desire in him</i>

56
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:17,119
<i>to leave the confinements</i>
<i>of his humanness</i>

57
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:19,158
<i>and bond with the bears,</i>

58
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:24,197
<i>Treadwell reached out,</i>
<i>seeking a primordial encounter</i>.

59
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:29,031
<i>But in doing so, he crossed</i>
<i>an invisible borderline</i>.

60
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,809
Go back and play.

61
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:58,488
Go ahead back. Go back.

62
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:00,692
Go back.

63
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:05,437
This is a subadult.
And this is what happens to them.

64
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:08,906
They work together,
and they get really powerful.

65
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:11,842
As you can see,
I'm just feet away.

66
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:14,778
You just relax.
You just relax.

67
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:19,651
He's now moving away from me.

68
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:24,918
I've now proven myself as being able to hold
my ground and therefore earning their respect.

69
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:28,222
This is Rowdy, the bear.
And he's rowdy.

70
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:30,297
He's gettin' bigger.

71
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:35,668
Knew him from... He was a little dot
a couple of years ago.

72
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:38,499
He's gettin' to be a big boy.
Anyway, we're doing just fine.

73
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,467
But that was a challenge,

74
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:44,510
and you have to remain cool
in the challenge, in the moment.

75
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,476
If you don't, you're dead.

76
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,676
They can kill. They can bite.
They can decapitate.

77
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:21,906
Excuse me. Hey.

78
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:24,711
Hey!

79
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:27,946
It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.

80
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,922
I didn't mean to get in your way.

81
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:34,357
Wow. It's okay.
You're the boss.

82
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:38,795
Nice job. Wow! Nice job.

83
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,795
I gotta think, he was over ten-feet high,
don't you?

84
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,735
He's a big bear!
He's a big bear!

85
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:47,136
A very big bear! Wow!

86
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:51,303
Anyway, he's over here
rub-a-dub-dubbing.

87
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:53,039
He's a big bear!

88
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:55,809
<i>The excitement Treadwell felt</i>

89
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,817
<i>connected him immediately</i>
<i>with children</i>.

90
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,479
<i>In his campaign</i>
<i>to create awareness,</i>

91
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,318
<i>he reached thousands and thousands</i>
<i>of school children</i>

92
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:06,985
<i>who would remember</i>
<i>his fabulous storytelling</i>

93
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:11,087
<i>as one of the highlights</i>
<i>of their school years</i>.

94
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:13,689
<i>He took his mission</i>
<i>so seriously</i>

95
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:16,668
<i>that he never solicited for a fee</i>.

96
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:22,737
<i>Over time, he reached the status</i>
<i>of a national celebrity</i>.

97
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:27,342
<i>Timothy Treadwell is crazy</i>
<i>about grizzly bears</i>.

98
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:29,348
<i>How crazy? Sometimes</i>...

99
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,918
<i>It was as if he had become a star</i>

100
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:34,487
<i>by virtue of his own invention</i>.

101
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:38,684
I would be within
the physical presence of bears

102
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,886
24 hours a day
for months at a time.

103
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:45,431
This is... cra<i>z</i>y.
This is nuts.

104
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:48,023
These are the most dangerous animals
on the face of the earth.

105
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,228
- Well...
- And you want to go

106
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:52,703
and put yourself in harm's way
24 hours a day?

107
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,501
I think they've been misunderstood.

108
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:58,476
<i>How can I believe that if you are</i>
<i>about to be killed by a bear,</i>

109
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:02,709
that you wouldn't say, "I made a mistake.
I'd like to have a gun"?

110
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,683
I would never, ever kill a bear
in defense of my own life.

111
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:08,880
Would not go into a bear's home
and kill a bear.

112
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:15,823
One day, I came home

113
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:19,296
and I was sitting on my patio.

114
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:22,493
My wife was in the bedroom
with the TV on.

115
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:25,629
And I heard her scream.

116
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,441
And I thought
she'd fallen or something.

117
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:33,570
I came in and she was sitting
on the edge of the bed,

118
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,841
staring at the television.

119
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:38,417
I looked at the television,

120
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,612
and I saw Timmy's face.

121
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:43,519
I hadn't heard the sound
or the news yet,

122
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:46,593
but I knew just by seeing
Timmy's face on TV

123
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,287
and hearing
my wife's reaction,

124
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,921
that the worst had happened.

125
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,830
Not necessarily a surprise,

126
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:59,131
but... the worst.

127
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:03,633
<i>I never have days</i>
<i>when I grieve for Timmy</i>

128
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:07,145
<i>as I have with other friends</i>
<i>who have died</i>.

129
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:09,442
<i>They feel dead</i>.

130
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,040
<i>Timmy doesn't feel dead</i>.

131
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:17,985
<i>This is the last photo</i>
<i>of Timothy Treadwell</i>.

132
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:21,185
<i>It was taken at the beginning</i>
<i>of his 13th summer</i>

133
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:23,729
<i>in the wilds of Alaska</i>.

134
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:28,767
<i>With him is Amie Huguenard,</i>
<i>who would die by his side</i>.

135
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:33,237
<i>The man who took the photo</i>
<i>was Willy Fulton,</i>

136
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,137
<i>a close friend of Timothy's,</i>

137
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:38,268
<i>and the pilot</i>
<i>who would bring him to this remote part</i>

138
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:40,676
<i>of the Alaskan peninsula</i>.

139
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:46,217
<i>Treadwell saw himself</i>
<i>as the guardian of this land</i>

140
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,312
<i>and stylized himself</i>
<i>as Prince Valiant,</i>

141
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:54,383
<i>fighting the bad guys with their schemes</i>
<i>to do harm to the bears</i>.

142
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:58,453
<i>But all this land is</i>
<i>a federally protected reserve,</i>

143
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:01,193
<i>part of Katmai National Park</i>.

144
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:15,279
<i>This big plain,</i>
<i>Treadwell called "The Sanctuary."</i>

145
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:17,873
<i>Here he would spend</i>
<i>the early summer months</i>

146
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:20,419
<i>before moving along</i>
<i>some 35 miles</i>

147
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,920
<i>to this densely overgrown area</i>

148
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:24,923
<i>which he called</i>
<i>"The Grizzly Maze"</i>

149
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:28,461
<i>where he would observe</i>
<i>the late summer salmon run</i>.

150
00:10:30,998 --> 00:10:35,025
<i>It was here that Fulton</i>
<i>would pick him up in the fall</i>.

151
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:40,540
<i>On October 6 last year,</i>
<i>this is the spot here at Kaflia Lake</i>

152
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:43,337
<i>where I pulled in</i>
<i>to pick up Tim and Amie</i>.

153
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:48,614
<i>Typical day out here</i>.
<i>Rain, foggy, a lot of wind</i>.

154
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,941
<i>It was kinda strange</i>.
<i>Didn't see him, didn't hear anything</i>.

155
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:56,181
<i>No gear on the beach</i>
<i>or anything</i>.

156
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,814
I tied up, and I started
yelling a little bit.

157
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:02,486
"Tim! Amie!" And no answer.

158
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:06,191
I caught a little tiny bit
of movement up on the hill,

159
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:09,757
so I'm like, it was windy, maybe they
just couldn't hear me or something.

160
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,930
So I decided I'd go up
in the camp,

161
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,065
and see what was going on.

162
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:18,372
And headed off
up through the alders.

163
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:21,311
It's kind of a thick trail
up into camp there.

164
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,841
Got about three-quarters
of the way up the hill,

165
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:30,514
and something just didn't feel right at all,
something seemed strange.

166
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:34,390
I'm yelling and no answer.
So I turned around

167
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:37,588
and started coming back down the trail
at a pretty good clip, I guess.

168
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:40,690
I was kinda... trottin' along.

169
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:44,703
And as I got in the thickest
part of the alders right here,

170
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:47,569
as I got near the airplane,
I just happened to turn around.

171
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:50,837
And I turned around
and looked and...

172
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:57,482
Pretty nasty-Iooking bear
that I had seen here before

173
00:11:57,584 --> 00:12:01,281
is just sneaking slow,
with his head down.

174
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:05,381
Just the meanest-Iooking thing
coming through the brush.

175
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:07,756
So I jumped on the airplane
real quick and untied it.

176
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:11,820
And took off. Turned around,
flew over camp there.

177
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,895
Just looked down
and saw a human rib cage

178
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:20,939
that I knew had to be
either Tim or Amie laying there.

179
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,441
And he was just eating that.

180
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,977
And as l...
So I circled around again.

181
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,411
<i>Got really low,</i>
<i>and tried to run him off</i>.

182
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:32,349
<i>Just over and over again with the airplane</i>.
<i>Every time I would come over,</i>

183
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:35,979
he'd just start eating faster
and faster and crouch over

184
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,580
this rib cage there.

185
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:41,058
And right at that time,

186
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:44,927
I just reali<i>z</i>ed, "Wow!

187
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:48,967
I was pretty close to gettin' eaten myself"
is what I thought.

188
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:52,197
And this shot of adrenalin like
I've never had just came over me.

189
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:55,468
And my throat went...
couldn't breathe.

190
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:59,306
My face went numb.
My arms and legs went numb.

191
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:02,040
And then I called back...

192
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:04,413
back to the office,

193
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:06,952
and told them what happened out here,
what I thought had happened.

194
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:12,491
And that we would need some assistance
out here. That we had some problems.

195
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:19,355
After the Park Service arrived,
then I'm leading them up through the alders.

196
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:22,594
This is the same trail
that I'd come up the first time.

197
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:26,138
We got to about right here,
and we just stopped.

198
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,673
We stopped just to take
a look around.

199
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:33,735
Right then, one guy with us
just yells, "Bear!"

200
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:37,044
And they all spin around. These gun barrels
come over the top of my head.

201
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,243
Boy, they just start
firing them off.

202
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,411
I ducked down 'cause
they hadn't given me a gun.

203
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:44,217
I'd look up, and they'd fire
over and over again.

204
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:49,557
Then I look up when they're done firing
and there's just a cloud of smoke here.

205
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:52,359
I look over, and the bear
is laying right there.

206
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:55,059
They're yelling at me,
just don't go near the bear.

207
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,136
I knew he was dead.

208
00:13:57,237 --> 00:14:01,071
He'd been shot in the head
and the neck and everywhere.

209
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:04,905
He was just laying here
pretty much lifeless.

210
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:09,243
And this is right where...
where the bear...

211
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:12,443
I told them at the time, I said,
"This is the bear that killed Tim."

212
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:15,783
I knew, 'cause that was the same bear
that I had seen down here

213
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:19,757
looking at me right through
the alder bushes there.

214
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,727
So I knew this was the bear.
I said, "Yep, that'll be the one."

215
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:25,764
That wound up being the bear

216
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:29,267
that they found Tim in.

217
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:34,272
I'm here on camera with Olie, the big old bear.
The big old grumpy bear.

218
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:38,242
He just took Cracker
out of the creek area.

219
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:40,506
There's not a lot of fish here

220
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:43,310
so you can understand him wanting
to have control of the creek.

221
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:46,146
He's acting like
an alpha male here.

222
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:50,622
Which, I guess, for the fact that he is
the only male here, he is the alpha male.

223
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:53,818
At any rate, he's also...
He's a surly bear.

224
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:56,020
I met him on the path
the other day,

225
00:14:56,129 --> 00:15:00,293
after feeling sorry for him, thinking
that he was a bit thin, a bit gaunt...

226
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,461
And he promptly charged me
with the intent to probably strike.

227
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,766
I know the language
of the bear.

228
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:10,536
I was able to deter him from doing that,
and I'm fine.

229
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:12,578
But I will tell you something.

230
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:16,979
It is the old bear, one who is struggling
for survival,

231
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:20,610
and an aggressive one at that,

232
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,086
who is the one
that you must be very careful of.

233
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:26,158
For these are the bears,
that on occasion,

234
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:30,423
do, for survival,
kill and eat humans.

235
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:34,398
Could Olie, the big old bear,
possibly kill and eat Timothy Treadwell?

236
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:39,097
What do you think, Olie?
I think if you were weak around him,

237
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:42,766
you're going down his gullet,
going down the pipe.

238
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:46,842
<i>Right up top of the hill here</i>
<i>is where we found</i>

239
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:49,882
<i>what was left of Tim's body</i>...
<i>his head and a little bit of backbone</i>.

240
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:52,679
And we found

241
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:56,313
a hand, arm,
wristwatch still on the arm.

242
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:59,790
I remember the watch.
Shoot, I can remember the watch.

243
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:01,861
And here's a guy

244
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:05,659
that used to dive in the lake down here
naked to scare the airplanes away.

245
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:09,758
And here I'm finding his watch
and arm on top of the hill.

246
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:14,568
And here's about all that's left
of the bear that killed him.

247
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:17,939
A few pieces of rib bone.

248
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:21,480
This bear was shot,
and drug off and eaten

249
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:24,846
by other bears here,
right in this area.

250
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:29,388
The tough thing out of all this is Tim would
have never wanted to see any bears killed.

251
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,185
Even if they had killed him,
he would've...

252
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:35,750
He would've been happy
if nobody found him.

253
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:39,423
Nobody found any remains.
Nobody found his camp or anything.

254
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:42,160
He would've been
perfectly content.

255
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:45,499
He definitely lived
on the edge. But he...

256
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,568
He was a little smarter than everyone
gave him credit for.

257
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:52,144
He made it out here a long time
before they caught up with him.

258
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:55,646
And actually the bear
that wound up killing him

259
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:58,684
was just a dirty rotten bear
that he didn't like anyway.

260
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:01,379
He wanted to be friends with,
but never happened.

261
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:06,248
I want to introduce you to one of the key
role players in this year's expedition.

262
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,190
The bear's name is The Grinch.

263
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:10,956
The Grinch has come on
to be one of the more

264
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:14,693
frequent bears
here in the Gri<i>zz</i>ly Ma<i>z</i>e.

265
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:17,599
The Grinch is a female
of about five years of age.

266
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,036
Oh, hi, Grinch. Hi.

267
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,700
And she has kind of
an aggressive attitude.

268
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,504
Hi.

269
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:29,048
If I turn around too much, she'll bite me.
It's okay. Hi. How are you?

270
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:30,980
How are you?

271
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:38,249
Don't you do that.
Don't you do that!

272
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:41,389
Back off!

273
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:50,736
Don't do it.

274
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:52,862
It's okay. I love you.

275
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:56,100
I love you. I love you.
I love you.

276
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:58,302
I love you. I'm sorry.

277
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,276
I'm Sam Egli.

278
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:04,009
I was called out as a helicopter pilot

279
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:09,749
to assist on the cleanup after
the Treadwell tragedy of last winter.

280
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:11,790
I was in there the morning

281
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:15,292
<i>the Fish and Game officers</i>
<i>were there examining</i>

282
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:19,957
<i>the bear that had done</i>
<i>the killing</i>.

283
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:21,829
<i>The bear was all cut open</i>.

284
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:26,338
It was full of people.
It was full of clothing. It was...

285
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:30,671
We hauled away
four garbage bags of people

286
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,540
out of that bear.

287
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:38,380
Treadwell was, I think,

288
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:40,612
meaning well, trying to do things

289
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,417
to help the resource of the bears.

290
00:18:44,524 --> 00:18:48,551
But to me
he was acting like...

291
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:52,222
like he was working with people

292
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:56,393
wearing bear costumes out there
instead of wild animals.

293
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:00,331
Those bears are big
and ferocious,

294
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,876
and they come equipped
to kill ya and eat ya.

295
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:08,107
And that's just what
Treadwell was asking for.

296
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:10,307
He got what
he was asking for.

297
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,510
He got what he deserved,
in my opinion.

298
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:18,080
The tragedy of it
was taking the girl with him.

299
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:21,493
I think the only reason

300
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:26,554
that Treadwell lasted
as long in the game as he did

301
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:31,694
was that the bears probably thought
there was something wrong with him.

302
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:35,968
Like he was mentally retarded
or something.

303
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:43,411
That bear, I think,
that day decided that he had

304
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:47,213
either had enough
of Tim Treadwell,

305
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,882
or that something clicked
in that bear's head

306
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:55,392
that he thought, "Hey, you know,
he might be good to eat."

307
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,398
<i>My opinion,</i>
<i>I think Treadwell thought</i>

308
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:03,435
<i>these bears were big,</i>
<i>scary looking, harmless creatures</i>

309
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:06,334
<i>that he could go up and pet</i>
<i>and sing to,</i>

310
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:09,203
- <i>and they would bond</i>
- Look it there!

311
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:12,972
<i>As children of the universe</i>
<i>or some odd</i>.

312
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:18,540
<i>I think he had lost sight</i>
<i>of what was really going on</i>.

313
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:34,062
<i>He wanted to become like the bear</i>.

314
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:37,603
Perhaps it was religious,
but not in the true sense of religion.

315
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:41,504
I think perhaps he wanted to

316
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:43,007
mutate into a wild animal

317
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,339
as he says in this last letter.

318
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:48,972
He says, "I have to mutually
mutate into a wild animal

319
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:51,209
to handle the life
I live out here."

320
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:54,252
I think there's
a religious sense in that

321
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:58,984
in the sense of connecting so deeply
that you're no longer human.

322
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:01,686
And that is a religious experience.

323
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:04,861
Here's another example.

324
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:09,401
"There are many times that
I feel death is the best option.

325
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:12,699
My work would be
much more seriously looked at

326
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:16,400
and possibly make the difference
that in living, I can't do."

327
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:19,808
I think that was
sort of a paradox for him.

328
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:24,406
That he felt not worthy enough
to get his message across at times.

329
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:27,008
And so, maybe,
in the drama of death

330
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,487
his message would be more poignant
and reach out to more people.

331
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:34,390
<i>But his message stirred</i>
<i>a lot of controversy</i>.

332
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:38,362
<i>The Gaedes have collected</i>
<i>thousands of angry letters</i>.

333
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,523
I can read you some of...

334
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:44,569
I picked out three
of these vitriolic hate mails.

335
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:47,640
They cover the gamut.

336
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:52,005
"Stereotypical environmentalist.

337
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:54,341
Just as long as the donations
keep coming,

338
00:21:54,447 --> 00:21:58,975
furthering the antihuman
eco-religion as a noble cause,

339
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:01,053
who cares about reality?"

340
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:04,317
And the very idea

341
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:08,326
that Timothy made a lot of money
doing what he did

342
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:12,455
is absolutely preposterous, 'cause
he's one of the poorest people we knew.

343
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:14,726
Another one.

344
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:18,736
"A bear diet consists
of liberals and Dems,"

345
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,362
meaning Democrats.

346
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:24,239
"A bear diet consists of liberals and Dems
and wacko environmentalists

347
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:28,110
that think the spotted owl
is the most important thing in the world.

348
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:32,378
We need to somehow drastically increase
the number of bears in America,

349
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:36,751
especially in such key spots
as the Berkeley campus."

350
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,322
<i>I, too, would like to step in here</i>
<i>in his defense,</i>

351
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:47,229
<i>not as an ecologist,</i>
<i>but as a filmmaker</i>.

352
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:50,928
<i>He captured such glorious</i>
<i>improvised moments,</i>

353
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:53,198
<i>the likes of which</i>
<i>the studio directors,</i>

354
00:22:53,306 --> 00:22:56,707
<i>with their union crews,</i>
<i>can never dream of</i>.

355
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:04,179
Okay.

356
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,978
What are you doing up there?
That's where you're sitting?

357
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:22,897
There. Go.

358
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:27,564
Go! Go! Go!

359
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,906
Come on! Come on!

360
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:34,739
Come on! Run home!

361
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:47,022
Come on!

362
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:09,778
Hi.

363
00:24:09,882 --> 00:24:12,180
Hey, you little champion.

364
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:14,480
Hi. How are you?

365
00:24:14,587 --> 00:24:16,452
You're such a good champion.

366
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:19,047
I love you. I love you.

367
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,684
Get up there,
and guard that tent.

368
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:33,571
I'm here with one of my favorite bears.
It's Mr. Chocolate.

369
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:35,607
Hi, Mr. Chocolate.

370
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:39,337
He is the star of many people
across the country:

371
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:41,436
Children, people, adults.

372
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:43,412
And we're here
in the Gri<i>zz</i>ly Sanctuary.

373
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:46,144
But I'm wrapping up my work
in the Gri<i>zz</i>ly Sanctuary. Why is that?

374
00:24:46,252 --> 00:24:48,117
Because I'm on my way
to the Gri<i>zz</i>ly Ma<i>z</i>e

375
00:24:48,221 --> 00:24:52,590
where bears do not have human protection,
but are under human threat.

376
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:56,822
Bears like Aunt Melissa. Bears like Demon,
Hatchet, Downey and Tabitha.

377
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:58,863
And it's time for me
to go to protect them.

378
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:01,024
I wish I could bring
Mr. Chocolate with me.

379
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:03,033
You'd be great protection there.

380
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:06,798
He's been with me for over a decade, and he's
been my good friend and I appreciate it.

381
00:25:06,906 --> 00:25:09,431
Thank you, Mr. Chocolate.
I'll see you again next year.

382
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:13,000
No. I'll see him again at expedition...
end of this expedition.

383
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:16,411
I'll be back here to join you again.
Back with Mr. Chocolate.

384
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:21,146
But first, it's off to the exciting
and often dangerous Gri<i>zz</i>ly Ma<i>z</i>e.

385
00:25:22,421 --> 00:25:25,322
<i>Now the scene seems to be over</i>.

386
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:29,292
<i>But as a filmmaker,</i>
<i>sometimes things fall into your lap</i>

387
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:31,955
<i>which you couldn't expect,</i>
<i>never even dream of</i>.

388
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:33,793
Hi, Spirit.

389
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,563
<i>There is something like</i>
<i>an inexplicable magic of cinema</i>.

390
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:40,497
Hi, Spirit.

391
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:47,903
Well, I'm here with Mr. Chocolate
and Spirit, the fox.

392
00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:50,881
And here comes
some of her pups. Yea!

393
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:52,814
Here comes
some of her pups.

394
00:25:55,021 --> 00:25:56,784
Hi.

395
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:01,559
Hi, Spirit.

396
00:26:03,496 --> 00:26:05,293
Hi, Spirit. Hello, baby.

397
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,860
Coming down.

398
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,070
What are you doing to that hat?

399
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:18,905
Where's that hat going?

400
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:39,191
Hey, who's stealing that hat?

401
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:42,961
Let me see that hat.
Ghost, I want that hat.

402
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:46,698
Man! Ghost is bad.

403
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:50,305
Ghost, what are you doing
with that hat?

404
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:53,003
Ghost, that hat
is a very important hat.

405
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,808
Drop it! Hey!

406
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:59,509
Oh, goddamn it!

407
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:02,144
I can't believe this!

408
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:04,119
Ghost!

409
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:06,316
Ghost, where's that fucking hat?

410
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:09,861
That hat is so frigging valuable
for this trip.

411
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:13,090
Ghost, you come back here
with that friggin' hat.

412
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:16,225
If it's in the den,
I'm gonna fucking explode.

413
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:18,166
Ghost, where's that hat?

414
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,363
It's not okay for you to steal it.

415
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:23,806
Oh, man!

416
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:25,274
Oh, man!

417
00:27:26,412 --> 00:27:28,642
It's a friggin' den.

418
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:31,439
One of the things I've
heard about Mr. Treadwell,

419
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,643
and you can see
in a lot of his films,

420
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:36,654
is that he tended
to want to become a bear.

421
00:27:36,756 --> 00:27:40,556
Some people that I've spoken with would
encounter him in the field,

422
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,924
and he would act like a bear,
he would "woof" at them.

423
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:47,796
He would act in the same way a bear
would when they were surprised.

424
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:52,997
Why he did this is only known to him.
No one really knows for sure.

425
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:55,369
But when you spend
a lot of time with bears,

426
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:58,568
especially when you're in the field
with them day after day,

427
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:00,737
there's a siren song,
there's a calling

428
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:03,440
that makes you wanna come in
and spend more time in the world.

429
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:05,779
<i>Because it is a simpler world</i>.

430
00:28:05,885 --> 00:28:07,910
<i>It is a wonderful thing,</i>

431
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,079
<i>but in fact</i>
<i>it's a harsh world</i>.

432
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:13,022
<i>It's a different world that bears</i>
<i>live in than we do</i>.

433
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,958
<i>So there is that desire</i>
<i>to get into their world,</i>

434
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:20,055
<i>but the reality is we never can because</i>
<i>we're very different than they are</i>.

435
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:40,944
<i>The line between bear and human</i>

436
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:44,284
<i>has apparently always</i>
<i>been respected</i>

437
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,915
<i>by the native communities</i>
<i>of Alaska</i>.

438
00:28:47,026 --> 00:28:50,928
<i>We visited the curator</i>
<i>of Kodiak's Alutiiq Museum,</i>

439
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:56,593
<i>which had recently been raided</i>
<i>by tourists out of control</i>.

440
00:28:56,702 --> 00:29:00,229
Somebody wanted it so much,
they cut the paw off.

441
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:02,705
They stole it from here.

442
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:06,471
It was quite tragic for us
because it's on loan

443
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:10,106
and they came in and took it.

444
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,784
And how do you see
Timothy Treadwell's story?

445
00:29:14,887 --> 00:29:17,981
I see it as something that's both...

446
00:29:19,225 --> 00:29:22,456
It's tragic because,

447
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:24,756
yeah, he died
and his girlfriend died

448
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,765
because he tried to be a bear.

449
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:31,826
He tried to act like a bear, and for us
on the island, you don't do that.

450
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:35,065
You don't invade
on their territory.

451
00:29:35,174 --> 00:29:36,471
You...

452
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:38,873
When you're in their territory,
you know you're there.

453
00:29:38,978 --> 00:29:41,776
And when you're nearby,

454
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:44,748
you make sure that
they know you're around.

455
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:50,478
You know, for him to act
like a bear the way he did,

456
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:52,352
would be...

457
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:55,392
I don't know.
To me, it was the ultimate

458
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:58,952
of disrespecting the bear
and what the bear represents.

459
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:02,625
But he tried to protect the bears,
didn't he?

460
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:06,801
I think he did more damage
to the bears than he did...

461
00:30:06,906 --> 00:30:11,502
Because when you habituate bears to
humans, they think all humans are safe.

462
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:16,272
<i>Where I grew up, the bears avoid us</i>
<i>and we avoid them</i>.

463
00:30:16,382 --> 00:30:18,612
<i>They're not habituated to us</i>.

464
00:30:18,717 --> 00:30:22,050
<i>If I look at it from my culture,</i>
<i>Timothy Treadwell crossed a boundary</i>

465
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:25,646
<i>that we have lived with</i>
<i>for 7,000 years</i>.

466
00:30:25,758 --> 00:30:27,726
<i>It's an unspoken boundary,</i>
<i>an unknown boundary</i>.

467
00:30:27,827 --> 00:30:30,557
<i>But when we know</i>
<i>we've crossed it,</i>

468
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:32,927
<i>we pay the price</i>.

469
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:09,558
Jewel, I apologi<i>z</i>e

470
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:13,968
that this wristwatch
is still in an evidence bag.

471
00:31:14,073 --> 00:31:17,975
However, I want you to have this watch.

472
00:31:18,077 --> 00:31:21,410
I think that it is important
that you have it.

473
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:25,215
You knew Timothy for a long time.

474
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:28,309
My understanding is that you lived together
for three years.

475
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,320
You were very close to him.

476
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:32,652
Yeah. He was my boyfriend for three years.
He was my boss.

477
00:31:32,758 --> 00:31:36,285
He was a lot of things
to me in 20 years.

478
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:40,161
I understand that. And that's the reason
I want you to have this.

479
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:42,359
This really should be yours.

480
00:31:43,836 --> 00:31:45,963
- This watch is still running.
- Oh, wow.

481
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:50,269
It has been running continuously
since the time that I received it.

482
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:53,607
This was taken off Timothy's wrist.

483
00:31:54,713 --> 00:31:57,807
Wow! There it is.

484
00:31:57,917 --> 00:32:01,717
It's still running. I can't even believe it.
I can't believe it.

485
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,219
I'm gonna wear it.

486
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:06,849
And I'm gonna remember him,
and I'm gonna remember Amie.

487
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:09,621
Can you speak about Amie?

488
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:15,600
Amie was brave
and Amie was strong.

489
00:32:15,701 --> 00:32:18,636
Amie was my friend
and she was Timothy's friend.

490
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:22,332
She was his girlfriend, but most important,
she was his friend.

491
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:23,931
And...

492
00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:30,114
And I believe that
I'm gonna honor their choice.

493
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:34,049
I'm always gonna respect them for
what they did, and for how they did it.

494
00:32:34,153 --> 00:32:37,554
And for being out there,
and for protecting bears

495
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:40,090
and living in wild nature.

496
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:43,389
And living their life to the fullest.

497
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:46,862
They truly died
doing what they lived for.

498
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,802
Representing Timothy.

499
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,871
And then I'll fill in the rest.
That's the specific number.

500
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:56,942
- So there it is.
- So there it is.

501
00:32:57,042 --> 00:33:00,205
Full circle. I've got it all.
I can't even believe it.

502
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:04,180
- Hopefully it will continue to run a long time.
- I think it will.

503
00:33:04,283 --> 00:33:05,750
Very good.

504
00:33:15,394 --> 00:33:17,294
It's the last thing that's left.

505
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:23,363
Thanks, Franc.

506
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:27,101
Jewel Palovak,

507
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:31,899
you were very close
to Timothy Treadwell.

508
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:34,912
Do you sometimes
feel like his widow?

509
00:33:35,948 --> 00:33:38,041
Do I feel like his widow?

510
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:42,810
Yeah, you know,
in some ways I do.

511
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:45,981
I feel like his widow because

512
00:33:46,091 --> 00:33:51,620
everything that he had,
everything that he worked for,

513
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,755
he left to me.

514
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:56,562
<i>I was his girlfriend</i>.

515
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:59,296
<i>I was his employee</i>.

516
00:33:59,405 --> 00:34:04,468
<i>I was the person that figured</i>
<i>all the last-minute details out</i>.

517
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:07,909
You also founded a foundation
with him?

518
00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:10,174
Yeah. We did.
We founded Gri<i>zz</i>ly People,

519
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:14,275
whose mission is to protect
and preserve habitat worldwide.

520
00:34:16,522 --> 00:34:20,652
<i>For Treadwell, who had</i>
<i>a natural tendency towards chaos,</i>

521
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:24,490
<i>Grizzly People served</i>
<i>as his organized platform,</i>

522
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:28,430
<i>and Jewel was his</i>
<i>most trusted co-combatant</i>.

523
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:31,733
<i>I met him in a restaurant</i>.

524
00:34:31,837 --> 00:34:34,362
<i>We both worked at this place</i>
<i>called Gulliver's</i>.

525
00:34:34,473 --> 00:34:37,442
<i>It was a prime rib restaurant</i>.
<i>It was huge and theatrical</i>.

526
00:34:37,543 --> 00:34:39,977
Timothy was a squire,
'cause it was set in the time...

527
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,309
It was based
on <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>.

528
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:45,406
He had a chint<i>z</i>y felt hat

529
00:34:45,517 --> 00:34:48,350
and a cheap plastic apron
and some knickers

530
00:34:48,454 --> 00:34:50,945
and that blond hair
just sticking out.

531
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:54,617
And me, I would be your English
serving wench for the evening.

532
00:34:54,726 --> 00:34:57,217
You had to toss the salad
with aplomb,

533
00:34:57,329 --> 00:35:00,423
and you had to boil the soup
and serve it to the people.

534
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:03,467
I had seen Timothy,
and he was kind of fun.

535
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:05,560
I didn't really know who he was.

536
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:07,662
And one night, I just wasn't
in the best of moods.

537
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:10,742
I had a huge table.
A family of people that wanted me

538
00:35:10,843 --> 00:35:13,903
to make it the best dining experience
of their life.

539
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:17,743
Do it up big. Make the soup big, you know.
Use the vernacular.

540
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:22,150
There was grandmas and babies
and hairdos and coats.

541
00:35:22,254 --> 00:35:25,917
So I thought, "You know what? I'll make it.
I'll make it big for ya.

542
00:35:26,024 --> 00:35:29,585
I'll make it really big.
You'll never forget this birthday."

543
00:35:29,695 --> 00:35:32,687
So, one of the parts
was you'd take the soup cart,

544
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:36,290
and you'd light it up with this gas
so that the soup was bubbling and boiling.

545
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:38,460
You could smell
the deliciousness.

546
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:41,232
And I decided to make it
really big.

547
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,832
So I trailed a little bit
extra of the lighter fluid

548
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:46,911
around the polyester cloth,

549
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:51,676
and I kind of miscalculated
because the soup exploded.

550
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:55,014
The people screamed,
the fire went everywhere.

551
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,214
So I was called into the office
in the next couple of days.

552
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:01,622
And who do I see
when I sit down in the office,

553
00:36:01,727 --> 00:36:05,288
waiting like you're in the jail or
you're in the principal's office?

554
00:36:05,397 --> 00:36:07,456
I see Timothy Treadwell.

555
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:10,626
I was like, "Hey, How are you?
I know I've seen you. I'm Jewel."

556
00:36:10,736 --> 00:36:13,204
He said, "I'm Tim."
I said, "What are you in for?"

557
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:16,001
He said, "I'm in for walking funny
in the dining room."

558
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:18,474
He said, "What did you do?"
I said, "I lit the soup cart on fire."

559
00:36:18,577 --> 00:36:22,274
He said, "That was you?"
And you know,

560
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:26,044
it wasn't love at first sight,
but it was certainly kindred spirits.

561
00:36:27,386 --> 00:36:31,322
Only Timmy is the boss
of all foxes and all bears.

562
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:33,448
You're their ruler.

563
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:35,459
Look at that face.

564
00:36:36,762 --> 00:36:39,230
Hey, thanks for being my friend.

565
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:42,732
This is so good.
Does that feel good?

566
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:46,330
We patrol the Gri<i>zz</i>ly Sanctuary together.
How did we meet?

567
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:49,601
Over a decade ago.
He left his mother and father's side,

568
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:53,235
promptly peed on my shoes,
pooped on my clothes, that was it.

569
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:57,577
<i>He was my friend. Timmy, the fox. Yep</i>.
<i>And we watch over things</i>.

570
00:36:57,683 --> 00:37:00,447
<i>And he's the boss</i>.
<i>Takes care of everything</i>.

571
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:03,749
<i>Yep, yep. He says,</i>
<i>"I love the way you pet."</i>

572
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:07,916
I think one of the things that's really important
is you can see the bond

573
00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:11,154
that has developed between
this very wild animal

574
00:37:11,263 --> 00:37:14,596
and this very,
fairly wild person.

575
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,691
And you reali<i>z</i>e
he has this gorgeous fur,

576
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:18,793
and people are trying
to kill him for it

577
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:21,873
with steel door traps
and cruel farming practices.

578
00:37:21,974 --> 00:37:24,636
And other people run him down
on horses for sport.

579
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:27,837
Fox hunting.
We want this to end.

580
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:31,677
Between Timmy, the fox, this beautiful fox,
and me, we ask the public,

581
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:37,085
please stop killing and hurting these foxes
and torturing them.

582
00:37:37,189 --> 00:37:38,850
Don't you think?

583
00:37:38,957 --> 00:37:41,323
If they knew how beautiful he was,
and how sweet he was,

584
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,451
they would never hurt him.

585
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:45,257
Thanks.

586
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:49,596
<i>Timothy used his camera as a tool</i>
<i>to get his message across</i>.

587
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:52,261
<i>Sometimes it was very playful</i>.

588
00:37:52,371 --> 00:37:56,068
Do another take here. I fucked up the last
one. Almost fell off the cliff.

589
00:37:56,174 --> 00:37:59,109
I'm a fucking asshole.

590
00:37:59,211 --> 00:38:01,441
Behind me is the Gri<i>zz</i>ly Sanctuary
and also behind me,

591
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:05,676
hidden down below in those trees somewhere,
is my camp.

592
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:09,242
I must stay incognito.
I must hide from the authorities.

593
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:11,754
I must hide from people
who would harm me.

594
00:38:11,857 --> 00:38:14,519
I must now hide from people
that seek me out

595
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:17,356
because I've made some sort of,

596
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:19,453
I don't want to say celebrity,

597
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:22,362
but they come to Alaska
and hear about Treadwell in the bush

598
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,492
and they want to go find him.

599
00:38:24,603 --> 00:38:26,901
Well, they can't.
I'm hidden down below.

600
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:30,372
No one knows where I am.
Even I don't know where I am.

601
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,102
That's pretty shitty.

602
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:34,576
Let's do a really short take here.

603
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,615
<i>But as a filmmaker,</i>
<i>he was methodical</i>.

604
00:38:37,716 --> 00:38:40,549
- Whatever.
- <i>Often repeating takes 15 times</i>.

605
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,745
One more really short,
excellent take.

606
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:47,848
Let's just really sum it up. Here we go.
This is gonna be the motherfucker.

607
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:51,554
Behind me is the Gri<i>zz</i>ly Sanctuary,
and also hidden below is my camp.

608
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:55,895
For I must now remain hidden from the
authorities, from people who would harm me,

609
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:58,162
from people who would
seek me out as a story.

610
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:00,568
My future helping the animals
depends on it.

611
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:03,505
I must be a spirit
in the wilderness.

612
00:39:05,944 --> 00:39:08,674
<i>With himself as the central character,</i>

613
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,271
<i>he began to craft his own movie,</i>

614
00:39:11,383 --> 00:39:14,716
<i>something way beyond</i>
<i>the wildlife film</i>.

615
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,220
There is going to be a number of takes
I'm gonna do.

616
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:19,222
These are called
"Wild Timmy Jungle Scenes."

617
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:21,451
We're gonna do
several takes of each

618
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,927
where I'll do it with a bandanna on,
maybe a bandanna off.

619
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,998
Maybe two different
colored bandannas.

620
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:28,726
Some without a bandanna,

621
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:31,564
some with the camera
being held.

622
00:39:34,172 --> 00:39:37,938
I kind of stumbled.
Let's do it again.

623
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:42,503
So the basic deal is that this stuff
could be cut into a show later on,

624
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:47,551
but who knows what look I had, whether
I had the black bandanna or no bandanna.

625
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:51,053
Very rarely the camo one,
but I like the camo look.

626
00:39:54,526 --> 00:39:58,053
Both cameras rolling. Both cameras rolling.
Both cameras rolling!

627
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:03,058
Sexy green bandanna,
last take of the evening.

628
00:40:03,168 --> 00:40:05,102
I'm on my way to the creek.
I need to get water.

629
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:09,503
And there's a super-duper low tide.
Full moon tonight, and action.

630
00:40:09,608 --> 00:40:11,667
<i>In his action movie mode,</i>

631
00:40:11,777 --> 00:40:14,109
<i>Treadwell probably did not realize</i>

632
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:19,616
<i>that seemingly empty moments</i>
<i>had a strange, secret beauty</i>.

633
00:40:19,718 --> 00:40:23,586
<i>Sometimes images themselves</i>
<i>developed their own life,</i>

634
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:26,657
<i>their own mysterious stardom</i>.

635
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:40,500
Starsky and Hutch. Over.

636
00:40:44,509 --> 00:40:46,409
<i>Beyond his posings,</i>

637
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:50,174
<i>the camera was his only</i>
<i>present companion</i>.

638
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:54,150
<i>It was his instrument to explore</i>
<i>the wilderness around him,</i>

639
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:58,154
<i>but increasingly</i>
<i>it became something more</i>.

640
00:40:58,256 --> 00:41:01,521
<i>He started to scrutinize</i>
<i>his innermost being,</i>

641
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:05,153
<i>his demons,</i>
<i>his exhilarations</i>.

642
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:10,200
<i>Facing the lens of a camera took</i>
<i>on the quality of a confessional</i>.

643
00:41:13,371 --> 00:41:15,430
<i>Covering various years,</i>

644
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:19,306
<i>the following samples illustrate</i>
<i>the search for himself</i>.

645
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:22,947
If there... I have no idea
if there's a God.

646
00:41:23,048 --> 00:41:26,245
But if there's a God, God would
be very, very... pleased with me.

647
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:28,546
If he could just watch me here,
how much I love them,

648
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:32,350
how much I adore them,
how respectful I am to them.

649
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:34,357
How I am one of them.

650
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:38,054
And how the studies they give me,
the photographs, the video...

651
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:40,825
And take that around
for no charge

652
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:43,594
to people around the world.

653
00:41:43,702 --> 00:41:47,103
It's good work. I feel good about it.
I feel good about myself doing it.

654
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:51,642
And I want to continue, and I hope I can.
I really hope I can.

655
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:54,803
But if not, be warned.

656
00:41:54,913 --> 00:41:58,872
I will die for these animals. I will die for
these animals. I will die for these animals.

657
00:41:58,984 --> 00:42:01,282
Thank you so much
for letting me do this.

658
00:42:01,386 --> 00:42:05,482
Thank you so much for these animals,
for giving me a life.

659
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:09,458
I had no life.
Now I have a life.

660
00:42:16,968 --> 00:42:18,936
Now, enough of that.

661
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:23,370
Now let the expedition continue.
It's off to Timmy, the fox.

662
00:42:23,475 --> 00:42:25,773
We've gotta find Banjo.
He's missing!

663
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:28,243
And that's my story here,

664
00:42:28,346 --> 00:42:30,940
for me, Timothy Treadwell,

665
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:33,244
the kind warrior.

666
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:35,819
Can I take it?

667
00:42:35,921 --> 00:42:37,786
I'm trying.

668
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:40,016
Okay, yeah, I can do it.

669
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:42,559
Yeah. Why not? Why not?

670
00:42:43,628 --> 00:42:45,960
I've crossed the halfway point.

671
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:49,795
Government's given me
all they have. So far.

672
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:52,199
I've stood up to it.

673
00:42:52,304 --> 00:42:55,762
I've had danger in the boat, almost died.
I've almost fallen off a cliff.

674
00:42:55,874 --> 00:42:59,310
Yeah. The danger factor's
about to amp up in the Ma<i>z</i>e.

675
00:42:59,411 --> 00:43:01,845
The Ma<i>z</i>e is always
the most dangerous.

676
00:43:02,981 --> 00:43:05,541
Lord, I do not want
to be hurt by a bear.

677
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,481
I do not.

678
00:43:07,586 --> 00:43:11,613
I always cannot understand why girls
don't wanna be with me for a long time,

679
00:43:11,723 --> 00:43:14,089
because I have really
a nice personality.

680
00:43:14,192 --> 00:43:16,126
I'm fun.

681
00:43:16,227 --> 00:43:19,719
I'm very, very good in the... You're not
supposed to say that when you're a guy.

682
00:43:19,831 --> 00:43:22,265
But I know I am.
They know I am.

683
00:43:22,367 --> 00:43:24,528
And...

684
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:30,531
I don't fight with them,
I'm so passive.

685
00:43:30,642 --> 00:43:32,542
Bit of a patsy!

686
00:43:32,644 --> 00:43:35,374
Is that a turnoff to girls,
to be a patsy?

687
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:39,280
I mean it's not... it's not
that I'm a total great guy.

688
00:43:39,384 --> 00:43:42,410
I'm a lot of fun
and have a good life going.

689
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,216
I don't know what's going on.

690
00:43:45,323 --> 00:43:48,190
I always wished I was gay.
Would've been a lot easier.

691
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:50,284
You know?
You can just "bing-bing-bing."

692
00:43:50,395 --> 00:43:54,297
Gay guys have no problem. I mean,
they go to restrooms and truck stops,

693
00:43:54,399 --> 00:43:56,959
and they perform sex.

694
00:43:57,068 --> 00:43:59,662
It's like so easy for 'em and stuff.

695
00:43:59,771 --> 00:44:03,969
But you know what?
Alas, Timothy Treadwell is not gay. Bummer!

696
00:44:04,075 --> 00:44:07,408
I love girls! And girls...

697
00:44:07,512 --> 00:44:09,810
Girls need a lot more...

698
00:44:09,914 --> 00:44:12,815
need a lot more, you know,

699
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:17,752
finesse and care,
and I like that a bit.

700
00:44:17,856 --> 00:44:20,222
But when it goes bad
and you're alone,

701
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:21,883
it's like...

702
00:44:22,927 --> 00:44:24,189
Well,

703
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:29,027
you know, you can't rebound
like you can if you were gay.

704
00:44:29,134 --> 00:44:31,068
I'm sure gay people
have problems too,

705
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:35,162
but not as much as one goofy straight guy
named Timothy Treadwell.

706
00:44:35,273 --> 00:44:38,674
Anyway, that's my story.
That's my story.

707
00:44:40,412 --> 00:44:43,609
I love you. Look at you.

708
00:44:43,715 --> 00:44:46,275
You're the best little fox.

709
00:44:46,384 --> 00:44:48,818
But how did I come
into this work, Iris?

710
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,785
Did you ever get the story?

711
00:44:50,889 --> 00:44:54,586
I was troubled. I was troubled.
I drank a lot.

712
00:44:54,693 --> 00:44:56,957
Did you know that?
You wouldn't even know what that is.

713
00:44:57,062 --> 00:45:01,465
But I used to drink
to the point of

714
00:45:01,566 --> 00:45:06,265
that I guess I was either gonna die
from it or break free of it.

715
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:10,307
But nothing, nothing, Iris,
could get me from... to stop drinking.

716
00:45:10,408 --> 00:45:14,003
Nothing! I went to programs.
I tried quitting myself.

717
00:45:14,112 --> 00:45:17,946
I did everything that I could
to try not to drink,

718
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:20,517
and then I did everything
I could to drink.

719
00:45:20,618 --> 00:45:23,018
And... And it was killing me

720
00:45:23,121 --> 00:45:26,113
until I discovered
this land of bears

721
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:29,557
<i>and realized that they were in</i>
<i>such great danger</i>

722
00:45:29,661 --> 00:45:33,062
<i>that they needed a caretaker, they needed</i>
<i>someone to look after them</i>.

723
00:45:33,164 --> 00:45:35,325
<i>But not a drunk person</i>.
<i>Not a person messed up</i>.

724
00:45:35,433 --> 00:45:39,802
<i>So I promised the bears</i>
<i>that if I would look over them,</i>

725
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:44,773
<i>would they please help me</i>
<i>be a better person and</i>

726
00:45:44,876 --> 00:45:47,709
they've become so inspirational,

727
00:45:47,812 --> 00:45:50,576
and living with the foxes too,

728
00:45:50,682 --> 00:45:52,616
that I did, I gave up the drinking.

729
00:45:52,717 --> 00:45:54,617
It was a miracle.
It was an absolute miracle.

730
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:58,280
And the miracle was animals.
The miracle was animals.

731
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:06,052
I live here. It's very dangerous.
It's really dangerous.

732
00:46:06,164 --> 00:46:08,997
I run wild with the bears.
I run so wild, so free,

733
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:13,059
so like a child
with these animals.

734
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:17,335
It's really cool.
And it's very serious.

735
00:46:18,676 --> 00:46:21,008
<i>I'm here alone,</i>
<i>and when you're all alone</i>

736
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:23,842
<i>you do get</i>... <i>you get lonely</i>.

737
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:26,815
<i>Oh, duhl Right?</i>
<i>You get pretty lonely</i>.

738
00:46:31,923 --> 00:46:35,723
Oh, no. I'm gonna do all this stuff because
I'm supposed to be alone.

739
00:46:35,827 --> 00:46:37,158
Oh. Okay.

740
00:46:39,531 --> 00:46:41,522
<i>Part of the mythical character</i>

741
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:44,067
<i>Treadwell was transforming</i>
<i>himself into</i>

742
00:46:44,169 --> 00:46:48,833
<i>required him to be seen</i>
<i>as being completely alone</i>.

743
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:52,467
<i>He was mostly alone,</i>
<i>but he did spend time with women</i>

744
00:46:52,577 --> 00:46:55,375
<i>who will here</i>
<i>remain anonymous</i>.

745
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,846
<i>The truth is that</i>
<i>Amie Huguenard</i>

746
00:46:57,949 --> 00:47:01,146
<i>accompanied him for parts</i>
<i>of his last two summers</i>.

747
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:04,881
<i>A fact which was out of step</i>
<i>with his stylization</i>

748
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:07,981
<i>as the lone guardian</i>
<i>of the grizzlies</i>.

749
00:47:10,595 --> 00:47:15,328
It's July 26, and I've been dropped off
all alone again here in the Gri<i>zz</i>ly Ma<i>z</i>e.

750
00:47:15,433 --> 00:47:18,527
And it's always such a surreal
feeling as the plane takes off.

751
00:47:18,636 --> 00:47:22,595
And it doesn't quite sink
into you just how alone you are.

752
00:47:22,707 --> 00:47:24,698
That for the next
two months or more

753
00:47:24,809 --> 00:47:27,175
you will be alone
in this wild wilderness,

754
00:47:27,278 --> 00:47:31,078
this jungle that the bears
have carved tunnels through.

755
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:33,275
And that's the Gri<i>zz</i>ly Ma<i>z</i>e.

756
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:35,818
It's July 26.
I hope to survive

757
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,650
and to be able to record
the secret world of the bears.

758
00:47:38,756 --> 00:47:42,214
And come September when people
might come to harm these animals,

759
00:47:42,327 --> 00:47:45,125
I'll look after them,
I'll make sure they're safe.

760
00:47:50,268 --> 00:47:53,795
It is so weird, though,
when it sinks in,

761
00:47:53,905 --> 00:47:56,339
how alone you are.

762
00:48:00,812 --> 00:48:05,875
<i>Amie Huguenard remains</i>
<i>a great unknown of this film</i>.

763
00:48:05,984 --> 00:48:08,953
<i>Her family declined</i>
<i>to appear on camera,</i>

764
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:12,989
<i>and Amie herself remains hidden</i>
<i>in Treadwell's footage</i>.

765
00:48:13,091 --> 00:48:15,992
<i>In nearly 100 hours</i>
<i>of his video,</i>

766
00:48:16,094 --> 00:48:19,427
<i>she appears</i>
<i>exactly two times</i>.

767
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:24,627
<i>Here disembarking from the plane</i>
<i>in the year of her death</i>.

768
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:26,499
<i>We never see her face</i>.

769
00:48:26,604 --> 00:48:30,335
<i>Here it is obscured</i>
<i>by her hands and her hair</i>.

770
00:48:30,441 --> 00:48:32,932
Greetings, children of America.

771
00:48:35,113 --> 00:48:39,015
<i>The second shot that we have</i>
<i>doesn't show her face either</i>.

772
00:48:39,117 --> 00:48:42,609
<i>She remains a mystery,</i>
<i>veiled by a mosquito net,</i>

773
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,688
<i>obscured, unknown</i>.

774
00:48:46,758 --> 00:48:48,749
<i>Only through Treadwell's diaries</i>

775
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:51,988
<i>do we know that</i>
<i>she was frightened of bears</i>.

776
00:48:57,568 --> 00:49:00,401
<i>The only other hint</i>
<i>we have of her presence</i>

777
00:49:00,505 --> 00:49:02,871
<i>is this shot here of Treadwell</i>.

778
00:49:02,974 --> 00:49:05,807
<i>It is handheld,</i>
<i>and we can only deduct</i>

779
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:09,311
<i>it must have been Amie</i>
<i>operating the camera</i>.

780
00:49:18,957 --> 00:49:21,824
Timothy Treadwell
and Amie Huguenard's remains

781
00:49:21,926 --> 00:49:24,224
came in this large metal can.

782
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:29,125
Inside this metal can
was a plastic bag,

783
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:31,793
one for Timothy, and one for Amie.

784
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:36,237
I mean, these are human beings.
And the question I ask is first of all:

785
00:49:36,341 --> 00:49:38,309
Who are you, Timothy?

786
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:41,708
Who are you, Amie?
And what happened to you?

787
00:49:41,813 --> 00:49:46,341
In the case of Timothy and Amie,
what I had were body parts.

788
00:49:46,451 --> 00:49:49,852
Just the visual input of seeing

789
00:49:49,954 --> 00:49:53,355
a detached human being
before my eyes

790
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:57,485
makes my heart race, makes
the hair stand up on the back of my head.

791
00:49:57,595 --> 00:50:01,292
Particularly in combination
with the contents of a tape,

792
00:50:01,399 --> 00:50:05,631
an audiotape that is the sound portion
of the videotape.

793
00:50:05,737 --> 00:50:08,604
And when I find out
from other investigators

794
00:50:08,706 --> 00:50:12,506
that the shoes neatly placed
at the entrance to a tent,

795
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:15,408
and the cap left
on a camera so that

796
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:18,505
the visual part
could not be recorded,

797
00:50:18,616 --> 00:50:23,553
yet the tape is running so that we can
hear the sounds of Amie screaming

798
00:50:23,654 --> 00:50:27,454
and the sounds
of Timothy moaning,

799
00:50:27,558 --> 00:50:30,391
tells me that this event
occurred very, very quickly,

800
00:50:30,495 --> 00:50:32,520
suddenly and unexpectedly.

801
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:37,693
I clearly can hear her screaming,
"Stop" and "Go away."

802
00:50:37,802 --> 00:50:41,294
Maybe "Run away."
There's a lot of background noise.

803
00:50:41,406 --> 00:50:42,964
Timothy is moaning.

804
00:50:43,074 --> 00:50:48,410
And I hear Amie beating on the top
of this bear's head with a frying pan.

805
00:50:48,513 --> 00:50:52,711
And Timothy is saying,
"Run away. Let go!

806
00:50:52,817 --> 00:50:57,584
Run away. Run away, Amie.
Run away."

807
00:50:57,688 --> 00:51:00,885
Amie had a great deal
of conviction.

808
00:51:00,992 --> 00:51:05,326
She had a great deal of conviction
in this relationship. We know that.

809
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:08,922
Although in the past,
she was more standoffish.

810
00:51:09,033 --> 00:51:12,696
She didn't get as close
to the bear as Timothy did.

811
00:51:12,804 --> 00:51:15,329
She was more cautious.

812
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,898
However, I know,
that at the moment of death,

813
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:24,209
when one is being tried
to the maximum of one's ability

814
00:51:24,315 --> 00:51:28,752
to be faithful,
to stick to a situation,

815
00:51:28,853 --> 00:51:31,981
to be loyal, if one can say that,
to Timothy,

816
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:35,526
she stayed there,
and she fought with Timothy.

817
00:51:35,626 --> 00:51:37,685
She did not run away.

818
00:51:37,795 --> 00:51:42,129
Amie, we know, fought back
for approximately six minutes.

819
00:51:42,233 --> 00:51:47,261
Amie stayed with her lover,

820
00:51:47,371 --> 00:51:50,499
with her partner, with her mate,

821
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:52,542
and with the bear.

822
00:51:52,643 --> 00:51:57,842
Ultimately she stayed
with the bear in the situation.

823
00:52:14,132 --> 00:52:16,532
<i>This is Timothy's camera</i>.

824
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:18,431
<i>During the fatal attack,</i>

825
00:52:18,536 --> 00:52:21,733
<i>there was no time</i>
<i>to remove the lens cap</i>.

826
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:25,866
<i>Jewel Palovak allowed me</i>
<i>to listen to the audio</i>.

827
00:52:30,548 --> 00:52:32,778
I hear rain, and I hear Amie,

828
00:52:32,884 --> 00:52:36,047
"Get away! Get away!
Go away!"

829
00:52:58,075 --> 00:53:00,100
Can you turn it off?

830
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:21,490
Jewel, you must never
listen to this.

831
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:25,865
I know, Werner.
I'm never going to.

832
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:29,770
And you must never look at the photos
I've seen at the coroner's office.

833
00:53:29,874 --> 00:53:32,900
- I will never look at them.
- Yeah.

834
00:53:38,516 --> 00:53:41,485
They said it was bad.

835
00:53:44,188 --> 00:53:47,783
Now you know why
no one's gonna hear it.

836
00:53:52,663 --> 00:53:56,224
I think you, you should not keep it.
You should destroy it.

837
00:53:56,334 --> 00:53:59,462
- Yeah.
- I think that's what you should do.

838
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:00,594
Okay.

839
00:54:00,705 --> 00:54:04,607
Because it will be the white elephant
in your room all your life.

840
00:57:04,388 --> 00:57:06,322
Here I am at the scene
of the fight.

841
00:57:06,424 --> 00:57:09,086
It looks as if tractors tore
the land up,

842
00:57:09,193 --> 00:57:11,388
raked it, rototilled it,
tossed it about.

843
00:57:11,495 --> 00:57:14,794
There is fur everywhere, and in the camera
foreground excreted waste.

844
00:57:14,899 --> 00:57:17,834
In the middle of the fight
so violent, so upsetting

845
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:21,200
that Sergeant Brown
went to the bathroom,

846
00:57:21,305 --> 00:57:24,832
did a number two during his fight.

847
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:28,537
Extremely emotional,
extremely powerful.

848
00:57:28,646 --> 00:57:31,513
And yet, both bears
back in pursuit of Saturn,

849
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:35,608
including Mickey, who appears
to have gotten the worse for the wear

850
00:57:35,719 --> 00:57:38,847
in the fight between
Sergeant Brown and Mickey

851
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:43,325
for the right to court Saturn,
the queen of the Gri<i>zz</i>ly Sanctuary.

852
00:57:43,427 --> 00:57:45,486
Ama<i>z</i>ing.

853
00:57:45,596 --> 00:57:48,588
Oh, Mickey, I love you. And Mickey's
now the closest bear to Saturn.

854
00:57:48,699 --> 00:57:52,157
Back in like a horse in a race
that does not give up.

855
00:57:52,269 --> 00:57:55,238
We love that bear. Mickey!
We love him! We love him.

856
00:57:55,339 --> 00:57:58,433
But, Mickey,
I've been down that street.

857
00:57:58,542 --> 00:58:00,806
You don't always get the chick you want.
Let me tell you.

858
00:58:00,911 --> 00:58:03,379
It doesn't always often work out.

859
00:58:03,481 --> 00:58:05,381
Hey, he's after my own heart.

860
00:58:05,483 --> 00:58:08,281
He don't give up,
even when it looks shitty.

861
00:58:08,385 --> 00:58:11,320
All right, love you, Mickey.
Love you, Mickey.

862
00:58:18,262 --> 00:58:21,459
I just wanna discuss that fight
with Mickey bear right here.

863
00:58:21,565 --> 00:58:23,931
He's right next to me here
in the Gri<i>zz</i>ly Sanctuary on the tide fly.

864
00:58:24,034 --> 00:58:26,229
Saturn off to camera left.

865
00:58:26,337 --> 00:58:31,502
Mick, you underestimated Sergeant Brown.
You went in for the head.

866
00:58:31,609 --> 00:58:34,305
He seemed to be rope-a-doping you
like he wasn't that tough.

867
00:58:34,411 --> 00:58:37,107
And then once you
banged into him,

868
00:58:37,214 --> 00:58:40,411
man, he turned out to be
one heck of a rough bear,

869
00:58:40,518 --> 00:58:42,213
a very rough bear.

870
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:46,016
I was so scared, I almost got sick
to my stomach watching you fight.

871
00:58:46,123 --> 00:58:48,921
Then when he knocked you down
and you were down on your back,

872
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:52,325
it was terrible,
it was terrible!

873
00:58:52,429 --> 00:58:54,693
I'm not duking it out for any girl like that.
I'm telling you right now.

874
00:58:54,798 --> 00:58:57,892
I'm not duking it out
for any girl, but l...

875
00:58:58,002 --> 00:59:00,493
Well, I've had my troubles
with the girls. Yeah, yeah.

876
00:59:00,604 --> 00:59:03,198
And I'll tell you something.
If Saturn was a female human...

877
00:59:03,307 --> 00:59:06,401
I can just see how beautiful
she is as a bear.

878
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:10,344
I've always called her the Michelle Pfeiffer
of bears out here.

879
00:59:12,082 --> 00:59:14,448
All right, you lay there.
I'm gonna go off with your girlfriend.

880
00:59:14,552 --> 00:59:16,452
Don't beat me up over it.

881
00:59:16,554 --> 00:59:19,614
I'm cool, I'm cool. I'm respectful.

882
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:21,953
Things are bad for me
with the human women,

883
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:24,254
but not so bad that I have
to be hitting on bears yet.

884
00:59:24,361 --> 00:59:26,454
Okay? Okay.

885
00:59:29,767 --> 00:59:31,394
<i>In his diaries,</i>

886
00:59:31,502 --> 00:59:36,064
<i>Treadwell speaks often of the human world</i>
<i>as something foreign</i>.

887
00:59:36,173 --> 00:59:40,269
<i>He made a clear distinction between</i>
<i>the bears and the people's world</i>

888
00:59:40,377 --> 00:59:43,710
<i>which moved further and further</i>
<i>into the distance</i>.

889
00:59:45,549 --> 00:59:50,486
<i>Wild, primordial nature was</i>
<i>where he felt truly at home</i>.

890
00:59:54,792 --> 00:59:59,957
<i>We explored the glacier in the back country</i>
<i>of his Grizzly Sanctuary</i>.

891
01:00:00,064 --> 01:00:04,228
<i>This gigantic complexity</i>
<i>of tumbling ice and abysses</i>

892
01:00:04,335 --> 01:00:07,668
<i>separated Treadwell</i>
<i>from the world out there</i>.

893
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:12,470
<i>And more so, it seems to me</i>
<i>that this landscape in turmoil</i>

894
01:00:12,576 --> 01:00:15,067
<i>is a metaphor of his soul</i>.

895
01:00:26,357 --> 01:00:30,225
<i>Off there in the distance</i>
<i>is his bay and his campsite</i>

896
01:00:30,327 --> 01:00:32,727
<i>where he battled his demons</i>.

897
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:37,832
<i>What drove Timothy</i>
<i>into the wild?</i>

898
01:00:38,102 --> 01:00:41,401
<i>We visited his parents</i>
<i>in Florida</i>.

899
01:00:43,907 --> 01:00:47,035
<i>Timothy grew up with</i>
<i>four siblings in Long Island</i>

900
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:49,203
<i>in a solid middle-class family</i>

901
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:53,010
<i>where the father worked as the foreman</i>
<i>of a construction team</i>

902
01:00:53,117 --> 01:00:55,847
<i>for a telephone company</i>.

903
01:00:55,953 --> 01:00:58,421
<i>There must have been</i>
<i>an urge to escape</i>

904
01:00:58,522 --> 01:01:02,856
<i>the safety of</i>
<i>his protected environment</i>.

905
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:07,294
<i>I was moved to find that among</i>
<i>all memorabilia in the house,</i>

906
01:01:07,398 --> 01:01:10,799
<i>his mother was clutching</i>
<i>Timothy's favorite bear</i>.

907
01:01:10,901 --> 01:01:14,462
This has been to Alaska
many times.

908
01:01:14,571 --> 01:01:17,301
I'm sure he loved it
to the end, you know?

909
01:01:17,408 --> 01:01:21,344
It's just... his childhood toy.

910
01:01:21,445 --> 01:01:26,041
<i>Tim's childhood pointed towards</i>
<i>nothing extraordinary</i>.

911
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:28,641
A normal everyday kid.

912
01:01:28,752 --> 01:01:33,052
Never any trouble in school.
Always a good student.

913
01:01:33,157 --> 01:01:35,489
Not an "A" student,
a "B" student.

914
01:01:35,592 --> 01:01:40,029
And got along great
with kids and animals.

915
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:43,190
<i>Him and I were extremely connected</i>
<i>to animals in the house</i>.

916
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:45,996
<i>I think more so</i>
<i>than anybody else</i>.

917
01:01:47,404 --> 01:01:49,702
<i>This squirrel named Willie</i>

918
01:01:49,807 --> 01:01:52,708
<i>became Timothy's best friend</i>.

919
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:55,938
<i>Teddy bears meant a lot to him</i>.

920
01:01:56,046 --> 01:02:01,279
<i>He seemed to develop into</i>
<i>an all-American boy, handsome,</i>

921
01:02:01,418 --> 01:02:04,581
<i>athletic, full of promise</i>.

922
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:10,220
<i>He excelled on</i>
<i>his high school swim team</i>.

923
01:02:10,327 --> 01:02:15,287
<i>He went to Bradley University</i>
<i>on a diving scholarship</i>.

924
01:02:15,399 --> 01:02:19,130
I think he started drinking
out there and having,

925
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:21,568
you know, just hanging out
with the wrong people.

926
01:02:21,672 --> 01:02:24,140
Then he injured his back.
And he ended up

927
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:27,836
losing his scholarship
and coming back home.

928
01:02:27,945 --> 01:02:31,312
He did attempt to smoke
marijuana in the house.

929
01:02:31,415 --> 01:02:33,406
Yeah, he did.

930
01:02:33,517 --> 01:02:35,280
But I put the kibosh on that.

931
01:02:35,385 --> 01:02:38,047
But obviously he was
doing it elsewhere, so...

932
01:02:38,155 --> 01:02:42,091
He really wanted a new start,
a fresh start.

933
01:02:42,192 --> 01:02:46,492
So when he went out to California,
he was 19 or 20.

934
01:02:46,597 --> 01:02:50,863
He wasn't a young 15 or 16-year-old.
He was of age.

935
01:02:50,968 --> 01:02:56,235
He'd gotten a job just to make money
on the Queen Mary at the gift shop.

936
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:59,070
He did hire an agent.

937
01:02:59,176 --> 01:03:04,478
He did change his name
to Treadwell to be theatrical.

938
01:03:04,581 --> 01:03:07,175
And it was a family name.

939
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:12,279
I know he got on

940
01:03:12,389 --> 01:03:14,482
<i>Love Connection</i>
<i>with Chuck Woolery</i>.

941
01:03:14,591 --> 01:03:17,992
I think he got on another show.

942
01:03:18,095 --> 01:03:21,428
There were promises made
that never came true.

943
01:03:21,532 --> 01:03:24,023
And he tested with the actors

944
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:27,797
to get the bartender job
on <i>Cheers</i>.

945
01:03:27,905 --> 01:03:32,433
And allegedly he came in second
to Woody Harrelson.

946
01:03:32,543 --> 01:03:35,137
How close a second?
I don't know.

947
01:03:35,245 --> 01:03:38,214
But that is what
really destroyed him.

948
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:41,910
That he did not get
that job on <i>Cheers</i>.

949
01:03:44,087 --> 01:03:46,419
He spiraled down.

950
01:03:50,127 --> 01:03:52,925
Timmy used to body surf out here.

951
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:57,467
He had a boogie board
with the Union Jack on it.

952
01:03:57,568 --> 01:04:01,436
And he was totally fearless.

953
01:04:01,538 --> 01:04:04,735
The ama<i>z</i>ing thing about Timmy
was he did...

954
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:07,402
He had this Prince Valiant haircut.

955
01:04:07,511 --> 01:04:11,311
And he could surf
and go under water,

956
01:04:11,415 --> 01:04:15,784
and yet still that hair would hide
his receding hairline.

957
01:04:15,886 --> 01:04:18,150
It was the most
ama<i>z</i>ing thing I'd ever seen.

958
01:04:18,255 --> 01:04:20,416
No matter how rough the surf,

959
01:04:20,524 --> 01:04:22,685
you never saw Timmy's forehead.

960
01:04:22,793 --> 01:04:24,852
I don't know how he did that.

961
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:28,159
How's the hair look?

962
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,759
<i>At some point in Timmy's life,</i>

963
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:34,463
he had a near fatal overdose.

964
01:04:34,571 --> 01:04:37,472
How he survived it,
I don't know.

965
01:04:37,574 --> 01:04:39,565
He was a tough guy.

966
01:04:39,676 --> 01:04:41,940
But I guess it was
an epiphany for him.

967
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:46,539
After that he was looking
for a different persona.

968
01:04:48,619 --> 01:04:51,554
I guess that's when
he came up with

969
01:04:51,655 --> 01:04:55,091
where he was from
and his delightful accent.

970
01:04:55,192 --> 01:04:56,921
<i>I never questioned it</i>.

971
01:04:57,928 --> 01:05:01,125
<i>Treadwell's need to invent</i>
<i>a new persona for himself</i>

972
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:03,995
<i>led him to elaborate</i>
<i>fabrications</i>.

973
01:05:04,101 --> 01:05:06,797
<i>He claimed to be an orphan</i>
<i>from Australia,</i>

974
01:05:06,904 --> 01:05:11,136
<i>and even checked out details</i>
<i>of a small town in the Australian outback</i>

975
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:14,074
<i>in order to sound convincing</i>.

976
01:05:14,177 --> 01:05:17,669
<i>His accent, though,</i>
<i>remained suspicious</i>.

977
01:05:17,781 --> 01:05:21,512
<i>It almost sounded more Kennedy-esque</i>
<i>than Australian</i>.

978
01:05:21,618 --> 01:05:24,348
After Timmy's death,

979
01:05:24,454 --> 01:05:29,858
people said, "Well, don't you feel
betrayed that he did that?

980
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:33,760
That he didn't tell you the truth
about his accent or his origins?"

981
01:05:34,998 --> 01:05:36,932
And that never bothered me.

982
01:05:37,034 --> 01:05:39,366
Timmy always amused me.

983
01:05:39,469 --> 01:05:41,403
There's an old saying
on the farm,

984
01:05:41,505 --> 01:05:44,633
"If it doesn't scare the cows,
who cares?"

985
01:05:44,741 --> 01:05:48,006
Well, I don't think
Timmy ever scared the cows,

986
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:50,102
so who cares?

987
01:05:50,213 --> 01:05:53,944
He was troubled.
I mean, it...

988
01:05:55,819 --> 01:05:58,344
One time he went to a doctor.

989
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:01,947
They wanted to put him on some kind
of an antidepressant or something

990
01:06:02,059 --> 01:06:05,961
to keep his mood, 'cause his moods
were so up and down.

991
01:06:06,063 --> 01:06:09,999
And he started taking it for a while,
and then he stopped.

992
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:12,159
He said, "I had to stop."
I said, "Why?"

993
01:06:12,269 --> 01:06:17,138
He said, "Because I can't stop.
I can't have the middle grounds.

994
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,470
I have to have the highs
and the lows.

995
01:06:19,576 --> 01:06:21,976
It's a part of my life,
it's a part of my personality."

996
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:24,343
He definitely had a dark side.

997
01:06:24,448 --> 01:06:29,647
He was mixed up in drugs which makes you
mixed up in bad people, people with guns.

998
01:06:29,753 --> 01:06:34,315
Timothy always had a sense of justice
that was his own.

999
01:06:34,424 --> 01:06:38,622
So he got into a lot,
a lot of trouble.

1000
01:06:38,729 --> 01:06:40,629
I think that...

1001
01:06:40,731 --> 01:06:42,631
How dangerous?

1002
01:06:42,733 --> 01:06:44,530
How dangerous? I mean...

1003
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:49,266
I don't think he would've ever...
He couldn't have ever killed anybody.

1004
01:06:49,373 --> 01:06:52,399
He always kept it in check. One thing
that we did every once in a while

1005
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:55,569
which just seems so bi<i>z</i>arre
by now, but it's...

1006
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:58,375
We would go, when we lived in the Valley,
to the Van Nuys courthouse.

1007
01:06:58,482 --> 01:07:01,918
We would watch when criminals
were being sentenced.

1008
01:07:02,019 --> 01:07:04,783
We would watch people
getting their sentence.

1009
01:07:04,888 --> 01:07:08,517
And I think we did it...
I did it just for shock value,

1010
01:07:08,625 --> 01:07:10,616
and because it was something
I had never done.

1011
01:07:10,727 --> 01:07:14,322
But he did it, I think,
to remind him

1012
01:07:14,431 --> 01:07:18,891
if he went to that dark place,
what his life would be.

1013
01:07:21,104 --> 01:07:23,038
I'm in love
with my animal friends.

1014
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:26,507
I'm in love with my animal friends!
In love with my animal friends.

1015
01:07:26,610 --> 01:07:29,044
I'm very, very troubled.

1016
01:07:35,318 --> 01:07:37,286
It's very emotional.

1017
01:07:38,588 --> 01:07:41,250
It's probably not cool
even looking like this.

1018
01:07:41,358 --> 01:07:46,489
I'm so in love with them, and they're
so f-ed over, which so sucks.

1019
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:51,495
Do you know you're the star
for all the children.

1020
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:57,272
They love you. And I love you so much,
and thank you.

1021
01:07:59,810 --> 01:08:02,404
Thank you for being my friend.

1022
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:13,084
Isn't this... so sad?

1023
01:08:14,191 --> 01:08:17,388
This is a bumblebee

1024
01:08:17,494 --> 01:08:21,260
who expired as it was working

1025
01:08:21,364 --> 01:08:25,095
at doing the pollen thing
on this Alaskan fireweed.

1026
01:08:25,202 --> 01:08:30,139
And it just is... Just has
really touched me to no end.

1027
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:34,700
It was doing its duty,
it was flying around.

1028
01:08:34,811 --> 01:08:40,408
Working busy as a bee,
and it died right there.

1029
01:08:40,517 --> 01:08:43,452
It's beautiful, it's sad,
it's tragic.

1030
01:08:43,553 --> 01:08:45,748
I love that bee.

1031
01:08:48,492 --> 01:08:50,585
Well, the bee moved.

1032
01:08:52,362 --> 01:08:54,421
Was it sleeping?

1033
01:09:11,348 --> 01:09:13,248
There's your poop.

1034
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:16,812
It just came out of her butt.

1035
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:19,718
I can feel it.

1036
01:09:21,858 --> 01:09:24,793
I can feel the poop.

1037
01:09:24,895 --> 01:09:27,887
It's warm.
It just came from her butt.

1038
01:09:28,965 --> 01:09:30,956
This was just inside of her.

1039
01:09:31,067 --> 01:09:33,228
My girl.

1040
01:09:33,336 --> 01:09:35,236
I'm touching it.

1041
01:09:36,406 --> 01:09:38,169
It's her poop.
It's Wendy's poop.

1042
01:09:38,275 --> 01:09:42,974
I know it may seem weird that I touched
her poop, but it was inside of her.

1043
01:09:43,079 --> 01:09:46,139
It's what... It's her life!

1044
01:09:46,249 --> 01:09:48,444
It's her! And she's
so precious to me.

1045
01:09:48,552 --> 01:09:52,113
She gave me Downey.
Downey's... I adore Downey.

1046
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:56,186
Everything about them is perfect.

1047
01:09:56,293 --> 01:09:59,228
<i>Perfection belonged to the bears</i>.

1048
01:09:59,329 --> 01:10:02,162
<i>But once in a while,</i>
<i>Treadwell came face-to-face</i>

1049
01:10:02,265 --> 01:10:05,393
<i>with the harsh reality</i>
<i>of wild nature</i>.

1050
01:10:05,502 --> 01:10:08,471
<i>This did not fit into</i>
<i>his sentimentalized view</i>

1051
01:10:08,572 --> 01:10:10,699
<i>that everything out there</i>
<i>was good,</i>

1052
01:10:10,807 --> 01:10:14,743
<i>and the universe in balance</i>
<i>and in harmony</i>.

1053
01:10:14,844 --> 01:10:20,077
<i>Male bears sometimes kill cubs to stop</i>
<i>the females from lactating,</i>

1054
01:10:20,183 --> 01:10:23,949
<i>and thus have them ready again</i>
<i>for fornication</i>.

1055
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:37,499
Oh, God!

1056
01:10:38,902 --> 01:10:40,699
I love you.

1057
01:10:42,172 --> 01:10:44,936
I love you and I

1058
01:10:46,509 --> 01:10:48,909
don't understand.

1059
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:52,244
It's a painful world.

1060
01:10:52,349 --> 01:10:54,340
<i>Here I differ with Treadwell</i>.

1061
01:10:54,451 --> 01:10:58,649
<i>He seemed to ignore the fact that</i>
<i>in nature there are predators</i>.

1062
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:02,919
<i>I believe the common denominator</i>
<i>of the universe is not harmony,</i>

1063
01:11:03,026 --> 01:11:06,792
<i>but chaos, hostility and murder</i>.

1064
01:11:06,896 --> 01:11:08,796
He wandered too far
from the den.

1065
01:11:08,898 --> 01:11:11,924
And the wolves last night
that I heard howling,

1066
01:11:12,035 --> 01:11:15,061
screeching in glee
and excitement,

1067
01:11:15,171 --> 01:11:19,164
it was over the termination
of one of the babies.

1068
01:11:19,276 --> 01:11:22,404
This Expedition 2001
has taken a sad turn,

1069
01:11:22,512 --> 01:11:24,446
but it is a real turn.

1070
01:11:24,547 --> 01:11:28,711
And I mourn the death
of this gorgeous baby fox.

1071
01:11:28,818 --> 01:11:30,786
Good-bye, little fox.

1072
01:11:34,357 --> 01:11:37,121
Get out of his eye,
you friggin' fly!

1073
01:11:37,227 --> 01:11:40,958
Don't do it when I'm around.
Have some respect, you fucker.

1074
01:11:41,264 --> 01:11:43,425
<i>Most disturbing for him</i>

1075
01:11:43,533 --> 01:11:46,502
<i>was to find the skull</i>
<i>of a young bear</i>.

1076
01:11:46,603 --> 01:11:49,868
<i>In the summer of 2000</i>
<i>came an extended drought</i>.

1077
01:11:49,973 --> 01:11:54,000
<i>The creek was so low that for weeks</i>
<i>there was no salmon run,</i>

1078
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:56,704
<i>and starving bears</i>
<i>simply ate their own</i>.

1079
01:11:58,915 --> 01:12:04,217
It has been only five, not even six days
since the baby died.

1080
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:08,052
And this is all that's left
of the little tyke.

1081
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:10,558
That's it!
There's nothing else left.

1082
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:13,128
They've eaten everything.

1083
01:12:16,199 --> 01:12:19,362
It's so sad.
She was so cute.

1084
01:12:20,704 --> 01:12:24,504
Five days and all
that's left is a skull.

1085
01:12:26,643 --> 01:12:29,476
<i>This called for desperate measures</i>.

1086
01:12:29,579 --> 01:12:34,107
There are fish lining up
about to try to make a run.

1087
01:12:34,217 --> 01:12:38,210
And now they have a good reason for going
because I have built them a corridor.

1088
01:12:38,321 --> 01:12:41,779
Let's have a look at it.
What I have done is... Have a look.

1089
01:12:41,891 --> 01:12:47,124
I've constructed a runway for them,
a navigational trail.

1090
01:12:47,230 --> 01:12:50,165
<i>When interference with nature</i>
<i>was not enough,</i>

1091
01:12:50,266 --> 01:12:53,258
<i>he had to invoke higher powers</i>.

1092
01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:57,238
Oh, live TV.
Live on tape.

1093
01:12:57,340 --> 01:13:01,367
Okay, so here's the deal.
Pull this down a little bit.

1094
01:13:03,646 --> 01:13:05,546
It's September 20.

1095
01:13:05,648 --> 01:13:08,549
It's the year 2000.
It's Expedition 2000.

1096
01:13:08,651 --> 01:13:11,381
There has not been a substantial rainfall
for almost two months.

1097
01:13:11,488 --> 01:13:15,185
The fish have not run since
about August 2, August 3.

1098
01:13:15,291 --> 01:13:19,057
We are now getting our first rain,
but it has just slowed down.

1099
01:13:19,162 --> 01:13:22,757
We need at least 2 inches,
I think even 3 inches of rain.

1100
01:13:22,866 --> 01:13:26,358
In the last two hours, we're up
a little over.20 inches of rain.

1101
01:13:26,469 --> 01:13:31,304
That is not enough. We're gonna
need more rain. We need more rain!

1102
01:13:31,408 --> 01:13:34,639
Downey is hungry!
Tabitha's hungry!

1103
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:37,212
Melissa is eating her babies.

1104
01:13:38,615 --> 01:13:42,642
I'm like a fucking nut.
We've got to have some rain.

1105
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:45,312
I'm not a religious guy. No.

1106
01:13:45,422 --> 01:13:49,654
But I'm telling ya,
I'm just pissed because...

1107
01:13:51,161 --> 01:13:53,425
It just doesn't seem right.
It just doesn't seem right.

1108
01:13:53,530 --> 01:13:56,397
I know it's just weather
and crap like that, and it's...

1109
01:13:56,499 --> 01:13:58,729
I don't know what
the variables are.

1110
01:13:58,835 --> 01:14:01,167
But we've gotta have
some goddamn rain!

1111
01:14:01,271 --> 01:14:04,832
So if there's a God,
Downey needs to eat!

1112
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:06,841
Dump on us. Hurt us!

1113
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:08,376
Come on!

1114
01:14:13,483 --> 01:14:15,383
Think rain.

1115
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:19,918
Think rain.

1116
01:14:20,023 --> 01:14:23,789
Just a crappy little shower right now.
What kind of crappy... Come on!

1117
01:14:23,893 --> 01:14:25,485
Take this again.

1118
01:14:25,595 --> 01:14:28,689
Does not make me
very, very happy.

1119
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:33,963
I want rain. I want, if there's a God,
to kick some ass down here.

1120
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:35,970
Let's have some water!

1121
01:14:36,072 --> 01:14:38,802
Jesus, boy!
Let's have some water!

1122
01:14:38,908 --> 01:14:41,308
Christ man or Allah

1123
01:14:41,411 --> 01:14:45,211
or Hindu floaty thing,

1124
01:14:45,315 --> 01:14:49,251
let's have some fucking water
for these animals!

1125
01:14:57,393 --> 01:15:03,161
It is now September 21, Thursday
of the year 2000. Expedition 2000.

1126
01:15:03,266 --> 01:15:05,234
I am the Lord's humble servant.

1127
01:15:05,335 --> 01:15:08,566
I am Allah's disciple.

1128
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:13,131
I am the floaty thing's go-for boy.

1129
01:15:13,243 --> 01:15:16,804
There has been a miracle here.
There has been an absolute miracle.

1130
01:15:16,913 --> 01:15:20,872
It has rained 1.65 inches
of rain today.

1131
01:15:20,984 --> 01:15:24,920
We have over 2 inches now in the storm,
and it is not stopping.

1132
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:27,012
It may hit 3 inches of rain.

1133
01:15:27,123 --> 01:15:30,854
It went from a trickle to a flood.
And it's ama<i>z</i>ing.

1134
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,121
And we have a really,
really great chance

1135
01:15:33,229 --> 01:15:36,562
of a run of fish for the animals.

1136
01:15:36,666 --> 01:15:39,635
And what is even more miraculous,

1137
01:15:39,736 --> 01:15:43,297
according to my radio,
it is not raining much

1138
01:15:43,406 --> 01:15:45,567
around anywhere else
but around here.

1139
01:15:49,512 --> 01:15:51,537
Oops.

1140
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:58,810
Well, it's now after 2:00
on October 4.

1141
01:15:58,922 --> 01:16:01,516
And the tent has caved in
due to the storm.

1142
01:16:01,624 --> 01:16:04,286
I'm still here with my little teddy bear,
Tabitha bear.

1143
01:16:04,394 --> 01:16:07,454
And I think the storm's actually
gotten a little weaker, but

1144
01:16:07,564 --> 01:16:11,762
in the course of it getting stronger,
it crushed the wall in and bent the poles.

1145
01:16:11,868 --> 01:16:14,803
And you really can't do much about it
because once they get like that,

1146
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:19,364
they just stay kind of bent in
and you're screwed and all that.

1147
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:23,970
This is my life.
This is what I do.

1148
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,571
And l... I love it. I love it.

1149
01:16:26,683 --> 01:16:28,446
Even this, I love it.

1150
01:16:29,652 --> 01:16:33,645
My tent crushed in. I love it.
It's pathetic, but I love it.

1151
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:36,452
<i>Hello, hello, hello</i>

1152
01:16:40,196 --> 01:16:41,959
Are you scared, little bear?

1153
01:16:42,065 --> 01:16:44,295
The storm's gonna go on
and on and on.

1154
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:47,665
It doesn't look like I may get outta here
for another week or so.

1155
01:16:50,006 --> 01:16:54,807
Oh, look at this. I put my tripod
up to shore up the tent.

1156
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:58,074
I put a pole up there, so now I got a tent.
That's a pretty good idea, huh?

1157
01:16:58,181 --> 01:17:00,706
Aha! Pretty good for me.

1158
01:17:12,462 --> 01:17:17,365
We have about 35,000 brown
gri<i>zz</i>ly bears here in Alaska.

1159
01:17:17,467 --> 01:17:21,631
What we can tell, it's a very healthy population,
it's a stable population.

1160
01:17:21,738 --> 01:17:24,730
Of course, you have to be careful with bears
because they have unique needs,

1161
01:17:24,841 --> 01:17:26,775
especially the gri<i>zz</i>ly bear.

1162
01:17:26,876 --> 01:17:30,312
They need large areas.
They have low reproductive rates.

1163
01:17:30,413 --> 01:17:33,075
You have to be cautious in the way
you utili<i>z</i>e those animals.

1164
01:17:33,182 --> 01:17:35,082
Bear hunting, as an example,

1165
01:17:35,184 --> 01:17:37,550
is a very important aspect
of the economy.

1166
01:17:37,654 --> 01:17:40,817
$4,500,000 a year
is spent on bear hunts.

1167
01:17:40,923 --> 01:17:44,882
Here on Kodiak Island
we have about 3,000 bears.

1168
01:17:44,994 --> 01:17:48,054
Each year we harvest
about 160 of those.

1169
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:52,760
Through our research, we found that you can
harvest about 6% of the population annually

1170
01:17:52,869 --> 01:17:55,497
and still have
a healthy group of bears.

1171
01:17:56,539 --> 01:17:58,336
And poaching?

1172
01:17:58,441 --> 01:18:00,875
Poaching is not as big
a concern around here

1173
01:18:00,977 --> 01:18:05,209
as it has been in Russia, for instance,
and some other locations.

1174
01:18:05,314 --> 01:18:07,544
There is some poaching
that occurs for gall bladders

1175
01:18:07,650 --> 01:18:09,709
or some bears that
are just killed wantonly

1176
01:18:09,819 --> 01:18:12,879
because people don't like them
or they're afraid of them.

1177
01:18:12,989 --> 01:18:16,390
But for the most part, here on Kodiak
and on the Alaska peninsula,

1178
01:18:16,492 --> 01:18:19,484
it is a very rare occurrence
in the last 20 years.

1179
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:22,598
<i>Despite the statistics,</i>

1180
01:18:22,699 --> 01:18:25,099
<i>Treadwell became</i>
<i>increasingly paranoid</i>

1181
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:27,931
<i>about his enemy, the poacher</i>.

1182
01:18:28,037 --> 01:18:31,200
And it's gotten to be September,
near October.

1183
01:18:31,307 --> 01:18:33,502
It's the time of year
where poachers can come around.

1184
01:18:33,609 --> 01:18:36,669
It's time for me to go in my guerrilla-style
camouflage outfit.

1185
01:18:36,779 --> 01:18:40,112
Downey still recogni<i>z</i>es me
by talking to her. Don't you?

1186
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:43,447
Yeah, I'm the big cra<i>z</i>y guy with the...
or the skinny cra<i>z</i>y guy

1187
01:18:43,553 --> 01:18:46,784
with the camouflage makeup on.

1188
01:18:51,828 --> 01:18:55,696
They're armed with pepper spray
and rocks.

1189
01:18:55,798 --> 01:18:58,892
<i>In all his video recordings</i>
<i>over the years,</i>

1190
01:18:59,001 --> 01:19:03,199
<i>this is Treadwell's closest</i>
<i>encounter with intruders</i>.

1191
01:19:03,306 --> 01:19:06,275
I believe the guide is the person
with the camera.

1192
01:19:06,375 --> 01:19:10,209
The big camera on the tripod.
There we go. Got a nice close-up of him.

1193
01:19:10,313 --> 01:19:13,976
He's the one who threw the rock
at Freckles, the bear.

1194
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:17,746
It's Quincy.

1195
01:19:17,854 --> 01:19:19,845
They're throwing rocks at him.

1196
01:19:19,956 --> 01:19:22,891
They're throwing rocks
at my Quincy.

1197
01:19:22,992 --> 01:19:25,460
They're gonna stone him,
and then they're gonna photograph him.

1198
01:19:33,803 --> 01:19:35,532
Oh, that's it!

1199
01:19:35,638 --> 01:19:37,663
That's enough of this.

1200
01:19:37,774 --> 01:19:40,607
That's... I can... They hit Quincy.

1201
01:19:44,547 --> 01:19:47,311
I don't wanna expose myself
to them.

1202
01:19:47,416 --> 01:19:51,682
I'm submitting this
as Sunday, August 1.

1203
01:19:51,788 --> 01:19:57,055
It is 4:35 and 18 seconds
on this day.

1204
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:01,456
It's hard to say,
but it's a warning of a sort.

1205
01:20:01,564 --> 01:20:04,556
And it's obviously here
to upset me.

1206
01:20:06,435 --> 01:20:10,769
"Hi, Timothy.
See you in summer of 2001."

1207
01:20:10,873 --> 01:20:13,273
Now it doesn't say, "Hi, Timothy.
We're gonna fucking kill you."

1208
01:20:13,376 --> 01:20:16,903
It doesn't say, "Hi, Timothy. You're fucking
dead. We're gonna chop your legs off.

1209
01:20:17,013 --> 01:20:19,140
Hey, Timothy,
get the fuck out."

1210
01:20:19,248 --> 01:20:22,445
It just says, "See you
in the summer of 2001."

1211
01:20:22,552 --> 01:20:24,486
But it is some sort
of a warning.

1212
01:20:24,587 --> 01:20:26,919
It is some sort of a ha-ha.

1213
01:20:27,023 --> 01:20:28,991
I don't think it's friendly.

1214
01:20:29,091 --> 01:20:33,152
Well, it's gotten
a little worse here.

1215
01:20:33,262 --> 01:20:36,356
The warning, "Hi, Timothy.
See you summer of 2001."

1216
01:20:36,465 --> 01:20:40,765
Now I find this big stack of rocks that were,
you know, put some labor here.

1217
01:20:40,870 --> 01:20:45,807
We're not calling this
the building of the pyramids.

1218
01:20:45,908 --> 01:20:48,570
But we are saying
there's a bit of trouble.

1219
01:20:48,678 --> 01:20:51,841
Now, I'm gonna walk back,
I'm gonna bring you back here.

1220
01:20:53,983 --> 01:20:58,147
Through my camp.
Let's come through here. Pathway.

1221
01:20:58,254 --> 01:21:00,188
Here's where...

1222
01:21:00,289 --> 01:21:04,089
Here's where the sign was, here.
Which is where my tent is.

1223
01:21:04,193 --> 01:21:07,651
And then we go over where
my bear-proof barrels would be.

1224
01:21:07,763 --> 01:21:11,961
And we find boulders piled up...

1225
01:21:12,068 --> 01:21:14,093
Boulders piled up

1226
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:19,072
and a happy face indelibly
painted into the rock,

1227
01:21:19,175 --> 01:21:21,200
like looking at me.

1228
01:21:24,013 --> 01:21:26,914
Very, very frickin' frightening, huh?

1229
01:21:27,016 --> 01:21:28,984
Whoever put it there,

1230
01:21:31,888 --> 01:21:35,016
knew what they were doing.

1231
01:21:35,124 --> 01:21:36,785
It's a warning.

1232
01:21:36,893 --> 01:21:41,592
And the thing is, it's better
than a warning, than...

1233
01:21:41,697 --> 01:21:44,325
It's better than like,
"You're fucking dead" type of thing.

1234
01:21:44,433 --> 01:21:46,993
It's creepy, baby!
It's creepy.

1235
01:21:47,103 --> 01:21:49,071
It's Freddy Krueger creepy.

1236
01:21:51,574 --> 01:21:53,735
<i>There were visitors</i>
<i>every now and then</i>.

1237
01:21:53,843 --> 01:21:56,869
<i>But for Treadwell,</i>
<i>they were just intruders</i>.

1238
01:21:56,979 --> 01:22:01,507
<i>An encroaching threat upon what</i>
<i>he considered his Eden</i>.

1239
01:22:03,986 --> 01:22:07,012
<i>Even the Park Service itself</i>
<i>became an enemy</i>

1240
01:22:07,123 --> 01:22:09,557
<i>because of its restrictions</i>.

1241
01:22:10,927 --> 01:22:14,124
I have decided to violate
a federal rule

1242
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:17,256
which states
I must camp one mile...

1243
01:22:17,366 --> 01:22:21,427
Every week I must move one mile after
staying for seven consecutive days.

1244
01:22:21,537 --> 01:22:23,437
If I was to do that,

1245
01:22:23,539 --> 01:22:26,406
I would not be able to study these bears,
not be able to protect them.

1246
01:22:26,509 --> 01:22:30,036
I'd have to move out of the bay
to get a mile out.

1247
01:22:30,146 --> 01:22:34,549
Therefore I have decided to protest
the United States government

1248
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:37,380
and guard these bears anyway
and stay, and I have...

1249
01:22:37,486 --> 01:22:42,287
<i>In order to get around the rule of not</i>
<i>camping permanently in one spot,</i>

1250
01:22:42,391 --> 01:22:46,919
<i>he would camouflage and hide</i>
<i>his tent from the Park Service</i>.

1251
01:22:47,029 --> 01:22:50,328
<i>But more than that,</i>
<i>he was in constant violation</i>

1252
01:22:50,433 --> 01:22:53,231
<i>of another very reasonable</i>
<i>park rule:</i>

1253
01:22:53,336 --> 01:22:58,672
<i>That you have to maintain at least 100 yards</i>
<i>distance from the bears</i>.

1254
01:22:58,774 --> 01:23:00,605
Ding.

1255
01:23:01,978 --> 01:23:05,038
Hi. Go back to your friend.
Go back to your friend.

1256
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:08,613
Shh, shh, shh.
It's okay.

1257
01:23:08,718 --> 01:23:10,845
It's okay.

1258
01:23:10,953 --> 01:23:14,081
You're awfully close.
You're awfully close.

1259
01:23:14,190 --> 01:23:16,590
Hi. Oh, hi, there!

1260
01:23:16,692 --> 01:23:20,492
<i>The park restrictions made him</i>
<i>increasingly irate</i>.

1261
01:23:24,934 --> 01:23:28,665
Well, we're into autumn now.
Expedition 2001 coming to an end.

1262
01:23:28,771 --> 01:23:31,205
The bears moving safely
towards their winter dens.

1263
01:23:31,307 --> 01:23:33,241
The foxes hiding in the woods,

1264
01:23:33,342 --> 01:23:36,175
safe from the humans
that would come to harm them.

1265
01:23:36,278 --> 01:23:38,974
It's been an ama<i>z</i>ing season.
It's been difficult.

1266
01:23:39,081 --> 01:23:43,074
But I came, I served,
I protected and I studied.

1267
01:23:43,185 --> 01:23:45,619
And I promise, I'll be back.

1268
01:23:55,398 --> 01:23:57,992
My hair.

1269
01:23:58,100 --> 01:24:02,594
Expedition 2001 coming to an end for
Gri<i>zz</i>ly People, for me, Timothy Treadwell.

1270
01:24:02,705 --> 01:24:05,196
I came here and protected
the animals as best I could.

1271
01:24:05,307 --> 01:24:08,504
In fact, I'm the only protection
for these animals out here.

1272
01:24:08,611 --> 01:24:12,012
The government flying over a total
of two times in two months.

1273
01:24:12,114 --> 01:24:15,106
How dare they!
How dare they challenge me!

1274
01:24:15,217 --> 01:24:17,777
How dare they smear me
with their campaigns!

1275
01:24:17,887 --> 01:24:20,583
How dare they, when they do not
look after these animals,

1276
01:24:20,689 --> 01:24:23,180
and I come here in peace
and in love,

1277
01:24:23,292 --> 01:24:25,624
neutral in respect.

1278
01:24:27,329 --> 01:24:29,263
I will continue to do this.
I will fight them.

1279
01:24:29,365 --> 01:24:31,799
I will be an American dissident
if I need be.

1280
01:24:31,901 --> 01:24:33,869
There's a patriotic time
going on right now,

1281
01:24:33,969 --> 01:24:35,994
but as far as this
fucking government's concerned,

1282
01:24:36,105 --> 01:24:38,471
fuck you,
motherfucking Park Service!

1283
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:41,372
<i>Now Treadwell crosses a line</i>
<i>with the Park Service</i>

1284
01:24:41,477 --> 01:24:43,775
<i>which we will not cross</i>.

1285
01:24:43,879 --> 01:24:49,112
<i>He attacks the individuals with</i>
<i>whom he worked for 13 years</i>.

1286
01:24:49,218 --> 01:24:51,914
I beat your fucking asses!
I protected the animals!

1287
01:24:52,021 --> 01:24:54,649
I did it! Fuck you!

1288
01:24:55,825 --> 01:24:58,919
Animals rule.
Timothy conquered.

1289
01:24:59,028 --> 01:25:01,622
Fuck you, Park Service!

1290
01:25:03,332 --> 01:25:04,856
Okay.

1291
01:25:04,967 --> 01:25:07,834
<i>It is clear to me that the Park Service</i>

1292
01:25:07,937 --> 01:25:11,373
<i>is not Treadwell's real enemy</i>.

1293
01:25:11,474 --> 01:25:15,205
<i>There's a larger, more</i>
<i>implacable adversary out there:</i>

1294
01:25:15,311 --> 01:25:18,178
<i>The people's world</i>
<i>and civilization</i>.

1295
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:21,181
"Oh, Timothy, I'm getting
a bad feeling about you."

1296
01:25:21,283 --> 01:25:24,616
<i>He only has mockery</i>
<i>and contempt for it</i>.

1297
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:28,622
"I saw you on <i>David Letterman</i>.
You're fairly entertaining."

1298
01:25:28,724 --> 01:25:33,218
<i>His rage is almost</i>
<i>incandescent, artistic</i>.

1299
01:25:33,329 --> 01:25:37,527
<i>The actor in his film has</i>
<i>taken over from the filmmaker</i>.

1300
01:25:37,633 --> 01:25:41,364
<i>I have seen this madness</i>
<i>before on a film set</i>.

1301
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:46,533
<i>But Treadwell is not an actor in opposition</i>
<i>to a director or a producer</i>.

1302
01:25:46,642 --> 01:25:50,601
<i>He's fighting civilization itself</i>.

1303
01:25:50,713 --> 01:25:54,945
<i>It is the same civilization</i>
<i>that cast Thoreau out of Walden</i>

1304
01:25:55,050 --> 01:25:57,814
<i>and John Muir into the wild</i>.

1305
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:59,581
Animals rule.

1306
01:26:01,390 --> 01:26:04,518
All right.
That's my happy stuff.

1307
01:26:04,627 --> 01:26:06,822
Let's do a couple
of nice takes now.

1308
01:26:06,929 --> 01:26:09,295
Oh, man, did I get angry!
Fuck them, right?

1309
01:26:09,398 --> 01:26:11,662
They do not watch these animals.
They don't care about these animals.

1310
01:26:11,767 --> 01:26:15,066
All they wanna do
is screw people like me around.

1311
01:26:15,171 --> 01:26:17,503
It's ama<i>z</i>ing. "Let the fishermen
fucking shoot the animals.

1312
01:26:17,606 --> 01:26:19,437
Let the fucking poachers
come in here and fuck 'em.

1313
01:26:19,542 --> 01:26:21,442
Let the fucking commercial
people fuck them around

1314
01:26:21,544 --> 01:26:24,138
with their fucking cameras
and the tourists.

1315
01:26:24,246 --> 01:26:26,077
But we're gonna go screw
with Timothy Treadwell

1316
01:26:26,182 --> 01:26:28,912
because he loves animals
and teaches kids for free.

1317
01:26:29,018 --> 01:26:30,713
Let's go. Let's do that.
That's what we're gonna do."

1318
01:26:30,819 --> 01:26:34,186
Well, fuck them. Fuck them.
I beat you, motherfuckers. I beat you.

1319
01:26:34,290 --> 01:26:36,190
Beat ya, so fuck you.

1320
01:26:36,292 --> 01:26:38,852
I beat ya. I beat ya.

1321
01:26:38,961 --> 01:26:40,519
I'm the champion.
I'm the fucking champion.

1322
01:26:40,629 --> 01:26:43,757
I beat you.
I beat your fucking asses.

1323
01:26:43,866 --> 01:26:47,597
Fucking losers!
Fucking nobodies!

1324
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:49,568
Fuck!

1325
01:26:49,672 --> 01:26:52,664
Fucking fucks!

1326
01:26:54,777 --> 01:26:56,745
Well, Expedition 2001
coming to an end.

1327
01:26:56,845 --> 01:27:00,611
The bears safely moving into their winter dens,
the foxes hiding in the woods.

1328
01:27:00,716 --> 01:27:04,482
I came here. I studied them,
protected them.

1329
01:27:04,587 --> 01:27:10,355
And I promise you, I promise the
Gri<i>zz</i>ly People, I will be back. I will be back.

1330
01:27:10,459 --> 01:27:14,589
And I thank the animals for keeping
me safe and for inspiring me.

1331
01:27:14,697 --> 01:27:16,995
I thank them so very much.

1332
01:27:18,167 --> 01:27:20,101
Good-bye.

1333
01:27:22,137 --> 01:27:24,401
This is my favorite.

1334
01:27:24,506 --> 01:27:26,440
This is my cowboy.

1335
01:27:26,542 --> 01:27:29,170
Always in black.
Always sunglasses.

1336
01:27:29,278 --> 01:27:31,303
And always a bandanna.

1337
01:27:32,948 --> 01:27:35,542
I miss you terribly.

1338
01:27:37,319 --> 01:27:39,480
He was very dear to my heart.

1339
01:27:39,588 --> 01:27:41,783
Very dear to my heart.

1340
01:27:44,693 --> 01:27:47,719
My heart hurts every day
for him.

1341
01:27:47,830 --> 01:27:49,661
He was a good friend.

1342
01:27:52,935 --> 01:27:55,028
I've known him 13 years.

1343
01:27:55,137 --> 01:27:57,105
And he just was a good friend.

1344
01:27:57,206 --> 01:27:59,970
He was a distant friend
in the winter

1345
01:28:00,075 --> 01:28:02,202
and a close friend
in the summer.

1346
01:28:02,311 --> 01:28:06,372
And... I helped him do
quite a few things here.

1347
01:28:07,416 --> 01:28:09,247
He'd always come back.

1348
01:28:09,351 --> 01:28:12,115
And I was kind of
his confidante here.

1349
01:28:14,356 --> 01:28:15,789
But I miss him.

1350
01:28:15,891 --> 01:28:20,055
I miss his... rambunctious personality

1351
01:28:20,162 --> 01:28:22,790
and his outgoing... his heart,

1352
01:28:22,898 --> 01:28:25,992
you know, just everything
about him, I think.

1353
01:28:27,303 --> 01:28:29,271
<i>Kathleen Parker still holds</i>

1354
01:28:29,371 --> 01:28:32,169
<i>some of</i>
<i>Timothy Treadwell's ashes</i>.

1355
01:28:32,274 --> 01:28:36,506
<i>She insists that she was</i>
<i>a platonic friend only</i>.

1356
01:28:36,612 --> 01:28:40,605
<i>She stored his gear in her basement</i>
<i>during the winters</i>.

1357
01:28:40,716 --> 01:28:44,584
<i>He would set out into</i>
<i>the wilderness from her house</i>.

1358
01:28:44,687 --> 01:28:48,919
When he would leave,
he would say at my back door,

1359
01:28:49,024 --> 01:28:50,992
he says, "I love you."

1360
01:28:51,093 --> 01:28:55,120
He says, "This is going to be
the best year of my life out there."

1361
01:28:55,230 --> 01:28:58,324
And he says,
"If I don't come back,

1362
01:28:58,434 --> 01:29:02,029
it's what I want,
this is the way I wanna go."

1363
01:29:05,207 --> 01:29:09,109
His last camp was just right
in the right-hand edge of this slope.

1364
01:29:09,211 --> 01:29:11,304
Patch of trees here.

1365
01:29:14,450 --> 01:29:18,546
Right down here in this...
very end of these trees here.

1366
01:29:37,806 --> 01:29:39,774
This is his ashes.

1367
01:29:39,875 --> 01:29:42,571
Some of them for me to spread.

1368
01:29:42,678 --> 01:29:46,739
And some bear hair, fur.

1369
01:29:46,849 --> 01:29:50,444
And some weeds.
And what else is in there?

1370
01:29:50,552 --> 01:29:53,885
There's a little bit of lupin,
there's a little bit of iris.

1371
01:29:53,989 --> 01:29:57,755
- There's, I think...
- Where did you get the bear fur?

1372
01:29:57,860 --> 01:30:00,556
- We picked it up off the ground.
- Cool. Cool.

1373
01:30:00,662 --> 01:30:02,527
Where are we?

1374
01:30:02,631 --> 01:30:05,998
We are at a campsite
where Timothy last camped.

1375
01:30:06,101 --> 01:30:11,368
Not where he was killed.
But over here in Hallo Bay.

1376
01:30:11,473 --> 01:30:14,533
And, Willie, you can...
'cause you brought him over here.

1377
01:30:14,643 --> 01:30:18,170
His last campsite was right here
in the trees here.

1378
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:21,010
<i>He camped there because</i>
<i>he was right between two fox dens</i>.

1379
01:30:21,116 --> 01:30:22,947
<i>I'd been in the camp there</i>.

1380
01:30:23,051 --> 01:30:28,387
<i>The fox would come right to the edge</i>
<i>of the tent, and go in their dens</i>.

1381
01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:32,824
<i>So I think that's probably the main reason</i>
<i>he camped right there</i>.

1382
01:30:34,596 --> 01:30:36,359
<i>Okay, Timothy</i>.

1383
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:39,858
I love you.

1384
01:30:42,538 --> 01:30:45,063
And rest peacefully.

1385
01:30:48,377 --> 01:30:50,777
Rest peacefully, my love.

1386
01:30:53,749 --> 01:30:56,843
Finally figured a way out
to live here forever.

1387
01:30:56,952 --> 01:30:58,579
He's here forever.

1388
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:07,552
<i>This is Timothy Treadwell's</i>
<i>and Amie Huguenard's route</i>

1389
01:31:07,663 --> 01:31:10,461
<i>to the site of their death</i>.

1390
01:31:10,566 --> 01:31:14,002
<i>There was a certain absurdity</i>
<i>in their end</i>.

1391
01:31:14,102 --> 01:31:18,163
<i>As usual, the expedition was over</i>
<i>by the end of September,</i>

1392
01:31:18,273 --> 01:31:23,074
<i>and both had returned to Kodiak</i>
<i>on their way back to California</i>.

1393
01:31:24,446 --> 01:31:27,472
<i>Treadwell writes in his diary</i>
<i>that at the airport</i>

1394
01:31:27,583 --> 01:31:31,075
<i>he had an altercation</i>
<i>with an obese airline agent</i>

1395
01:31:31,186 --> 01:31:34,178
<i>over the validity of his ticket</i>.

1396
01:31:34,289 --> 01:31:37,520
<i>"How much I hate</i>
<i>the people's world, " he writes</i>.

1397
01:31:37,626 --> 01:31:39,821
<i>And disgusted,</i>
<i>he decides right then</i>

1398
01:31:39,928 --> 01:31:43,261
<i>to return to this spot</i>
<i>and his bears</i>.

1399
01:31:45,133 --> 01:31:49,467
<i>Once back in the Grizzly Maze,</i>
<i>Amie had mixed feelings</i>.

1400
01:31:49,571 --> 01:31:51,562
<i>She was afraid of the bears</i>

1401
01:31:51,673 --> 01:31:54,506
<i>and had a deadline to return</i>
<i>for a new job</i>

1402
01:31:54,610 --> 01:31:58,444
<i>and spoke openly</i>
<i>about leaving him for good</i>.

1403
01:31:58,547 --> 01:32:02,608
<i>According to one of the last entries</i>
<i>in Treadwell's diary,</i>

1404
01:32:02,718 --> 01:32:07,246
<i>Amie called him hell-bent</i>
<i>on destruction</i>.

1405
01:32:07,356 --> 01:32:12,419
<i>And yet, inexplicably, she remained</i>
<i>with him here in the Maze</i>.

1406
01:32:19,067 --> 01:32:23,197
<i>Normally Treadwell would not</i>
<i>be here this late in the year</i>.

1407
01:32:23,305 --> 01:32:25,705
<i>And upon their return,</i>

1408
01:32:25,807 --> 01:32:30,141
<i>he discovered that many of his bear friends</i>
<i>had gone into hibernation</i>.

1409
01:32:30,245 --> 01:32:33,442
<i>And scary,</i>
<i>unknown and wilder bears</i>

1410
01:32:33,549 --> 01:32:35,949
<i>from the interior had moved in</i>.

1411
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:42,351
<i>This is the spot where</i>
<i>they set up their last camp</i>.

1412
01:32:51,633 --> 01:32:53,567
Let me tell you.

1413
01:32:53,669 --> 01:32:58,663
Honestly, camping in gri<i>zz</i>ly country
is dangerous.

1414
01:32:58,774 --> 01:33:01,572
People who camp in gri<i>zz</i>ly country
should camp out in the open

1415
01:33:01,677 --> 01:33:04,339
to let the bears know
where the tent is.

1416
01:33:04,446 --> 01:33:06,414
My camp is unseen.

1417
01:33:06,515 --> 01:33:09,882
It is the most dangerous camping,
the most dangerous living

1418
01:33:09,985 --> 01:33:12,749
in the history of the world
by any human being.

1419
01:33:12,854 --> 01:33:17,587
I have lived longer with wild brown
gri<i>zz</i>ly bears, without weapons,

1420
01:33:17,693 --> 01:33:20,093
and that's the key, without weapons,
in modern history

1421
01:33:20,195 --> 01:33:23,995
than any human on earth,
any human.

1422
01:33:24,099 --> 01:33:25,999
And I have remained safe.

1423
01:33:26,101 --> 01:33:30,470
But every second of every day that I move
through this jungle, or even at the tent,

1424
01:33:30,572 --> 01:33:35,737
I am right on the precipice
of great bodily harm or even death.

1425
01:33:38,180 --> 01:33:40,978
And I am so thankful
for every minute of every day

1426
01:33:41,083 --> 01:33:43,017
that I found the bears

1427
01:33:43,118 --> 01:33:45,313
and this place,
the Gri<i>zz</i>ly Ma<i>z</i>e.

1428
01:33:50,892 --> 01:33:52,723
But let me tell you, ladies and gentlemen.

1429
01:33:52,828 --> 01:33:56,457
There is no, no, no
other place in the world

1430
01:33:56,565 --> 01:34:00,797
that is more dangerous, more exciting
than the Gri<i>zz</i>ly Ma<i>z</i>e.

1431
01:34:00,902 --> 01:34:03,336
Come here and camp here.
Come here and try to do what I do.

1432
01:34:03,438 --> 01:34:06,032
You will die.
You will die here.

1433
01:34:06,141 --> 01:34:09,372
You will frickin' die here.
They will get you.

1434
01:34:09,478 --> 01:34:12,845
I found a way. I found a way
to survive with them.

1435
01:34:12,948 --> 01:34:15,348
Am I a great person?
I don't know. I don't know.

1436
01:34:15,450 --> 01:34:19,147
We're all great people. Everyone has
something in them that's wonderful.

1437
01:34:19,254 --> 01:34:24,453
I'm just different. And I love these bears
enough to do it right.

1438
01:34:24,559 --> 01:34:28,723
And I'm edgy enough
and I'm tough enough.

1439
01:34:28,830 --> 01:34:34,132
But mostly I love these bears enough
to survive and do it right.

1440
01:34:34,236 --> 01:34:36,170
And I'm never giving this up.
Never giving it up.

1441
01:34:36,271 --> 01:34:39,434
Never giving up the Ma<i>z</i>e.
Never.

1442
01:34:39,541 --> 01:34:42,101
This is it.
This is my life.

1443
01:34:42,210 --> 01:34:44,405
This is my land.

1444
01:34:50,986 --> 01:34:54,149
<i>Very late in the process</i>
<i>of editing this film,</i>

1445
01:34:54,256 --> 01:34:58,022
<i>we were given access</i>
<i>to Treadwell's last videotape</i>.

1446
01:34:59,227 --> 01:35:02,594
<i>Here he may have filmed</i>
<i>his murderer</i>.

1447
01:35:05,934 --> 01:35:08,129
<i>The killer bear we know</i>
<i>was a male</i>

1448
01:35:08,236 --> 01:35:12,332
<i>whom years earlier</i>
<i>the Park Service had anesthetized</i>.

1449
01:35:12,441 --> 01:35:15,035
<i>They extracted a tooth</i>
<i>which established him</i>

1450
01:35:15,143 --> 01:35:18,374
<i>as being 28</i>
<i>at the time of the attack</i>.

1451
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:20,880
<i>Quite old for a bear</i>.

1452
01:35:20,982 --> 01:35:25,419
<i>They also tagged him</i>
<i>via a tattoo on his inner lip</i>.

1453
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:29,547
<i>They had given him</i>
<i>a number only, 141</i>.

1454
01:35:29,658 --> 01:35:33,685
<i>Bear 141</i>.
<i>That's all we know of him</i>.

1455
01:35:38,166 --> 01:35:42,125
<i>And here</i>.
<i>Could this one be Bear 141?</i>

1456
01:35:46,975 --> 01:35:50,502
<i>What looks playful</i>
<i>could be desperation</i>.

1457
01:35:50,612 --> 01:35:54,013
<i>So late in the season,</i>
<i>the bear is diving deep</i>

1458
01:35:54,116 --> 01:35:57,142
<i>for one of the few</i>
<i>remaining salmon carcasses</i>

1459
01:35:57,252 --> 01:35:59,516
<i>at the bottom of the lake</i>.

1460
01:36:19,341 --> 01:36:23,835
<i>Treadwell keeps filming the bear</i>
<i>with a strange persistence</i>.

1461
01:36:27,516 --> 01:36:30,110
<i>And all of a sudden, this</i>.

1462
01:36:32,754 --> 01:36:36,190
<i>Is Amie trying</i>
<i>to get out of the shot?</i>

1463
01:36:38,026 --> 01:36:42,827
<i>Did Treadwell wait till his last tape</i>
<i>to put her in his film?</i>

1464
01:36:48,069 --> 01:36:50,867
<i>And what haunts me,</i>
<i>is that in all the faces</i>

1465
01:36:50,972 --> 01:36:54,066
<i>of all the bears</i>
<i>that Treadwell ever filmed,</i>

1466
01:36:54,176 --> 01:36:58,408
<i>I discover no kinship,</i>
<i>no understanding, no mercy</i>.

1467
01:36:58,513 --> 01:37:03,951
<i>I see only the overwhelming</i>
<i>indifference of nature</i>.

1468
01:37:04,052 --> 01:37:08,955
<i>To me, there is no such thing</i>
<i>as a secret world of the bears</i>.

1469
01:37:09,057 --> 01:37:14,586
<i>And this blank stare speaks</i>
<i>only of a half-bored interest in food</i>.

1470
01:37:14,696 --> 01:37:19,998
<i>But for Timothy Treadwell,</i>
<i>this bear was a friend, a savior</i>.

1471
01:37:22,304 --> 01:37:24,204
<i>Amie Huguenard was screaming</i>.

1472
01:37:24,306 --> 01:37:28,367
All of a sudden, the intensity
of Amie's screaming

1473
01:37:28,476 --> 01:37:32,276
reached a new height
and became very, very loud.

1474
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:36,612
And she really now was screaming
at the top of her lungs.

1475
01:37:36,718 --> 01:37:40,984
These horrifying screams
were punctuated by Timothy saying,

1476
01:37:41,089 --> 01:37:45,048
"Go away. Leave me.
Go away. Run! Get out of here."

1477
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:48,789
In other words, Timothy is trying
now to save Amie's life

1478
01:37:48,897 --> 01:37:53,596
because Timothy reali<i>z</i>es,
at this point in time during this attack,

1479
01:37:53,702 --> 01:37:55,829
Timothy knows he's gonna die.

1480
01:37:55,937 --> 01:37:57,871
He knows that.

1481
01:37:57,973 --> 01:38:00,669
My sense of listening
to this tape

1482
01:38:00,775 --> 01:38:03,676
is that the bear let go,
probably let go

1483
01:38:03,778 --> 01:38:07,270
of the top of his head where
I found massive lacerations.

1484
01:38:07,382 --> 01:38:11,250
That is tears of the scalp
away from his head.

1485
01:38:11,353 --> 01:38:14,186
Suddenly, though, the bear,
after letting go,

1486
01:38:14,289 --> 01:38:18,783
grabbed Timothy somewhere
in the high leg area.

1487
01:38:18,894 --> 01:38:24,093
And Timothy, appropriately in my opinion,
as a human being,

1488
01:38:24,199 --> 01:38:28,659
decided now is the time
to save one life anyway.

1489
01:38:28,770 --> 01:38:32,501
If his life was going away,
if his life was fading away,

1490
01:38:32,607 --> 01:38:35,974
<i>now was the time</i>
<i>for Amie to get out</i>.

1491
01:38:39,014 --> 01:38:41,949
The expedition coming close to a close,

1492
01:38:42,050 --> 01:38:44,348
but I'm still here.

1493
01:38:44,452 --> 01:38:46,283
It's been over four months
in the wilderness.

1494
01:38:46,388 --> 01:38:48,549
And a hurricane-force
storm now building.

1495
01:38:48,657 --> 01:38:52,718
Over 50-mile-an-hour winds,
soon over 70.

1496
01:38:52,827 --> 01:38:55,227
The bears safely
heading for their dens.

1497
01:38:55,330 --> 01:38:58,026
The work...
the work successful.

1498
01:38:58,133 --> 01:39:01,796
I'm over 20 pounds lighter.
My clothes are rags.

1499
01:39:01,903 --> 01:39:05,839
I've tried hard. I bleed for them,
I live for them, I die for them.

1500
01:39:06,942 --> 01:39:09,570
I love them. I love this.

1501
01:39:13,048 --> 01:39:14,845
It's tough work.

1502
01:39:16,952 --> 01:39:20,945
But it's the only work I know.
It's the only work I'll ever want.

1503
01:39:22,757 --> 01:39:25,920
Take care of these animals.
Take care of this land.

1504
01:39:26,027 --> 01:39:31,124
<i>He seems to hesitate in leaving</i>
<i>the last frame of his own film</i>.

1505
01:39:31,232 --> 01:39:34,065
It's the only thing I know.

1506
01:39:34,169 --> 01:39:36,694
It's the only thing
I wanna know.

1507
01:39:46,715 --> 01:39:48,808
<i>Treadwell is gone</i>.

1508
01:39:48,917 --> 01:39:51,943
<i>The argument how wrong</i>
<i>or how right he was</i>

1509
01:39:52,053 --> 01:39:55,853
<i>disappears into a distance</i>
<i>into a fog</i>.

1510
01:39:55,957 --> 01:39:59,290
<i>What remains is his footage</i>.

1511
01:39:59,394 --> 01:40:03,387
<i>And while we watch the animals</i>
<i>in their joys of being,</i>

1512
01:40:03,498 --> 01:40:05,966
<i>in their grace</i>
<i>and ferociousness,</i>

1513
01:40:06,067 --> 01:40:08,763
<i>a thought becomes</i>
<i>more and more clear</i>.

1514
01:40:08,870 --> 01:40:11,805
<i>That it is not so much</i>
<i>a look at wild nature</i>

1515
01:40:11,906 --> 01:40:16,138
<i>as it is an insight</i>
<i>into ourselves, our nature</i>.

1516
01:40:17,746 --> 01:40:20,806
<i>And that, for me,</i>
<i>beyond his mission,</i>

1517
01:40:20,915 --> 01:40:24,908
<i>gives meaning to his life</i>
<i>and to his death</i>.

1518
01:40:47,609 --> 01:40:50,134
<i>Now the longhorns are gone</i>

1519
01:40:50,245 --> 01:40:52,645
<i>And the drovers are gone</i>

1520
01:40:52,747 --> 01:40:55,147
<i>The Comanches are gone</i>

1521
01:40:55,250 --> 01:40:57,980
<i>And the outlaws are gone</i>

1522
01:40:58,086 --> 01:41:00,145
<i>Geronimo's gone</i>

1523
01:41:00,255 --> 01:41:02,780
<i>And Sam Bass is gone</i>

1524
01:41:02,891 --> 01:41:05,325
<i>And the lion is gone</i>

1525
01:41:05,427 --> 01:41:09,693
- <i>And the red wolf is gone</i>
- <i>And Treadwell is gone</i>

1526
01:41:11,332 --> 01:41:15,462
<i>Well, he cursed all the roads</i>
<i>and the old mule</i>

1527
01:41:16,571 --> 01:41:20,029
<i>And he cursed the automobile</i>

1528
01:41:21,543 --> 01:41:25,775
<i>Said this is no place</i>
<i>for an hombre like I am</i>

1529
01:41:27,215 --> 01:41:31,276
<i>In this new world</i>
<i>of asphalt and steel</i>

1530
01:41:32,921 --> 01:41:36,857
<i>Then he'd look off</i>
<i>someplace in the distance</i>

1531
01:41:38,059 --> 01:41:41,551
<i>At something</i>
<i>only he could see</i>

1532
01:41:43,131 --> 01:41:47,227
<i>He'd say all that's left now</i>
<i>are the old days</i>

1533
01:41:48,803 --> 01:41:53,103
<i>Damned old coyotes and me</i>

1534
01:41:53,208 --> 01:41:54,869
<i>And they'd go</i>

1535
01:42:14,295 --> 01:42:16,729
<i>Now the longhorns are gone</i>

1536
01:42:16,831 --> 01:42:19,231
<i>And the drovers are gone</i>

1537
01:42:19,334 --> 01:42:21,962
<i>The Comanches are gone</i>

1538
01:42:22,070 --> 01:42:24,334
<i>The outlaws are gone</i>

1539
01:42:24,439 --> 01:42:26,669
<i>Now Quantrill is gone</i>

1540
01:42:26,774 --> 01:42:29,368
<i>Stan Wanty is gone</i>

1541
01:42:29,477 --> 01:42:31,968
<i>And the lion is gone</i>

1542
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:35,277
<i>And the red wolf is gone</i>

1543
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:43,313
<i>One morning they searched</i>
<i>his adobe</i>

1544
01:42:44,559 --> 01:42:48,461
<i>He disappeared</i>
<i>without even a word</i>

1545
01:42:50,131 --> 01:42:54,261
<i>But that night as the moon</i>
<i>crossed the mountain</i>

1546
01:42:55,904 --> 01:42:59,863
<i>One more coyote was heard</i>

1547
01:43:02,577 --> 01:43:04,442
<i>And he'd go</i>
