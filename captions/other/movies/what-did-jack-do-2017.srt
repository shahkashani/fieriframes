[trains clattering faintly]

3
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:36,286
So, we meet
in a train station.

4
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:45,086
Jack.

00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,380
[train brakes screeching softly]

6
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:54,137
You know anything about birds, Jack?

7
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:01,770
Why do you ask?

8
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,190
It's just a simple question.

9
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:09,611
Don't worry.

10
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,405
I've heard the phrase,

11
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:16,076
"Birds of a feather flock together."

12
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,080
Yes.

13
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,917
A perceived fundamental.

14
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:29,172
There are, of course, exceptions.

15
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,176
You've been seen with birds.

16
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,261
Farm birds.

17
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:45,188
For a while, I lived near a farm.

18
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,607
Look at me!

19
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,026
Are my pupils dilated?

20
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,612
You're avoiding the question.

21
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,032
Listen to me.

22
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,828
If my train was on time,
I wouldn't even be here now.

23
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,080
Now, you listen.

24
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,207
You've been seen with chickens,

25
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,751
associating with chickens.

26
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:08,795
But you said...

27
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,839
I know what I said.

28
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:17,470
You are a strong-arm man?

29
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,181
You could say that.

30
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,144
I just did.

31
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:29,023
Well, there is no Santa Claus.

32
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,653
I won't be here for Christmas.

33
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,866
But the ladies have been talking, Jack.

34
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,035
What?

35
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:45,081
Right. With the Easter Bunny, I suppose.

36
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,750
Is that what you want me to believe?

37
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,880
You'll not get a free lunch around here.

38
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,926
I read the papers.

39

[trains clattering in distance]

40
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,557
Tell me about Toototabon.

41
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,060
You can burn in hell.

42
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,023
Don't you ever wonder about anything?

43
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,112
The wonder was in my heart,

44
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,699
but you wouldn't understand
something like that.

45
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,994
There's an elephant in the room.

46
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,705
I'd like you to start talking turkey.

47
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:34,422
I ordered coffee about a half hour ago.

48
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,389
Do you play for keeps?

49
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,101
Is there any other way?

50

[door opening]

51
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,820
All right, two coffees.

Aw, thanks, hotshot.

55
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,118
Sorry it took so long.

56
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,329
All the outgoing trains are stopped.

57
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,165
The place is crawling
with hungry passengers and cops.

58
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,753
It seems there's a murderer on the loose.

[door opens and closes]

Are you now or have you ever been

62
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:31,479
a card-carrying member
of the Communist Party?

63
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,485
Let me tell you a story.

64
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:42,532
My father was a pipefitter
for the DeWitt family.

65
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,076
I'm not shitting you.

66
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:49,706
I would've laid my life on the line
for any chicken

67
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,874
or rooster.

68
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,169
You ever ride the rodeo?

69
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:00,174
Who told you that? Sally?

70
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,137
I'm a plastic bag specialist.

71
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,598
Is that so?

72
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,936
A jack of many trades.

73
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,692
You ever do farm work?

74
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,154
There you go again.

75
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:26,117
You'd toss an animal up on a roof
just to see the look on its face.

76
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,370
My place was raided,

77
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,164
set to fire.

78
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,292
I'm lucky to have my life,

79
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,544
let alone the hair on my body.

80
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,465
Are you going to drink your coffee?

81
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:51,434
Maybe I will, maybe I won't.

82
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,025
They found feathers.

83
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,237
Bullshit.

84
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,907
Are you calling me a liar?

85
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,786
I <i>know</i> why the chicken crossed the road.

86
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:15,833
This conversation just came
to a screeching halt.

87
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,839
Be a man, Jack, and tell me about her.

88
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,302
Go climb a tree.

89

Getting nervous?

90
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,140
What?

91
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,476
You think you just rolled a seven?

92
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,437
Maybe.

93
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,690
Well, think again.

94
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:42,985
I used to hang out with clowns like you.

95
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,948
Where, in Bristol?

96
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,576
Never mention that place to me again.

97
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,831
Don't you have any sense of decency?

98
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,127
You were wrong, you know.

99
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,588
No one was with her that night.

100
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,092
She was all alone, waiting for you.

101
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:12,598
You were so sure she was with someone
that you never showed.

102
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,980
Don't you know that she cried
all night long over you?

103
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,693
Right or wrong, she loved you.

104
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,573
You're brewing a poisonous batch.

105
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,244
This thing is bigger than both of us.

106
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:39,625
I'm telling you how it was for real.

107
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,044
Think back.

108
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,298
You have no proof Max left the club.

109
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,676
Don't need proof.

110
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,011
[strikes match]

111
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,734
I have the police report.

112
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:12,909
No matter. I saw it all in her eyes.

113
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,454
So you admit it.

114
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,331
You saw her that night.

115
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:25,463
I saw her from the window when
she leaned out to see him get his tab.

116
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,632
I saw Max.

117
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,593
And that's when you shot him.

118
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,430
Prove it.

119
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,476
We have Sally.

120
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,898
Who's gonna believe an orangutan?

121
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,192
Maybe a jury, big boy.

122
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:53,074
I'll see you and raise you five.

123
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,078
I don't bluff.

124
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,874
Yeah, and you don't smoke.

125
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,174
Takes two to tango, Jack.

126
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,888
Oh, so now we're dancing.

127
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,140
The party is over, cowboy,

128
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,351
and everyone's gone home.

129
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,187
The musicians are packing up,

130
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:28,317
and the janitor is standing by
with his whore named Sally.

131
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,279
Did anyone ever question him?

132
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,657
His name is Shelby Tidsworth.

133
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:39,745
Shelby was banging Sally
like there was no tomorrow

134
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,998
and yesterday was gone.

135
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:46,377
And he had his eye on Toototabon.

136
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,255
I don't own a gun.

137
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:54,093
I have a Buck knife which I only use
going into the wild.

138
00:09:54,552 --> 00:10:00,141
I once sliced a gator
that was going after a rabbit friend.

139
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:03,060
There was blood everywhere.

140
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,770
Before that mess,

141
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:08,733
I'd only seen a red rabbit in a dream.

142
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,321
The janitor, huh?

143
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,743
Am I all alone here?

144
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:19,952
Yeah.

145
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,579
Shelby.

146
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:26,667
Suffers from advanced stages of gonorrhea.

147
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:31,005
His left arm weighs 75 pounds.

148
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,717
He could have shot Max that night.

149
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:39,388
Okay, let's go back to the beginning.

150
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:46,812
Life in those times was hard.

151
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,358
Hard enough to crack a coconut.

152
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,568
For argument's sake,

153
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,905
let's say I was a horse.

154
00:10:56,405 --> 00:11:00,618
Even so, it'd be hard to imagine

155
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:05,665
how hard my first wife rode my ass.

156
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,501
I'm a small man,

157
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:12,838
and not necessarily of what you could call
good health.

158
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:17,635
But I took it from her for six long years.

159
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:22,139
Finally some banshee killed her
out in the bush.

160
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,185
I thought I'd died and gone to heaven.

161
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:31,148
The freedom I felt was extraordinary.

162
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,987
That's when I met Toototabon...

163
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,825
and fell head over heels.

164
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,785
Looking back,

165
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:46,247
she really was my first love.

166
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,583
Real love, it was.

167
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:53,629
They say real love is a banana,

168
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,425
sweet with a golden hue.

169
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,176
Yes...

170
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,471
