1
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,351
Thank God, we arrived.

2
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,562
Speak Italian.

3
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,565
Sorry. We've arrived.

4
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,818
I stopped far away
so we could go for a walk.

5
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,906
It's a marvelous painting.

6
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,828
I cried the first time I saw it.

7
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:13,378
This light reminds me of the autumn
in Moscow in Neskuchny Garden.

8
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:20,135
- Come on.
- I don't want to.

9
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:23,221
I'll go ahead and wait for you inside.

10
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,807
I don't want to.
I already told you.

11
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:35,025
I am fed up with all your beauties.

12
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:42,032
I don't want to take it alone anymore.
All this beauty of yours...

13
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,291
I can't take it anymore.
That's it.

14
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,131
Do you want a baby too?

15
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,634
Or are you asking God to spare you?

16
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,137
I'm here just to have a look.

17
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,603
Unfortunately,
if there are any casual onlookers

18
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,564
who aren't supplicants,

19
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,067
then nothing happens.

20
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,113
What is supposed to happen?

21
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:50,118
Whatever you like,
whatever you need most.

22
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:57,083
But you should
at least kneel down.

23
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,612
- I can't.
- Look at them.

24
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,614
They're used to it.

25
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,450
- They have faith.
- Probably.

26
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,799
Can I ask you something?

27
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,181
Why do you think...

28
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:22,645
it's only the women
who pray so much?

29
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:29,694
- You're asking me?
- You see so many women here.

30
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:33,490
I'm only the sacristan.
I don't know these things.

31
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:39,496
But you must wonder
why women are more devout than men.

32
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:43,041
You should know better than I.

33
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,210
Because I'm a woman?

34
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,963
No, I've never understood
these things.

35
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,886
I'm a simple man.

36
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,015
But I think...

37
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:04,145
a woman is meant
to have children...

38
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,273
to raise them...

39
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,568
with patience...

40
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,155
and self-sacrifice.

41
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:17,117
That's all she's meant for?

42
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:22,205
- I don't know.
- Thank you.

43
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,582
You've been a great help.

44
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,546
You asked what I thought.

45
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,595
I know... you want to be happy.

46
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,015
There are more important things.

47
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,020
Wait.

48
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,925
Mother of all mothers,
who knows the pain of being a mother.

49
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,721
Mother of all mothers,
who knows the joy of being a mother.

50
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:23,600
Mother of all children,
who knows the joy of having a child.

51
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:27,437
Mother of all children,
who knows the pain of not having a child.

52
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,066
Mother who understands all,
help your daughter to become a mother.

53
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,900
I just don't understand you.

54
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:23,404
You go on and on
about the Madonna of Childbirth.

55
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:30,453
We drove halfway
across Italy in the fog.

56
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,377
And you didn't even
go in there to see her.

57
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,947
What are you reading?

58
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:11,577
Arseny Tarkovsky's poems.

59
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:15,373
- In Russian?
- No, it's a translation.

60
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,042
Quite a good one.

61
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:22,004
- Throw it away.
- Why?

62
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:26,592
The translator's
a very good poet.

63
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:32,223
Poetry is untranslatable,
like the whole of art.

64
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:39,313
You may be right
that poetry is untranslatable.

65
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:45,027
But music? Music for example...

66
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,537
What is it? What do you mean?

67
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,624
It's a Russian song.

68
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:06,591
You're right, but how could
we have got to know Tolstoy, Pushkin...

69
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,220
and so understand Russia?

70
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:21,731
You don't understand
anything about Russia.

71
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:26,277
Nor you Italy then.

72
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:32,241
If Dante, Petrarch
and Machiavelli are useless.

73
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:36,871
Sure.
It's impossible for us poor devils.

74
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,209
How can we get
to know each other?

75
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,754
By abolishing the frontiers.

76
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,714
Which?

77
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,260
Between states.

78
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,084
Good morning.

79
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,336
Good morning.

80
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:37,640
You know a maid in Milan
set fire to the house?

81
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,311
- Which house?
- Her employers' house.

82
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,273
- Why?
- She was homesick.

83
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,817
She missed her home
and family down South.

84
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,821
So she burned the thing
that stopped her going back.

85
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:58,703
Why did your musician, Sosnovsky,

86
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:04,000
go back to Russia
if he knew he'd be a slave again?

87
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:14,677
Why won't you confide in me?
I don't understand.

88
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:29,442
Read this. You'll understand.

89
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,027
What is it?

90
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,489
The letter from
the Bologna Conservatory?

91
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,078
I wanted to ask you,

92
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:45,333
was Sosnovsky successful
when he returned to Russia?

93
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,169
Was he happy?

94
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:56,552
He started drinking and then...

95
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,143
- He committed suicide?
- Exactly.

96
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:17,073
Here I am!
I'm sorry, I was asleep.

97
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,201
- Do you have any identification?
- Yes.

98
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,081
Here it is.

99
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,958
I'll go and get the keys.

100
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:34,131
Those aren't
the other hotel keys, I hope?

101
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,967
No, they're to my house.

102
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,608
Here's your key.

103
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,152
This way. Please.

104
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,377
<i>It's our best room.</i>

105
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,005
<i>Good night, Andrei.</i>

106
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,968
<i>Come with me.
Your room is upstairs.</i>

107
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,345
<i>It's nice here.</i>

108
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,891
<i>It's still night,
but the countryside's pretty too.</i>

109
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,977
<i>There's the river,
the mushrooms.</i>

110
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:35,317
People keep coming back,
they often fall in love here.

111
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,781
- You and your boyfriend will like it.
- He's not my boyfriend.

112
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:44,577
Go on, he's sad
because he's in love.

113
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,704
No, I think his mind's
on other things.

114
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:35,873
THE HOLY BIBLE

115
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:07,404
- Did you knock?
- I hadn't yet.

116
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:27,716
Shall I ask to call Moscow?

117
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,181
You haven't talked
to your wife for two days.

118
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,186
No, thanks.

119
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:19,601
One, two, three. Go!

120
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:54,496
<i>Andrei.</i>

121
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:13,640
Andrei, get up!
We'll be eating in half an hour.

122
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:17,394
I'll be downstairs.
It's lovely here.

123
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:21,565
- St. Catherine used to come too.
- I'm coming.

124
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:28,905
Excuse me, Miss.
What does this Russian do?

125
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:31,825
- He's a poet.
- Is he writing about Italy?

126
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,411
He's writing the biography
of a Russian musician.

127
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,080
- Zoe!
- And how come he is here?

128
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:42,085
This musician studied in Bologna
and came to these baths.

129
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,714
- When?
- At the end of the 1700s.

130
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:50,886
- Was it Tchaikovsky?
- No, his name was Sosnovsky.

131
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,597
- Wait.
- Didn't he marry a local woman?

132
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:59,019
No, he was in love
with a Russian slave and died for her.

133
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,229
What's the hurry?

134
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:10,197
- Does your poet like Italy?
- Too much so.

135
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,741
But... I don't know.

136
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:18,413
General, what's this strange music
we keep hearing day in and day out?

137
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:22,167
Wonderful music.
Beats Verdi anytime.

138
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:26,046
Hands off Verdi.
This is Chinese stuff.

139
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:29,341
A different civilization
with no sentimental wails.

140
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,760
Voice of God, of nature.

141
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:34,679
Pretend they're not there.

142
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,099
Just go on your way.

143
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:43,772
It's gotten into my mouth.
Move slowly.

144
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,942
- What does it taste like?
- It's a liquid sulfur.

145
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:51,279
- So it's good for the skin.
- Disgusting!

146
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:56,034
I'm fine. I'm falling asleep.

147
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:01,122
In the 60's a drowned body
was found here.

148
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:04,376
Don't talk about it,
otherwise I get scared.

149
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,254
In the war I've seen
thousands of dead soldiers.

150
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:10,215
Now listen,
it's never too late to learn

151
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:16,388
whatever happens,
don't interfere.

152
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:23,311
Have you heard their talk,
what they're interested in?

153
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,524
You've got to be different.

154
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,787
You know why they're
in the water?

155
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:46,167
They want to live forever.

156
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,631
Look who's here!

157
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:58,638
Look at them!

158
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:17,907
My cigar's gone out.
Hand me the lighter, please?

159
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,451
General!

160
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,328
Why do they make fun of him?

161
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:25,790
A few years ago, he shut himself up
in the house with his family

162
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:27,751
to wait for the end of the world.

163
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,295
They stayed in for seven years.

164
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:33,214
A religious fit, they say.

165
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:35,675
Nonsense. It was jealousy.

166
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:39,054
He was always jealous of his wife.

167
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:42,474
Later she ran off
with the children to Genoa.

168
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:46,936
Jealous my foot, he's nuts.

169
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,272
It's obvious.

170
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:54,736
That's not it,
he was just scared.

171
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:00,408
- Scared of what?
- Everything.

172
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:05,330
You're wrong,
he's a man of great faith.

173
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:09,668
And how, he kept his family
locked up for seven years.

174
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:13,755
I was there
when they broke down the door.

175
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:18,343
His kid shot out like a rat
and he chased after him.

176
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:22,347
We thought he wanted to kill him.
What faith!

177
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:25,558
Here's the Russian poet.

178
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:05,432
Miss, I don't smoke,
but could I have a cigarette?

179
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,435
Of course, as you don't smoke.

180
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,744
- It's gone out.
- So it has.

181
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,920
Thank you.

182
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:56,608
Never forget what he said to her.

183
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,194
He who?

184
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,780
And her?

185
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,618
Saint Catherine!

186
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,897
So what did God say
to St. Catherine?

187
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,781
"You are she who is not,

188
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:49,702
but I am he who is."

189
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,206
Did you hear that?

190
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,251
Bravo, Domenico!

191
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:05,885
Did he speak
to St. Catherine himself?

192
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:08,930
Be careful. He's not stupid.

193
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:13,017
Of course not.
Domenico has a degree.

194
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:14,143
In what?

195
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:16,896
I don't understand "Faith."
What is it?

196
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,899
Your Italian isn't so good, uh?

197
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,194
It was better
when you first came.

198
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:25,905
What does "faith" mean?

199
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:29,242
In Russian it's "Vera."

200
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:36,833
Why do they say he's mad?

201
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:40,044
He's not mad. He has faith.

202
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,298
There are lots of these lunatics
at large in Italy.

203
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:48,094
Asylums have been closed down
but the families won't have them.

204
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,805
And many must withdraw from others.

205
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,225
We don't know what madness is.

206
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:59,772
They're troublesome,
inconvenient

207
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,111
we refuse to understand them.

208
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:08,156
They're alone.

209
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:15,163
But they're certainly
closer to the truth.

210
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:18,958
He has another fixation now.

211
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:21,586
What?

212
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:27,175
He gets into the pool with
a lighted candle. Nobody knows why.

213
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:30,470
Everyone's afraid he wants
to drown himself

214
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:34,223
so they throw him out
and save him.

215
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,184
I don't believe it.

216
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:37,894
Ask them.

217
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:43,983
Can we ask him
to have lunch with us?

218
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:46,444
- When?
- Now.

219
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,655
Now, you don't know
what time it is.

220
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:51,324
- What time is it?
- It's 7:00 in the morning.

221
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,284
In the morning?

222
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:58,998
Does that man
with the wet shoes come often?

223
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:00,291
- Who? Domenico?
- Yes.

224
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:01,751
So this is what it's all about.

225
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,212
It depends. Sometimes he does,
sometimes he doesn't.

226
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:11,511
- Where does he live?
- Up above Bagno Vignoni.

227
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:14,430
In the square, near the church.

228
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,892
What's so funny?

229
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,729
Andrei!

230
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,238
- Stop.
- Why?

231
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,703
You're prettier...

232
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,497
in this light.

233
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,873
Redhead, redhead.

234
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:42,458
You think so?

235
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:59,267
I'm beginning to understand.

236
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:04,188
What?

237
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:11,446
Why do you think he locked up
his family for seven years?

238
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,165
How should I know?

239
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,188
There he is.

240
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:49,692
- Good-bye.
- Thank you.

241
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,611
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

242
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,752
Good morning.

243
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:14,300
I've brought a famous
Russian writer.

244
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:21,265
My life is normal,
there's nothing interesting about it.

245
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:26,062
It's true, but we hear
you had a lovely experience.

246
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:29,440
I read about it too,
in the papers.

247
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:32,360
Tell him about it.

248
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:34,862
It's not worth it.

249
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:45,790
Maybe not, but this gentleman
has come from Moscow.

250
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:47,708
For me?

251
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:51,921
He's come a long way.

252
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:08,479
- What did he say?
- He doesn't feel like talking.

253
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:10,940
- Let's go.
- What?

254
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,901
Try again, it's very important.

255
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:25,037
Excuse me?

256
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,918
- Stop for a minute.
- Go!

257
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,212
Look at that!

258
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:40,845
Where are you going?
What's wrong?

259
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:42,763
Have you offended him?

260
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,434
You've offended me!

261
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:50,771
He's crazy.
It's not up to me whether he talks or not.

262
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:53,024
I'm sorry, but I'm going.

263
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:55,651
If you care so much, try.

264
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:57,737
You know a bit of Italian.

265
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:01,782
If you don't like the way I work,
say so.

266
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:05,369
But believe me,
not only am I a good translator,

267
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:08,289
but I even improve
on the original.

268
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:13,294
I'm going back to Rome.
Our trip's over.

269
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:18,299
All right.

270
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:55,711
Excuse me.

271
00:45:56,545 --> 00:46:00,967
I think I know why you do that.

272
00:46:02,802 --> 00:46:04,136
What?

273
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:06,347
The bicycle?

274
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:11,686
Before, with your family.

275
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,612
I'm tired.

276
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,806
Where are you?

277
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:13,933
Come in!

278
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:40,621
Did you hear that?
It's Beethoven.

279
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:36,343
One drop plus one drop

280
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:39,346
makes a bigger drop, not two.

281
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,773
- May I?
- Smoke.

282
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:55,696
When I don't know what to say
I ask for a cigarette too.

283
00:51:57,323 --> 00:51:59,491
But I never learned to smoke.

284
00:52:00,576 --> 00:52:02,077
It's too hard.

285
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:11,378
You have to learn to not smoke,

286
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:14,089
to do important things.

287
00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:15,549
Such as?

288
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,612
Some wine?

289
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:32,055
We need bigger ideas.

290
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:33,807
What?

291
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,491
I was selfish before.

292
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:55,621
I wanted to save my family.

293
00:56:57,331 --> 00:57:01,460
Everyone must be saved,
the whole world.

294
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:02,878
How?

295
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:05,881
It's simple.

296
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:12,471
You see the candle?

297
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:14,890
All right.

298
00:57:15,891 --> 00:57:17,601
Why do you say "all right"?

299
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:19,519
Wait...

300
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,482
You're confusing me.

301
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:33,867
You need to cross the water
with the lighted candle.

302
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:38,038
- Which water?
- The hot water.

303
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:44,419
St. Catherine's pool,
by the hotel,

304
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:47,631
the steaming water.

305
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:50,467
All right, when?

306
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:52,552
Now...

307
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:57,474
I can't do it.

308
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,186
I don't want...

309
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:05,315
When I light the candle

310
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:08,610
and get into the water,

311
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,947
they pull me out.

312
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:15,784
They kick me out.

313
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:22,165
And they shout, "You're crazy!"

314
00:58:24,543 --> 00:58:26,044
Get it?

315
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:39,433
- All right.
- All right?

316
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:43,812
It's all wrong!

317
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,341
Help me.

318
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:19,306
- Help me.
- All right, but...

319
00:59:21,183 --> 00:59:22,684
Of course.

320
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:42,662
Where's the Russian
who's going to Bagno Vignoni?

321
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:45,665
The taxi's here.

322
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:23,870
It's late.

323
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:27,624
I must go.

324
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:33,588
Thank you.

325
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:02,492
Why me, of all people?

326
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:13,837
- You've children?
- Two, a girl and a boy.

327
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:18,091
And your wife? Is she pretty?

328
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,971
You know the Madonna
of Childbirth?

329
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:25,140
By Piero Della Francesca.

330
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:27,559
She's like that but all black.

331
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:32,939
Go with the candle.

332
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:39,738
We're planning
something big in Rome.

333
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:49,247
Zoe!

334
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:53,835
Where are you?

335
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:57,756
Zoe, answer me!

336
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:05,472
Zoe, you know I'm scared
of being alone.

337
01:02:06,473 --> 01:02:10,560
I know what you're thinking,
but that's enough now.

338
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:14,272
It's wrong to keep thinking
the same thing.

339
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:33,059
<i>What do you want?</i>

340
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:31,284
Dad.

341
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:36,748
Is this the end of the world?

342
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:03,108
Good morning. Are we going?

343
01:05:43,815 --> 01:05:46,401
Stand back!

344
01:05:52,532 --> 01:05:57,287
They're letting them out!
I knew they were in there.

345
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:59,372
I used to listen in secret.

346
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:27,734
The water had run out in my bathroom.
I hope you won't kill me.

347
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:37,076
- I thought you'd left.
- No, I'm still here.

348
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:41,664
- Good.
- You don't look pleased.

349
01:06:57,055 --> 01:06:58,097
Look.

350
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:01,017
Look what he gave me.

351
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:08,191
- Who?
- Domenico!

352
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:34,926
Why are you afraid
of everything?

353
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:38,221
Full of complexes.

354
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,642
You're not free.

355
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:47,647
You all seem to want freedom,
you talk about freedom...

356
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:52,318
but when you get it
you don't know what to do with it...

357
01:07:54,988 --> 01:07:56,864
or what it is.

358
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:05,331
That's enough, that's enough.

359
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:12,672
I know! It must be this country,
the air one breathes here.

360
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:17,302
Because in Moscow
I met some wonderful men.

361
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:24,559
What are you all after?

362
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:27,020
These? Here!

363
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:29,522
But not you.

364
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:32,900
You're a kind of saint.

365
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:36,029
You're interested in Madonnas.

366
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:39,532
No! You're different.

367
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:46,706
One "intellectual" tried
to keep me locked up.

368
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:52,295
Can't I ever meet the right man?

369
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:57,467
I don't mean you,
you're the worst.

370
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:03,640
But I swear I'll find
my kind of man.

371
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:07,352
And I have,
he's waiting for me in Rome.

372
01:09:08,603 --> 01:09:10,229
You dress badly too.

373
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:13,191
And you're boring.

374
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:18,196
Do you know what a boring man is?
I'll tell you.

375
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:21,824
You're the kind I'd sleep with
rather than explain why I don't feel like it.

376
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:24,077
What are you saying, Eugenia?

377
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:29,415
Don't you see?

378
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:36,422
I found myself
in a most embarrassing position.

379
01:09:42,762 --> 01:09:45,765
I've had enough!

380
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:48,601
I can't take any more!

381
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:56,234
I'd like to sleep for 10 days

382
01:09:56,818 --> 01:09:58,569
and wipe you out.

383
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:05,118
Maybe there's nothing to wipe out
because you don't exist.

384
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,455
It's my problem.

385
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:17,004
I know why I like idiots.
I mean...

386
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:20,341
Men with no charm, because...

387
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:26,889
I might look young,
but I know all about charm.

388
01:10:30,518 --> 01:10:32,311
Go, go, please.

389
01:10:35,106 --> 01:10:36,357
You know...

390
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:45,158
when I met you,
that same night...

391
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:50,329
I dreamt that a soft worm
with lots of legs...

392
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:53,374
fell on my head.

393
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:58,171
It stung me. it was poisonous.

394
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:01,132
I kept shaking my head

395
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:05,344
until it fell off.

396
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:08,681
I tried to squash it...

397
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:13,186
before it reached the wardrobe
but it was no good, because...

398
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:19,275
because I kept just missing it.

399
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:25,531
I just couldn't... squash it.

400
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:27,116
Since that night...

401
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:32,288
I keep touching my hair.

402
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:36,834
Thank God there's been
nothing between us!

403
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:43,716
Just the thought makes me sick!

404
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:53,100
She's insane.

405
01:11:56,395 --> 01:12:00,733
Run back to your wife!
Though you nearly betrayed her!

406
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:03,319
You're a pig, like everyone else.
Even worse...

407
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:13,246
Anything else?

408
01:12:13,621 --> 01:12:15,122
Hypocrite!

409
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:20,837
We're going to listen
to some music.

410
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:58,749
- What's going on?
- Nothing, nothing.

411
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:06,132
Oh, God!
Now the General and his Chinese music!

412
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:09,802
But you won't drive me away!

413
01:14:41,352 --> 01:14:43,813
<i>Dear Pyotr Nikolayevich,</i>

414
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:46,565
<i>I've been in Italy 2 years,</i>

415
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:49,235
<i>very important ones,</i>

416
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:54,490
<i>both for my profession as a musician
and for my everyday life.</i>

417
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:57,910
<i>Last night I had a bad dream,</i>

418
01:14:57,994 --> 01:15:03,207
<i>I had to stage an opera
in the theater of My Lord the Count.</i>

419
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:08,629
<i>The first act was set
in a park full of statues,</i>

420
01:15:08,713 --> 01:15:14,093
<i>but they were naked men painted
in white, forced to stand motionless.</i>

421
01:15:15,261 --> 01:15:18,097
<i>And I was a statue too.</i>

422
01:15:19,265 --> 01:15:24,603
<i>I knew I would be
harshly punished if I moved</i>

423
01:15:25,396 --> 01:15:30,109
<i>because our lord and master
was watching us.</i>

424
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:35,656
<i>I could feel the cold rising
from my marble pedestal...</i>

425
01:15:37,074 --> 01:15:42,163
<i>as the autumn leaves settled
on my upraised arm.</i>

426
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:45,833
<i>Yet I stood still.</i>

427
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:51,047
<i>But when, exhausted,
I sensed I could resist no longer,</i>

428
01:15:51,464 --> 01:15:52,923
<i>I awoke.</i>

429
01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:56,218
<i>I was afraid.</i>

430
01:15:56,594 --> 01:16:00,598
<i>For! knew it had been no dream,
but my reality.</i>

431
01:16:02,183 --> 01:16:07,146
<i>I could try not to return to Russia,
but the thought kills me.</i>

432
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:13,986
<i>Because I would die
if I never again saw my homeland...</i>

433
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:19,033
<i>the birches,
the air of my childhood...</i>

434
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:28,834
<i>An affectionate greeting
from your abandoned friend,</i>

435
01:16:29,502 --> 01:16:31,128
<i>Pavel Sosnovsky.</i>

436
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:51,315
<i>Maria.</i>

437
01:20:58,395 --> 01:20:59,897
<i>Andrei!</i>

438
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:38,727
<i>As a child I fell ill
from hunger and fear.</i>

439
01:21:38,811 --> 01:21:42,856
<i>I tear shreds of skin
from my lips.</i>

440
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:47,986
<i>In my memory I lick traces of salt,
of freshness.</i>

441
01:21:49,446 --> 01:21:52,908
<i>And still I walk.</i>

442
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:57,454
<i>I sit on a doorstep,
looking for warmth.</i>

443
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:05,212
<i>I stagger deliriously
as to the piper's tune.</i>

444
01:22:08,549 --> 01:22:13,345
<i>I was hot, I opened my collar
and I lay down.</i>

445
01:22:13,429 --> 01:22:17,558
<i>The trumpets sounded.
A light pierced my eyelids.</i>

446
01:22:17,975 --> 01:22:24,898
<i>High above the pavement mother flies,
beckons with her hand...</i>

447
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:28,944
<i>and flies</i> away.

448
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:37,035
<i>Now beneath the apple trees,
I dream of a white hospital.</i>

449
01:22:38,829 --> 01:22:40,664
<i>As a child I fell ill.</i>

450
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:12,029
<i>I must go and see Dad.</i>

451
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:22,456
<i>I have a jacket in the wardrobe.
It's been there three years.</i>

452
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:26,084
<i>I'll wear it again
when I'm home in Moscow.</i>

453
01:23:29,421 --> 01:23:32,424
<i>I never go anywhere,
I never see anyone.</i>

454
01:23:54,404 --> 01:23:56,448
What are you doing here?

455
01:23:57,616 --> 01:23:59,535
Don't be afraid.

456
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:11,088
Don't be afraid of me.
It's I who should be afraid of you.

457
01:24:12,548 --> 01:24:14,925
You could shoot me.

458
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:20,472
You know,
everyone shoots in Italy.

459
01:24:24,518 --> 01:24:28,772
And there are too many
Italian shoes.

460
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:35,320
Dreadful!

461
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:41,660
Everyone buys them. Why?

462
01:24:49,668 --> 01:24:53,505
These are 10 years old.

463
01:24:54,214 --> 01:24:55,966
It's not important.

464
01:25:01,847 --> 01:25:03,140
All right.

465
01:25:06,226 --> 01:25:11,356
You know the great love stories,
the classics. No kissing.

466
01:25:12,357 --> 01:25:15,694
No kissing. Nothing at all.

467
01:25:16,028 --> 01:25:17,404
Very pure.

468
01:25:19,573 --> 01:25:21,491
Hence great.

469
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:30,584
Feelings unspoken
are unforgettable.

470
01:25:40,886 --> 01:25:42,638
Here it's like in Russia.

471
01:25:46,433 --> 01:25:48,268
I don't know why.

472
01:25:52,898 --> 01:25:54,399
You know...

473
01:25:56,568 --> 01:25:59,071
I don't speak Italian well.

474
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:08,538
Here's a story.

475
01:26:09,873 --> 01:26:16,254
A man saves another
who was sinking into a slimy pond...

476
01:26:18,924 --> 01:26:21,176
thereby risking his own life.

477
01:26:24,137 --> 01:26:28,475
Now they are both lying
on the edge of the pond

478
01:26:29,643 --> 01:26:31,561
out of breath, exhausted.

479
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:42,614
The rescued man says, "Idiot.

480
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:49,413
Why did you do that?
I live in there!"

481
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,669
I live in there.

482
01:26:56,628 --> 01:26:58,338
He took great offense.

483
01:27:04,136 --> 01:27:06,805
- What's your name?
- Angela.

484
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:11,727
Angela, good girl.

485
01:27:14,146 --> 01:27:15,647
Are you happy?

486
01:27:16,565 --> 01:27:18,066
About what?

487
01:27:19,025 --> 01:27:20,569
About life.

488
01:27:21,695 --> 01:27:23,363
About life, yes.

489
01:27:32,664 --> 01:27:34,166
Good girl.

490
01:28:07,657 --> 01:28:09,618
<i>Sight grows dim,</i>

491
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:14,873
<i>my strength is two occult,
adamantine darts.</i>

492
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:21,296
<i>Hearing weavers for my father's house
breathes distant thunder.</i>

493
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:25,550
<i>The tissues of hard muscles weaken</i>

494
01:28:26,176 --> 01:28:28,428
<i>like hoary oxen at the plow</i>

495
01:28:28,512 --> 01:28:33,433
<i>and no longer when night falls
do two wings gleam behind me.</i>

496
01:28:34,726 --> 01:28:39,815
<i>During the party,
like a candle I wasted away.</i>

497
01:28:40,774 --> 01:28:43,860
<i>Gather up at dawn my melted wax</i>

498
01:28:44,653 --> 01:28:49,783
<i>and read in it whom to mourn,
what to be proud of.</i>

499
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:54,663
<i>How, by donating
the last portion of joy</i>

500
01:28:55,539 --> 01:29:01,253
<i>to die lightly and in the shelter
of a makeshift roof</i>

501
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:05,382
<i>to light up posthumously,
like a word.</i>

502
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:05,502
<i>Why must I think of this?</i>

503
01:31:06,419 --> 01:31:08,338
<i>I have enough worries.</i>

504
01:31:11,049 --> 01:31:14,010
<i>My God, why did I do it?</i>

505
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:19,140
<i>They're my children, my family,
my own flesh and blood.</i>

506
01:31:21,726 --> 01:31:23,353
<i>How could I?</i>

507
01:31:26,398 --> 01:31:31,444
<i>Years without seeing the sun,
fearing the light of day.</i>

508
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,697
<i>Why?</i>

509
01:31:34,614 --> 01:31:36,282
<i>Why this tragedy?</i>

510
01:33:22,847 --> 01:33:26,017
<i>Lord, do you see how he's asking?</i>

511
01:33:26,684 --> 01:33:28,686
<i>Say something to him.</i>

512
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:32,190
<i>But what would happen
if He heard my voice?</i>

513
01:33:32,899 --> 01:33:34,943
<i>Let Him feel your presence.</i>

514
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:39,364
<i>I always do,
but He's not aware of it.</i>

515
01:36:29,534 --> 01:36:33,705
I'll bring the car around
in 10 minutes.

516
01:36:34,372 --> 01:36:37,375
Mr. Gorchakov,
phone call for you.

517
01:36:38,084 --> 01:36:40,044
- For me?
- Yes.

518
01:36:44,841 --> 01:36:46,926
Please, wait a minute.

519
01:36:52,974 --> 01:36:55,560
- In the lobby.
- Thank you.

520
01:37:00,064 --> 01:37:01,399
Hello?

521
01:37:02,734 --> 01:37:04,319
It's Eugenia.

522
01:37:05,278 --> 01:37:08,698
<i>- How are you?</i>
- Fine.

523
01:37:09,741 --> 01:37:11,993
- Guess why I called?
<i>- Maybe because...</i>

524
01:37:12,076 --> 01:37:14,037
No, no...

525
01:37:14,454 --> 01:37:18,499
Your Domenico is here,
the lunatic from Bagno Vignoni.

526
01:37:19,459 --> 01:37:24,172
Sorry, I know he's not mad.
It was so you'd understand.

527
01:37:24,839 --> 01:37:27,383
He's here in Rome
for a demonstration.

528
01:37:27,759 --> 01:37:29,552
They do weird things.

529
01:37:29,635 --> 01:37:31,679
He's been making speeches
for three days.

530
01:37:31,763 --> 01:37:33,598
Like Fidel Castro.

531
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:37,769
- Come and say good-bye to him.
<i>- I'm leaving.</i>

532
01:37:37,852 --> 01:37:40,271
- When?
<i>- Immediately.</i>

533
01:37:40,938 --> 01:37:43,691
Domenico asked me about you.

534
01:37:43,775 --> 01:37:46,694
He keeps asking if you've done
what you were supposed to do.

535
01:37:46,778 --> 01:37:48,488
<i>Of course.</i>

536
01:37:48,571 --> 01:37:52,200
I'll tell him right away,
he's been waiting for this news.

537
01:37:52,283 --> 01:37:53,409
<i>Thank you.</i>

538
01:37:53,493 --> 01:37:55,661
I'm glad we could say good-bye.

539
01:37:56,704 --> 01:37:59,582
I'm leaving too, you know?
I'm going away with Vittorio.

540
01:38:00,249 --> 01:38:04,128
We haven't decided yet,
but we'll probably go to India.

541
01:38:05,129 --> 01:38:06,672
Vittorio's my man,

542
01:38:06,756 --> 01:38:09,175
he's interested in spiritual issues.

543
01:38:09,425 --> 01:38:11,594
He's from a distinguished family
in Orvieto.

544
01:38:11,969 --> 01:38:16,682
<i>Good, Eugenia,
I wish you all the best.</i>

545
01:38:16,766 --> 01:38:20,228
Same to you.
Say hello to Moscow for me.

546
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:24,065
How's your health?

547
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:26,734
How's your heart?

548
01:38:27,110 --> 01:38:30,613
<i>I don't know,
I've reached the limit.</i>

549
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:34,409
<i>I'm bored.</i>

550
01:38:36,619 --> 01:38:38,621
<i>I want to go home.</i>

551
01:38:46,421 --> 01:38:48,548
Good-bye, Vittorio.

552
01:39:16,284 --> 01:39:18,619
I'm going to buy some cigarettes.

553
01:40:18,554 --> 01:40:24,268
I want to change my ticket.
I'm leaving in two days' time.

554
01:40:25,269 --> 01:40:28,189
- What's happened?
- Nothing.

555
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:34,904
Can you drive me
to Bagno Vignoni?

556
01:40:35,571 --> 01:40:37,156
- When?
- Now.

557
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:40,284
- Yes, but we'll have to advise --
- Right.

558
01:40:42,954 --> 01:40:45,748
- I wait, right?
- Right.

559
01:40:48,501 --> 01:40:51,379
I had a feeling
you wouldn't leave today.

560
01:42:46,243 --> 01:42:48,537
What ancestor speaks in me?

561
01:42:48,913 --> 01:42:52,583
I can't live simultaneously

562
01:42:52,792 --> 01:42:55,252
in my head and in my body.

563
01:42:55,336 --> 01:42:59,924
That's why I can't be
just one person.

564
01:43:00,549 --> 01:43:06,097
I'm capable of feeling an infinite number
of things at the same time.

565
01:43:07,098 --> 01:43:13,896
There are no great masters left.
That's the real evil of our time.

566
01:43:13,979 --> 01:43:18,067
The heart's path is covered
in shadow.

567
01:43:18,150 --> 01:43:25,408
We must listen to the voices
that seem useless.

568
01:43:25,491 --> 01:43:30,079
In brains full
of long sewage pipes

569
01:43:30,162 --> 01:43:34,125
of school wall,
tarmac and welfare papers

570
01:43:34,208 --> 01:43:39,797
the buzzing of insects
must enter.

571
01:43:40,131 --> 01:43:43,801
We must fill the eyes
and ears of all of us

572
01:43:43,884 --> 01:43:48,389
with things that are
the beginning of a great dream.

573
01:43:48,472 --> 01:43:52,810
Someone must shout that
we'll build the pyramids.

574
01:43:52,893 --> 01:43:56,063
It doesn't matter if we don't.

575
01:43:56,147 --> 01:43:59,650
We must fuel that wish...

576
01:44:00,818 --> 01:44:05,322
and stretch the corners of the soul,

577
01:44:05,406 --> 01:44:10,786
like an endless sheet.

578
01:44:12,079 --> 01:44:16,333
If you want the world to go forward...

579
01:44:17,418 --> 01:44:20,212
we must hold hands...

580
01:44:21,464 --> 01:44:27,803
We must mix the so-called healthy
with the so-called sick.

581
01:44:28,929 --> 01:44:34,226
You healthy ones!
What does your health mean?

582
01:44:35,478 --> 01:44:40,274
The eyes of all mankind
are looking at the pit

583
01:44:40,566 --> 01:44:43,527
into which we are plunging.

584
01:44:45,029 --> 01:44:47,531
Freedom is useless

585
01:44:48,365 --> 01:44:52,912
if you don't have the courage
to look us in the eye,

586
01:44:53,871 --> 01:44:59,418
to eat, drink,
and sleep with us.

587
01:45:00,586 --> 01:45:03,756
It's the so-called healthy

588
01:45:04,715 --> 01:45:10,387
who have brought the world
to the verge of ruin.

589
01:45:15,434 --> 01:45:18,395
Man, listen!

590
01:45:19,522 --> 01:45:26,695
In you, water,
fire and then ashes.

591
01:45:26,779 --> 01:45:28,447
WERE NOT CRAZY
WE'RE SERIOUS

592
01:45:28,531 --> 01:45:31,325
And the bones in the ashes.

593
01:45:32,409 --> 01:45:36,497
The bones and the ashes.

594
01:46:32,845 --> 01:46:35,806
Wait for me in the car.

595
01:46:44,899 --> 01:46:46,233
Hello.

596
01:48:15,572 --> 01:48:22,579
Where am I when I'm not
in reality or in my imagination?

597
01:48:24,081 --> 01:48:26,417
Here's my new pact with the world:

598
01:48:27,084 --> 01:48:31,672
It must be sunny at night
and snowy in August.

599
01:48:32,047 --> 01:48:36,802
Great things end,
small things endure.

600
01:48:39,263 --> 01:48:45,352
Society must become united again,
instead of so disjointed.

601
01:48:46,937 --> 01:48:52,026
Just look at nature
and you'll see that life is simple.

602
01:48:52,860 --> 01:48:55,988
We must go back
to where we were,

603
01:48:56,780 --> 01:49:03,579
to the point
where you took the wrong turn.

604
01:49:06,957 --> 01:49:12,337
We must go back
to the main foundations of life...

605
01:49:13,714 --> 01:49:16,133
without dirtying the water.

606
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:21,221
What kind of world is this,

607
01:49:21,972 --> 01:49:24,308
if a madman tells you...

608
01:49:25,642 --> 01:49:29,104
you must be ashamed
of yourselves!

609
01:49:31,899 --> 01:49:33,650
Music now.

610
01:49:36,653 --> 01:49:38,489
- Music!
- Music!

611
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:05,682
I forgot this.

612
01:50:16,527 --> 01:50:19,571
Oh, mother!

613
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:24,368
The air is that light thing...

614
01:50:25,619 --> 01:50:28,622
that moves around your head

615
01:50:29,456 --> 01:50:33,752
and becomes clearer
when you laugh.

616
01:51:15,252 --> 01:51:18,297
The music doesn't work!

617
01:52:52,683 --> 01:52:55,686
TOMORROW IS THE END
OF THE WORLD

618
02:05:24,142 --> 02:05:32,400
To the memory of my mother.
