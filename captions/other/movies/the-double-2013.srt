192
00:19:12,899 --> 00:19:16,898
he would have landed on that awning if
he'd just jumped a few feet to the right.

193
00:19:16,899 --> 00:19:20,631

have fallen, bounced off

194

195
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:25,031

I'd more confronted him.

236
00:21:35,332 --> 00:21:37,898
He was this person who'd been
following me around for a while,

237
00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:39,731
and I'd always see him,
no matter where I went...

238
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:42,931
Like at the office, on the
subway, by my apartment.

thing by the apartments?

He'd just be there, watching.

But then I found out that he lived above
me and I thought, "that's really odd."

244
00:21:56,365 --> 00:21:58,865
Like, did he follow me around because
he lived in the same building as me

245
00:21:58,866 --> 00:22:01,765
<i>and he got fixated? Or did he
get fixated and then move in?</i>

thought, "you know what?</i>

247
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:06,531
Enough is enough." Because it was
actually getting frightening.

248
00:22:06,532 --> 00:22:09,898
Well, like a little bit frightening. It
was more annoying than frightening, so...

249
00:22:09,899 --> 00:22:12,564
I went up to him and he looked
over his shoulder at me

250
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:15,098
as if to say, "who, me?"
Like he hadn't been stalking me.

251
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:18,431
