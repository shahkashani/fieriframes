1
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:35,201
When the child was a child,
it walked with its arms swinging.

2
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:40,123
It wanted the stream to be a river,
the river a torrent...

3
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:44,419
and this puddle to be the sea.

4
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:49,090
When the child was a child,
it didn't know it was a child.

5
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:54,679
Everything was full of life,
and all life was one.

6
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:59,684
When the child was a child,
it had no opinion about anything.

7
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,269
It had no habits.

8
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:05,398
It often sat cross-legged,
took off running...

9
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:10,612
had a cowlick in its hair,
and didn't pull a face...

10
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,614
when photographed.

11
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,026
Look.

12
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:31,920
The consolation of lifting one's head
out here in the open...

13
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:36,091
of seeing the colours
enlightened by the sun...

14
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,344
in all men's eyes.

15
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,348
At last mad, no longer alone.

16
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:48,353
At last mad, at last redeemed.
At last mad, at last at peace.

17
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,855
At last an internal light.

18
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:56,236
We're approaching Berlin Tegel, the
no-smoking sign has been turned on.

19
00:03:56,444 --> 00:04:00,824
Please stop smoking
until you're inside the airport.

20
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:22,053
There's a little house
with two floors and a terrace.

21
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,724
And every day we go bathing.

22
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,060
The man who lives there
is called Peter...

23
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,166
Pretty picture.

24
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:27,429
Nothing good to see on TV.

25
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:34,728
You stumble over your colours,
and are never punctual.

26
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:52,245
Still the same smell. But dustier.
She collected everything.

27
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:55,123
Stamps, postcards.

28
00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:01,254
Even U-Bahn tickets.
She never threw anything away.

29
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:06,092
Mother. My mother.
She never was.

30
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:09,846
My father...
My father was my father.

31
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:15,810
She is dead.
No tears, no grief. Maybe later.

32
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:21,649
Dependant on everybody.
My sister. I have to get out of here.

33
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:50,679
She's never loved me.
And you also just pretend.

34
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,556
Be glad that they forgot about you.

35
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:57,894
Want to die immediately,
don't want to go on living.

36
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:08,697
My God, what will become of the boy?
He's only got music on his mind.

37
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,870
What does he want now?

38
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:21,501
I already bought him a guitar.
Does he wants drums now?

39
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:30,677
I'm slowly getting fed up with it.
Won't he ever grow up?

40
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:38,101
No really, I'm getting fed up.
I don't want to go on with this.

41
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:45,275
No really, this has to stop some time.
I can't help him any more.

42
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:50,905
No wonder, he only learnt rock 'n' roll.

43
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:56,119
Maybe he'll get a grip on himself
one day.

44
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:13,136
When the child was a child,
it was the time of these questions:

45
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:18,058
Why am I me, and why not you?

46
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:22,979
Why am I here, and why not there?

47
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:28,401
When did time begin,
and where does space end?

48
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,822
Isn't life under the sun
just a dream?

49
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:42,207
Isn't what I see, hear and smell just a
mirage of the world before the world?

50
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:48,004
Does evil actually exist,
and people who are really evil?

51
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:57,889
How can it be that I, the one I am,
wasn't there before I was there...

52
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:05,772
and that some time I, the one I am,
no longer will be the one I am?

53
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:14,656
The child needs oxygen.
Breathe deep down.

54
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:18,076
If I could only suffer in her place.
- It hurts.

55
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:23,540
It'll be over soon.
- It's almost over.

56
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:30,338
Poor little mite, I'm anxious to see you.
I wonder what you look like.

57
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:36,636
You bastard. You bastard.
- Women will fuck up your life.

58
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:42,684
Blackie, I think I got lost.
We wanted to go to the cemetery...

59
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:14,924
Well?

60
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:28,021
Sunrise at 7.22 am, sunset at 4.28 pm.
Moonrise at 7.04 pm, moonset...

61
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,774
Level of the Havel and the Spree...

62
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:36,780
20 years ago today, a Soviet jet fighter
crashed into the lakes at Spandau.

63
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:41,076
50 years ago, there were...
- The Olympic Games.

64
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:47,207
200 years ago,
the first balloon flew over the city.

65
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,711
Like the fugitives the other day.
- And today...

66
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,382
Lilienthaler Chaussee:
A man slows down...

67
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,219
and looks over his shoulder
into space.

68
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:03,765
Someone who wants
to put an end to it...

69
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,935
put first-issue stamps
on his farewell letters.

70
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,520
A different one on each.

71
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:13,566
Then he spoke English
with an American soldier...

72
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:17,987
for the first time since his schooldays,
fluently.

73
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:25,578
Just before dashing his head against
the wall, a prisoner said: "Now."

74
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:29,332
Instead of the station's name,
the guard...

75
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:33,294
suddenly shouted: "Tierra del Fuego."
- Nice.

76
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:36,798
An old man was reading
the Odyssey to a child...

77
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:42,012
and the young listener
stopped blinking his eyes.

78
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,723
And what do you have to tell?

79
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:54,065
A passer-by who, in the rain,
folded her umbrella and was drenched.

80
00:12:55,608 --> 00:13:01,573
A schoolboy who described
to his teacher a fern growing...

81
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,284
and the astounded teacher.

82
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:11,166
A blind woman, who groped her watch,
feeling my presence.

83
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:16,880
It's great to live by the spirit,
to testify for eternity...

84
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:20,759
only what is spiritual
in people's minds.

85
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:26,181
But sometimes I'm fed up
with my spiritual existence...

86
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,350
of forever hovering above.

87
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,977
I'd like to feel a weight in me...

88
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:34,814
to end the infinity,
and to tie me to earth.

89
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:39,027
I'd like at each step,
each gust of wind...

90
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,947
to be able to say:
"Now, now and now."

91
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,867
No longer:
"Forever" and "For eternity".

92
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:50,914
Sit at the empty place at a card table,
be greeted...

93
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:53,291
even by a nod.

94
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:58,713
Every time we participated,
it was a pretence.

95
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,511
Wrestling, allowing a hip to be put out,
in pretence...

96
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:07,055
catching a fish in pretence.

97
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:12,769
In pretence, sitting at tables
drinking and eating in pretence.

98
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:18,191
Having lambs roasted and wine served
in the tents in the desert...

99
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,276
only in pretence.

100
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:25,156
I don't have to beget a child
or plant a tree...

101
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:29,911
but it would be nice,
coming home after a long day...

102
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,040
to feed the cat like Philip Marlowe...

103
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:38,753
to have a fever,
blackened fingers from the newspaper.

104
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:44,843
To be excited not only by the mind,
but by a meal.

105
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:50,015
By the line of a neck, by an ear.

106
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,269
To lie.

107
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,771
Through one's teeth.

108
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,775
As you're walking,
to feel your bones moving along.

109
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:04,279
At last to guess
instead of always knowing.

110
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:09,659
To be able to say:
"Ah" and "Oh" and "Hey"...

111
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:13,538
instead of: "Yes and amen."
- Yes.

112
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,916
To be able to enthuse for evil...

113
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:21,004
to draw all the demons
from the passers-by...

114
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:24,215
and to chase them out into the world.

115
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,718
To be a savage.

116
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:33,475
Or to feel how it is to take off
your shoes under the table...

117
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:38,605
and to wriggle your toes, barefoot,
like that...

118
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,319
Stay alone.

119
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:48,198
Let things happen. Keep serious.

120
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:53,286
We can only be savages
in as much as we keep serious.

121
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:58,625
Do no more than look.
Assemble, testify, preserve.

122
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:05,507
Remain spirit.
Keep your distance. Keep your word.

123
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:10,303
Look, a convertible.
You don't buy that, you steal it.

124
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,889
Or it's stolen from you.
- Imagine...

125
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:17,394
Open the roof, leave the smog behind.
- In a pimpmobile.

126
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:09,769
Tell me, muse, the storyteller...

127
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:14,065
he who has been thrust
to the edge of the world...

128
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:21,448
both an infant and an ancient,
and through him reveal Everyman.

129
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:36,087
With time, those who listened to me
became my readers.

130
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:40,050
They no longer sit in a circle,
but apart...

131
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:44,179
and one doesn't know anything
about the other.

132
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:54,731
I'm an old man,
with a broken voice...

133
00:21:54,939 --> 00:22:00,028
but the story
still rises from the depths...

134
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:03,031
and the slowly opened mouth...

135
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:07,619
repeats it as clearly
as it does powerfully.

136
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:13,541
A liturgy for which no one
needs to be initiated...

137
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:18,171
to the meaning
of the words and sentences.

138
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:32,352
Maybe she doesn't have the money
to see another doctor.

139
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:37,774
4 years since I saw her,
she's been sick for 2.

140
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:42,862
When will you pray with your
own words, and not for eternal life?

141
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:48,618
And then these young girls
make eyes at men...

142
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:52,914
So why am I living? Why am I living?

143
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:02,882
How will I pay?
With my small pension.

144
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,398
You're lost,
it can go on for a long time.

145
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:21,359
Abandoned by parents,
betrayed by wife.

146
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:25,822
Friend in another town,
your children only recall your stutter.

147
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:30,410
You could hit yourself
as you look in the mirror.

148
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:35,373
What's that?
What's going on?

149
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:40,128
I'm still there.
If I want it, if I only want it.

150
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:45,216
I must want it,
then I can get out of it again.

151
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:48,762
I let myself go,
I can drag myself out again.

152
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,639
Of course, mother was right.

153
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:06,154
Hey, two Marks.
- No, it's a beer top.

154
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:08,490
Nonsense, let's pull it up.

155
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:14,704
Only 10 Pfennigs.

156
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:22,045
" You bet?" was great last night.
- It wasn't on last night.

157
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:25,215
A few days ago, or a month...

158
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:33,139
I'm all alone,
just mad on my own...

159
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:37,894
three at play, that'll be the day.

160
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:52,492
5 years ago.
- And they lived happily ever after.

161
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:16,599
Marion, not like that. Mon dieu.

162
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:22,480
What is this?
With a swing, not with force.

163
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:26,651
What are you doing?
Don't dangle, fly.

164
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:31,072
You are an angel.
- For heaven's sake.

165
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:35,118
And for my sake, too.

166
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:39,622
I can't fly with these things.
- Yes, you can.

167
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:45,837
It's easier with wings than without.
- Not with these chicken feathers.

168
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:50,884
What did she say?
- These wings bother her.

169
00:25:53,636 --> 00:26:01,561
Marion, just imagine you're a dove.
- You bunch of sparrows.

170
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:07,025
What are you playing at?
Sounds like a firemen's ball.

171
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:12,072
That's enough.
Concentrate, Marion.

172
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,367
She works hard
with those chicken feathers.

173
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:20,121
Marion, make an effort.
- Make an effort.

174
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:25,085
Of course, I make an effort.
What do you think I'm doing?

175
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:32,175
I'd have fallen on your heads long ago,
if I didn't make an effort.

176
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:40,392
One moment, please.

177
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:46,773
Hold everything. We can't pay the rent
and the electricity.

178
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:48,358
We're broke.

179
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:56,324
So tomorrow we'll take things down,
pull the caravans to winter quarters.

180
00:26:56,533 --> 00:27:02,414
The bailiff's been.
This is it for the circus this year.

181
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:04,332
I'm sorry.

182
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:07,836
It's over. Not even a season.

183
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:12,257
Once again,
no time to bring something to an end.

184
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:17,220
Tonight the last night
of my good old number.

185
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:19,180
And it's a full moon.

186
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:24,477
And the trapeze artist
comes tumbling down...

187
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:26,896
Tais-toi. Be quiet.

188
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:33,361
I never imagined it like that,
the farewell to the circus.

189
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:39,951
The last evening, no one shows up,
you play like fools...

190
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:44,539
and I fly around the ring
like a poor chicken.

191
00:27:45,957 --> 00:27:52,881
And then I'm a waitress again.
Merde.

192
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:58,803
Moments like that,
like right now...

193
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:02,766
a beautiful memory
in 10 years time.

194
00:28:02,974 --> 00:28:09,439
Time will heal everything,
but what if time was the illness?

195
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:13,985
As if sometimes one had to lean over
to go on living.

196
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:18,948
To live... A look is enough.

197
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:21,910
The circus... I'll miss it.

198
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:26,581
It's funny.
It's the end, and I don't feel a thing.

199
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,500
An angel passes by.

200
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:32,504
I must stop
having a bad conscience.

201
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:41,471
As if pain had no past.

202
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,849
It always stops
when it's only just starting...

203
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:48,228
to be too good to be true.

204
00:28:48,436 --> 00:28:51,022
At last outside, in the city.

205
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:56,152
Find out who I am,
who I have become.

206
00:28:56,361 --> 00:29:01,157
Most of the time,
I'm too aware to be sad.

207
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:07,414
I waited an eternity
to hear a loving word.

208
00:29:07,622 --> 00:29:09,833
Then I went abroad.

209
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:15,255
Someone who'd say:
"I love you so much today."

210
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:20,260
That would be wonderful.

211
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:26,433
I look up and the world
appears before my eyes...

212
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:29,436
and fills my heart.

213
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:37,777
As a child,
I wanted to live on an island.

214
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:44,034
A woman alone, gloriously alone.

215
00:29:45,952 --> 00:29:48,204
Yes, that's it.

216
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:05,096
Everything so empty, incompatible.

217
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:09,267
Emptiness, fear.

218
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:13,104
La peur, la peur, la peur...

219
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:14,689
Fear.

220
00:30:19,694 --> 00:30:23,865
Like a small animal,
lost in the woods.

221
00:30:24,074 --> 00:30:26,951
Who are you?
I don't know any more.

222
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:32,749
But I do know:
I will no longer be a trapeze artist.

223
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:44,511
Must not cry. That's how it is.

224
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:49,599
It happens,
not always as you'd like it.

225
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:54,104
Emptiness, such emptiness...

226
00:31:42,694 --> 00:31:44,571
What shall I do?

227
00:31:47,782 --> 00:31:52,287
Not think any more.
Just be there.

228
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:58,835
Berlin... Here I'm a stranger,
and yet it's all so familiar.

229
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:04,049
You can't get lost,
you always end up at the Wall.

230
00:32:04,257 --> 00:32:10,722
I'm waiting for my photo at a machine,
and it comes out with another face.

231
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:14,601
That could be the beginning of a story.

232
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:19,272
The faces... I'd like to see faces.

233
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:22,734
Maybe I'll find a job as a waitress.

234
00:32:34,621 --> 00:32:37,540
This evening scares me.

235
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:41,294
It's silly, fear makes me sick.

236
00:32:41,503 --> 00:32:46,925
Only part of me worries,
the other part doesn't believe in it.

237
00:32:50,845 --> 00:32:56,518
How should I live?
Maybe that's not the question.

238
00:32:56,726 --> 00:32:59,437
How should I think?

239
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:11,324
I know so little. Maybe
because I'm always just curious.

240
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:13,827
Sometimes I think so wrongly...

241
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:19,249
because I'm thinking
as if I was talking to someone else.

242
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:29,300
Inside closed eyes,
close the eyes again.

243
00:33:30,427 --> 00:33:33,304
Then even the stones come alive.

244
00:34:12,677 --> 00:34:15,347
To be with the colours.

245
00:34:15,555 --> 00:34:18,892
Les couleurs. The colours.

246
00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:28,068
Neon lights in the evening sky,
the red and yellow S-Bahn.

247
00:34:32,947 --> 00:34:37,827
Longing... longing.

248
00:34:38,036 --> 00:34:41,414
I only need to be ready.

249
00:34:42,749 --> 00:34:47,671
Longing for a wave of love
that would stir in me.

250
00:34:50,882 --> 00:34:57,263
That's what makes me clumsy,
the absence of desire.

251
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:06,648
Desire to love.

252
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:18,118
Desire to love.

253
00:36:04,581 --> 00:36:08,668
Don't stare.
Have you never seen anyone die?

254
00:36:08,877 --> 00:36:14,215
I stink of gasoline.
I can't just... It was all so clear.

255
00:36:14,424 --> 00:36:18,178
The way they're standing there,
staring at me.

256
00:36:18,386 --> 00:36:22,766
I should have told her yesterday
that I'm sorry...

257
00:36:22,974 --> 00:36:28,897
I can't simply...
I've still got so much to do...

258
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:34,027
As I came up the mountain
out of the misty valley into the sun...

259
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:42,035
The fire on the cattle range,
the potatoes in the ashes...

260
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:46,915
the boathouse floating on the lake.

261
00:36:47,123 --> 00:36:52,462
The Southern Cross. The Far East.

262
00:36:52,671 --> 00:36:59,469
The Great North. The Wild West.

263
00:36:59,678 --> 00:37:07,602
The Great Bear Lake.
The Tristan de Cunha Island.

264
00:37:08,937 --> 00:37:15,735
The Mississippi Delta. Stromboli.

265
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:24,285
The old houses of Charlottenburg.
Albert Camus.

266
00:37:26,538 --> 00:37:33,253
The morning light.
The eyes of the child.

267
00:37:35,005 --> 00:37:38,466
Swimming near the waterfall.

268
00:37:40,093 --> 00:37:46,683
The spots of the first drops of rain.
The sun.

269
00:37:46,891 --> 00:37:53,064
The bread and wine. Hopping.

270
00:37:53,273 --> 00:37:59,195
Easter. The veins of the leaves.

271
00:37:59,404 --> 00:38:05,869
The blowing grass.
The colours of the stones.

272
00:38:06,077 --> 00:38:10,790
The pebbles on the stream's bed.

273
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:14,669
The white tablecloth outdoors.

274
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:18,840
The dream of the house in the house.

275
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:23,219
The dear one asleep
in the next room.

276
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:29,351
The peaceful Sunday.
The horizon.

277
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:33,730
The light from the room
in the garden.

278
00:38:33,938 --> 00:38:40,195
The night flight.
Riding a bicycle with no hands.

279
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:44,449
The beautiful stranger.

280
00:38:45,867 --> 00:38:47,243
My father.

281
00:38:49,454 --> 00:38:50,830
My mother.

282
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:54,459
My wife.

283
00:38:56,795 --> 00:38:58,171
My child.

284
00:39:15,146 --> 00:39:20,026
The world seems to be sinking
into dust, but I recount...

285
00:39:20,235 --> 00:39:22,028
as in the beginning...

286
00:39:22,237 --> 00:39:25,865
in my sing-song voice,
which sustains me...

287
00:39:26,074 --> 00:39:30,453
saved by the tale
from present troubles...

288
00:39:30,662 --> 00:39:34,624
and protected for the future.

289
00:39:48,471 --> 00:39:54,561
Finished with the sweeping
over the centuries as in the past.

290
00:39:54,769 --> 00:39:59,524
Now I can think only day by day.

291
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:05,613
My heroes are no longer
the warriors and kings...

292
00:40:05,822 --> 00:40:12,787
but the things of peace,
one equal to the other.

293
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:20,420
The drying onions equal
to the tree trunk crossing the marsh.

294
00:40:20,628 --> 00:40:28,887
But no one has so far succeeded
in singing an epic of peace.

295
00:40:29,095 --> 00:40:35,101
What is wrong with peace
that its inspiration doesn't endure...

296
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:41,608
and that its story is hardly told?

297
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:49,157
Must I give up now?

298
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:54,579
If I do give up,
then mankind will lose its storyteller.

299
00:40:54,788 --> 00:40:58,958
And once mankind
loses its storyteller...

300
00:40:59,167 --> 00:41:03,046
it will also lose its childhood.

301
00:41:12,847 --> 00:41:18,228
I cannot find the Potsdamer Platz.

302
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:26,861
Here? This can't be it.

303
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:32,867
Potsdamer Platz,
that's where Cafz Josti used to be.

304
00:41:33,076 --> 00:41:40,041
In the afternoons, I went there
to chat and to drink a coffee...

305
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,168
and to watch the crowd.

306
00:41:42,377 --> 00:41:46,297
Before that I smoked my cigar
at Loese and Wolf...

307
00:41:46,506 --> 00:41:49,968
a renowned tobacconist.

308
00:41:50,176 --> 00:41:52,178
Just across from here.

309
00:41:53,304 --> 00:42:00,186
This can't be the Potsdamer Platz.

310
00:42:01,438 --> 00:42:07,360
And no one whom you can ask.

311
00:42:09,029 --> 00:42:17,203
It was a lively place.
Tramways, horse-drawn carriages...

312
00:42:17,412 --> 00:42:24,294
and two cars:
mine and that of the chocolate shop.

313
00:42:25,712 --> 00:42:30,258
The Wertheim store was here, too.

314
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:37,307
And then suddenly,
the flags appeared.

315
00:42:37,515 --> 00:42:39,309
Here...

316
00:42:40,727 --> 00:42:45,648
The whole Platz
was covered with them.

317
00:42:45,857 --> 00:42:51,488
And the people
weren't friendly anymore...

318
00:42:51,696 --> 00:42:55,825
and the police wasn't either.

319
00:42:56,034 --> 00:42:59,954
I will not give up...

320
00:43:00,163 --> 00:43:05,335
as long as I haven't found
the Potsdamer Platz.

321
00:43:10,423 --> 00:43:15,095
Where are my heroes?
Where are you, my children?

322
00:43:15,303 --> 00:43:20,350
Where are my own, the dull-witted...

323
00:43:20,558 --> 00:43:22,560
the original ones?

324
00:43:32,153 --> 00:43:37,033
Name me, muse,
the immortal singer...

325
00:43:37,242 --> 00:43:41,913
who,
abandoned by his mortal audience...

326
00:43:42,122 --> 00:43:43,623
lost his voice.

327
00:43:43,832 --> 00:43:46,835
He who,
from angel of poetry that he was...

328
00:43:47,043 --> 00:43:52,632
became the organ grinder
ignored or mocked...

329
00:43:52,841 --> 00:43:57,137
outside,
on the threshold of no man's land.

330
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:27,834
20 Marks, 40 Marks, 80 Marks.
In a week I could have 500.

331
00:44:28,043 --> 00:44:30,253
Off to the south.

332
00:44:30,462 --> 00:44:34,049
What a crazy idea to stand here.
Too much traffic.

333
00:44:34,257 --> 00:44:37,218
Idiot,
three times he's been this way.

334
00:44:37,427 --> 00:44:40,180
I want to get out of here.

335
00:44:40,388 --> 00:44:45,352
If anyone recognises me, I'll be
thrown out of secondary school.

336
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:49,314
I need Klaus,
he'd take good care of me.

337
00:44:49,522 --> 00:44:54,611
He was so good, too good.
And now he's dead.

338
00:45:03,787 --> 00:45:07,457
Are there still borders?
More than ever.

339
00:45:07,665 --> 00:45:13,254
Each street has its own border line.

340
00:45:13,463 --> 00:45:16,966
Between each plot
there's a no man's land strip...

341
00:45:17,175 --> 00:45:20,929
hidden by a hedge or by a ditch.

342
00:45:21,137 --> 00:45:24,724
Who dares,
will fall on booby traps...

343
00:45:24,933 --> 00:45:27,852
or be hit by laser beams.

344
00:45:28,061 --> 00:45:32,774
The trout in the water
are really torpedoes.

345
00:45:32,982 --> 00:45:37,070
Every proprietor, or even tenant...

346
00:45:37,278 --> 00:45:40,031
sticks up his nameplate
like a coat of arms...

347
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,284
and studies the paper
like a world leader.

348
00:45:43,493 --> 00:45:48,415
The German people are divided into as
many states as there are individuals.

349
00:45:48,623 --> 00:45:52,252
And these small states are mobile.

350
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,629
Each one takes his own with him...

351
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:58,675
and demands a toll
when another wants to enter.

352
00:45:58,883 --> 00:46:05,557
In the form of a fly in amber
or a leather bottle.

353
00:46:05,765 --> 00:46:07,517
So much for the border.

354
00:46:07,726 --> 00:46:13,815
But one can only enter each state
with the right passwords.

355
00:46:33,668 --> 00:46:37,964
Today's German soul can only
be conquered and governed...

356
00:46:38,173 --> 00:46:42,677
by he who arrives at each small state
with the password.

357
00:46:42,886 --> 00:46:46,348
Fortunately,
no one is now able to do so.

358
00:46:46,556 --> 00:46:53,313
So everyone migrates and
raises his own flag all over the world.

359
00:46:53,521 --> 00:46:56,066
Even their children
shake their rattles...

360
00:46:56,274 --> 00:46:59,652
and trail their filth around
in circles.

361
00:51:19,704 --> 00:51:21,706
The medals reflect the best.

362
00:51:21,915 --> 00:51:24,918
They were elegant, those brothers.

363
00:51:25,126 --> 00:51:27,837
Could I have light?
- But no flame.

364
00:51:28,046 --> 00:51:30,340
You're welcome.
- Thank you.

365
00:51:32,342 --> 00:51:36,137
The only thing I shall miss
from the outside...

366
00:51:36,346 --> 00:51:40,600
from the realm of light,
will be sparrows.

367
00:51:40,809 --> 00:51:43,561
Money buys happiness.
How to live?

368
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:46,564
The Man in the Golden Helmet
is a swindle.

369
00:51:46,773 --> 00:51:51,194
You're not natives,
you're all refugees.

370
00:51:51,403 --> 00:51:53,905
You're wet from swimming.

371
00:51:54,114 --> 00:51:57,742
I've been sitting here
since this morning...

372
00:51:57,951 --> 00:51:59,828
I'm so cold and bored.

373
00:52:00,036 --> 00:52:04,249
Wind in the face,
the first snow in the air.

374
00:52:04,499 --> 00:52:06,584
Water in the gutter.

375
00:52:06,793 --> 00:52:09,879
The balcony
with the beautiful stranger.

376
00:52:10,088 --> 00:52:14,926
Real ones. They look like it.
They could be real ones.

377
00:52:15,135 --> 00:52:18,388
Some stole food from the dogs
in the camps.

378
00:52:18,596 --> 00:52:24,352
That would take the grin off your face.
Don't be too sure yet.

379
00:52:24,561 --> 00:52:28,857
The Frenchman.
I met him in the streets.

380
00:52:29,065 --> 00:52:33,820
" Berlin won't be there any more,"
Constant said.

381
00:52:34,029 --> 00:52:40,660
The house was half gone.
Some of it still stood. For how long?

382
00:52:40,869 --> 00:52:43,288
Yes, I can still see this woman...

383
00:52:43,496 --> 00:52:50,920
who was standing up there
in the ruins shaking the duvet.

384
00:52:51,129 --> 00:52:56,217
When was that?
May... June 1945.

385
00:53:19,908 --> 00:53:24,829
Is he good at what he's doing?
It seems so.

386
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:46,935
I'd like to see it.
Maybe he'll give it to me.

387
00:55:49,265 --> 00:55:52,102
Come, I'll show you something else.

388
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:33,119
When the child was a child
it choked on spinach, peas...

389
00:57:33,328 --> 00:57:36,748
rice pudding
and steamed cauliflower...

390
00:57:36,956 --> 00:57:41,628
and now eats all of that,
and not just because it has to.

391
00:57:41,836 --> 00:57:46,883
When the child was a child,
it woke up once in a strange bed...

392
00:57:47,092 --> 00:57:49,344
but now time and time again.

393
00:57:49,552 --> 00:57:55,141
Many people seemed beautiful then,
nowadays it's only the odd one.

394
00:57:55,350 --> 00:58:02,023
It had a precise picture of Paradise,
and now can only guess at it.

395
00:58:02,232 --> 00:58:08,029
It couldn't imagine nothingness,
and today shudders at the idea.

396
00:58:08,238 --> 00:58:12,951
When the child was a child,
it played with enthusiasm...

397
00:58:13,159 --> 00:58:20,500
and now it can only muster it
when it concerns its work.

398
01:01:19,179 --> 01:01:21,848
Do you recall our first visit here?

399
01:01:22,057 --> 01:01:25,685
History had not yet begun.

400
01:01:25,894 --> 01:01:30,023
We let mornings and evenings go by,
and waited.

401
01:01:30,231 --> 01:01:36,905
It took a long time for the river to find
its bed and the stagnant water to flow.

402
01:01:37,113 --> 01:01:43,161
Valley of the primeval river.
One day, I still remember...

403
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:47,957
the glacier melted
and the icebergs drifted to the north.

404
01:01:48,166 --> 01:01:53,505
A tree passed by, still green,
with an empty bird's nest.

405
01:01:53,672 --> 01:01:57,759
Only the fish had leapt
over a myriad of years.

406
01:01:57,967 --> 01:02:01,471
Then came the moment
when the bees drowned.

407
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:06,351
Some time later,
the two stags fought on the bank.

408
01:02:06,643 --> 01:02:12,774
Then the flies and the antlers,
like branches, flowing down the river.

409
01:02:12,982 --> 01:02:15,318
All that ever grew again was grass...

410
01:02:15,527 --> 01:02:20,073
growing over the bodies of wild cats,
wild boar and buffaloes.

411
01:02:20,281 --> 01:02:25,995
One morning, out of the savannah,
its forehead smeared with grass...

412
01:02:26,204 --> 01:02:30,458
appeared the biped,
our image, so long awaited.

413
01:02:30,667 --> 01:02:32,961
And its first word was a shout.

414
01:02:33,169 --> 01:02:40,093
Was it "ah" or "oh",
or was it merely a groan?

415
01:02:40,301 --> 01:02:45,432
We were at last able to laugh,
for the first time.

416
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:51,146
Through this man's shout and that
of his followers, we learnt to speak.

417
01:02:51,354 --> 01:02:53,565
A long story.

418
01:02:53,773 --> 01:02:55,900
Sun, lightning, thunder in the sky...

419
01:02:56,109 --> 01:02:59,738
and below on earth,
the firesides, the leaps...

420
01:02:59,946 --> 01:03:03,408
the round dances,
the signs, the writing.

421
01:03:05,535 --> 01:03:10,040
Then one broke through the cycle
and ran straight ahead.

422
01:03:10,248 --> 01:03:17,088
As long as he ran straight ahead,
swerving sometimes perhaps from joy...

423
01:03:17,297 --> 01:03:21,051
he seemed free,
and again we could laugh with him.

424
01:03:21,259 --> 01:03:26,973
But then, suddenly, he ran zigzag,
and stones flew.

425
01:03:29,976 --> 01:03:35,815
With his flight began
the history of wars. It is still going on.

426
01:03:36,024 --> 01:03:41,363
But the story of the grass, the sun,
the leaps and the shouts...

427
01:03:41,571 --> 01:03:44,074
is still going on, too.

428
01:03:50,205 --> 01:03:54,459
Do you know how one day
the road was built here...

429
01:03:54,668 --> 01:03:59,005
which the next day
saw the Napoleon retreat...

430
01:03:59,214 --> 01:04:03,426
and was paved later on?

431
01:04:03,635 --> 01:04:09,849
Today it is covered with grass
and sunk in like a Roman road...

432
01:04:10,058 --> 01:04:12,227
with the tank tracks.

433
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:18,900
But we weren't even spectators.
We've always been too few.

434
01:04:24,739 --> 01:04:31,162
You really want...
- To conquer a history for myself.

435
01:04:31,371 --> 01:04:34,582
What my timeless downward look
has taught me...

436
01:04:34,791 --> 01:04:38,378
I want to transmute,
to sustain a glance...

437
01:04:38,586 --> 01:04:42,924
a short shout, a sour smell.

438
01:04:44,009 --> 01:04:48,847
I've been outside long enough.
Absent long enough.

439
01:04:49,055 --> 01:04:53,560
Long enough out of the world.
Let me enter the history of the world.

440
01:04:53,768 --> 01:04:56,521
Or just hold an apple in my hand.

441
01:04:56,730 --> 01:05:02,068
Look, those feathers,
there on the water, already vanished.

442
01:05:02,277 --> 01:05:09,576
Look, the tyre marks on the asphalt,
and now the cigarette butt rolling.

443
01:05:09,784 --> 01:05:15,957
The primeval river has dried up,
and only today's raindrops still quiver.

444
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:19,836
Down with the world behind the world.

445
01:06:43,461 --> 01:06:46,631
Only the Roman roads
still lead somewhere...

446
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:50,719
only the oldest traces
lead anywhere.

447
01:06:50,927 --> 01:06:53,388
Where is the top of the pass here?

448
01:06:53,596 --> 01:06:59,728
Even the plains, even Berlin,
has its hidden passes.

449
01:06:59,936 --> 01:07:06,776
And it's only there that my country,
the country of the tale, begins.

450
01:07:06,985 --> 01:07:11,114
Why doesn't everyone see
from childhood on...

451
01:07:11,322 --> 01:07:15,744
the passes, doors and crevices...

452
01:07:15,952 --> 01:07:20,081
on the ground and above in the sky.

453
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:27,714
If everyone saw them, there would be
history without murder or war.

454
01:07:27,922 --> 01:07:32,302
This time I'm doing it.
Funny I'm so calm.

455
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:36,639
Why red socks with black shoes?
Stupid.

456
01:07:36,848 --> 01:07:40,518
Foggy, cold.
Put on a pullover, afraid to be cold.

457
01:07:40,727 --> 01:07:45,273
Very good jacket. A bargain.
Just the pocket's torn.

458
01:07:45,482 --> 01:07:47,192
She gave it to me.

459
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:52,739
Pebbles on the roof. Why?
So it doesn't fly away? Nonsense.

460
01:07:53,365 --> 01:07:55,283
Once I'd like to fly.

461
01:07:55,492 --> 01:08:00,163
The plane circles over Berlin,
one day it'll crash.

462
01:08:00,372 --> 01:08:04,709
It's cold. My hands were
always warm. A good sign.

463
01:08:04,918 --> 01:08:07,671
It crackles underfoot.
What time is it?

464
01:08:07,879 --> 01:08:13,426
The sun's setting. Logical, the west.
Now I know where the west is.

465
01:08:13,635 --> 01:08:16,888
I always took the U-Bahn to the east
to go home...

466
01:08:17,097 --> 01:08:19,557
bought 10 tickets, saved a Mark.

467
01:08:19,766 --> 01:08:22,894
The sun in my back,
on the left the star.

468
01:08:23,103 --> 01:08:26,815
That's good: sun and a star.
Her little feet.

469
01:08:27,023 --> 01:08:30,652
Hopping from one foot to the other.
She danced so sweetly.

470
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:32,237
We were all alone.

471
01:08:32,445 --> 01:08:36,157
Has she got my letter?
I don't want her to read it.

472
01:08:36,366 --> 01:08:40,662
Berlin means nothing to me...
Havel? Is that a lake?

473
01:08:40,870 --> 01:08:45,834
Over there Wedding, or what?
The East is everywhere really.

474
01:08:46,042 --> 01:08:50,171
Strange people, they're shouting.
I don't care.

475
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:56,052
All these thoughts.
I'd really rather not think any more.

476
01:08:56,261 --> 01:08:58,263
I'm going, why?

477
01:10:27,977 --> 01:10:34,776
Leave me alone, you swine.
- Mother. Mother.

478
01:11:08,018 --> 01:11:13,690
I'll never make it tonight.
No trapeze on full-moon nights.

479
01:11:13,898 --> 01:11:18,028
Not the last time, the very last time.

480
01:11:18,236 --> 01:11:20,905
I should wake up from this dream.

481
01:11:21,114 --> 01:11:25,827
The end of the circus. Fini.

482
01:11:26,036 --> 01:11:31,374
And once again I feel
as if night were falling inside of me.

483
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:35,837
Fear... Fear of death.

484
01:11:36,046 --> 01:11:39,632
Why not death?

485
01:11:39,841 --> 01:11:42,093
The essential at times...

486
01:11:42,302 --> 01:11:48,475
just being beautiful, and nothing more.

487
01:11:48,683 --> 01:11:54,230
To look at oneself in the mirror
is to see oneself think.

488
01:11:54,439 --> 01:11:57,484
So what do you think?

489
01:11:57,734 --> 01:12:03,281
I think I still have the right to be afraid,
but not to talk about it.

490
01:12:03,448 --> 01:12:08,411
You're not yet blind,
the heart is still beating.

491
01:12:08,661 --> 01:12:11,748
And now you're crying after all.

492
01:12:11,956 --> 01:12:16,503
You'd like to cry
like a very sad little girl.

493
01:12:16,711 --> 01:12:20,090
Do you know why you're crying?
For whom?

494
01:12:20,298 --> 01:12:24,552
Not for me.
I don't know for whom.

495
01:12:24,761 --> 01:12:29,724
I'd like to know. I know nothing.

496
01:12:29,933 --> 01:12:36,815
I'm a little bit afraid.
It's gone, gone away. It'll come back.

497
01:12:37,065 --> 01:12:38,900
It doesn't matter.

498
01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:21,553
Just to be able to say,
like right now, I'm happy.

499
01:19:21,761 --> 01:19:27,851
I have a story,
and I'll go on having one.

500
01:24:27,817 --> 01:24:31,613
There it is again,
this feeling of well-being...

501
01:24:31,863 --> 01:24:37,869
as if inside my body
a hand was softly tightening.

502
01:25:25,667 --> 01:25:33,299
When the child was a child,
it was the time of these questions:

503
01:25:33,508 --> 01:25:37,929
Why am I me, and why not you?

504
01:25:38,096 --> 01:25:42,809
Why am I here, and why not there?

505
01:25:43,017 --> 01:25:47,438
When did time begin,
and where does space end?

506
01:25:47,689 --> 01:25:53,736
Isn't life under the sun just a dream?

507
01:27:11,272 --> 01:27:14,233
Isn't that Columbo?
- Don't think so.

508
01:27:14,484 --> 01:27:19,447
Not with that moth-eaten coat.
- He wouldn't be out here.

509
01:30:01,818 --> 01:30:05,405
Well?
- I'm going to enter the river.

510
01:30:05,571 --> 01:30:09,701
An old human expression
that I only understand today.

511
01:30:09,909 --> 01:30:11,786
Now or never, moment of the ford.

512
01:30:11,995 --> 01:30:15,957
But there is no other bank,
there is only the river.

513
01:30:16,165 --> 01:30:19,294
Into the ford of time,
the ford of death.

514
01:30:19,502 --> 01:30:22,547
We're not yet born,
so let's descend.

515
01:30:22,714 --> 01:30:26,217
To look is not to look from on high,
but at eye-level.

516
01:30:26,384 --> 01:30:29,679
First, I'll take a bath.

517
01:30:29,887 --> 01:30:34,058
Then I'll be shaved
by a Turkish barber...

518
01:30:34,225 --> 01:30:37,895
who will also massage me
down to the fingertips.

519
01:30:38,104 --> 01:30:44,360
Then I'll buy a newspaper and read it
from the headlines to the horoscope.

520
01:30:44,611 --> 01:30:50,491
On the first day, I'll only be served.
For requests, ask the neighbour.

521
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:54,579
If someone stumbles over my legs,
he'll apologise.

522
01:30:54,787 --> 01:30:56,998
If pushed, I'll push back.

523
01:30:57,165 --> 01:31:00,293
The bartender will find me
an empty table.

524
01:31:00,501 --> 01:31:04,589
A car will stop,
and the mayor will give me a lift.

525
01:31:04,797 --> 01:31:07,592
I'll be familiar to everyone,
suspect to no one.

526
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:10,970
I won't say a word,
will understand every language.

527
01:31:11,220 --> 01:31:16,559
This will be my first day.
- But none of it will be true.

528
01:31:47,799 --> 01:31:53,721
I'll take her in my arms,
and she'll take me in her arms.

529
01:32:39,225 --> 01:32:41,936
I think he's drunk.
- Yes.

530
01:33:06,544 --> 01:33:07,921
Let's go.

531
01:33:38,826 --> 01:33:40,286
It's got a taste.

532
01:33:43,456 --> 01:33:46,292
Now I begin to understand.

533
01:33:53,341 --> 01:33:55,843
Is that red?
- Yes.

534
01:33:56,052 --> 01:33:58,179
Did you hurt yourself?

535
01:33:58,388 --> 01:34:00,848
Is today a good day?
- It's okay.

536
01:34:02,392 --> 01:34:05,395
And the pipes?
- They're yellow.

537
01:34:05,603 --> 01:34:08,648
Yellow. What about him?
- He's grey-blue.

538
01:34:08,856 --> 01:34:11,901
Grey-blue. This one?
- Purple.

539
01:34:12,110 --> 01:34:13,903
This one?
- Orange. Ochre.

540
01:34:14,112 --> 01:34:16,864
Ochre or orange?
- Ochre.

541
01:34:17,073 --> 01:34:20,368
Yellow, red... this one?
- It's green.

542
01:34:20,576 --> 01:34:24,872
And what's that over the eye?
- That's blue.

543
01:34:26,124 --> 01:34:27,500
Blue.

544
01:34:28,084 --> 01:34:31,212
Is it very cold?
- It'll soon be over.

545
01:34:31,421 --> 01:34:33,339
I'd love to have a coffee.

546
01:34:33,548 --> 01:34:37,385
Do you have money?
- Yes... no.

547
01:34:42,056 --> 01:34:44,892
I'm glad everything is fine today.

548
01:34:55,445 --> 01:34:56,821
Beautiful.

549
01:35:23,765 --> 01:35:26,643
Coffee.
- With milk and sugar?

550
01:35:26,851 --> 01:35:28,311
Black.

551
01:36:10,645 --> 01:36:18,903
When the child was a child, it lived
on apples and bread, that was enough.

552
01:36:19,112 --> 01:36:21,364
And it is still that way.

553
01:36:23,700 --> 01:36:31,708
When the child was a child, berries fell
only like berries into its hand.

554
01:36:31,874 --> 01:36:34,711
And they still do now.

555
01:36:36,754 --> 01:36:42,844
Fresh walnuts made its tongue raw,
and they still do now.

556
01:36:43,052 --> 01:36:49,809
Atop each mountain
it was longing for a higher mountain.

557
01:36:50,018 --> 01:36:56,232
And in each city
it was longing for a bigger city.

558
01:36:56,441 --> 01:36:59,944
And it still does.

559
01:37:03,364 --> 01:37:06,743
Reached in the treetop
for the cherries...

560
01:37:06,951 --> 01:37:11,331
as excitedly as it still does today.

561
01:37:13,875 --> 01:37:19,631
Was shy in front of strangers,
and it still is.

562
01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:29,140
Waited for the first snow,
and still waits that way.

563
01:37:36,022 --> 01:37:44,280
When the child was a child, it threw
a stick like a lance into a tree.

564
01:37:44,489 --> 01:37:48,493
And it's still quivering there today.

565
01:38:29,117 --> 01:38:34,080
How do I get to Akazienstrasse?
- Go up Potsdamer to Kleistpark.

566
01:38:34,289 --> 01:38:39,877
Right at Grunewald past Gleditsch,
no right turn at Goltzstrasse.

567
01:38:40,086 --> 01:38:42,463
Turn left, and there you are.

568
01:39:15,705 --> 01:39:20,710
This entrance is for the crew.
Extras, the other way, please.

569
01:39:29,719 --> 01:39:32,805
Extra.
- That's just what you look like.

570
01:39:33,014 --> 01:39:34,724
They all want autographs.

571
01:39:35,850 --> 01:39:37,226
Lousy cop.

572
01:42:19,771 --> 01:42:23,691
Come on, Marion. Don't worry.
It'll be alright.

573
01:42:23,900 --> 01:42:27,528
I'll send you a postcard
of the Eiffel Tower.

574
01:42:27,737 --> 01:42:32,575
See you next season.
Don't forget the Alekan Circus.

575
01:42:32,784 --> 01:42:37,497
Bye Archie, see you next year.
- Au revoir.

576
01:42:37,705 --> 01:42:39,165
A thousand kisses.

577
01:42:39,374 --> 01:42:44,587
I'll send you a parcel.
With some Camembert cheese?

578
01:43:45,231 --> 01:43:50,653
I couldn't say who I am.
I don't have the slightest idea.

579
01:43:50,862 --> 01:43:56,743
I am someone
with no roots, no story, no country...

580
01:43:56,951 --> 01:43:59,537
and I like it that way.

581
01:43:59,746 --> 01:44:06,419
I am here, I am free. I can imagine
anything. It's all possible.

582
01:44:06,627 --> 01:44:12,508
I only have to raise my eyes,
and once again I become the world.

583
01:44:12,717 --> 01:44:16,596
Now, in this very place...

584
01:44:16,804 --> 01:44:23,019
a feeling of happiness
that I could always have.

585
01:46:23,264 --> 01:46:26,184
What are you doing?
- I'm sitting.

586
01:46:26,392 --> 01:46:28,853
Are you sad?
- No.

587
01:46:29,062 --> 01:46:32,732
Are you sick?
- Yes.

588
01:46:32,940 --> 01:46:35,526
What's the matter?
- A need.

589
01:46:35,735 --> 01:46:38,321
Oh, that's it.

590
01:46:38,529 --> 01:46:42,325
A double knot is the only way
to make it hold.

591
01:46:46,746 --> 01:46:51,167
A need. A need of food perhaps.
- Or a need of drink.

592
01:46:54,045 --> 01:46:58,007
She isn't gone, Cassiel. I know it.

593
01:46:58,216 --> 01:47:00,551
I'll find her.

594
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:05,306
Something will happen,
something important, tonight.

595
01:47:08,184 --> 01:47:11,145
She'll teach me everything.

596
01:47:12,271 --> 01:47:16,985
There are other suns then the one
up in the sky, Cassiel.

597
01:47:17,193 --> 01:47:21,823
In the deep of the night,
spring will begin today.

598
01:47:22,031 --> 01:47:25,368
Other wings will grow
in place of the old ones.

599
01:47:25,576 --> 01:47:29,455
Wings that will at last astound me.

600
01:56:39,380 --> 01:56:42,550
It must finally become serious.

601
01:56:46,346 --> 01:56:51,434
I've often been alone,
but I've never lived alone.

602
01:56:55,521 --> 01:56:59,275
When I was with someone
I was often happy...

603
01:56:59,484 --> 01:57:02,862
but at the same time
it all seemed a coincidence.

604
01:57:03,071 --> 01:57:08,951
These people were my parents,
but it could have been others.

605
01:57:09,160 --> 01:57:12,538
Why was the brown-eyed one
my brother...

606
01:57:12,747 --> 01:57:17,585
and not the green-eyed boy
on the opposite platform?

607
01:57:19,128 --> 01:57:22,632
The taxi driver's daughter
was my friend...

608
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:30,056
but I might as well have put
my arm around a horse's neck.

609
01:57:30,264 --> 01:57:35,144
I was with a man, I was in love...

610
01:57:35,353 --> 01:57:38,439
and I might as well
have left him there...

611
01:57:38,648 --> 01:57:44,821
and gone off with the stranger
we met in the street.

612
01:57:48,324 --> 01:57:51,369
Look at me, or don't.

613
01:57:51,577 --> 01:57:54,664
Give me your hand, or don't.

614
01:57:56,165 --> 01:58:01,546
No, don't give me your hand,
and look away.

615
01:58:07,385 --> 01:58:10,346
I think tonight is the new moon.

616
01:58:11,889 --> 01:58:14,183
No night more peaceful.

617
01:58:17,603 --> 01:58:21,190
No bloodshed in all the city.

618
01:58:21,399 --> 01:58:24,110
I've never played with anyone
and yet...

619
01:58:24,319 --> 01:58:29,657
I never opened my eyes and thought:
Now it's serious.

620
01:58:32,869 --> 01:58:36,080
At last it's becoming serious.

621
01:58:39,292 --> 01:58:42,003
So I've grown older.

622
01:58:44,630 --> 01:58:48,009
Was I the only one
who wasn't serious?

623
01:58:49,427 --> 01:58:52,680
Is it our times that are not serious?

624
01:58:54,057 --> 01:58:59,687
I've never been lonely,
neither alone, nor with someone else.

625
01:58:59,896 --> 01:59:02,982
But I would have liked to be lonely.

626
01:59:03,191 --> 01:59:08,196
Loneliness means: I am whole at last.

627
01:59:08,404 --> 01:59:14,410
Now I can say it,
as tonight I'm lonely at last.

628
01:59:14,619 --> 01:59:18,665
I must put an end to coincidence.

629
01:59:22,669 --> 01:59:26,005
The new moon of decision.

630
01:59:26,214 --> 01:59:31,177
I don't know if there is a destiny,
but there is a decision.

631
01:59:31,386 --> 01:59:33,971
Decide.

632
01:59:34,180 --> 01:59:38,142
Now we are the times.

633
01:59:38,351 --> 01:59:44,649
Not only the whole town, the whole
world is taking part in our decision.

634
01:59:44,857 --> 01:59:50,780
Now we are more than the two of us.
We incarnate something.

635
01:59:50,989 --> 01:59:54,200
We are sitting
on the People's Square...

636
01:59:54,409 --> 02:00:00,289
and the whole place is full of people
whose dream is the same as ours.

637
02:00:00,498 --> 02:00:04,711
We are deciding everybody's game.

638
02:00:04,919 --> 02:00:12,385
I am ready.
Now it's your turn.

639
02:00:12,593 --> 02:00:15,763
You hold the game in your hand.

640
02:00:15,972 --> 02:00:19,434
Now or never.

641
02:00:24,230 --> 02:00:31,154
You need me.
You will need me.

642
02:00:31,362 --> 02:00:38,703
There is no greater story than ours,
that of man and woman.

643
02:00:38,911 --> 02:00:42,999
It will be a story of giants.

644
02:00:43,207 --> 02:00:48,254
Invisible, transposable.

645
02:00:48,463 --> 02:00:52,383
A story of new ancestors.

646
02:00:54,510 --> 02:00:57,638
Look, my eyes.

647
02:00:59,682 --> 02:01:04,145
They are the image of necessity...

648
02:01:04,354 --> 02:01:08,524
of the future of everyone in the place.

649
02:01:11,736 --> 02:01:16,741
Last night I dreamt of a stranger.

650
02:01:20,453 --> 02:01:22,747
Of my man.

651
02:01:22,955 --> 02:01:26,209
Only with him could I be lonely...

652
02:01:26,417 --> 02:01:28,544
open up to him...

653
02:01:28,753 --> 02:01:33,341
wholly open, wholly for him...

654
02:01:33,549 --> 02:01:37,303
welcome him wholly into me...

655
02:01:37,512 --> 02:01:45,603
surround him with the labyrinth
of shared happiness.

656
02:01:45,812 --> 02:01:49,023
I know...

657
02:01:49,232 --> 02:01:51,776
it's you.

658
02:02:19,220 --> 02:02:21,222
Something happened.

659
02:02:23,057 --> 02:02:29,772
It is still going on. It binds me.

660
02:02:29,981 --> 02:02:37,196
It was true at night, and it's true
in the day, even more so now.

661
02:02:37,405 --> 02:02:43,661
Who was who?
I was in her and she was around me.

662
02:02:45,580 --> 02:02:50,585
Who in the world can claim that he
was ever together with another being?

663
02:02:50,793 --> 02:02:53,921
I am together.

664
02:02:54,130 --> 02:03:01,304
No mortal child was begot,
only an immortal common image.

665
02:03:01,512 --> 02:03:05,558
I learned astonishment that night.

666
02:03:05,767 --> 02:03:11,022
She came to take me home,
and I found home.

667
02:03:14,692 --> 02:03:16,986
It happened once.

668
02:03:19,739 --> 02:03:23,993
Once, and therefore forever.

669
02:03:26,412 --> 02:03:31,376
The image that we created
will be with me when I die.

670
02:03:33,127 --> 02:03:36,339
I will have lived within it.

671
02:03:38,091 --> 02:03:45,139
The amazement about the two of us,
amazement about man and woman...

672
02:03:45,348 --> 02:03:48,184
has turned me into a human being.

673
02:03:52,855 --> 02:03:59,070
I know now...

674
02:03:59,278 --> 02:04:01,072
what...

675
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:07,870
no angel knows.

676
02:04:13,710 --> 02:04:19,048
Name the men, women and children
who will look for me...

677
02:04:19,215 --> 02:04:24,137
me, their storyteller,
their cantor, their spokesman...

678
02:04:24,345 --> 02:04:32,770
because they need me
more than anything in the world.

679
02:04:33,688 --> 02:04:37,567
We have embarked.
