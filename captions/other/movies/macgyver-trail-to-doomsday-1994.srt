1
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,732
It won't work, MacGyver.

2
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:51,398
You can't do it!

3
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:52,732
Why not?!

4
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:54,632
I've done it before!

5
00:00:54,633 --> 00:00:57,431
Not with 400 pounds.

6
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:00,399
It's no problem, I tell you!

7
00:01:02,499 --> 00:01:04,000
Look out, Paul!

8
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:09,232
MacGyver!

9
00:01:09,233 --> 00:01:12,099
Please... cut me loose.

10
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,266
Forget it!

11
00:01:14,267 --> 00:01:15,799
Damn you!

12
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,799
We're both going to die!

13
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,432
No one's gonna die!

14
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:23,466
No one's gonna die.

15
00:01:26,699 --> 00:01:27,966
No one's gonna die.

16
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:15,032
Afternoon. Name's MacGyver.

17
00:02:15,033 --> 00:02:16,966
Invitation, please.
Quiet.

18
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:19,883
But slowly.

19
00:02:22,066 --> 00:02:24,465
It's all right, uh...
I'm a guest.

20
00:02:24,466 --> 00:02:25,698
I just haven't had time to

21
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:27,100
unpack the invitation.

22
00:02:27,627 --> 00:02:29,865
Thank you, Mr. MacGyver.

23
00:02:29,866 --> 00:02:31,032
You may enter.

24
00:02:31,033 --> 00:02:32,200
Thank you very much.

25
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:34,966
Good dog.

26
00:03:26,466 --> 00:03:27,533
Exactly.

27
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,199
MacGyver.

28
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,199
There he is!

29
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,266
Hey!
Hey!

30
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:38,732
How's me old mate?

31
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:39,865
Happy birthday,
Paul.

32
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:41,298
Look at you.

33
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:42,698
This is fantastic.

34
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:44,298
I can't believe it's
been fifteen years.

35
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:46,199
Oh, come on,
don't remind me.

36
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,199
That's ridiculous.

37
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,398
All right, thanks
for coming.

38
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:49,431
It means a lot.

39
00:03:49,432 --> 00:03:50,899
You kidding me?
I wouldn't miss this.

40
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,632
You only turn forty
once in your life, I hear,

41
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:54,203
although in your case...
Yeah- I-

42
00:03:55,332 --> 00:03:56,632
No, thank you.

43
00:03:56,633 --> 00:03:57,665
So, uh, did you like the car

44
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,598
I had waiting for you?

45
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,832
Well, it's, uh...

46
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:01,865
red.

47
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,166
But, uh- Yes, it's
very nice. Thanks.

48
00:04:04,167 --> 00:04:05,932
Well, at least you didn't
roll it this time.

49
00:04:05,933 --> 00:04:07,465
It's early.

50
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:09,232
Oh, by the way...

51
00:04:09,233 --> 00:04:11,932
you still owe me
a new pair of ski poles.

52
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:13,965
Oh, much more
than that, my friend.

53
00:04:13,966 --> 00:04:15,166
Much more.

54
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:16,365
I, uh...

55
00:04:16,366 --> 00:04:18,032
I never told you how much
your letters meant

56
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:19,232
when I lost Elizabeth.

57
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:21,466
I'm sorry I couldn't have
been here for you.

58
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:23,932
We had some good times...

59
00:04:23,933 --> 00:04:25,331
didn't we, Mac?

60
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:26,800
Absolutely the best.

61
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,460
Everything all right with you?

62
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,498
Paul?

63
00:04:36,499 --> 00:04:37,765
We have to talk.

64
00:04:37,766 --> 00:04:38,816
Daddy...

65
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:42,266
Elise, Natalia.

66
00:04:42,267 --> 00:04:45,232
Now you can actually meet
this wonderful man.

67
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:47,132
MacGyver,
my daughter Elise,

68
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:48,965
a doctoral candidate at 19.

69
00:04:48,966 --> 00:04:51,065
And, uh, if you'll forgive
a little paternal bragging,

70
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:53,932
my most trusted
and gifted associate.

71
00:04:53,933 --> 00:04:55,132
Papa, please.

72
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:56,331
Very nice to meet you again.

73
00:04:56,332 --> 00:04:57,532
You, too.

74
00:04:57,533 --> 00:04:58,865
You look just like your mom.

75
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:00,365
Thank you.

76
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:03,999
MacGyver, Natalia Krimm,
a close friend of the family.

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,965
The man who carried me
up a mountain on his back.

78
00:05:05,966 --> 00:05:07,267
Nice to meet you.

79
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:09,266
Likewise.

80
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,632
MacGyver and I spent the '70s

81
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:13,598
brainstorming solutions
to save the world.

82
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,565
What a shame they didn't work.

83
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:16,616
We're still trying.

84
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:19,647
There's the man I want to see.

85
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:22,698
Frederick Moran, Paul's brother.

86
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:24,032
I'm honored, Mr. MacGyver.

87
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:25,083
Frederick.

88
00:05:25,084 --> 00:05:26,266
It's good to finally meet you.

89
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:27,598
Thanks for making
all this happen.

90
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:28,932
Oh. My great pleasure.

91
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:30,266
I wanted to meet you years ago,

92
00:05:30,267 --> 00:05:33,365
but I was far too busy working,
to afford this place.

93
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,365
Excuse us.

94
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:36,032
I must steal
our guest of honor.

95
00:05:36,033 --> 00:05:37,498
Of course.

96
00:05:37,499 --> 00:05:39,932
Your trip was
satisfactory, I hope.

97
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:41,298
Yeah, it was great.

98
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,365
Um...

99
00:05:42,366 --> 00:05:44,099
got a little bumpy
at your guard gate there.

100
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,166
Oh. My apologies.

101
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:47,266
Sadly, a necessity these days.

102
00:05:47,267 --> 00:05:49,899
There's already been
one attempt on my life.

103
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,166
Really?

104
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:53,132
Yes, two years ago,
in the heart of the city.

105
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:55,999
It seems that nowadays anyone
with money is a target.

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,732
Particularly
a wealthy industrialist.

107
00:05:58,733 --> 00:05:59,783
Excuse me.

108
00:06:01,317 --> 00:06:05,832
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention please.

109
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,398
Would you all come
a little closer?

110
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:10,266
Yes, that's right, thank you.
Please, come in.

111
00:06:10,267 --> 00:06:11,532
I would like to introduce you to

112
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:14,266
a very special friend
of this family.

113
00:06:14,267 --> 00:06:15,999
In fact, there would be
no celebration

114
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,498
of my brother's birthday today...

115
00:06:18,499 --> 00:06:21,232
had it not been
for this man's heroism.

116
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:23,099
So please, I'd like you all
to raise your glasses

117
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,332
for a very special toast.

118
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,533
Get down. Get down.

119
00:06:59,431 --> 00:07:02,331
It's nothing.
It's my shoulder.

120
00:07:02,332 --> 00:07:03,532
Help the others.

121
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:06,532
Frederick.
It's Paul.

122
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:07,599
They've shot
Paul.

123
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,100
Call the paramedics.

124
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:17,932
No.

125
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:19,033
Paul. Paul.

126
00:07:25,766 --> 00:07:26,816
Sample...

127
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:30,533
pack.

128
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,965
What?

129
00:07:32,966 --> 00:07:34,298
What?

130
00:07:34,299 --> 00:07:35,498
Paul.

131
00:07:35,499 --> 00:07:38,232
Paul, come on.

132
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:39,865
Come on.

133
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:40,916
Paul.

134
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,865
Sir. They've taken your niece.

135
00:07:47,866 --> 00:07:49,006
They've kidnapped her.

136
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,950
Elise.

137
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,366
I'm Tony Graves, family friend.

138
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:17,932
Where's Mr. Moran?

139
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:18,932
He's in the study, sir.

140
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:19,983
Thanks.

141
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,398
I'm not interested in statements.

142
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,932
I want action.
Do you understand?

143
00:08:24,933 --> 00:08:27,465
Look. Try to get hold of
yourself, Mr. Moran.

144
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:29,465
Frederick!

145
00:08:29,466 --> 00:08:31,699
Frederick, I... I'm so sorry.

146
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,166
If there's anything I can do.

147
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:35,166
Thank you, Tony.

148
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:36,965
You can step aside, Mr. Graves,

149
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:38,932
and allow the police
to do their work.

150
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:40,099
Oh, sorry, captain,

151
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,532
I forgot how, uh,
easily you get confused.

152
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:44,498
Don't get smart with me, Graves.

153
00:08:44,499 --> 00:08:46,132
I can make life
very difficult for you.

154
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:47,398
Oh, really?

155
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,565
Chief superintendent, this is
my home. Remember that.

156
00:08:49,566 --> 00:08:51,598
And this is my investigation,
Mr. Moran.

157
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:53,232
We must all understand that.

158
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:54,398
Excuse me, sir.

159
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,449
Yes, what is it?

160
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:02,349
Thank you.

161
00:09:04,466 --> 00:09:06,266
They found a body by the river.

162
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:07,499
It could be the girl's.

163
00:09:22,966 --> 00:09:24,286
Can you wait here, please?

164
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,890
Mr. Moran, the face,
it's been battered.

165
00:09:32,332 --> 00:09:35,765
Elise...

166
00:09:35,766 --> 00:09:36,816
Oh, no.

167
00:09:54,566 --> 00:09:56,733
From one generation to another.

168
00:11:54,866 --> 00:11:58,465
This was to have been
the happiest week of my life.

169
00:11:58,466 --> 00:12:00,765
Expectations of joy.

170
00:12:00,766 --> 00:12:02,599
Renewed friendships.

171
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:07,100
And now, my brother is gone.

172
00:12:08,466 --> 00:12:09,516
My whole family.

173
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,150
It's very hard.

174
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:16,109
They will always
live in our hearts.

175
00:12:18,233 --> 00:12:20,499
It's a sad day for
all of us, Frederick.

176
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,032
MacGyver...

177
00:12:24,033 --> 00:12:25,632
forgive me for ignoring you.

178
00:12:25,633 --> 00:12:26,932
You came from so far...

179
00:12:26,933 --> 00:12:29,065
No, don't even think about it.

180
00:12:29,066 --> 00:12:30,799
Rest as long as you like.

181
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,099
My secretary will gladly handle

182
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,166
your return arrangements.

183
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:35,037
That won't be necessary,
Frederick.

184
00:12:36,866 --> 00:12:38,799
I insist.
You're my guest.

185
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,565
Well...

186
00:12:40,566 --> 00:12:41,965
I've changed my plans.

187
00:12:41,966 --> 00:12:44,065
I'm not leaving.

188
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:45,598
Paul was too good a friend.

189
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:46,965
Not leaving?

190
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,132
MacGyver, please.

191
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:50,865
Let the police handle this.

192
00:12:50,866 --> 00:12:52,832
Well, the police can have
their investigation,

193
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,099
I'll have mine.

194
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,832
Besides, I'm a new face in town.

195
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,783
Working alone, maybe I can do
some things the police can't.

196
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:04,266
You are indeed the man
Paul said you were.

197
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:05,466
Bless you, MacGyver.

198
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:09,666
My resources are
at your disposal.

199
00:13:09,671 --> 00:13:12,598
I will support you
in any way I can.

200
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:13,899
Thank you.
Perhaps...

201
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,166
Tony can be of help too.

202
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:18,132
As a liaison.

203
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:19,698
Troubleshooter.

204
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:21,319
His background is Intelligence.

205
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,698
I'd be...

206
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:25,465
proud to help.

207
00:13:25,466 --> 00:13:26,516
Good.

208
00:13:27,733 --> 00:13:29,298
Good.

209
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:31,032
And, if we could persuade

210
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:31,999
our uniquely qualified-

211
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,050
No.

212
00:13:33,766 --> 00:13:34,932
Frederick, please...

213
00:13:34,933 --> 00:13:36,032
But Natalia...

214
00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:37,532
I said no.

215
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:39,699
I'm sorry, MacGyver.

216
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:43,498
Look, it's getting late.

217
00:13:43,499 --> 00:13:44,599
I could use a lift home.

218
00:14:08,966 --> 00:14:10,046
Thank you for the lift.

219
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,732
I'm sorry if I offended you

220
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:16,932
with my reaction to Frederick.

221
00:14:16,933 --> 00:14:18,683
Oh, it's kind of tough
to offend me.

222
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:22,832
Mind if I ask why
you did react like that?

223
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,800
I do mind, as a matter of fact.

224
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:27,765
Thank you for escorting me.

225
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:30,398
I think I'm quite capable
of letting myself in.

226
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,449
I bet.

227
00:14:34,066 --> 00:14:35,116
Wait.

228
00:14:57,533 --> 00:14:58,583
Hey!

229
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,150
Damn them.

230
00:15:34,966 --> 00:15:36,065
Damn them!

231
00:15:36,066 --> 00:15:37,398
Any ideas?

232
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:38,449
Of course.

233
00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:40,966
Terrorists, who else?

234
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,732
Why would they hit you?

235
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:46,632
I've been seen with Frederick.

236
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:48,965
Photographed. You know the press.

237
00:15:48,966 --> 00:15:50,665
Always linking people together.

238
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,065
They love rumors.

239
00:15:52,066 --> 00:15:53,498
With all due respect,

240
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:55,465
this looks like
more than just rumors.

241
00:15:55,466 --> 00:15:57,065
Fortunately, I'm not dependent on

242
00:15:57,066 --> 00:15:58,206
material possessions.

243
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,050
Whoop.

244
00:16:21,966 --> 00:16:23,016
Well...

245
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:27,533
Looks like they forgot one of
your material possessions.

246
00:16:28,866 --> 00:16:29,916
Please give it to me.

247
00:16:35,366 --> 00:16:36,633
All right, look.

248
00:16:38,566 --> 00:16:41,298
You move like a cat,
you handle a gun like a pro,

249
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:44,166
and you've got a poison
cartridge pen in your purse.

250
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:45,832
Is there anything
you want to tell me

251
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,298
about your...unique
qualifications?

252
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:49,565
There's nothing to tell.

253
00:16:49,566 --> 00:16:50,932
Yeah, right.

254
00:16:50,933 --> 00:16:53,765
I've run across a couple of
these things in my time.

255
00:16:53,766 --> 00:16:56,599
And every one of them
belonged to a KGB agent.

256
00:17:00,432 --> 00:17:01,482
Come on, Miss Krimm.

257
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,449
All right.

258
00:17:08,633 --> 00:17:11,398
I was studying
languages in Moscow.

259
00:17:11,399 --> 00:17:14,032
I was approached and
offered a job with the KGB.

260
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,132
Most of my time
working for them

261
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:17,132
was spent in London.

262
00:17:17,133 --> 00:17:19,632
But it's over now.
Past.

263
00:17:19,633 --> 00:17:22,799
I broke all ties
years ago.

264
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,850
So what do you do now?

265
00:17:25,267 --> 00:17:28,298
Little work for Frederick.

266
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:29,933
Mostly I keep to myself.

267
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,200
Let me ask you something.

268
00:17:44,637 --> 00:17:48,431
You still have contacts
in this town?

269
00:17:48,432 --> 00:17:50,832
I told you, I broke
all ties years ago.

270
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,513
But you still know people, right?

271
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,331
Please...

272
00:17:54,332 --> 00:17:55,598
leave me out of it.

273
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:57,632
I don't want to
renew those connections.

274
00:17:57,633 --> 00:18:00,832
Hey. I'm not too familiar with
the terrorist scene around here.

275
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,331
I could use some help
getting in, okay?

276
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:03,532
I said no.

277
00:18:03,533 --> 00:18:05,499
It's not my business.
I keep to myself.

278
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:12,732
Look...

279
00:18:12,733 --> 00:18:15,266
the Morans have been a very
important part of my life,

280
00:18:15,267 --> 00:18:17,431
and they have just
been crucified.

281
00:18:17,432 --> 00:18:19,199
I was told you were
a good friend of the family.

282
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,632
Well, you've got a chance
to prove it right now.

283
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,331
I could use your help.

284
00:18:23,332 --> 00:18:24,466
So could they.

285
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,150
Really.

286
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,250
Wow.

287
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:40,866
Yeah. Sleep well.

288
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,250
MacGyver.

289
00:18:47,499 --> 00:18:48,833
Tell me what you need.

290
00:19:08,033 --> 00:19:10,266
This is an honor, comrade.

291
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:11,498
To be on the same level

292
00:19:11,499 --> 00:19:13,065
with someone of your rank.

293
00:19:13,066 --> 00:19:14,565
Stop it, Nikolai.

294
00:19:14,566 --> 00:19:15,999
This is the man I-

295
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,200
Did you bring the money?

296
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,267
Your turn.

297
00:19:28,966 --> 00:19:30,632
This group is very dangerous.

298
00:19:30,633 --> 00:19:32,665
They have no political agenda.

299
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,899
They're antiestablishment
anarchists.

300
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,565
They'll work for anyone.

301
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:39,365
Qaddafi, the I.R.A., you name it.

302
00:19:39,366 --> 00:19:40,446
They're very violent.

303
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,166
Can I get in?

304
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:46,565
I can make contact
with their leader today.

305
00:19:46,566 --> 00:19:48,665
His name is Joseph.

306
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,665
I'll take care of
the details. He trusts me.

307
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:52,716
But I warn you.

308
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,398
If they suspect you...

309
00:19:55,399 --> 00:19:56,449
they will kill you.

310
00:19:58,267 --> 00:19:59,317
Set it up.

311
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:37,716
Gentlemen.

312
00:20:39,499 --> 00:20:40,966
Which one's Joseph?

313
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,832
Joseph's watching.

314
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:46,399
First you got to prove
yourself against our best.

315
00:20:50,566 --> 00:20:51,616
Ow.

316
00:21:46,533 --> 00:21:47,666
Very impressive.

317
00:21:49,366 --> 00:21:51,133
Now finish him off.

318
00:21:54,566 --> 00:21:55,616
Go on.

319
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,533
You've earned it.

320
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,865
It's a stupid leader who
sacrifices his own men.

321
00:22:34,866 --> 00:22:37,331
I was looking for professionals,

322
00:22:37,332 --> 00:22:39,100
not a bunch of suicidal punks.

323
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,416
All right.

324
00:22:49,699 --> 00:22:52,799
You've earned yourself
a private meeting.

325
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,266
You come with good references,

326
00:22:54,267 --> 00:22:55,767
and Nikolai says you're solid.

327
00:22:57,366 --> 00:22:59,056
We'll let you know
when and where.

328
00:23:01,399 --> 00:23:02,449
Swell.

329
00:23:11,966 --> 00:23:13,016
Yeah.

330
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,331
Nice bridge.

331
00:23:31,332 --> 00:23:32,532
Yeah. Well, things are risky

332
00:23:32,533 --> 00:23:33,698
at the moment, all right?

333
00:23:33,699 --> 00:23:35,698
Oh, feeling a little heat,
are you? Police?

334
00:23:35,699 --> 00:23:36,732
No.
Who?

335
00:23:36,733 --> 00:23:38,132
Big money.

336
00:23:38,133 --> 00:23:40,465
The Moran job was for hire,
but something's turned.

337
00:23:40,466 --> 00:23:41,866
That's why you're here.

338
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:45,099
Three of our strike team
have disappeared.

339
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,799
The other's afraid
to surface.

340
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,999
He hasn't shown
at our regular meeting spot.

341
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,799
Yeah, where's that?

342
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,065
Just listen.

343
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:54,065
I'll give you the information
you need.

344
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:56,232
The money knows
where we meet.

345
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:57,832
It's become very dangerous.

346
00:23:57,833 --> 00:23:59,498
All right, so it's dangerous.

347
00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:01,000
Where's this meeting place?

348
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:04,032
In the sewers.

349
00:24:04,033 --> 00:24:05,598
We meet at the fourth quadrant.

350
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:07,465
Fourth quadrant. All right.

351
00:24:07,466 --> 00:24:09,999
Our stray's coming to my place
tonight at 11:30.

352
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,331
Be there.

353
00:24:11,332 --> 00:24:13,982
You'll get instructions
for your first assignment.

354
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:18,199
Wanna give me some hint
as to what that might be?

355
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,598
Our ace in the hole
stashed at the meeting spot.

356
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:23,232
The suit's own handwritten
request for the hit.

357
00:24:23,233 --> 00:24:25,732
And photos he gave me
of the target.

358
00:24:25,733 --> 00:24:28,765
You're gonna retrieve them
for us, tough guy.

359
00:24:28,766 --> 00:24:31,066
Eleven-thirty,
all right? Be there.

360
00:24:33,564 --> 00:24:37,865
Well, you can't go in
without it, MacGyver.

361
00:24:37,866 --> 00:24:39,865
If you don't wear a wire,
we'll have no way of knowing

362
00:24:39,866 --> 00:24:41,398
if anything goes wrong.

363
00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:43,232
I don't like wires.

364
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:44,732
If something does go wrong,

365
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:45,999
they're impossible to explain.

366
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,732
Well, I'm telling you,
it's foolhardy.

367
00:24:47,733 --> 00:24:49,765
You'll be walking in naked.

368
00:24:49,766 --> 00:24:51,732
Look, just listen to me
on this, okay?

369
00:24:51,733 --> 00:24:53,465
I'm experienced
in these matters.

370
00:24:53,466 --> 00:24:54,733
So am I.

371
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,865
Damn it, man-

372
00:24:56,866 --> 00:24:57,916
What?

373
00:24:58,966 --> 00:25:01,365
It was my, uh-

374
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:02,416
It was-

375
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:05,099
It was my understanding

376
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,132
that you were...open
to assistance.

377
00:25:07,133 --> 00:25:08,932
Yeah. Assistance, yes.

378
00:25:08,933 --> 00:25:10,698
Orders, no.

379
00:25:10,699 --> 00:25:12,233
I'm not giving orders.
Tony...

380
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:16,632
why don't you go
and wait in the car?

381
00:25:16,633 --> 00:25:18,832
Please?

382
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:20,666
I'll be down in a minute.

383
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,267
Okay.

384
00:25:30,066 --> 00:25:31,498
I'm sorry.

385
00:25:31,499 --> 00:25:33,398
Sometimes Tony can be
a little overbearing.

386
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:35,266
He's used to being in charge.

387
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:36,866
Yeah, so am I.

388
00:25:38,066 --> 00:25:39,200
He means well.

389
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:42,699
And you are very stubborn.

390
00:25:44,432 --> 00:25:45,498
Really?

391
00:25:45,499 --> 00:25:47,466
It's part of your charm.

392
00:25:50,267 --> 00:25:51,932
How can I help?

393
00:25:51,933 --> 00:25:54,298
Okay. We know somebody
other than Joseph

394
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:55,498
was behind all this,

395
00:25:55,499 --> 00:25:57,099
so you can start by making
a list of people

396
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,765
who might have wanted
Frederick dead.

397
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:00,576
You mean-?
Anybody you can think of.

398
00:26:01,499 --> 00:26:03,233
Including his friends.

399
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:42,516
Ugh!

400
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,766
Paul.

401
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,398
What's going on here?

402
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:54,833
It's all right.

403
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:58,332
You're all right now.

404
00:35:04,533 --> 00:35:06,099
Oh.

405
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,866
Why am I naked?

406
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:12,166
Nikolai found you in Soho
and called me.

407
00:35:12,167 --> 00:35:13,733
You've been very sick.

408
00:35:16,332 --> 00:35:19,698
Why are we in bed together?

409
00:35:19,699 --> 00:35:21,698
You were burning up
with fever, then chills.

410
00:35:21,699 --> 00:35:24,832
I- I couldn't think
of what else to do.

411
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:26,365
Oh.

412
00:35:26,366 --> 00:35:29,865
I saw this once in
an American movie.

413
00:35:29,866 --> 00:35:33,332
We watched many of those
during KGB training.

414
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:35,332
Um...

415
00:35:37,332 --> 00:35:39,833
Mind if I ask what
happened here, exactly?

416
00:35:41,566 --> 00:35:43,006
The details are unimportant.

417
00:35:44,766 --> 00:35:47,332
Let's just say your fever broke.

418
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:51,132
My fever?

419
00:35:51,133 --> 00:35:53,199
We've lost a lot of time.

420
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,366
We should get to work.

421
00:35:55,699 --> 00:35:57,899
What do you mean, "we"?

422
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,599
I'm just here to help.

423
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:03,933
Your clothes, sir.

424
00:36:11,466 --> 00:36:13,900
Why did the terrorists
want to kill you?

425
00:36:15,366 --> 00:36:16,416
They didn't.

426
00:36:17,866 --> 00:36:20,199
I think it was the people
who hired them.

427
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,399
What?

428
00:36:22,766 --> 00:36:23,816
Yeah.

429
00:36:24,633 --> 00:36:26,432
My contact was hit.

430
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,999
The Moran attack
wasn't terrorist,

431
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,620
and it wasn't aimed at Frederick.

432
00:36:32,766 --> 00:36:33,833
Who, then?

433
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,833
Paul.

434
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:40,699
Are you sure?

435
00:36:43,233 --> 00:36:44,799
I think so.

436
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,199
There were some pictures of Paul

437
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,365
and a...

438
00:36:48,366 --> 00:36:50,999
handwritten note from
whoever ordered the hit.

439
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,232
I was supposed to get 'em, but...

440
00:36:53,233 --> 00:36:55,665
Do you know who?
Did you read the note?

441
00:36:55,666 --> 00:36:57,865
No.

442
00:36:57,866 --> 00:37:00,331
There wasn't time.

443
00:37:00,332 --> 00:37:02,832
All I know is somebody
had Paul killed,

444
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:06,032
and that same somebody
wants me out of the way.

445
00:37:06,033 --> 00:37:09,267
Who'd want to hurt dear Paul?

446
00:37:10,966 --> 00:37:12,016
I don't know.

447
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:18,099
But something was bugging him
the day of the party.

448
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,200
He started to tell me, but...

449
00:37:22,933 --> 00:37:25,163
Maybe it's got
something to do with his work.

450
00:37:28,833 --> 00:37:31,498
I need to get into his lab.

451
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,466
Tony Graves can arrange that.

452
00:37:34,366 --> 00:37:35,899
How?

453
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,800
His company funded Paul's work.

454
00:37:58,432 --> 00:37:59,665
What's going on?

455
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:01,498
There's been a break-in
at Paul's lab.

456
00:38:01,499 --> 00:38:02,999
A break-in?
Yeah, about an hour ago.

457
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,099
What were they after?

458
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,150
I don't know.

459
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,100
Thank you.

460
00:38:13,733 --> 00:38:15,565
Dr. Massey?

461
00:38:15,566 --> 00:38:17,166
This is Mr. MacGyver.

462
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:18,765
Dr. Massey, good to meet you.

463
00:38:18,766 --> 00:38:20,598
Oh, of course, forgive me.
Paul's friend.

464
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:22,431
Oh, and, uh,
this is Natalia Krimm.

465
00:38:22,432 --> 00:38:23,965
She's a close friend
of the Morans.

466
00:38:23,966 --> 00:38:24,999
How do you do?

467
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,199
Well, doctor, it looks like-

468
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,066
Excuse me, doctor.
I'm sorry.

469
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,420
Is this what Paul was working on?

470
00:38:36,033 --> 00:38:40,132
Paul was fine-tuning a portable
mass spectrometer he designed.

471
00:38:40,133 --> 00:38:41,732
But not just any.

472
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:44,232
The most highly sensitive
ever developed.

473
00:38:44,233 --> 00:38:45,765
For the START signatories.

474
00:38:45,766 --> 00:38:48,465
Capable of measuring
the slightest nuclear presence.

475
00:38:48,466 --> 00:38:50,598
Huh. Big stuff, huh?

476
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:52,099
It's such a tragedy.

477
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,565
The death of my brilliant
colleague,

478
00:38:53,566 --> 00:38:55,099
and now the desecration
of his work.

479
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,765
Did you notice anything missing?

480
00:38:56,766 --> 00:38:57,765
Oh, everything.

481
00:38:57,766 --> 00:38:59,498
His records, files,
all his samples.

482
00:38:59,499 --> 00:39:00,632
Work in progress.

483
00:39:00,633 --> 00:39:02,832
What samples?
Of what?

484
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:04,365
Well, Paul had just completed

485
00:39:04,366 --> 00:39:05,532
the first air sample test

486
00:39:05,533 --> 00:39:07,598
for the new machine,
from all over England.

487
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:08,598
Now everything's gone:

488
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:09,999
the samples,
records, results,

489
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,050
everything.

490
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:13,799
Graves.

491
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,065
I'm getting tired of finding you

492
00:39:15,066 --> 00:39:16,398
at my crime scenes.

493
00:39:16,399 --> 00:39:18,632
You have no business
here. Now, get out.

494
00:39:18,633 --> 00:39:20,065
And that goes
for the rest of you-

495
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:22,298
Hey- Excuse me,
chief superintendent,

496
00:39:22,299 --> 00:39:23,498
but, um...

497
00:39:23,499 --> 00:39:25,365
it was my company
that financed this lab.

498
00:39:25,366 --> 00:39:27,132
I don't give a damn
what you financed

499
00:39:27,133 --> 00:39:28,331
with your filthy money.

500
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:30,331
Watch it, Capshaw.

501
00:39:30,332 --> 00:39:31,865
Don't threaten me, Graves.

502
00:39:31,866 --> 00:39:33,932
I forgot what a tough guy
you were.

503
00:39:33,933 --> 00:39:36,298
What was it?
Eleven counts

504
00:39:36,299 --> 00:39:38,465
of excessive force, one death.

505
00:39:38,466 --> 00:39:39,632
Oh, you don't frighten me,

506
00:39:39,633 --> 00:39:41,132
you pompous little ass!

507
00:39:41,133 --> 00:39:43,065
Hey, hey!
Come on, gentlemen.

508
00:39:43,066 --> 00:39:44,232
Please.

509
00:39:44,233 --> 00:39:47,900
I want this lab clearednow.

510
00:40:01,017 --> 00:40:03,065
Dr. Massey?

511
00:40:03,066 --> 00:40:04,299
Hm?

512
00:40:07,033 --> 00:40:09,565
Paul mentioned the word
"samples" to me

513
00:40:09,566 --> 00:40:10,999
just before he died.

514
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,032
Do you know anything
about his findings?

515
00:40:13,033 --> 00:40:15,232
Whatsamples he might
have been referring to?

516
00:40:15,233 --> 00:40:16,632
No, that's my frustration.

517
00:40:16,633 --> 00:40:18,232
Paul never spoke to anyone

518
00:40:18,233 --> 00:40:19,598
about his work, except Elise,

519
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:20,765
God rest her soul.

520
00:40:20,766 --> 00:40:23,799
Oh, she was his confidant.
Brilliant mind.

521
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,865
Of course, the man
lived for his research.

522
00:40:25,866 --> 00:40:27,965
I mean, he slept here.
This was his second home.

523
00:40:27,966 --> 00:40:29,999
Wait a minute.
Paul slept here?

524
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,365
Yes. Yeah, well, yes, at times.

525
00:40:32,366 --> 00:40:33,866
He kept a little room upstairs.

526
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,440
Right. Clear the room, please.

527
00:41:49,477 --> 00:41:52,999
It seems you don't
understand English.

528
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,466
Leave the room immediately.

529
00:42:02,966 --> 00:42:04,331
MacGyver...

530
00:42:04,332 --> 00:42:06,199
you're getting dangerously close

531
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,832
to interfering in my territory.

532
00:42:07,833 --> 00:42:10,432
Now please, stay out
of my investigation.

533
00:42:32,933 --> 00:42:34,498
Two minutes.

534
00:42:34,499 --> 00:42:36,365
I just needed two
more minutes in that room.

535
00:42:36,366 --> 00:42:37,416
Why?

536
00:42:40,633 --> 00:42:42,132
I'm gonna take you home.

537
00:42:42,133 --> 00:42:43,632
I'll contact you later.

538
00:42:43,633 --> 00:42:45,199
What is this?

539
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,965
Have I outlived my usefulness?

540
00:42:46,966 --> 00:42:49,032
Just try to understand, will you?

541
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:50,083
What?

542
00:42:51,167 --> 00:42:53,398
Ten minutes ago we were
working as a team.

543
00:42:53,399 --> 00:42:54,965
Now, suddenly, you don't trust me.

544
00:42:54,966 --> 00:42:56,665
Look, this is nothing personal,

545
00:42:56,666 --> 00:42:59,016
but right now, I can't
afford to trust anybody.

546
00:43:00,233 --> 00:43:01,965
Damn you!

547
00:43:01,966 --> 00:43:03,799
Who just saved your life?

548
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,832
Who nursed you back to health?

549
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,065
Natalia, believe me...

550
00:43:08,066 --> 00:43:09,331
you've helped a lot.

551
00:43:09,332 --> 00:43:11,365
And I appreciate
everything you've done.

552
00:43:11,366 --> 00:43:13,598
You need me, MacGyver.

553
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,032
Oh, I do, do I?

554
00:43:15,033 --> 00:43:17,565
I'm a better spy than you are...

555
00:43:17,566 --> 00:43:20,000
in matters requiring deceit.

556
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,932
Capshaw's always hated Tony.

557
00:43:37,933 --> 00:43:39,665
He hides that well.

558
00:43:39,666 --> 00:43:41,732
Years ago, Tony worked
for a brief time

559
00:43:41,733 --> 00:43:43,398
with British Intelligence.

560
00:43:43,399 --> 00:43:44,965
He was in American Intelligence

561
00:43:44,966 --> 00:43:46,331
stationed in the U.K.

562
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:48,365
It all ended very badly
for him, though,

563
00:43:48,366 --> 00:43:51,066
when a terrorist suspect
died during questioning.

564
00:43:52,133 --> 00:43:53,698
Graves killed somebody?

565
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:55,799
That was never really determined.

566
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,099
But Capshaw had the misfortune
of being present

567
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,199
as a young officer.

568
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,331
He's hated Tony
for it ever since.

569
00:44:01,332 --> 00:44:04,166
Apparently, he feels
his reputation and career

570
00:44:04,167 --> 00:44:05,533
were permanently smeared.

571
00:44:19,399 --> 00:44:21,431
Mr. MacGyver.
Yeah?

572
00:44:21,432 --> 00:44:22,482
Your results.

573
00:44:23,733 --> 00:44:25,533
Thanks.

574
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,431
I don't believe it.

575
00:44:33,432 --> 00:44:34,482
W- What is it?

576
00:44:35,866 --> 00:44:38,799
The air sample shows
high level of uranium isotope.

577
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,766
U-235.
So?

578
00:44:42,267 --> 00:44:44,317
It's what they use to make
nuclear bombs.

579
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:46,999
Uncontrolled nuclear material

580
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,398
is being processed
somewhere nearby.

581
00:44:49,399 --> 00:44:51,932
In England?
But that can't be.

582
00:44:51,933 --> 00:44:53,498
Oh, well, this says it can.

583
00:44:53,499 --> 00:44:55,598
Somebody's operating
a nuclear facility,

584
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:56,999
and Paul found it.

585
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,099
Why?

586
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,499
The cold war is over.

587
00:45:00,499 --> 00:45:01,633
I don't know.

588
00:45:04,699 --> 00:45:07,332
Maybe it's just about...

589
00:45:08,966 --> 00:45:10,498
money.

590
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:11,833
Money?

591
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,033
Maybe.
Think about it.

592
00:45:16,267 --> 00:45:17,698
Terrorist groups.

593
00:45:17,699 --> 00:45:20,199
Rogue nations like Iraq,
Iran, Libya,

594
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,232
they'd pay anything
for nuclear capability.

595
00:45:22,233 --> 00:45:23,999
And if there is somebody
who can supply 'em,

596
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,765
I don't even want to
think of the implications.

597
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:29,532
I gotta find out where
the sample came from.

598
00:45:29,533 --> 00:45:31,298
MacGyver.
No.

599
00:45:31,299 --> 00:45:33,665
Listen to me. We're
both under surveillance.

600
00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:35,932
We can't go back
to your place or mine.

601
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:37,398
You're a target.

602
00:45:37,399 --> 00:45:40,498
We need a safe house
we can use as a base.

603
00:45:40,499 --> 00:45:41,966
I'll find us one.

604
00:45:46,766 --> 00:45:48,599
All right.

605
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,866
C-A-R...

606
00:47:01,366 --> 00:47:02,932
C.

607
00:47:02,933 --> 00:47:03,983
It's a C.

608
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,200
Thank you.

609
00:47:27,866 --> 00:47:28,916
Look here.

610
00:47:30,566 --> 00:47:33,498
The castle was last
purchased in 1983

611
00:47:33,499 --> 00:47:36,799
by Lyndover Limited,
a trading company.

612
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,167
Thank you.
Okay.

613
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,267
"Graves."

614
00:48:49,167 --> 00:48:51,565
You're a lucky guy.

615
00:48:51,566 --> 00:48:53,465
X-rays show no sign
of cerebral damage

616
00:48:53,466 --> 00:48:54,965
or concussion.

617
00:48:54,966 --> 00:48:56,932
However, I'd be more
careful about the company

618
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:58,200
I keep in the future.

619
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,598
Would you excuse us, doctor?

620
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:02,649
Yeah.

621
00:49:05,167 --> 00:49:08,199
Hey, chief. Now what?

622
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,199
Well, "now what" is we're
gonna have a little talk

623
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,465
about life, MacGyver.

624
00:49:11,466 --> 00:49:13,533
Life and manners.

625
00:49:14,533 --> 00:49:15,999
All right.

626
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:16,999
Well...

627
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,498
when a stranger conducts

628
00:49:18,499 --> 00:49:20,598
a private investigation
in my city

629
00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:23,199
and refuses to share
his findings with the police,

630
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,800
I call that bad manners.

631
00:49:26,699 --> 00:49:27,766
I agree.

632
00:49:28,084 --> 00:49:31,498
So, what were
you doing at the, uh,

633
00:49:31,499 --> 00:49:34,232
laboratory and the London Library?

634
00:49:34,233 --> 00:49:35,283
You find something?

635
00:49:36,699 --> 00:49:39,298
With all due respect,
chief inspector,

636
00:49:39,299 --> 00:49:42,232
I don't feel free to
comment on that right now.

637
00:49:42,233 --> 00:49:44,267
Don't test me, MacGyver.

638
00:49:45,633 --> 00:49:47,032
You know...

639
00:49:47,033 --> 00:49:48,498
throwing your allegiance

640
00:49:48,499 --> 00:49:50,132
to scum like Tony Graves

641
00:49:50,133 --> 00:49:51,665
can only bring you more trouble.

642
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:53,199
Like today.

643
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,800
Nobody has my allegiance.

644
00:49:54,801 --> 00:49:57,266
That particular association

645
00:49:57,267 --> 00:49:59,437
makes me seriously
question your motives.

646
00:49:59,438 --> 00:50:03,166
I have no association,
no obligation, no ties.

647
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:05,266
I am strictly in this
for personal reasons.

648
00:50:05,267 --> 00:50:08,199
Well I do have obligations
and associations.

649
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,431
To Britain and
her subjects, MacGyver.

650
00:50:10,432 --> 00:50:13,966
For your sake, let's hope
we're on the same side.

651
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:22,865
It doesn't make sense.

652
00:50:22,866 --> 00:50:24,166
A nuclear plant,

653
00:50:24,167 --> 00:50:26,899
built without detection,
and so close.

654
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,698
I've known Tony for many years.

655
00:50:28,699 --> 00:50:30,065
I can't imagine him
being involved

656
00:50:30,066 --> 00:50:31,399
in anything so repugnant.

657
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,150
Why even though...

658
00:50:34,684 --> 00:50:36,765
What?

659
00:50:36,766 --> 00:50:39,565
Tony always had
a very strong drive

660
00:50:39,566 --> 00:50:41,032
for material gain.

661
00:50:41,033 --> 00:50:44,199
That's why we had to
sever our business ties.

662
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,298
Really?

663
00:50:45,299 --> 00:50:47,166
But selling nuclear weapons?

664
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:49,065
That's global terrorism.

665
00:50:49,066 --> 00:50:50,732
Tony fought that all his life.

666
00:50:50,733 --> 00:50:52,331
Look at his service record.

667
00:50:52,332 --> 00:50:55,865
Twelve years, U.S. Intelligence,
an antiterrorist expert.

668
00:50:55,866 --> 00:50:58,465
Yeah. I know.

669
00:50:58,466 --> 00:50:59,765
I ran a background check on him,

670
00:50:59,766 --> 00:51:01,732
and aside from that incident

671
00:51:01,733 --> 00:51:04,698
with British Intelligence,
he was clean.

672
00:51:04,699 --> 00:51:06,565
We must call in the authorities.

673
00:51:06,566 --> 00:51:07,965
This is getting too big.

674
00:51:07,966 --> 00:51:09,365
No, wait a minute,
wait a minute. J-

675
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:11,532
Don't we want to see
how deep this thing goes?

676
00:51:11,533 --> 00:51:13,032
Yes, we must.

677
00:51:13,033 --> 00:51:14,498
For Tony's sake.

678
00:51:14,499 --> 00:51:16,665
Chief Superintendent Capshaw
might very well use this

679
00:51:16,666 --> 00:51:19,267
as an opportunity
for vengeance against him.

680
00:51:22,233 --> 00:51:24,365
This note that you found...

681
00:51:24,366 --> 00:51:25,932
was there anything on it?

682
00:51:25,933 --> 00:51:27,899
A name, initials.

683
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:30,730
Anything that might lead us
to my brother's murderers?

684
00:51:34,066 --> 00:51:37,365
Uh. No, I didn't get
a chance to read it.

685
00:51:37,366 --> 00:51:39,166
Do what you have
to do, MacGyver.

686
00:51:39,167 --> 00:51:40,633
I back you a hundred percent.

687
00:52:05,533 --> 00:52:06,583
Graves.

688
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:00,649
Oh, man.

689
00:53:03,167 --> 00:53:04,598
Armed police.
Don't move!

690
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:05,649
Stay down!

691
00:53:08,233 --> 00:53:10,632
I said, stay down!

692
00:53:10,633 --> 00:53:11,732
I warn you, MacGyver,

693
00:53:11,733 --> 00:53:13,565
I get nervous in the presence
of murderers.

694
00:53:13,566 --> 00:53:14,832
What? Wait a minute.

695
00:53:14,833 --> 00:53:16,266
Shut up.

696
00:53:16,267 --> 00:53:17,317
Don't even try.

697
00:53:20,066 --> 00:53:21,116
This yours?

698
00:53:21,117 --> 00:53:23,698
Well, I'm sure it's
covered in prints.

699
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:25,365
Maybe even a blood sample.

700
00:53:25,366 --> 00:53:26,665
Come on, that's a plant.

701
00:53:26,666 --> 00:53:28,232
I didn't kill anybody.

702
00:53:28,233 --> 00:53:29,166
Oh, really?

703
00:53:29,167 --> 00:53:30,217
Sir.

704
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:34,032
So this wouldn't be
your watch crystal

705
00:53:34,033 --> 00:53:35,083
and bezel then?

706
00:53:40,399 --> 00:53:41,765
Come on, this is a setup.

707
00:53:41,766 --> 00:53:42,799
Don't move!

708
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,565
You gotta listen to me!

709
00:53:44,566 --> 00:53:47,696
I'm placing you under arrest for
the murder of Anthony Graves.

710
00:53:52,167 --> 00:53:53,865
Aah! Ow.

711
00:53:53,866 --> 00:53:54,916
After him!
Come on!

712
00:53:57,167 --> 00:53:58,666
Ah.

713
00:54:57,699 --> 00:54:58,749
Come on.

714
00:55:14,699 --> 00:55:15,749
Ow.

715
00:55:16,866 --> 00:55:17,916
Ow.

716
00:56:44,966 --> 00:56:46,565
Was this door always like this?

717
00:56:46,566 --> 00:56:47,899
No.

718
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:50,566
Can you get to the back
of the carriage, please. Now.

719
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:10,532
He got out! You checked
every carriage?

720
00:57:10,533 --> 00:57:12,000
Yeah.
Come on then! Come on.

721
00:57:59,133 --> 00:58:00,199
MacGyver.

722
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,932
Where have you been?

723
00:58:01,933 --> 00:58:03,365
You set me up!

724
00:58:03,366 --> 00:58:04,431
Are you crazy?

725
00:58:04,432 --> 00:58:06,099
Capshaw was waiting for me.

726
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:08,431
Graves was dead,
and evidence againstme

727
00:58:08,432 --> 00:58:10,166
was conveniently beside the body.

728
00:58:10,167 --> 00:58:11,267
Tony, dead?

729
00:58:12,332 --> 00:58:13,865
Oh, that's good.

730
00:58:13,866 --> 00:58:15,232
That's so very good.

731
00:58:15,233 --> 00:58:17,598
The KGB should be proud of you.

732
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:19,298
MacGyver, I didn't do it.

733
00:58:19,299 --> 00:58:20,732
You and Frederick
were the only ones

734
00:58:20,733 --> 00:58:21,993
who knew I was going there.

735
00:58:21,994 --> 00:58:24,598
That's not necessarily true.

736
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:26,132
Yeah? Well then, who?!

737
00:58:26,133 --> 00:58:27,298
All right.

738
00:58:27,299 --> 00:58:28,899
Superintendent Capshaw.

739
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:31,266
I'm serious.
Think about it!

740
00:58:31,267 --> 00:58:32,999
You've been followed
from the start.

741
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,632
He could have followed us
to Frederick's,

742
00:58:34,633 --> 00:58:36,166
maybe even wired his study.

743
00:58:36,167 --> 00:58:38,665
Tony could have been his partner.

744
00:58:38,666 --> 00:58:40,431
So Capshaw knows
Tony was a suspect,

745
00:58:40,432 --> 00:58:42,362
kills him and frames you
for the crime.

746
00:58:42,363 --> 00:58:45,232
It could have been
a conspiracy all along.

747
00:58:45,233 --> 00:58:47,632
Tony had law-enforcement
assistance.

748
00:58:47,633 --> 00:58:49,331
And all that hostility
between them

749
00:58:49,332 --> 00:58:51,498
was just a facade.

750
00:58:51,499 --> 00:58:52,632
Capshaw could have ordered

751
00:58:52,633 --> 00:58:54,065
the attack on you in the sewers.

752
00:58:54,066 --> 00:58:56,166
That's how he got the evidence.

753
00:58:56,167 --> 00:58:57,565
If it had been me, why would I

754
00:58:57,566 --> 00:58:59,200
have bothered to save your life?

755
00:59:00,533 --> 00:59:02,598
You dragged me
into this.

756
00:59:02,599 --> 00:59:05,399
I wanted to put the KGB
behind me, remember?

757
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:13,099
Don't you know how I feel?

758
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:15,733
I'm on your side, all the way.

759
00:59:27,133 --> 00:59:28,183
I need to think.

760
00:59:41,766 --> 00:59:43,816
Nothing would surprise me
at this point.

761
00:59:46,766 --> 00:59:48,166
And now I'm a suspect.

762
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:50,199
That's beautiful.
Beautiful.

763
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,965
I can help.

764
00:59:51,966 --> 00:59:53,565
My KGB contact, Nikolai,

765
00:59:53,566 --> 00:59:56,732
there's a rumor he's
found new employment.

766
00:59:56,733 --> 00:59:57,765
So?

767
00:59:57,766 --> 01:00:00,899
His expertise is
in nuclear facilities.

768
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:02,465
It could be
only one thing.

769
01:00:02,466 --> 01:00:05,331
If it's true, I can verify
the location of the plant

770
01:00:05,332 --> 01:00:07,382
and find out what kind of
security it has.

771
01:00:07,824 --> 01:00:11,398
What makes you think
he'd tell you?

772
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:13,832
He'll tell me.

773
01:00:13,833 --> 01:00:15,332
I'm KGB, remember?

774
01:00:16,766 --> 01:00:18,800
Ex-KGB, remember?

775
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:21,950
Of course.

776
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,099
The circumstances
do not relieve you

777
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:29,865
of your legal responsibilities.

778
01:00:29,866 --> 01:00:31,598
My family has been murdered.

779
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:32,632
My only brother killed.

780
01:00:32,633 --> 01:00:34,799
And you speak to me like this?

781
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:35,899
How dare you!

782
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:38,498
Mr. Moran. I am
requesting information

783
01:00:38,499 --> 01:00:41,765
as to the where abouts
of Mr. MacGyver, a fugitive.

784
01:00:41,766 --> 01:00:44,365
With holding such
information is a crime.

785
01:00:44,366 --> 01:00:47,498
I resent the accusation.

786
01:00:47,499 --> 01:00:50,267
And your insensitivity,
chief superintendent.

787
01:00:51,432 --> 01:00:52,566
Now get out.

788
01:00:54,766 --> 01:00:56,100
As you say.

789
01:01:10,666 --> 01:01:11,965
Yeah?

790
01:01:11,966 --> 01:01:13,632
I'm outside Nikolai's now.

791
01:01:13,633 --> 01:01:15,765
We rendezvous in exactly one hour.

792
01:01:15,766 --> 01:01:17,331
If something happens
and I can't make it,

793
01:01:17,332 --> 01:01:19,533
you must leave without me.

794
01:01:30,766 --> 01:01:32,133
Natalia!

795
01:01:33,167 --> 01:01:34,217
Ah.

796
01:01:53,133 --> 01:01:54,533
Who are those guys?

797
01:02:03,299 --> 01:02:04,499
Get in!

798
01:05:56,299 --> 01:05:57,900
Morning, gents.

799
01:06:40,977 --> 01:06:44,632
Where you heading
on those old plates?

800
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:45,632
What?

801
01:06:45,633 --> 01:06:47,665
Plates of meat. Feet.

802
01:06:47,666 --> 01:06:50,166
Oh, uh, Carcroft Castle.

803
01:06:50,167 --> 01:06:52,466
You don't look like
royalty to me.

804
01:06:53,299 --> 01:06:54,349
Jump on.

805
01:06:54,533 --> 01:06:56,431
Come on.

806
01:06:56,432 --> 01:06:57,999
What's your name?
MacGyver.

807
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,532
Scottish?
Eh...

808
01:06:59,533 --> 01:07:01,331
Just call me Plato.

809
01:07:01,332 --> 01:07:02,365
You like music?

810
01:07:02,366 --> 01:07:03,365
Sure.

811
01:07:03,366 --> 01:07:05,132
Good.

812
01:07:05,133 --> 01:07:06,632
*I'm ready to rock *

813
01:07:06,633 --> 01:07:07,966
Hold on. Here we go.

814
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:20,699
Thank you, sir.

815
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:29,469
Hey Plato, would you
mind stopping?

816
01:07:30,566 --> 01:07:32,498
Can you cut the engines?

817
01:07:32,499 --> 01:07:34,033
And the music?

818
01:07:36,833 --> 01:07:39,232
I think that's for me, my friend.

819
01:07:39,233 --> 01:07:41,398
Listen, it's a long story.

820
01:07:41,399 --> 01:07:42,598
But I'm innocent.

821
01:07:42,599 --> 01:07:44,099
Now, I don't want to
get you in trouble,

822
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:45,999
but I could use your help here.

823
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,532
Us blokes got to stick together.

824
01:07:47,533 --> 01:07:49,698
Look like a couple
of ices anyway.

825
01:07:49,699 --> 01:07:51,632
What?
Ice cream freezers.

826
01:07:51,633 --> 01:07:53,431
Geezers.
Oh.

827
01:07:53,432 --> 01:07:54,812
See you round the other side.

828
01:08:29,699 --> 01:08:31,533
Switch the engine off please, sir.

829
01:08:32,666 --> 01:08:33,733
And the music.

830
01:08:34,614 --> 01:08:37,032
We're looking for this man.

831
01:08:37,033 --> 01:08:38,166
Have you seen him

832
01:08:38,167 --> 01:08:40,199
or anyone that looks like him?
Sorry.

833
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,232
If you do, will you notify
the police immediately?

834
01:08:42,233 --> 01:08:43,698
Yes, officer.
Yeah.

835
01:08:43,699 --> 01:08:45,566
Put your helmet on.
Yes. Yes, sir.

836
01:08:55,432 --> 01:08:56,532
Hello, ladies.

837
01:08:56,533 --> 01:08:58,213
We're looking for this gentleman.

838
01:09:34,966 --> 01:09:36,632
You're a good man, Plato.

839
01:09:36,633 --> 01:09:38,599
You be lucky, MacGyver.

840
01:10:21,332 --> 01:10:23,322
So you're all together
there, are you?

841
01:13:49,733 --> 01:13:51,366
Hello? Yes.

842
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:07,398
I realize that,
but you must understand,

843
01:14:07,399 --> 01:14:09,900
the serum guarantees truth,
not cooperation.

844
01:14:11,299 --> 01:14:12,899
I know.

845
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:14,566
Very well. I'll do my best.

846
01:14:15,633 --> 01:14:17,199
Are you ready to begin?

847
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,633
I'm tired.

848
01:14:19,699 --> 01:14:22,298
Elise, don't fight it.

849
01:14:22,299 --> 01:14:24,132
You can't lie with the serum.

850
01:14:24,133 --> 01:14:25,765
I'm tired.

851
01:14:25,766 --> 01:14:27,365
We need the software code

852
01:14:27,366 --> 01:14:29,698
to your father's spectrometer.

853
01:14:29,699 --> 01:14:31,999
What makes it so sensitive?

854
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,099
How can we upgrade ours?

855
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:36,465
I told you everything.

856
01:14:36,466 --> 01:14:38,532
You know as much as I do.

857
01:14:38,533 --> 01:14:39,965
I worked with your father

858
01:14:39,966 --> 01:14:42,398
for over five years.

859
01:14:42,399 --> 01:14:45,732
And I have access
to almost all his research.

860
01:14:45,733 --> 01:14:50,099
But I know he kept certain
information to himself.

861
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:53,498
Only one who had access
to all the files was you.

862
01:14:53,499 --> 01:14:54,865
I did not see the files

863
01:14:54,866 --> 01:14:56,099
you refer to.

864
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:57,698
We must have that information

865
01:14:57,699 --> 01:15:01,199
to secure the plant
from further detection.

866
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:04,032
Elise, they will kill you.

867
01:15:04,033 --> 01:15:05,799
Now, don't be foolish, my dear.

868
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:07,900
They'll kill you, you know that.

869
01:15:10,699 --> 01:15:13,765
We've been through this
so many times before.

870
01:15:13,766 --> 01:15:16,232
Elise, I must have an answer.

871
01:15:16,233 --> 01:15:17,332
Try the library.

872
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,050
MacGyver.

873
01:15:27,366 --> 01:15:28,833
My father. Is he...?

874
01:15:30,599 --> 01:15:31,800
I'm sorry.

875
01:15:36,299 --> 01:15:37,666
Elise...

876
01:15:38,599 --> 01:15:39,965
They drugged me.

877
01:15:39,966 --> 01:15:41,016
I woke up here.

878
01:15:44,733 --> 01:15:47,065
Who are "they," Elise?

879
01:15:47,066 --> 01:15:48,398
I don't know.

880
01:15:48,399 --> 01:15:52,799
I answer questions
about the spectrometer.

881
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,465
They want one...

882
01:15:54,466 --> 01:15:56,032
to monitor emissions.

883
01:15:56,033 --> 01:15:58,465
Avoid another detection.

884
01:15:58,466 --> 01:16:01,532
They're processing nuclear
materials in a facility

885
01:16:01,533 --> 01:16:03,331
under the castle.

886
01:16:03,332 --> 01:16:04,382
What?

887
01:16:04,633 --> 01:16:05,732
You must hurry.

888
01:16:05,733 --> 01:16:08,832
I heard them talking.

889
01:16:08,833 --> 01:16:11,398
The first shipment leaves today.

890
01:16:11,399 --> 01:16:13,498
Two tactical weapons.

891
01:16:13,499 --> 01:16:15,298
I'm sorry.

892
01:16:15,299 --> 01:16:16,832
I helped them.

893
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:18,532
I tried not to.
I really tried.

894
01:16:18,533 --> 01:16:19,965
No. It's all right.

895
01:16:19,966 --> 01:16:21,499
It's okay, honey.

896
01:16:22,599 --> 01:16:24,432
I'm gonna get you out of here.

897
01:16:27,599 --> 01:16:28,900
I'll be back.

898
01:18:02,599 --> 01:18:03,966
Don't touch that.

899
01:18:06,066 --> 01:18:07,116
Please.

900
01:18:10,033 --> 01:18:11,800
I was afraid you'd get this far.

901
01:18:13,366 --> 01:18:14,965
Pity, MacGyver.

902
01:18:14,966 --> 01:18:17,399
You're just too good
for your own good.

903
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:27,932
It was you all the time.

904
01:18:27,933 --> 01:18:29,799
It's kind of hard to believe

905
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:30,999
anybody would be sick enough

906
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,598
to order the death
of his own brother.

907
01:18:33,599 --> 01:18:36,498
Difficult decisions are the lot
of the entrepreneur, MacGyver.

908
01:18:36,499 --> 01:18:38,532
Especially with stakes this high.

909
01:18:38,533 --> 01:18:40,032
Yeah, what stakes?

910
01:18:40,033 --> 01:18:41,832
Change is everywhere, my friend.

911
01:18:41,833 --> 01:18:45,199
Yeltsin's democracy
could be the first to fall.

912
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:46,965
There's a Communist coup
in the works,

913
01:18:46,966 --> 01:18:48,365
perhaps from the inside.

914
01:18:48,366 --> 01:18:51,132
But as yet, my clients
are organizing themselves

915
01:18:51,133 --> 01:18:52,498
from the outside.

916
01:18:52,499 --> 01:18:55,032
Profits will be enormous.

917
01:18:55,033 --> 01:18:58,033
You'd put the whole world
at risk...for profit?

918
01:18:59,599 --> 01:19:00,865
Beautiful.

919
01:19:00,866 --> 01:19:03,398
It is indeed beautiful.

920
01:19:03,399 --> 01:19:05,331
I accomplished the impossible.

921
01:19:05,332 --> 01:19:07,099
A state-of-the-art
nuclear facility

922
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:09,199
right here
in the heart of Britain.

923
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:11,765
Built...without detection.

924
01:19:11,766 --> 01:19:12,732
Almost.

925
01:19:12,733 --> 01:19:13,783
Paul found it.

926
01:19:14,466 --> 01:19:15,698
Unfortunately.

927
01:19:15,699 --> 01:19:17,932
It took me ten years
to build this plant.

928
01:19:17,933 --> 01:19:19,698
Our products will be
used to take control

929
01:19:19,699 --> 01:19:21,099
of Russia's nuclear arsenal,

930
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:25,431
before the Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty takes effect.

931
01:19:25,432 --> 01:19:28,498
I foresaw the demand,
and now the market is mine.

932
01:19:28,499 --> 01:19:32,632
I am sole broker for nuclear
capability and devices...

933
01:19:32,633 --> 01:19:34,166
for the world.

934
01:19:34,167 --> 01:19:37,365
Well, what about conscience?

935
01:19:37,366 --> 01:19:39,166
What aboutlaw?

936
01:19:39,167 --> 01:19:40,999
This-

937
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,199
This is a violation of
the most basic and crucial laws

938
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:46,498
of civilized society.

939
01:19:46,499 --> 01:19:48,799
You're offering
genocide for profit.

940
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,331
What are you thinking?

941
01:19:50,332 --> 01:19:51,932
As I see it, MacGyver,

942
01:19:51,933 --> 01:19:54,665
the law is simply one of
the risks of doing business.

943
01:19:54,666 --> 01:19:57,199
Well, as I see it, Fred...

944
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:59,599
you're just one more
cheap crook.

945
01:20:04,167 --> 01:20:05,217
Oh!

946
01:20:18,633 --> 01:20:20,399
Your logic sucks.

947
01:21:37,966 --> 01:21:40,466
"Tactical nuclear device."

948
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:51,431
Damn you.

949
01:21:51,432 --> 01:21:53,632
For always succeeding.

950
01:21:53,633 --> 01:21:56,799
For making me the one
to have to kill you.

951
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:57,799
Well...

952
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,099
I'm real sorry about that.

953
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:00,999
I didn't want it
to end this way...

954
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,465
Oh, knock it off.

955
01:22:02,466 --> 01:22:05,132
But certain ends
require drastic means.

956
01:22:05,133 --> 01:22:07,065
Yeah.

957
01:22:07,066 --> 01:22:09,698
Ex-KGB my butt.

958
01:22:09,699 --> 01:22:11,832
This is beyond KGB.

959
01:22:11,833 --> 01:22:13,298
Beyond anything.

960
01:22:13,299 --> 01:22:15,166
This is my family, my country,

961
01:22:15,167 --> 01:22:16,865
the future of the Soviet Union.

962
01:22:16,866 --> 01:22:19,565
Natalia, there is
no Soviet Union.

963
01:22:19,566 --> 01:22:20,932
No.

964
01:22:20,933 --> 01:22:23,398
I refuse to accept that.

965
01:22:23,399 --> 01:22:24,899
I am a patriot.

966
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:26,665
I will never allow
the dissolution

967
01:22:26,666 --> 01:22:28,498
of the KGB or the Soviet.

968
01:22:28,499 --> 01:22:30,298
They stole my country.

969
01:22:30,299 --> 01:22:31,632
I want it back.

970
01:22:31,633 --> 01:22:33,732
That world is over.

971
01:22:33,733 --> 01:22:35,365
No, that's lies!
I won't listen.

972
01:22:35,366 --> 01:22:38,999
Your country is in the middle of
a massive transition right now.

973
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,532
Can't you see that what you're
doing is counterproductive?

974
01:22:41,533 --> 01:22:45,665
I have a mission to preserve
the Soviet state.

975
01:22:45,666 --> 01:22:46,932
You stand in the way.

976
01:22:46,933 --> 01:22:48,665
Will you listen to yourself?

977
01:22:48,666 --> 01:22:50,398
You don't understand.

978
01:22:50,399 --> 01:22:52,232
You could never understand.

979
01:22:52,233 --> 01:22:54,232
No one's ever stolen
your government,

980
01:22:54,233 --> 01:22:55,493
discarded your beliefs,

981
01:22:55,766 --> 01:22:58,232
left your people without dignity.

982
01:22:58,233 --> 01:22:59,533
With nothing.

983
01:23:02,399 --> 01:23:04,565
Well...

984
01:23:04,566 --> 01:23:07,598
you seem to have things
well in hand, my dear.

985
01:23:07,599 --> 01:23:08,999
So, MacGyver...

986
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,199
since you've been good enough
to deliver the evidence

987
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,099
you so cleverly hid
in the sewers,

988
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:16,266
there seems no further reason
to delay your demise.

989
01:23:16,267 --> 01:23:17,832
Shoot him!

990
01:23:17,833 --> 01:23:18,832
Can I say something...

991
01:23:18,833 --> 01:23:19,900
before you do?

992
01:23:21,666 --> 01:23:23,365
Natalia, y-

993
01:23:23,366 --> 01:23:26,665
You realize
you're a phony...

994
01:23:26,666 --> 01:23:28,665
and a total hypocrite here.

995
01:23:28,666 --> 01:23:32,065
You don't care about
your people or your beliefs.

996
01:23:32,066 --> 01:23:33,065
You're on the verge of

997
01:23:33,066 --> 01:23:34,498
killing thousands and thousands

998
01:23:34,499 --> 01:23:36,899
of people for
your precious Communism.

999
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:40,365
And your partner
in this...noble scheme...

1000
01:23:40,366 --> 01:23:43,298
is a greed-driven
billionaire capitalist

1001
01:23:43,299 --> 01:23:44,298
like Freddy boy here.

1002
01:23:44,299 --> 01:23:45,349
Shoot him!

1003
01:23:46,566 --> 01:23:48,032
Some Communist.

1004
01:23:48,033 --> 01:23:50,032
I admit there's
a certain hypocrisy

1005
01:23:50,033 --> 01:23:51,865
to that aspect
of the arrangement.

1006
01:23:51,866 --> 01:23:53,698
Just a little.

1007
01:23:53,699 --> 01:23:56,232
But quite honestly, it's been
my intention from the start...

1008
01:23:56,233 --> 01:23:57,283
to correct it.

1009
01:24:42,633 --> 01:24:45,732
Separator temperature
controller inoperative.

1010
01:24:45,733 --> 01:24:48,431

controller is inoperative.

1012
01:24:52,699 --> 01:24:55,266
Please restore immediately.

1013
01:24:55,267 --> 01:24:57,933
System will fail in 60 seconds.

1014
01:25:02,299 --> 01:25:04,632
Separator temperature
is increasing.

1015
01:25:04,633 --> 01:25:07,633
System will fail in 50 seconds.

1016
01:25:12,933 --> 01:25:15,166
Separator temperature critical.

1017
01:25:15,167 --> 01:25:17,900
System will fail in 40 seconds.

1018
01:25:25,066 --> 01:25:27,466
System failure in 30 seconds.

1019
01:25:32,267 --> 01:25:34,765
System has been disconnected.

1020
01:25:34,766 --> 01:25:35,933
Thank you.

1021
01:26:12,933 --> 01:26:13,983
MacGyver!

1022
01:26:36,466 --> 01:26:37,698
Warning.

1023
01:26:37,699 --> 01:26:39,532
Uranium separator
failure imminent.

1024
01:26:39,533 --> 01:26:40,865
No! Stop!

1025
01:26:40,866 --> 01:26:42,565
I hate you!

1026
01:26:42,566 --> 01:26:43,665
Give it up!

1027
01:26:43,666 --> 01:26:45,432
Nuclear systems jeopardized.

1028
01:26:47,733 --> 01:26:49,965
Automatic override engaged.

1029
01:26:49,966 --> 01:26:51,933
Nuclear emergency averted.

1030
01:26:54,633 --> 01:26:58,665
Automatic override
has been bypassed.

1031
01:26:58,666 --> 01:27:00,498
System failure imminent.

1032
01:27:00,499 --> 01:27:02,865
All nuclear systems at risk.

1033
01:27:02,866 --> 01:27:04,732
Repeat:

1034
01:27:04,733 --> 01:27:07,331
system failure imminent.

1035
01:27:07,332 --> 01:27:09,699
All nuclear systems at risk.

1036
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,066
Ah!

1037
01:27:17,299 --> 01:27:21,331
Nuclear systems operating
beyond design limits.

1038
01:27:21,332 --> 01:27:22,765
Red alert.

1039
01:27:22,766 --> 01:27:25,199

1040
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:26,598
Repeat.

1041
01:27:26,599 --> 01:27:30,465
Nuclear systems operating
beyond design limits.

1042
01:27:30,466 --> 01:27:32,800
Red alert.
Plant failure imminent.

1043
01:27:46,033 --> 01:27:48,431
What have you done?
I've armed the bomb.

1044
01:27:48,432 --> 01:27:51,065
It can't be disarmed
without a trivet wrench.

1045
01:27:51,066 --> 01:27:53,232
You lose, MacGyver.

1046
01:27:53,233 --> 01:27:54,566
Now we all die.

1047
01:27:58,399 --> 01:28:02,733
Nuclear detonation
in one minute, 30 seconds.

1048

beyond design limits.

1054
01:28:21,432 --> 01:28:23,933
Red alert.

1058
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,665
Uranium separators destroyed.

1059
01:28:55,666 --> 01:28:57,899
Nuclear facility is inoperative.

1060
01:28:57,900 --> 01:29:01,133

1063
01:29:14,666 --> 01:29:17,200
Detonation in 15 seconds.

1064
01:29:18,399 --> 01:29:21,598
Detonation in ten seconds.

1065
01:29:21,599 --> 01:29:24,932
Nine, eight, seven,

1066
01:29:24,933 --> 01:29:27,832
six, five, four,

1067
01:29:27,833 --> 01:29:29,833
three, two...

1068
01:29:31,533 --> 01:29:34,598
Nuclear detonation averted.

1069
01:29:34,599 --> 01:29:37,332
Nuclear device disarmed.

1070
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:54,633
You never give up, do you?

1071
01:29:56,066 --> 01:29:58,066
I guess it just wasn't
meant to be.

1072
01:30:09,833 --> 01:30:12,266
I owe you an apology, MacGyver.

1073
01:30:12,267 --> 01:30:14,665
We are on the same side.

1074
01:30:14,666 --> 01:30:15,716
Thanks for your help.

1075
01:30:17,466 --> 01:30:18,632
You bet, chief.

1076
01:30:18,633 --> 01:30:20,699
See you soon.
I hope.

1077
01:30:42,699 --> 01:30:44,832
My father cared
so much for this planet.

1078
01:30:44,833 --> 01:30:47,266
He just wanted to do some good.

1079
01:30:47,267 --> 01:30:48,865
He did.

1080
01:30:48,866 --> 01:30:50,932
The world's a safer place
because of Paul.

1081
01:30:50,933 --> 01:30:52,598
Maybe.

1082
01:30:52,599 --> 01:30:53,698
But my father,

1083
01:30:53,699 --> 01:30:55,033
your friend, he's gone.

1084
01:30:57,267 --> 01:30:59,833
Then I guess it's up to us.

1085
01:30:59,883 --> 01:31:04,433
