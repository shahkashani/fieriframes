1
00:00:49,573 --> 00:00:54,272
A beginning
is a very delicate time.

2
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:59,578
Know then, that it is
the year 10,191.

3
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:04,553
The known universe is ruled by the
Padishah Emperor Shaddam the Fourth,

4
00:01:04,622 --> 00:01:07,955
my father.

5
00:01:08,025 --> 00:01:11,688
In this time, the most
precious substance in the universe...

6
00:01:11,762 --> 00:01:14,492
is the spice, melange.

7
00:01:14,565 --> 00:01:18,194
The spice extends life.

8
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:22,603
The spice
expands consciousness.

9
00:01:22,673 --> 00:01:27,337
The spice is vital
to space travel.

10
00:01:27,411 --> 00:01:29,902
The Spacing Guild
and its navigators,

11
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,314
who the spice has mutated
over 4,000 years,

12
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:37,081
use the orange spice gas,

13
00:01:37,154 --> 00:01:41,488
which gives them
the ability to fold space.

14
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:45,723
That is, travel to any part
of the universe...

15
00:01:45,796 --> 00:01:48,026
without moving.

16
00:01:48,098 --> 00:01:50,032
Oh, yes.

17
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,364
I forgot to tell you.

18
00:01:52,436 --> 00:01:58,033
The spice exists on only one planet
in the entire universe.

19
00:01:58,108 --> 00:02:03,637
A desolate, dry planet
with vast deserts.

20
00:02:03,714 --> 00:02:09,448
Hidden away within the rocks of these
deserts are a people known as the Fremen,

21
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,318
who have long
held a prophecy...

22
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:14,949
that a man would come,

23
00:02:15,025 --> 00:02:17,016
a messiah,

24
00:02:17,094 --> 00:02:20,996
who would lead them
to true freedom.

25
00:02:21,065 --> 00:02:24,660
The planet is Arrakis,

26
00:02:24,735 --> 00:02:29,502
also known as Dune.

27
00:03:52,756 --> 00:03:55,520
[Wind Howling]

28
00:03:55,593 --> 00:03:59,051
A secret report
within the Guild.

29
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:02,257
Four planets have come
to our attention...

30
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:06,633
regarding a plot which could
jeopardize spice production.

31
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:10,800
Planet Arrakis,
source of the spice.

32
00:04:10,874 --> 00:04:15,072
Planet Caladan,
home of House Atreides.

33
00:04:15,145 --> 00:04:19,514
Planet Giedi Prime,
home of House Harkonnen.

34
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:24,611
Planet Kaitain, home of the Emperor
of the known universe.

35
00:04:26,156 --> 00:04:29,557
Send a third-stage
guild navigator to Kaitain...

36
00:04:29,627 --> 00:04:32,619
to demand details
from the Emperor.

37
00:04:32,696 --> 00:04:35,187
The spice must flow.

38
00:05:01,025 --> 00:05:02,959
[Voices, Indistinct]

39
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:25,480
- Father,
- Irulan, you must leave.

40
00:05:46,503 --> 00:05:48,437
A third-stage guild navigator...

41
00:05:48,505 --> 00:05:50,564
will be here within minutes.

42
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,575
We felt his presence.

43
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,873
I shall want telepathy
during his visit...

44
00:05:54,945 --> 00:05:57,004
and a report
when we're finished.

45
00:05:57,081 --> 00:06:01,017
I am your Truthsayer,
my lord.

46
00:06:01,085 --> 00:06:02,950
He's here, my lord.

47
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,612
The Bene Gesserit witch
must leave.

48
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:37,745
Leave us.

49
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:40,688
Yes, my lord.

50
00:06:50,834 --> 00:06:52,768
We are alone.

51
00:07:30,974 --> 00:07:32,908
[Breathing]

52
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:42,446
- We have just folded space from lx.
- Yes?

53
00:07:44,521 --> 00:07:46,455
How was your journey?

54
00:07:46,523 --> 00:07:51,756
Many machines on lx.
New machines.

55
00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:54,821
Oh? Yes.

56
00:07:54,898 --> 00:08:00,165
Better than those on Richese.

57
00:08:00,237 --> 00:08:05,971
You are transparent.
I see many things.

58
00:08:06,043 --> 00:08:10,503
I see plans within plans.

59
00:08:10,581 --> 00:08:14,130
I see two great houses,

60
00:08:14,263 --> 00:08:19,530
House Atreides,
House Harkonnen, feuding.

61
00:08:19,602 --> 00:08:24,437
- I see you behind it.
- Yes.

62
00:08:24,507 --> 00:08:28,341
You must share with us.

63
00:08:28,411 --> 00:08:31,608
The Atreides House
is building a secret army...

64
00:08:31,681 --> 00:08:33,649
using a technique unknown to us.

65
00:08:33,716 --> 00:08:36,651
A technique involving sound.

66
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,552
The duke is becoming
more popular in the Landsraad.

67
00:08:39,622 --> 00:08:41,783
He could threaten me.

68
00:08:41,858 --> 00:08:45,726
I have ordered House Atreides
to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice,

69
00:08:45,795 --> 00:08:48,628
thus replacing their enemies,
the Harkonnens.

70
00:08:48,698 --> 00:08:53,192
House Atreides will not refuse because of the
tremendous power they think they will gain.

71
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:55,203
Then, at an appointed time,

72
00:08:55,271 --> 00:08:58,502
Baron Harkonnen
will return to Arrakis...

73
00:08:58,574 --> 00:09:01,134
and launch a sneak attack
on House Atreides.

74
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:06,113
I have promised the baron five legions
of my Sardaukar terror troops.

75
00:09:06,182 --> 00:09:10,710
So the Harkonnens
will rid you of House Atreides.

76
00:09:10,787 --> 00:09:12,448
Yes!

77
00:09:12,522 --> 00:09:15,457
[Navigator]
One small point.

78
00:09:15,525 --> 00:09:17,823
Here it comes.

79
00:09:17,894 --> 00:09:21,295
We ourselves perceive
a slight problem...

80
00:09:21,364 --> 00:09:24,060
within House Atreides.

81
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:28,695
Paul. Paul Atreides.

82
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:32,332
You mean, of course,
Duke Leto Atreides, his father.

83
00:09:32,408 --> 00:09:36,105
I mean Paul Atreides.

84
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:38,613
We want him killed.

85
00:09:40,616 --> 00:09:45,849
I did not say this.
I am not here.

86
00:09:45,922 --> 00:09:47,913
I understand.

87
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:23,252
[Inner Voice] Why would they
want the duke's son killed?

88
00:10:26,462 --> 00:10:32,298
We must have a look
at Paul Atreides, on Caladan.

89
00:10:46,682 --> 00:10:50,914
[Princess Irulan] The powerful Bene
Gesserit sisterhood for 90 generations...

90
00:10:50,987 --> 00:10:52,784
has been manipulating
bloodlines...

91
00:10:52,855 --> 00:10:56,985
to produce the Kwisatz Haderach,
a super being.

92
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:01,086
On Caladan, Jessica,
a member of the sisterhood...

93
00:11:01,163 --> 00:11:04,724
and the bound concubine
of Duke Leto Atreides,

94
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,792
had been ordered
to bear only daughters.

95
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,633
Because of her love
for the duke...

96
00:11:09,705 --> 00:11:14,199
she disobeyed
and gave birth to a son--

97
00:11:14,277 --> 00:11:18,714
Paul-- Paul Atreides.

98
00:11:26,088 --> 00:11:29,421
Here we are now, Caladan.

99
00:11:29,492 --> 00:11:34,862
And 19 light-years beyond,
beyond Bene Tleilax.

100
00:11:34,931 --> 00:11:38,765
[Man] The training planet
of the Mentats, the human computers.

101
00:11:38,834 --> 00:11:42,031
Know a Mentat
by his red-stained lips.

102
00:11:42,104 --> 00:11:44,197
[Inner Voice]
There. Arrakis.

103
00:11:44,273 --> 00:11:45,968
[Woman]
Spice mining.

104
00:11:46,042 --> 00:11:48,840
Carryalls lower
the harvester to the sand...

105
00:11:48,911 --> 00:11:51,379
and lift it off to safety
when a worm attacks.

106
00:11:51,447 --> 00:11:55,247
Worms attack
all rhythmic vibrations.

107
00:11:55,318 --> 00:12:00,654
Weather. See storms.
No precipitation.

108
00:12:00,723 --> 00:12:04,454
[Paul]
Never one drop of rain on Arrakis.

109
00:12:04,527 --> 00:12:08,395
And the Harkonnens are near.

110
00:12:08,464 --> 00:12:11,558
There. Giedi Prime
and the Baron Harkonnen.

111
00:12:11,634 --> 00:12:13,568
The enemy.

112
00:12:13,636 --> 00:12:16,537
[Man] The Baron Harkonnen has
sworn to destroy House Atreides...

113
00:12:16,606 --> 00:12:19,200
and steal the ducal signet ring
for himself.

114
00:12:37,827 --> 00:12:41,820
I know, Thufir.
I'm sitting with my back to the door.

115
00:12:41,897 --> 00:12:46,596
I heard you, Dr. Yueh,

116
00:12:46,669 --> 00:12:48,694
and Gurney
coming down the hall.

117
00:12:48,771 --> 00:12:52,207
Those sounds
could be imitated!

118
00:12:54,243 --> 00:12:56,177
I'd know the difference.

119
00:12:56,245 --> 00:12:59,942
[Inner Voice]
Yes, perhaps you would at that.

120
00:13:02,485 --> 00:13:04,453
My father sent you to test me.

121
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,715
Music, then?

122
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:11,726
No music.
I'm packing this for the crossing.

123
00:13:11,794 --> 00:13:15,560
- Shield practice.
- Gurney, we had practice this morning.

124
00:13:15,631 --> 00:13:17,565
I'm not in the mood.

125
00:13:17,633 --> 00:13:19,567
Not in the mood!

126
00:13:19,635 --> 00:13:24,095
- Mood's a thing for cattle and love play, not fighting!
- I'm sorry, Gurney.

127
00:13:24,173 --> 00:13:26,471
Not sorry enough.

128
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:40,720
[Inner Voice] What's wrong
with Gurney? He's not faking this.

129
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:44,726
Now, guard yourself for true!

130
00:14:03,979 --> 00:14:06,243
Is this what you seek?

131
00:14:06,315 --> 00:14:11,309
Good. The slow blade
penetrates the shield.

132
00:14:11,387 --> 00:14:14,413
But, uh, look down.

133
00:14:17,026 --> 00:14:20,086
[Gurney]
We'd have joined each other in death.

134
00:14:20,162 --> 00:14:22,926
You did seem finally
to get the mood.

135
00:14:30,773 --> 00:14:33,708
Would you really
have drawn my blood?

136
00:14:33,776 --> 00:14:36,301
If you'd have fought
one whit below your abilities,

137
00:14:36,378 --> 00:14:39,245
I'd have given you a good scar
to remind you.

138
00:14:42,885 --> 00:14:45,683
Things have been
so serious here lately.

139
00:14:45,755 --> 00:14:47,848
Soon we leave for Arrakis.

140
00:14:47,923 --> 00:14:50,892
Arrakis is real.

141
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,485
The Harkonnens are real.

142
00:14:55,097 --> 00:15:00,592
Dr. Yueh, do you have any information
on the worms of Arrakis?

143
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:04,366
I have obtained a filmbook
of a small specimen.

144
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,898
- Only 125 meters long.
- [Laughing]

145
00:15:07,977 --> 00:15:10,537
-Only?
-There have been documented sightings...

146
00:15:10,613 --> 00:15:15,812
of worms as large as 450 meters
in the deep desert.

147
00:15:15,885 --> 00:15:19,548
That's far from where
we'll be in Arrakeen.

148
00:15:19,622 --> 00:15:24,286
The desert belt and the south
polar region are marked forbidden.

149
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,521
[Paul]
How do the Fremen survive there?

150
00:15:26,595 --> 00:15:28,995
We don't know much
about the Fremen.

151
00:15:29,064 --> 00:15:31,828
They live in the deep desert,
some in the cities.

152
00:15:31,901 --> 00:15:34,870
They have blue within blue eyes.

153
00:15:34,937 --> 00:15:38,532
Oh, the eyes. Yes.

154
00:15:38,607 --> 00:15:41,599
The saturation of the blood
by the spice, melange.

155
00:15:41,677 --> 00:15:44,441
Could the spice affect us
in other ways?

156
00:15:44,513 --> 00:15:46,674
[Thufir]
Many dangers exist on Arrakis.

157
00:15:46,749 --> 00:15:50,515
For one, the Harkonnens
would not have given up...

158
00:15:50,586 --> 00:15:54,078
their CHOAM Company contract
so easily.

159
00:15:55,124 --> 00:15:58,616
The Harkonnens

It was known that the Harkonnens,
the former rulers of Arrakis,

I think they
