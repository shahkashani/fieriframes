- Amazing Mets.

Don't choke on your pride, Sull.

304

You ain't never gonna find
another one like Sam.

305
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:00,922
She made up her mind, Satch.
Nothin' I do is gonna change it.

306
00:23:01,022 --> 00:23:04,026
Nothin' you're willing to do.
- What's the story?

307
00:23:04,126 --> 00:23:08,546
Construction crew found a body,
actually, a skeleton.

308
00:23:11,135 --> 00:23:15,215
Okay. Well, be real careful
when you pull it out.

309
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:18,586
Make sure you get the dirt around it.
- Yes, sir.

310
00:23:18,686 --> 00:23:23,066
So, what's this construction?
- I think I'll visit the neighbors.

311
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:24,410
Yeah, okay.

312
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,490
What did they tear down here?
- Greek diner.

[Used to get breakfast there all the time.]

Careful. It's hot.
- Thank you, Mrs. Shepard.

316

Once that McDonald's opened up on
Dyckman, they lost all their business.

I see your son's on the job.
- Was.

318

Jack died a while back.

It's hard, I know.

320

It just seems like yesterday.

321

- Okay, Detective.

323

Give my regards to Steph.
- Sure will.

324
00:24:03,326 --> 00:24:05,882
This isn't gonna be anything
but a history lesson.

325
00:24:05,982 --> 00:24:08,277
Let's go back to the house.

326

Hey, Barney. How you doin'?
- Good.

327

There you go. Have a good night.
- Bye.

328

I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
- Hey, sounds good.

329
00:24:35,582 --> 00:24:37,754
I'm sorry Samantha couldn't make it.

330

Yeah, those grad school applications
are drivin' her crazy.

331
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,714
How's it comin'?
- I got the VCR hooked up.

332

It's just this friggin' clock.

333
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:50,734
Doesn't matter.

334
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:57,914
Goddamn it. I'm sorry, Mom.
- Hey, you know, it's all right.

335
00:24:58,014 --> 00:25:02,072
I'm sure everything'll work out.
- What's that?

...just a tough time right now,
you know.

So how are things at the hospital?
- Fine.

339

Hey, Dr. Schwartz retired last month.
- No kidding.

340

He must've been pushing 90.
- Close, yeah.

[So, how'd you like The Lion King?]

342

Oh, I loved it, you sweet kid.
I wish you'd gone.

343

Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.
It's just work.

I wish I could remember him better.

348
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:56,118
He was just a big kid.
He wanted to play baseball forever.

349
00:25:56,222 --> 00:26:00,116
[And fighting fires, he loved that.]

- Shit. We got squatters inside.

449
00:33:18,814 --> 00:33:20,886
Help.

450
00:33:22,973 --> 00:33:25,945
Help me. My sister's...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

451
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:29,178
She's up there. She passed out.
- Where is your sister?

452
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:31,673
I tried to help her.
- Tell me. What floor?

453
00:33:31,773 --> 00:33:35,705
She's up there on the top floor.
I tried, I tried.

454
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:38,010
Please, help her. Please.
- Butch, take her.

455
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:41,595
Come on, follow me.
Anybody else up there?

456
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:54,805
Ryan, get her medical treatment.

457
00:34:05,373 --> 00:34:09,368
Gimme my gear.
[- You have fire in the top floor.]

458
00:34:10,269 --> 00:34:12,904
Yeah, these are good.
Hey, Sull.

459
00:34:13,853 --> 00:34:19,156
Hey, here he is. How you feelin'?
- What can I tell you?

460
00:34:19,261 --> 00:34:22,109
Here you go.
- Thanks. Better.

461
00:34:29,277 --> 00:34:32,507
No visible fire first or second floor.

462
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:38,661
Watch your step, Proby.
This floor's rotten.

463
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:45,210
[Fire on the third floor.]
[We need a line. We're goin' up.]

464
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:47,350
We got two lines comin'.

465
00:35:11,998 --> 00:35:14,329
Back out, kid. Wait for the line.
- To hell with the line.

466
00:35:14,429 --> 00:35:19,019
I'll find another way up.
- No, you can't help me here.

467
00:35:46,621 --> 00:35:47,993
So you doin' okay, John?

468
00:35:48,093 --> 00:35:51,442
You know, tough day, you know?

469
00:35:56,413 --> 00:35:58,105
Hey, here's to your dad, huh?

470
00:35:58,205 --> 00:35:59,769
Thirty years today.

471
00:35:59,869 --> 00:36:01,529
To your dad.

472
00:36:01,629 --> 00:36:03,629
To my dad.

473
00:36:08,734 --> 00:36:12,304
We're pullin' everyone outta the building.

474
00:36:18,461 --> 00:36:21,370
[Get that ladder on the top floor.]
[It's cooking up here.]

475
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:24,858
[So after that Halloween thing]
[with the fire truck... You remember?]

476
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:27,385
Yeah, I remember riding
with Butch and your dad...

477
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,337
...and the whole
neighborhood was watching.

478
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:32,412
I remember.
I wanted to go as a cop.

479
00:36:32,893 --> 00:36:35,162
[Yeah, so Jules makes your dad]
[buy you that...]

480
00:36:35,262 --> 00:36:38,586
...that cop kit for your birthday.
- Oh, I remember that.

481
00:36:38,686 --> 00:36:40,953
I was always the robber.
I was always being handcuffed.

482
00:36:41,053 --> 00:36:44,198
That's right.
I taught you to do that.

483
00:37:09,181 --> 00:37:11,221
10-45, I found the girl.

484
00:37:11,325 --> 00:37:14,725
[She's breathin'.]
- We're gettin' 'em out.

485
00:37:24,413 --> 00:37:29,367
Hang on.
What the hell is goin' on?

486
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:33,145
Gino, what's the matter?
- The gear box, it's cracked.

487
00:37:33,245 --> 00:37:38,175
Frank, the ladder's jammed.
You gotta find another way out.

488
00:37:39,261 --> 00:37:41,261
[Frank, can you hear me?]

489
00:37:53,821 --> 00:37:57,210
It worked out okay, though.
You're a better cop than a fireman.

490
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:00,825
No doubt about it.
- Worked out good for me too.

491
00:38:00,925 --> 00:38:03,449
I'm glad I didn't have to spend
ten years as his hose man.

492
00:38:03,549 --> 00:38:06,865
Yeah, I bet you are.

493
00:38:10,973 --> 00:38:15,138
[The Buxton fire.]
[If you'd just gone the other way.]

494
00:38:37,245 --> 00:38:39,065
Frank, we're losin' the building.

495
00:38:39,165 --> 00:38:41,304
I know.

496
00:39:46,493 --> 00:39:49,177
Hey, hey, this is not a toy.

497
00:40:01,085 --> 00:40:03,550
Wave to your ma.
- Look at us.

498
00:40:18,013 --> 00:40:20,818
You're gonna be some ball player.

499
00:40:34,589 --> 00:40:37,753
Whoa. John, are you all right?
- John, John.

500
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:40,089
I'm sorry.
- What is it?

501
00:40:40,189 --> 00:40:44,354
Is everything okay?
- Yeah, can you bring a towel?

502
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:03,993
[Satch, my father didn't die in a fire, right?]
[

503
00:41:04,093 --> 00:41:07,323
Gordo, my father didn't die in a fire.

504
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:15,694
No. What are you talking about?
He had cancer.

505
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:22,329
[Cancer because of his cigarettes, right?]
[The cigarettes?]

506
00:41:22,429 --> 00:41:25,234
Yeah. Lung cancer. Ten years ago.

507
00:41:35,261 --> 00:41:36,921
Little Chief.

508
00:41:37,021 --> 00:41:41,561
[Gordo, I ain't dreamin' here.]
[I talked to him. It was real.]

509
00:41:41,661 --> 00:41:43,321
Little Chief.

510
00:41:43,421 --> 00:41:47,673
[John, what are you talkin' about?]
- It was the ham radio.

511
00:41:47,773 --> 00:41:50,555
That's how come he didn't die.

512
00:41:50,653 --> 00:41:53,019
Little Chief.

513
00:41:59,805 --> 00:42:02,355
That's how come he didn't die.

514
00:42:03,293 --> 00:42:07,384
John. John Sullivan,
are you there?

515
00:42:07,485 --> 00:42:09,485
Come on, answer me.

516
00:42:12,381 --> 00:42:15,861
Chief. Chief, are you there?

517
00:42:15,965 --> 00:42:18,168
I'm right here, Daddy.

518
00:42:19,485 --> 00:42:21,485
Come here.

519
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:24,333
Come on.

520
00:42:27,677 --> 00:42:30,066
Where's Elvis?
- Sleepin'.

521
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:32,473
Sleepin'. Why aren't you sleepin'?
- You woke me up.

522
00:42:32,573 --> 00:42:34,573
I did?

523
00:42:37,405 --> 00:42:41,017
Hey, I got an idea.
- What's that?

524
00:42:44,285 --> 00:42:46,285
All right, Chief.

525
00:42:47,741 --> 00:42:50,041
What do you say
we tame this bronco, huh?

526
00:42:50,141 --> 00:42:52,246
I'm scared.
- I know.

527
00:42:52,349 --> 00:42:54,356
And you know what?

528
00:42:54,461 --> 00:42:58,204
I'm gonna be right here with you.
Always.

529
00:42:58,301 --> 00:43:00,603
Daddy, I can't.

530
00:43:00,701 --> 00:43:03,865
Well, we can.
We can do it together.

531
00:43:03,964 --> 00:43:07,289
You and me, spirit and guts.
What do you say?

532
00:43:07,389 --> 00:43:09,599
Okay.
- All right, come on.

533
00:43:11,229 --> 00:43:16,569
Now you just take your time. I'm not
gonna let go until you say it's okay.

534
00:43:16,669 --> 00:43:19,474
Okay.
- All right? Start pedaling.

535
00:43:20,284 --> 00:43:22,673
That's it. Get your balance.

536
00:43:22,781 --> 00:43:25,305
Ready? Okay, I'm still here.
- Wait.

537
00:43:25,405 --> 00:43:26,841
Okay.
- All right.

538
00:43:26,941 --> 00:43:28,761
It's all you.
- Look at me.

539
00:43:28,861 --> 00:43:31,417
It's all you.
It's all you, Chief.

540
00:43:31,517 --> 00:43:34,297
Look at me, Dad.
- Hey, look at you. You're doin' it.

541
00:43:34,397 --> 00:43:36,441
I'm doin' it.
- You're doin' it.

542
00:43:36,541 --> 00:43:38,393
I'm doin' it.

543
00:43:38,493 --> 00:43:42,006
How's it feel?
- Good.

544
00:43:42,109 --> 00:43:43,832
This is great.
- Look at your balance.

545
00:43:43,932 --> 00:43:46,649
Like I'm on a flying trapeze.
- You're like a circus act.

546
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,825
This feels great.
- You're goin' around the world.

547
00:43:48,925 --> 00:43:52,665
It's like flying.
- Wait till your mother sees this, huh?

548
00:43:52,765 --> 00:43:56,335
Look at me.
- Let's wake up the world, huh?

549
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:40,333
Oh, my God.

550
00:45:21,021 --> 00:45:23,021
[Hello?]

551
00:45:25,501 --> 00:45:31,032
[Hello?]
- John? John Sullivan?

552
00:45:33,149 --> 00:45:35,149
It's me.

553
00:45:44,573 --> 00:45:47,061
[You're the voice of an angel.]

554
00:45:47,164 --> 00:45:52,185
[Reached right outta heaven]
[and you pulled my butt outta the fire.]

555
00:45:52,285 --> 00:45:56,505
Tell me I'm not dreamin' here.
Tell me it's really you.

556
00:45:56,605 --> 00:46:01,242
[It's me, John.]
[This ain't no dream.]

557
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:03,673
[But how could it be?]
- I don't know. I don't know...

558
00:46:03,773 --> 00:46:07,032
...but we gotta be talkin' off
the mother sunspot of all time.

559
00:46:07,132 --> 00:46:09,132
[Yeah, I'd say so.]

560
00:46:12,573 --> 00:46:14,573
You okay, Chief?

561
00:46:15,101 --> 00:46:17,589
Yeah, I'm fine.

562
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:19,692
[You sure?]

563
00:46:24,029 --> 00:46:26,363
It's tough to explain.

564
00:46:26,461 --> 00:46:31,032
I mean, I got all these new memories,
but I don't know what to believe.

565
00:46:31,132 --> 00:46:33,132
What do you mean?

566
00:46:33,148 --> 00:46:36,153
['Cause I still remember what it was like]
[when you died in the fire.]

567
00:46:36,253 --> 00:46:38,253
[But I'm the only one.]

568
00:46:38,845 --> 00:46:42,200
I don't understand what you're talkin' about.

569
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,537
I remember both at the same time.

570
00:46:44,637 --> 00:46:48,985
It... It's like wakin' up from a dream,
and you're not sure what's real.

571
00:46:49,085 --> 00:46:52,504
I remember you bein' here,
but I also remember when you weren't.

572
00:46:52,604 --> 00:46:55,900
Oh, I'm sorry, John.

573
00:46:55,997 --> 00:46:59,449
I'm sorry. I never thought that...
[- Well, you gotta think about that.]

574
00:46:59,549 --> 00:47:03,481
And you gotta be more careful,
'cause I can't lose you again.

575
00:47:03,581 --> 00:47:05,581
Not like that.

576
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:09,721
You won't, John, you won't.

577
00:47:09,821 --> 00:47:12,345
I swear to God, no matter what,
not like that.

578
00:47:12,445 --> 00:47:14,485
You got it? You hear me?

579
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:18,394
[You hear me, Chief?]
- I hear you.

580
00:47:23,101 --> 00:47:25,435
So how old are you?

581
00:47:27,453 --> 00:47:31,163
I'm 36.
[- Thirty-six?]

582
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:34,162
Well, you're all grown up.

583
00:47:34,269 --> 00:47:36,441
You gotta be married and everything.

584
00:47:36,541 --> 00:47:39,388
[No, I'm not married.]

585
00:47:39,484 --> 00:47:41,881
Why? What are you,
too busy playin' ball?

586
00:47:41,981 --> 00:47:46,869
[No, uh, it didn't work out.]
[I gave it up.]

587
00:47:46,972 --> 00:47:48,313
What happened?

588
00:47:48,413 --> 00:47:51,609
I just blew my arm out my senior year...

589
00:47:51,709 --> 00:47:54,262
...and didn't have a shot.

590
00:47:54,365 --> 00:47:58,617
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Johnny.
I know that had to hurt.

591
00:47:58,717 --> 00:48:01,400
[Yeah, thanks.]

592
00:48:02,397 --> 00:48:06,902
So, what'd you wind up doing?
You join the department?

593
00:48:07,261 --> 00:48:11,385
Actually, I went the other way.
I'm a cop.

594
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:14,712
You're third-generation firefighter.

595
00:48:14,812 --> 00:48:17,177
Come on, I thought you were gonna
grow outta that cop phase.

596
00:48:17,277 --> 00:48:19,321
[Well, you got Satch to thank for that one.]
[

597
00:48:19,421 --> 00:48:22,584
[You gotta be kiddin' me, huh?]
[Satch?]

598
00:48:22,684 --> 00:48:27,784
[Well, he always was crazy about you]
[ever since you were born.]

599
00:48:30,012 --> 00:48:34,290
You're still my Little Chief.
Right?

600
00:48:35,293 --> 00:48:37,293
[Right?]

601
00:48:38,237 --> 00:48:42,492
Yeah, I'm tryin' to be.
I'm tryin'.

602
00:48:45,692 --> 00:48:47,512
Well, tell me about yourself.

603
00:48:47,612 --> 00:48:50,515
[Tell me about your life.]

604
00:48:50,621 --> 00:48:55,029
I mean, where do I start,
you know?

605
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:58,329
[Mustang?]
[I don't own a Mustang.]

606
00:48:58,429 --> 00:49:00,888
Well, you will.
And you loved it.

607
00:49:00,988 --> 00:49:02,552
Fire-engine red.
[- Yeah?]

608
00:49:02,652 --> 00:49:04,184
Four on the floor.
[- Seventy home runs?]

609
00:49:04,284 --> 00:49:06,104
[That's a record that'll never be broken.]
[

610
00:49:06,204 --> 00:49:09,272
I wouldn't be too sure.
The other guy hit 66.

611
00:49:09,372 --> 00:49:12,824
Really? You mean, like those
big field radios you use in the army?

612
00:49:12,924 --> 00:49:15,704
[No, much smaller.]
[Works off a satellite or something.]

613
00:49:15,804 --> 00:49:17,529
You carry it around in your pocket.

614
00:49:17,629 --> 00:49:20,729
Hey, what about Apollo?
How'd it all work out?

615
00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:23,193
It was a great Series, Pop.
Amazing.

616
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:26,041
[So we win, right?]
- Hold your horses. I'm gettin' there.

617
00:49:26,141 --> 00:49:29,688
[Game three. Agee came through,]
[homered off Palmer in the second.]

618
00:49:29,788 --> 00:49:32,153
I knew it. I knew Agee
was gonna have a great Series.

619
00:49:32,253 --> 00:49:36,216
[Forget about Agee. Wait until you hear]
[what happened to Cleon Jones.]

620
00:49:36,316 --> 00:49:38,361
You sound like your mother.
[- Nah, I'm serious.]

621
00:49:38,461 --> 00:49:41,464
Oh, come on. Your grandfather...
he smoked, what, two packs a day.

622
00:49:41,564 --> 00:49:44,029
He's still kickin'.
[- Not you.]

623
00:49:44,029 --> 00:49:46,834
It's gonna get the better of you.

624
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,224
Okay?

625
00:49:51,324 --> 00:49:55,602
[Well, I just knew.]
[She melted my heart.]

626
00:49:55,708 --> 00:50:00,629
[That was it.]
[You got anybody?]

627
00:50:00,733 --> 00:50:03,602
Yeah, kinda.

628
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:08,859
There's somethin' I gotta work out, but...

629
00:50:08,956 --> 00:50:10,956
...she's worth it.

630
00:50:13,789 --> 00:50:16,888
No, you, um, go ahead.

631
00:50:16,988 --> 00:50:20,785
You, uh, get some rest.
I'm... I'm tired too.

632
00:50:22,013 --> 00:50:25,336
I almost don't wanna click off here like...

633
00:50:25,436 --> 00:50:28,156
...maybe we won't get this back.

634
00:50:28,412 --> 00:50:30,779
We will.
- Okay.

635
00:50:33,212 --> 00:50:35,212
I'll be here tomorrow.

636
00:50:36,829 --> 00:50:38,829
I know.

637
00:50:49,884 --> 00:50:52,819
I love you, son.

638
00:50:55,517 --> 00:50:57,517
I...

639
00:50:58,845 --> 00:51:01,212
I love you, too, Dad.

640
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,308
I've...

641
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,265
I've missed you so much.

642
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:30,865
[Hi, this is Julia Sullivan.]
[Please leave a message after the tone.]

643
00:51:31,741 --> 00:51:33,781
Hey, Ma, it's me.

644
00:51:36,541 --> 00:51:38,908
Just call me.
We gotta talk.

645
00:52:05,149 --> 00:52:07,614
Take over for me?
- All right.

646
00:52:09,341 --> 00:52:12,184
Frank, what's going on?
- Nothin'. Just wanted to see you.

647
00:52:12,284 --> 00:52:14,284
Yeah?

648
00:52:15,484 --> 00:52:19,480
I'm not goin' anywhere, Jules.
Not for the rest of your life.

649
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:22,330
Yeah?
- Yeah.

650
00:52:22,429 --> 00:52:24,249
I got a bad feeling today.
I was worried.

651
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:28,429
Hmm? Look at me. Not a scratch.
- Where's Johnny?

652
00:52:29,052 --> 00:52:30,872
He's at Gordo's.
I tucked him in.

653
00:52:30,972 --> 00:52:34,769
You give him his drops?
- One in each ear.

654
00:52:34,876 --> 00:52:36,248
What would you do without me?

655
00:52:36,348 --> 00:52:40,683
Probably marry some rich doctor.
Never have to work.

656
00:52:40,732 --> 00:52:44,642
Oh, my God. What is he doin'?
Frank, I gotta...

657
00:52:45,084 --> 00:52:46,712
Excuse me, Doctor.
Is that benazepril?

658
00:52:46,812 --> 00:52:49,401
I gave this patient 50 mils of Benadryl
on admittance. Mix them, and he's dead.

659
00:52:49,501 --> 00:52:53,921
Why wasn't I made aware of this?
- It's in his chart.

660
00:55:06,812 --> 00:55:08,885
Hello, Ma?
[- Noah's Deli.]

661
00:55:08,988 --> 00:55:10,988
I'm sorry.

662
00:55:19,196 --> 00:55:21,367
[This is Noah's Deli.]

663
00:55:38,044 --> 00:55:41,786
Sam, I gotta talk to you.
- Excuse me?

664
00:55:41,884 --> 00:55:45,048
Look, I'm sorry,
but I gotta talk to you.

665
00:55:45,148 --> 00:55:47,188
How do you know my name?

666
00:55:47,548 --> 00:55:50,396
Who are you?
- Who am I?

667
00:55:50,493 --> 00:55:52,664
Look, I don't know you.

668
00:55:52,765 --> 00:55:57,208
You don't know me?
What do you mean, you don't know me?

669
00:55:57,308 --> 00:56:00,408
Wait. I do know you.
You're Linda and Gordo's friend.

670
00:56:00,508 --> 00:56:04,418
The neighbor, the cop.
What are you doin' here?

671
00:56:11,036 --> 00:56:13,176
I shouldn't have come here.

672
00:56:13,276 --> 00:56:17,335
I didn't mean to upset you.
I'm sorry.

673
00:56:22,429 --> 00:56:24,724
Yeah, I'll take care of it.

674
00:56:50,236 --> 00:56:52,789
What?
- Another rough night?

675
00:56:52,892 --> 00:56:56,275
Is that it?
- Yeah, that's it.

676
00:56:56,381 --> 00:56:58,676
Do not disrespect me, John.

677
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:03,320
Disrespect yourself all you want to,
but not me or anybody else here.

678
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,420
Got that?

679
00:57:13,372 --> 00:57:15,512
We got the preliminary forensics
on the skeleton.

680
00:57:15,612 --> 00:57:17,612
Take a look at this.

681
00:57:26,204 --> 00:57:28,204
Bad memories.

682
00:57:29,564 --> 00:57:33,688
Can you imagine the odds of digging
up a Nightingale murder?

683
00:57:33,788 --> 00:57:36,603
She makes ten.
- Ten?

684
00:57:36,732 --> 00:57:41,816
No. I remember this case.
It was three. He killed three women.

685
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:46,676
What are you talkin'?
You know better than anybody, John.

686
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:53,335
You looked through these files
a thousand times.

687
00:58:02,097 --> 00:58:04,431
No.

688
00:58:28,577 --> 00:58:30,577
Dad? You there?

689
00:58:31,713 --> 00:58:33,713
Can you hear me?

690
00:58:34,337 --> 00:58:36,890
Dad, I need you to be there.

691
00:58:36,993 --> 00:58:39,197
Yeah, Chief, I'm comin'.

692
00:58:39,297 --> 00:58:42,697
Listen, there's something I need to t...

693
00:58:44,193 --> 00:58:46,193
Right here.

694
00:58:47,873 --> 00:58:49,405
Chief?

695
00:58:49,505 --> 00:58:51,868
Something happened.
Something pretty bad.

696
00:58:51,968 --> 00:58:54,077
What's the matter, Johnny?

697
00:58:54,177 --> 00:58:58,077
Mom. Something happened to her.
- Your mom. What?

698
00:58:58,177 --> 00:59:00,250
She's not here.

699
00:59:00,353 --> 00:59:03,243
What do you mean, she's not there?

700
00:59:05,249 --> 00:59:09,244
She died. But it's like
it just happened though.

701
00:59:09,889 --> 00:59:12,028
She died? Your mom just died?

702
00:59:12,128 --> 00:59:17,228
No, Dad. It happened a long time ago.
A long time ago for me.

703
00:59:17,793 --> 00:59:19,134
When?

704
00:59:19,234 --> 00:59:22,975
October 22, 1969.

705
00:59:24,577 --> 00:59:27,261
That's now, Johnny.
That's next week.

706
00:59:27,361 --> 00:59:30,230
How? You gotta tell me how.

707
00:59:31,265 --> 00:59:33,181
She was murdered.
- What are you talking about?

708
00:59:33,281 --> 00:59:35,741
Listen to me.
There was this case.

709
00:59:35,841 --> 00:59:38,973
A serial. They never caught him,
but he murdered three women.

710
00:59:39,073 --> 00:59:43,037
All nurses between '68 and '69.
They call him the Nightingale.

711
00:59:43,137 --> 00:59:46,493
The Nightingale? We've been watching it
on the news. I was worried about it.

712
00:59:46,593 --> 00:59:50,397
Dad, we did something.
Something to make it worse.

713
00:59:50,497 --> 00:59:53,180
I don't understand.

714
00:59:53,281 --> 00:59:55,741
He didn't just kill three women anymore.
He's killed ten.

715
00:59:55,841 --> 00:59:57,821
Something we did changed the past.

716
00:59:57,921 --> 01:00:00,797
But how come your mother...
- Just think about it.

717
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:03,933
Everything you did is different than if
you hadn't gotten out of that warehouse.

718
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:06,140
Now, what'd you do last night, Dad?

719
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:10,299
I talked to you.
I put you on the bike.

720
01:00:11,296 --> 01:00:15,038
I tucked you in at Gordo's. I went
to see your mother at the hospital.

721
01:00:15,138 --> 01:00:19,101
Oh, shit. That's it.
She wasn't supposed to be there.

722
01:00:19,201 --> 01:00:22,173
Butch went and got her because
that was the night of the fire.

723
01:00:22,273 --> 01:00:24,094
Something happened at that hospital?

724
01:00:24,194 --> 01:00:28,684
It could have been anywhere or time that
she wouldn't have been if you'd died.

725
01:00:28,784 --> 01:00:32,118
I have to take her away from here.

726
01:00:32,257 --> 01:00:34,461
He cannot hurt her if I take her.
- What about the others?

727
01:00:34,561 --> 01:00:37,876
What about the others?
- I'll warn them.

728
01:00:37,953 --> 01:00:39,869
They'll just think you're crazy.

729
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:43,325
I gotta do something. You don't
even know what this guy looks like.

730
01:00:43,425 --> 01:00:46,206
No, because... No, but...
- You don't know who he is.

731
01:00:46,306 --> 01:00:48,306
Wait a minute.

732
01:00:50,048 --> 01:00:52,382
Dad, I may not know who he is...

733
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:56,381
...but I know where he's gonna to be and
what he's gonna do before he gets there.

734
01:00:56,481 --> 01:00:59,037
Do I call the police?
They won't believe me.

735
01:00:59,137 --> 01:01:02,493
They will if they catch him in the act.
And you can make that happen.

736
01:01:02,593 --> 01:01:05,854
No, I don't know about...
I'm a firefighter.

737
01:01:05,954 --> 01:01:10,205
I'm a cop. This is what I do.
This is something we have to do.

738
01:01:10,305 --> 01:01:12,253
What if the ham stops working?
What if I can't reach you?

739
01:01:12,353 --> 01:01:13,757
Then get Mom out.

740
01:01:13,857 --> 01:01:17,469
But, Dad, those other women
were not supposed to die.

741
01:01:17,569 --> 01:01:19,390
If we don't try and stop this guy...

742
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:23,900
...we'll have to live with that
for the rest of our lives.

743
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,929
Okay. Tell me what to do.
- All right.

744
01:01:28,033 --> 01:01:30,493
The next victim is Carrie Reynolds.

745
01:01:30,593 --> 01:01:34,685
It happens tomorrow. Case file says
she left Roosevelt Hospital at 6:00.

746
01:01:34,785 --> 01:01:36,829
Showed up at Cozy's Bar around 6:30.

747
01:01:36,929 --> 01:01:39,646
She walked out of that bar around 7:30.

748
01:01:39,746 --> 01:01:43,612
And they found her dead in an alley
behind the bar at 8:00.

749
01:01:43,712 --> 01:01:47,261
Follow her. See if anybody's
watching her or hitting on her.

750
01:01:47,361 --> 01:01:51,900
I'm betting when she walks out of
that place, somebody'll go out with her.

751
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,870
When they do, you call the cops.

752
01:01:55,009 --> 01:01:57,021
Hi, Carrie.
- Hiya, Glen. How you doin'?

753
01:01:57,121 --> 01:01:59,121
Real good.

754
01:02:44,033 --> 01:02:47,295
From the girls, pal.
All of them.

755
01:02:54,048 --> 01:02:56,048
Thanks.

756
01:03:04,129 --> 01:03:06,747
Sit down.
- A fireman, huh?

757
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:09,916
Yeah, I'm not really...
- Ah, a married fireman.

758
01:03:10,016 --> 01:03:14,205
Yeah.
- What the hell. What do they call you?

759
01:03:14,305 --> 01:03:16,305
Frank.

760
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,037
7-4. Homicide.

761
01:03:23,137 --> 01:03:25,137
Yeah, it's me.

762
01:03:25,728 --> 01:03:27,728
You're kiddin'.

763
01:03:29,249 --> 01:03:32,118
Hold on. Spell that for me.

764
01:03:32,257 --> 01:03:35,355
Okay. Thanks, Mario.

765
01:03:37,633 --> 01:03:40,350
Our lucky break.
Mario ID'd the dental.

766
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:45,210
Her name's Mary Finelli.
Reported missing April 16, 1968.

767
01:03:45,601 --> 01:03:49,146
April 16?
That means she was the first.

768
01:03:49,249 --> 01:03:51,837
Which means he probably knew her.

769
01:03:51,937 --> 01:03:53,937
This case just got hot.

770
01:03:56,225 --> 01:03:59,710
She's gone.
Carrie Reynolds isn't in here.

771
01:04:02,017 --> 01:04:04,017
Who?

772
01:04:05,857 --> 01:04:07,857
He did it.

773
01:04:11,777 --> 01:04:13,788
Carrie Reynolds is alive and well, Dad.

774
01:04:13,888 --> 01:04:17,117
I'll be damned.
- Did you see him?

775
01:04:17,217 --> 01:04:20,192
Figure who he is?
- No, I messed up.

776
01:04:20,192 --> 01:04:22,749
I kept talking to her.
I was afraid to let her out of my sight.

777
01:04:22,849 --> 01:04:24,765
Whoever it was,
he must've backed off.

778
01:04:24,865 --> 01:04:27,901
That's okay. We're gonna get him.
This is gonna work.

779
01:04:28,001 --> 01:04:30,489
I hope so.

780
01:04:30,593 --> 01:04:33,213
What else you got?
- We caught a break.

781
01:04:33,313 --> 01:04:35,680
Found his first victim.

782
01:04:35,808 --> 01:04:37,662
Her name is Mary Finelli.

783
01:04:37,762 --> 01:04:39,762
Hang on a sec, John.

784
01:04:39,777 --> 01:04:43,901
Jules, there's somebody
I want you to talk to, okay?

785
01:04:44,001 --> 01:04:46,428
Remember I told you about this guy John?

786
01:04:46,528 --> 01:04:48,509
I want you to say hello to him.

787
01:04:48,609 --> 01:04:52,700
John, say hello to my wife, Julia.

788
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,692
Hi, John.

789
01:04:57,792 --> 01:04:59,868
Frank tells me you're a cop.

790
01:04:59,968 --> 01:05:01,597
Yeah, that's right.

791
01:05:01,697 --> 01:05:05,406
My six-year-old keeps telling us
he wants to be a policeman...

792
01:05:05,506 --> 01:05:08,348
...right after he retires from the majors.

793
01:05:08,448 --> 01:05:11,036
We bought him a badge and whistle
for his birthday.

794
01:05:11,136 --> 01:05:13,918
I remember.
I used to play cops and robbers...

795
01:05:14,018 --> 01:05:17,629
...but you... my mom wouldn't let me
have a toy gun.

796
01:05:17,729 --> 01:05:20,636
Sounds like your mom and I
would get along.

797
01:05:20,736 --> 01:05:24,029
Yeah, she's pretty special.
I'm real proud of her.

798
01:05:24,129 --> 01:05:28,209
Bet she's proud of you, too,
being a cop and all.

799
01:05:28,448 --> 01:05:33,020
I hope so. I hope she knows
how much I love her.

800
01:05:33,121 --> 01:05:37,437
Oh, she knows. Moms always know
how much their kids love them.

801
01:05:37,537 --> 01:05:42,467
Even if they don't tell them
all the time like they should.

802
01:05:43,168 --> 01:05:46,556
Well, I gotta go.
It was good talking to you, John.

803
01:05:46,656 --> 01:05:47,837
Yeah, you too.

804
01:05:47,937 --> 01:05:50,780
I wanna talk on Daddy's radio.
- Okay, Chief, go ahead.

805
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:55,470
Sweetheart, say good night to John.
- Good night, John.

806
01:05:56,577 --> 01:05:58,617
Good night there, Chief.

807
01:05:59,969 --> 01:06:01,969
Okay, guys. Bedtime.

808
01:06:02,048 --> 01:06:04,028
No, I wanna talk on the radio, too.

809
01:06:04,128 --> 01:06:08,060
All right, Gordo, come here.
- Gordo, two minutes, then bedtime.

810
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,975
Sit right there.
Press there.

811
01:06:12,928 --> 01:06:14,750
This is the space cowboy.

812
01:06:14,850 --> 01:06:18,684
I'm an intergalactic traveler
from the federation planet Earth.

813
01:06:18,784 --> 01:06:22,184
Gordo?
- How do you know my name, mister?

814
01:06:25,152 --> 01:06:26,973
Listen, Gordo...

815
01:06:27,073 --> 01:06:29,021
...my name is Santa Claus.

816
01:06:29,121 --> 01:06:33,788
And I'm going to give you the
biggest Christmas present you ever had.

817
01:06:33,888 --> 01:06:35,900
I better give you my address then.

818
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,069
No, don't worry about it.
Now, this is important.

819
01:06:39,169 --> 01:06:43,589
Something you got to remember
for a long time. Yahoo.

820
01:06:43,904 --> 01:06:45,085
What's that?

821
01:06:45,185 --> 01:06:47,357
It's a magic word. It's like...

822
01:06:47,457 --> 01:06:52,891
It's like abracadabra, but even better.
Try it out, kid. Yahoo.

823
01:06:53,633 --> 01:06:56,060
Yahoo.
- You got it, space cowboy.

824
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,108
Gordo, your two minutes are up.

825
01:06:58,208 --> 01:07:01,469
Now go upstairs and write it down.
- Okay, mister.

826
01:07:01,569 --> 01:07:03,609
I mean, Santa.
- Come on.

827
01:07:03,681 --> 01:07:07,708
Let's go. Stay there, John.
I'll be right back. Upstairs.

828
01:07:07,808 --> 01:07:11,965
Jules, got a live one down here
coming your way.

829
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:14,012
Yeah, Chief?

830
01:07:14,112 --> 01:07:16,381
You still there?

831
01:07:16,481 --> 01:07:19,742
What do we do now?
- Okay, Sissy Clark.

832
01:07:19,842 --> 01:07:23,452
423 Greenwich Street.
- Hang on, hang on. Go ahead.

833
01:07:23,552 --> 01:07:28,221
Sissy Clark, 423 Greenwich Street,
apartment 2E, tomorrow.

834
01:07:28,321 --> 01:07:30,492
Okay, 2E.
- Nurse.

835
01:07:30,592 --> 01:07:35,517
Moonlights as a cocktail waitress
at the Kaleidoscope on West 63rd.

836
01:07:35,617 --> 01:07:38,105
Left work at 2 a. m...

837
01:07:38,241 --> 01:07:42,661
...was killed in her apartment
between 2:15 and 5:00.

838
01:07:43,104 --> 01:07:44,540
Okay, I got it.

839
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:48,220
Dad, I don't know how long
this thing is gonna keep workin'.

840
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:52,570
Or if we'll be able to talk again.
Just be careful.

841
01:08:26,016 --> 01:08:28,991
I'm happy you found her, Detective.

842
01:08:29,248 --> 01:08:33,591
It makes it easier now,
to know for sure.

843
01:08:33,728 --> 01:08:36,117
You know.

844
01:08:37,536 --> 01:08:40,001
Can I keep these for a while?

845
01:08:42,016 --> 01:08:45,529
Okay, just let me walk you through it.

846
01:08:45,664 --> 01:08:47,664
I'm all ears.

847
01:08:48,512 --> 01:08:52,677
Three guys show up
in both the yearbook and diary.

848
01:08:53,088 --> 01:08:56,148
First guy passed away ten years ago.

849
01:08:57,024 --> 01:08:59,319
Second guy died in Vietnam.

850
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,492
And the third one is Daryl Simpson.

851
01:09:02,592 --> 01:09:06,138
So I ran him through BCI.
Got a hit.

852
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:10,620
Busted for sexual assault eight days
after the last Nightingale murder.

853
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,380
March 22, 1970.

854
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:15,453
So the murders stopped because
he was off the street...

855
01:09:15,553 --> 01:09:19,964
...and by the time he got paroled he had
smartened up enough to control himself?

856
01:09:20,064 --> 01:09:22,108
That's not the first time that's been true.

857
01:09:22,208 --> 01:09:26,458
I got a feeling about this guy.
This is him, Satch.

858
01:09:46,912 --> 01:09:50,992
Can I get you another one?
- No thanks, I'm good.

859
01:09:53,408 --> 01:09:54,749
Anything else?

860
01:09:54,849 --> 01:09:58,045
Sexual assault, Daryl.
Five years.

861
01:09:58,145 --> 01:10:01,886
But you got lucky, right?
You got away with something else.

862
01:10:01,986 --> 01:10:04,188
Something you figured
nobody knows about.

863
01:10:04,288 --> 01:10:06,109
What I know is what I told you.

864
01:10:06,209 --> 01:10:08,989
Let me tell you what I know.
You went to Saint Ambrose with Mary.

865
01:10:09,089 --> 01:10:12,572
You lived five blocks from her.
You liked her, but she ain't interested.

866
01:10:12,672 --> 01:10:15,519
That must've hurt, huh?
- So what?

867
01:10:15,648 --> 01:10:18,793
So, what'd you do about it?
- Nothing.

868
01:10:26,048 --> 01:10:28,048
Spare a smoke?

869
01:10:28,065 --> 01:10:29,309
Yeah.

870
01:10:29,409 --> 01:10:31,896
Here, I'm trying to quit.

871
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:37,021
Oh, my God.

872
01:10:37,121 --> 01:10:39,259
What is this?

873
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,214
Jesus. Jesus.

874
01:10:41,314 --> 01:10:44,508
Get that away from me.
- Sandra Moore. Patty Ryan.

875
01:10:44,608 --> 01:10:47,357
Mary Finelli. These names
mean anything to you?

876
01:10:47,457 --> 01:10:49,693
Julia Sullivan.
Does she mean anything?

877
01:10:49,793 --> 01:10:52,662
Well, she means something to me.

878
01:11:03,744 --> 01:11:06,876
See ya, fireman.
Don't talk so much next time.

879
01:11:06,976 --> 01:11:09,372
Will you run my tips while I go change?

880
01:11:09,472 --> 01:11:11,472
Thanks.

881
01:11:27,937 --> 01:11:30,108
You know, Daryl...

882
01:11:30,209 --> 01:11:35,036
...sometimes, despite all the training
we cops go through...

883
01:11:35,136 --> 01:11:38,460
...despite all that we are taught
about right and wrong...

884
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:42,204
...despite all that we would like
to honor in ourselves...

885
01:11:42,304 --> 01:11:44,684
...we can come to a place...

886
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:47,670
...where we don't give a damn.

887
01:11:48,064 --> 01:11:50,064
Know what I mean?

888
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:54,588
You'll tell me everything
I need to know now.

889
01:11:55,073 --> 01:11:56,700
You got a minute?

890
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,767
Yeah, sure.

891
01:12:06,848 --> 01:12:08,604
He ain't the guy, John.

892
01:12:08,704 --> 01:12:12,764
Because he didn't want to look at the
photos? Not everyone fits the profile.

893
01:12:12,864 --> 01:12:18,134
If he was gonna give up something,
he would've done it already.

894
01:12:28,128 --> 01:12:29,660
You following me?

895
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,760
You following me?

896
01:12:34,048 --> 01:12:36,862
I asked you a question, asshole.

897
01:12:36,962 --> 01:12:38,962
Mary Finelli.

898
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:09,148
Whoa, dude.
What happened to him?

899
01:13:09,248 --> 01:13:14,556
It was a bad trip, man. A little time
kissing the porcelain, he'll be fine.

900
01:13:14,656 --> 01:13:18,396
I understand that.
- All right, come on, pal.

901
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:09,557
Open up.
Miss Clark. Open the door.

902
01:14:09,696 --> 01:14:12,331
It's the police. Open the door.

903
01:14:12,576 --> 01:14:14,909
It's okay, ma'am. Go back inside.
It's the police.

904
01:14:15,009 --> 01:14:19,174
Are you in there? Open up.
I know you're in there.

905
01:14:20,416 --> 01:14:23,901
Sissy Clark. Open the door.
Open the door.

906
01:15:09,632 --> 01:15:12,120
He killed her.

907
01:15:12,416 --> 01:15:14,396
I couldn't do a damn thing to stop it.

908
01:15:14,496 --> 01:15:17,431
It's not your fault.
- Yes, it is.

909
01:15:17,568 --> 01:15:19,740
We changed everything, Johnny.

910
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:23,517
It's like we cheated.
- Dad, we can't go back.

911
01:15:23,617 --> 01:15:25,564
'Cause you didn't die in that fire.

912
01:15:25,664 --> 01:15:27,998
No matter what you do,
nothing is going to change it.

913
01:15:28,098 --> 01:15:31,196
So all we can do is deal with this
and try to make it right.

914
01:15:31,296 --> 01:15:34,876
I'm not a cop. I'm not fooling anyone.
- I know, but we can.

915
01:15:34,976 --> 01:15:38,971
We can do it together.
Remember spirit and guts?

916
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:42,625
He's got my driver's license.

917
01:15:42,752 --> 01:15:43,836
What?

918
01:15:43,936 --> 01:15:46,939
He took my driver's license.
He knows where we live.

919
01:15:47,039 --> 01:15:49,789
He took your...
He took your wallet?

920
01:15:49,889 --> 01:15:52,347
Well, he tossed the wallet,
but he kept the license.

921
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:54,940
He touched your wallet? Where is it?
- In my pocket.

922
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,020
We got him, Dad. You got him.
- What?

923
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:00,956
You got his prints. Listen,
you gotta get me that wallet.

924
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:04,860
How the hell am I supposed to do that?
- As carefully as possible.

925
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,900
Take your wallet out by the corners.
- What are you talking about?

926
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,979
Dad, just do it.
- All right.

927
01:16:10,079 --> 01:16:13,625
All right. Right. Okay.
I got it.

928
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,260
All right, listen.

929
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:17,372
I want you to wrap it up.

930
01:16:17,472 --> 01:16:20,988
Put it in one of them plastic bags
you keep the extra transistors in.

931
01:16:21,088 --> 01:16:22,780
I see where you're going.

932
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:25,852
Beautiful. Now, I want you
to hide it somewhere.

933
01:16:25,952 --> 01:16:30,141
Somewhere where nobody's
gonna find it for the next 30 years.

934
01:16:30,241 --> 01:16:31,932
I think maybe...
- Where?

935
01:16:32,032 --> 01:16:34,333
The window seat in the dining room.

936
01:16:34,433 --> 01:16:37,115
There's a loose board on the left,
on the bottom.

937
01:16:37,215 --> 01:16:39,215
Perfect. Beautiful.

938
01:16:54,912 --> 01:16:56,188
It's in.

939
01:16:56,288 --> 01:16:58,524
Great. Okay, I'm after it.

940
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:13,945
We're in business.
Now just sit tight and don't worry.

941
01:17:43,008 --> 01:17:45,008
And the winner is...

942
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:49,149
Oh, man. It's a cop.

943
01:17:49,249 --> 01:17:51,249
What the hell?

944
01:17:58,912 --> 01:18:00,920
Son of a bitch.

945
01:18:14,112 --> 01:18:17,461
Hey, Mr. Shepard. How are you?

946
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,901
Who's that?
Oh, hi, Detective.

947
01:18:20,001 --> 01:18:23,067
I came by to wrap things up over there.
Thought I'd say hello.

948
01:18:23,167 --> 01:18:26,037
I'm glad you did.
Come on in.

949
01:18:26,176 --> 01:18:28,176
Thank you.

950
01:18:31,136 --> 01:18:33,771
Buy you a cup of coffee?
- Sure.

951
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:37,371
Black? Sugar? Milk?
- Oh, you know. It's all good.

952
01:18:37,471 --> 01:18:39,471
You'll get black.

953
01:18:44,032 --> 01:18:46,032
Fresh pot.

954
01:18:46,975 --> 01:18:49,052
You know Jack?
- Not really.

955
01:18:49,152 --> 01:18:51,005
He's still on the job?

956
01:18:51,105 --> 01:18:55,015
He does a little P.I.,
but he's mostly retired.

957
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:58,220
Living off his pension, huh?

958
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:02,974
Jack got caught up
in them Knapp hearings.

959
01:19:03,104 --> 01:19:06,588
Set up by some dirty cops
who needed a fall guy.

960
01:19:06,688 --> 01:19:09,116
Hurt him bad.
Would've broke his mother's heart.

961
01:19:09,216 --> 01:19:11,517
Is she around?
- Who?

962
01:19:11,617 --> 01:19:15,642
Your wife.
- No. She passed on a long time ago.

963
01:19:17,984 --> 01:19:19,984
Long time ago.

964
01:19:25,632 --> 01:19:29,177
I'm sorry.
- Oh, that's okay.

965
01:19:34,975 --> 01:19:37,277
Can I ask you how she died?

966
01:19:42,688 --> 01:19:44,761
Well, she...

967
01:19:46,368 --> 01:19:48,368
She was murdered.

968
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:52,255
An ugly one, to tell you the truth.

969
01:19:52,511 --> 01:19:57,611
Mother of a cop, and they never found
the bastard who did it.

970
01:20:29,599 --> 01:20:31,599
You on the job?

971
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:37,072
A long time ago.

972
01:20:37,919 --> 01:20:40,347
Do I know you?
- I look familiar?

973
01:20:40,447 --> 01:20:43,579
What house you work?
- The 7-4. Homicide.

974
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:45,752
Mmm, a hotshot.

975
01:20:45,888 --> 01:20:49,499
No, just working the job.
- Yeah, I hear that, pal.

976
01:20:49,599 --> 01:20:53,851
As a matter of fact, I caught a case
that goes back to your day.

977
01:20:53,951 --> 01:20:56,586
One of the Nightingale murders.

978
01:20:56,736 --> 01:20:59,228
No kidding?
- No. Missing teenager.

979
01:20:59,328 --> 01:21:03,387
Disappeared back in '68.
We found her bones last week...

980
01:21:03,487 --> 01:21:06,619
...buried behind some old diner
out by Dyckman Street.

981
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:09,609
Mary Finelli.
Talk about dumb luck.

982
01:21:09,696 --> 01:21:14,203
The odds of finding that girl 30 years
later and of hitting a dental...

983
01:21:14,303 --> 01:21:15,996
Forget about it.

984
01:21:16,096 --> 01:21:18,268
The best part is,
she's the first victim.

985
01:21:18,368 --> 01:21:21,367
And she knew the killer, so...

986
01:21:21,504 --> 01:21:26,349
I'm betting those old bones
are gonna do a lot of talking.

987
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:30,748
But not for nothing.
The past is a funny thing.

988
01:21:30,848 --> 01:21:32,828
We all have skeletons in the closet.

989
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:35,579
You never know when they're going
to pop up and bite you in the ass.

990
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:37,687
Huh, Jack?

991
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,120
You changed your M.O.

992
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:47,451
If they knew your mom was a Nightingale,
they would've looked at the family.

993
01:21:47,551 --> 01:21:50,268
They would've looked at you.

994
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:56,629
And what are you lookin' at?

995
01:21:56,768 --> 01:21:59,321
Stealin' your life away.

996
01:21:59,456 --> 01:22:01,947
You went down 30 years ago, pal.

997
01:22:02,047 --> 01:22:04,342
You just don't know it yet.

998
01:22:29,056 --> 01:22:33,277
A cop? He's a cop? What the hell
am I supposed to do with that?

999
01:22:33,377 --> 01:22:35,420
Call the FBI. Use a pay phone.

1000
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:37,500
Don't give him your name, Dad.

1001
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:41,852
Say Shepard killed Finelli, Clark and
the others. That he's the Nightingale.

1002
01:22:41,952 --> 01:22:45,659
Say where Finelli's body's buried.
They'll connect him to her.

1003
01:22:45,759 --> 01:22:47,899
Frank here?
- They'll search his place.

1004
01:22:47,999 --> 01:22:50,971
They'll find some souvenirs. He always
took a piece of his victims' jewelry.

1005
01:22:51,071 --> 01:22:53,210
Satch.
- Hey, Frank.

1006
01:22:56,608 --> 01:23:00,059
What are you doing here? Are you off?
- We need to talk.

1007
01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:02,139
Dad?
- Hang on a sec, John.

1008
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:06,748
I'm in the middle of something important
here. Mind if we do this...

1009
01:23:06,848 --> 01:23:11,069
I'm sorry, Frank, but we need
to step outside right now.

1010
01:23:11,169 --> 01:23:12,251
What's happening?

1011
01:23:12,351 --> 01:23:16,028
John, Satch is here.

1012
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:18,876
He's with his partner.
- What's going on?

1013
01:23:18,976 --> 01:23:20,315
Hang on a sec.

1014
01:23:20,415 --> 01:23:24,188
What's your partner doing here?
- What happened to your eye?

1015
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:25,627
Banged it up.

1016
01:23:25,727 --> 01:23:27,387
Let's talk outside.

1017
01:23:27,487 --> 01:23:29,467
We need to do that.
- About what?

1018
01:23:29,567 --> 01:23:33,052
Let's go. Do us both a favor.
- All right.

1019
01:23:35,935 --> 01:23:38,060
Stay there. I'll be back.

1020
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:42,581
Be right back, all right?

1021
01:23:54,816 --> 01:23:57,876
So where were you last night, Frank?

1022
01:23:58,815 --> 01:24:01,535
Where do you think I was, Satch?

1023
01:24:02,175 --> 01:24:04,215
Same place I found this.

1024
01:24:05,728 --> 01:24:08,363
Under the body of a dead woman.

1025
01:24:11,295 --> 01:24:14,295
No, this isn't what you think.

1026
01:24:14,431 --> 01:24:16,667
This isn't what you think.
- I want to be wrong.

1027
01:24:16,767 --> 01:24:20,636
So let's take a ride down
to the precinct and talk about it.

1028
01:24:20,736 --> 01:24:24,572
Yeah, I need to talk to you, too.
- Come on, we'll take a ride.

1029
01:24:24,672 --> 01:24:27,100
All right. Let me tell my family
where I'm going.

1030
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,371
All right? Be right back.

1031
01:24:32,575 --> 01:24:34,870
It's all right.
Don't worry.

1032
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:42,939
Chief, you there?
- Yeah.

1033
01:24:43,039 --> 01:24:45,211
They found Sissy Clark.
They think that I did it.

1034
01:24:45,311 --> 01:24:47,897
Frank.
- Give me a second.

1035
01:24:48,031 --> 01:24:50,300
Don't do this.

1036
01:24:50,432 --> 01:24:53,051
What's going on?
- Uncle Satch, don't.

1037
01:24:53,151 --> 01:24:55,151
What's going on?

1038
01:25:24,415 --> 01:25:25,787
He's a cop.

1039
01:25:25,887 --> 01:25:28,309
A cop.

1040
01:25:30,175 --> 01:25:32,175
Jack Shepard.

1041
01:25:32,191 --> 01:25:34,396
He's a detective in the 15th precinct.

1042
01:25:34,496 --> 01:25:36,283
I swear, Satch.

1043
01:25:36,383 --> 01:25:40,731
And you got all this from the guy on
the radio, from your son in the future.

1044
01:25:40,831 --> 01:25:43,806
Yeah. As nuts as that sounds, yeah.

1045
01:25:48,031 --> 01:25:52,219
You've gotta listen to me, open up your
mind and try to understand what I say.

1046
01:25:52,319 --> 01:25:55,516
You got something going on
with this girl, that's one thing.

1047
01:25:55,616 --> 01:25:58,005
But you gotta tell me.

1048
01:25:59,839 --> 01:26:02,907
Are you listening to me?
You're in a world of shit.

1049
01:26:03,007 --> 01:26:06,107
An eyewitness puts you outside
the dead girl's apartment.

1050
01:26:06,207 --> 01:26:10,203
Your prints are all over the place,
not to mention the license.

1051
01:26:10,303 --> 01:26:12,763
Chuck is getting a search warrant
for your house.

1052
01:26:12,863 --> 01:26:16,311
What's he going to find, huh?
- Nothing.

1053
01:26:16,447 --> 01:26:20,017
Give me something,
something I can believe.

1054
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:26,646
It's number five for Dave McNally.

1055
01:26:26,783 --> 01:26:29,435
Two Mets are out in the fifth inning.

1056
01:26:29,535 --> 01:26:31,739
What if I can prove it to you?

1057
01:26:31,839 --> 01:26:33,847
How's that?

1058
01:26:33,951 --> 01:26:38,139
World Series. Where are they
right now? What? Fifth inning?

1059
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:40,476
What if I were to tell you...

1060
01:26:40,576 --> 01:26:43,035
...that in the bottom of the sixth inning...

1061
01:26:43,135 --> 01:26:45,723
...the Mets are gonna be down three-zip?

1062
01:26:45,823 --> 01:26:47,899
Cleon Jones is gonna come to bat.

1063
01:26:47,999 --> 01:26:49,819
He's going to get hit...

1064
01:26:49,919 --> 01:26:53,236
...in the foot by a wild pitch.

1065
01:26:53,343 --> 01:26:55,771
It's gonna leave a shoe polish mark
on the ball.

1066
01:26:55,871 --> 01:26:58,140
Hear me out.
Hear me out, all right?

1067
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:01,370
He goes to first.
Clendenon comes up.

1068
01:27:01,471 --> 01:27:04,285
He's gonna hit a two-two pitch
into the left field bleachers.

1069
01:27:04,385 --> 01:27:05,979
This is insane.

1070
01:27:06,079 --> 01:27:09,179
In the bottom of the seventh,
Weis is gonna hit a solo home run...

1071
01:27:09,279 --> 01:27:11,963
...and Jones and Swoboda
are gonna score in the eighth.

1072
01:27:12,063 --> 01:27:14,075
The Mets are gonna win that game,
five to three.

1073
01:27:14,175 --> 01:27:16,251
Go watch that game.
If it don't happen, I'm a liar.

1074
01:27:16,351 --> 01:27:19,836
Go watch the game?
- Yeah, watch the game.

1075
01:27:20,095 --> 01:27:23,675
Frank, they're gonna make you
for Sissy Clark's murder.

1076
01:27:23,775 --> 01:27:26,427
And they're gonna match that
with the Nightingale murders.

1077
01:27:26,527 --> 01:27:30,105
Do you understand what that means?

1078
01:27:31,039 --> 01:27:34,609
His wife is here.
She wants to talk to you.

1079
01:28:16,192 --> 01:28:19,422
Let's walk, Jules.
Get a cup of coffee.

1080
01:28:43,039 --> 01:28:44,828
How you doin'?

1081
01:28:44,928 --> 01:28:47,483
You got a collar in here
for the Nightingale murders?

1082
01:28:47,583 --> 01:28:49,583
Yeah.

1083
01:29:01,439 --> 01:29:04,538
Everything okay with you and Frank?

1084
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:08,571
Yeah, we're good. He works hard.
I work hard. We're good.

1085
01:29:08,671 --> 01:29:10,843
Who's Sissy Clark, Satch?

1086
01:29:14,975 --> 01:29:17,884
Do you know where Frank was last night?

1087
01:29:17,984 --> 01:29:21,044
Yeah, he was working. He had a tour.

1088
01:29:46,623 --> 01:29:48,623
Sit down.

1089
01:29:51,519 --> 01:29:53,644
Did you hear what I said?

1090
01:30:05,087 --> 01:30:07,087
So how'd you know?

1091
01:30:08,287 --> 01:30:10,141
Hey, this guy tried...
- How you doin'?

1092
01:30:10,241 --> 01:30:11,387
What's happening?

1093
01:30:11,487 --> 01:30:14,043
Shut up, asshole.
Mind if we take this outside?

1094
01:30:14,143 --> 01:30:19,073
He's trying to kill me.
Find Satch. He's trying to kill me.

1095
01:30:21,727 --> 01:30:24,617
What are you doing with my collar?

1096
01:30:26,623 --> 01:30:29,340
Listen, I'm sorry, pal.
I didn't mean to step on your toes.

1097
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:32,123
They sent me from downstairs.
I thought you'd be with him.

1098
01:30:32,223 --> 01:30:34,427
What are you looking at him for?

1099
01:30:34,527 --> 01:30:38,947
He matches a description
of an armed robbery suspect.

1100
01:30:38,975 --> 01:30:41,115
So tell me about the radio.

1101
01:30:41,215 --> 01:30:43,195
Who's he talking to on that thing?

1102
01:30:43,295 --> 01:30:45,499
John. He's a cop.

1103
01:30:45,599 --> 01:30:49,371
He talks to him all the time.
I've talked to him, too.

1104
01:30:49,471 --> 01:30:54,299
You talk to Johnny on the radio?
- Yeah. John. What's going on?

1105
01:30:54,399 --> 01:30:59,754
You come and take Frank and now
you're talking to me like a cop.

1106
01:31:00,959 --> 01:31:03,195
I'm talking to you as a friend.

1107
01:31:03,295 --> 01:31:07,157
'Cause as a cop I wouldn't be here at all.

1108
01:31:09,823 --> 01:31:11,823
Listen, Jules...

1109
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:14,492
...they're gonna take me off this case.

1110
01:31:14,592 --> 01:31:19,607
And then Frank is gonna tell them
what he's been tellin' me.

1111
01:31:19,903 --> 01:31:23,963
And then nobody is gonna
be able to help him. Okay?

1112
01:31:24,063 --> 01:31:26,443
Cleon Jones makes the catch.

1113
01:31:28,767 --> 01:31:32,827
Half the uniforms are at the game.
It'll be a riot if they pull it off.

1114
01:31:32,927 --> 01:31:34,927
What is he telling you?

1115
01:31:36,063 --> 01:31:39,991
That he's talking to Johnny on the radio.

1116
01:31:40,095 --> 01:31:42,364
Yeah. John, the cop.
I told you that.

1117
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:45,529
No, he says that John...

1118
01:31:45,631 --> 01:31:48,731
...is your son, Johnny, little Johnny...

1119
01:31:48,831 --> 01:31:51,164
...on the radio in the future.

1120
01:31:51,264 --> 01:31:53,264
On the radio. You see?

1121
01:31:55,775 --> 01:31:58,743
No. You misunderstood him.

1122
01:32:15,231 --> 01:32:17,620
Sissy Clark?
- Yeah.

1123
01:32:17,727 --> 01:32:21,552
She's a nurse.
And she was murdered yesterday.

1124
01:32:23,583 --> 01:32:25,819
And Frank is connected.

1125
01:32:25,919 --> 01:32:31,359
He is either a material witness
or accomplice or the perpetrator.

1126
01:32:34,303 --> 01:32:37,788
McNally, who's been thoroughly
in command.

1127
01:32:43,135 --> 01:32:48,065
Cleon starts down to first base,
and DeMiro calls him back.

1128
01:32:50,911 --> 01:32:54,043
Satch, you know he didn't do this.
Right?

1129
01:32:54,143 --> 01:32:56,283
Carrying the baseball,
he's coming over now.

1130
01:32:56,383 --> 01:32:59,739
Hodges showing the baseball to DeMiro.
- Can I see him?

1131
01:32:59,839 --> 01:33:02,363
Hodges... We might have
a shoe polish play here.

1132
01:33:02,463 --> 01:33:05,435
Remember the Nippy Jones shoe polish
play in the 1957 World Series...

1133
01:33:05,535 --> 01:33:07,535
...at Milwaukee?

1134
01:33:08,063 --> 01:33:12,313
Hodges showing it to DeMiro,
who awards first base.

1135
01:33:15,167 --> 01:33:17,167
My God.

1136
01:33:18,399 --> 01:33:20,399
Satch, what's going on?

1137
01:33:21,982 --> 01:33:25,691
Mind if I go back at the fireboy?
I wanna see what he's got.

1138
01:33:25,791 --> 01:33:27,791
Jesus.

1139
01:33:48,383 --> 01:33:50,423
It's out down here.

1140
01:39:41,598 --> 01:39:43,598
Hey, bud.

1141
01:40:01,279 --> 01:40:03,279
Go ahead.

1142
01:40:03,295 --> 01:40:06,140
See if aviation's got a helicopter...

1143
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:10,461
...for commencing an air search
for body in water.

1144
01:40:36,062 --> 01:40:42,330
It was a season and World Series for the
ages for the Mets and MVP Don Clendenon.

1145
01:40:42,430 --> 01:40:46,255
For the Mets faithful,
the New York fans, wow.

1146
01:41:00,799 --> 01:41:03,689
Here's your coffee and cigarettes.

1147
01:41:12,702 --> 01:41:15,452
I'll be upstairs.

1148
01:41:17,727 --> 01:41:22,619
Incredible sun storm has created
a remarkable aurora borealis.

1149
01:41:22,719 --> 01:41:29,094
A cold front, and the aurora is already
dimming and will be over by morning.

1150
01:42:02,943 --> 01:42:06,358
John, are you there?
John, I'm back.

1151
01:42:07,135 --> 01:42:10,075
John, are you there?
- I'm here, Dad.

1152
01:42:10,175 --> 01:42:12,060
We did it, son.
- What?

1153
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:13,979
We stopped him.
- We did?

1154
01:42:14,079 --> 01:42:15,738
Yeah.

1155
01:42:15,838 --> 01:42:19,323
There's something... Something's wrong.
I don't...

1156
01:42:19,423 --> 01:42:21,423
What's wrong?

1157
01:42:22,078 --> 01:42:25,018
If we stopped him,
why isn't Mom here?

1158
01:42:25,118 --> 01:42:28,730
Why don't I remember her being okay?

1159
01:42:28,830 --> 01:42:31,896
But I killed him. He's dead.

1160
01:42:37,598 --> 01:42:39,258
My turn to steal...

1161
01:42:39,358 --> 01:42:41,398
...your life away.

1162
01:42:41,503 --> 01:42:43,543
John? Johnny, you there?

1163
01:43:23,262 --> 01:43:25,262
Hey, bud.

1164
01:43:45,758 --> 01:43:47,962
Julia.

1165
01:44:07,582 --> 01:44:08,763
Mommy?

1166
01:44:08,863 --> 01:44:10,863
No.

1167
01:44:18,846 --> 01:44:20,846
Hey, Johnny.

1168
01:44:32,607 --> 01:44:34,646
It's okay, it's okay.

1169
01:44:38,174 --> 01:44:41,082
What are you gonna do, Frank?
Put the gun down.

1170
01:44:41,182 --> 01:44:43,222
Let him go.

1171
01:44:43,326 --> 01:44:45,326
You put the gun down.

1172
01:44:49,566 --> 01:44:52,966
I'll snap his neck.
Put the gun down now.

1173
01:45:04,606 --> 01:45:08,403
Time to die, Sullivan.
Time to die.

1174
01:45:09,982 --> 01:45:11,738
Run, Johnny, run, run, run.

1175
01:45:11,838 --> 01:45:13,838
Run.

1176
01:45:29,694 --> 01:45:31,516
Come here. You all right?

1177
01:45:31,616 --> 01:45:34,036
You all right?

1178
01:46:20,318 --> 01:46:22,318
I'm still here, Chief.

1179
01:46:59,710 --> 01:47:02,515
'Round the horn, 'round the horn.

1180
01:47:09,086 --> 01:47:10,427
Come on, new batter,
new batter, new batter.

1181
01:47:10,527 --> 01:47:12,527
Come on, Frank.

1182
01:47:14,398 --> 01:47:17,659
The Benz. Not the Benz.

1183
01:47:22,686 --> 01:47:25,052
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1184
01:47:26,974 --> 01:47:28,348
Nice hittin', Frank.

1185
01:47:28,448 --> 01:47:30,332
Way to go.

1186
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:32,432
Thank you very much.

1187
01:47:34,878 --> 01:47:37,244
Let's play some ball.

1188
01:47:37,344 --> 01:47:40,999
Come on.
New batter, new batter, new batter.

1189
01:47:41,406 --> 01:47:44,406
Go get it.
He's slow. He's old.

1190
01:47:49,886 --> 01:47:53,201
Come on, Johnny.
- Bring me home, Chief.

1191
01:53:26,718 --> 01:53:31,393
