1
00:02:03,967 --> 00:02:08,306
Diane. 6:18 am Room 315,

2
00:02:08,306 --> 00:02:11,240
Great Northern Hotel
up here in Twin Peaks.

3
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,535
Slept pretty well.
Non-smoking room, no tobacco smell.

4
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:17,468
That's a nice consideration
for the business traveller.

5
00:02:17,468 --> 00:02:21,690
A hint of Douglas fir needles in the air.

6
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:25,739
As Sheriff Truman indicated, everything
this hotel promised, they delivered.

7
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:28,956
Clean, reasonably-priced
accommodations.

8
00:02:28,956 --> 00:02:33,304
Telephone works, bathroom in tip-top
shape: no drips, plenty of hot water

9
00:02:33,304 --> 00:02:38,032
and good steady pressure that could
be a side-benefit of the waterfall outside.

10
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:42,755
Mattress firm but not too firm. No lumps,
like that time I told you about in El Paso.

11
00:02:42,755 --> 00:02:45,012
What a nightmare that was!

12
00:02:45,012 --> 00:02:48,477
But I've told you that story
once or twice, haven't l, Diane?

13
00:02:48,477 --> 00:02:53,249
Haven't tried the TV yet. Looks like
cable, probably no reception problems.

14
00:02:53,249 --> 00:02:58,466
But the true test of any hotel
is that morning cup of coffee,

15
00:02:58,466 --> 00:03:01,098
which I'll get back to you about.

16
00:03:10,516 --> 00:03:14,438
Diane, it struck me again
earlier this morning,

17
00:03:14,438 --> 00:03:17,369
there are two things
that continue to trouble me,

18
00:03:17,369 --> 00:03:21,462
not only as an agent of the Bureau,
but as a human being.

19
00:03:21,462 --> 00:03:25,807
What really went on between
Marilyn Monroe and the Kennedys?

20
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:29,655
And who really pulled
the trigger on JFK?

21
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,086
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

22
00:03:47,511 --> 00:03:52,682
You know, this is, excuse me,
a damn fine cup of coffee.

23
00:03:53,154 --> 00:03:56,447
I've had I can't say how many
cups of coffee in my life.

24
00:03:56,447 --> 00:03:58,828
This is one of the best.

25
00:03:58,828 --> 00:04:04,439
I'd like two eggs over hard. It's hard on
the arteries, but old habits die hard.

26
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:08,905
About as hard as I want those eggs.
Bacon, super crispy.

27
00:04:08,905 --> 00:04:13,419
Almost burned. Cremated.
That's great.

28
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:17,892
And I'll have the grapefruit juice,
just as long as those grapefruits...

29
00:04:20,325 --> 00:04:21,607
are freshly squeezed.

30
00:04:24,672 --> 00:04:26,051
Audrey Horne.

31
00:04:29,688 --> 00:04:33,398
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Special Agent Dale Cooper.

32
00:04:37,547 --> 00:04:39,343
Can I sit here?

33
00:04:39,343 --> 00:04:42,770
Unless I miss my guess,
your father is Benjamin Horne,

34
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:47,035
the owner of this establishment, so I
imagine you can sit anywhere you like.

35
00:04:47,035 --> 00:04:51,460
I'd also add, it would be my pleasure.
- Thank you.

36
00:04:54,602 --> 00:04:57,527
You're here investigating
the murder of Laura Palmer.

37
00:04:57,527 --> 00:04:59,492
Were you friends?

38
00:05:02,796 --> 00:05:07,634
Not exactly. Laura tutored my older
brother Johnny three times a week.

39
00:05:08,273 --> 00:05:11,399
Johnny's 27
and he's in the third grade.

40
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:15,586
He's got emotional problems.
It runs in the family.

41
00:05:15,586 --> 00:05:18,210
Do you like my ring?

42
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,642
Very nice.

43
00:05:26,037 --> 00:05:29,996
You know, sometimes
I get so flushed, it's interesting.

44
00:05:32,141 --> 00:05:35,018
Do your palms ever itch?

45
00:05:47,816 --> 00:05:50,609
Morning, Deputy.
Hey, Lucy.

46
00:05:50,827 --> 00:05:54,880
Agent Cooper,
I got a jelly for you specially.

47
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,091
The Sheriff's in the conference room.
It's the door across from the...

48
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,811
I'll look for him in the conference room.

49
00:06:04,495 --> 00:06:06,373
Hey, three for three.

50
00:06:06,878 --> 00:06:11,598
Let's get James Hurley from cell four
and talk to him. He loved Laura Palmer.

51
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:15,525
I bet she told him whatever dirt
she knew about Mike and Bobby.

52
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:18,075
Then let's chat
with those two perpetrators.

53
00:06:18,075 --> 00:06:20,923
Let's run a top-to-bottom
on Bobby's vehicle.

54
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:24,349
Also check Laura Palmer's
autopsy and see what that brings.

55
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:28,650
We'll talk to Mr and Mrs Palmer, but let's
give them time to deal with their grief.

56
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,910
We've got our day mapped out.
Let's meet in three minutes.

57
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,040
I really have to urinate.

58
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:38,981
By the way, the coffee
at the Great Northern, incredible.

59
00:06:47,176 --> 00:06:50,052
Harry, as you know, I delivered Laura.

60
00:06:50,052 --> 00:06:54,483
I've known her all her life.
She was my daughter's best friend.

61
00:06:54,483 --> 00:06:56,863
I couldn't face doing
the post-mortem,

62
00:06:56,863 --> 00:07:01,213
so I called
Joe Fielding in from Fairvale.

63
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:06,607
He did the work, I assisted.
This is what he found.

64
00:07:06,607 --> 00:07:10,620
Time of death estimated to be between
midnight and 4:00 am.

65
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,674
What killed her is loss of blood.
Numerous shallow wounds.

66
00:07:14,674 --> 00:07:18,266
No single one serious
enough to have caused death.

67
00:07:18,266 --> 00:07:22,193
Bite marks on her shoulders,
also on her tongue,

68
00:07:23,292 --> 00:07:26,252
probably self-inflicted.

69
00:07:27,138 --> 00:07:31,359
Lesions on wrists, ankles, upper arms,
where she was bound.

70
00:07:31,861 --> 00:07:35,820
We're waiting on the tox ological
tests for drug use.

71
00:07:37,171 --> 00:07:39,845
Within the last...

72
00:07:39,845 --> 00:07:44,774
12 hours, she'd had sexual relations
with at least three men.

73
00:07:45,824 --> 00:07:47,986
You've examined
Ronnette Pulaski, as well?

74
00:07:47,986 --> 00:07:49,869
Yes, sir.

75
00:07:50,087 --> 00:07:53,345
There's no question in my mind
the same perpetrator

76
00:07:53,345 --> 00:07:56,807
attacked both of them in that train car.

77
00:07:56,807 --> 00:08:01,990
Doc, when, if ever,
will Ronnette be able to talk to us?

78
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:07,262
She had a severe head injury.
It's still early to tell.

79
00:08:07,262 --> 00:08:12,487
Add to that the psychological impact
of the fear,

80
00:08:13,956 --> 00:08:19,805
probably witnessing what was
happening to Laura before she...

81
00:08:24,266 --> 00:08:26,395
So beautiful.

82
00:08:30,913 --> 00:08:34,040
Who would do a thing like that?

83
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,599
Leo.

84
00:08:40,611 --> 00:08:45,331
Leo, honey, I have to go to work now
and Norma should be here any sec.

85
00:08:46,045 --> 00:08:47,793
Leo.

86
00:08:48,721 --> 00:08:50,349
Did you finish cleaning my boots?

87
00:08:51,522 --> 00:08:54,065
Yeah, I did the laundry too.

88
00:08:54,573 --> 00:08:56,701
All of it?

89
00:08:57,123 --> 00:08:58,621
Well, yeah.

90
00:09:01,094 --> 00:09:02,377
No, you didn't.

91
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,157
OK, Leo, when I get home, I'll do it.
- Now, Shelly.

92
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:15,054
OK.

93
00:09:38,966 --> 00:09:39,686
Blood.

94
00:09:41,517 --> 00:09:43,729
Shelly, Norma's here.

95
00:09:48,498 --> 00:09:51,791
Shelly, did you hear me say
Norma's here?

96
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,345
Yeah, I heard you, Leo.

97
00:09:58,906 --> 00:10:01,201
I'm going to come by the diner today.

98
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:09,014
Be a good girl
and save me a piece of pie.

99
00:10:11,488 --> 00:10:13,782
Sure, Leo.

100
00:10:23,946 --> 00:10:27,787
James, you were arrested for suspicion
of the murder of Laura Palmer.

101
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:30,675
You have no previous
criminal record, correct?

102
00:10:30,675 --> 00:10:32,216
Nothing, no, sir.

103
00:10:41,544 --> 00:10:44,469
Did you shoot this video?

104
00:10:51,827 --> 00:10:54,455
It's your cycle, isn't it?

105
00:10:58,348 --> 00:11:02,986
Yes, sir. The three of us went
up there two Sundays ago.

106
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,293
James, you were in love with Laura.

107
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:11,966
The two of you were
seeing each other secretly.

108
00:11:11,966 --> 00:11:16,863
No one else at school
or any of her friends knew about it.

109
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:20,999
She was the homecoming queen,
dating the captain of the football team,

110
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:24,264
how long did you think you
could keep this relationship secret?

111
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,838
It was secret
because that's the way she wanted it.

112
00:11:29,838 --> 00:11:33,180
Why? Was she afraid of Bobby?

113
00:11:35,002 --> 00:11:39,971
I think so.
- So she was using cocaine?

114
00:11:41,773 --> 00:11:45,828
Yes.
- Did you ever use cocaine with her?

115
00:11:45,828 --> 00:11:49,710
No. I tried to get her to stop.
And she did. For a while.

116
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,838
Why did she start again?

117
00:11:54,063 --> 00:11:57,939
Something happened two days ago.
- What? What happened?

118
00:11:59,455 --> 00:12:01,583
I don't know.

119
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:06,308
I think something scared her because
she wouldn't see me or talk to me.

120
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:15,332
When did you last see her?

121
00:12:17,724 --> 00:12:19,803
The night she died.

122
00:12:21,234 --> 00:12:23,992
She snuck out of her house about 9:30.

123
00:12:23,992 --> 00:12:29,088
About 12:30, I stopped the bike
at the light at Sparkwood and 21.

124
00:12:29,088 --> 00:12:32,429
And she jumped off and ran away.

125
00:12:36,117 --> 00:12:39,160
I didn't see her again.

126
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:44,599
Did you have a fight?

127
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:50,909
Not exactly. But she said
she couldn't see me anymore.

128
00:12:50,909 --> 00:12:52,287
Why?

129
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:56,594
She didn't say.

130
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:03,613
Recognise this?

131
00:13:07,342 --> 00:13:09,423
Yes, sir.

132
00:13:19,172 --> 00:13:21,669
James, what happened on February 5th,

133
00:13:22,307 --> 00:13:26,063
and who has the other half of this heart?

134
00:13:31,712 --> 00:13:35,338
James, guess why I'm so happy today.

135
00:13:35,338 --> 00:13:39,821
Because your skin is so soft
and you smell so good?

136
00:13:39,821 --> 00:13:42,486
No.
- Why?

137
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:51,485
Because I really believe
that you love me.

138
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:58,838
Now my heart belongs to you.

139
00:14:03,483 --> 00:14:06,026
I don't know.

140
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:11,840
Damn it.

141
00:14:14,643 --> 00:14:16,974
Where's that shirt?

142
00:14:21,206 --> 00:14:21,956
No!

143
00:14:32,034 --> 00:14:37,086
Hey, Bopper, since when does Leo
Johnson call me at my parents' house?

144
00:14:37,885 --> 00:14:42,973
Leo called you?
- Yesterday. He was looking for you.

145
00:14:42,973 --> 00:14:47,029
He wanted to know where
the other half of the money was.

146
00:14:48,043 --> 00:14:50,254
What did you tell him, Snake?

147
00:14:50,254 --> 00:14:52,672
As far as I knew,
he didn't have any yet,

148
00:14:52,672 --> 00:14:56,066
'cause I thought we were
supposed to give it to him today.

149
00:14:56,066 --> 00:15:01,205
Yeah, well, I gave him half already.

150
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:07,848
When did you see him?

151
00:15:07,848 --> 00:15:12,744
Hey, I saw him the other night, OK?
- What night?

152
00:15:12,744 --> 00:15:15,452
The night Laura died.

153
00:15:15,452 --> 00:15:17,088
I saw Leo,

154
00:15:17,088 --> 00:15:21,900
because I had this money burning
a $10,000 hole in my pocket.

155
00:15:23,282 --> 00:15:25,445
What about the other half?

156
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:32,352
It's in Laura's safe deposit box.
- So you didn't get it back from her?

157
00:15:32,352 --> 00:15:35,481
She was supposed to hand it over
today, then she checked out.

158
00:15:35,481 --> 00:15:38,865
So how are we supposed
to get ten grand for Leo?

159
00:15:38,865 --> 00:15:41,924
Maybe we could
sell light bulbs door-to-door.

160
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:44,257
That's great. That's just...great.

161
00:15:44,257 --> 00:15:47,649
This isn't funny, Bobby.
- I'm not laughing.

162
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:51,779
We're lucky we're in jail. You know
what Leo will do when we get out.

163
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:53,159
Shut up.

164
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:56,596
Don't mention one word about Leo
Johnson. You do not know...

165
00:15:56,596 --> 00:15:58,763
Leo Johnson.

166
00:16:51,214 --> 00:16:53,590
Help me.

167
00:16:55,895 --> 00:16:57,476
Mom.

168
00:16:58,068 --> 00:16:59,864
Mom.

169
00:17:00,326 --> 00:17:02,370
Hi, honey.

170
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:05,674
Why didn't you wake me?
I had to go to the Sheriff's office.

171
00:17:05,674 --> 00:17:09,768
They called and said they could
wait until tomorrow to see you.

172
00:17:09,768 --> 00:17:12,311
We thought you needed your rest.

173
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:16,449
You woke us crying in your sleep
last night. Do you remember?

174
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:17,769
No. Really?

175
00:17:20,475 --> 00:17:24,731
I feel so badly for you. I'm so sorry.

176
00:17:25,992 --> 00:17:28,239
Mom, it's so strange.

177
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:35,895
I know I should be sad
and I am, part of me is.

178
00:17:37,236 --> 00:17:39,233
But it's like...

179
00:17:40,289 --> 00:17:43,748
it's like I'm having
the most beautifuI dream

180
00:17:45,221 --> 00:17:47,551
and the most terrible nightmare
all at once.

181
00:17:47,551 --> 00:17:51,611
Your father said you saw
a boy named James Hurley last night.

182
00:17:51,611 --> 00:17:55,450
Is this to do with him?
- Can this be between you and me?

183
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,169
Of course.

184
00:17:58,347 --> 00:18:03,019
James and Laura were seeing each
other the last two months.

185
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:07,999
I was the only one who knew about it.
James was so good for her.

186
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:12,594
You don't know how troubled Laura
was. Last night I had to see him.

187
00:18:12,594 --> 00:18:17,446
We were the two closest people
in the world to her.

188
00:18:18,621 --> 00:18:22,543
But I feel so bad now.
- Why, angel?

189
00:18:24,724 --> 00:18:27,565
Because we realised...

190
00:18:29,866 --> 00:18:32,279
that all this time...

191
00:18:34,088 --> 00:18:37,215
we were the ones falling in love.

192
00:18:41,362 --> 00:18:45,618
So I feel like
I've betrayed my best friend.

193
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,586
And if it's true...

194
00:18:52,104 --> 00:18:54,862
then why am I so happy?

195
00:18:55,407 --> 00:18:56,785
Oh, honey.

196
00:19:05,314 --> 00:19:09,570
What do you want to do? Should we
see these guys separately or together?

197
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,622
No, we can see them together.
- OK.

198
00:19:12,622 --> 00:19:16,505
Hey, Ed, how's that coconut?

199
00:19:16,505 --> 00:19:20,227
It's kind of tender,
but my pride hurts worse.

200
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:24,161
This is Special Agent Dale Cooper.
- Pleasure.

201
00:19:24,161 --> 00:19:28,387
Any relation to James?
- I'm his uncle. He works in my garage.

202
00:19:28,387 --> 00:19:31,016
His mother's away.
I'm looking after him.

203
00:19:31,857 --> 00:19:34,319
You plan on holding him?
- No.

204
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,956
We can release him into your custody.
- Is James being charged?

205
00:19:38,956 --> 00:19:43,221
I had one small doubt which
he cleared up. He didn't kill anybody.

206
00:19:43,221 --> 00:19:46,896
But tell him to be careful,
we're releasing Mike and Bobby also.

207
00:19:47,617 --> 00:19:49,448
Will do.
- Agent Cooper.

208
00:19:49,448 --> 00:19:54,219
I've got a call for you from a Mr Albert
Rosenfield. Sounds long distance.

209
00:19:54,219 --> 00:19:56,434
Excuse me.
- Sure.

210
00:19:56,646 --> 00:20:02,329
It has that open air sound, you know,
like wind blowing through trees.

211
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:04,044
Yes.

212
00:20:04,044 --> 00:20:08,224
About last night at the Roadhouse,
something's not right.

213
00:20:08,224 --> 00:20:12,988
Seeing the bandage I thought maybe
Nadine caught wind of you and Norma.

214
00:20:12,988 --> 00:20:16,957
If Nadine found out, I'd be playing
harp for the Heavenly All-Stars.

215
00:20:16,957 --> 00:20:19,174
True.
- I was with Norma.

216
00:20:19,174 --> 00:20:21,764
But I was also on my stake-out.

217
00:20:21,764 --> 00:20:24,349
I remember Mike and Bobby
grabbing Donna.

218
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:28,280
I got up to walk over,
and I got light-headed.

219
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,292
I was out on my feet before I got there.
I don't remember getting hit.

220
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:36,055
What do you mean?
- I think my beer was drugged.

221
00:20:36,055 --> 00:20:37,897
Jacques Renault was tending bar.

222
00:20:41,249 --> 00:20:44,958
All right, Albert. You can
have the body all day tomorrow.

223
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:49,274
No, I can't do it. They're going
to put her in the ground on Monday.

224
00:20:49,274 --> 00:20:52,242
If you come up through Lewis Fork,

225
00:20:52,242 --> 00:20:56,922
I can recommend a place for lunch:
The Lamplighter Inn.

226
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:01,729
They got a cherry pie there
that'll kill you.

227
00:21:19,498 --> 00:21:22,042
Hi, Nadine.
- What are you doing here, Norma?

228
00:21:22,842 --> 00:21:24,470
I might ask you the same.

229
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:29,604
And I'll tell you. I've gotten
all new drapes for my house.

230
00:21:29,604 --> 00:21:32,200
Ed bought 'em for me
yesterday at Gentleman Jim's,

231
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,667
and we installed them together.

232
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:36,385
They're a beige sheer.

233
00:21:37,472 --> 00:21:41,099
I was up all last night.
Do you know what I was doing?

234
00:21:42,112 --> 00:21:43,396
No, I don't.

235
00:21:43,396 --> 00:21:48,706
I was inventing a noiseless,
completely silent drape runner.

236
00:21:49,428 --> 00:21:53,055
Do you know what makes it work?

237
00:21:53,055 --> 00:21:55,443
The thing I thought
of at four this morning

238
00:21:55,443 --> 00:22:00,917
when I was waiting for my husband
to be released from intensive care?

239
00:22:03,307 --> 00:22:04,935
Cotton balls.

240
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:11,283
By God, those things
will be quiet now.

241
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,246
Did you have to post bail?

242
00:22:26,246 --> 00:22:29,757
No. I had a talk with Harry.
There's no charge.

243
00:22:29,757 --> 00:22:32,228
Mom still out of town?

244
00:22:32,228 --> 00:22:35,860
Yeah, she's still out of town.
Let's get out of here.

245
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:40,211
I'll need help from the Bookhouse Boys.
Somebody's got to watch my back.

246
00:22:40,211 --> 00:22:42,382
Already got it covered.

247
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:48,534
Hi, Mike, Bobby.

248
00:22:50,124 --> 00:22:53,001
Before we start,
have you two got your story straight?

249
00:22:53,762 --> 00:22:59,112
If we tell the truth, we don't
have to get our stories straight.

250
00:22:59,112 --> 00:23:03,702
Besides, the Sheriff told us we're just in
here for fighting and it was self-defence.

251
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:08,641
Right. Well, I guess you can go then.

252
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,552
Now?

253
00:23:16,418 --> 00:23:19,296
Oh, fellas, one more thing.

254
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:21,716
Pray for the safety of James Hurley,

255
00:23:21,716 --> 00:23:26,732
because if anything happens to him,
we're coming for you.

256
00:23:30,463 --> 00:23:33,554
Sheriff, what are you sitting around for?
We've got people to see.

257
00:23:33,554 --> 00:23:36,440
I'd better start studying medicine.
- Why?

258
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,781
Because I'm beginning
to feel a bit like Doctor Watson.

259
00:23:50,015 --> 00:23:52,939
On top of the morning to you, Pete.

260
00:23:52,939 --> 00:23:58,667
No, Josie, the expression
is "top of the morning".

261
00:23:58,667 --> 00:24:01,415
And it's just barely morning.

262
00:24:05,064 --> 00:24:09,902
Pete, I want to thank you for yesterday.

263
00:24:09,902 --> 00:24:12,374
For standing up to me with Catherine.

264
00:24:12,374 --> 00:24:18,771
Forget it. Catherine was wrong yesterday.
Period.

265
00:24:19,569 --> 00:24:21,401
Thank you, anyway.

266
00:24:24,585 --> 00:24:26,916
Hello.
- Pete, it's Harry.

267
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:31,266
I've got Agent Cooper with me,
we're here to see Mrs Packard.

268
00:24:33,823 --> 00:24:37,664
I will make a fresh pot of coffee.

269
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:47,862
Hi, Sheriff.
- Mrs Packard.

270
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:52,090
Dale Cooper, FBI. Remember him
from last night's town meeting?

271
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,880
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

272
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,386
Agent Cooper,
you remember Pete Martell.

273
00:24:56,386 --> 00:24:58,020
You bet.

274
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,446
Can we offer you a cup of joe?

275
00:25:00,446 --> 00:25:04,036
You said the magic word.
- I'd love a cup.

276
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:07,007
I'll pour that for you.

277
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:10,897
Mr Cooper, how do you take it?

278
00:25:10,897 --> 00:25:14,446
Black as midnight on a moonless night.

279
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:17,838
Pretty black.
- Please sit down.

280
00:25:17,838 --> 00:25:19,714
Thank you.

281
00:25:22,816 --> 00:25:25,277
Mrs Packard,
I'll come straight to the point.

282
00:25:25,277 --> 00:25:27,410
You hired Laura Palmer

283
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:30,547
to help you with your English, correct?

284
00:25:30,547 --> 00:25:34,307
Yes.
- When did you last see her?

285
00:25:35,482 --> 00:25:39,323
Thursday afternoon.
About the time the mill blew five.

286
00:25:39,323 --> 00:25:42,580
That would be five o'clock?
- Yes.

287
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:47,059
When did she leave?
- In an hour, when the lesson finished.

288
00:25:47,687 --> 00:25:51,991
I didn't see her again.
- How did she seem on Thursday?

289
00:25:51,991 --> 00:25:58,510
Something was bothering her,
but we didn't have a heart-to-heart on it.

290
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:02,896
Something she said, though,
that stuck on my mind.

291
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:10,008
She said, "I think now I understand how
you feel about your husband's death."

292
00:26:11,474 --> 00:26:13,601
Did she say
what that was in reference to?

293
00:26:14,023 --> 00:26:17,447
No, but after what happened to her,

294
00:26:17,447 --> 00:26:23,800
I can't help hearing it in my head,
like some haunting melody.

295
00:26:28,403 --> 00:26:30,365
Excuse me.
- Certainly.

296
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:35,880
So, Harry,
how long you been seeing her?

297
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:41,563
How did you know?

298
00:26:41,563 --> 00:26:43,740
Body language.

299
00:26:44,161 --> 00:26:46,124
Jeez Louise!

300
00:26:49,095 --> 00:26:51,639
Not long, six weeks.

301
00:26:52,982 --> 00:26:56,276
Andrew died a year and a half ago.

302
00:27:00,297 --> 00:27:02,426
Don't drink that.

303
00:27:03,475 --> 00:27:09,491
You'd never guess.
There was a fish in the percolator.

304
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:13,685
Sorry.

305
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,252
Yes, Catherine, I'm listening.

306
00:27:27,252 --> 00:27:32,736
You should know what your sentimental
shenanigans cost us yesterday.

307
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,823
You do know what shenanigans are?

308
00:27:36,665 --> 00:27:41,920
Shutting down the mill
cost us $87,000 and change.

309
00:27:42,685 --> 00:27:46,988
You really think that would've made
brother Andrew happy?

310
00:28:15,248 --> 00:28:18,708
Jocelyn... Mrs Packard.

311
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:22,844
What is "shenanigans"?

312
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,119
Nonsense, mischief,
often a deceitful or treacherous trick.

313
00:28:32,681 --> 00:28:37,852
Why do you always have to rush off?
- It's been over an hour.

314
00:28:37,852 --> 00:28:42,620
There was a time when
we used to take the whole afternoon.

315
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:48,764
In the sweetness of passing time,
this hour will soon seem like a day.

316
00:28:50,153 --> 00:28:51,901
Sing it to somebody else.

317
00:28:51,901 --> 00:28:55,869
I'm no pea-brained chambermaid
looking for a tumble in the broom closet.

318
00:28:56,424 --> 00:29:00,561
Sorry, didn't mean to offend
your delicate sensibilities.

319
00:29:00,561 --> 00:29:05,776
Oh, no, my mistake. I'd gotten used to
our conducting business and pleasure.

320
00:29:05,776 --> 00:29:10,918
Sweetheart, it's all the same to me.

321
00:29:11,557 --> 00:29:14,767
Don't sweetheart me, you old dog.

322
00:29:16,196 --> 00:29:18,443
I'm no schoolgirl, either.

323
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,551
What's the next step?
Do we escalate?

324
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,010
We may not have to do anything.

325
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:29,278
A few more local tragedies,

326
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:33,668
and Josie might just run the old mill
into the ground by herself.

327
00:29:33,668 --> 00:29:38,925
At the rate we're going, it's going to be
years before the mill's bankrupt.

328
00:29:38,925 --> 00:29:40,773
I don't want to wait any longer.

329
00:29:40,773 --> 00:29:44,865
Besides, my knothead husband
may peek in the ledger

330
00:29:44,865 --> 00:29:47,791
and sniff out the creative arithmetic.

331
00:29:49,262 --> 00:29:53,351
Maybe it's time to start a little fire.

332
00:29:53,901 --> 00:29:56,279
Are you talking business or pleasure?

333
00:29:57,914 --> 00:30:02,218
I'm talking about the Packard sawmill.

334
00:30:06,275 --> 00:30:10,994
All that dry timber lying around...

335
00:30:11,834 --> 00:30:14,676
A stray spark...

336
00:30:15,387 --> 00:30:16,801
one night...

337
00:30:16,801 --> 00:30:21,529
Some night when Pete's off
on a toot with Smokey the bear.

338
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:28,172
Now I remember how all those hours...

339
00:30:29,265 --> 00:30:31,512
turned into days.

340
00:30:45,191 --> 00:30:46,987
Sarah, darling,

341
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:51,246
I'm sorry to disturb you, sweetheart,

342
00:30:51,246 --> 00:30:53,542
but Donna Hayward is here.

343
00:30:54,723 --> 00:30:56,470
Take this now.

344
00:30:57,607 --> 00:30:59,902
I'll send her in.

345
00:31:02,916 --> 00:31:06,970
Try not to upset her.
- OK.

346
00:31:20,891 --> 00:31:23,304
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

347
00:31:26,075 --> 00:31:29,748
I miss her so much.

348
00:31:31,551 --> 00:31:36,603
Do you miss her?
- Yes, I miss her so much.

349
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:38,269
I miss her so much.

350
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,763
I miss her so much.
I miss her so much.

351
00:32:01,815 --> 00:32:08,579
Laura! Oh, Laura, my baby.
Oh, Laura, my baby.

352
00:32:21,796 --> 00:32:24,758
Sarah! Sarah!
- Leland! Leland!

353
00:32:27,022 --> 00:32:30,980
It's all right, sweetheart, it's all right.

354
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:35,290
Calm down.
Calm down, sweetheart, please.

355
00:32:41,736 --> 00:32:45,695
So neither of you saw
Ronnette after school that day?

356
00:32:47,254 --> 00:32:48,586
That's right.

357
00:32:48,586 --> 00:32:51,517
As far as you know,
she went to her job?

358
00:32:51,517 --> 00:32:55,150
Yes, Horne's department store
downtown.

359
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:58,995
What did she do
at the department store?

360
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,541
She was a...

361
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:08,187
a salesgirl at the perfume counter.

362
00:33:09,283 --> 00:33:13,753
She used to joke it was the sweetest
smelling job she'd ever had.

363
00:33:25,085 --> 00:33:26,333
Excuse me.

364
00:34:40,686 --> 00:34:47,069
How many times have I asked you not
to disturb the guests with this racket?

365
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:50,212
About 4,000.

366
00:34:59,412 --> 00:35:01,409
Audrey.

367
00:35:04,179 --> 00:35:11,156
Julie tells me that you were in
with the Norwegians,

368
00:35:11,156 --> 00:35:15,998
just before they all suddenly decided,
en masse,

369
00:35:15,998 --> 00:35:19,344
to return to the old country...

370
00:35:19,854 --> 00:35:24,324
without signing the contracts.

371
00:35:24,324 --> 00:35:26,580
Is that true?

372
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,580
Yes.

373
00:35:30,221 --> 00:35:32,897
You wouldn't have done
or said anything

374
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:38,151
that might have precipitated their
evacuation, would you?

375
00:35:38,151 --> 00:35:44,216
I mean, I'm assuming
that this was just a coincidence.

376
00:35:44,216 --> 00:35:50,318
Daddy, I did go in there to check out
that ridiculous smorgasbord.

377
00:35:52,459 --> 00:35:57,928
And while I was in there,
I happened to mention that I was sad.

378
00:36:00,235 --> 00:36:02,232
About what?

379
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:07,961
About my dear, close friend
Laura being brutally murdered.

380
00:36:14,531 --> 00:36:16,992
Do you realise

381
00:36:16,992 --> 00:36:21,879
the kind of money that your little
performance just cost this family?

382
00:36:23,685 --> 00:36:26,777
If you ever pull another stunt like that,

383
00:36:26,777 --> 00:36:30,863
you'll be scrubbing bidets
in a Bulgarian convent.

384
00:36:30,863 --> 00:36:33,378
Oh, Daddy, I'm so afraid.

385
00:36:39,361 --> 00:36:41,941
Laura died two days ago.

386
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:46,247
I lost you years ago.

387
00:37:05,069 --> 00:37:09,326
For what we are about to receive,
may the Lord make us truly thankful.

388
00:37:11,047 --> 00:37:13,722
I was hoping we'd have the chance

389
00:37:13,722 --> 00:37:15,933
to discuss the recent events.

390
00:37:16,983 --> 00:37:19,063
Not necessarily
the physical events themselves,

391
00:37:19,063 --> 00:37:22,741
but rather the thoughts and feelings
surrounding them.

392
00:37:23,587 --> 00:37:28,973
Rebellion in a young man your age
is a necessary fact of life,

393
00:37:28,973 --> 00:37:31,524
candidly, a sign of strength.

394
00:37:31,524 --> 00:37:36,417
In other words, Robert,
I respect your rebellious nature.

395
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:41,851
But, as your father, I'm obligated
to contain that fire of contrariness

396
00:37:41,851 --> 00:37:47,033
within the bounds established by society
and within our own family structure.

397
00:37:50,173 --> 00:37:54,180
I note your reluctance
to enter into a dialogue with me.

398
00:37:55,649 --> 00:38:00,369
There are times when silence is golden.
Silence can be taken many ways.

399
00:38:00,369 --> 00:38:07,175
As a sign of intelligence. The quieter
we become, the more we hear.

400
00:38:10,448 --> 00:38:15,120
Now, I am a tolerant man,
but my patience has its limits.

401
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,511
"To have his path made clear is
the aspiration of every human being

402
00:38:18,511 --> 00:38:22,736
"in our beclouded
and tempestuous existence."

403
00:38:22,736 --> 00:38:27,119
Robert, you and I are going
to work to make yours real clear.

404
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:36,400
We're here for you, Bobby.

405
00:38:43,293 --> 00:38:45,455
Anything to go with that, Sheriff?

406
00:38:45,455 --> 00:38:49,223
Agent Cooper might want to try
a slice of that pie.

407
00:38:49,223 --> 00:38:52,064
Cherry pie?
- Best in the Tri-Counties.

408
00:38:54,203 --> 00:38:57,996
Could you ask Norma to stop by?
- Sure thing.

409
00:38:57,996 --> 00:39:01,347
Nothing's a sure thing, Shelly.

410
00:39:02,939 --> 00:39:06,363
I can't get rid of the taste
of that fish-filtered coffee.

411
00:39:06,363 --> 00:39:08,490
Me neither.

412
00:39:09,502 --> 00:39:11,416
Shelly Johnson with a "J"?

413
00:39:13,014 --> 00:39:17,484
Husband's a trucker, Leo.
Minor rap sheet.

414
00:39:24,425 --> 00:39:27,267
Log lady.
- Right.

415
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:28,770
Hi.

416
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:33,871
Can I ask her about her log?

417
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,370
Many have.

418
00:39:39,015 --> 00:39:40,477
Evening.
- Norma.

419
00:39:40,477 --> 00:39:43,688
I'd like you to meet
Special Agent Dale Cooper.

420
00:39:43,688 --> 00:39:47,037
FBI.
- Norma Jennings.

421
00:39:47,037 --> 00:39:50,549
Did Laura Palmer help you
with the meals-on-wheels programme,

422
00:39:50,549 --> 00:39:52,264
delivering to the elderly?

423
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:55,143
Yeah, Laura helped
organise that programme.

424
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:57,814
Do you have a list of
the people on her route?

425
00:39:57,814 --> 00:40:00,536
I can get them.
- Would you?

426
00:40:00,752 --> 00:40:04,010
And two more pieces
of this incredible pie.

427
00:40:05,809 --> 00:40:06,559
OK.

428
00:40:08,067 --> 00:40:12,905
Man, oh, man, you must have
the metabolism of a bumblebee.

429
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:20,522
For your information, I heard you
speaking about Laura Palmer...

430
00:40:20,522 --> 00:40:21,522
Yes?

431
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:27,119
One day, my log
will have something to say about this.

432
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,131
My log saw something that night.

433
00:40:30,131 --> 00:40:32,808
Really? What did it see?

434
00:40:34,653 --> 00:40:36,614
Ask it.

435
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:43,513
I thought so.

436
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,131
Thanks, Norma.
See you tomorrow.

437
00:41:08,846 --> 00:41:12,770
Hi, Leo. I brought you some pie.

438
00:41:18,043 --> 00:41:19,422
Where's my shirt?

439
00:41:20,677 --> 00:41:22,139
What shirt?

440
00:41:23,686 --> 00:41:26,362
My favourite blue shirt.

441
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:30,323
It's the second you lost this year.

442
00:41:31,546 --> 00:41:34,387
I'm going to teach you a lesson

443
00:41:34,387 --> 00:41:37,431
about looking after my property.

444
00:41:38,024 --> 00:41:42,827
This is going to hurt you.
- Please, Leo. No. No.

445
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,441
I'll get it.

446
00:41:59,135 --> 00:42:01,261
Come on.

447
00:42:04,108 --> 00:42:07,402
Mom, Dad,
this is James, James Hurley.

448
00:42:07,402 --> 00:42:09,492
How do you do, James?
- Sir.

449
00:42:09,492 --> 00:42:13,128
Mrs Hayward.
- Nice to meet you, James.

450
00:42:13,975 --> 00:42:17,933
Well, I hope you're hungry.
Eileen's been cooking up a storm.

451
00:42:17,933 --> 00:42:20,157
Yes, sir.

452
00:42:20,157 --> 00:42:21,825
Like a drink?

453
00:42:21,825 --> 00:42:26,340
We have some soft drinks, some
fruit punch and some sparkling cider.

454
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:29,266
Fruit punch,
that would be good, thank you.

455
00:42:29,266 --> 00:42:31,562
I'll get it.
- OK.

456
00:42:31,562 --> 00:42:37,126
Why don't you fellas sit down
at the table and I'll check on the roast.

457
00:42:49,924 --> 00:42:52,848
Your fruit punch.
- Thanks, Donna.

458
00:42:52,848 --> 00:42:55,560
I don't believe I know your parents.

459
00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:00,157
No, sir. My dad died when
I was 10, and my mom travels a lot.

460
00:43:00,157 --> 00:43:02,745
She writes for the paper sometimes.

461
00:43:02,745 --> 00:43:05,926
Ed Hurley down at the gas farm
is James's uncle.

462
00:43:05,926 --> 00:43:09,192
His wife's the lady with the patch.

463
00:43:09,192 --> 00:43:14,117
Yes, sir. That's my aunt Nadine.
She's a real character.

464
00:43:14,117 --> 00:43:18,171
Bill, could you give me a hand, please.

465
00:43:18,171 --> 00:43:20,310
Excuse me.

466
00:43:24,077 --> 00:43:27,999
We can talk after dinner.
- It's good to see you.

467
00:43:28,673 --> 00:43:32,181
It's good to see you, too.

468
00:43:48,572 --> 00:43:50,569
That bastard.

469
00:43:50,569 --> 00:43:53,462
First your girlfriend, then mine.

470
00:43:56,138 --> 00:43:59,598
Too bad we can only kill him once.

471
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:09,680
Hey, what's up, Doc? It's Laura Palmer,
in case you haven't guessed.

472
00:44:10,351 --> 00:44:12,930
I'm making you another tape,

473
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:19,535
which, as you already know, I've
mailed you in one of your envelopes.

474
00:44:19,535 --> 00:44:24,518
It's Thursday the 23rd,
and I am so bored.

475
00:44:24,518 --> 00:44:29,658
Actually, I'm in kind of a weird mood.

476
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:36,851
God, James is sweet,
but he's so dumb.

477
00:44:38,023 --> 00:44:41,365
I should've met you a long time ago,
Doctor Jacoby,

478
00:44:41,365 --> 00:44:46,338
'cause right now
I can take just so much of sweet.

479
00:44:46,338 --> 00:44:53,144
I just know I'm going to get lost in those
woods again tonight. I just know it.

480
00:44:53,144 --> 00:44:59,541
Remember me telling you
about that mystery man, well...
