1
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,000
I've heard it said...

2
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:44,878
that the American dream
is a thing of the past.

3
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:50,259
That the basic tenets of home,
job, and family
are slipping away.

4
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,345
Well, not in my town.

5
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,850
Where I come from,
that dream is still a reality.

6
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,189
Course,
you have to know who's boss.

7
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:22,499
For those who follow my lead,
life can be a paradise.

8
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:28,172
But for those who don't,
it can be a mighty rough road.

9
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,947
Daddy,
what should I wish for?

10
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,908
What should I wish for,
Daddy?

11
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,410
Salvation.

12
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:01,788
Merlyn.

13
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,669
What do you think
I should wish for?

14
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,380
Don't get her going.

15
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,808
It's all right,
you don't have to tell me.
I know.

16
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,773
I'm blowing out
my candles now, Daddy.

17
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,111
Someone's at the door.

18
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,365
Someone's at the door.

19
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:39,868
Someone's at the door.
No.

20
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,828
Someone's at the door.

21
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:43,956
She ain't gonna
do this again.

22
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,666
Someone's at the door.

23
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,293
Shut up!
It's okay, Daddy.
Just give her a minute...

24
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:50,629
Someone's at the door.
...and things
will be all right.

25
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,256
Someone's at the door.

26
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,340
Someone's at the door.

27
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,508
I said shut up!

28
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,176
Leave her alone,
she can't help it!

29
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,971
Someone's at the door.
Shut up, dammit!

30
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,102
Someone's at the door.
Make her stop!

31
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,604
It ain't her fault!
The hell it ain't!

32
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:11,525
Every damn problem
in our miserable lives
is her fault!

33
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,402
Someone's at the door.

34
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,782
It's okay, Merlyn.
Take it easy.
Take it easy, Merlyn.

35
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,200
Someone's at the door.

36
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:23,078
Stop!
Daddy, what are you doing?

37
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,665
I said stop!
Daddy, no!

38
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,295
Don't run away from me.

39
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,963
Merlyn, open the door.

40
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,842
Come back here, girl.
Come on, open the door.

41
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,260
Come on.

42
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:46,185
Someone's at the door.
Open this door, boy!

43
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,520
Someone's at the door.
Open up, boy.

44
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:52,065
Someone's at the door.
Open up right now!

45
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:57,029
Someone's at the door.

46
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:01,241
I can still hear you, girl!

47
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:03,202
Someone's at the door.

48
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,800
Come on, Merlyn,
we gotta go.

49
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:21,678
Come on, Merlyn.
Please, Merlyn, come on!

50
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:28,352
All right, you stay here,
but don't open the door.

51
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,729
Don't open the door,
understand?

52
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,232
I'm gonna get help.

53
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:39,404
Merlyn, stay there,
I'll be right back!
Don't open the door!

54
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,576
Someone's at the door.

55
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,914
Ten long years, Merlyn.

56
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,917
Ten years of hell
you've put us through.

57
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,638
No more running, son.

58
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,605
Someone's at the door.

59
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:17,442
This here's for your mama.

60
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,194
Someone's at the door.

61
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,537
Caleb, wait!

62
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,128
I'll handle this.

63
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:41,633
Listen to me.
I want you to stay right here.

64
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,594
Attaboy.

65
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:49,641
Merlyn.

66
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:54,938
Merlyn... Merlyn...

67
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:03,614
Someone's at the door.

68
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,493
Merlyn.

69
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:14,875
Merlyn, honey,
can you hear me?
Someone's at the door.

70
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:20,130
Yes, darling.
But we don't have to worry
about that no more.

71
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,850
I wanna see my sister.
Is she all right?

72
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,692
Deputy! Keep that monster
away from my boy.

73
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:29,491
You folks see me in back?

74
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:31,034
Actually, no, Sheriff.

75
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,620
Danielle, let's give
these boys some room.

76
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,164
How's the job working out, D?

77
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:37,374
I don't know
what you said...

78
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,209
but the station's offering me
a hell of a deal.

79
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:40,878
Is there any other kind?

80
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:45,716
Badge, on or off?
Off. We know who's boss.

81
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:50,220
All right, then,
the body of
Merlyn Ann Temple...

82
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,599
16-year-old child...

83
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:59,146
beautiful child,
was discovered this evening
at approximately 9:55 p.m.

84
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:03,609
Cause of death appears to be
a blunt instrument
to the head.

85
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,778
I have the sad duty
of reporting...

86
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:10,282
that the victim's father
is our prime suspect.

87
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:13,702
We have no motive
at this time,
but we do have a witness.

88
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,121
The surviving child,
Caleb Temple...

89
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,958
as he has been left
without a family...

90
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:23,962
I am hoping our community will
support me...

91
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:27,090
in shepherding him
through these dark days ahead.

92
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:29,009
Sheriff,
where is the child now?

93
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,719
We have him
safely in custody...

94
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,012
and as soon as
we're able to...

95
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,889
get an account...
Lucas.

96
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,775
It appears that
the boy was slightly injured
in the melee...

97
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:48,487
and has been taken
to the hospital.
He won't be there long.

98
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:54,284
This is Danielle Davenport,
live, News 22, from Trinity.

99
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:55,410
Back to you, Bill.

100
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:57,204
Thank you, Danielle.

101
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,807
Just wait here.
The nurse will be with you
in a minute.

102
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:34,658
Their whole family's been
troubled since the beginning.

103
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,286
Don't get me started
on her mother.

104
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:40,289
Whole family's crazy.

105
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:41,540
It's just a shame.

106
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,667
I remember when
they brought her in...

107
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,252
So sad.

108
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,545
She had two kids.

109
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:47,921
I know.

110
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:50,007
She's such
a pretty little thing.

111
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,718
Folks. Bar's closed.

112
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,355
Let's get you out of here.

113
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,952
Do you have
any other relatives in town?

114
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,498
Child welfare
talk to you yet?

115
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:28,462
Gumball?

116
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:48,190
Your hand's gonna
be fine, Caleb.

117
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:52,277
And nothing else
that happened tonight
is your fault.

118
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,781
I'm down the hall
if you need me.

119
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,908
That my sister down there?

120
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,162
Yes, it is.
I want to see her.

121
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:05,040
That's not a good idea.
Why not?

122
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:08,794
Because it won't help.
Do you know it's my birthday?

123
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,588
No, I didn't.

124
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:16,134
Well, it is, and I think
I got a right to see
my sister on my birthday.

125
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,680
Dr. Crower.

126
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:22,307
Sheriff's here.

127
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:25,769
Give me two minutes.

128
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:34,820
On whose authority
is he with you?
Hi, Sheriff.

129
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:38,448
Situations like this,
child welfare grants
the doctor in charge...

130
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,950
temporary custody.

131
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,619
These folks seen
your driving record?

132
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,040
Forgive me,
alcoholism is just
a disease now, right?

133
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:50,919
Like the common cold,
only more colorful.

134
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,176
What do you know about me?

135
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:59,678
Yankee blue blood,
Harvard Med...

136
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,849
came to town last fall,
been causing trouble
ever since.

137
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:06,852
"Let's build a new hospital,
let's clean up Goat Town...

138
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:09,938
"let's drown the poor
in biscuits and gravy."

139
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:12,649
You ain't exactly
been shy, Doctor.

140
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,528
And I thought
the Southern Sheriff
was just a cliché.

141
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:18,155
I want the boy.

142
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,992
Question him tomorrow.
This ain't about questioning,
I'm family.

143
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,077
Not according to his file.

144
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:32,002
You're a good man, aren't you?
I don't know what that means.

145
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:35,047
Anything happens
to that child, you will.

146
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,636
Caleb isn't going anywhere
until I say so.

147
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,435
You got him
till noon tomorrow.

148
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:51,021
Hey, Sheriff.

149
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,858
Drive safely.

150
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,705
Lucas,
I'm having a hard time.

151
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:10,499
That so?

152
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:19,216
You've done a lot for me,
and I figure that I owe you.

153
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:22,177
You got your lucky pen?
Yeah.

154
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:24,388
Write that down.

155
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:29,226
What I'm trying to say is...

156
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,066
I saw you.
I saw what you did
to that girl.

157
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:40,863
I didn't mean to,
I just, I thought
you might need some help...

158
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:42,239
and that's what...

159
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,580
What color is this gun?
What?

160
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:51,957
What color is the gun?
I don't...

161
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,959
The answer's as plain
as the nose on your face.

162
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:56,086
It's a gray gun.
A ray gun?

163
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,715
A gray gun, Lucas!
It's a gray gun!
That's right, Ben.

164
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:01,800
It's gray.

165
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,137
But isn't it possible
that my idea of gray...

166
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,933
and your idea of gray
might differ?

167
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:15,898
Yeah, I guess so.
All depends on
your perception, right?

168
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:23,864
Get out of the car, Ben.

169
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:27,659
Get out of the car.

170
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,299
Now, I believe...

171
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:48,514
you need a drink.

172
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:56,188
You have a bottle on me,
and while you're sipping...

173
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:59,650
you think about
what you saw tonight.

174
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:08,617
All right, Lucas,
I'll do that.

175
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:12,538
The world can be
a beautiful place, Ben.

176
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:15,916
You just got to know
how to look at it.

177
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:42,234
Fulton County Hospital,
children's ward.

178
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:51,034
Dan, can you track down
some files on Caleb Temple's
parents for me?

179
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:54,204
I'd have to
check the basement.
Great, thanks.

180
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:57,833
I hate the basement.

181
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:01,378
Have you ever been
to the basement?

182
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,589
Sorry, Caleb, but...

183
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,300
Caleb?

184
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:51,238
I'm sorry, Merlyn.
I should've been there
to protect you.

185
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,807
Caleb.

186
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:03,977
You don't need this.

187
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:28,877
You got water, pajamas,
extra blanket...

188
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:33,131
and a genuine
Elvis pillowcase.

189
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:37,803
Make you sleep like a king.

190
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:42,224
I got something else
for you, too.

191
00:19:58,657 --> 00:20:00,284
Is that your mom?

192
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:09,793
You know a lot of folks
that's died?
I guess I have.

193
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:11,879
Family?

194
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:19,303
My wife and daughter.

195
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:24,600
Where do you think
they are now?

196
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:30,022
I don't know.
I keep forgetting
they're gone.

197
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:36,236
Family stays with you, Caleb.
You think about them...

198
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:40,490
you dream about them.
That keeps them alive.

199
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:45,996
I dream about Mama a lot.

200
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:50,751
Never met her,
but made a wish
about her tonight.

201
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:54,171
A wish to have her back.

202
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:57,674
Maybe I didn't have to.

203
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:02,387
You get some sleep.

204
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:38,757
Hello, Ben.

205
00:21:40,676 --> 00:21:42,344
Conducting a raid?

206
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:51,728
I wasn't aware they allowed
law enforcement
in places like this.

207
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:54,898
I'm off-duty.

208
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:58,777
Lucky me.

209
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:02,781
Rack your balls?

210
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,960
What are you doing here,
Selena?

211
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:18,088
Trolling.

212
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:23,302
Well, you can do that
in a nicer neighborhood.

213
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,639
Well, I have certain needs
that can't be...

214
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:30,809
fulfilled uptown.

215
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:48,952
This just ain't my game.
I can see that.

216
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:54,416
Need a teacher?

217
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,530
You made this happen,
didn't you?

218
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:29,284
You make everything happen.

219
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:34,957
This document grants me
sole custody of Caleb.

220
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:39,711
And I'd like you to sign it.

221
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:44,716
I ain't signing nothing.
You care about his future?

222
00:23:57,604 --> 00:24:00,065
Too late for salvation,
my friend.

223
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,697
Not for me.

224
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:11,076
You know,
you may have a point.

225
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:17,875
You miss your wife, Gage?
She was quite a woman,
wasn't she?

226
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:22,713
Some would say a saint.
Get out of here.

227
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,549
But I guess she just wasn't
cut out for mothering.

228
00:24:25,591 --> 00:24:26,592
Get out!

229
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:30,387
So she did
the honorable thing.
She took her life.

230
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:33,265
Which spared her family
her pain...

231
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:35,809
and set her son free.

232
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:40,397
There must be
some salvation in that.

233
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:47,863
Goodbye, Gage.

234
00:25:04,922 --> 00:25:09,218
Dan said
you wanted some files.
Right, thanks.

235
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:12,804
Were you here
the night his mom died?

236
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:17,309
Yeah, right out on the floor.
What happened?

237
00:25:22,481 --> 00:25:26,443
Well,
day after Caleb was born,
she started acting crazy...

238
00:25:27,152 --> 00:25:29,655
convinced somebody was gonna
steal her baby.

239
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:31,365
We tried to
get a hold of the father...

240
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:33,242
but that little girl
was throwing a fit...

241
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:34,535
and he couldn't get away.

242
00:25:34,618 --> 00:25:35,619
Merlyn?

243
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:39,623
See, she had been
traumatized by something
earlier in the year.

244
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:43,085
Nobody knew why,
but she'd just
go off sometimes.

245
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:47,297
Caleb's mama
was kicking up such a fuss,
we had to call the Sheriff.

246
00:25:47,673 --> 00:25:52,219
And he no sooner got in
that room before she threw
herself out that window.

247
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:54,054
God.

248
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:58,851
Yeah. Course, after that,
Caleb's daddy
wasn't ever the same.

249
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:02,771
Blamed hisself.

250
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:09,486
He really blamed that girl.

251
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:14,283
Is that why the Sheriff
is so interested in Caleb?

252
00:26:16,702 --> 00:26:19,288
Lucas is interested
in everybody.

253
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,815
Caleb, wake up.

254
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,487
Caleb.

255
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:56,093
He's coming.
He's coming, Caleb.

256
00:27:57,594 --> 00:27:58,971
He's coming.

257
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:02,015
Caleb, he's coming.

258
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:04,226
Hey, Sheriff.
Evening, Wendy.

259
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:06,019
You and your husband
get into that house?

260
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:09,106
Sure did, and don't you worry,
we're gonna pay you back
as soon as...

261
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:10,774
I'm not worried.

262
00:28:34,423 --> 00:28:38,177
What part of
our earlier conversation
didn't you understand?

263
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:44,641
I was just dropping off
a present for the boy.
Heard it was his birthday.

264
00:28:46,143 --> 00:28:50,022
You can drop it
at the desk...
on your way out.

265
00:29:29,311 --> 00:29:30,896
Help me a sec.

266
00:29:32,731 --> 00:29:35,359
Caleb's mom died
from massive head injuries...

267
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,401
You ever sleep?

268
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:39,112
...but her body was filled
with puncture wounds.

269
00:29:39,196 --> 00:29:41,907
I thought you was
looking for relatives.

270
00:29:42,658 --> 00:29:44,493
Why was she so cut up?

271
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:47,204
Glass from the window.
Right.

272
00:29:47,246 --> 00:29:48,664
But if you're gonna
kill yourself...

273
00:29:48,747 --> 00:29:52,042
by jumping out of a window,
don't you open it first?

274
00:29:52,835 --> 00:29:56,004
Was the Sheriff
the only one in the room
when this happened?

275
00:29:56,088 --> 00:29:59,883
Careful, Matt.
Mr. Buck's been around here
lot longer than you have.

276
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:03,595
Excuse me, are you Dr. Crower?
Yes.

277
00:30:05,097 --> 00:30:06,640
I'm Gail Emory.

278
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:09,810
Caleb Temple's cousin.

279
00:30:13,272 --> 00:30:16,608
So when did you see him last?
Actually, we've never met.

280
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:20,571
Well, he's a great kid.
He's bright, sensitive.

281
00:30:20,612 --> 00:30:23,448
You don't have to
sell me, Doctor.
Sorry.

282
00:30:23,615 --> 00:30:26,577
It's just that you may be
all he's got left.

283
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,247
I don't mean to scare you.
No, I don't scare.

284
00:30:37,129 --> 00:30:38,964
He was up pretty late.

285
00:30:41,091 --> 00:30:42,593
Don't wake him.

286
00:30:51,143 --> 00:30:53,145
Can you come back later?

287
00:30:53,812 --> 00:30:55,147
Say, noon?

288
00:30:58,609 --> 00:30:59,818
Promise.

289
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:02,154
Okay.

290
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:47,699
Who's feeling happy today?

291
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:49,910
Me!
I am!

292
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:57,251
What's the matter, Josh?
I miss Caleb.

293
00:31:59,086 --> 00:32:01,380
Well, I'm sure we all do...

294
00:32:02,047 --> 00:32:05,759
but can't you put on
your happy face
for our special guest?

295
00:32:07,177 --> 00:32:08,679
That's better.

296
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:11,974
We're ready for you,
special guest.

297
00:32:13,684 --> 00:32:18,397
Hi, kids.
Hello, Sheriff Buck.

298
00:32:22,651 --> 00:32:26,029
I'm sure you all know about
what happened last night.

299
00:32:26,154 --> 00:32:29,074
Caleb Temple needs
our support, so...

300
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:32,911
who wants to be deputized?

301
00:32:34,204 --> 00:32:37,875
All right, then.
Miss Coombs,
may I see you in private?

302
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:46,216
How much did he tell you?

303
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:50,179
Everything.
Son of a bitch.

304
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:53,473
Where is he now?
Dropping off my car.

305
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,979
You let him drive your car?
Needed a wash.

306
00:33:01,732 --> 00:33:04,651
Well, I wasn't going to
take him to my apartment.

307
00:33:04,735 --> 00:33:06,111
How was he?

308
00:33:07,946 --> 00:33:09,072
Short.

309
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:12,826
I told you to
test his loyalty,
not his endurance.

310
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:18,123
You work your way,
I'll work mine.

311
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:23,003
Besides, that deputy
ain't your problem.
What do you mean?

312
00:33:24,713 --> 00:33:26,673
How much do you love me?

313
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:30,427
Depends.

314
00:33:34,598 --> 00:33:38,310
Caleb's cousin's in town.
What?

315
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:42,523
Little bird told me
she popped into
the hospital this morning...

316
00:33:42,606 --> 00:33:45,859
very concerned about
her kin.

317
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:47,528
Hell.

318
00:33:48,195 --> 00:33:51,573
Looks like you left some food
on your plate, darling.

319
00:33:52,783 --> 00:33:55,077
Want me to clean it up
for you?

320
00:34:06,338 --> 00:34:09,049
I'm here, Mom, Dad.

321
00:34:13,303 --> 00:34:15,514
I always wanted to come back.

322
00:34:17,182 --> 00:34:19,351
Guess I was just too afraid.

323
00:34:25,274 --> 00:34:29,736
There's a little boy here
who's in the same situation
I was.

324
00:34:33,866 --> 00:34:36,577
And he's gonna have
a lot of questions.

325
00:34:38,036 --> 00:34:40,873
Questions I don't think
that I can answer.

326
00:34:44,084 --> 00:34:46,920
Maybe if I understood
what happened to you.

327
00:34:49,965 --> 00:34:51,967
I need to know the truth.

328
00:34:54,887 --> 00:34:56,513
Please help me.

329
00:35:00,893 --> 00:35:04,062
'Cause this time,
I'm not leaving
till I find it.

330
00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:28,128
Hey, Temple,
you got a visitor.

331
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:34,968
Hi, Gage? I'm Dr. Crower,
I was wondering if I could
ask you a few questions...

332
00:35:35,052 --> 00:35:36,637
about your wife.

333
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:41,099
Gage?

334
00:35:43,644 --> 00:35:45,187
Open the door.

335
00:35:53,779 --> 00:35:54,905
Gage?

336
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:12,297
Ten-four, Healy out.

337
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:13,799
Station clear.

338
00:36:14,383 --> 00:36:17,427
Cammalous said it looked like
Gage had been dead for hours.

339
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:19,805
Probably did
the state a favor.

340
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:25,102
You got no conscience
about anything, do you?

341
00:36:27,437 --> 00:36:30,649
Conscience is just the fear
of getting caught, Ben.

342
00:36:33,986 --> 00:36:37,030
I can't be part of this
no more.
That so?

343
00:36:40,242 --> 00:36:42,327
What was that?
Problem.

344
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:54,339
Open the hood.

345
00:36:56,842 --> 00:36:59,261
Come on, Ben.
I ain't got all day.

346
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:11,190
We may have popped a hose.
Check it out.

347
00:37:12,524 --> 00:37:14,985
Why don't you
just come out here
and help me?

348
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:17,988
Because somebody's
gotta start the engine.

349
00:37:27,664 --> 00:37:31,376
What are you doing?
Get in there
and find out what's wrong.

350
00:37:32,711 --> 00:37:35,589
I don't see any hose.
Hell.

351
00:37:43,305 --> 00:37:44,723
What's this?

352
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:50,395
That's probably clogged.
Give me your pen.

353
00:37:52,105 --> 00:37:53,565
Come on, Ben.

354
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,735
Well, I can't find it.

355
00:37:57,986 --> 00:38:00,364
Your lucky pen's missing?
Yeah.

356
00:38:03,158 --> 00:38:05,077
I wonder where it went.

357
00:38:06,286 --> 00:38:07,663
Oh, my God.

358
00:38:08,664 --> 00:38:12,584
Hey, you didn't have anything
to do with Gage's death,
did you?

359
00:38:12,918 --> 00:38:17,339
No, not you.
Not my trusty deputy,
my faithful sidekick.

360
00:38:17,422 --> 00:38:20,759
You'd never do
anything like that.
You know I wouldn't!

361
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:24,137
Just because it was your pen,
your lucky, monogrammed,
platinum pen...

362
00:38:24,221 --> 00:38:26,890
that still don't mean
you did it, right?

363
00:38:27,933 --> 00:38:30,894
Now, I was with Selena Coombs
all night long.

364
00:38:31,937 --> 00:38:34,147
That sweet little
school teacher?

365
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:35,691
But I saw her today...

366
00:38:35,774 --> 00:38:39,736
and she told me she spent
a quiet evening at home
grading papers.

367
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,446
She wouldn't lie.

368
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:45,200
Why are you doing this to me?

369
00:38:51,707 --> 00:38:54,418
Just another lesson
in perception, Ben.

370
00:38:54,751 --> 00:38:57,963
All guilt is relative,
loyalty counts...

371
00:38:58,797 --> 00:39:01,758
and never let your conscience
be your guide.

372
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:09,141
You coming?

373
00:39:20,694 --> 00:39:24,072
Dr. Crower says no one
is to see the patient
until he gets back!

374
00:39:24,156 --> 00:39:25,699
Caleb, you awake?
Sheriff, please!

375
00:39:25,782 --> 00:39:28,035
What kind of drugs
they give you, boy?

376
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:34,458
Where is he?
I don't know, he's...

377
00:39:50,015 --> 00:39:51,225
Bitch.

378
00:39:53,644 --> 00:39:55,312
Did you check
the emergency room?

379
00:39:55,354 --> 00:39:57,189
Yeah, I've been all over,
Matt. He's gone.

380
00:39:57,272 --> 00:40:00,651
You have no idea
where the Sheriff went?
I don't wanna know.

381
00:40:00,692 --> 00:40:04,071
Dr. Crower, somehow I think
Caleb may have gone home.

382
00:40:06,031 --> 00:40:08,367
I should never have left
that hospital this morning.

383
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:10,619
It's not your fault.
Caleb was my responsibility.

384
00:40:10,702 --> 00:40:13,914
Let's just hope
that we find him
before Lucas Buck.

385
00:40:14,206 --> 00:40:16,124
He's the Sheriff?
Yes.

386
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:18,502
I don't know why
Caleb is so important...

387
00:40:18,544 --> 00:40:23,006
Lucas Buck is the name of
the man who found my parents
the day they died.

388
00:42:07,152 --> 00:42:08,153
Merlyn?

389
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,405
Happy birthday.

390
00:42:11,323 --> 00:42:13,825
Are you a ghost?
No.

391
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:23,502
Angel?
I'm your family.

392
00:42:24,419 --> 00:42:28,465
You're talking.
In life, you were my voice...

393
00:42:29,174 --> 00:42:31,176
and now you must hear me.

394
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:36,557
Your father's coming.
But I thought he was in...

395
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,643
You have the locket?
Yes.

396
00:42:40,686 --> 00:42:43,313
Open it.
Why?

397
00:42:43,856 --> 00:42:46,692
Because you need
to know the truth, Caleb.

398
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:53,115
Open the locket.

399
00:42:58,704 --> 00:43:00,289
Now turn around.

400
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:07,838
"...until finally,
the wolf arrived at
the grandmother's house."

401
00:43:07,921 --> 00:43:11,466
Is that where Daddy is?
Daddy will be home soon,
Merlyn.

402
00:43:11,675 --> 00:43:15,721
"Now, when he got to
the front door, the wolf
looked into the forest...

403
00:43:15,846 --> 00:43:18,056
"to make sure
that no one had seen
him coming"...

404
00:43:26,857 --> 00:43:28,358
Hello, darling, mother here?

405
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:32,196
Mama. Someone's at the door.

406
00:43:33,989 --> 00:43:37,159
What do you want here?
You know what I want.

407
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:39,077
We talked about it.

408
00:43:39,161 --> 00:43:42,206
Now, I've told you
that you should
stay away from me.

409
00:43:42,247 --> 00:43:43,582
This isn't about you.

410
00:43:43,665 --> 00:43:46,752
Please,
just stay away from me.
It's about me.

411
00:43:47,252 --> 00:43:49,671
It's about family.
Please.

412
00:43:52,132 --> 00:43:53,175
No!

413
00:43:59,598 --> 00:44:00,599
No!

414
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:06,313
Why?

415
00:44:08,106 --> 00:44:10,943
Because you need
to know the truth, Caleb.

416
00:44:14,696 --> 00:44:18,617
Be careful, Caleb.
Someone's at the door.

417
00:44:30,003 --> 00:44:31,797
No more running, son.

418
00:44:50,732 --> 00:44:55,070
Look here, boy.
There's only two roads
in this world...

419
00:44:55,279 --> 00:44:58,156
and if you're listening
to anyone but me...

420
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,200
you're on the wrong one.

421
00:45:05,914 --> 00:45:07,457
That's his car.

422
00:45:17,676 --> 00:45:20,304
Caleb,
you're gonna have to trust me.

423
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:26,685
That's good liquor
you're wasting there, son.

424
00:45:26,727 --> 00:45:29,479
I ain't your son!
I beg to differ.

425
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:43,577
Where's Caleb?
Where is he?

426
00:45:43,827 --> 00:45:44,953
Where is he?

427
00:45:51,376 --> 00:45:52,961
Where's the boy?

428
00:45:58,383 --> 00:46:00,219
I know who you are!

429
00:46:02,888 --> 00:46:04,556
Caleb!

430
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,685
Caleb!

431
00:46:11,021 --> 00:46:12,898
Caleb!
