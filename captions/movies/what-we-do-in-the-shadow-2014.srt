that you have not done

00:05:46,951 --> 00:05:51,534
one day I was selling my wares,

87

this old creepy castle.

flies at me!

back to this dark dungeon

and bit into my neck.

93

And just at the point of death,

94
00:06:11,243 --> 00:06:16,077
this creature forced me
to suck its foul blood.

95
00:06:16,202 --> 00:06:19,618
And then, it opened its wings
like this

96
00:06:19,743 --> 00:06:22,952

screeching.

VIAGO: Vlad, you were great.

102
00:06:36,244 --> 00:06:40,203
You put out the recycling,
which was really cool.

103
00:06:40,327 --> 00:06:44,578
And the other day, I dragged
a man's body down the hallway

104
00:06:44,703 --> 00:06:48,453
and noticed
that there was no dust.

105

I kind of swept the hallway.

in the medieval times.

790
00:41:08,692 --> 00:41:10,817
The movie "Twilight"...
Have you seen it?

791
00:41:10,942 --> 00:41:11,817
- WOMAN: Yeah.
- Okay.

792
00:41:11,942 --> 00:41:13,442
I'm the main guy in "Twilight."

793
00:41:13,567 --> 00:41:15,859
You know the main guy?
"Twilight"?

794
00:41:15,984 --> 00:41:18,276
That's me. There's cameras
following me around.

795
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,599
They could have chosen anyone.

796
00:41:19,651 --> 00:41:21,930
VLADISLAV: How many people
have you told you're a vampire?

797
00:41:21,984 --> 00:41:23,901
- Not many.
- I heard that girl

798
00:41:24,026 --> 00:41:25,109
talking about it.

799
00:41:25,234 --> 00:41:26,901
She said you're a vampire.

800
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,025
Yeah. I told her.

801
00:41:28,109 --> 00:41:29,544
- VIAGO: Who else?
- Who did you tell?

802
00:41:29,568 --> 00:41:31,234
Uh, I told her hot friend.

803
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,984
You can't tell everyone that
you're [Whispering] a vampire.

804
00:41:34,109 --> 00:41:36,127
- VIAGO: Who's that guy?
- I don't know, but I trust him.

805
00:41:36,151 --> 00:41:37,026
Oh!

806
00:41:37,151 --> 00:41:39,652
- You can't tell everyone.
- All right. I won't.

807
00:41:39,777 --> 00:41:42,860
- I'm a vampire!
- [Crowd cheering]

808
00:41:42,985 --> 00:41:44,401
Vampire!

809
00:41:44,526 --> 00:41:46,485
Yeah, I've got a bit
of an eye condition.

810
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:47,652
What's wrong with them?

811
00:41:47,777 --> 00:41:50,526
Uh, vampire eyes.
Can't go into the sun.

812
00:41:50,652 --> 00:41:53,069
WOMAN: Oh, my God.
Are they your fangs?

813
00:41:53,194 --> 00:41:54,069
For real?

814
00:41:54,194 --> 00:41:55,444
For real real.

815
00:41:55,569 --> 00:41:56,943
Too real, real.

816
00:41:57,069 --> 00:41:57,943
I'm a vampire, though.

817
00:41:58,069 --> 00:41:59,860
- You're a vampire?
- Yeah.

818
00:41:59,985 --> 00:42:02,736
- I'm a vampire hunter, man.
- [Laughs] No, you're not.

819
00:42:02,861 --> 00:42:04,653
- I am.
- Fucking piece of shit.

820
00:42:04,778 --> 00:42:06,194
I'll Skype you.

821
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,152
I can float.
I can transform into stuff.

822
00:42:08,277 --> 00:42:10,111
- Same.
- No, you can't.

823
00:42:10,235 --> 00:42:13,070
Yeah.
I'll show you. Whoo!

824
00:42:13,195 --> 00:42:15,046
You show me. Show me some
of your vampire stuff.

825
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:16,153
What have I got?
Um...

826
00:42:16,278 --> 00:42:18,944
[Hisses]

827
00:42:22,028 --> 00:42:24,903
Don't lie
about transforming into shit.

828
00:42:31,236 --> 00:42:34,029
- "Twilight"!
- Shut up, Nick!

829
00:42:34,153 --> 00:42:35,362
You're not "Twilight."

830
00:42:35,487 --> 00:42:37,695
- What's your problem?
- You are my problem.

831
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,779
Telling the world
that we are vampires.

832
00:42:39,904 --> 00:42:41,755
And I'll tell the whole world
that you're an asshole now.

833
00:42:41,779 --> 00:42:43,695
Shut up!

834
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:44,921
- You shut up!
- VIAGO: Guys!

835
00:42:44,945 --> 00:42:45,963
- You shut up!
- No. You shut up!

836
00:42:45,987 --> 00:42:47,612
- No. You shut up!
- You shut up!

837
00:42:47,737 --> 00:42:49,571
- I'm Dracula, man!
- You're not Dracula!

838
00:42:49,695 --> 00:42:51,446
You don't even know
who Dracula is!

839
00:42:51,571 --> 00:42:52,571
You idiot!

[Bat screeching]

Aw, Deacon!

847
00:43:09,571 --> 00:43:11,363
That wasn't fair, man.

848
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:12,696
My fucking jacket, man!

849
00:43:12,821 --> 00:43:15,030
I don't care
about your stupid jacket.

850
00:43:16,613 --> 00:43:19,530
- VIAGO: Deacon!
- STU: You okay, man?

851
00:43:35,489 --> 00:43:37,114
- Hey, Stu.
- Mm-hmm?

852
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,614
How's your worms?

853
00:43:41,156 --> 00:43:44,281
- What?
- You're eating worms.

854
00:43:48,406 --> 00:43:50,989
Can you do that shit
where you turn it into worms?

855
00:43:51,114 --> 00:43:53,531
- No.
- It doesn't work on chips.

856
00:43:53,657 --> 00:43:56,573
Only works on things
that already look like worms.

857
00:43:56,698 --> 00:43:58,406
Maybe noodles.
Do you want some noodles?

858
00:43:58,531 --> 00:44:00,156
But he knows now.

859
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:03,907
Oh, no.
I wouldn't eat that.

860
00:44:06,365 --> 00:44:08,157
Why?

861
00:44:17,823 --> 00:44:19,115
VLADISLAV:
Are you okay, Nick?

862

All right?

864
00:44:28,366 --> 00:44:30,075
He ate a chip.

865
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:32,033
I can't eat solids now.
Great.

866
00:44:32,158 --> 00:44:35,033
What, I can't sunbathe.
I can't watch daytime TV.

867
00:44:35,158 --> 00:44:37,283
I can if... Oh, yeah.
I guess I could.

868
00:44:37,407 --> 00:44:39,200
More then anything,
it's just the chips.

869
00:44:39,325 --> 00:44:41,866
It's my favorite food.
I can't eat chips.

870
00:44:42,492 --> 00:44:44,783
I don't... It's just I hate...

871
00:44:44,908 --> 00:44:46,387
I'll say it.
I'm over being a vampire.

872
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:47,575
It's shit.

873
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,075
So don't believe the hype.

- Hello, children!

- Don't look at the man.
- Hey, little children.

JACKIE:
Natasha, don't look at the man.

882
00:45:19,159 --> 00:45:21,201
I was going to bite you tonight.

883
00:45:21,326 --> 00:45:22,576
- Really?
- But now I can't

884
00:45:22,701 --> 00:45:25,076
because there's this Nick
being a vampire.

885
00:45:25,201 --> 00:45:27,077
Sorry. I thought
you killed him two months ago.

886
00:45:27,201 --> 00:45:28,993
No, I didn't
No. He's a vampire.

887
00:45:29,118 --> 00:45:30,242
What do you mean?

888
00:45:30,368 --> 00:45:31,993
He jumped
in front of your place.

889
00:45:33,368 --> 00:45:36,285
All I'm saying is that, um...

890
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:38,011
you know, if I had a penis,
I would have been...

891
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:40,035
I would have been bitten
years ago.

892
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,035
I may have to penalize you.

893
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,535
Perhaps another couple of years.

894
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:46,577
Perhaps 10 years.
Hmm?

895
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:49,243
Like one big circle,
just biting each other's dicks.

896
00:45:49,369 --> 00:45:51,386
You know, they don't even wear
shirts, They wear blouses.

please.

She was everything I wanted.

906
00:46:30,745 --> 00:46:33,703
Unfortunately, ja,
she was married.

907
00:46:34,787 --> 00:46:36,912
Sure, I wanted to kill the guy.

908
00:46:37,037 --> 00:46:39,287
I thought about
chopping his head off...

909
00:46:39,412 --> 00:46:42,912
draining him of every drop
of blood that he had.

Who wouldn't?

911

But then, I also saw
how happy she was.

912
00:46:49,996 --> 00:46:52,996
And that made me kind of happy.

913
00:46:53,121 --> 00:46:55,621
And I didn't want to ruin it
for her, so...

[Gagging]
Crucifix!

947
00:48:56,125 --> 00:48:57,541
Cover the crucifix!

948
00:48:57,667 --> 00:48:59,209
[Gagging]

949
00:49:00,459 --> 00:49:04,459
And then
Petyr has burst from the tomb,

950
00:49:04,584 --> 00:49:08,042
pushed the tomb lid
onto the vampire hunter.

951
00:49:08,167 --> 00:49:10,542
And then the sunlight
has come through here

952
00:49:10,668 --> 00:49:13,292
and burned Petyr alive.

953
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:16,584
I think this is just a table
leg, which is sanded down.

954
00:49:16,709 --> 00:49:17,852
Do you think
he hand-sanded that?

955
00:49:17,876 --> 00:49:20,126
Yes.
Image that stuck in your...

956
00:49:20,251 --> 00:49:21,501
VLADISLAV: Ooh.

957
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:23,584
VIAGO: It's quite shocking
down here, Nick.

958
00:49:23,709 --> 00:49:26,668
Look.
Here's our sweet Petyr.

959
00:49:26,793 --> 00:49:29,126
- NICK: Fuck, yeah.
- VIAGO: Burnt to a sizzle.

960
00:49:29,251 --> 00:49:30,394
VLADISLAV:
I can't figure out this.

961
00:49:30,418 --> 00:49:33,251
- This is the vampire hunter.
- Oh, who's this guy?

962
00:49:33,377 --> 00:49:36,001
Look at his bloody head on
back to front.

963
00:49:36,126 --> 00:49:37,752
Twist it the other way.
The other way.

964
00:49:37,877 --> 00:49:39,475
- This way.
- VIAGO: See who this guy is.

965
00:49:39,502 --> 00:49:41,418
VLADISLAV: [Groans]

966
00:49:42,044 --> 00:49:44,835
- Hmm. Typical macho type.
- VIAGO: Yuck.

967
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,169
- VLADISLAV: Hideous.
- NICK: Oh, shit.

968
00:49:48,127 --> 00:49:49,919
I know that guy actually.

969
00:49:50,044 --> 00:49:51,169
VLADISLAV: You know him?

970
00:49:51,294 --> 00:49:52,627
- Yeah.
- VIAGO: What?

971
00:49:52,752 --> 00:49:54,960
I saw him
the other night in town.

972
00:49:55,086 --> 00:49:56,835
- Told him I was a vampire.
- VIAGO: What?!

973
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,062
I thought he was joking.
He said he was a vampire hunter.

974
00:49:59,086 --> 00:50:00,960
You let a vampire hunter
into our house?

975
00:50:01,086 --> 00:50:02,687
I didn't let him in.
I just gave him my e-mail.

976
00:50:02,711 --> 00:50:04,378
VIAGO: Nick!

977
00:50:04,503 --> 00:50:07,503
I will tear out your tongue
and shove it down your ass!

978
00:50:07,628 --> 00:50:08,711
VIAGO: Guys!

979
00:50:08,836 --> 00:50:10,419
[indistinct shouting]

980
00:50:13,128 --> 00:50:14,920
I'm gonna kill you!

981

- [Door opens]
- [Growls]

982
00:50:21,503 --> 00:50:23,878
Tear out your tongue!

983
00:50:25,253 --> 00:50:27,711
You killed Petyr
with your big mouth!

984
00:50:28,462 --> 00:50:29,461
NICK: It was a mistake!

985
00:50:29,545 --> 00:50:30,836
- Get up.
- NICK: Take a breath.

986
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:33,420
Get up and stand on this ceiling
like a man.

987
00:50:33,545 --> 00:50:35,545
[Snarls]

988
00:50:39,004 --> 00:50:41,379
- [Hisses]
- We can talk about this, okay?

989
00:50:41,504 --> 00:50:43,262
- We can talk about it.
- I'm gonna kill you!

990
00:50:43,379 --> 00:50:44,462
I'm already dead!

991
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:46,504
Stu, stay back!

992
00:50:47,629 --> 00:50:49,421
DEACON: [Growls]

993
00:50:49,545 --> 00:50:51,344
- [Knock on door]
- VLADISLAV: Shh, shh, shh!

994
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:52,730
- There's someone at the door.
- Shh.

995
00:50:52,754 --> 00:50:54,296
I'll go. I'll go.

996
00:50:57,505 --> 00:50:58,879
DEACON: [Hisses]

997
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:04,004
Oh, shit.

998
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,797
- Yeah, good evening, sir.
- Hello, police.

999
00:51:06,922 --> 00:51:09,380
Hi. I'm Constable O'Leary.
This is Constable Minogue.

1000
00:51:09,505 --> 00:51:10,784
We're just responding
to a report

1001
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,380
of a possible forced entry

1002
00:51:12,505 --> 00:51:14,880
and also a rather large amount
of shrieking.

1003
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:16,481
Just, um, wondering
if maybe we could come in,

1004
00:51:16,505 --> 00:51:17,381
just have a wee look around?

1005
00:51:17,505 --> 00:51:19,422
Okay.

1006
00:51:19,546 --> 00:51:21,672
What's with the fellow?
What's with the camera?

1007
00:51:21,797 --> 00:51:23,939
Yeah, we're obviously just here
'cause there was a phone call

1008
00:51:23,963 --> 00:51:26,714
from a member of the public
about a bit of disturbance.

1009
00:51:26,838 --> 00:51:28,547
Um, some loud noises.

1010
00:51:28,673 --> 00:51:30,339
Possibly a forced entry,
wasn't there?

1011
00:51:30,464 --> 00:51:32,381
And, also,
maybe a bit of smoke coming out.

1012
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:33,940
So we're just
checking over the scene,

1013
00:51:33,964 --> 00:51:36,673
making sure everything's, you
know, aboveboard, so to speak,

1014
00:51:36,798 --> 00:51:39,339
and making sure no one's in
danger, that kind of thing.

1015
00:51:39,464 --> 00:51:40,815
We might go up
and have a wee look up there,

1016
00:51:40,839 --> 00:51:42,589
if that's all right with you.

1017
00:51:42,714 --> 00:51:44,256
Come on, mate.
You lead the way.

1018
00:51:44,382 --> 00:51:45,923
Yeah.

1019
00:51:46,048 --> 00:51:47,215
Okay.

1020
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:48,839
Smells a bit weird in here,
too, mate.

1021
00:51:48,964 --> 00:51:50,964
- Yeah.
- What do you call that?

1022
00:51:52,507 --> 00:51:54,715
Barbecue.

1023
00:51:56,964 --> 00:52:00,465
You will not notice
anything out of the ordinary.

1024
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:02,428
- DEACON: [Growls]
- No. We certainly hope not.

1025
00:52:02,507 --> 00:52:04,091
Let's just keep going up.

1026
00:52:04,215 --> 00:52:05,965
Yeah. Hi, there, guys.
How are you?

1027
00:52:06,091 --> 00:52:07,965
- Hello.
- MINOGUE: Hey, fellas.

1028
00:52:08,091 --> 00:52:09,775
O'LEARY: ls this the room
we've heard all the shouting

1029
00:52:09,799 --> 00:52:12,174
- coming from?
- DEACON: That was me.

1030
00:52:12,299 --> 00:52:14,091
Yeah, okay. We've had
a couple reports, okay?

1031
00:52:14,216 --> 00:52:15,233
There's couple people
not that happy

1032
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:18,549
- about the level of noise here.
- Okay. The neighbors?

1033
00:52:18,674 --> 00:52:20,508
You've got neighbors
on either side.

1034
00:52:20,633 --> 00:52:23,424
[Whispering] Really nervous.
I've hypnotized those cops.

1035
00:52:23,549 --> 00:52:27,091
I'm not a great hypnotizer,
so it could wear off any second.

1036
00:52:27,216 --> 00:52:29,758
I really hope that those guys
don't kill those police

1037
00:52:29,883 --> 00:52:31,758
because it will mean
more police will come.

1038
00:52:31,883 --> 00:52:33,341
Possibly even Christians,

1039
00:52:33,466 --> 00:52:35,966
which is totally the last thing
we need in this house.

1040
00:52:36,092 --> 00:52:37,716
I can see
you're having a good time.

1041
00:52:37,841 --> 00:52:40,092
End of the day,
we got to keep the peace, okay?

1042
00:52:40,217 --> 00:52:42,591
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1043
00:52:42,716 --> 00:52:43,841
See what I'm seeing?

1044
00:52:43,966 --> 00:52:46,384
What's that, Minogue?

1045
00:52:46,509 --> 00:52:47,509
You're joking.

1046
00:52:48,716 --> 00:52:50,342
Not a smoke alarm in sight.

1047
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:52,175
MINOGUE:
No smoke detectors, mate.

1048
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:55,342
Rule number one...
smoke detectors.

1049
00:52:55,467 --> 00:52:56,485
- Okay.
- O'LEARY: Rule number 2...

1050
00:52:56,509 --> 00:52:58,634
maybe not
so many barbecues inside.

1051
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:00,550
- MINOGUE: Sort it out, fellas.
- Okay.

1052
00:53:00,676 --> 00:53:02,714
Barbecue smells really strong
down here, doesn't it?

1053
00:53:02,801 --> 00:53:03,860
- What kind of marinade?
- Yeah.

1054
00:53:03,884 --> 00:53:04,884
O'LEARY: Who's this guy?

1055
00:53:06,009 --> 00:53:09,926
Um... it's a friend
who came to our party.

1056
00:53:10,051 --> 00:53:11,385
Mate, are you right?

1057
00:53:11,509 --> 00:53:12,652
- He's drunk.
- That's what I thought.

1058
00:53:12,676 --> 00:53:13,676
- Drunk guy.
- Yeah.

1059
00:53:13,801 --> 00:53:16,259
Look, you can't just leave him
down here like that, okay?

1060
00:53:16,385 --> 00:53:17,967
This guy's
not having a good time.

1061
00:53:18,093 --> 00:53:19,884
He's gonna feel terrible
tomorrow morning.

1062
00:53:20,009 --> 00:53:21,593
Well, he's soul is in hell.

1063
00:53:21,718 --> 00:53:22,985
Well, I don't know
where's his soul is,

1064
00:53:23,009 --> 00:53:24,736
but all I'm saying is,
"Where's his blanket?"

1065
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,760
There's a big slab of concrete
on him. Could move that.

1066
00:53:27,885 --> 00:53:29,319
O'LEARY: That's definitely not
gonna be comfortable.

1067
00:53:29,343 --> 00:53:31,861
- Anything else in here, Minogue?
- No. I think I've seen enough.

1068
00:53:31,885 --> 00:53:33,802
- Okay.
- Hang on a minute.

1069
00:53:33,927 --> 00:53:34,968
What have we got here?

1070
00:53:36,593 --> 00:53:37,736
- O'LEARY: What is that?
- VIAGO: This?

1071
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:38,927
- This.
- Oh. This.

1072
00:53:39,052 --> 00:53:40,718
You can see it as clearly
as I can.

1073
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:43,010
Adhesive, mate.
That's a flammable.

1074
00:53:43,135 --> 00:53:44,968
Then you got a lamp
on top of that.

1075
00:53:45,094 --> 00:53:46,968
Directly underneath
the power source.

1076
00:53:47,094 --> 00:53:49,260
- That is quite bad, guys.
- It's very bad.

1077
00:53:49,386 --> 00:53:50,968
And no smoke detectors again,
are there?

1078
00:53:51,094 --> 00:53:52,968
- No.
- Yes, there are.

1079
00:53:53,094 --> 00:53:55,219
- Yes, there are.
I see them, yeah. That's good.

1080
00:53:55,344 --> 00:53:56,528
VIAGO:
Lots to think about, guys.

1081
00:53:56,552 --> 00:53:57,886
Yeah.
Lots to think about.

1082
00:53:58,011 --> 00:54:00,011
- Next flat meeting, ja?
- Yeah. Good thinking.

1083
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:02,071
That's the thing. Just have
a bit of dialogue about it.

1084
00:54:02,095 --> 00:54:04,594
Okay.
They've got a really good point.

1085
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:06,678
Wait.
Let's kill them.

1086
00:54:06,803 --> 00:54:09,387
Well, let's just see what
other safety points they have,

1087
00:54:09,511 --> 00:54:12,136
and then maybe we'll kill them.

1088
00:54:19,886 --> 00:54:25,804
I call into session this trial
of Nick of Wellington.

1089
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:29,679
VIAGO: [Clears throat]

1090
00:54:29,804 --> 00:54:32,387
VLADISLAV: Read the charges.

1091
00:54:32,512 --> 00:54:35,262
"Problems we have with Nick."

1092
00:54:35,388 --> 00:54:38,804
Number one... You brought
a human into our house,

1093
00:54:38,929 --> 00:54:40,887
which is a big no-no
in the vampire world.

1094
00:54:41,012 --> 00:54:43,179
- Stu is okay, though.
- Yeah. Stu is fine.

1095
00:54:43,304 --> 00:54:46,096
So I guess we'll just
cross that one out.

1096
00:54:46,221 --> 00:54:47,970
Uh...

1097
00:54:50,638 --> 00:54:52,471
- Thank you, Stu.
- VLADISLAV: Thank you, Stu.

1098
00:54:52,596 --> 00:54:55,055
So... the new number one...

1099
00:54:55,179 --> 00:54:57,846
Nick's been telling people
he's a vampire.

1100
00:54:57,971 --> 00:55:02,180
That, in turn, resulted
in an unwanted visit

1101
00:55:02,305 --> 00:55:03,763
from a vampire hunter.

1102
00:55:03,888 --> 00:55:07,805
Crime number two...
This is quite a biggie, Nick...

1103
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:10,639
the vampire hunter
who killed Petyr.

1104
00:55:10,763 --> 00:55:12,222
<i>Oh.</i>

1105
00:55:12,347 --> 00:55:14,846
That actually should have been
crime number one,

1106
00:55:14,971 --> 00:55:17,055
but we wanted to build up
to that.

1107
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:19,138
Number three...
Deacon doesn't like

1108
00:55:19,263 --> 00:55:21,931
that you wear
the same jacket as him.

1109
00:55:22,056 --> 00:55:25,889
And he would like you to find
your own original style.

1110
00:55:26,014 --> 00:55:30,139
For these crimes of which
we, the vampire council,

1111
00:55:30,264 --> 00:55:31,263
find you guilty,

1112
00:55:31,348 --> 00:55:35,473
you should be banished
from our flat indefinitely.

1113
00:55:35,597 --> 00:55:37,473
- Indefinitely.
- Indefinitely.

1114
00:55:37,598 --> 00:55:39,366
- So I can come back one day?
- DEACON: No, no.

1115
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:41,889
"Indefinitely" means
there is no end.

1116
00:55:42,014 --> 00:55:42,889
I thought it was like...

1117
00:55:43,014 --> 00:55:45,848
"Indefinite" means
that it's not a definite thing.

1118
00:55:45,972 --> 00:55:47,449
- It can be changed.
- Yes, but it's long.

1119
00:55:47,473 --> 00:55:48,992
Could be tomorrow.
Could be six months.

1120
00:55:49,056 --> 00:55:50,640
DEACON: No!
It is not tomorrow!

1121
00:55:50,765 --> 00:55:52,515
Forget about it.
You're banished.

1122
00:55:52,598 --> 00:55:53,597
You're banished.

1123
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,598
But, Stu,
you can visit if you like.

1124
00:55:55,723 --> 00:55:57,306
Thank you.

1125
00:55:57,431 --> 00:55:59,057
DEACON: For your crimes...

1126
00:55:59,182 --> 00:56:03,682
you will be made to suffer
the Procession of Shame.

1127
00:56:03,807 --> 00:56:04,806
I asked them, Nick.

1128
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:06,723
I asked them
not to pass that sentence.

1129
00:56:06,848 --> 00:56:09,265
We should do this immediately,
in my opinion.

1130
00:56:09,391 --> 00:56:13,432
You didn't ask. You didn't ask.
You were saying yes.

1131
00:56:13,557 --> 00:56:16,474
VIAGO: [Breathes deeply]

1132
00:56:16,599 --> 00:56:20,474
I didn't, but I still think
it's quite extreme.

1133
00:56:20,599 --> 00:56:24,808
Let us do
the Procession of Shame now.

1134
00:56:26,891 --> 00:56:28,474
- Shame.
- Shame, shame.

1135
00:56:28,557 --> 00:56:29,808
- Shame.
- Shame!

1136
00:56:29,933 --> 00:56:32,225
- Shame!
- Bad vampire!

1137
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:33,891
Shame.

1138
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:36,517
Shall we go, Stu?

1139
00:56:41,141 --> 00:56:43,100
[Whispering] Bye, Stu.

1140
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:48,266
[Gate creaks]

1141
00:56:59,142 --> 00:57:01,850
VLADISLAV:
That was a shame.

1142
00:57:11,476 --> 00:57:13,601
[Sighs]

1143
00:57:24,643 --> 00:57:28,268
DEACON:
So, today we have an invitation

1144
00:57:28,394 --> 00:57:30,560
to the big event of the year.

1145
00:57:30,685 --> 00:57:33,185
VIAGO: Breaking it open.

1146
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:34,810
DEACON:
They have burnt the edges.

1147
00:57:34,935 --> 00:57:36,494
VIAGO: Like a treasure map
or something.

1148
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,560
VLADISLAV: It looks
very authentic, doesn't it?

1149
00:57:38,686 --> 00:57:40,894
"Dearly departed..."

1150
00:57:41,018 --> 00:57:42,644
That's us.

1151
00:57:42,769 --> 00:57:44,811
"The Wellington
Vampire Association

1152
00:57:44,936 --> 00:57:48,019
in conjunction with the
Lower Hutt Vampire Witch Club

1153
00:57:48,144 --> 00:57:50,811
and the Karori Zombie Society

1154
00:57:50,936 --> 00:57:54,353
invite you to attend
The Unholy Masquerade

1155
00:57:54,477 --> 00:58:01,727
on the night of the 6th of June
starting at 6:00 p.m."

1156
00:58:01,852 --> 00:58:04,311
- 666.
- Oh, yeah.

1157
00:58:04,436 --> 00:58:06,977
The Unholy Masquerade,
of course, is a great time

1158
00:58:07,103 --> 00:58:09,019
for the undead community
of Wellington.

1159
00:58:09,144 --> 00:58:13,062
There's zombies there,
vampires, banshees...

1160
00:58:13,186 --> 00:58:15,353
all having a dance together.

1161
00:58:15,478 --> 00:58:18,145
It's always a big deal for me.
Love it.

1162
00:58:18,269 --> 00:58:20,770
One year I went
to The Unholy Masquerade

1163
00:58:20,895 --> 00:58:25,895
dressed as Whoopi Goldberg
from "Sister Act 1"

1164
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:28,396
and "Sister Act 2:
Back in the Habit."

1165
00:58:28,521 --> 00:58:31,270
Didn't go down so well
because she was a nun.

1166
00:58:31,396 --> 00:58:33,145
[Chuckles]

1167
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:35,771
Vampires don't like nuns.

1168
00:58:35,895 --> 00:58:38,270
VLADISLAV: Of course, the big
deal of The Unholy Masquerade

1169
00:58:38,396 --> 00:58:40,854
is every year they
announce the guest of honor.

1170
00:58:40,979 --> 00:58:42,813
And, um...

1171
00:58:42,938 --> 00:58:45,938
I don't know if I should be
saying this, but...

1172
00:58:46,063 --> 00:58:51,896
I heard a little rumor that
the guest of honor this year

1173
00:58:52,021 --> 00:58:54,355
might be me.

1174
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,771
DEACON: The location...

1175
00:58:55,896 --> 00:58:57,175
VLADISLAV:
Oh, yeah. Where is it?

1176
00:58:57,230 --> 00:58:59,605
- Oh, the location.
- The Cathedral of Despair.

1177
00:58:59,729 --> 00:59:02,480
And the guest of honor
will be...

1178
00:59:05,647 --> 00:59:08,230
Who is it? Show me.

1179
00:59:11,814 --> 00:59:13,689
[Breathes deeply]

1180
00:59:13,814 --> 00:59:15,605
Hmm.

1181
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:18,356
[Breathes deeply]
Okay.

1182
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,605
Okay. Okay.

1183
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:23,730
- Okay, that's fine. That's fine.
- Okay?

1184
00:59:23,855 --> 00:59:26,523
VLADISLAV: [Screams]
I can't believe it!

1185
00:59:26,648 --> 00:59:28,147
[Pounding]

1186
00:59:28,272 --> 00:59:35,773
Uh, Vladislav has just had
a reaction to the information

1187
00:59:35,898 --> 00:59:38,398
that the guest of honor
will be, um...

1188
00:59:38,523 --> 00:59:40,147
- VLADISLAV: [Screaming]
- ...The Beast.

1189
00:59:43,606 --> 00:59:47,731
The darkest part of my mind
is reserved for The Beast.

1190
00:59:47,856 --> 00:59:49,666
We could tell you a thing
or two about The Beast.

1191
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:52,399
You should pray that you
never have to see The Beast.

1192
00:59:52,524 --> 00:59:53,981
This one is called "The Beast."

1193
00:59:54,107 --> 00:59:57,440
And I said, "Get you hands
off my balls, Beast!"

1194
00:59:57,565 --> 00:59:59,065
He may have told you
some stories

1195
00:59:59,190 --> 01:00:01,524
about his great battle
with The Beast.

1196
01:00:01,649 --> 01:00:04,023
Yeah. "Oh, I fought The Beast
on a cliff."

1197
01:00:04,148 --> 01:00:06,357
"Oh, I fought The Beast
in a swamp."

1198
01:00:06,482 --> 01:00:07,357
DEACON: Mm-hmm.

1199
01:00:07,482 --> 01:00:11,108
"One time I fought The Beast
in the toilets of a nightclub."

1200
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:12,816
Difficult battle.

1201
01:00:12,941 --> 01:00:16,108
I hope you never see The Beast.

1202
01:00:16,233 --> 01:00:19,149
The Beast.

1203
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:29,441
You can't go to the ball
as Blade.

1204
01:00:29,566 --> 01:00:30,982
He's a vampire hunter.

1205
01:00:31,108 --> 01:00:33,108
VIAGO: Yeah, but vampires
love Wesley Snipes.

1206
01:00:33,233 --> 01:00:34,858
No. It's inappropriate.

1207
01:00:34,983 --> 01:00:36,858
Okay, Vlad.
The green jodhpurs

1208
01:00:36,983 --> 01:00:39,400
or the black leather
with the dragon belt?

1209
01:00:39,525 --> 01:00:41,210
VLADISLAV: Just wear the pants
you're going to wear.

1210
01:00:41,234 --> 01:00:42,334
Which pants do you want to wear?

1211
01:00:42,358 --> 01:00:44,584
Just look at the pants, Vlad.
Turn around and look at them.

1212
01:00:44,608 --> 01:00:45,692
They're just pants!

1213
01:00:45,817 --> 01:00:47,484
- Shit, man.
- Holy shit!

1214
01:00:47,608 --> 01:00:49,234
VIAGO:
Oh, you look terrible.

1215
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:50,526
The black pants.

1216
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:52,442
Thank you.
Get dressed.

1217
01:00:52,567 --> 01:00:54,442
I don't know
if I feel up to it, really.

1218
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:57,275
You don't look that great, but
if you eat someone on the way

and rejuvenate a little bit...

1220
01:00:58,442 --> 01:01:00,526
You could probably wear
a mask or something.

1221
01:01:00,651 --> 01:01:03,984
Just leave me to do
my dark bidding on the Internet!

What are you bidding on?

01:01:05,651 --> 01:01:07,776
I'm bidding on a table.

- Not.

- Hello.
- Hi.

1229
01:01:30,777 --> 01:01:33,568
We tend to often...
without getting into that...

1230
01:01:33,694 --> 01:01:36,318
kind of [Moaning] stuff,
which I'm really sick of that,

1231
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:37,944
but, you know, it's just,

1232
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:40,944
it's harder for us
to actually chase people down.

1233
01:01:41,069 --> 01:01:45,152
Can I introduce Gary and Alicia?

1234

- [Gary and Alicia groaning]
- Hi. How are you?

1235

- Hi.
- [Groaning continues]

1236

Less groaning.
Less groaning, guys.

1237
01:01:53,069 --> 01:01:55,486
So, we're
at The Unholy Masquerade.

1238

It's great.

Pretty rude,
because she was my servant.

1253

She was
a pretty useless servant.

Yes, but, still, I would have
appreciated if you'd asked.

How's Stu?

1256

He's good.
He's here.

Yes.

We're raffling a live meat pack

You can inspect the prize
over here to my left.

It's a wonderful prize.

The Beast is the name I give
to my ex-girlfriend Pauline.

1280
01:03:35,281 --> 01:03:37,365
She prefers Pauline.

1281
01:03:37,490 --> 01:03:40,073
We had
a very intense relationship.

1282
01:03:40,198 --> 01:03:43,657
We were very sexually explosive.

1283
01:03:43,781 --> 01:03:48,906
Last time I saw her, she impaled
me and called me an asshole.

1284
01:03:49,031 --> 01:03:53,032
She said all kinds of things
that really hurt me.

1285
01:03:53,156 --> 01:03:56,907
And all this while
I was impaled on a lamppost!

1286
01:03:57,032 --> 01:04:00,407
Well, everyone,
I will be mingling around,

1287

and I really hope that...

1288
01:04:02,949 --> 01:04:05,241
I will meet...

That's the new guy.

01:04:25,324 --> 01:04:28,033
Do you know
what kind of vampire he is...

- This is Stu, our friend.
- Stu?

G'day, Stu.
How are you, mate?

Are you a demon?

No, he's not a demon.

- Stu, Stu...
- A male witch?

01:04:51,575 --> 01:04:52,843
- It's kind of technical.
- You're a male witch.

1308
01:04:52,867 --> 01:04:54,992
You should go dance, uh,

- Okay. Take your time.

I like Stu.

- He's not... He's not, uh...

He's neither. He's, uh...

Uh, I don't feel that good
about it.

Can... Can I just ask you a,
you know, like, a...

And this actually pertains
to you.

The invitation,
it said "plus one,"

1353
01:06:45,454 --> 01:06:48,454
but it did not specify
if it could be a human

- or if it could be werewolf...
- Your admin sucks.

Yeah, but he could be a vampire
hunter for all we know.

1356
01:06:52,663 --> 01:06:54,205
He could texting his mates,
saying,

in the one place.

of the human known as Stu.

1404
01:08:46,126 --> 01:08:48,042
This is human,
and this is the rules,

1405
01:08:48,167 --> 01:08:49,750
and what is cameras doing here?

1406
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:51,834
One. Then another one.
What is this?

1407
01:08:51,959 --> 01:08:53,376
We're making a documentary on...

a private secret society, mate.

01:08:55,501 --> 01:08:57,768
You don't go bringing your
bloody cameras into everything.

1410
01:08:57,792 --> 01:09:00,334
You will not eat Stu, and
you will not eat the camera guy.

and all your mates behind there,
whoever the hell they are.

We're gonna eat the human being.

And there's nothing
you can do about it, all right?

1416

Now back off
and let my missus get her way.

It is forbidden for vampires

Are you okay, love?
Get out!

1432

- We should probably go, Stu.

- He's a murderer!
- That was great...

1437
01:10:07,378 --> 01:10:11,337
how we both, together,
equally destroyed that guy.

1438
01:10:11,461 --> 01:10:14,129
Yeah, yeah. But it was more Stu
with the giant stick.

1439
01:10:14,254 --> 01:10:17,421
I hope this doesn't make it
awkward for you and The Beast.

1440
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:20,504
No. I think it's opened up
new possibilities.

Guys, where's
your tracksuit pants?

It was washing night.

My missus couldn't wash them,

1462

'cause there was
too much blood on them.

When your legs expand,
they grow into the tracksuit.

Those jeans
are gonna rip completely.

You've lost all those trousers,
guys.

1467

Declan,
that tree's far too thin!

1468
01:11:08,797 --> 01:11:10,131
Look at it!
It's like a branch!

1469
01:11:10,256 --> 01:11:12,505
You know how big you get
when you transform!

1470

That's the wrong tree for you.

- Anton, I've...
- Oh, no.

1472

You've forgot the combination.

Why did you get
a combination lock?

1474

I lost my key last time.

1475

Okay. Well,
it's probably four zeros.

That's the factory setting,
is it?

- CLIFTON: Hey!

- Werewolves, not swear-wolves.

But on transformation nights,
it's all right, all right?

01:11:30,756 --> 01:11:33,464

yourself up, you dickhead!

We'll keep walking.

Yeah, keep walking. By the way,
I find that offensive!

1485
01:11:41,589 --> 01:11:42,589
Is that fur?

Ah, for crying out loud.

1487

Don't look at the fur, everyone!
Get back to your trees, okay?

- VLADISLAV: You're wearing fur.

block your windpipe.

01:23:03,197 --> 01:23:04,631
- Eh?
- What are you laughing at now?

1710
01:23:04,655 --> 01:23:06,364
- Just then?
- Yeah, yeah. But what?

1711
01:23:06,489 --> 01:23:07,573
Oh, I don't know.

1712
01:23:07,697 --> 01:23:10,072
Ah, test failed!
Test failed!

1713
01:23:10,197 --> 01:23:11,905
Yeah. Eh? Eh?
You're laughing now.

1714
01:23:12,030 --> 01:23:13,656
What are you laughing at now,
though?

1715
01:23:13,781 --> 01:23:16,030
- I don't know 'cause...
- Ah. Another failure!

1716
01:23:16,156 --> 01:23:17,823
[Laughter]

1717
01:23:17,948 --> 01:23:19,614
What are you laughing at, Stu?

1718
01:23:19,740 --> 01:23:21,364
Oh, I was laughing
with the group.

1719
01:23:21,489 --> 01:23:22,698
Yep, that's good.
That's good.

1720
01:23:22,823 --> 01:23:24,448
Yeah. See? Yeah.

1721
01:23:24,573 --> 01:23:26,698
Just pay attention.
Pay attention.

1722
01:23:26,823 --> 01:23:28,865
- Laugh with the group.
- Laugh with the group.

1723
01:25:04,993 --> 01:25:07,577
You will not remember
the last hour and a half

1724
01:25:07,702 --> 01:25:10,368
of what you have just seen.

1725
01:25:10,493 --> 01:25:15,160
You will forget
the contents of this movie.

1726
01:25:19,660 --> 01:25:21,035
[Fingers snap]
