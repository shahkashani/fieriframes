A 6-year-old boy was murdered.

00:16:01,473 --> 00:16:03,304
I'm making it my business.

172
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,400
I've told you there's
no forensic evidence

to indicate foul play,
none whatsoever.

I don't really care about
your forensic evidence.

175
00:16:10,215 --> 00:16:11,910
I knew him,

176
00:16:11,984 --> 00:16:13,849
and that's my evidence.

It was heights.

Nevertheless,
he was up there.

181
00:16:22,427 --> 00:16:23,985
Yes, he was.

182
00:16:24,062 --> 00:16:25,552
And what puzzles me...

183
00:16:27,432 --> 00:16:28,524
what keeps me
awake at night

184
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,194

go up there at all.

We're going

You're late.

191

I've called the agency twice.

It's not the baby-sitter, dear.

Come in.

We get 1,000 cases a year.

Unburden yourself, Lagermann.

You'll feel better.

198
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:06,436
We were very busy
the night he was brought in:

00:18:06,513 --> 00:18:08,344
drunk drivers,
Christmas parties.

You're not squeamish,
are you?

201
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:10,849
No.

202
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:20,993
I have a little trick,

203
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:22,995
the kind of thing
you invent in any profession.

204
00:18:23,063 --> 00:18:25,691
I hold a light bulb
inside his trousers.

205
00:18:29,303 --> 00:18:31,703
In one leg,
there is a perforation.

206
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,872
I examine the boy again.
All of this is routine.

207
00:18:37,578 --> 00:18:38,806
I find a hole in his thigh.

208
00:18:40,314 --> 00:18:41,747
There's no bleeding,

209
00:18:41,815 --> 00:18:43,146
and the tissue hasn't contracted.

210
00:18:43,217 --> 00:18:44,343
You know what that means?

211
00:18:44,418 --> 00:18:45,510
No.

212
00:18:45,586 --> 00:18:47,816
It means that
whatever happened at that spot

213
00:18:47,888 --> 00:18:50,482
occurred after his heart
had stopped beating.

214
00:18:54,261 --> 00:18:56,320
I take a closer look
at his trousers.

215
00:18:56,397 --> 00:18:59,127
There's a little indentation
around the hole.

216
00:19:02,436 --> 00:19:04,529
This rings a bell.

217
00:19:04,605 --> 00:19:07,335
So I get out
a biopsy needle,

218
00:19:07,408 --> 00:19:10,343
a kind of syringe, quite big,
attached to a handle.

219
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:12,879
You plunge it into the tissue
to get a sample.

220
00:19:14,681 --> 00:19:16,649
The hole in his trousers

221
00:19:16,717 --> 00:19:18,651
was where someone in a hurry

222
00:19:18,719 --> 00:19:21,187
shoved it in
with a good whack.

223
00:19:23,357 --> 00:19:25,791
Someone had taken
a muscle biopsy from him

224
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:27,292
after he died.

225
00:19:27,361 --> 00:19:28,794
The ambulance men?

226
00:19:28,862 --> 00:19:30,796
I talked to the driver
and the medics

227
00:19:30,864 --> 00:19:32,798
and the orderlies
who received the body.

228
00:19:32,866 --> 00:19:35,426
They all swore
on a stack of Bibles

229
00:19:35,502 --> 00:19:37,026
that they didn't do it.

230
00:19:44,211 --> 00:19:46,873
Why didn't Loyen
tell me this?

231
00:19:46,947 --> 00:19:49,916
I was just beginning the autopsy
when Loyen arrived.

232
00:19:51,752 --> 00:19:53,379
He was surprised
I'd started on the boy.

233
00:19:55,222 --> 00:19:57,349
He pulled me off it
and took over.

234
00:19:57,424 --> 00:20:00,325
What do you think
was after him on the roof?

235
00:20:00,394 --> 00:20:02,328
I don't know.

00:20:02,396 --> 00:20:05,331
But I won't be much
in the Christmas spirit

00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:14,036
Please don't come here again.

One more thing.

00:20:19,613 --> 00:20:20,671
The night he died

241
00:20:20,747 --> 00:20:23,341
wasn't the first time
I'd seen him.

242

alone.

00:24:20,887 --> 00:24:22,912
and keep your
hippocratic oath.

332
00:24:22,989 --> 00:24:25,457
It has to be
5 figures.

333
00:24:25,525 --> 00:24:27,254
I let someone down.

334
00:24:29,162 --> 00:24:31,187
A child.

335
00:24:31,264 --> 00:24:33,232
It'll take money
to do something about it.

336
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,167
I'm afraid that check
won't be nearly enough.

337
00:24:37,704 --> 00:24:39,331
He only gives you money

338
00:24:39,406 --> 00:24:41,340
because you make him
feel so guilty.

339
00:24:41,408 --> 00:24:42,773
He told me that.

340
00:24:42,843 --> 00:24:44,333
And he only gives you money, Benja,

341
00:24:44,411 --> 00:24:47,039
because you're such
an amusing little fuck.

342
00:24:47,114 --> 00:24:49,048
But one day,
like all of us,

343
00:24:49,116 --> 00:24:50,549
you'll wake up

344
00:24:50,617 --> 00:24:52,585
and your perfect tits
will be starting to sag,

345
00:24:52,652 --> 00:24:54,517
and your perfect
little piquant ass

346
00:24:54,588 --> 00:24:56,317
will be starting to go.
Then what, Benja?

347
00:24:56,389 --> 00:24:57,856
By then, Smilla,

348
00:24:57,924 --> 00:24:59,858
you'll be dead,
and I won't care.

349
00:24:59,926 --> 00:25:01,188
Come for Christmas dinner?

350
00:25:04,231 --> 00:25:06,358
I don't celebrate Christmas.

351
00:25:06,433 --> 00:25:08,458
It doesn't mean
anything to me.

352
00:25:16,033 --> 00:25:18,524
They hunted seals
by their igloos.

353
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:21,799
They stalked them
with screens on the ice.

354
00:25:26,777 --> 00:25:28,836
"They waited for them
on a floe edge,

355
00:25:28,912 --> 00:25:32,439
and they harpooned them
from kayaks."

356
00:25:33,884 --> 00:25:35,317
They hunted them

357
00:25:35,385 --> 00:25:38,286
in the bluish darkness
of the winter night.

358
00:25:38,355 --> 00:25:41,290
To the Inuits,
the seal was life.

359
00:25:41,358 --> 00:25:43,258
Isaiah, what did I just say?

360
00:25:43,326 --> 00:25:46,318
Isaiah?

361
00:25:46,396 --> 00:25:48,193
Tell me what I just said.

362
00:25:48,265 --> 00:25:50,290
Tell me.

363
00:25:50,367 --> 00:25:52,528
What did I just say?

364
00:25:54,371 --> 00:25:55,395
My God.

365
00:25:59,743 --> 00:26:00,732
Juliane?

366
00:26:00,811 --> 00:26:02,779
Juliane, Isaiah's gone deaf.

367
00:26:02,846 --> 00:26:04,313
He's gone deaf

368
00:26:04,381 --> 00:26:05,814
from having 3 ear infections

369
00:26:05,882 --> 00:26:07,907
from you not taking care of him!

370
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:09,918
Doctors say he was O.K.

371
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:10,918
What doctors?

372
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:12,477
Who told you he's O.K.?

373
00:26:12,556 --> 00:26:14,080
He's not O.K.

374
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:15,852
There's nothing
to worry about.

375
00:26:22,732 --> 00:26:24,165
<i>Ilaga.</i>

376
00:26:24,234 --> 00:26:25,667
I'm not mad at you.

377
00:26:25,735 --> 00:26:26,667
<i>Ilaga.</i>

378
00:26:26,736 --> 00:26:28,203
Stop it.
I'm not mad at you.

379
00:26:28,271 --> 00:26:30,603
<i>Ilaga, ilaga.</i>

380
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:35,209
Yes, you're my friend.

381
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:36,643
<i>Ilaga,</i> Isaiah.

382
00:27:04,574 --> 00:27:05,802
Please...

383
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:08,674
don't be frightened.

384
00:27:10,013 --> 00:27:11,844
I'm from the district
attorney's office.

385
00:27:11,915 --> 00:27:13,974
Do you always
make house calls?

386
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:17,679
Let's just say it's
the nature of this case...

387
00:27:17,754 --> 00:27:20,723
and because of your
thought-provoking letter.

388
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,724
I spoke to Professor Loyen.

389
00:27:22,792 --> 00:27:25,260
He told me that
you came in to see him.

390
00:27:25,328 --> 00:27:27,228
There were tracks
in the snow.

391
00:27:27,297 --> 00:27:29,128
I read the report
and looked at the pictures.

392
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:31,258
You have to have special
lenses and lights

393
00:27:31,334 --> 00:27:33,302
or it doesn't show up.

394
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:35,235
What doesn't show up?

395
00:27:35,305 --> 00:27:37,205
They were acceleration tracks.

396
00:27:37,274 --> 00:27:39,242
When you take off
from the snow or ice,

397
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:41,072
a pronation occurs
in the ankle joint

398
00:27:41,144 --> 00:27:43,305
like when you walk
barefoot in the sand.

399
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,847
If the movement
is too fast,

400
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:45,939
not firm enough,

401
00:27:46,016 --> 00:27:47,347
they'll be
a little slip backwards.

402
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:48,748
As with any child
who is playing--

403
00:27:48,818 --> 00:27:50,752
If you're used to
playing in the snow,

404
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,754
you don't leave
that kind of track

405
00:27:52,822 --> 00:27:55,620
because the movement
is not efficient.

406
00:27:55,692 --> 00:27:59,685
He grew up in Greenland.
He was used to snow.

407
00:27:59,763 --> 00:28:01,162
You don't believe me?

408
00:28:01,231 --> 00:28:03,665
I didn't say that.

409
00:28:03,733 --> 00:28:06,258
The truth is
I've felt uncomfortable

410
00:28:06,336 --> 00:28:08,270
about this case
from the beginning.

411
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:11,273
And when you wrote
your letter,

412
00:28:11,341 --> 00:28:12,706
that confirmed it for me.

413
00:28:12,776 --> 00:28:15,404
There was so little
to go on.

414
00:28:15,478 --> 00:28:17,708
What do you
want me to do?

415
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:19,408
Find out
what was after him.

416
00:28:25,155 --> 00:28:26,679
I'll do my best.

417
00:28:26,756 --> 00:28:29,316
You have my word.

418
00:28:29,392 --> 00:28:31,223
Thank you.

419
00:28:31,294 --> 00:28:32,886
I don't know
your name.

420
00:28:32,963 --> 00:28:34,123
Ravn.

421
00:28:34,197 --> 00:28:36,427
I'll be in touch
with you.

422
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:40,565
Thank you, Mr. Ravn.

423
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:42,571
Thank you for
believing me.

424
00:29:37,294 --> 00:29:38,226
Hello?

425
00:29:38,295 --> 00:29:40,229
My name is
Smilla Jaspersen.

426
00:29:40,297 --> 00:29:43,232
I have some questions
about Greenland Mining.

427
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,235
I'm sorry,
I can't help you.

428
00:29:46,303 --> 00:29:47,736
I don't work there
anymore.

429
00:29:54,577 --> 00:29:55,635
Who is it?

430
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:58,237
Delivery for Elsa Lubing,
from the florist.

431
00:29:58,315 --> 00:29:59,748
She isn't home.

432
00:29:59,816 --> 00:30:01,078
Could you buzz me in,
please?

433
00:30:01,151 --> 00:30:02,584
We have strict
instructions

434
00:30:02,652 --> 00:30:05,018
not to open the door
for nonresidents.

435
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:07,989
They're orchids,
Mrs. Schou,

436
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:10,026
straight off the plane
from Portugal,

437
00:30:10,093 --> 00:30:11,788
and they'll die
if I leave them out here.

438
00:30:11,861 --> 00:30:13,522
[Buzzer]

439
00:30:19,836 --> 00:30:21,827
I can see you!

440
00:30:21,905 --> 00:30:24,430
You won't get away
with anything.

441
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:31,770
I remember this letter
quite well.

442
00:30:31,848 --> 00:30:34,612
She said
she had flowers.

443
00:30:34,684 --> 00:30:37,016
It's all right,
Mrs. Schou.

444
00:30:39,255 --> 00:30:41,780
At this time of day,
I'm normally in prayer.

445
00:30:47,831 --> 00:30:51,790
Norsaq Christiansen's death
was a tragic accident,

446
00:30:51,868 --> 00:30:53,301
especially for the boy.

447
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:55,338
A child needs
both parents...

448
00:30:56,606 --> 00:30:59,803
one of the reasons
why marriage is sacred.

449
00:30:59,876 --> 00:31:02,709
Mr. Lubing would be
pleased to hear that.

450
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:03,803
There's no Mr. Lubing.

451
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,144
I am the bride ofJesus.

452
00:31:07,851 --> 00:31:09,614
The boy is dead.

453
00:31:09,686 --> 00:31:12,211
4 days ago,
he fell off a roof.

454
00:31:19,329 --> 00:31:21,456
I met him once.

455
00:31:21,531 --> 00:31:24,762
When I saw him
I knew why it was written:

456
00:31:24,834 --> 00:31:27,268
"Unless we become
as little children,

457
00:31:27,337 --> 00:31:29,237
we cannot enter paradise."

458
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:31,773
I hope his mother
finds her way toJesus.

459
00:31:31,841 --> 00:31:34,105
Only if one can find Him
at the bottom of a bottle.

460
00:31:34,177 --> 00:31:35,610
Oh, He is everywhere,

461
00:31:35,678 --> 00:31:37,077
even there.

462
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:39,581
Someone chased the boy
off the roof.

463
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:41,412
He was murdered.

464
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,782
The devil assumes
many forms.

465
00:31:48,858 --> 00:31:52,954
It's one of those forms
that I'm looking for.

466
00:31:53,029 --> 00:31:56,192
Do you know
a Professor Loyen?

467
00:31:56,266 --> 00:31:57,358
No.

468
00:31:57,434 --> 00:31:59,834
Was he on the payroll
of Greenland Mining?

469
00:31:59,903 --> 00:32:00,995
I don't remember.

470
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:03,197
You said that
you met Isaiah.

471
00:32:03,273 --> 00:32:04,205
When?

472
00:32:04,274 --> 00:32:06,868
Greenland Mining
began to hire Inuits

473
00:32:06,943 --> 00:32:08,376
for the geological expeditions,

474
00:32:08,445 --> 00:32:11,346
and it was on
one of those expeditions

475
00:32:11,414 --> 00:32:15,282
in the summer of 1993

476
00:32:15,351 --> 00:32:18,047
on the Gela Alta glacier...

477
00:32:21,124 --> 00:32:22,284
that the father died.

478
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:24,292
When we awarded
the pension,

479
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,794
the son and his mother
came to my office.

480
00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:29,297
How did
the father die?

481
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:31,656
An explosion.

482
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:37,243
You are interested
in the past, Ms.Jaspersen.

483
00:32:37,377 --> 00:32:40,676
I'm interested in why

484
00:32:40,747 --> 00:32:43,238
the chief accountant
of Greenland Mining

485
00:32:43,316 --> 00:32:44,783
has such
a guilty conscience

486
00:32:44,851 --> 00:32:46,512
that she's writing
notes in the margins

487
00:32:46,586 --> 00:32:48,713
of pension awards.

488
00:32:51,357 --> 00:32:53,291
May I see the report

489
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:54,519
of that expedition?

490
00:32:54,594 --> 00:32:58,291
They're in the safe
in the archive department.

491
00:32:58,364 --> 00:33:00,355
There's nothing to see.

492
00:33:01,968 --> 00:33:04,027
Thou shalt not lie,
Ms. Lubing.

493

Anything is better
than suicide?

How can you have
6 spelling mistakes in 5 words?

Suicide is for cowards.

There was an earlier
expedition in '66.

I can't be
part of this.

They threatened
to lock me up.

And I can't be locked up.

Really, I am.

I just can't be locked up.
Don't.

It's O.K.

Do you think I need you
to understand me?

God. Sorry.

want to insult you?

684
00:47:26,687 --> 00:47:29,622
When my father
first brought me here

685
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:31,123
from Greenland,

686
00:47:31,191 --> 00:47:33,352
I refused to sleep indoors.

687
00:47:36,196 --> 00:47:38,630
I couldn't stand it:
the heat.

688
00:47:38,699 --> 00:47:41,668
I was used to the snow,
the air.

689
00:47:43,203 --> 00:47:45,171
I made a tent
out on the lawn.

Poor Moritz.

691
00:47:47,207 --> 00:47:48,640
He was so embarrassed.

692
00:47:48,709 --> 00:47:51,644
Even now my idea of hell
is to be locked up.

693

Where...

694
00:47:53,213 --> 00:47:54,961
Where was your mother?

695
00:47:55,095 --> 00:47:56,824
She went out one day
to hunt.

696
00:47:56,897 --> 00:47:59,832
They found her kayak
a few days later.

697
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,130
The side had been
staved in.

698
00:48:02,202 --> 00:48:04,136
No one who falls
into the water in Greenland

699
00:48:04,204 --> 00:48:05,262
ever comes up again.

700
00:48:05,338 --> 00:48:08,273
The sea is less than
39 degrees Fahrenheit,

701
00:48:08,341 --> 00:48:09,774
and at that temperature,

702
00:48:09,843 --> 00:48:11,834
all the processes of
decomposition stop.

703

That's when
you came here?

705
00:48:14,748 --> 00:48:16,682
That's when my father
brought me here.

706
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,581
But you were never
happy here?

707
00:48:18,652 --> 00:48:21,587
The only thing
that makes me truly happy

708
00:48:21,655 --> 00:48:25,091
is mathematics,
snow, ice,

709
00:48:25,158 --> 00:48:26,318
numbers.

710
00:48:29,029 --> 00:48:33,090
To me, the number system
is like human life.

711
00:48:33,166 --> 00:48:36,101
First you have
the natural numbers,

712
00:48:36,169 --> 00:48:39,104
the ones that are whole
and positive,

713
00:48:39,172 --> 00:48:42,107
like the numbers
of a small child.

714
00:48:42,175 --> 00:48:44,109
But human consciousness expands,

715
00:48:44,177 --> 00:48:46,111
and the child
discovers longing.

716
00:48:46,179 --> 00:48:50,616
Do you know the mathematical
expression for longing?

717
00:48:50,684 --> 00:48:53,016
Negative numbers.

718
00:48:53,086 --> 00:48:54,986
The formalization
of the feeling

719
00:48:55,055 --> 00:48:56,920
that you're missing
something.

720
00:48:56,990 --> 00:48:59,925
Then the child discovers
the in-between spaces

721
00:48:59,993 --> 00:49:02,120
between stones,
between people,

722
00:49:02,195 --> 00:49:04,459
between numbers,
and that produces fractions.

723
00:49:04,531 --> 00:49:06,863
But it's like
a kind of madness,

724
00:49:06,933 --> 00:49:09,128
because it doesn't
even stop there.

725
00:49:09,202 --> 00:49:11,136
It never stops.
There are numbers

726
00:49:11,204 --> 00:49:13,570
that we can't even
begin to comprehend.

727
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,403
Mathematics is a vast,
open landscape.

728
00:49:15,475 --> 00:49:19,070
You head towards the horizon
that is always receding...

729
00:49:19,145 --> 00:49:21,079
like Greenland.

730

<i>Makittaqanngitsoq.</i>

Pff. Jesus.

995
01:08:02,171 --> 01:08:04,162
[Laughing]

996
01:08:05,641 --> 01:08:07,871
Someone who has never
mastered the art

997
01:08:07,943 --> 01:08:10,173
of rolling over
in a kayak.

998
01:08:12,548 --> 01:08:14,914
<i>Umiiarneq.</i>

999
01:08:16,318 --> 01:08:19,048
A shipwrecked person.

1000
01:08:22,057 --> 01:08:24,321
You're not shipwrecked.

1001
01:08:30,266 --> 01:08:32,427
<i>Pilluaqaanga.</i>

1002
01:08:33,769 --> 01:08:35,896
It's to be deeply happy.

1003
01:08:42,444 --> 01:08:45,140
I'm sorry,
I have to go.

1004
01:08:45,214 --> 01:08:47,045
Smilla?

1005
01:08:47,116 --> 01:08:49,050
You cannot stay
in your apartment.

1006
01:08:49,118 --> 01:08:51,552
They've already tried
to kill you once,

1007
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:53,554
and if they know
you're alive,

1008
01:08:53,622 --> 01:08:56,318
they won't make the
same mistake again.

1009
01:08:56,392 --> 01:08:58,326
Now go to your
father's house.

1010
01:08:58,394 --> 01:09:00,624
You'll be safer
with him.

1011
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:13,240
I've seen
that car before.

1012
01:09:14,677 --> 01:09:16,668
Don't turn around.

1013
01:10:38,427 --> 01:10:42,295
They found something
in 1 966.

1014
01:10:43,599 --> 01:10:44,930
Something went wrong,

1015
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,763
and they waited
30 years

1016
01:10:46,835 --> 01:10:49,360
before they sent
another expedition.

1017
01:10:49,438 --> 01:10:51,372
But then something else
went wrong.

1018
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,169
There was an accident.

1019
01:10:53,242 --> 01:10:54,607
4 men died.

1020
01:10:55,811 --> 01:10:58,211
One of them was
Isaiah's father.

1021
01:10:58,280 --> 01:10:59,941
So before Isaiah's
father dies,

1022
01:11:00,015 --> 01:11:02,210
he sends his son a tape

1023
01:11:02,284 --> 01:11:04,411
telling him what
really happened.

1024
01:11:04,486 --> 01:11:06,920
Tork comes looking
for the tape,

1025
01:11:06,989 --> 01:11:09,958
they kill Isaiah to get it.

1026
01:11:10,025 --> 01:11:13,119
And then they killed
the man on the boat.

1027
01:11:15,531 --> 01:11:17,396
There's got to be
something else

1028
01:11:17,466 --> 01:11:18,865
on that tape.

1029
01:11:18,934 --> 01:11:20,731
Like what they
really found

1030
01:11:20,803 --> 01:11:22,737
up there in Greenland.

1031
01:11:22,805 --> 01:11:25,433
They're planning
to go up again.

1032
01:11:25,507 --> 01:11:27,236
They've had to wait
until now

1033
01:11:27,309 --> 01:11:30,176
for the pack ice to melt
in the Davis Strait.

1034
01:11:31,413 --> 01:11:33,040
I know a man...

1035
01:11:33,115 --> 01:11:35,015
who knows about boats.

1036
01:11:40,808 --> 01:11:43,242
Norsaq Christiansen, dead,

1037
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:46,575
on the Gela Alta glacier,
July 1 993.

1038
01:11:46,647 --> 01:11:48,478
Hmm.

1039
01:11:48,549 --> 01:11:50,107
It says in the report

1040
01:11:50,184 --> 01:11:51,776
that he died
in an explosion,

1041
01:11:51,852 --> 01:11:54,753
but I don't think that's
what killed these men.

1042
01:11:56,557 --> 01:11:59,993
These are enlargements
I made from the negatives.

1043
01:12:02,263 --> 01:12:05,892
You can see what remains
of the liver,

1044
01:12:05,966 --> 01:12:08,526
the esophagus, stomach.

1045
01:12:08,602 --> 01:12:10,194
This is the heart--

1046
01:12:10,271 --> 01:12:11,431
what's left of it.

1047
01:12:11,505 --> 01:12:12,699
Smilla?

1048
01:12:14,074 --> 01:12:18,204
Do you notice anything
unusual here?

1049
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:22,148
Something's got
into the heart.

1050
01:12:22,216 --> 01:12:23,945
But what is it?

1051
01:12:24,018 --> 01:12:25,315
This-- This is so gross.

1052
01:12:25,386 --> 01:12:27,251
What's it got
to do with us?

1053
01:12:27,321 --> 01:12:29,482
Get her out of here.

1054
01:12:30,824 --> 01:12:33,224
Darling, why don't you
wait for me outside?

1055
01:12:33,294 --> 01:12:34,591
I'll join you later.

1056
01:12:34,662 --> 01:12:35,594
But it's disgusting.

1057
01:12:35,663 --> 01:12:37,722
What's it got
to do with us?

1058
01:12:37,798 --> 01:12:39,732
I'll be with you soon.

1059
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:40,994
Please. Please.

1060
01:12:41,068 --> 01:12:42,535
Smilla?

1061
01:12:43,671 --> 01:12:46,435
This is the arctic worm.

1062
01:12:46,507 --> 01:12:49,738
<i>Drancunculus Borealis.</i>

1063
01:12:50,878 --> 01:12:52,004
Prehistoric.

1064
01:12:53,314 --> 01:12:56,579
No one has seen pictures
of them before.

1065
01:12:56,650 --> 01:12:59,175
Loyen must have
photographed them.

1066
01:13:00,287 --> 01:13:01,845
You see, the female worm

1067
01:13:01,922 --> 01:13:05,016
entered these men's
vital organs.

1068
01:13:08,462 --> 01:13:09,690
The uterus burst.

1069
01:13:09,763 --> 01:13:12,459
There were 1 0 million
larvae released.

1070
01:13:12,533 --> 01:13:14,467
The men go into toxic shock.

1071
01:13:14,535 --> 01:13:17,470
They die on the spot.
But it's very strange.

1072
01:13:17,538 --> 01:13:20,200
Parasites don't usually
kill their hosts.

1073
01:13:20,274 --> 01:13:21,935
It's very bad manners.

1074
01:13:24,211 --> 01:13:27,203
But I thought the worm
was extinct.

1075
01:13:27,281 --> 01:13:29,408
I thought so too, Smilla.

1076
01:13:30,484 --> 01:13:31,746
But the question is,

1077
01:13:31,819 --> 01:13:34,481
what brought them
back to life?

1078
01:13:38,792 --> 01:13:40,987
Why are you getting
involved in this?

1079
01:13:41,061 --> 01:13:43,291
I told you before...
a child died.

1080
01:13:43,364 --> 01:13:45,229
It's my New Year's resolution

1081
01:13:45,299 --> 01:13:47,494
to make someone pay.

1082
01:13:49,336 --> 01:13:53,238
This friend of yours
who dropped you off.

1083
01:13:53,307 --> 01:13:55,605
Is he also involved?

1084
01:13:55,676 --> 01:13:57,075
I don't know.

1085
01:13:58,245 --> 01:14:00,270
I don't know him
very well.

1086
01:14:01,949 --> 01:14:04,179
He has a repair shop

1087
01:14:04,251 --> 01:14:06,947
which he never goes to.

1088
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:08,954
His hands
are much too clean.

1089
01:14:09,022 --> 01:14:10,455
He lies to me.

1090
01:14:10,524 --> 01:14:12,685
I don't know what he does.

1091
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:14,591
Are you in love with him?

1092
01:14:15,896 --> 01:14:17,693
I've been trying
to avoid it

1093
01:14:17,765 --> 01:14:18,823
all my life,

1094
01:14:18,899 --> 01:14:19,957
so now that
it's here,

1095
01:14:20,033 --> 01:14:21,830
I just want
to renounce it.

1096
01:14:21,902 --> 01:14:23,460
I'm sorry to hear that.

1097
01:14:23,537 --> 01:14:26,097
I'm tired of
wondering why it is

1098
01:14:26,173 --> 01:14:28,403
that every day
I'm on this earth

1099
01:14:28,475 --> 01:14:29,407
I'm in exile.

1100
01:14:29,476 --> 01:14:32,138
I'm sorry you're so angry.

1101
01:14:34,348 --> 01:14:37,340
I'm sorry
I made you do things.

1102
01:14:37,418 --> 01:14:40,216
Is it time for
confession, Moritz?

1103
01:14:40,287 --> 01:14:42,721
What things did you
make me do?

1104
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:44,781
I made you leave
your country.

1105
01:14:44,858 --> 01:14:46,655
What were you
supposed to do,

1106
01:14:46,727 --> 01:14:47,751
leave me there?

1107
01:14:47,828 --> 01:14:49,887
I punished you because
your mother was dead.

1108
01:14:49,963 --> 01:14:54,627
I'd look at you,
and I'd see her face.

1109
01:14:54,701 --> 01:14:56,259
I never loved anyone

1110
01:14:56,336 --> 01:14:59,066
the way I loved
your mother.

1111
01:14:59,139 --> 01:15:02,506
Benja will be sorry
to hear that.

1112
01:15:04,745 --> 01:15:07,179
It's late, Smilla.
I'm going to bed.

1113
01:15:31,772 --> 01:15:35,401
All day today I thought
about your hands on me.

1114
01:15:37,110 --> 01:15:39,010
Your mouth on my mouth.

1115
01:15:53,293 --> 01:15:54,726
This friend of yours, Lander.

1116
01:15:54,795 --> 01:15:56,057
What does he do?

1117
01:15:56,129 --> 01:15:57,357
He owns the place.

1118
01:15:59,466 --> 01:16:01,696
Now, what can I do for you?

1119
01:16:01,768 --> 01:16:03,668
I need to know where
the boat is going...

1120
01:16:03,737 --> 01:16:05,671
why it's going,
and who's behind it.

1121
01:16:05,739 --> 01:16:07,070
The ship you saw, the <i>Kronos,</i>

1122
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:08,402
it's classified ice class.

1123
01:16:08,475 --> 01:16:10,705
They spent an incredible
amount of money

1124
01:16:10,777 --> 01:16:12,176
getting her ready.

1125
01:16:12,246 --> 01:16:14,180
Whatever they're after
has to be very lucrative

1126
01:16:14,248 --> 01:16:16,182
for them to recoup
the investment they've made.

1127
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:17,239
But you don't know...

1128
01:16:17,317 --> 01:16:19,751
Normally a ship is
chartered with a crew.

1129
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:21,082
But in this situation,

1130
01:16:21,154 --> 01:16:23,179
you would prefer
a bare-boat charter--

1131
01:16:23,257 --> 01:16:24,588
a ship and nothing else.

1132
01:16:24,658 --> 01:16:26,182
Then you find a captain.

1133
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:29,195
He has to be a special
kind of person,

1134
01:16:29,263 --> 01:16:32,198
the kind you can take aside,
and over a full glass

1135
01:16:32,266 --> 01:16:33,699
tell him that his wages

1136
01:16:33,767 --> 01:16:35,530
will be a little
out of the ordinary.

1137
01:16:35,602 --> 01:16:37,035
On the other hand,

1138
01:16:37,104 --> 01:16:39,038
you need all his tact
and sensitivity.

1139
01:16:39,106 --> 01:16:41,165
Where would someone
find such a person?

1140
01:16:42,309 --> 01:16:44,072
Right here.

1141
01:16:45,345 --> 01:16:48,075
That gentleman over there.

1142
01:16:48,148 --> 01:16:49,581
Captain Sigmund Lukas.

1143
01:16:49,650 --> 01:16:51,208
A very, very skilled
German seaman.

1144
01:16:51,285 --> 01:16:53,845
Knows the North Atlantic
like no one else.

1145
01:16:53,921 --> 01:16:55,388
Doesn't drink,
but he gambles.

1146
01:16:55,455 --> 01:16:58,322
He no longer has
a home or a family.

1147
01:16:58,392 --> 01:17:00,417
And now he's for sale,

1148
01:17:00,494 --> 01:17:02,428
if the amount
is big enough.

1149
01:17:02,496 --> 01:17:03,929
If he's so broke,

1150
01:17:03,997 --> 01:17:05,362
whose money is he
playing with?

1151
01:17:05,432 --> 01:17:06,694
Uncle Lander's money, honey.

1152

01:47:54,381 --> 01:47:55,814
His father collapsed

1471
01:47:55,883 --> 01:47:57,874
while he was still
near the surface.

1472
01:47:57,952 --> 01:48:00,182
The boy wanted to go to him.

1473
01:48:00,254 --> 01:48:05,191
It was Loyen's idea
to keep him under observation.

1474
01:48:05,259 --> 01:48:08,490
The worm was not
in his internal organs.

1475
01:48:08,562 --> 01:48:10,189
He never even felt it.

Aaarrrgh!

1478
01:48:45,132 --> 01:48:47,157
He killed my son.

1482

Tork!

1483
01:51:16,168 --> 01:51:17,192
Tork!

1484
01:51:39,558 --> 01:51:42,118
The boy, Tork.

1485
01:51:42,194 --> 01:51:44,685
Tell me about
the day he died.

1486
01:51:49,768 --> 01:51:52,202
You were waiting
outside his school,

1487
01:51:52,271 --> 01:51:53,704
weren't you, Tork?

1488
01:51:53,772 --> 01:51:56,206
He's the only child
who walks home alone.

1489
01:52:02,915 --> 01:52:05,577
Smilla:
You follow him.

1490
01:52:05,651 --> 01:52:09,382
You grab him,

1491
01:52:09,455 --> 01:52:12,686
not by his arms,
but by his clothes

1492
01:52:12,758 --> 01:52:15,727
so you don't leave
any marks.

1493
01:52:17,796 --> 01:52:19,923
But you miscalculate.

1494
01:52:27,306 --> 01:52:29,672
He knows you, Tork,

1495
01:52:29,742 --> 01:52:31,175
Not from the hospital

1496
01:52:31,243 --> 01:52:33,734
where you spent hours
tormenting him,

1497
01:52:33,812 --> 01:52:36,975
but from the day
he saw his father die.

1498
01:52:37,049 --> 01:52:39,677
It's death itself
he associates with you.

1499
01:52:39,752 --> 01:52:40,980
You're guessing.

1500
01:52:45,257 --> 01:52:47,088
He gets to his building

1501
01:52:47,159 --> 01:52:49,184
and then there's
no escape.

1502
01:52:51,263 --> 01:52:54,630
He knows
what's behind him.

1503
01:52:54,700 --> 01:52:57,498
He knows
he's going to die.

1504
01:52:57,569 --> 01:53:01,938
This fear is even stronger
than his fear of heights.

1505
01:53:02,007 --> 01:53:03,872
Inside him an engine
is spinning

1506
01:53:03,942 --> 01:53:05,569
that will keep turning

1507
01:53:05,644 --> 01:53:08,010
until all his strength
is used up.

1508
01:53:11,283 --> 01:53:14,218
And you chase him
up to the roof.

1509
01:53:14,286 --> 01:53:17,221
Maybe for the first time
it occurs to you

1510
01:53:17,289 --> 01:53:19,223
not just to get the tape...

1511
01:53:19,291 --> 01:53:22,727
but that it's possible
to eliminate him.

1512
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:30,268
And avoid him
ever telling anyone

1513
01:53:30,335 --> 01:53:32,235
what he saw in a cave
on a glacier somewhere

1514
01:53:32,304 --> 01:53:33,498
in the Davis Strait.

1515
01:53:37,042 --> 01:53:38,703
I didn't mean
to kill him.

1516
01:53:38,777 --> 01:53:41,109
I needed the tape.

1517
01:53:41,180 --> 01:53:43,375
He panicked,
I shouted,

1518
01:53:43,449 --> 01:53:45,781
he turned around,
he didn't see me.

1519
01:53:45,851 --> 01:53:48,183
You're lying.

1520
01:53:51,757 --> 01:53:53,588
He didn't turn around.

1521
01:53:56,762 --> 01:53:59,356
He couldn't hear a thing.

1522
01:54:02,267 --> 01:54:04,531
He was deaf.
