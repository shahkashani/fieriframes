1
00:00:33,282 --> 00:00:36,479
What are you
doing down there? Just standing there?

2
00:00:36,585 --> 00:00:39,679
Just filming the main room
Whiskers!

3
00:00:39,788 --> 00:00:42,518
Well, did you know that
Whiskers has disappeared?

4
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:45,287
A cat got out I'm trying to get him in
Has he? Ah

5
00:00:45,394 --> 00:00:49,262
Yeah, we don't know how he got out
I think he got out in that hole there

6
00:00:49,365 --> 00:00:52,528
No, I knew they were coming, and l...
I think he got out in that hole

7
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:55,536
He can jump up there
I knew they were coming and...

8
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,868
Yeah No, he got out
in that hole, Edie

9
00:00:57,973 --> 00:01:00,874
I put them all out
You told me to

10
00:01:00,976 --> 00:01:04,343
No, dearie, he got out
in the hole, babe

11
00:01:04,446 --> 00:01:06,710
"Take the cats out,"you said

12
00:01:06,815 --> 00:01:09,716
Did you hear what I said, woman?
What?

13
00:01:09,818 --> 00:01:13,379
He got out in this hole here
That was the noise we heard

14
00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:17,357
That raccoon did that to my new wall
Isn't that terrible?

15
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:20,019
They'll have the whole house
down soon

16
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:23,292
[Edie]
Yeah, we'll be raided again

17
00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:27,062
We'll be raided again
by the village of East Hampton

18
00:01:27,169 --> 00:01:32,903
You know, they can get you in East Hampton
for wearing red shoes on a Thursday

19
00:01:33,008 --> 00:01:34,839
and all that sort of thing

20
00:01:34,943 --> 00:01:37,844
I don't know whether you know that
I mean, do you know that?

21
00:01:37,946 --> 00:01:40,346
They can get you
for almost anything

22
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:59,059
It's the Maysles!
[Albert Maysles] Hi, Edie

23
00:02:59,161 --> 00:03:01,595
The gentlemen callers
I saw your car

24
00:03:01,697 --> 00:03:04,757
One of my cats just got out
Edie, you look fantastic

25
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,992
David, you look absolutely
terrific Honestly

26
00:03:08,103 --> 00:03:11,038
You've got light...
You've got light blue on

27
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,304
Well, Al, you're still...
Mother says you're very conservative

28
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,346
[Laughs]
Brooks, everything looks wonderful

29
00:03:19,448 --> 00:03:23,214
Thank you
Absolutely wonderful

30
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:26,481
This is the best thing
to wear for the day You understand

31
00:03:26,588 --> 00:03:29,182
Yeah
Because I don't like women in skirts

32
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:32,624
and the best thing is to wear
pantyhose or some pants

33
00:03:32,728 --> 00:03:35,492
under a short skirt, I think

34
00:03:35,597 --> 00:03:38,532
Then you have the pants
under the skirt

35
00:03:38,634 --> 00:03:42,968
and then you can pull the stockings
up over the pants, underneath the skirt

36
00:03:43,071 --> 00:03:46,165
Uh-huh
And you can always take off

37
00:03:46,275 --> 00:03:49,301
So I think this is the best
costume for the day

38
00:03:49,411 --> 00:03:51,902
Okay
[Laughs]

39
00:03:52,014 --> 00:03:55,142
I have to think
these things up, you know

40
00:03:56,852 --> 00:04:00,549
Mother wanted me to come out
in a kimono, so we had quite a fight

41
00:04:00,656 --> 00:04:03,853
So what did you do, photograph Brooks
cutting right down here?

42
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,122
Yeah, I've been through the jungle
Oh, for goodness sakes

43
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:10,926
What do you want to do now?
Where do you want to go? Upstairs?

44
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:14,196
Do you want to go up
and photograph it from the top porch?

45
00:04:14,303 --> 00:04:16,203
Okay
Okay

46
00:04:16,305 --> 00:04:20,139
They're gonna photograph
from the top now, Brooks

47
00:04:31,453 --> 00:04:33,978
[David]
It's a beautiful garden back here

48
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:36,284
Did you see the wall garden?

49
00:04:36,391 --> 00:04:38,689
Oh, you mean the patio You mean this
Yeah

50
00:04:38,794 --> 00:04:42,890
That's a Spanish wall garden
over there, you know

51
00:04:42,998 --> 00:04:45,193
Oh, yes
The Hills put that in

52
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,234
They imported everything from Rome

53
00:04:47,336 --> 00:04:50,931
Mrs. Hill, she was
a famous horticulturist

54
00:04:53,609 --> 00:04:56,635
That was one of the famous
gardens of America

55
00:04:56,745 --> 00:04:58,975
Brooks, next summer,
if we're all living

56
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:01,845
I think a vegetable garden
would be a good thing in here

57
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,043
You don't get
enough sunlight in here

58
00:05:04,152 --> 00:05:09,749
Yeah, Mother says she doesn't mind if you
have to cut down some privet for the garden

59
00:05:09,858 --> 00:05:12,520
Would be nice
Yeah

60
00:05:12,628 --> 00:05:18,157
Because food's going up
We heard that on the radio last night

61
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:23,637
Do you think my costume looked all right
for Brooks? I think he was a little amazed

62
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:27,835
He's probably seen it before
No, no This is the revolutionary costume

63
00:05:27,943 --> 00:05:30,844
I never wear this in East Hampton

64
00:05:33,248 --> 00:05:36,240
He seems okay
He seems like he can handle it

65
00:05:36,351 --> 00:05:39,582
You can't be too careful
Know what I mean?

66
00:05:39,688 --> 00:05:42,953
That was the original living room

67
00:05:44,793 --> 00:05:47,956
You know, people go back
to a kitchen now

68
00:05:48,063 --> 00:05:51,499
Though the washing machine was always
put in the maids' dining room

69
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,831
You know, the washtubs are
in the maids' dining room

70
00:05:56,271 --> 00:05:58,671
Let's go up
It's very difficult

71
00:05:58,774 --> 00:06:01,504
to keep the line between
the past and the present

72
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,511
Do you know what I mean?
It's awfully difficult

73
00:06:15,157 --> 00:06:18,092
That is
a beautiful ocean today, isn't it?

74
00:06:18,193 --> 00:06:21,321
What color would you say that was?
Sort of sapphire?

75
00:06:22,564 --> 00:06:25,362
I've never seen
anything like that ocean

76
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:28,368
The 50 years I've been here...

77
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,200
the best in 50 years

78
00:06:31,306 --> 00:06:35,470
Oh, Edie, are you around?

79
00:06:35,577 --> 00:06:38,740
Oh, Edie!
I haven't been out of this goddamn horrible place

80
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,747
in two years

81
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:43,340
God, if you knew how I felt
I'm ready to kill

82
00:06:43,452 --> 00:06:45,613
Well, they're not going
to take you to the beach

83
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:48,451
Brooks wants his his check, Mother darling
All right, give me the...

84
00:06:48,557 --> 00:06:50,855
He's at the door
I told you I should do it now

85
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:53,894
Twenty-four bucks for three cuttings
Just a minute

86
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,157
I told you... Better bring the pen

87
00:06:56,264 --> 00:06:58,323
I locked all the cats away

88
00:06:58,433 --> 00:07:02,426
[Cats Meowing]
Don't be so mean They don't wanna be locked away

89
00:07:02,537 --> 00:07:06,132
The poor little kitties
You know kitties adore sun

90
00:07:10,445 --> 00:07:13,573
I suppose I won't get out
of here till she dies or I die

91
00:07:13,682 --> 00:07:16,810
Who's she? The cat?
I don't know when I'm gonna get out of here

92
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:19,978
Why do you want to get out?
Another place'd be much worse

93
00:07:20,088 --> 00:07:22,113
Any place will be much worse
Here

94
00:07:22,224 --> 00:07:24,784
Any place on earth
Yeah, but I like freedom

95
00:07:24,893 --> 00:07:28,226
Well, you can't get it, darling
You're being supported

96
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,458
You can't get any freedom
when you're being supported

97
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:33,659
You can't?
No, you can't

98
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:37,170
I think you're not free when
you're not being supported

99
00:07:37,272 --> 00:07:39,968
It's awful both ways
Well, you don't look it

100
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:43,408
You look very young
for 56 years of age

101
00:07:43,512 --> 00:07:45,639
Don't you remember
what you told me...

102
00:07:45,747 --> 00:07:48,773
I'd just like a couple of days on the beach, that's all
What was it you told me?

103
00:07:48,884 --> 00:07:53,787
Twenty-four bucks
You don't have to scream that out

104
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:57,347
When are you gonna learn, Edie?
You're in this world, you know

105
00:07:57,459 --> 00:07:59,927
You're not out of the world

106
00:08:00,028 --> 00:08:02,019
[Edie Sighs]

107
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:05,497
Let's see if I can remember the date
Is it the 12th today?

108
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,730
Well, there are certain compensations, I guess
Is it the 12th today?

109
00:08:13,175 --> 00:08:16,372
The old woman, she has to remember
everything, you know that

110
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:19,774
I think this is correct

111
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:25,452
Brooks Hiers H-I-E-R-S

112
00:08:25,554 --> 00:08:28,455
Oh, I didn't think it was necessary
Yes

113
00:08:28,557 --> 00:08:31,993
Why didn't you let me do this in the house for?
Why did you make me do it here?

114
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,619
Mother, you don't have
enough clothes on

115
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:37,789
Well, I hope... I'm gonna get naked in
just a minute, so you better watch out

116
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:40,891
That's what I'm afraid of
Yeah, for what? Now, why?

117
00:08:41,002 --> 00:08:43,971
I haven't got any warts on me
But the movie, the movie

118
00:08:44,072 --> 00:08:47,405
I haven't got any warts on me
That isn't the point, Mother darling

119
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:50,444
Well, you know where you got,
being like that

120
00:08:50,545 --> 00:08:52,604
No husband, no babies, nothing

121
00:08:52,714 --> 00:08:54,944
I can't help it
I like to wear certain things

122
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,542
Is that H-Y-E-R? H-Y?
She likes everything without girdles

123
00:08:58,653 --> 00:09:02,180
H-Y, Edie, or H-I?
H-Y-E-R-S

124
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,190
H-Y?
Yeah

125
00:09:05,627 --> 00:09:08,494
She and Marjorie don't believe
in wearing girdles

126
00:09:08,597 --> 00:09:11,157
I haven't worn a girdle
since I was 12 years old

127
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:13,666
Here you are
Mother has certain ideas about, uh...

128
00:09:13,768 --> 00:09:17,204
I certainly have certain ideas about living a long time
About clothes

129
00:09:17,305 --> 00:09:20,468
That's what I got ideas about
[Door Closes]

130
00:09:20,575 --> 00:09:25,035
It's very hard to live nowadays
Living is very difficult

131
00:09:29,217 --> 00:09:33,654
"The Libra husband
is not an easy man to please

132
00:09:35,557 --> 00:09:39,584
"The monotony of domesticity
is not to his liking

133
00:09:39,694 --> 00:09:44,631
but he is a passionate man
and a respecter of tradition"

134
00:09:46,368 --> 00:09:49,599
All I have to do
is find this Libra man

135
00:09:50,906 --> 00:09:54,808
"The Libra husband is reasonable

136
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,037
"He is a born judge

137
00:09:57,145 --> 00:10:00,080
"and no other zodiacal type

"can order his life

139
00:10:03,685 --> 00:10:06,279
with so much wisdom"

140
00:10:06,388 --> 00:10:09,721
My God!
That's all I need... order

141
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:13,727
That's all I need... an ordered life

142
00:10:13,828 --> 00:10:16,092
You know, a manager

143
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,723
But he's got to be a Libran

144
00:10:21,736 --> 00:10:23,636
[Man]
Hello

145
00:10:23,738 --> 00:10:25,535
Yeah?

146
00:10:27,175 --> 00:10:30,372
That sounds like Jerry
Oh, is that Jerry? For goodness sakes

147
00:10:30,478 --> 00:10:33,777
[Edie Laughing]
What are you doing?

148
00:10:33,882 --> 00:10:36,442
Jerry, you're Aquarius, aren't you?

149
00:10:36,551 --> 00:10:39,019
That's what I saw
when I met you, Jerry

150
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,611
Remember I said the Marble Faun,
and it was terrible

151
00:10:41,723 --> 00:10:46,626
Terrible, the tragedy
connected with the Marble Faun

152
00:10:46,728 --> 00:10:52,428
You know, I call Jerry "the Marble Faun"
Nathaniel Hawthorne

153
00:10:52,534 --> 00:10:54,434
Yeah
Yeah

154
00:10:54,536 --> 00:10:56,504
Do you have that book here, Edie?

155
00:10:56,605 --> 00:10:58,766
I haven't been able to find it

156
00:10:58,873 --> 00:11:01,842
If you run across it,
I'd like to read it

157
00:11:01,943 --> 00:11:05,970
It's very deep I don't know whether
you... Well, I guess you're up to it

158
00:11:06,081 --> 00:11:08,242
They used to have it
on all the, uh...

159
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:12,218
I think it was on the high school
reading list The Marble Faun

160
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,223
"The Libra husband
does not seek divorce

161
00:11:17,325 --> 00:11:21,091
"unless the conditions of his life

162
00:11:21,196 --> 00:11:23,096
are not adjustable"

163
00:11:23,198 --> 00:11:26,634
I don't believe in divorce at all

164
00:11:26,735 --> 00:11:29,169
I think divorce...
Was your mother divorced or no?

165
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,171
No
Separated

166
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:35,334
Yes, and then my father got a,
got a fake Mexican divorce

167
00:11:35,443 --> 00:11:40,073
and he did have, you know,
what he called another wife

168
00:11:40,181 --> 00:11:43,742
But we didn't recognize it It wasn't
recognized by the Catholic Church

169
00:11:43,852 --> 00:11:45,752
They don't recognize it, you know

170
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:50,185
Say, are you bossing me around, Edie?
All afternoon?

171
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:53,261
I think that's terrific
Oh, Edie, it's not the best one

172
00:11:53,361 --> 00:11:56,694
This is the worst one
of my wedding pictures

173
00:11:56,798 --> 00:11:59,232
The others look worse

174
00:11:59,334 --> 00:12:02,792
I was gonna be a singer, you know
A professional singer

175
00:12:02,904 --> 00:12:05,099
When I met Mr. Beale,
the jig was up

176
00:12:05,206 --> 00:12:07,106
Do you remember this?

177
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:10,905
May I see that, please?
The villain of the piece

178
00:12:11,012 --> 00:12:14,072
"To my best friend and
most delightful comrade

179
00:12:14,182 --> 00:12:17,242
"to my only sweetheart
and wonderful wife

180
00:12:17,352 --> 00:12:20,981
"I tender this likeness
of her husband

181
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:23,683
Phelan Beale, 1929"

182
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:26,386
So we did love each other
Did I laugh when I read that

183
00:12:26,494 --> 00:12:29,156
Aren't kids terrible?
I just roared

184
00:12:29,264 --> 00:12:32,722
When the people don't speak,
they never get divorced

185
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:35,803
You just can't tell
I've been a very happy woman all my life

186
00:12:35,904 --> 00:12:37,997
Shall I tell them about Gould?

187
00:12:38,106 --> 00:12:40,165
Gould was Mother's accompanist

188
00:12:40,275 --> 00:12:44,678
He was a boogie-woogie composer
who had the most terrific style

189
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:47,179
He was the most brilliant man
I've ever met

190
00:12:47,282 --> 00:12:49,842
That's including Mr. Beale
and Mr. Bouvier

191
00:12:49,951 --> 00:12:52,215
Completely brilliant

192
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,914
This is cute, Mother

193
00:12:55,023 --> 00:12:57,514
I like that very much
Don't you, David?

194
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,458
You said Michelle Beale
stole this, didn't you, Edie?

195
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:02,462
I never did
She'd never do that

196
00:13:02,564 --> 00:13:04,589
See how fat I was, Edie?

197
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:09,135
Did I look like a good mother?

198
00:13:09,237 --> 00:13:11,330
Was I a good mother?

199
00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:14,567
It looks like it
What? Looks like it

200
00:13:14,676 --> 00:13:18,168
I didn't starve my children,
did I? What?

201
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:20,213
Fed 'em Fed 'em well

202
00:13:20,315 --> 00:13:23,978
They were very nice children
I enjoyed them tremendously

203
00:13:24,085 --> 00:13:27,282
I'm crazy about my two sons,
absolutely mad about them

204
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,153
Who's the little girl?
That's me

205
00:13:30,258 --> 00:13:32,988
Well, the boys were,
were not hard to handle at all

206
00:13:33,094 --> 00:13:36,530
They were very easy to handle
Oh, my mother never saw my brothers

207
00:13:36,631 --> 00:13:39,031
I saw them every minute,
every single minute

208
00:13:39,134 --> 00:13:42,001
Oh, they never got any discipline, my brothers
They didn't need it

209
00:13:42,103 --> 00:13:44,663
They were absolutely perfect
They never got any discipline

210
00:13:44,773 --> 00:13:47,537
This was taken with a tiny
little Kodak Number Two

211
00:13:47,642 --> 00:13:51,703
That was Kodak Number Two
Cost two dollars, that camera

212
00:13:51,813 --> 00:13:54,714
Mother, I'm mad about these pictures of you
Oh, no, don't take those

213
00:13:54,816 --> 00:13:57,512
We'll just put them right over here
Oh, no, I want those out

214
00:13:57,619 --> 00:13:59,814
Will you give me those, please?
No, you can't have them

215
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:03,948
I want them, Edie I will never see them again
Now, I want those pictures

216
00:14:04,058 --> 00:14:07,459
I want those pictures, Edie
You can't expose them to the light in here

217
00:14:07,562 --> 00:14:11,054
No, give me those pictures
I don't want to ask 67 times

218
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,066
Come on
I want to show that to Al

219
00:14:13,168 --> 00:14:15,398
No, I want...
I wanna show it to Al!

220
00:14:15,503 --> 00:14:17,528
It's my picture
Look what you made me do

221
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:20,130
Well, you did it
Look what she did

222
00:14:20,241 --> 00:14:23,142
Mrs. Beale had a classical face I want you to see this
Look at what she did

223
00:14:23,244 --> 00:14:25,644
Look Very few people have this
Don't touch that!

224
00:14:25,747 --> 00:14:27,874
Al, I want you to see this

225
00:14:27,982 --> 00:14:32,885
[Edith Laughing]
Now look, this is my mother

226
00:14:32,987 --> 00:14:35,785
This British blood,
maybe Jewish, I don't know

227
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,256
In the Leaman family, I'm not sure

228
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:40,953
I don't want that photographed
Scotch blood... the Ewings

229
00:14:41,062 --> 00:14:45,499
Imagine showing those horrible things
I don't want you to show

230
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,194
But it's just a girl
from a good French family

231
00:14:48,303 --> 00:14:50,635
It's a very beautiful face

232
00:14:55,877 --> 00:14:59,779
I lived alone at least 30 years
l-I didn't mind

233
00:14:59,881 --> 00:15:03,180
You get very independent
when you live alone

234
00:15:03,284 --> 00:15:05,878
You get to be a real individual

235
00:15:05,987 --> 00:15:09,548
You can't have your cake and eat it too in life
Oh, yes, I did

236
00:15:09,657 --> 00:15:13,457
I did I had my cake, loved it,
masticated it, chewed it

237
00:15:13,561 --> 00:15:16,553
and had everything I wanted
You can't have your cake and eat it too

238
00:15:16,664 --> 00:15:19,360
I had a very, very happy,
satisfying life

239
00:15:19,467 --> 00:15:21,958
Well, you had a rich husband
You should have stayed with him

240
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,163
Now you might as well face it
What! For money?

241
00:15:24,272 --> 00:15:28,504
She was bored
Why, I was not I was a great singer

242
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,943
I had a perfect marriage,
beautiful children

243
00:15:32,046 --> 00:15:36,642
Terribly successful marriage
Never had a fight in my life

244
00:15:36,751 --> 00:15:40,312
I never threw anything at Mr. Beale Never
[Laughing]

245
00:15:40,421 --> 00:15:43,322
They threw the bull around,
as they say

246
00:15:43,424 --> 00:15:47,360
No, I never had any words
with Mr. Beale at all

247
00:15:47,462 --> 00:15:52,161
I came down here to live in this,
in this house because I did all my singing here

248
00:15:53,768 --> 00:15:58,501
I was so happy I was happier
going out and singing

249
00:15:58,606 --> 00:16:01,803
than anything I've ever done
since I was born

250
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:05,175
I liked it better
than anything I ever did

251
00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:11,851
I can't find it, Mother
Well, you could let me help you

252
00:16:11,953 --> 00:16:16,754
Let me...
Listen, kid I'm extremely organized

253
00:16:16,858 --> 00:16:20,089
I know exactly where
to look for this stuff

254
00:16:20,194 --> 00:16:23,994
I've got it under control
right here, but I can't find it

255
00:16:24,098 --> 00:16:26,293
Get it?

256
00:16:26,401 --> 00:16:31,031
Well, bring in the...
bring in the orchestration

257
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:33,232
of"Tea for Two"

258
00:16:33,341 --> 00:16:35,775
I can't do it
My feet hurt

259
00:16:35,877 --> 00:16:38,641
Just try, babe
They're beautiful

260
00:16:40,415 --> 00:16:45,148
I have to get my voice exactly back
the way it was when I was 45 years old

261
00:16:45,253 --> 00:16:47,949
You can't, Mother darling
Oh, yes, I can Oh, yes!

262
00:16:48,056 --> 00:16:51,617
Something happens, face it
I never strained my voice ever in my life

263
00:16:51,726 --> 00:16:54,490
Oh, but I strain my voice
from yelling and screaming

264
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,497
What is the matter with me?
I could never speak again

265
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,932
Why, I can get it back in about a month,
just about You know, good hard work

266
00:17:01,035 --> 00:17:04,436
(music) When we are together
together, hmmm (music)

267
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:07,838
Gould and Mother
made this record in 1934

268
00:17:07,942 --> 00:17:10,775
Sing it, babe, Just sing it
He was Mother's accompanist

269
00:17:10,878 --> 00:17:14,075

Oh, my heart, what happened?

280
00:17:56,391 --> 00:17:59,224
That's pretty, that note
Terrific

281
00:17:59,327 --> 00:18:01,557
Oh, that's terrible

282
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,893
Oh, I see It repeats

283
00:18:03,998 --> 00:18:06,967
Yes, that's very important,
that last

284
00:18:07,068 --> 00:18:10,162
That's the "cazenza,"
"cadenza," whatever you call it

285
00:18:10,271 --> 00:18:13,365
Do you want that?
Aren't you mad about your record?

286
00:18:13,474 --> 00:18:16,910
I was very serious
about my singing Loved it

287
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:20,412
After you hear that,
you realize nothing is...

288
00:18:20,515 --> 00:18:23,746
Important
No, it isn't Nothing

289
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:27,378
Well, my mother, you know, she gave me
the right slant on my voice

290
00:18:27,488 --> 00:18:30,013
She told me to leave everything,
to leave everything

291
00:18:30,124 --> 00:18:34,458
No man could compete
against Mrs. Beale and Gould

292
00:18:34,562 --> 00:18:37,053
We were pretty good
No man in the world

293
00:18:37,165 --> 00:18:41,465
Well, I worked hard
I wish you would play "Laura"

294
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:45,471
Imagine bothering about anything
when she had a talent like that?

295
00:18:45,573 --> 00:18:48,940
Well, I had to take care of this house
I lived on no money

296
00:18:50,545 --> 00:18:53,537
You were able to save
the house on account of me

297
00:18:53,648 --> 00:18:56,310
Yeah, I think that...
I didn't want to live in East Hampton

298
00:18:56,417 --> 00:18:58,942
but I had to on account
of Mother's house

299
00:18:59,053 --> 00:19:02,887
Well, now you see why you lived,
because you had music all the time

300
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,925
That's why
And you went to the beach too

301
00:19:06,027 --> 00:19:09,121
That's what you liked
Those are the only things

302
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,425
Well, I think
you liked your dancing

303
00:19:11,532 --> 00:19:15,024
You were very good at that

(music) No, no, no (music)

328
00:20:48,796 --> 00:20:52,823
(music) But I'll awake and start to bake (music)

329
00:20:52,934 --> 00:20:57,098
(music) A sug-sug-sugar cake-cake-cake (music)

330
00:20:57,205 --> 00:21:02,575
(music) See for all the boys to see (music)

331
00:21:04,512 --> 00:21:07,310
(music) We can raise a family (music)

332
00:21:07,415 --> 00:21:10,907
(music) A girl for you, a boy for me (music)

333
00:21:11,018 --> 00:21:13,282
(music) Oh, can't you see (music)

334
00:21:13,387 --> 00:21:18,324
(music) How happy we would be (music)

335
00:21:20,194 --> 00:21:24,096
Edie, dance to that
A waltz Come on Get Edie up

336
00:21:24,198 --> 00:21:28,294
Dance A waltz
How can you resist that?

337
00:21:28,402 --> 00:21:32,338
[Coughing]
How can you resist that?

338
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,466
(music) Oh, la-la (music)

339
00:21:35,576 --> 00:21:39,512
(music) La, da, ah, ah (music)

340
00:21:39,614 --> 00:21:42,981
(music) Oh, can't you see (music)

341
00:21:43,084 --> 00:21:45,575
(music) How happy (music)

342
00:21:45,686 --> 00:21:51,215
(music) We would be (music)

343
00:21:51,325 --> 00:21:56,991
(music) Would be (music)
Terrific Isn't that terrific?

344
00:21:57,098 --> 00:21:59,498
Isn't that a beautiful chord?

345
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,727
I'm mad about Kostelanetz

346
00:22:11,312 --> 00:22:15,146
[Laughing] Do you think
I'm gonna look funny dancing?

347
00:22:15,249 --> 00:22:17,945
[Both] No
I do terrific dances

348
00:22:18,052 --> 00:22:20,816
I only care about three things:

349
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:23,550
The Catholic Church,
swimming and dancing

350
00:22:23,658 --> 00:22:26,388
And I had to give them up
Dave, it opens from the bottom

351
00:22:26,494 --> 00:22:29,554
I've got enough I almost die
with the fleas in this place

352
00:22:29,664 --> 00:22:33,430
I can't go on another year
I have to get to a hotel room

353
00:22:33,534 --> 00:22:37,061
Well, I have... I brought
a lot of stuff for your fleas

354
00:22:37,171 --> 00:22:39,366
and I'll be more than willing
to put it down

355
00:22:39,473 --> 00:22:41,964
All I want is a little room

356
00:22:42,076 --> 00:22:46,035
[Laughing]
I can't stand a country house

357
00:22:46,147 --> 00:22:49,014
In the first place,
it makes me terribly nervous

358
00:22:49,116 --> 00:22:53,610
I'm scared to death of doors, locks,
people roaming around in the background

359
00:22:53,721 --> 00:22:55,814
under the trees, in the bushes

360
00:22:55,923 --> 00:22:58,118
I'm absolutely terrified

361
00:22:58,225 --> 00:23:01,854
I'm not a bit terrified
of the city, not a bit

362
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:04,431
I like the terrible noise
you hear at night

363
00:23:04,532 --> 00:23:07,467
and all these terrible
drilling sounds

364
00:23:07,568 --> 00:23:11,197
I never go to sleep unless
the whole pavement is jumping outside

365
00:23:11,305 --> 00:23:14,240
and it's a hundred degrees
and that drill is just going...

366
00:23:14,342 --> 00:23:17,505
[Makes Grunting Noise]
And then I just go to sleep

367
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,981
[Propeller Plane Overhead]

368
00:23:25,052 --> 00:23:29,580
[Laughs]
I only hope it stays up

369
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:33,456
(music) At the Balalaika (music)

370
00:23:33,561 --> 00:23:35,995
I haven't got my makeup on

371
00:23:36,097 --> 00:23:39,328
[Whispering] My God,
do you think it's gonna stay up?

372
00:23:39,433 --> 00:23:43,893
I feel something slipping
I feel something...

373
00:23:48,743 --> 00:23:50,643
[Edie]
What am I missing?

374
00:23:50,745 --> 00:23:55,114
We'll almost have to listen
to Peale in about five seconds

375
00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:59,175
She doesn't like the Catholic Church
She gets mad whenever I go

376
00:23:59,286 --> 00:24:02,517
Oh, go on What the hell?
I worship the Catholic Church

377
00:24:02,623 --> 00:24:06,184
I'm gonna invite Father Huntington over
to spend the whole entire night with me

378
00:24:06,293 --> 00:24:09,751
That's what I'm gonna do
I love the church so much

379
00:24:09,864 --> 00:24:13,027
[Giggles]

380
00:24:13,134 --> 00:24:15,967
[Radio Tuning]
Here it is

381
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:19,301
[Radio: Norman Vincent Peale]
To get on top of things and to stay there

382
00:24:19,407 --> 00:24:23,400
Does that mean women too?
For if you do not do this

383
00:24:25,246 --> 00:24:29,307
it is very likely that things
will get on top of you

384
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:31,385
Isn't he terrific?

385
00:24:31,485 --> 00:24:36,388
And since I always believe
in a simple formula that is workable

386
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:39,357
I have a formula for you now

387
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:44,159
First: Try, really try

388
00:24:44,265 --> 00:24:46,165
Try, really try

389
00:24:46,267 --> 00:24:50,863
Second: Think, really think

390
00:24:50,971 --> 00:24:52,905
Cute Think, really think

391
00:24:53,007 --> 00:24:57,842
And third: Believe, really believe

392
00:24:57,945 --> 00:25:01,312
[Radio Tuning]
Well, you may say, "How many times

393
00:25:01,415 --> 00:25:04,509
Why, it may be a good many times

394
00:25:04,618 --> 00:25:09,180
For example, I have in my pocket here
a letter from a man in London, England

395
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:12,487
"Dear Dr Peale,
Over three years ago

396
00:25:12,593 --> 00:25:15,653
"I was in your great Marble
Collegiate Church for the first time

397
00:25:15,763 --> 00:25:19,130
"and I was having it rough

398
00:25:19,233 --> 00:25:22,999
[Snickers]
"The job I'd been doing

399
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:25,629
[Laughing]
Your age, old gal

400
00:25:25,739 --> 00:25:28,640
"Your suggestion lived with me,
plus the advice to try, really try, :

401
00:25:28,742 --> 00:25:32,200
He lived I never lived
"think, really think, : Believe, really believe

402
00:25:32,313 --> 00:25:37,307
"I did think I did work
very hard to find a job

403
00:25:37,418 --> 00:25:41,514
Eighty-eight interviews"

404
00:25:41,622 --> 00:25:44,318
So did he
or did he not get the job?

405
00:25:44,425 --> 00:25:46,518
He did

406
00:25:46,627 --> 00:25:49,596
Will he or will he not
handle himself

407
00:25:49,697 --> 00:25:52,530
in the years that are to come?

408
00:25:52,633 --> 00:25:55,500
He wasn't emotional

409
00:25:55,603 --> 00:25:58,538
He didn't get upset

410
00:25:58,639 --> 00:26:02,040
He wasn't nervous
He wasn't me

411
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:07,046
He was cool
Now one thing is sure:

412
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:12,882
The human mind will not function
when it is hot

413
00:26:15,089 --> 00:26:20,652
Only when it is cool and dispassionate
Dispassionate

414
00:26:20,761 --> 00:26:23,025
That was the word I wanted to other day
will it produce

415
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,462
I couldn't think of what it was

416
00:26:25,566 --> 00:26:29,093
I think it would be a good idea
if every day every individual

417
00:26:29,203 --> 00:26:32,172
would look at himself
in the mirror

418
00:26:32,273 --> 00:26:36,073
earnestly, and ask the question

419
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:40,045
"Who am I?
Am I a weak person?

420
00:26:40,147 --> 00:26:44,174
Am I a defeated person?
Am I an inferior person?"

421
00:26:44,285 --> 00:26:46,810
Not at all

422
00:26:46,921 --> 00:26:50,584
I am a child of God

423
00:26:50,691 --> 00:26:55,719
and I was intended
to get on top of things

424
00:26:55,829 --> 00:27:00,630
and I was intended to stay there

425
00:27:02,736 --> 00:27:06,297
(music) Amen, amen (music)
Very good That was very long

426
00:27:06,407 --> 00:27:09,433
Very long
You notice how he went on and on and on?

427
00:27:09,543 --> 00:27:13,206
Let's hear the prayer
I mean the song You sing the song now

428
00:27:13,314 --> 00:27:15,373
Doxology
Sing it

429
00:27:15,482 --> 00:27:17,848
[Announcer] You have been listening
to Dr Norman Vincent Peale

430
00:27:17,952 --> 00:27:20,944
as he spoke this morning from his pulpit
No emotionalism

431
00:27:21,055 --> 00:27:24,354
at Marble Collegiate Church
Never give up You want to keep on top

432
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:27,291
Way up high up on top

433
00:27:27,394 --> 00:27:29,692
Wonderful way to smother somebody

434
00:27:29,797 --> 00:27:33,130
[Laughing] Would you pass
your mirror over here?

435
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:36,397
I've got to see what I look like

436
00:27:36,503 --> 00:27:40,030
[Laughing]
Don't drop it

437
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:45,742
Uptight
That was wonderful

438
00:27:45,846 --> 00:27:48,337
I see why I've got cataracts

439
00:27:48,449 --> 00:27:50,713
I have astigmatism,
one eye pulled against the other

440
00:27:50,818 --> 00:27:52,979
and I should've worn glasses
and I didn't

441
00:27:53,087 --> 00:27:55,647
Oh, I told you to wear glasses
Is there anything else you want to know?

442
00:27:55,756 --> 00:27:58,657
You got with the glasses about four years ago
I'll tell you about my teeth

443
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:02,160
Four years ago, Edie You got
the glasses, and you didn't wear them

444
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:05,858
My teeth are still all right
You have to wear the glasses

445
00:28:05,966 --> 00:28:08,161
You have to

446
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,260
[Laughs]

447
00:28:10,371 --> 00:28:15,240
And my hair will grow
I hope Here

448
00:28:21,382 --> 00:28:23,407
[David]
You're dressed for battle, Edie

449
00:28:23,517 --> 00:28:27,476
Mother's telling Marjorie how
spoiled I am, how terrible I am

450
00:28:27,588 --> 00:28:30,716
And Marjorie knew my father
and my uncle and everybody

451
00:28:30,824 --> 00:28:33,122
Mother's giving her
all this S-H-l-T

452
00:28:33,227 --> 00:28:36,424
so I went and told her
some things about the family

453
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:39,863
But, you see, in dealing with me

454
00:28:39,967 --> 00:28:43,130
the relatives didn't know

455
00:28:43,237 --> 00:28:46,570
that they were dealing
with a staunch character

456
00:28:46,674 --> 00:28:50,440
And I tell you, if there's anything
worse than a staunch woman...

457
00:28:50,544 --> 00:28:54,310
S-T-A-U-N-C-H

458
00:28:54,415 --> 00:28:57,384
There's nothing worse,
I'm telling you

459
00:28:57,484 --> 00:28:59,577
[Sighs]

460
00:28:59,687 --> 00:29:03,384
They don't weaken no matter what

461
00:29:05,626 --> 00:29:10,154
But they didn't know that
Well, how were they to know?

462
00:29:10,264 --> 00:29:14,701
You know, my father had made up his mind
about what Farmington produced

463
00:29:14,802 --> 00:29:17,236
and what the
Sacred Heart Convent produced

464
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:20,068
I don't think he was so down
on the Spence School

465
00:29:20,174 --> 00:29:22,734
but he certainly was down
on Farmington

466
00:29:22,843 --> 00:29:25,641
I don't know why
Farmington was a junior college

467
00:29:25,746 --> 00:29:28,180
You could choose
what you wanted to study

468
00:29:28,282 --> 00:29:30,944
Perhaps that was what made
my father dislike it so...

469
00:29:31,051 --> 00:29:33,019
that I could choose

470
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,317
But I chose what I thought
he'd want me to choose...

471
00:29:36,423 --> 00:29:39,620
you know, English literature and

472
00:29:39,727 --> 00:29:43,060
Oriental philosophies and, uh

473
00:29:43,163 --> 00:29:47,122
well, I always took French,
but nothing ever happened there

474
00:29:47,234 --> 00:29:50,635
I can read and write in French,
but I can't speak it

475
00:29:50,738 --> 00:29:54,902
I had years and years
and years of French

476
00:29:55,008 --> 00:29:57,272
Terrible
[Laughs]

477
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:04,108
This was taken by Amy Dupont
my last year in Farmington

478
00:30:04,218 --> 00:30:06,152
I was 17

479
00:30:06,253 --> 00:30:08,915
Edie, that's so beautiful
Mr. Wainwright did that

480
00:30:09,022 --> 00:30:13,049
He was an artist from a very good
family He was in the social register

481
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:17,654
He did it in the solarium
of Grey Gardens

482
00:30:17,765 --> 00:30:20,893
David, look at this
I was in a fashion show

483
00:30:21,001 --> 00:30:23,492
[Laughs]
Let me see that

484
00:30:23,604 --> 00:30:25,572
[Albert]
Oh, beautiful Look at that, David

485
00:30:25,672 --> 00:30:27,970
May I see that?
Wow! Look at that

486
00:30:28,075 --> 00:30:30,669
I thought I was
the cat's pajamas in that!

487
00:30:30,778 --> 00:30:34,077
You did, Edie See how
pretty Edie was when she was young?

488
00:30:34,181 --> 00:30:37,014
It's perfectly foolish of her
not to look that way now

489
00:30:37,117 --> 00:30:40,644
She could, you know, if she
didn't worry about everything

490
00:30:40,754 --> 00:30:44,417
Didn't she look like a girl
that had everything? Huh?

491
00:30:46,126 --> 00:30:48,026
[Edie]
This has inspired me

492
00:30:48,128 --> 00:30:51,393
I'll have to get another
brown tailored suit and grow my hair

493
00:30:51,498 --> 00:30:53,989
My God, I have no hair

494
00:30:54,101 --> 00:30:57,696
You never put any
lipstick on for this picture, did you?

495
00:30:57,805 --> 00:31:01,036
I have another kind on
You look horrible

496
00:31:01,141 --> 00:31:03,541
Why didn't you put
lipstick and makeup on?

497
00:31:03,644 --> 00:31:06,545
Mr. Beale smashed
the window of Burt Bacharach

498
00:31:06,647 --> 00:31:09,844
when he put this in the window
on upper Madison Avenue

499
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:12,578
For God's sakes
He offered me a job

500
00:31:12,686 --> 00:31:15,280
He didn't say to get out
of that family situation

501
00:31:15,389 --> 00:31:18,222
but he said,
"You need a job, Miss Beale"

502
00:31:20,227 --> 00:31:23,162
Didn't you expect that Edie
might get married someday?

503
00:31:23,263 --> 00:31:25,322
[Mrs. Beale]
Oh, I did I wanted her to

504
00:31:25,432 --> 00:31:28,162
Oh, I picked out some nice men
She didn't like the men I picked out

505
00:31:28,268 --> 00:31:30,168
[Edie]
They were horrible

506
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,670
She could have married
this Gerald Getty

507
00:31:32,773 --> 00:31:35,264
He was a millionaire, :
He gave her a gorgeous ring

508
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:38,538
She decided not to marry that guy
She had to give the ring back

509
00:31:38,645 --> 00:31:41,773
She has a proposal of marriage
from Paul Getty

510
00:31:41,882 --> 00:31:44,350
Remember Paul,
the richest man in the world?

511
00:31:44,451 --> 00:31:46,351
[Edie]
He married Teddy Lynch

512
00:31:46,453 --> 00:31:48,683
Then you could
have married Jordan McClanahan

513
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:51,451
He was another millionaire,
and he wanted to marry you

514
00:31:51,558 --> 00:31:54,959
She just didn't want to get married
That's all blamed on me

515
00:31:55,062 --> 00:31:57,690
[Edie]
No, I never fell in love until I was 31

516
00:31:57,798 --> 00:32:00,028
Well, how old
are you in these pictures?

517
00:32:00,133 --> 00:32:02,192
Twenty-four
Twenty-four That old?

518
00:32:02,302 --> 00:32:04,702
1940
Very young looking for twenty-four

519
00:32:04,805 --> 00:32:07,831
France had just fallen
to Hitler

520
00:32:07,941 --> 00:32:10,808
But you never fell for a man
Paris, Paris, excuse me

521
00:32:10,911 --> 00:32:13,778
France fell, but Edie didn't fall

522
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:19,584
That was the thing
See, l...

523
00:32:19,686 --> 00:32:22,177
They didn't tell us that
when we studied World War I

524
00:32:22,289 --> 00:32:25,452
that everything was so awful
with the Versailles Treaty

525
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:29,962
that we were soon going to get into
something four years after I got out

526
00:32:30,063 --> 00:32:33,055
If I'd only known it,
I would have just...

527
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:36,829
just enjoyed every single minute,
just done everything

528
00:32:36,937 --> 00:32:39,735
It must've been tough
on people I remember as a kid

529
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,172
so many loved ones being killed

530
00:32:42,276 --> 00:32:44,335
But you were the dating age

531
00:32:44,444 --> 00:32:46,935
A lot of my friends went
overseas and got married

532
00:32:47,047 --> 00:32:50,107
They went in the Red Cross
They went to India, Australia

533
00:32:50,217 --> 00:32:52,515
They all got married

534
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:56,180
One of my best friends
went to Australia

535
00:32:56,290 --> 00:33:00,727
If I'd have been able to go, she
might have persuaded me to go with her

536
00:33:00,827 --> 00:33:03,796
And she met somebody
in the hospital

537
00:33:03,897 --> 00:33:08,994
She was working for the Red Cross,
and she never came back to New York

538
00:33:09,102 --> 00:33:11,832
But I never had a chance
to do anything like that

539
00:33:11,939 --> 00:33:14,737
'cause Mother wasn't well
during the war

540
00:33:14,841 --> 00:33:18,038
She had her eye operation

541
00:33:18,145 --> 00:33:20,613
I missed out on everything

542
00:33:20,714 --> 00:33:24,946
I missed out on the reunion
of my graduating class in Farmington

543
00:33:25,052 --> 00:33:29,386
because that was the fall that
Jack Kennedy campaigned to get in

544
00:33:29,489 --> 00:33:33,858
and I was stuck here with Mother,
the cats, the house and T Logan

545
00:33:33,961 --> 00:33:35,861
and I couldn't go

546
00:33:35,963 --> 00:33:40,627
No, you said you didn't want them
to know how old you were

547
00:33:40,734 --> 00:33:44,067
No, I think...
"Well, I didn't want them

548
00:33:44,171 --> 00:33:49,040
No, I would have enjoyed that, Mother,
because Jack Kennedy campaigned to get in and won

549
00:33:49,142 --> 00:33:52,669
Get in the Farmington School?
That'd be a good place for him

550
00:33:52,779 --> 00:33:55,839
I don't know I think
it would have been a lot of fun

551
00:33:55,949 --> 00:33:59,077
Yeah, everything's good
that you didn't do

552
00:33:59,186 --> 00:34:01,814
At the time, you didn't want it

553
00:34:01,922 --> 00:34:04,356
I couldn't get away
Well, that's the choice

554
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:08,121
You can't go back and say...
feel gorgeous right now

555
00:34:08,228 --> 00:34:11,026
and say, "Oh, why didn't I do this?"
I couldn't leave

556
00:34:11,131 --> 00:34:14,532
Because you didn't feel then
the way you do now

557
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:19,231
Everybody thinks and feels differently
as the years go by, don't they?

558
00:34:19,339 --> 00:34:21,239
Yeah
Yes

559
00:34:21,341 --> 00:34:23,866
What time is it, chickens?
What time is it?

560
00:34:23,977 --> 00:34:25,968
I want to go in now
It's, uh, 1:30

561
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,741
I may need David's hand to get up
You have it

562
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:31,875
Where is it?
Can you come around this way?

563
00:34:31,985 --> 00:34:34,078
Sure
Are you taking pictures?

564
00:34:34,187 --> 00:34:37,281
Always Here

565
00:34:37,391 --> 00:34:40,724
[Edie]
"Two roads diverged in yellow wood

566
00:34:40,827 --> 00:34:46,265
"and pondering, pondering both
or pondering each...

567
00:34:46,366 --> 00:34:50,826
"pondering one I took the other

568
00:34:50,937 --> 00:34:53,269
and that made all the difference"

569
00:34:53,373 --> 00:34:55,773
Robert Frost
Isn't that wonderful?

570
00:34:55,876 --> 00:34:58,845
Did he say that?
That's all you need... just three lines like that

571
00:34:58,945 --> 00:35:01,846
Come on, Edie, is that Robert Frost?
Who else?

572
00:35:01,948 --> 00:35:04,178
I thought it was you
I think your poetry is better

573
00:35:04,284 --> 00:35:06,684
"Two road diverged in yellow wood
Come on, you said that

574
00:35:06,787 --> 00:35:10,245
We want something else
"and pondering one, I took the other

575
00:35:10,357 --> 00:35:13,520
Edie, you're not teaching us
and that made all the difference"

576
00:35:13,627 --> 00:35:16,460
We don't want to learn it It's very pretty
Isn't that amazing?

577
00:35:16,563 --> 00:35:18,895
No, I don't think it's
half as good as your poems

578
00:35:18,999 --> 00:35:22,901
They looked the same, and he probably
couldn't tell and yet he...

579
00:35:23,003 --> 00:35:26,700
I wish I could remember
the correct lines

580
00:35:37,884 --> 00:35:41,115
I'm absolutely exhausted
I danced eight hours last night

581
00:35:41,221 --> 00:35:44,418
practicing the, uh...
the marching song

582
00:35:44,524 --> 00:35:46,822
[Albert] Great
My God, my muscles!

583
00:35:46,927 --> 00:35:50,658
I can't do it, I'm telling you
What am I gonna do?

584
00:35:50,764 --> 00:35:54,393
They're gone
with this soft life

585
00:35:54,501 --> 00:35:56,833
[Laughing]

586
00:35:56,937 --> 00:36:00,839
(music) We all march together
for love is behind (music)

587
00:36:00,941 --> 00:36:04,775
(music) We all stand together
United we die (music)

588
00:36:04,878 --> 00:36:08,177
(music) We all march together
for we love the land (music)

589
00:36:08,281 --> 00:36:11,250
(music) It's the spirit of VMI (music)

590
00:36:11,351 --> 00:36:15,253
(music) We all march together
for life is unkind (music)

591
00:36:15,355 --> 00:36:17,516
[Laughing]

592
00:36:17,624 --> 00:36:22,391
When they do that, that's
when the plane goes by, see?

593
00:36:22,496 --> 00:36:24,828
So I'm doing
the VMI marching song

594
00:36:24,931 --> 00:36:27,195
which is a ground maneuver

595
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:31,100
Anyway, I've got to get it all
coordinated in my mind

596
00:36:36,676 --> 00:36:40,703
Hey, Mother,
I'm working on my dance

597
00:36:40,814 --> 00:36:43,544
I'm starving
(music) We all march together (music)

598
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:46,414
(music) For life is unkind (music)
You see, she doesn't want to eat

599
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,647
so I have to sit here
and starve all the time

600
00:36:48,755 --> 00:36:51,622
How can I eat and look sexy too?
I think I lost five pounds

601
00:36:51,725 --> 00:36:54,489
I'm gonna die
Well, don't live with me I want to eat

602
00:36:54,594 --> 00:36:58,462
Will you eat some liver pate?
It's not awfully good

603
00:36:58,565 --> 00:37:01,728
lf you put lemon with it, it's all right
I'm gonna die with this diet

604
00:37:01,835 --> 00:37:05,396
I don't like it at all
Don't do it Have a sandwich

605
00:37:05,505 --> 00:37:08,269
I got fat not wearing
clothes for two years

606
00:37:08,375 --> 00:37:12,243
Oh, that wasn't it at all It was
the quarts and quarts of ice cream

607
00:37:12,345 --> 00:37:15,872
My bill was $ 171 just for ice cream

608
00:37:15,982 --> 00:37:19,383
Here's your liver pate
You have to make it I can't No, I can't

609
00:37:19,486 --> 00:37:22,819
I ate in front of the Maysles
the other day You have to make it

610
00:37:22,923 --> 00:37:26,324
I was very embarrassed No
I ate all that chicken...

611
00:37:26,426 --> 00:37:30,294
Oh, Mother, I should have stolen that blue...
Take it out, babe

612
00:37:30,397 --> 00:37:33,560
You like the green?
That's chartreuse there

613
00:37:33,667 --> 00:37:36,693
What do I do with this?
You have crackers somewhere

614
00:37:36,803 --> 00:37:39,499
Should I put it on crackers?
Yeah You should...

615
00:37:39,606 --> 00:37:42,131
It needs a lemon
or mayonnaise or something

616
00:37:42,242 --> 00:37:44,767
When am I gonna get out of here?

617
00:37:44,878 --> 00:37:48,279
[Laughing]
Oh, she's always talking like that

618
00:37:48,381 --> 00:37:52,283
When I get to New York, you're never
gonna get me back to East Hampton

619
00:37:52,385 --> 00:37:55,650
Oh, that's silly Oh, Edie, that isn't nice
Ever Never!

620
00:37:55,755 --> 00:37:58,690
Edie, the man is doing this
For goodness sakes! That's terrible!

621
00:37:58,792 --> 00:38:01,420
When I get to New York, brother,
I'm not ever coming back

622
00:38:01,528 --> 00:38:05,157
Well, you got in awful trouble there
It's a good thing you had a place to come to

623
00:38:05,265 --> 00:38:08,757
Recuperate at Mama's for about 15 to 20 years
[Edie Grumbling]

624
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:13,033
She had a horrible time I used to
have to send her big boxes of groceries

625
00:38:13,139 --> 00:38:16,074
She was starving
From my grocer's thing down there

626
00:38:16,176 --> 00:38:19,373
I was discovered
Sent her big boxes of groceries

627
00:38:19,479 --> 00:38:22,642
but I needed training
And I always put a bottle of wine in her bag

628
00:38:22,749 --> 00:38:24,944
I thought she'd have
a terrible accident

629
00:38:25,051 --> 00:38:28,316
Well, I was discovered, but...
well, never mind

630
00:38:28,421 --> 00:38:32,118
Oh, I wouldn't say anything good
happened to you in New York

631
00:38:32,225 --> 00:38:34,659
Are you kidding?
No

632
00:38:34,761 --> 00:38:37,662
I was discovered by Mr. Gordon
He was a friend of Mrs.

633
00:38:37,764 --> 00:38:40,358
Well, what is it?
What was that woman's name?

634
00:38:40,467 --> 00:38:43,561
People discover me every time I go out, but
What was Ruby Chapman's...

635
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:46,537
I don't think anything of it
This is serious! He went to pieces!

636
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,939
Mr. Max Gordon went out of his mind
Oh, not Max Gordon

637
00:38:50,043 --> 00:38:52,739
He never went to pieces in his life
He did!

638
00:38:52,846 --> 00:38:55,906
He did not A very...
Now, what was the woman's name?

639
00:38:56,016 --> 00:38:58,712
She gave me the letter
Mrs. Hitchcock

640
00:38:58,818 --> 00:39:01,719
I can't go back to ancient history
Ruby Chapman's partner!

641
00:39:01,821 --> 00:39:04,722
How can you remember so long?
Now I'll have to get drunk

642
00:39:04,824 --> 00:39:07,793
They gave me the letter to Max Gordon
I'll have to start drinking

643
00:39:07,894 --> 00:39:12,228
I can't take it Ah, she'll make
a drunkard out of her mother

644
00:39:12,332 --> 00:39:15,495
What crackers do you want? We'll take these
Do you mind? They're very good

645
00:39:15,602 --> 00:39:18,969
Do you want these?
I don't like crackers You know that

646
00:39:19,072 --> 00:39:21,097
Just put a lemon on it
Little lemon

647
00:39:21,207 --> 00:39:23,675
Don't you know who Max Gordon is?

648
00:39:23,777 --> 00:39:25,745
He's a famous producer

649
00:39:25,845 --> 00:39:28,313
You've heard of him, haven't you?

650
00:39:28,415 --> 00:39:31,509
He discovered Judy Holliday
[Mrs. Beale, Indistinct]

651
00:39:31,618 --> 00:39:34,781
He discovered Judy Holliday
He said I was much funnier

652
00:39:34,888 --> 00:39:37,413
Well, you haven't
been funny today, boy

653
00:39:37,524 --> 00:39:39,822
You're lacking in humor

654

It's how you are
when you grow older

655
00:39:43,396 --> 00:39:47,298
I needed training
Where was I to get the training?

656
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,460

what I should have done

Here, could you put this
away, please, Edie?

661
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:06,817
I should have immediately
tried to get into something?

662
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,820
Until it gets frozen, will you?

663
00:40:08,922 --> 00:40:12,323
David, instead of coming home

664
00:40:12,425 --> 00:40:15,223
I should have tried to get into
something, is that it?

665
00:40:15,328 --> 00:40:18,820
David, do you think you and Al
should have told Edie to lose weight?

666
00:40:18,932 --> 00:40:22,527
She's been impossible
Do you think I should have

[David]
What does your mother think?

668
00:40:25,138 --> 00:40:27,834
I had everything picked out
My father was alive!

669
00:40:27,941 --> 00:40:30,842
That was it My father was alive
I was going around with a...

670
00:40:30,944 --> 00:40:33,674
My father was alive
Do you want to hear what I have to say?

671
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:36,146
Mr. Beale would have
had me committed

672
00:40:36,249 --> 00:40:38,945
Gould and I were at Edie
every day to go to Traphagen

673
00:40:39,052 --> 00:40:41,850
She could do anything
She could learn toe dancing

674
00:40:41,955 --> 00:40:45,789
She could learn radio She could learn
all sorts of stage dancing

675
00:40:45,892 --> 00:40:48,122
Why was I gonna do this?
She could do...

676
00:40:48,228 --> 00:40:51,288
The things we told you
We told you to go to Bendel's

677
00:40:51,398 --> 00:40:54,299
I couldn't go with my mother sitting here, David
and model earrings

678
00:40:54,401 --> 00:40:57,495
I couldn't go with my mother sitting here
You were so gorgeous in hats

679
00:40:57,604 --> 00:41:01,267
and you had such a beautiful
face and we always adored you

680
00:41:01,374 --> 00:41:04,832
And we said, "Why, she should do hats,"
and she had gorgeous feet

681
00:41:04,944 --> 00:41:09,142
And Mr. Beale always made her wear
a certain kind of shoe when she was a little girl

682
00:41:09,249 --> 00:41:11,308
Orthopedic shoe
And she, she could have...

683
00:41:11,418 --> 00:41:14,512
I had deep responsibility
for you, Mother

684
00:41:14,621 --> 00:41:17,647
I was taken care of for 25 years!

I don't enjoy it

here to take care of my mother

I'm sick and tired of worrying
about her night and day

Well, I had a very good...
I was away from her for five or six years

707
00:43:49,842 --> 00:43:54,006
I had a very good man
And I was sick and tired of lying awake at night

708
00:43:54,113 --> 00:43:57,173
He took care of me for 25 years
wondering what was happening to my mother

709
00:43:57,283 --> 00:43:59,581
She didn't have to worry

710

Who was the man
that took care of you for 25 years?

Nobody took care of her for 25 years

of by any man but my father

I think Al was referring to Gould

Yes, he was

717
00:44:21,808 --> 00:44:26,711
He took care of Mother by accompanying
her to the movies and playing the piano

718
00:44:26,813 --> 00:44:28,872
Took care of me and the washing...

719
00:44:28,982 --> 00:44:32,941
No one took care of Mrs. Beale She had
my father's money and her own money

What money?
The Bouvier money

721
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:39,619
And another thing, Mrs. Beale
wasn't taken care of sexually

722
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:44,958
I think he was nicer than anybody
I've ever known in my whole life

723
00:44:45,064 --> 00:44:48,192
He was a writer
He wrote seven books at one time

He was brilliant And he played
the piano magnificently

725

and composed exquisite music
and dedicated about 80 songs to me

No, she didn't have to worry the way she did, no

in New York long enough

But I didn't want to leave

Oh, no, you were not

to give you any chance at all

on this, 'cause it's just nuts

I thought you should come home

to come back in March of 1952

738
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:40,512
and she kept it up
until the end of July

739
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:43,555
And July 29th, I check out, got on the train

I don't know, Mother

771
00:47:59,091 --> 00:48:01,992
That's what I'm wondering
Don't you think you'd better find him?

772
00:48:02,094 --> 00:48:04,995
Mother wants me to watch him
the whole time he's in the house

773
00:48:05,097 --> 00:48:07,998
No, you told me not to have him back here
Like I watched Tom

774
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:12,434
No, thanks
My eyes dropped out Mother and her friends

775
00:48:12,538 --> 00:48:16,235
I never cared for the three
people that my mother liked

776
00:48:16,342 --> 00:48:18,572
I couldn't get on with Mr. Beale

777
00:48:18,678 --> 00:48:20,805
and I didn't care
for her composer friend

778
00:48:20,913 --> 00:48:23,905
and as for Tom Logan,
he drove me crazy in the house

779
00:48:24,016 --> 00:48:27,884
I loved Tom
He played the guitar so beautifully

780
00:48:27,987 --> 00:48:31,684
He sang and was in a rodeo,
and even was in Hollywood

781
00:48:31,791 --> 00:48:33,986
You'd have to admire
somebody like that

782
00:48:34,093 --> 00:48:36,357
She was a pushover
He had no place to go

783
00:48:36,462 --> 00:48:39,920
And then he asked my mother, he said,
"I've just been fired from the Sea Spray

784
00:48:40,032 --> 00:48:43,092
Would you like a maintenance man?"
Mother took him home

785
00:48:43,202 --> 00:48:46,763
I didn't want a maintenance man
I said, "I'll take you home for one night"

786
00:48:46,873 --> 00:48:50,070
That's the story of Tom Logan
That's what I said

787
00:48:50,176 --> 00:48:52,542
There wasn't a thing
he didn't know how to do

788
00:48:52,645 --> 00:48:54,704
He could fix anything

789
00:48:54,814 --> 00:48:58,477
Lights, plumber things

790
00:48:58,584 --> 00:49:02,645
He knew how to do everything
Just one of those terribly clever men

791
00:49:02,755 --> 00:49:06,748
He couldn't do any work He made good
salads, but he was drunk all the time

792
00:49:06,859 --> 00:49:10,818
Oh, no He came up here every morning
at 6:00, knocked on my door

793
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:16,027
We talked over the menu for the day

794
00:49:16,135 --> 00:49:21,437
Including a half a bottle
of rose vin

795
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:23,566
or wine or whatever it's called

796
00:49:23,676 --> 00:49:26,144
Naturally, we couldn't get rid
of him, and I had to stay here

797
00:49:26,245 --> 00:49:29,146
What I should have done is leave,
and he would have left right away

798
00:49:29,248 --> 00:49:32,274
All right, you don't believe
in religious compulsion It was a religious thing

799
00:49:32,385 --> 00:49:34,910
If I had left, he would have left
No, I deserve...

800
00:49:35,021 --> 00:49:37,922
Because the work would have been too much
He didn't want to go

801
00:49:38,024 --> 00:49:41,892
All alone in the house for Tom
All I had to do was leave I'm so stupid that I...

802
00:49:41,994 --> 00:49:44,895
Well, where would I have been?
I'd have been all alone in the house

803
00:49:44,997 --> 00:49:47,056
I think you would have, Mother

804

To hell with the Marble Faun

815
00:50:30,576 --> 00:50:33,010
Hello?
Hello, Edie

816
00:50:33,112 --> 00:50:35,979
Oh, hello, jerry darling
Do you want to come in?

817
00:50:36,082 --> 00:50:39,677
I just came for the faucet
so I can get down to the hardware store

818
00:50:39,785 --> 00:50:43,243
Yeah, Mother said you called
Was that you on the phone very early?

819
00:50:43,356 --> 00:50:45,790
How are you?
I'm looking at you now

820
00:50:45,891 --> 00:50:47,791
Really well

821
00:50:47,893 --> 00:50:50,361
I'll come down and let you in
Do you want to come up here?

822
00:50:50,463 --> 00:50:52,693
You want to come up?
All right, for a moment

823
00:50:52,798 --> 00:50:56,700
Mother's screaming to have me
let you in I'd better do it

824
00:50:56,802 --> 00:50:58,861
I'll be at the back door
here, okay?

825
00:50:58,971 --> 00:51:01,064
I'll come right down

826
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:12,178
jerry's puffing and blowing
No I'm tired, and I don't want to get any tireder.

827
00:51:12,284 --> 00:51:16,380
What do you want, jerry?
Who wants a nice piece of corn?

828
00:51:16,489 --> 00:51:18,650
No I don't want any
Thank you

829
00:51:18,758 --> 00:51:21,318
Jerry, you didn't get
enough to eat tonight

830
00:51:21,427 --> 00:51:24,157
Well, I can't resist I'm sorry
The margarine

831
00:51:24,263 --> 00:51:27,027
Jerry, you're gonna put
some of this on, aren't you?

832
00:51:27,133 --> 00:51:31,001
You wanna do it for me?
Why, yeah The pleasure's all mine

833
00:51:31,103 --> 00:51:33,401
If I don't burn myself

834
00:51:33,506 --> 00:51:36,236
Which piece of corn
do you want, jerry?

835
00:51:36,342 --> 00:51:39,675
Doesn't matter
See how polite he is?

836
00:51:39,779 --> 00:51:42,680
You want some, Edie?
Where's your plate, Jerry, for it?

837
00:51:42,782 --> 00:51:46,115
I couldn't eat in front of the camera
I've got very big hands

838
00:51:46,218 --> 00:51:49,619
[Edie Laughs]
This corn is out of this world

839
00:51:49,722 --> 00:51:55,422
Oh, did I do it nicely? He always
compliments me on the way I do my corn

840
00:51:55,528 --> 00:51:58,019
[Mrs. Beale Chuckles]

841
00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:00,189
[Clattering]
There they are

842
00:52:00,299 --> 00:52:05,202
There are your raccoons Run away
from your drinks and do that to your raccoons

843
00:52:16,315 --> 00:52:18,647
[Albert]
Hear him?

844
00:52:18,751 --> 00:52:21,151
[Edie]
Yeah, he's there I can hear him

845
00:52:23,089 --> 00:52:26,149
Everything's in the attic,
everything from sloths, otters

846
00:52:26,258 --> 00:52:30,490
badgers, uh, possums, raccoons

847
00:52:32,665 --> 00:52:35,498
I don't leave the bags anymore

848
00:52:35,601 --> 00:52:41,039
'Cause I had to get up to 200
cellophane bags this, uh...

849
00:52:44,143 --> 00:52:48,807
Horrors Somebody's removing
the books from my room

850
00:52:48,914 --> 00:52:51,007
Where did this little book
come from?

851
00:52:51,117 --> 00:52:53,017
[Jerry]
Edie!

852
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,054
[Mrs. Beale]
That's Jerry He locked himself out

853
00:52:56,155 --> 00:52:58,783
No, jerry hasn't locked himself out

854
00:52:58,891 --> 00:53:00,791
[Chuckles]
He locked himself out

855
00:53:00,893 --> 00:53:03,794
[Mrs. Beale]
Who's knocking at the door?

856
00:53:03,896 --> 00:53:05,864
[Jerry]
Who is it?

857
00:53:05,965 --> 00:53:07,865
[Whispering]
He's around there

858
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:13,405
Who got this book out of my room?
I cleaned this whole attic up the other day

859
00:53:13,506 --> 00:53:17,237
Now, who's been dropping books
around is what I want to know

860
00:53:17,343 --> 00:53:20,039
I would have seen that book

861
00:53:20,146 --> 00:53:23,741
He evidently has been
up in that room reading it

862
00:53:34,827 --> 00:53:38,558
All right, Buster, old pal,
come and get it

863
00:53:38,664 --> 00:53:41,565
There's somebody
knocking at the door, Edie

864
00:53:41,667 --> 00:53:43,931
Yeah, all right, Mother

865
00:53:44,036 --> 00:53:47,233
[Heavy Knocking]
Yes?

866
00:53:47,339 --> 00:53:49,967
[Man]
Is Jerry here?

867
00:53:50,075 --> 00:53:54,068
Oh, yes I'll get him for you
Just a minute Hey, jerry

868
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:58,276
Yeah?
I think your friend's in the, in the, uh, front

869
00:54:02,855 --> 00:54:05,949
I found a little book
dropped in the attic, Mother

870
00:54:06,058 --> 00:54:10,017
He's been up there
Well, you should keep him out

871
00:54:10,129 --> 00:54:13,223
He told me he was working
on that thing, : He wasn't at all

872
00:54:13,332 --> 00:54:16,096
Want a little bit, Edie?
No

873
00:54:16,202 --> 00:54:18,762
You don't want a little bit?
[David Mutters]

874
00:54:18,871 --> 00:54:21,499
My God!
What?

875
00:54:21,607 --> 00:54:24,098
I just thought of something
What?

876
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:28,112
Give me that What did you think of?
What? Come on

877
00:54:28,214 --> 00:54:30,409
[Whispering]
The guy was standing outside the window

878
00:54:30,516 --> 00:54:32,916
and he was passing books out to him

879
00:54:33,018 --> 00:54:35,077
You think so, Edie?
Yes

880
00:54:35,187 --> 00:54:37,348
I don't believe all that
Yes!

881
00:54:37,456 --> 00:54:41,119
I don't believe it
Want a taste, Edie?

882
00:54:41,227 --> 00:54:44,822
I don't want any
No We lost the glasses The glasses are gone

883
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:48,832
Next thing, those antiques
will all be missing

884
00:54:48,934 --> 00:54:52,461
See, you shouldn't have
a contact with the outside world

885
00:54:52,571 --> 00:54:56,905
because how do I know that
there isn't something up in that room?

886
00:54:57,009 --> 00:54:59,500
If you get what I mean

887
00:54:59,612 --> 00:55:02,581
You can't tell what's
been put up in that room

888
00:55:02,681 --> 00:55:05,741
or what's been taken out

889
00:55:05,851 --> 00:55:08,843
[Sighs]
Don't worry so much, please

890
00:55:10,456 --> 00:55:13,653
This cat's going to the bathroom
right in back of my portrait

891
00:55:13,759 --> 00:55:17,354
Oh, isn't that awful?
No, I'm glad he is

892
00:55:17,463 --> 00:55:20,398
I'm glad somebody's doing
something they want to do

893
00:55:20,499 --> 00:55:23,229
[David Laughing]

894
00:55:44,823 --> 00:55:47,951
I was frozen this morning
when I woke up Were you, Edie?

895
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:51,655
I did drop It dropped It dropped quite a bit
I missed you last night

896
00:55:51,764 --> 00:55:56,861
I was so lonely She only left me
one little kitty to keep me warm

897
00:55:56,969 --> 00:56:01,429
And all these blankets were on the
floors, all this pile of stuff here

898
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:03,599
Jerry's pretty good at waiting on me

899
00:56:03,709 --> 00:56:06,974
He can find things here that
I wouldn't find for half an hour

900
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:10,742
Jerry, the majordomo
I'm so sick of that kid

901
00:56:10,849 --> 00:56:14,285
I have great pity for him
Lois says... Well, you know the trouble

902
00:56:14,386 --> 00:56:16,854
And I like him, but...
Lois says... You know the trouble

903
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:20,323
What?
The trouble is, he's madly in love with Edie

904
00:56:20,426 --> 00:56:23,953
I said I thought Edie was madly
in love with him Pardon me

905
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:27,692
He might as well leave right now,
'cause he's never gonna get it

906
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,268
So that's it
Get what? Sex with you?

907
00:56:30,369 --> 00:56:33,304
What he's after
He doesn't want any sex with you

908
00:56:33,405 --> 00:56:36,738
Well, that's all they're after
An old person like you? Good God!

909
00:56:36,842 --> 00:56:40,141
So why don't you tell him right now?
Unheard of Unheard of

910
00:56:40,245 --> 00:56:43,146
You should tell him right now
so I'm not bothered by him

911
00:56:43,248 --> 00:56:45,978
He's got about six girls
in East Hampton He's so busy

912
00:56:46,085 --> 00:56:48,417
No, but the point is, he thinks...
I don't know what he's doing

913
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:51,148
He's out every single night
with a different girl

914
00:56:51,256 --> 00:56:54,191
Yeah, but that's, that's the point, you see
He had a wonderful time

915
00:56:54,293 --> 00:56:58,354
He's gonna be here for years and years
I see this coming

916
00:56:58,464 --> 00:57:02,332
I hope
The guy's gonna be here for years and years

917
00:57:03,802 --> 00:57:06,896
I doubt that
It's gonna be one of those things

918
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:09,634
Like Tom Logan

919
00:57:09,742 --> 00:57:13,337
Aren't you gonna feed Whiskers, Edie?

920
00:57:13,445 --> 00:57:16,107
Come on, go in and feed Whiskers

921
00:57:16,215 --> 00:57:20,174
Now, don't eat it
Give it to Whiskers, please

922
00:57:20,285 --> 00:57:23,448
You're thin You want to get thin
She's very mean to me

923
00:57:23,555 --> 00:57:29,187
No I have to be very strict
The priest said she needed a very strict hand

924
00:57:29,294 --> 00:57:32,263
[Laughs]
What the priest told me

925
00:57:32,364 --> 00:57:36,664
[Imitating Irish Accent] "She sure needs
a very strong hand, your daughter"

926
00:57:38,404 --> 00:57:40,872
And I tried to give it to her,
you know that?

927
00:57:40,973 --> 00:57:44,841
After Mr. Beale, you know,
stopped living in East Hampton

928
00:57:44,943 --> 00:57:48,606
I had a terrible
hard time with Edie

929
00:57:48,714 --> 00:57:54,050
She just went wild after
her father wasn't living here

930
00:57:54,153 --> 00:57:57,714
She went wild, absolutely wild

931
00:57:57,823 --> 00:58:00,257
I couldn't do anything
with her at all

932
00:58:00,492 --> 00:58:03,017
Isn't it awful
when a dancer gets fat?

933
00:58:03,128 --> 00:58:05,858
Isn't it awful? God

934
00:58:05,964 --> 00:58:10,867
It's awful, I'm telling you
It's awful! God!

935
00:58:14,973 --> 00:58:17,908
My father believed in running
the children's lives, you know?

936
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:21,878
He wanted me to get my master's degree,
be a junior partner in his law firm

937
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:24,744
Take the ice cream
He was 165 Broadway

938
00:58:24,850 --> 00:58:27,751
on the ninth floor,
and my knees would start to shake

939
00:58:27,853 --> 00:58:30,981
coming down on the ninth floor
of Mr. Beale's office

940
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:34,548
My knees were rattling
My mouth was dry

941
00:58:35,894 --> 00:58:37,794
You were scared of your father

942
00:58:37,896 --> 00:58:41,798
And I'd go in, and he'd come forward out
of his office with his watch in his hand

943
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:44,801
and then he'd look at the clock
on the wall, and he'd say

944
00:58:44,903 --> 00:58:48,600
"You're five minutes late,"
he'd say Oh, my God

945
00:58:48,707 --> 00:58:51,938
No, he had a very...
And then he'd sit down and look at me like this

946
00:58:52,044 --> 00:58:54,672
and say, "Take it off
Take that hat off

947
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:57,544
"Take that lipstick off
Take that nail polish off

948
00:58:57,649 --> 00:59:01,312
How dare you wear those high heels!"
Oh, she's just acting

949
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:05,220
Don't you want some of this?
Butter pecan

950
00:59:05,324 --> 00:59:08,191
Mmm Mmm

951
00:59:08,293 --> 00:59:11,353
He said the only thing
to be was a professional woman

952
00:59:11,463 --> 00:59:15,422
He did say that
Didn't he, Mother?

953
00:59:15,534 --> 00:59:17,832
Well, I wouldn't say
it's the only thing

954
00:59:17,936 --> 00:59:20,803
He didn't want me to get married

955
00:59:20,906 --> 00:59:24,501
I don't think people should get married
I don't believe in it at all

956
00:59:24,610 --> 00:59:28,205
If you can't get a man to propose
to you, you might as well be dead

957
00:59:28,313 --> 00:59:30,838
Oh, I don't think it's important
I think it's disgusting

958
00:59:30,949 --> 00:59:33,577
Aunt Mary had the most wonderful life
absolutely disgusting

959
00:59:33,685 --> 00:59:36,210
Lived to be 94 years of age
to live alone

960
00:59:36,321 --> 00:59:39,882
What are they proving? They have to around
with dogs or other women or something

961
00:59:39,992 --> 00:59:42,426
Dogs are lovely
I, I think it's terrible

962
00:59:42,528 --> 00:59:47,522
I'll take a dog any day
[Chuckles]

963
00:59:47,633 --> 00:59:52,696
Why didn't you marry the man
you wanted to, like I did?

964
00:59:52,804 --> 00:59:56,865
I think the saddest thing was my not
marrying into the Obelensky family

965
00:59:56,975 --> 00:59:59,705
'cause I adore them

966
00:59:59,811 --> 01:00:03,212
Any Obelensky is wonderful That's all I can say
He's a very sweet man

967
01:00:03,315 --> 01:00:06,011
If he's related to
the Obelenskys, he's okay

968
01:00:06,118 --> 01:00:08,348
I didn't know he was any relation to them
Yes

969
01:00:08,453 --> 01:00:11,786
I never knew it
Serge's, uh, nephew by his half-sister

970
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:14,188
Now, there was a boy
I might have married

971
01:00:14,293 --> 01:00:16,284
Why didn't you marry Paul Getty?

972
01:00:16,395 --> 01:00:18,363
I said, "How did you
happen to come here?"

973
01:00:18,463 --> 01:00:21,330
And he said, "Oh, I saw you at a dance,"
he said, "in South Hampton"

974
01:00:21,433 --> 01:00:23,993
I said, "You did?" He said, "Yes"
He was just a kid

975
01:00:24,102 --> 01:00:27,299
He was 32 And I said,
"Eugene, what you need is a girl"

976
01:00:27,406 --> 01:00:30,807
And he said, "No, Edith, I'm looking
for a wife I wanna get married"

977
01:00:30,909 --> 01:00:34,902
He wanted to take Edie to Westchester
Wasn't that cute?

978
01:00:35,013 --> 01:00:39,040
Tom had just died, and I did not
want another man in my kitchen

979
01:00:39,151 --> 01:00:42,746
I went downstairs...
He'd just made a cookbook

980
01:00:42,854 --> 01:00:46,153
Mother got rid of him in 15 minutes
Don't want any cookbooks

981
01:00:46,258 --> 01:00:49,887
Mother got rid of him in 15 minutes
because he came from a celebrated family

982
01:00:49,995 --> 01:00:54,898
The Tyszkiewicz family And I suppose mother
didn't want me to have anybody that was decent

983
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,093
You understand
I didn't want anybody in the kitchen

984
01:00:57,202 --> 01:01:00,660
It would have been perfectly
all right for me to marry Tom Logan

985
01:01:00,772 --> 01:01:02,706
Why did you want to marry a kid 32?

986
01:01:02,808 --> 01:01:06,300
I forgot to say that Eugene was a count
He didn't have a nickel

987
01:01:06,411 --> 01:01:09,505
I would have been Countess...
Countess Edith

988
01:01:09,615 --> 01:01:14,075
I didn't want my child to be taken away
I'd be entirely alone

989
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:22,226
Do you know what I go through
with this awful stuff?

990
01:01:22,327 --> 01:01:25,694
Listen, I've got to eat lunch
I'm starving

991
01:01:25,797 --> 01:01:28,027
Well, you know me... always hungry

992
01:01:28,133 --> 01:01:30,795
[Door Closes]
I'm not gonna gain the weight back

993
01:01:30,902 --> 01:01:33,871
I didn't have any breakfast

994
01:01:33,972 --> 01:01:36,964
I'll put some lipstick on
You want to give me something to put on, Edie?

995
01:01:37,075 --> 01:01:39,509
[Giggles]
I'm beginning to laugh

996
01:01:41,813 --> 01:01:44,873
These are my brother's drawers
Give me something to put on

997
01:01:44,983 --> 01:01:50,580
And I feel so strongly about mementos
and everything because of Mother

998
01:01:50,689 --> 01:01:55,058
that I was never able to ever clean out
these desk drawers and throw the stuff away

999
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:59,961
Would you believe that?
You know, it's childhood stuff

1000
01:02:00,065 --> 01:02:04,297
Oh, Edie, yoo-hoo!
"Memorabalia" or something

1001
01:02:04,403 --> 01:02:07,304
Edie, yoo-hoo!
I couldn't throw anything away

1002
01:02:07,406 --> 01:02:10,034
They're looking at this room
Oh, Edie!

1003
01:02:10,142 --> 01:02:12,110
Yeah, just a minute

1004
01:02:12,210 --> 01:02:14,804
They discovered something
terrific in here

1005
01:02:14,913 --> 01:02:17,905
Come on I've waited long enough
Is it from Austria?

1006
01:02:18,016 --> 01:02:21,713
Why, what happened?
Never mind about me

1007
01:02:24,089 --> 01:02:28,389
"The moving finger writes
and, having writ, moves on"

1008
01:02:28,493 --> 01:02:31,690
I was going to write
another line from Omar Khayyam:

1009
01:02:31,797 --> 01:02:35,233
"We come like water
and we go like wind"

1010
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:37,825
Edie, yoo-hoo!

1011
01:02:37,936 --> 01:02:40,700
Well, I got that one up
Edie, bring me the telephone

1012
01:02:40,806 --> 01:02:44,264
That's the man
This is the woman

1013
01:02:44,376 --> 01:02:47,641
I can't tell
Are you getting me the blue kimono, Edie?

1014
01:02:47,746 --> 01:02:51,614
I'm putting up the silver masks

1015
01:02:51,717 --> 01:02:53,617
Edie, come here a minute Hurry

1016
01:02:53,719 --> 01:02:56,313
I can't get the thumbtack
in the wall

1017
01:02:56,421 --> 01:02:59,879
I think I have the saddest life
Oh, Edie!

1018
01:02:59,991 --> 01:03:03,449
I have to go on with
the redecoration of this room

1019
01:03:03,562 --> 01:03:06,190
Yeah
Can you get me something to eat?

1020
01:03:06,298 --> 01:03:08,198
All right

1021
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,808
[Edie]
I made this

1022
01:03:16,908 --> 01:03:21,504
Those are roses
of all different years

1023
01:03:21,613 --> 01:03:26,641
That's my shell collection
You can't see it, it's so dirty Isn't that tragic?

1024
01:03:26,752 --> 01:03:30,620
That's... These...
Then I have two things to go there

1025
01:03:30,722 --> 01:03:33,122
And "Around the World"
is supposed to go there

1026
01:03:33,225 --> 01:03:35,125
Edie, I can't do it

1027
01:03:38,697 --> 01:03:42,463
Open it I can't do it
I'm just gonna put that up there

1028
01:03:42,567 --> 01:03:45,263
'cause I like red
in this room for some reason

1029
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:49,568
And I was gonna hang
the birdcage right here

1030
01:03:49,674 --> 01:03:52,370
and have "Around the World" there

1031
01:03:52,477 --> 01:03:54,911
But I haven't gotten to that

1032
01:03:56,915 --> 01:04:00,612
Perhaps I'd better begin taking care of
Mother and bossing her and cooking her some food

1033
01:04:00,719 --> 01:04:03,051
What do you boys think?
Bossing her around?

1034
01:04:03,155 --> 01:04:05,783
Yeah
I let her do what she wants

1035
01:04:05,891 --> 01:04:09,987
I think maybe I ought to give her
cooked meals at certain hours

1036
01:04:10,095 --> 01:04:13,826
What do you think?
I don't have any clock

1037
01:04:13,932 --> 01:04:16,696
You know,
I never know what time it is

1038
01:04:19,237 --> 01:04:21,296
You think she'd eat them?

1039
01:04:21,406 --> 01:04:24,068
I don't know You know her
better than anybody

1040
01:04:24,176 --> 01:04:27,907
I give her her head I let her do what
she wants to do I think it's awful

1041
01:04:29,981 --> 01:04:35,317
She should eat, you know, chopped meat and
a baked potato at a certain hour for luncheon

1042
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:38,116
Then have a nice little dinner

1043
01:04:38,223 --> 01:04:40,123
But that takes timing

1044
01:05:24,102 --> 01:05:27,003
No, I'm not ready,
and I have no makeup on!

1045
01:05:27,105 --> 01:05:30,268
[Albert Laughing]
But things are getting better!

1046
01:05:30,375 --> 01:05:33,071
Did you find my sign, "In bathtub"?

1047
01:05:33,178 --> 01:05:35,442
Right
I couldn't believe it

1048
01:05:35,547 --> 01:05:37,640
Come on in
We're not ready

1049
01:05:37,749 --> 01:05:42,015
Is that Al down there? Hello, Al
[Albert] Yeah Hi

1050
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:44,384
Take your time
Oh, God! I almost tripped

1051
01:05:44,489 --> 01:05:48,823
I almost broke my neck then
God, these stairs are dirty

1052
01:05:48,927 --> 01:05:51,691
Oh
[Giggles]

1053
01:05:51,796 --> 01:05:54,026
[Indistinct Chattering]

1054
01:05:54,132 --> 01:05:56,896
How could Edie leave
these stairs like this?

1055
01:05:58,603 --> 01:06:01,970
Don't I look funny
coming down these stairs, hmm?

1056
01:06:02,073 --> 01:06:05,440
No You look great
Don't I? I feel funny

1057
01:06:05,544 --> 01:06:08,377
I feel funny

1058
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,414
Just like a night at the opera
Is it?

1059
01:06:10,515 --> 01:06:13,643
The night at the opera will be when
I get in that chair in the dining room

1060
01:06:13,752 --> 01:06:15,811
That would be the night
at the opera

1061
01:06:15,921 --> 01:06:19,584
Mother, Lois and Jack are here!
Hello, jack

1062
01:06:19,691 --> 01:06:22,216
[Lois] Happy birthday!
[Chatters, Indistinct]

1063
01:06:22,327 --> 01:06:25,990
I say, where's the cushion, Edie?
Get the cushion I'll ruin my dress

1064
01:06:26,097 --> 01:06:29,931
Oh, yes She puts it here
Oh, God, and those chairs

1065
01:06:30,035 --> 01:06:33,061
Are they dirty, those chairs
Hello, jack

1066
01:06:33,171 --> 01:06:35,537
Hi, how are you? Happy birthday
[Mrs. Beale Giggles]

1067
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:37,540
Well, you're very cute
to celebrate with me today

1068
01:06:37,642 --> 01:06:41,510
I like you in that costume, Lois
Oh, why, thank you

1069
01:06:41,613 --> 01:06:43,945
[Edith] I see Edie hasn't...
You better not sit on those chairs

1070
01:06:44,049 --> 01:06:47,917
They look very dirty
They can sit on paper

1071
01:06:48,019 --> 01:06:50,010
I thought you were gonna
clean up, Edie

1072
01:06:50,121 --> 01:06:53,284
I tried
I swept the, uh, hall

1073
01:06:53,391 --> 01:06:56,758
Well, I'm kind of disapp...Jack,
you don't mind sitting by me, do you?

1074
01:06:56,861 --> 01:07:00,797
I swept the floor We have wine
I'll bring down the glasses

1075
01:07:00,899 --> 01:07:03,561
Bring down the wine, please

1076
01:07:03,668 --> 01:07:07,536
And Edie is due... Lois is due ginger ale
Okay

1077
01:07:07,639 --> 01:07:10,301
But don't let the cats out

1078
01:07:10,408 --> 01:07:12,376
How do you like that thing
Lois did for me, jack?

1079
01:07:12,477 --> 01:07:14,536
Are your eyes good enough
to see that?

1080
01:07:14,646 --> 01:07:17,547
Oh, sure
How are your eyes?

1081
01:07:17,649 --> 01:07:19,549
[Edie Giggling]

1082
01:07:19,651 --> 01:07:22,711
She's no waitress, I'll tell ya
[Giggling Continues]

1083
01:07:22,821 --> 01:07:25,119
Well, she's got a pretty heavy tray

1084
01:07:25,223 --> 01:07:29,387
Leave the tray here, won't you?
Oh, no, she's not gonna

1085
01:07:29,494 --> 01:07:31,428
She's gonna do
just as she wants, you know

1086
01:07:31,529 --> 01:07:35,556
She's a Schrafft's waitress
They always do just as they want

1087
01:07:35,667 --> 01:07:38,295
Here's to Mother
May she live to be at least 80

1088
01:07:38,403 --> 01:07:41,998
Oh, it's one more year Ha, ha
She's in her 79th

1089
01:07:42,107 --> 01:07:44,803
She's in her 79th now... 79th year
[Radio Announcer, Indistinct]

1090
01:07:44,909 --> 01:07:48,003
She's gonna tell that to everybody
in East Hampton, you know

1091
01:07:48,113 --> 01:07:50,946
[Jack] Well, that's life
Everybody's gonna know my age

1092
01:07:51,049 --> 01:07:54,143
Well, happy birthday

(music) To you (music)

1100
01:08:16,541 --> 01:08:18,907
Why do we have to have
paper cups when I wanted my...

1101
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:24,539
I wanted my green goblets with all the gold
on 'em, and she wouldn't bring 'em down

1102
01:08:24,649 --> 01:08:28,983
[Radio: Commercial]
So disappointed on my birthday

1103
01:08:29,087 --> 01:08:31,612
(music) Sugar-free Diet Pepsi is here (music)

1104
01:08:33,458 --> 01:08:36,950
Oh, what a beautiful...
I knew I wanted to look at that cake!

1105
01:08:37,062 --> 01:08:38,962
Did you ever see anything
like that?

1106
01:08:39,064 --> 01:08:42,500
"Happy Birthday" Gorgeous!
[Phone Ringing]

1107
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:46,730
Imagine having red... Somebody's calling me, Edie
That's terrific

1108
01:08:46,838 --> 01:08:50,968
My sister ordered that out of Sag Harbor
Hello? Yeah

1109
01:08:51,076 --> 01:08:54,375
Hey, Mother, can you move your chair a little bit?
Yeah

1110
01:08:54,479 --> 01:09:00,042
This is the first time we've used
the long wire in the dining room

1111
01:09:00,151 --> 01:09:02,051
Oh, hello, Polly

1112
01:09:04,155 --> 01:09:07,613
Thank you, dear Are you gonna sing it
all the way through?

1113
01:09:07,726 --> 01:09:11,355
[Giggles] Listen,
I got your beautiful present

1114
01:09:11,463 --> 01:09:15,058
Uh, Edie, have you brought the present down yet?
I haven't opened any presents

1115
01:09:15,166 --> 01:09:19,193
We're sitting down here
in the so-called old...

1116
01:09:19,304 --> 01:09:23,138
What, dear?
We haven't opened anything

1117
01:09:23,241 --> 01:09:25,903
There's a great big box up there

1118
01:09:26,010 --> 01:09:28,308
Tremendous box, but we haven't
opened the presents

1119
01:09:28,413 --> 01:09:31,041
Well, you sent me a card
I got that

1120
01:09:31,149 --> 01:09:33,583
I don't think she did
send Mother a card

1121
01:09:33,685 --> 01:09:35,915
Michele sent the cards

1122
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:39,183
I haven't started the cake,
but I'll read you what it says

1123
01:09:39,290 --> 01:09:41,258
It says, uh...
What does it say, Jack?

1124
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:45,659
Edith, happy birthday...
Oh, it says, "Happy birthday, Edith"

1125
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:48,528
And that's all in red
[Jack] Yes

1126
01:09:48,633 --> 01:09:50,624
And then the flowers
underneath are...

1127
01:09:50,735 --> 01:09:52,930
Well, yellow flowers and green

1128
01:09:53,037 --> 01:09:55,733
It's a perfectly enormous cake

1129
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:58,900
Oh! [Laughs]

1130
01:09:59,010 --> 01:10:02,673
Thank you, dear Hang up

1131
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:07,275
Did you say good-bye? Did you say good-bye?
That's the girl you hated

1132
01:10:07,385 --> 01:10:09,785
[Jack] Are they having eye trouble?
They freeze your eyes

1133
01:10:09,888 --> 01:10:12,448
Both of them have been operated
They had to have operations

1134
01:10:12,557 --> 01:10:15,492
They both had two operations
And then they weren't good, either

1135
01:10:15,593 --> 01:10:17,493
One lost her eye One girl

1136
01:10:17,595 --> 01:10:20,325
Yeah, the eyes disappeared...
dried up and disappeared

1137
01:10:20,431 --> 01:10:24,060
She has double vision She has to wear
dark glasses over the cataract glasses

1138
01:10:24,169 --> 01:10:26,899
She's absolutely cured, Edie!

1139
01:10:27,005 --> 01:10:29,565
She's cured now
Did she say she was cured?

1140
01:10:29,674 --> 01:10:31,835
She said, "I feel wonderful"

1141
01:10:31,943 --> 01:10:34,912
The really nice thing to have
is to get deaf and get blind

1142
01:10:35,013 --> 01:10:38,847
and then have some cancer
come in your face and your lips

1143
01:10:38,950 --> 01:10:43,410
Cancer?
Cancer of the tongue or something like that

1144
01:10:43,521 --> 01:10:45,921
Yeah, cancer is worse

[Lois] A little pad there
you can write your requests on

1148
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:58,096
I need that more than anything
to write things down

1149
01:10:58,203 --> 01:11:02,333
I have my things written all over boxes,
all over the bed, everywhere

1150
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:05,136

1151
01:11:05,243 --> 01:11:07,404
I've got...
Who have I got there, Edie?

1152
01:11:07,512 --> 01:11:10,310

1153
01:11:10,415 --> 01:11:13,782
All of'em Isn't that a nice book, Edie? Look
Terrific

1154
01:11:13,885 --> 01:11:15,978
I can't be late now
and I can't forget

1155
01:11:16,087 --> 01:11:18,453
And I can't hate anybody
and I can't do anything

1156
01:11:18,556 --> 01:11:23,186
The little book is gonna keep me
straight Straight as a die

1157
01:11:23,294 --> 01:11:26,730
Isn't that nice? I haven't had
a little thing like that in ages

1158
01:11:26,831 --> 01:11:30,323
I had a wonderful time
Your hands are cold It did you no good, my food

1159
01:11:30,435 --> 01:11:33,131
Oh, no
Your hands are cold, lady

1160
01:11:33,238 --> 01:11:36,469

The cats are in with me

1168
01:12:00,865 --> 01:12:03,663
Will you turn the heat off?
It is terribly hot in here

1169
01:12:03,768 --> 01:12:06,396
Your room is terribly dirty
It's got to be cleaned

1170
01:12:06,504 --> 01:12:09,029
Not tonight, Geraldine
There's a horrible smell I can hardly sit here

1171
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:11,506
I love that smell I thrive on it
Makes me feel good

1172
01:12:11,609 --> 01:12:14,407
We have to hang the portrait
and clean the room

1173
01:12:14,512 --> 01:12:17,743
No! Pull the chair out!
He wants to look at it!

1174
01:12:17,849 --> 01:12:22,946
I'm not ashamed of anything Where
my body is is a very precious place

1175
01:12:23,054 --> 01:12:26,751
It's "concentrated" ground

What are they doing?
Take a picture of Edie

1178
01:12:31,696 --> 01:12:36,360
I'm trying to think of... Oh, I know
what I can have Oh, for goodness sakes, he is

1179
01:12:36,467 --> 01:12:41,234
My God They see me as... You know,
you don't see me as I see myself

1180
01:12:41,339 --> 01:12:45,036
But you're very good,
what you do see me as

1181
01:12:46,511 --> 01:12:48,411
I mean, it's okay

1182
01:12:51,349 --> 01:12:56,116
Are you pleased with those?
You know, I see myself as a little girl

1183
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:59,383
And all that
What I see is a very immature child

1184
01:12:59,490 --> 01:13:04,450
She sees me as a baby, and I see myself
as some kind of a little girl

1185
01:13:04,562 --> 01:13:07,531
They see me as a woman
I don't see that

1186
01:13:07,632 --> 01:13:09,896

that she has to wiggle
about 20 times to every note

you see, to distract the people,
you know, but she really can't sing it right

1270
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:33,680
Guess what's happened
What?

1271
01:19:33,784 --> 01:19:36,378
What I had felt was in the cards

1272
01:19:36,487 --> 01:19:40,753
I'm telling you, I'm not gonna spend
another ten years with this

1273
01:19:40,858 --> 01:19:43,053

Who is?
The Marble Faun

1277
01:19:53,771 --> 01:19:56,035
Oh
He just gave us a washing machine

1278
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:58,574
That cements the deal

1279
01:19:58,676 --> 01:20:01,236
I gotta get out of here I'm not
gonna spend the rest of my life

1280
01:20:01,345 --> 01:20:04,212
washing clothes in that goddamn...

1281
01:20:04,315 --> 01:20:07,478
I don't blame you
It's a very nice washing machine

1282
01:20:07,585 --> 01:20:10,383
It came from this house
they're gonna sell

1283
01:20:10,488 --> 01:20:14,822
You know, he had a job
as a gardener's assistant at this house

1284
01:20:14,925 --> 01:20:18,918
And they're gonna sell the house,
so they gave him the washing machine

1285
01:20:19,029 --> 01:20:21,793
[Whispering]
But he's moving in

1286
01:20:21,899 --> 01:20:23,799
Oh

1287
01:20:23,901 --> 01:20:25,801
I can't watch him, I'm telling you

1288
01:20:25,903 --> 01:20:29,532
Of course, he's still gonna have
the gardening job, you know

1289
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:32,700
But I think he gets home at 4:00

1290
01:20:32,810 --> 01:20:35,779
So, Mother says... Do you wanna
come in and speak to Mother?

1291
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:37,780
She'd like to speak to you
Okay

1292
01:20:37,882 --> 01:20:42,683
Come on in I'm pulverized
by this latest thing

1293
01:20:42,787 --> 01:20:46,484
Well, you do!
You have a beautiful face, like a girl

1294
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:48,558
Like, you look like my mother

1295
01:20:48,659 --> 01:20:52,026
The absolute image
of my mother, jerry

1296
01:20:52,129 --> 01:20:54,563
Jerry, you're not going
to drink anything, are you?

1297
01:20:54,665 --> 01:20:57,657
No
Well, what are you gonna have?

1298
01:20:57,768 --> 01:21:01,169
I'll wait for the chicken
You're waiting for the chicken?

1299
01:21:01,272 --> 01:21:04,298
You mean to say you're not
gonna have soup or a drink

1300
01:21:04,408 --> 01:21:07,707
or a highball
or something like that?

1301
01:21:07,812 --> 01:21:09,871
Don't you think
we better have some rum?

1302
01:21:12,116 --> 01:21:15,176
Oh, no She didn't put any papers
on that thing today?

1303
01:21:15,286 --> 01:21:20,656
I asked her to Jerry,
I'm badly treated all along

1304
01:21:20,758 --> 01:21:25,889
[Edie Whispering] I think my days
at Grey Gardens are limited

1305
01:21:25,996 --> 01:21:29,295

at Grey Gardens are limited

(music) When do we start (music)
Oh, God, please!

1307
01:21:37,975 --> 01:21:40,842
(music) The scene is set (music)
Oh, Edie, take that scarf off

1308
01:21:40,945 --> 01:21:45,177
(music) That I'm in love with you (music)
Grab that scarf for me

1309
01:21:45,282 --> 01:21:47,773
Oh, Edie, quit it, for God's sake

[Edie Giggling]

1311
01:21:52,623 --> 01:21:55,990
There's an extra knife
I'll put it in the middle

1312
01:21:56,093 --> 01:21:59,460
I forgot the forks
Do you mind getting my slippers,

1313
01:21:59,563 --> 01:22:03,522
Will you, please?
You know where you put them

1314
01:22:03,634 --> 01:22:06,034
You have to get very tough
with Edie

1315
01:22:06,136 --> 01:22:08,536
She won't do anything
till you get very, very tough

1316
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:12,700
A strong hand, says the priest
Said, "She needs a strong hand"

1317
01:22:12,810 --> 01:22:17,907
I said, "I know it I brought Edie up
without her father It was very difficult"

1318
01:22:18,015 --> 01:22:21,041
Then she went to New York
and did what she wanted to do

1319
01:22:21,151 --> 01:22:25,383
You know, I wanted to get Mr. Beale
back and have him come back

1320
01:22:25,489 --> 01:22:28,720
She said she'd leave the house forever
if I had her father come back

Would you bring my little radio?

1323
01:22:34,798 --> 01:22:37,926
Edie, will you bring my little radio?
It's on my bed

1324
01:22:38,035 --> 01:22:40,731
Will you bring
my little radio, please?

1325
01:22:40,838 --> 01:22:43,398
I've got to have
some professional music

1326

(music) [Edie Continues Singing]
She found the slippers

1327
01:22:47,144 --> 01:22:52,776
Quite remarkable
You got the radio, Edie?

Put this up there
Will you, Edie, please?

1331

Put that up there

Oh, Edie, I can't take it, Edie

I won't have any hot food or anything

01:26:37,608 --> 01:26:40,736
'Cause I can't stand them
Finally, I can't stand them

1389
01:26:40,844 --> 01:26:44,143
There's something lacking,
and it's music, isn't it?

1390
01:26:44,248 --> 01:26:46,876
I mean, in a man

1391
01:26:46,984 --> 01:26:50,317
Well, it is nice to have a man
who can play the piano for you

No, that isn't all She doesn't get it
You can practice

1393

Unless a man understands music, there's
no point in my even meeting him

'cause I never could figure out
what was wrong

01:26:58,562 --> 01:27:02,123
You know, with stockbrokers
and tennis players and...

1396
01:27:02,232 --> 01:27:06,601
I tell you who was a songwriter
and a dancer and a playwright and everything

1397
01:27:06,703 --> 01:27:10,764
Eugene Tyszkiewicz
But Mother got rid of him in 15 minutes

1398
01:27:10,874 --> 01:27:15,106
He didn't speak English well
He'd only been here seven years

1399
01:27:15,212 --> 01:27:18,204
He might've poisoned you
He was Serge Obelensky's nephew

1400
01:27:18,315 --> 01:27:21,341
You wanna marry a stranger?
I mean, he was a very, very decent guy

1401
01:27:21,451 --> 01:27:25,717
I looked up his horoscope
He was born November the 14th

1402
01:27:25,823 --> 01:27:29,691
I have to go in now
He was a very wonderful boy

1403
01:27:29,793 --> 01:27:33,058
Who was this?
Eugene Tyszkiewicz He was a twin

1404
01:27:33,163 --> 01:27:35,791
I couldn't stand having another cook in this house
That isn't the point

1405
01:27:35,899 --> 01:27:40,029
And he actually proposed,
under the window

1406
01:27:40,137 --> 01:27:44,130
He had no home He was living in a third-class hotel
Under the window

1407
01:27:44,241 --> 01:27:47,938
He didn't have a thing
He said, "Edith, if you want

1408
01:27:48,045 --> 01:27:50,479
Not one single nickel
And I think that was decent, don't you?

1409
01:27:50,581 --> 01:27:54,381
I don't see why
He probably wouldn't have, but just the same

1410
01:27:54,484 --> 01:27:58,284
Not one person had entered
Grey Gardens for many years

1411
01:27:58,388 --> 01:28:01,380
before Eugene Tyszkiewicz
came around

1412
01:28:01,491 --> 01:28:05,484
So I credit him
with all the nerve in the world

1413
01:28:05,596 --> 01:28:08,087
Why, no one would even speak to us

1414
01:28:08,198 --> 01:28:12,259
People who I had walked
to the Maidstone Club with for years

1415
01:28:12,369 --> 01:28:14,997
Don't believe a word of it
Admiring all the other people

1416
01:28:15,105 --> 01:28:18,939
Don't believe a word of it, kid Not a word
All the other people...

1417
01:28:19,042 --> 01:28:21,840
[Rambling]
If your father could hear you, he'd turn in his grave

1418
01:28:21,945 --> 01:28:23,845
He'd say, "My God, Edie!"

1419
01:28:23,947 --> 01:28:27,110
Well, anyway, I think
you were very cruel, Mother

1420
01:28:27,217 --> 01:28:29,777
Well, I don't think it's nice
He came from one of the best families in Poland

1421
01:28:29,887 --> 01:28:32,082
And he was related to the Obelenskys

1422
01:28:32,189 --> 01:28:36,489
And I think it's terrible that she wouldn't
give me a chance with Eugene Tyszkiewicz

1423
01:28:36,593 --> 01:28:40,996
That was absolutely cruel
to drive the only beau away!

1424
01:28:41,098 --> 01:28:45,034
Do you want to marry a man 32?
I don't care! That was the only one

1425
01:28:45,135 --> 01:28:48,298
besides these horrible people
that came around here!

1426
01:28:48,405 --> 01:28:52,068
Have you got your thing lighted for that?
Yeah, we're all lit

1427
01:28:52,175 --> 01:28:56,771
He was only 32 and from a very good family!
32, and she's 52!

1428
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:59,747
And she got rid of him
in 15 minutes flat!

1429
01:28:59,850 --> 01:29:04,753
No, he didn't He said...
I'm bored with all these awful people like Jerry!

1430
01:29:04,855 --> 01:29:08,222
And all those people!
That wasn't the truth No

1431
01:29:08,325 --> 01:29:10,759
Tell him the truth
That was not the truth

1432
01:29:10,861 --> 01:29:12,795
Uh, no, and that was not the truth

1433
01:29:12,896 --> 01:29:16,423
He said, "How could such a warm,
lovely person over the telephone

1434
01:29:16,533 --> 01:29:18,558
turn into anything so cold?"

1435
01:29:18,669 --> 01:29:20,569
That's what he said
right down on the porch

1436
01:29:20,671 --> 01:29:24,664
So I said, I said, "You'd better go home"
Never said good-bye or anything

1437
01:29:24,775 --> 01:29:30,236
"How could such a warm, lovely woman
over the telephone turn into something so cold?"

1438
01:29:30,347 --> 01:29:33,976
I thought that was just
a little too much

1439
01:29:44,895 --> 01:29:48,991
Uh, I'll tell you the whole thing
You might as well face it

1440
01:29:49,099 --> 01:29:52,466
It's my mother's house,
and she owns it

1441
01:29:52,569 --> 01:29:55,231
and she wanted the people
she wanted in it

1442
01:29:55,339 --> 01:29:59,241
and she didn't want
the people that I wanted in it

1443
01:29:59,343 --> 01:30:02,039
But God knows whom I wanted in it

1444
01:30:02,145 --> 01:30:07,708
I mean, besides Eugene, and Mother
wouldn't allow Eugene to stay even 15 minutes

1445
01:30:07,818 --> 01:30:11,879
But I had to spend ten years
with Tom Logan

1446
01:30:11,989 --> 01:30:15,083
And now we have Jerry
who is Mother's friend

1447
01:30:15,192 --> 01:30:17,820
So, you just can't do
anything about it

1448
01:30:17,928 --> 01:30:20,055
So I can see now
why girls get married

1449
01:30:20,163 --> 01:30:23,155
You know, they're forced into it

1450
01:30:23,266 --> 01:30:26,326
It's all a question
of who you want to stay with

1451
01:30:26,436 --> 01:30:31,601
Of course, I'm mad about animals, but
raccoons and cats become a little bit boring

1452
01:30:31,708 --> 01:30:34,472
I mean, for too long a time

1453
01:30:37,481 --> 01:30:39,381
[Laughs]

1454
01:30:42,419 --> 01:30:44,580
I don't know

1455
01:30:44,688 --> 01:30:47,657
I don't know
I better check on Mother and the cats

1456
01:30:49,359 --> 01:30:52,886
She's a lot of fun
I hope she doesn't die

1457
01:30:52,996 --> 01:30:56,523
I hate to spend the winter here,
though Oh, God

1458
01:30:56,633 --> 01:30:59,033
Another winter

1459
01:31:16,153 --> 01:31:19,645
[Whispering] Very depressing,
you know, when winter sets in here

1460
01:31:19,756 --> 01:31:23,089
You know, 'cause I don't like the
country, and I don't want to be here

1461
01:31:23,193 --> 01:31:25,184
Any little rat...

1462
01:31:25,295 --> 01:31:27,490
Any little rat's nest in New York

1463
01:31:27,597 --> 01:31:30,623
any little mouse hole,
any little rat hole

1464
01:31:30,734 --> 01:31:34,534
even on Tenth Avenue,
I would like better

1465
01:31:42,879 --> 01:31:44,972
(music) [Phonograph: Big Band]

1466
01:31:53,390 --> 01:31:58,794
(music) Beneath the moon and the sun (music)

1467
01:31:58,895 --> 01:32:03,264
(music) Too near or far (music)

1468
01:32:03,366 --> 01:32:07,928
(music) No matter, darling where you are (music)

1469
01:32:08,038 --> 01:32:11,439
(music) I think of you (music)

1470
01:32:11,541 --> 01:32:15,238
(music) Night and day (music)

1471
01:32:15,345 --> 01:32:19,748
(music) [Continues, Indistinct]

1472
01:32:27,958 --> 01:32:32,520
(music) Silence of my lonely room (music)

1473
01:32:32,629 --> 01:32:36,030
(music) I think of you (music)

1474
01:33:07,264 --> 01:33:09,562
(music) The magic (music)

1475
01:33:09,666 --> 01:33:13,796
(music) Of dreams come true (music)

1476
01:33:22,512 --> 01:33:24,912
(music) [Humming]
