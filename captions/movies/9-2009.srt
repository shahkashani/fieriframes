1
00:00:54,018 --> 00:00:58,145
<i>We had such potential,
such promise.</i>

2
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:03,760
<i>But we squandered our gifts,
our intelligence.</i>

3
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:09,030
<i>Our blind pursuit
of technology</i>

4
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:12,095
<i>only sped us
quicker to our doom.</i>

5
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,801
<i>Our world is ending.</i>

6
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:22,506
<i>But life must go on.</i>

7
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:28,350
Wait! I'm a friend.

8
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,865
Yes, I always hoped.

9
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:46,868
Aha!

10
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:49,343
So much thought.

11
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:55,379
The details... Carved wood.
Molded copper.

12
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:00,854
You can't speak.

13
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:09,391
Uh-huh.

14
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,832
Come with me.

15
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:25,611
Here.

16
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:26,880
Stop!

17
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:34,326
Somethings in this world
are better left where they lie.

18
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:38,497
But if you know
where to look,

19
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,125
these ruins are
full of riches.

20
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:45,266
Friend?
Wait, wait.

21
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,997
Friend?
Almost there.

22
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:49,969
Friend.

23
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:51,771
Friend.

24
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:54,571
Friend?
Friend.

25
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,821
What's this?

26
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:08,458
You found it!

27
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:12,627
He's...
He's always drawing this.

28
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,428
Are... Are we alone?

29
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,029
No, no.

30
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:27,973
Go.

31
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,484
Get in the can. Go on.

32
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:48,554
Here, kitty, kitty.

33
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,490
Why don't you finish
what you started, with me?

34
00:09:57,564 --> 00:10:00,499
It's all right, I'm not going
to hurt you.

35
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:03,864
You're safe now.

36
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,803
Where am I?

37
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:13,107
With us. I never expected
to see an other one.

38
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,774
There, that should hold.

39
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:18,943
If 2 were here, he would have
done a better job.

40
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:20,617
I wonder where
he's gone to.

41
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:22,119
I was with him.

42
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:25,056
2? Where? Out there?

43
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,253
What was he...
Keeping secrets from me, I see.

44
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:30,955
I was coming
to tell you.

45
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:33,032
What's this?

46
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,194
I... I found him
in the emptiness.

47
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:38,801
What were you
doing out there?

48
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:40,999
I...
You'll lead the beast straight back to us!

49
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,939
But...
How many times have I told you?

50
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:47,309
The beast. That's what took 2!
If we hurry, we can save him.

51
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,848
If the beast took him,
that's the end of it.

52
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,144
But he was still alive.

53
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:53,049
No! We have rules!

54
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,891
Our new guest
seems confused.

55
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:07,697
Perhaps I can help you
achieve some clarity.

56
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:31,918
It didn't kill him?

57
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:33,323
Quiet!

58
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:42,195
Hey.

59
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:46,702
Hold on.

60
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:32,546
When we woke in this world,
it was chaos.

61
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:38,115
Man and machine attacked each other
with fire and metal.

62
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:42,858
<i>Look out behind you!</i>

63
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,594
I found others.

64
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,141
There's a path ahead.

65
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:01,678
Follow me.

66
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:15,379
The gas killed everything.

67
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:21,786
I led us here
to sanctuary.

68
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:25,158
And here we waited
for the war to end.

69
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:28,827
Slowly the world
became silent.

70
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:33,396
The only thing that remains now
is the beast.

71
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:36,969
So we stay hidden.

72
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:40,740
And we wait for it,
too, to sleep.

73
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:44,750
But where did it come from?
Why is it hunting us?

74
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:46,877
Questions like
that are pointless.

75
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:50,821
We need to protect ourselves,
keep ourselves out of danger.

76
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,654
Too many of us have
already been lost.

77
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:57,320
But he isn't lost.

78
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:02,226
Why aren't you listening to me?
2 chose his own path!

79
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:06,434
I suggest you avoid
making the same mistake.

80
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:15,407
Go to the watchtower
and take our guest with you.

81
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:22,105
This was the first thing
we built together.

82
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,583
We can still go after him.

83
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,518
Us? But he could be
anywhere out there.

84
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:35,727
That's where it took him.
Out towards those three tall shapes.

85
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:41,265
Oh, no.
We can't, not there.

86
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,259
We have rules.

87
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:49,307
Why do you
listen to 1?

88
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:51,501
A group must have a leader.

89
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:53,546
But what if he's wrong?

90
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:57,840
Come with me.

91
00:16:58,485 --> 00:16:59,850
I can't do it alone.

92
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,878
I...

93
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:05,419
I... I can't.

94
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,487
But wouldn’t he
have come for you?

95
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,330
I...

96
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:27,140
Wait.

97
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:34,511
We're going to
need a map.

98
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:40,220
Actually, I don't mind
having one eye. It's easier for me.

99
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:44,195
Allows me to concentrate
on just one thing at a time, you know?

100
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:10,216
Why was he out here alone?

101
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:31,339
Where's this tunnel?

102
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:32,969
I don't know!

103
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:36,943
Wait!

104
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:49,558
We should go back!

105
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:53,797
We can't.

106
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:06,877
The beast.

107
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:12,209
It's too dark.

108
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:18,417
We can use that.

109
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,548
Wait.

110
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:07,670
2 would be impressed.

111
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:14,306
We'll find him.

112
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,720
You know,
you're just like him.

113
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:25,586
You forget to
remember to be scared.

114
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,274
Can I wait here?

115
00:20:51,184 --> 00:20:52,173
Oh.

116
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,759
Why would it
bring him here?

117
00:21:52,712 --> 00:21:53,804
Two!

118
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:58,208
Two!

119
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:11,629
I knew you would come.

120
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,633
I thought...

121
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:43,480
Seven!?
I don't believe it!

122
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:57,134
You've come back!

123
00:23:57,203 --> 00:24:01,503
I never left. You finally decided
to join the fight.

124
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,508
You dropped this.

125
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:11,039
Where've you been hiding?

126
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:14,553
Rusty, hacked-together,
shoddy pile of...

127
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:26,931
We did it. We did it.
Remarkable. I never thought...

128
00:24:48,254 --> 00:24:49,778
Wait!

129
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:52,881
What are you doing?
We don't know what it is!

130
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:09,465
Oh!
No! Two!

131
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:57,746
Whoa!
Jump!

132
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,444
Hurry! Quick!

133
00:27:16,902 --> 00:27:18,893
What are you waiting for?

134
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:22,832
Keep up! Come on!

135
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:47,629
I knew we shouldn’t have come!

136
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,793
Why? Why did you do that?

137
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:52,133
I didn't know! I'm sorry.

138
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:56,605
I'm sorry.

139
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:03,014
What were you thinking?

140
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:12,924
What is it going to do?

141
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:15,893
I know where we
can find answers.

142
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:28,991
Is this what it was like?

143
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:34,269
Keep up!

144
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,098
Oh! They've been here?

145
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:05,796
The whole time?

146
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:08,736
Twins.

147
00:30:09,775 --> 00:30:13,006
They've been hiding here.
Lost in the past.

148
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:14,875
Looking for answers.

149
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:18,848
Oh!

150
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:21,082
They're cataloging.

151
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,284
Whoa!

152
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:38,027
We need your help.
We awakened something.

153
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:41,834
No. I awakened something.
Something terrible.

154
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,649
That's it!

155
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:33,220
<i>Today, the Chancellor
presented the latest advancement</i>

156
00:31:33,294 --> 00:31:36,127
<i>of technological
wizardry to the public.</i>

157
00:31:36,197 --> 00:31:41,690
<i>Comrades, today dawns a new era.</i>

158
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:44,238
<i>Let us praise
this new technology.</i>

159
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:48,970
<i>Welcome to the age
of the Machine!</i>

160
00:31:48,971 --> 00:31:52,444
<i>It will create new machines
in its own image!</i>

161
00:31:52,445 --> 00:31:54,378
<i>Machines of peace</i>

162
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:57,110
<i>that will usher in
a glorious new era</i>

163
00:31:57,111 --> 00:32:01,913
<i>of wealth and prosperity
for the state!</i>

164
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:12,264
<i>Residents are advised to
pause for a public address.</i>

165
00:32:14,902 --> 00:32:18,770
<i>Science has turned its
sinister hands against us.</i>

166
00:32:20,307 --> 00:32:22,208
<i>People of our mighty state,</i>

167
00:32:23,277 --> 00:32:28,408
<i>join me in repelling
the iron fist of the Machine.</i>

168
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,424
<i>But the thing
that woke it,</i>

169
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:47,363
it was round and imprinted
with strange shapes.

170
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:54,239
The shapes corresponded.

171
00:32:54,973 --> 00:33:00,036
It fit perfectly into the Machine
as if it were made for it.

172
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,114
That's what 6
always draws!

173
00:33:04,183 --> 00:33:05,582
6?

174
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:07,744
2 collected his drawings.

175
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:10,649
He was always
studying them.

176
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:14,956
I have to see them.

177
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,995
<i>What? Go back to 1?</i>

178
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:22,127
So he can lock us away
while this nightmare awakens?

179
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:24,462
Never.

180
00:33:51,597 --> 00:33:55,590
Where did he put them?
Uh... They're here somewhere.

181
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:56,790
Uh...

182
00:33:57,236 --> 00:33:59,830
Here. Here. Here they are.

183
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:02,339
Right?

184
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:12,282
<i>You awakened what?</i>

185
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:15,320
You fools! I warned you!

186
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:16,911
He warned you.

187
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:20,049
Now you've put us all
in unimaginable peril.

188
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:24,186
And may I ask,
did you manage to save 2?

189
00:34:24,263 --> 00:34:25,560
Of course not!

190
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:27,326
By following
this witless folly,

191
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,594
you've endangered
everything we work for!

192
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:31,602
Why was 2 sent out
to begin with?

193
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,331
I sent him to scout.

194
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:34,667
That doesn't
make any sense.

195
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,674
You don't send
the oldest out to...

196
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:39,734
Look, we need to figure out
what's going on.

197
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:43,646
The source, the source...

198
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:48,547
Go back to the source.

199
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:53,247
This is it. This is what
awakened the Machine.

200
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:56,289
What do you know
about this?

201
00:34:58,063 --> 00:35:02,363
Ah, You can't be trusted.
I won't allow you to endanger us further.

202
00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:04,596
Subjugate them!

203
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:05,964
Sub... What?

204
00:35:06,038 --> 00:35:08,131
You illiterate cretin!

205
00:35:08,207 --> 00:35:10,072
Take their belongings!

206
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:15,473
Hey!

207
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:24,385
You're nothing
but a coward.

208
00:35:27,392 --> 00:35:29,519
How dare you challenge me!

209
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:32,860
I, who kept everyone
safe all these years.

210
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:36,423
Ever since you got here,
everything has been unraveling.

211
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:40,301
You're a curse, a fool,
guided by pointless queries!

212
00:35:40,372 --> 00:35:44,308
And you are a blind man
guided by fear!

213
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:52,847
Sometimes fear is
the appropriate response.

214
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:11,902
Whoa!

215
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:18,837
Quick!

216
00:36:23,081 --> 00:36:24,708
9!
Go!

217
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:40,362
Nine!
Keep going! I'll find a way down!

218
00:37:26,445 --> 00:37:27,434
Come on!

219
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,704
Let me try that again.

220
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,030
Oh!

221
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:34,841
The cable! Cut it!

222
00:38:49,294 --> 00:38:50,625
Grab on!

223
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,106
Grab those wires!

224
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:21,148
Your cape!

225
00:39:21,927 --> 00:39:23,724
Let it go!
I can't!

226
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:26,428
Do it now!

227
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:45,739
Well, you owe me a cape.

228
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:10,897
Oh.

229
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:45,702
There will be more,
won't there?

230
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,672
It's not safe here.

231
00:41:52,277 --> 00:41:53,904
Stand lookout.

232
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,584
I'll search out
a safer retreat.

233
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:27,033
Oh!

234
00:42:30,515 --> 00:42:31,504
Ah!

235
00:42:33,084 --> 00:42:34,073
Ooh!

236
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:42,215
Oh!

237
00:43:13,692 --> 00:43:14,681
Oh.

238
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:21,021
What? What is it?

239
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:22,464
The source.

240
00:43:22,534 --> 00:43:24,559
The thing that
woke the Machine.

241
00:43:24,636 --> 00:43:27,867
Go back. Go back.
Back to where?

242
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:30,139
<i>Dark science.</i>

243
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:34,142
What good does this
useless rubbish do us? Forget it!

244
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:36,043
You know something.

245
00:43:36,848 --> 00:43:37,940
What do you know?

246
00:43:38,016 --> 00:43:41,076
I know enough to leave
their ancient evils to molder.

247
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:44,610
Look what they've left us with.
Leave it be, I say!

248
00:43:44,689 --> 00:43:47,920
But you,
always asking questions!

249
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:49,687
So many pointless questions!

250
00:43:49,761 --> 00:43:55,222
Probing. Pushing. Like 2!
He always had to know too much!

251
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,928
I was right! You did send him
out to die!

252
00:43:58,002 --> 00:43:59,867
He was old. He was weak!

253
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:05,639
Sometimes one must be sacrificed
for the good of many.

254
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:07,575
You coward!

255
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:11,945
Seven!

256
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:29,356
Your path takes us
to catastrophe.

257
00:44:37,075 --> 00:44:38,565
We have to go back.

258
00:44:38,643 --> 00:44:40,372
Back? Where?

259
00:44:40,445 --> 00:44:43,414
To the first room
where I woke.

260
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,209
Hmm?

261
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:42,503
Can't he see his way
only brings trouble?

262
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,006
I mean, what good
comes from his path?

263
00:45:48,213 --> 00:45:50,909
I know what we need.
I... I know what's right.

264
00:45:54,686 --> 00:45:55,846
No.

265
00:46:15,874 --> 00:46:18,104
No, no. It can't be!

266
00:46:19,244 --> 00:46:20,575
No! No!

267
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:25,442
No!

268
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:28,616
Find her!

269
00:47:10,695 --> 00:47:12,663
Don't look in the eyes!

270
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:25,032
Five!

271
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:49,962
Seven!
Nine!

272
00:47:58,543 --> 00:47:59,908
No!

273
00:48:12,724 --> 00:48:13,986
We have to go after them!

274
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:17,789
What? 8? Where's...
Where's 8?

275
00:48:17,862 --> 00:48:21,662
That thing has them! It's taking them
back to the Machine!

276
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,263
Then it's too late.

277
00:48:24,802 --> 00:48:26,793
We... We have to
get out of here.

278
00:48:26,938 --> 00:48:28,929
We must try to find
another safe place.

279
00:48:29,007 --> 00:48:32,875
No more hiding. We're going
after them! All of us.

280
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:38,305
Need I remind you of the outcome
of your last heroic venture?

281
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:54,697
I can't let this
happen to them.

282
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:21,375
I'm going in.

283
00:50:21,953 --> 00:50:23,318
I'm coming with you.

284
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:26,083
No. I need you here.

285
00:50:27,592 --> 00:50:31,494
If I don't make it back,
destroy it.

286
00:50:37,101 --> 00:50:39,296
Wait! How?

287
00:50:50,915 --> 00:50:56,012
So then, let's hear it.
What's your brilliant scheme?

288
00:50:58,256 --> 00:50:59,951
We’ll need a full barrel.

289
00:52:07,758 --> 00:52:10,318
Hey! Over here!

290
00:52:58,409 --> 00:52:59,876
Where are they?

291
00:52:59,944 --> 00:53:03,311
It's been too long.
We have to do it now.

292
00:53:03,381 --> 00:53:05,440
No! They need more time.

293
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:12,421
Help me pull it down!

294
00:53:41,886 --> 00:53:43,911
They're coming!
They're coming!

295
00:53:43,988 --> 00:53:46,479
Help! Help!

296
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,458
No! Not yet!

297
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:54,621
Let go, you fool!

298
00:53:55,066 --> 00:53:56,260
Five!

299
00:53:57,168 --> 00:53:58,726
We're coming!

300
00:53:59,103 --> 00:54:00,365
Now!

301
00:55:24,855 --> 00:55:26,447
Good riddance.

302
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:29,357
It's done.

303
00:56:13,838 --> 00:56:15,396
Sound.

304
00:56:17,675 --> 00:56:20,576
Sound.

305
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:24,172
Sound.

306
00:56:24,248 --> 00:56:25,579
Thank you.

307
00:56:44,368 --> 00:56:45,494
Hmm.

308
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:34,682
The Machine!
Everybody, the Machine!

309
00:57:34,752 --> 00:57:36,083
Run away!

310
00:57:40,758 --> 00:57:42,453
No! No!

311
00:57:44,395 --> 00:57:46,329
There's nothing we can do!

312
00:57:55,306 --> 00:57:57,365
No! No! No!

313
00:57:58,442 --> 00:57:59,704
No!

314
00:58:10,621 --> 00:58:13,146
They... They've
been trapped!

315
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:18,785
To the bridge!

316
00:58:27,771 --> 00:58:30,934
No! They're trapped!
They're trapped inside!

317
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:32,703
Six, come on!

318
00:58:32,776 --> 00:58:34,641
Get off the bridge!

319
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:55,888
No! Stop!
You mustn't destroy it!

320
00:58:55,966 --> 00:58:56,990
Get away, Six!

321
00:58:57,067 --> 00:58:59,365
You mustn't destroy it!
Don't destroy it!

322
00:58:59,436 --> 00:59:00,733
They're trapped!
They're trapped!

323
00:59:00,804 --> 00:59:03,034
They're inside!
They're inside!

324
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:18,218
Run!

325
00:59:20,324 --> 00:59:21,484
Jump!

326
00:59:23,694 --> 00:59:29,633
Go back to the first room!
He'll show you the source.

327
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:51,281
It must be destroyed.

328
00:59:51,355 --> 00:59:54,756
No. No, we can't!
Didn't you hear him?

329
00:59:54,825 --> 00:59:58,056
They're trapped inside.
We can still save them.

330
00:59:58,128 --> 00:59:59,925
What? How?

331
00:59:59,997 --> 01:00:03,228
We have to find the source.
It holds the answer.

332
01:00:05,502 --> 01:00:06,799
We need to destroy it.

333
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:09,065
But there's still a chance!

334
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:14,739
We're out of time.

335
01:00:16,447 --> 01:00:18,813
Nine, they're gone.

336
01:00:21,251 --> 01:00:22,718
You're wrong.

337
01:00:24,021 --> 01:00:25,318
Nine...

338
01:00:26,223 --> 01:00:27,656
Let him go.

339
01:01:31,522 --> 01:01:33,387
<i>Greetings, Nine.</i>

340
01:01:34,158 --> 01:01:37,787
<i>It had such promise,
my Great Machine.</i>

341
01:01:38,328 --> 01:01:41,354
<i>It was meant to be
an instrument of progress,</i>

342
01:01:42,366 --> 01:01:43,799
<i>of creation.</i>

343
01:01:44,768 --> 01:01:48,727
<i>That was the agreement
our Chancellor failed to honor.</i>

344
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:53,643
<i>Though the fault is
hardly his alone to bear.</i>

345
01:01:54,678 --> 01:01:58,478
<i>The Machine was born
purely of my intellect,</i>

346
01:01:59,683 --> 01:02:03,449
<i>which I now know
was not enough.</i>

347
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:10,152
<i>My creation was hopelessly flawed
and indeed dangerous,</i>

348
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:13,458
<i>for it lacked the human soul</i>

349
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:17,933
<i>and could be easily corrupted
by those who controlled it.</i>

350
01:02:18,001 --> 01:02:21,562
<i>That is why I'm
making each of you.</i>

351
01:02:21,638 --> 01:02:24,334
<i>You are all that's
left of humanity.</i>

352
01:02:25,209 --> 01:02:29,578
<i>You are all
the pieces of my soul.</i>

353
01:02:32,049 --> 01:02:36,850
<i>Together, you and this device
shall protect the future.</i>

354
01:02:38,322 --> 01:02:42,986
<i>Look closely and
remember what you see.</i>

355
01:04:14,051 --> 01:04:15,211
Fire!

356
01:04:27,097 --> 01:04:29,429
Quickly!
<i>I now know the truth!</i>

357
01:04:30,801 --> 01:04:32,428
The Scientist!

358
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:35,932
It's the Scientist.
He's the source!

359
01:04:36,974 --> 01:04:38,839
He gave us his soul.

360
01:04:39,843 --> 01:04:41,310
We are him.

361
01:04:47,718 --> 01:04:49,242
Load the cannon!

362
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:51,947
Stop! You’ll destroy
the talisman!

363
01:04:54,358 --> 01:04:55,620
It's too late!

364
01:05:32,896 --> 01:05:34,830
Quick. Quick, get in.

365
01:05:38,402 --> 01:05:40,529
We need to take the talisman
from the Machine.

366
01:05:40,604 --> 01:05:42,231
It can be used against it.

367
01:05:42,305 --> 01:05:44,535
I'll lure it to me,
and then you'll have a chance.

368
01:05:44,608 --> 01:05:48,044
No. Nine, don't do this.
What if you're wrong?

369
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:51,103
I'll show you how to use it.
It'll be okay.

370
01:05:54,785 --> 01:05:56,150
This is the sequence.

371
01:06:33,557 --> 01:06:34,649
No!

372
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:38,890
Please, we can't
do this with out you.

373
01:06:40,397 --> 01:06:42,558
They all died
because of me.

374
01:06:42,866 --> 01:06:45,733
I started this and
now I need to finish it.

375
01:06:49,406 --> 01:06:52,500
<i>They left us nothing.
Nothing.</i>

376
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:56,474
<i>Why do we have to
right their wrongs?</i>

377
01:06:57,214 --> 01:07:00,843
<i>Sometimes,
one must be sacrificed.</i>

378
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,080
No!

379
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:15,724
You did it!

380
01:08:18,228 --> 01:08:20,321
No, I didn't.

381
01:08:23,233 --> 01:08:24,530
Not yet.

382
01:11:19,642 --> 01:11:21,371
They're free now.

383
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:54,371
<i>What happens next?</i>

384
01:11:55,111 --> 01:11:57,102
<i>I'm not sure, exactly.</i>

385
01:11:57,947 --> 01:12:00,142
<i>But this world is ours now.</i>

386
01:12:01,918 --> 01:12:04,011
<i>It's what we make of it.</i>
