1
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,984
Mom, there's a cuckoo over there.

00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,557
IVAN'S CHILDHOOD

3
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,928
Based upon the story "Ivan"
by V. Bogomolov

00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:09,470
Directed by Andrei TARKOVSKY

6
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:26,585
Comrade Senior Lieutenant!Comrade Senior Lieutenant!

7
00:06:27,342 --> 00:06:28,672
What is it?

8
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:33,893
We detained someone... The lieutenant
told me to bring him to you.

9
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,896
Light the lamp.

10
00:06:53,278 --> 00:06:55,404
He was crouching in the river,
near the bank.

11
00:06:55,868 --> 00:06:59,407
He won't say why,
nor answer any questions.

12
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,216
He says he'll only talk
to the commander.

13
00:07:05,975 --> 00:07:09,598
He must be very weak,
or just pretending.

14
00:07:10,861 --> 00:07:12,904
The second lieutenant's ordered
to bring him here.

15
00:07:13,827 --> 00:07:16,915
Stand by the stove.
Who are you?

16
00:07:18,003 --> 00:07:19,832
First, send him out.

17
00:07:21,971 --> 00:07:24,382
Wait outside. I'll call you.

18
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:39,967
Well? Say something.
Where are you from?

19
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:44,062
I'm Bondarev.

20
00:07:45,568 --> 00:07:49,702
Tell number 51 at HQ
that I'm here.

21
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,332
And who's number 51?

22
00:07:53,545 --> 00:07:56,384
What HQ do you mean?
What army?

23
00:07:58,348 --> 00:08:01,353
Code address: VCH-49550.

24
00:08:03,485 --> 00:08:06,740
Come on, strip
and rub yourself down.

25
00:08:16,182 --> 00:08:18,224
Here. Take it, it's dirty, anyway.

26
00:08:18,897 --> 00:08:21,438
Take off your pants, too.
Don't be bashful.

27
00:08:25,496 --> 00:08:27,538
What's that on your back?

28
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:31,583
Answer me!

29
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:34,724
None of your business.
And don't shout at me.

30
00:08:36,354 --> 00:08:39,110
You just tell HQ I'm here.

31
00:08:39,863 --> 00:08:41,609
They'll know what to do.

32
00:08:41,826 --> 00:08:45,995
Don't you teach me.
You know where you are?

33
00:08:46,462 --> 00:08:48,504
I never heard of you.

34
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,967
You'll stay here until you tell me
who you are and where you are from.

35
00:08:56,151 --> 00:08:57,647
Are you going to speak?

36
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:06,542
If you want me to report about you,
tell me where you are from.

37
00:09:07,177 --> 00:09:09,386
- I'm from the other bank.
- What?

38
00:09:11,437 --> 00:09:15,226
And how did you get here? Can you
prove that you're from the other bank?

39
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,656
I don't have to prove anything.

40
00:09:17,869 --> 00:09:20,446
And stop questioning me!
Or you'll answer for it.

41
00:09:22,588 --> 00:09:26,972
Tell number 51 at HQ
that Bondarev's here. Now!

42
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,102
They'll know what to do.

43
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,198
Number 3?

44
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:41,747
Comrade Captain, number 8 reporting.
I've got Bondarev here.

45
00:09:41,967 --> 00:09:43,630
- Who?
- Bondarev.

46
00:09:44,432 --> 00:09:47,888
He demands that I notify "Volga".

47
00:09:48,107 --> 00:09:50,898
You mean Major Bondarev?
From the operations unit?

48
00:09:51,114 --> 00:09:54,951
No, he's not a major.
A kid about twelve years old.

49
00:09:55,165 --> 00:09:58,871
Are you kidding? What's the matter
with you? Are you sober?

50
00:09:59,634 --> 00:10:03,174
Well, I thought... Comrade Captain,
he says he came from the other side.

51
00:10:03,518 --> 00:10:08,103
Did he get here on the magic carpet?
He's just snowjobbing you.

52
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:09,694
Tell him

53
00:10:09,908 --> 00:10:13,531
that if he doesn't notify number 51,
he'll be held responsible.

54
00:10:15,212 --> 00:10:19,346
See? I reported about you
as you have asked me to.

55
00:10:19,723 --> 00:10:23,013
I was told to lock you up.

56
00:10:23,231 --> 00:10:26,153
I asked you to tell number 51 at HQ.

57
00:10:26,447 --> 00:10:28,158
And who'd you ring up?

58
00:10:28,535 --> 00:10:32,159
You expect me to personally
contact Army HQ?

59
00:10:32,461 --> 00:10:35,300
- Let me do it, then.
- Don't you dare!

60
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:39,892
Who are you going to ring up?
Who d'you know at Army HQ?

61
00:10:42,652 --> 00:10:47,451
Captain Kholin
and Colonel Gryaznov.

62
00:10:49,251 --> 00:10:52,672
Tell Colonel Gryaznov I'm here. Now.

63
00:10:54,973 --> 00:10:56,849
Or I'll do it myself.

64
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:08,502
"Baikal",
get me number 51 at "Volga".

65
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:16,178
Comrade Colonel,
Senior Lieutenant Galtsev reporting.

66
00:11:16,398 --> 00:11:18,441
I got Bondarev here. He demands...

67
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:22,300
Bondarev? Is he alone?

68
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:27,200
Galtsev!
Listen carefully, Galtsev.

69
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,925
No questions. No talking.
You got me?

70
00:11:33,522 --> 00:11:34,686
Kholin!

71
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,200
Kholin's already on his way to pick
him up. Meanwhile, be nice to him.

72
00:11:39,611 --> 00:11:41,739
See that he's comfortable.

73
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:45,125
Mind you, he has a hot temper.

74
00:11:46,219 --> 00:11:49,972
And give him a pencil and paper.

75
00:11:50,186 --> 00:11:53,809
Anything he writes send to me
immediately.

76
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:56,107
- You got me?
- Yes, sir!

77
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,631
Are you hungry?

78
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,478
I'll eat later.

79
00:12:43,144 --> 00:12:45,021
I won't look.

80
00:12:45,483 --> 00:12:46,979
Get me number 13.

81
00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:53,794
Vassiliev, bring in two pails
of hot water.

82
00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:59,970
What? Yes, I'm going to have a bath.

83
00:14:30,439 --> 00:14:32,481
Go on, wash up. I'll be back soon.

84
00:15:46,117 --> 00:15:47,578
Thanks.

85
00:17:12,613 --> 00:17:14,239
It's deep!

86
00:17:15,578 --> 00:17:16,825
Of course it is.

87
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:22,213
If a well is deep,

88
00:17:22,511 --> 00:17:26,051
you can see a star in it
even in the daytime.

89
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,814
Which star?

90
00:17:29,736 --> 00:17:31,197
Any star.

91
00:17:34,623 --> 00:17:38,496
- I see it, mom!
- Yes, there it is.

92
00:17:40,011 --> 00:17:41,293
Why is it shining?

93
00:17:41,514 --> 00:17:43,593
Because it's nighttime for the star.

94
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,062
That's why it's shining.

95
00:17:46,484 --> 00:17:48,230
Is it really nighttime now?

96
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,113
No, it's daytime.

97
00:17:51,663 --> 00:17:54,336
It's daytime for you and me,

98
00:17:55,255 --> 00:17:56,965
but it's nighttime for the star.

99
00:18:29,711 --> 00:18:30,958
Mommy!

100
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:48,921
Haven't they come yet?

101
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,304
No. Go back to sleep.
I'll wake you up when they come.

102
00:18:59,907 --> 00:19:01,950
Were you here while I was asleep?

103
00:19:02,246 --> 00:19:03,790
Yes. Why?

104
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,920
Did I talk in my sleep?

105
00:19:08,594 --> 00:19:10,637
No. Why?

106
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,017
Never mind.

107
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,496
I never used to talk in my sleep.
Now I don't know.

108
00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:24,664
I've become jittery.

109
00:19:30,855 --> 00:19:31,852
Ivan!

110
00:19:32,442 --> 00:19:33,689
Kholin!

111
00:19:41,422 --> 00:19:46,387
Katasonych is waiting for you
at the hollow tree, and you're here.

112
00:19:46,642 --> 00:19:49,433
The nazis are there.
So I swam.

113
00:19:49,649 --> 00:19:52,988
I had cramps, and nearly drowned.

114
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,288
- You mean you swam across?
- Yes. Don't get angry.

115
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,097
They're patrolling the bank.
I couldn't find our boat in the dark.

116
00:20:03,432 --> 00:20:05,094
They could catch me.

117
00:20:08,193 --> 00:20:11,899
You got so skinny.
Just a bag of bones.

118
00:20:13,957 --> 00:20:17,211
Go and bring the car up close.

119
00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:22,930
Tell the sentry not to let anyone in.

120
00:20:30,287 --> 00:20:31,617
Here, put this on.

121
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:35,125
Go on.

122
00:20:35,675 --> 00:20:36,707
Stop!

123
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:51,752
Where have you been?

124
00:20:56,766 --> 00:20:59,474
- Where are you going?
- For kerosene.

125
00:20:59,731 --> 00:21:02,273
What for? We're leaving.

126
00:21:06,414 --> 00:21:08,040
Here's to our meeting!

127
00:21:15,017 --> 00:21:20,185
Kholin, Katasonych is still waiting
for me at the hollow tree.

128
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,123
To his safe return!

129
00:21:43,585 --> 00:21:45,164
Number 2 here.

130
00:21:45,381 --> 00:21:50,298
This is number 51. Malyshev,
remember, you had an argument?

131
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:54,224
They were right. We should take
the Fyodorovka direction.

132
00:21:54,444 --> 00:21:56,653
But we've already decided...

133
00:21:57,117 --> 00:21:59,611
Save your breath, I've heard it all.

134
00:21:59,831 --> 00:22:02,041
- May I come in, Colonel?
- Yes, come in.

135
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:05,342
- What?
- I said I've heard it.

136
00:22:06,263 --> 00:22:10,848
I have absolutely reliable,
first-hand information.

137
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:17,953
Waited all night for nothing, eh,
Katasonych?

138
00:22:20,296 --> 00:22:21,543
Sit down.

139
00:22:26,895 --> 00:22:28,937
Ivan's here.

140
00:22:30,278 --> 00:22:33,533
He couldn't get to the bank
at the hollow tree.

141
00:22:35,332 --> 00:22:40,166
He says there are German patrols
everywhere.

142
00:22:43,058 --> 00:22:45,814
- How did he get here?
- He swam across.

143
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:48,065
Jesus!

144
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,822
A grown man might've drowned.

145
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,263
Well, that's it.
Enough of a good thing.

146
00:23:01,518 --> 00:23:03,145
Wait, Ivan!

147
00:23:06,154 --> 00:23:08,364
Comrade Colonel, why?

148
00:23:08,577 --> 00:23:13,043
He said I'll be sent to the rear.
To a military school, by your order.

149
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:15,300
Is that true?

150
00:23:15,802 --> 00:23:18,177
Why did you do it? You deceived me.

151
00:23:18,934 --> 00:23:23,234
An offensive is being planned.
I can still be useful.

152
00:23:24,239 --> 00:23:26,994
You yourself said that reconnaissance
is most important!

153
00:23:27,204 --> 00:23:29,745
That scouts are the soul of the front.

154
00:23:30,086 --> 00:23:31,665
You were trying to trick me!

155
00:23:33,218 --> 00:23:36,473
I'm not going! And if you force me to,
I'll run away.

156
00:23:37,562 --> 00:23:38,974
I'll join the partisans.

157
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:42,980
Ivan, you're going to a military
school. You got me?

158
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,785
And stop arguing.
I won't discuss it.

159
00:23:48,003 --> 00:23:49,665
But I will!

160
00:23:50,676 --> 00:23:55,677
Kholin, tell him I'll do a good job,
I'll be useful.

161
00:23:56,439 --> 00:23:58,019
I just can't...

162
00:23:58,277 --> 00:24:00,818
You tell him, Katasonych,
I can't go to the rear!

163
00:24:01,034 --> 00:24:04,490
The matter is closed!

164
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:19,112
All right... Military school,
or a children's home,

165
00:24:19,744 --> 00:24:21,371
it's all the same to me.

166
00:25:43,107 --> 00:25:44,438
Be quiet...

167
00:26:18,942 --> 00:26:22,280
The stove and chimney
will stand forever.

168
00:26:30,177 --> 00:26:34,560
Where is it?
I put it here.

169
00:26:40,451 --> 00:26:41,864
Are you going far?

170
00:26:42,623 --> 00:26:44,035
Yes.

171
00:26:45,296 --> 00:26:48,752
Right.
Everybody's going far nowadays.

172
00:26:50,892 --> 00:26:54,396
But why?
Who knows?

173
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,865
I lost a nail.

174
00:27:00,707 --> 00:27:03,462
Could you help me find it?
You have nothing to do, anyway.

175
00:27:03,672 --> 00:27:04,919
Come in.

176
00:27:06,888 --> 00:27:12,685
The stove and chimney
will never burn down.

177
00:27:13,445 --> 00:27:16,154
Here's a straight nail.

178
00:27:21,757 --> 00:27:23,134
No, it won't do.

179
00:27:30,318 --> 00:27:32,694
Where's your ma? Alive?

180
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:39,506
A nazi shot my old woman, too.

181
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:46,897
Where can it be?
I saw it a minute ago.

182
00:27:47,693 --> 00:27:49,319
He was a tall fellow...

183
00:27:51,619 --> 00:27:52,616
He wore glasses.

184
00:27:56,422 --> 00:27:58,381
And had long hair.

185
00:28:01,183 --> 00:28:03,938
- What's your name?
- Ivan.

186
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,740
Pelageya will be back soon...
That's my wife's name.

187
00:28:10,413 --> 00:28:12,622
I'll have the house all ready for her.

188
00:28:23,485 --> 00:28:24,483
Ivan!

189
00:28:32,507 --> 00:28:34,051
Why'd you run away, Vanya?

190
00:28:34,261 --> 00:28:38,311
You think I have nothing better to do
than chasing after you?

191
00:28:38,521 --> 00:28:40,397
I didn't ask you to.

192
00:28:40,609 --> 00:28:44,743
Don't talk back at me. Look at him,
he wants to join the partisans!

193
00:28:44,953 --> 00:28:48,207
Get into the car!
You won't run away again.

194
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:49,416
Yes, I will.

195
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,673
I said get into the car!

196
00:29:07,506 --> 00:29:09,548
I'll run away
from that military school,

197
00:29:09,761 --> 00:29:12,683
just like I did from the children's
home.

198
00:29:14,731 --> 00:29:17,736
"I ran away from Granny,
And from Granddad, too..."

199
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:04,880
O Lord,
will this ever end?

200
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:23,821
Vanya, can't you understand, silly,
that war is for grown men?

201
00:30:34,565 --> 00:30:37,142
You promised you won't issue
that order!

202
00:30:38,909 --> 00:30:44,456
Lyakhov and Moroz were killed because
they were big. I can get through.

203
00:30:46,051 --> 00:30:50,434
Besides, I'm all alone.
You know I have no family left.

204
00:30:50,645 --> 00:30:52,687
That's enough, Vanya.

205
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,145
It's been decided.

206
00:30:55,364 --> 00:30:57,158
Nothing is decided!

207
00:30:57,703 --> 00:31:02,205
You're not my dad to decide.

208
00:31:03,801 --> 00:31:05,595
Shut up!

209
00:31:12,697 --> 00:31:14,276
Or I'll spank you.

210
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:27,605
I'll run away anyway,
if you don't let me go.

211
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:29,609
I'm my own boss.

212
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:36,669
Indeed!

213
00:31:38,967 --> 00:31:40,927
You're my pain in the neck.

214
00:32:05,237 --> 00:32:07,613
D'you know that there's lice
in Company 5?

215
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,706
The linen isn't disinfected properly.

216
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:15,125
Do something about it.

217
00:32:16,013 --> 00:32:17,639
Yes, Comrade Senior Lieutenant!

218
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:20,226
The situation is out of control.

219
00:32:22,027 --> 00:32:23,191
Yes, sir.

220
00:32:24,825 --> 00:32:28,698
There'll be no time for that
when the offensive begins.

221
00:32:36,979 --> 00:32:39,021
Yes, Comrade Senior Lieutenant!

222
00:32:56,733 --> 00:32:58,527
Thank you, Comrade Senior Lieutenant.

223
00:32:58,738 --> 00:33:01,577
- A letter from home?
- Yes.

224
00:33:01,954 --> 00:33:05,244
- Everything all right?
- Yes.

225
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,749
Greetings!
I've been looking for you.

226
00:33:25,301 --> 00:33:28,222
Carry on. I'll wait here.

227
00:33:29,101 --> 00:33:33,235
You're a commander. You must be
strict with your subordinates.

228
00:33:33,863 --> 00:33:36,274
But you try to do everything yourself.

229
00:33:37,204 --> 00:33:39,246
There's a lull now, and we have time.

230
00:33:39,459 --> 00:33:43,165
When the offensive starts,
there'll be the wounded.

231
00:33:44,095 --> 00:33:46,720
I don't know what to do about you.

232
00:33:49,733 --> 00:33:52,904
Since you're a commander,
get the medical service in order.

233
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:56,989
You've got two days. Then report back
to me.

234
00:33:57,585 --> 00:33:59,628
Yes, Comrade Senior Lieutenant.

235
00:34:00,425 --> 00:34:04,559
Don't worry.
Everything'll be... in order.

236
00:34:20,264 --> 00:34:23,720
What's your name, Lieutenant?

237
00:34:25,693 --> 00:34:29,447
- Masha.
- That's a pretty name.

238
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:52,335
My name's Leonid.
Lennie for short.

239
00:34:56,056 --> 00:35:00,190
Have you ever had a boyfriend
called Lennie?

240
00:35:00,985 --> 00:35:03,230
- No.
- So I'm the first?

241
00:35:09,254 --> 00:35:10,536
Are you from the Ukraine?

242
00:35:10,758 --> 00:35:14,345
- Why?
- You're beautiful and stubborn.

243
00:35:15,978 --> 00:35:21,324
No, I come from near Moscow.
Peredelkino. Twenty minutes by train.

244
00:35:21,867 --> 00:35:25,407
In Siberia, where I come from,
300 km is considered "near".

245
00:35:27,088 --> 00:35:32,801
Surikov, the painter, used to live in
our town. Ever heard of him?

246
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:36,015
And in our town, writers used to live.

247
00:35:36,694 --> 00:35:39,319
We once saw Alexei Tolstoy.

248
00:35:39,534 --> 00:35:42,622
And Korney Chukovsky.
He's very tall, with a white head.

249
00:35:46,091 --> 00:35:47,920
They were walking in the woods.

250
00:35:48,931 --> 00:35:51,259
- Were you ever wounded?
- Yes, I was.

251
00:35:53,191 --> 00:35:58,109
Why are we so formal?
Let's be on first name basis.

252
00:36:00,166 --> 00:36:03,005
- I find it hard to so quickly.
- And I don't.

253
00:36:05,888 --> 00:36:08,132
I'll start now, and you start
gradually, okay?

254
00:36:09,145 --> 00:36:11,521
- What is it?
- A cobweb!

255
00:36:11,735 --> 00:36:15,073
So what? Aren't you a brave soldier!

256
00:36:16,788 --> 00:36:19,710
Some brave commander!

257
00:36:22,009 --> 00:36:24,682
I'm only afraid of spiders.

258
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,221
Nothing else?

259
00:36:30,696 --> 00:36:34,152
Vassiliev!
Have you seen Captain Kholin?

260
00:36:34,622 --> 00:36:39,968
He went that way with the doctor's assistant.

261
00:36:54,836 --> 00:36:58,091
Walk the trunk! You said
you're not afraid of anything.

262
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,267
Well, I will.

263
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:15,915
That's enough.

264
00:37:21,107 --> 00:37:22,817
Jump! I'll catch you.

265
00:37:34,388 --> 00:37:35,765
Got scared?

266
00:37:38,564 --> 00:37:39,847
Then why don't you?

267
00:37:40,945 --> 00:37:42,145
No special reason.

268
00:37:49,883 --> 00:37:51,129
So you were frightened?

269
00:37:53,266 --> 00:37:56,556
All right, I forgive you.

270
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:59,483
I don't need your forgiveness.

271
00:38:00,115 --> 00:38:01,315
You don't?

272
00:38:07,716 --> 00:38:09,759
- Let me help you.
- I'll manage.

273
00:38:09,972 --> 00:38:11,349
She'll manage!

274
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,597
Come here, Masha.

275
00:38:51,737 --> 00:38:52,936
What for?

276
00:38:54,702 --> 00:38:56,662
Come on, Masha, come here.

277
00:38:57,124 --> 00:38:58,324
What for?

278
00:38:59,589 --> 00:39:00,835
Come here, quick!

279
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,557
Hurry!

280
00:39:25,775 --> 00:39:29,648
Now go away...
Go away, Masha.

281
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:33,459
You hear me, Masha? Go!

282
00:39:34,128 --> 00:39:35,755
Go away quick, Masha...

283
00:40:28,005 --> 00:40:31,094
Let's go and have a look
at your troops.

284
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:40,200
There they are, Lyakhov and Moroz.

285
00:40:41,997 --> 00:40:43,409
Go have a smoke.

286
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,790
- Good morning!
- Hello, Katasonych.

287
00:40:48,888 --> 00:40:50,930
Galtsev, give me the defense line map.

288
00:40:53,398 --> 00:40:58,233
Wait for me in your "underground".
I'll be right back.

289
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:08,511
Comrade Senior Lieutenant,
the gunners gave me a record.

290
00:41:08,726 --> 00:41:12,646
They say you have a gramophone.
Could we listen to it?

291
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:16,407
- The gramophone's broken.
- I'll fix it.

292
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,414
Thanks, Katasonych.

293
00:41:24,806 --> 00:41:29,439
This place is best, Captain.

294
00:41:30,444 --> 00:41:33,818
But where will we land?
What d'you say, Katasonych?

295
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:40,758
In those bushes.
It's a safe place.

296
00:41:42,013 --> 00:41:44,174
Only be sure to tell the gunners

297
00:41:44,394 --> 00:41:46,853
to leave us a corridor.

298
00:41:48,278 --> 00:41:51,485
WELCOME

299
00:41:54,543 --> 00:41:57,037
Damn! Couldn't you have dug
a deeper one?

300
00:41:58,218 --> 00:42:00,973
D'you know who's sitting there,
on the other bank?

301
00:42:01,183 --> 00:42:02,264
I know.

302
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:06,066
Then why can't you bring them here?
It'll take but an hour.

303
00:42:08,743 --> 00:42:12,366
- Have you got any boats?
- No.

304
00:42:13,546 --> 00:42:15,125
You're lying.

305
00:42:15,634 --> 00:42:17,843
- What for?
- I need them.

306
00:42:19,267 --> 00:42:21,144
You are not even good at lying.

307
00:42:21,356 --> 00:42:24,444
- They're for the landing party.
- That's what I need them for.

308
00:42:27,036 --> 00:42:29,411
Are you and Katasonych planning
a scouting mission?

309
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:32,714
No, a picnic
with your gramophone.

310
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,718
Will Ivan go again?

311
00:42:34,929 --> 00:42:38,267
Ivan, Ivan...
I'm not an information bureau.

312
00:42:47,041 --> 00:42:50,379
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.

313
00:42:50,758 --> 00:42:53,597
You've got a pretty doctor's assistant.

314
00:42:54,601 --> 00:42:57,689
I'm sending her away.
She can't cope with the job.

315
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:02,485
Aren't you severe, Galtsev!
Have a heart.

316
00:43:04,959 --> 00:43:07,500
War is a man's business.

317
00:43:07,715 --> 00:43:09,591
It's not for girls.

318
00:43:10,012 --> 00:43:14,229
All right, go. I don't need you here.
Some man!

319
00:43:19,994 --> 00:43:22,749
Excuse me, are you Masha?

320
00:43:23,836 --> 00:43:25,001
Yes.

321
00:43:25,298 --> 00:43:27,709
Don't you remember me?

322
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,637
No, I don't.

323
00:43:30,853 --> 00:43:35,438
We took the college entrance exams
together.

324
00:43:36,616 --> 00:43:39,027
Yes... now I do.

325
00:43:40,459 --> 00:43:42,169
I'm so glad I met you!

326
00:43:45,137 --> 00:43:46,217
Me, too.

327
00:43:46,431 --> 00:43:51,515
I'm glad I saw you.
Where'd you go after the exams?

328
00:43:51,777 --> 00:43:55,151
I looked everywhere...
Now I've found you, Masha.

329
00:43:55,494 --> 00:43:56,575
I'm coming!

330
00:43:56,789 --> 00:43:59,034
I've found you!
We'll meet again, won't we?

331
00:43:59,253 --> 00:44:01,295
We'll meet again, Masha!

332
00:44:01,843 --> 00:44:03,220
We'll meet again!

333
00:44:49,622 --> 00:44:52,710
WELCOME

334
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:17,714
Captain!
- That's you, Katasonych!

335
00:45:17,724 --> 00:45:20,267
- We are here.
- Good.

336
00:45:25,993 --> 00:45:28,701
Hello, Kholin!
- Hello, Ivan!

337
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,638
Ivan?

338
00:45:37,812 --> 00:45:39,938
- Hello.
- Hello.

339
00:45:40,694 --> 00:45:42,903
Give us a hand, Galtsev.

340
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:46,202
- Hello, Katasonov!
- Hello, sir!

341
00:46:09,846 --> 00:46:15,690
Give us something interesting,
Galtsev, some magazines.

342
00:46:16,612 --> 00:46:18,239
With lots of pictures.

343
00:46:26,093 --> 00:46:27,553
Come here.

344
00:46:32,608 --> 00:46:36,064
- Here. This one's about scouts.
- I've read it.

345
00:46:37,244 --> 00:46:40,165
- How about this one?
- This one, too.

346
00:46:41,588 --> 00:46:43,879
- And this one?
- This, too.

347
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:46,844
- You're lying!
- I'm not.

348
00:46:47,059 --> 00:46:50,147
I was stuck at HQ all this time.

349
00:46:51,068 --> 00:46:53,907
I did nothing but read for 3 days.

350
00:46:54,493 --> 00:46:58,496
I got you a spring for the gramophone
at HQ.

351
00:46:59,254 --> 00:47:02,343
Thanks, Katasonych.
It's under the bed.

352
00:47:02,637 --> 00:47:06,343
- What's this, so big?
- An art book. Captured material.

353
00:47:06,897 --> 00:47:09,736
- Any pictures in it?
- It's all pictures.

354
00:47:09,946 --> 00:47:10,943
Give it to me.

355
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:14,371
You should've listened to him sprechen.
Like a real Fritz.

356
00:47:15,459 --> 00:47:19,759
I wanted to make him an interpreter,
now he's in command of a battalion.

357
00:47:21,014 --> 00:47:25,148
Look!
Are these Germans?

358
00:47:26,569 --> 00:47:27,946
Yes, it's an old engraving.

359
00:47:28,573 --> 00:47:30,200
They're Germans, all the same.

360
00:47:30,829 --> 00:47:33,917
Look at this skinny one on a horse.

361
00:47:35,548 --> 00:47:37,923
I saw one just like him
on a motorcycle.

362
00:47:41,437 --> 00:47:44,442
Look, they're killing the people here, too.

363
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,691
It's just a painting.

364
00:47:47,618 --> 00:47:50,623
No... I know them.

365
00:47:53,549 --> 00:47:55,675
Who is this? A German?

366
00:47:56,264 --> 00:48:00,017
He's either a German doctor, or writer.

367
00:48:00,732 --> 00:48:02,277
They have no writers.

368
00:48:02,695 --> 00:48:05,320
I saw them burning books
on the square.

369
00:48:06,788 --> 00:48:09,080
They poured petrol over them
and set them on fire.

370
00:48:10,213 --> 00:48:11,875
There was soot in the air for a week
after that.

371
00:48:12,093 --> 00:48:14,883
This writer lived
about 400 years ago.

372
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,270
Well, then maybe...

373
00:48:17,856 --> 00:48:21,444
If they spot us,
our gunners will keep them down.

374
00:48:21,991 --> 00:48:24,117
We'll leave Ivan a passage
in the swamp.

375
00:48:27,546 --> 00:48:29,339
I retreat last.

376
00:48:31,221 --> 00:48:32,385
Got it?

377
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,354
What's this?

378
00:48:36,275 --> 00:48:39,862
I think I'd better take
one of Galtsev's boats.

379
00:48:40,952 --> 00:48:43,114
- Will you take me along?
- Where to?

380
00:48:43,416 --> 00:48:44,829
To the other bank.

381
00:48:45,129 --> 00:48:47,968
A volunteer, eh?

382
00:48:52,813 --> 00:48:54,476
Can you swim?

383
00:48:54,693 --> 00:48:57,781
Don't you worry. I can swim
this river and back 5 times.

384
00:48:57,992 --> 00:49:03,374
What a hero.
Are you trigger-happy, too?

385
00:49:04,215 --> 00:49:05,546
Stop it.

386
00:49:06,471 --> 00:49:08,597
You see? He's so touchy.

387
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:15,281
No self-control.
How can I take you across?

388
00:49:15,617 --> 00:49:19,667
- Then you don't get a boat.
- We'll commandeer it.

389
00:49:20,629 --> 00:49:24,502
Or I'll report you to the Commander,
and you'll bring it to us on your back.

390
00:49:24,722 --> 00:49:27,395
Come on, stop it.
He'll give us a boat.

391
00:49:27,604 --> 00:49:28,934
Am I right?

392
00:49:31,864 --> 00:49:33,740
All right. Let's go have a look.

393
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,332
You stay here and rest up.

394
00:49:46,315 --> 00:49:47,859
Wow! What a knife!

395
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:51,324
Listen, Galtsev, would you give it
to me?

396
00:49:54,501 --> 00:49:56,163
I would, Vanya, but...

397
00:49:56,422 --> 00:49:58,382
Don't be a miser. Give it to him.

398
00:49:58,928 --> 00:50:02,348
This is a memento.
It was my buddy's. He was killed.

399
00:50:06,571 --> 00:50:09,659
- Let me have it till tonight.
- All right.

400
00:50:14,088 --> 00:50:18,306
Why should I go with you? You're not
taking me across, right?

401
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:22,733
Come on. I'll take you,
but not today. After the war.

402
00:50:38,521 --> 00:50:39,934
It's okay now.

403
00:50:42,697 --> 00:50:45,156
We'll listen to it after supper.

404
00:51:11,015 --> 00:51:13,058
I'll get you a knife just like it.

405
00:51:14,565 --> 00:51:16,276
I'll get one tomorrow.

406
00:51:25,299 --> 00:51:26,712
By all means.

407
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:51,771
Where're his parents?

408
00:51:51,987 --> 00:51:53,781
- Whose?
- Ivan's.

409
00:51:54,869 --> 00:51:59,002
I don't know. They say
his mother and sister were killed.

410
00:52:00,173 --> 00:52:02,846
His dad was a border guard.
I guess he was killed in action.

411
00:52:03,723 --> 00:52:04,923
Really?

412
00:52:05,728 --> 00:52:09,351
He's been through more
than you can imagine.

413
00:52:09,904 --> 00:52:12,993
He was a partisan, too.
He knocked about the world.

414
00:52:13,204 --> 00:52:14,236
What'll become of him?

415
00:52:14,457 --> 00:52:19,803
The colonel or Katasonych will adopt
him when the war's over.

416
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:22,054
Why them and not you?

417
00:52:25,399 --> 00:52:28,939
I would,
but the colonel says

418
00:52:29,408 --> 00:52:32,413
I need some upbringing myself.

419
00:52:33,752 --> 00:52:38,504
Katasonych!
He's really good at stealing boats.

420
00:52:39,516 --> 00:52:41,178
He'll never take a bad one.

421
00:52:42,105 --> 00:52:45,645
Tell us, Galtsev,
how many owners have you ripped off?

422
00:52:45,947 --> 00:52:47,693
- Which one?
- Take this one.

423
00:52:48,829 --> 00:52:50,242
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

424
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:53,547
He should be sent to the rear.
A war is no place for children.

425
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:55,297
Stop it, will you?

426
00:52:55,512 --> 00:52:59,016
You see, Lieutenant,
if we don't take him across,

427
00:52:59,271 --> 00:53:01,313
he'll go on his own.

428
00:53:02,653 --> 00:53:05,825
All he can think of...

429
00:53:07,874 --> 00:53:09,668
is vengeance.

430
00:53:09,879 --> 00:53:15,225
Don't waste your breath explaining.
They can't see here beyond their nose.

431
00:53:15,434 --> 00:53:19,057
Didn't you say
you wanted to adopt him, and now...

432
00:53:20,654 --> 00:53:24,609
What's the matter with you?
Get lost! We'll manage without you.

433
00:53:24,914 --> 00:53:26,161
That's not the way to do it.

434
00:53:26,418 --> 00:53:28,378
- All right, Kholin...
- Don't Kholin me!

435
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:31,761
The colonel is right.
You do need upbringing.

436
00:53:34,771 --> 00:53:39,404
Watch out, or I'll report you
to the commander.

437
00:54:20,086 --> 00:54:24,386
Well... keep cool.

438
00:54:25,766 --> 00:54:27,595
That's the main thing.

439
00:54:39,757 --> 00:54:42,596
Slowly... carefully.

440
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:46,394
And remember,
we have to get him alive.

441
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:48,731
Got it?

442
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:16,375
THERE ARE 8 OF US.
ALL UNDER 19.

443
00:55:19,058 --> 00:55:23,192
IN AN HOUR FROM NOW
THEY'LL SHOOT US.

444
00:55:23,402 --> 00:55:26,110
AVENGE US.

445
00:56:32,607 --> 00:56:34,103
Hurrah!

446
00:56:39,056 --> 00:56:42,762
Surround the building!
Don't let him out!

447
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:51,832
Hands up! Come out!

448
00:56:55,762 --> 00:56:59,635
So you're hiding!
You can't hide from me!

449
00:57:01,508 --> 00:57:03,337
Are you shaking?

450
00:57:04,724 --> 00:57:10,152
You'll answer for everything!
I'II...

451
00:57:13,161 --> 00:57:14,954
D'you think I've forgotten?

452
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:17,626
I'll put you on trial!

453
00:57:20,094 --> 00:57:23,015
I'II... I'II...

454
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:07,742
Want some tea,
Comrade Captain.

455
00:58:07,956 --> 00:58:11,496
Damn! It was our best boat!

456
00:58:15,808 --> 00:58:20,108
You're lucky to be alive.
Forget the boat.

457
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:29,170
Faster! Hurry!

458
00:58:33,391 --> 00:58:35,221
Can you hurry up?

459
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:06,474
Ivan!

460
00:59:13,997 --> 00:59:15,791
Don't be afraid. It'll be over soon.

461
00:59:23,853 --> 00:59:25,266
What is it, Ivan?

462
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:29,692
I'm not afraid.

463
01:00:06,165 --> 01:00:08,207
I hear you were a partisan.

464
01:00:09,381 --> 01:00:13,336
- Why'd you leave them?
- We were surrounded in the woods.

465
01:00:14,267 --> 01:00:18,484
They sent me out by plane
to a boarding school.

466
01:00:19,488 --> 01:00:21,198
But I ran away.

467
01:00:21,994 --> 01:00:24,036
They're just wasting food there.

468
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:27,711
Memorizing names of reptiles.

469
01:00:28,342 --> 01:00:34,389
Yeah, that's not for you. You ought
to go to a military school.

470
01:00:36,194 --> 01:00:37,738
Did Kholin make you say so?

471
01:00:37,948 --> 01:00:41,618
Why Kholin?
He's not the only one with brains.

472
01:00:43,085 --> 01:00:44,498
I think so, too.

473
01:00:44,714 --> 01:00:48,052
You've done your fighting.
Rest up, go back to school.

474
01:00:48,473 --> 01:00:52,856
Whoever's of use
doesn't rest up in wartime.

475
01:00:54,487 --> 01:00:58,241
Right. But war isn't for boys.

476
01:00:58,914 --> 01:01:02,502
Not for boys?
Have you been to Trostyanets?

477
01:01:03,174 --> 01:01:05,716
- Where?
- That's a death camp.

478
01:01:06,223 --> 01:01:09,014
Why are you teaching me?

479
01:01:08,606 --> 01:01:12,740
What do you know?
You're all together in it.

480
01:01:58,763 --> 01:02:02,018
Smoking again?
Go on, smoke.

481
01:02:03,566 --> 01:02:05,776
It'll turn you lungs green.

482
01:02:06,407 --> 01:02:10,540
So what?
Nobody can see them.

483
01:02:13,632 --> 01:02:16,803
- I don't want you to smoke.
- Okay, I won't.

484
01:02:18,602 --> 01:02:21,690
We'll start out in an hour and a half.
Let's have supper.

485
01:02:21,901 --> 01:02:26,119
- Where's Katasonych?
- He was summoned to HQ.

486
01:02:26,871 --> 01:02:31,706
Why didn't he stop by
to wish me good luck?

487
01:02:31,925 --> 01:02:34,217
He couldn't. It was an emergency.

488
01:02:50,085 --> 01:02:52,544
Why'd they summon him?

489
01:03:18,778 --> 01:03:22,828
They know how badly we need him.
And they summoned him all the same.

490
01:03:25,126 --> 01:03:27,965
A fine friend! He could've stopped by.

491
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:33,893
Will it be just the two of us?

492
01:03:35,317 --> 01:03:38,072
The three of us. He'll go, too.

493
01:03:41,414 --> 01:03:45,252
Stop grinning. And don't stare at me.

494
01:03:45,466 --> 01:03:49,171
You volunteered, didn't you?
Are you frightened now?

495
01:03:49,851 --> 01:03:51,893
No, I'm not. It's sort of unexpected.

496
01:03:53,067 --> 01:03:56,321
Unexpected...
Everything in life is.

497
01:03:56,909 --> 01:03:59,119
- May I come in?
- Yes.

498
01:04:05,931 --> 01:04:07,308
What's up?

499
01:04:08,395 --> 01:04:10,770
We billeted the new men, Lieutenant.

500
01:04:13,323 --> 01:04:16,078
- Where?
- In Companies Two and Three.

501
01:04:16,622 --> 01:04:20,412
- Very well. You may go.
- Yes, sir.

502
01:04:24,307 --> 01:04:27,396
I wouldn't take you,
but it's an emergency.

503
01:04:27,607 --> 01:04:33,119
Make up your mind.
No complaints afterwards.

504
01:04:36,586 --> 01:04:38,415
What d'you think I am?

505
01:04:39,092 --> 01:04:44,259
All right.
Who'll you leave in command?

506
01:04:44,814 --> 01:04:49,399
I think, Guschin,
of Company 5.

507
01:04:52,165 --> 01:04:57,129
If they learn you crossed the river

508
01:04:57,970 --> 01:04:59,764
without permission...

509
01:05:01,812 --> 01:05:04,022
we'll be in trouble.

510
01:05:05,362 --> 01:05:09,947
Although it won't take more
than two or three hours.

511
01:05:11,794 --> 01:05:13,836
AVENGE US

512
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:34,012
Wake up, Ivan!
Do you hear? It's time.

513
01:07:37,982 --> 01:07:40,441
Katasonych didn't even stop by.

514
01:07:41,448 --> 01:07:43,159
I told you he couldn't.

515
01:07:44,414 --> 01:07:48,037
You know how he loves you.
Don't you?

516
01:07:48,423 --> 01:07:51,512
I know.
But still, he could have...

517
01:07:54,604 --> 01:07:56,481
Here. Get dressed.

518
01:07:57,820 --> 01:08:00,065
- Need any help?
- No.

519
01:09:45,992 --> 01:09:47,322
Let's jump.

520
01:09:50,085 --> 01:09:51,498
To see if anything rattles.

521
01:09:55,097 --> 01:09:56,557
Dump your matches.

522
01:10:19,195 --> 01:10:20,822
Are you crazy?

523
01:10:51,563 --> 01:10:53,273
Crews, take your positions.

524
01:10:55,656 --> 01:10:59,790
Go chat with the sentry
so he won't notice us... Got it?

525
01:11:01,921 --> 01:11:03,797
And no comments!

526
01:11:11,151 --> 01:11:12,612
Got a light?

527
01:11:31,699 --> 01:11:33,279
Who's that?

528
01:11:37,881 --> 01:11:42,964
It was all so stupid...

529
01:11:44,062 --> 01:11:46,521
They brought the boat here
and had a smoke...

530
01:11:47,528 --> 01:11:49,987
The captain was here.
He was over there...

531
01:11:51,538 --> 01:11:53,997
He started climbing out of the trench.

532
01:11:54,670 --> 01:11:59,588
And then he slid back down.

533
01:12:01,018 --> 01:12:03,310
We didn't even hear a shot.

534
01:12:04,944 --> 01:12:08,900
The captain shook him up:
"Katasonych! Katasonych!"

535
01:12:09,288 --> 01:12:12,709
But he was dead.

536
01:12:13,799 --> 01:12:17,504
The captain said to leave him here...
till morning.

537
01:12:20,523 --> 01:12:23,314
Don't discuss it.
Get the oars.

538
01:13:56,374 --> 01:14:00,792
Who's that?
Who's that, Kholin?

539
01:14:01,427 --> 01:14:04,765
That's our men.
Lyakhov and Moroz.

540
01:14:05,228 --> 01:14:07,140
They went across after you.

541
01:14:26,152 --> 01:14:27,862
There's still time.

542
01:15:22,201 --> 01:15:24,493
Wait here. I'll be right back.

543
01:15:28,299 --> 01:15:31,387
- Come over here. It's dryer here.
- Makes no difference now.

544
01:15:33,770 --> 01:15:35,017
MG-34.

545
01:15:35,232 --> 01:15:37,773
- Are you nervous?
- A bit.

546
01:15:38,990 --> 01:15:44,502
I've become jittery lately.
Can't get used to begging.

547
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:48,840
They should be buried.

548
01:15:49,056 --> 01:15:52,227
- Who?
- Lyakhov and Moroz.

549
01:15:53,065 --> 01:15:55,821
Sure, we'll do it.

550
01:15:56,114 --> 01:16:01,828
Quiet! Everything's tiptop.
Let's go.

551
01:16:08,142 --> 01:16:10,352
This is the place, guys.

552
01:16:49,615 --> 01:16:51,944
- How do you feel?
- Fine.

553
01:16:52,163 --> 01:16:55,417
- Well, I'll be going.
- I'll go a part of the way with you.

554
01:16:55,671 --> 01:16:57,713
No, you're too big. They'll catch on.

555
01:16:57,926 --> 01:16:59,257
Let me go.

556
01:16:59,472 --> 01:17:02,643
The gully's clayey. You'll leave
footprints. I'll carry you over.

557
01:17:02,855 --> 01:17:04,731
I said I'm going alone.

558
01:17:07,031 --> 01:17:09,490
- See you soon.
- See you.

559
01:17:14,841 --> 01:17:19,426
I'll see you.
Be careful.

560
01:17:19,895 --> 01:17:23,850
If the offensive starts,
meet us in Fyodorovka. Got it?

561
01:17:25,575 --> 01:17:28,200
- See you soon.
- Goodbye, Vanya.

562
01:18:53,365 --> 01:18:54,695
What's up?

563
01:18:55,871 --> 01:18:57,498
I want a smoke.

564
01:18:57,709 --> 01:19:00,548
- Want your mommy, too?
- Cut it out.

565
01:19:01,175 --> 01:19:04,715
I, for one, really do want my ma.
Won't it be good, eh?

566
01:19:27,738 --> 01:19:31,491
- They'll notice the boat!
- What if they spot Ivan?

567
01:19:32,332 --> 01:19:34,541
Are you a louse, or plain stupid?

568
01:19:35,214 --> 01:19:36,496
Just stupid.

569
01:19:36,717 --> 01:19:41,267
See a doctor about your nerves
when the war's over.

570
01:19:43,650 --> 01:19:46,026
Damn! It's a clayey gully!

571
01:19:46,783 --> 01:19:49,954
What we need now is a good rain
to wash away all footprints.

572
01:19:55,386 --> 01:19:56,931
I think he made it.

573
01:20:03,155 --> 01:20:05,197
Wait here for me.
I'll go for the boat.

574
01:20:08,793 --> 01:20:11,714
When I come back,
call out to me in German.

575
01:20:11,925 --> 01:20:14,051
- Try it.
- Halt!

576
01:20:14,891 --> 01:20:17,136
If I'm caught, swim back.

577
01:20:17,355 --> 01:20:19,516
You said you could swim this river
and back five times.

578
01:20:24,538 --> 01:20:26,165
What if you're wounded?

579
01:20:27,587 --> 01:20:29,298
Don't worry about me.

580
01:20:50,568 --> 01:20:51,733
Halt!Halt!!

581
01:20:52,740 --> 01:20:55,317
Quiet!
Damn you! Come here!

582
01:21:04,685 --> 01:21:06,098
Hurry up!

583
01:21:12,662 --> 01:21:15,501
Is that them?

584
01:21:15,711 --> 01:21:19,334
Yes.
Them yesterday, us today.

585
01:21:21,433 --> 01:21:22,633
Climb in.

586
01:21:26,152 --> 01:21:28,481
- Are things quiet on the bank?
- Yes.

587
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:30,742
See? Nothing to fear.

588
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:43,854
Where are you going?
Why aren't we going back?

589
01:21:44,278 --> 01:21:45,691
It's the first snow of the year.

590
01:21:45,907 --> 01:21:46,988
Kholin!

591
01:21:47,327 --> 01:21:50,582
What if he hasn't passed yet?
He might still be hiding, waiting.

592
01:22:14,099 --> 01:22:15,476
Jump in the water!

593
01:23:50,868 --> 01:23:52,448
Let's drink to...

594
01:24:59,530 --> 01:25:01,906
May I come in,
Comrade Senior Lieutenant?

595
01:25:10,306 --> 01:25:11,470
Masha!

596
01:25:13,271 --> 01:25:18,521
Who were you talking to
on the road the other day?

597
01:25:26,385 --> 01:25:29,141
- Your friend?
- Yes, my friend.

598
01:25:32,065 --> 01:25:35,938
The one... that wore glasses?

599
01:25:37,286 --> 01:25:38,948
He wasn't wearing glasses.

600
01:25:39,458 --> 01:25:43,247
But he was!
He is strange.

601
01:25:43,885 --> 01:25:45,345
No, he isn't.

602
01:25:45,555 --> 01:25:49,309
- What is it, Lieutenant?
- I've come to say goodbye.

603
01:25:52,071 --> 01:25:55,409
I'm transferring her to a hospital.

604
01:26:02,345 --> 01:26:03,841
That's a good idea.

605
01:26:11,491 --> 01:26:12,656
Masha!

606
01:26:24,439 --> 01:26:25,851
How quiet it is, Galtsev.

607
01:26:26,861 --> 01:26:28,322
Isn't it, Masha?

608
01:26:30,870 --> 01:26:32,581
It's so quiet.

609
01:26:35,757 --> 01:26:37,004
The war...

610
01:27:01,067 --> 01:27:02,183
Brothers!

611
01:27:02,403 --> 01:27:04,445
Victory!

612
01:27:21,323 --> 01:27:23,365
IMPERIAL CHANCELLERY

613
01:27:36,316 --> 01:27:39,321
I can take you there.

614
01:27:39,532 --> 01:27:42,703
- Is it far from here?
- No, it's not far.

615
01:27:44,419 --> 01:27:47,293
Come closer.

616
01:27:48,303 --> 01:27:50,013
Can you identify these bodies?

617
01:27:50,224 --> 01:27:51,471
He says he can.

618
01:27:52,062 --> 01:27:54,603
It's Goebbels,
his wife and daughters.

619
01:27:58,494 --> 01:28:02,627
He poisoned his family
with potassium cyanide

620
01:28:03,422 --> 01:28:05,833
and ordered his body to be soaked
with petrol...

621
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:07,926
and burned.

622
01:28:20,963 --> 01:28:23,006
He can show you the place.

623
01:28:31,029 --> 01:28:35,114
At night he murdered his wife,
children, and himself...

624
01:28:36,249 --> 01:28:37,496
I see. Let's go.

625
01:29:06,278 --> 01:29:09,616
Won't this be the last war on earth?

626
01:29:12,042 --> 01:29:14,168
You're too nervous, Galtsev.

627
01:29:15,926 --> 01:29:18,931
See a doctor about your nerves.

628
01:29:19,226 --> 01:29:23,644
But, Kholin, wait...
You were killed.

629
01:29:24,446 --> 01:29:26,406
And I'm alive.

630
01:29:27,495 --> 01:29:29,537
I must not forget it.
