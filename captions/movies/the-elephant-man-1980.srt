1
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:51,733
Darling, don't be difficult.
Let's take our sweet...

2
00:05:51,858 --> 00:05:55,108
lovely children on an outing.

3
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:10,149
You can't do this.
I know my rights.

4
00:06:10,233 --> 00:06:12,858
I have the authority to close
you down, and I'm doing just that.

5
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:17,441
This exhibit degrades everybody who
sees it and the creature himself.

6
00:06:17,524 --> 00:06:20,774
He is a freak!
How else will he live?

7
00:06:20,858 --> 00:06:24,108
Freaks are one thing.
This is entirely different.

8
00:06:24,191 --> 00:06:27,524
This is monstrous
and should not be allowed.

9
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:31,191
These officers will see to it
you're on your way soon. Good day!

10
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:36,066
Move along please.

11
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:40,733
Hold it there, sir.

12
00:06:40,816 --> 00:06:42,816
Come this way.

13
00:06:54,524 --> 00:06:56,441
On the move again...

14
00:07:01,524 --> 00:07:02,941
my treasure.

15
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:43,524
We'll be seeing a lot more
of these machine accidents...

16
00:07:43,566 --> 00:07:45,358
- Mr. Hodges.
- Yes, sir.

17
00:07:49,608 --> 00:07:53,941
Abominable things, these machines.
You can't reason with them.

18
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:57,024
What a mess!

19
00:08:00,774 --> 00:08:03,399
Pull on the rope.

20
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:06,358
Irons, please.

21
00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:21,691
Who is it?

22
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:26,191
- Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
- Yes, what is it?

23
00:08:26,274 --> 00:08:30,191
- I found it.
- Good. Did you see it?

24
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:36,733
All right. I'll see you
in a moment. Thank you.

25
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:41,816
Who's that?

26
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:45,274
- A friend of mine.
- Oh, yes.

27
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:48,691
- What are you up to?
- Nothing.

28
00:08:48,732 --> 00:08:50,899
Come on, Freddie!

29
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,357
Nothing of any importance.

30
00:09:48,316 --> 00:09:50,732
Can you tell me
where Cleeves Street is?

31
00:09:50,816 --> 00:09:54,232
'Round back, to the left,
then to the right. Straight through.

32
00:09:54,316 --> 00:09:55,732
Thank you.

33
00:11:14,024 --> 00:11:15,941
Are you the proprietor?

34
00:11:16,024 --> 00:11:18,607
And who might you be, sir?

35
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:21,649
Just one of the curious.
I'd like to see it.

36
00:11:24,482 --> 00:11:27,857
I don't think so.
No, sir, we're...

37
00:11:29,566 --> 00:11:31,149
closed.

38
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:34,149
Now, I'd pay handsomely
for a private showing.

39
00:11:34,191 --> 00:11:36,149
Are you the proprietor?

40
00:11:36,191 --> 00:11:38,191
Handsomely?
Who sent you?

41
00:11:38,274 --> 00:11:40,899
- I beg your pardon?
- Never mind.

42
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,607
I'm the owner.

43
00:13:08,857 --> 00:13:10,274
Life...

44
00:13:13,565 --> 00:13:16,024
is full of surprises.

45
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:23,232
Consider the fate...

46
00:13:23,315 --> 00:13:26,107
of this creature's poor mother...

47
00:13:27,857 --> 00:13:30,399
struck down...

48
00:13:30,482 --> 00:13:33,524
in the fourth month
of her maternal condition...

49
00:13:33,607 --> 00:13:37,024
by an elephant,
a wild elephant.

50
00:13:37,065 --> 00:13:39,024
Struck down...

51
00:13:40,315 --> 00:13:44,815
on an uncharted African isle.

52
00:13:45,982 --> 00:13:47,565
The result...

53
00:13:49,565 --> 00:13:51,607
is plain to see.

54
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:56,107
Ladies and gentlemen...

55
00:13:57,357 --> 00:13:59,482
the terrible...

56
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:04,232
Elephant Man!

57
00:14:18,565 --> 00:14:20,857
- Stand up.
- Stand up!

58
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,857
Turn around.

59
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,690
Turn around! Turn around!

60
00:15:13,732 --> 00:15:15,732
Yes...

61
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:18,607
you'll bring him to me
tomorrow morning at 10:00, Mr... .

62
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,482
Bytes.

63
00:15:20,565 --> 00:15:22,982
He'll be there.

64
00:15:23,024 --> 00:15:24,482
Good.

65
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:30,440
Here's my card,
and I'll send a cab.

66
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:31,982
All right?

67
00:15:32,024 --> 00:15:34,524
We have a deal.

68
00:15:36,524 --> 00:15:39,357
We understand each other.

69
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:43,940
More than money has changed hands.

70
00:15:44,024 --> 00:15:47,190
We understand each other
completely, my friend.

71
00:15:47,273 --> 00:15:49,565
Yes, well, thank you, Mr. Bytes.

72
00:15:51,107 --> 00:15:52,523
Tomorrow.

73
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,648
Cor! What a stink!

74
00:16:32,898 --> 00:16:35,398
I'm looking
for Mr. Frederick Treves...

75
00:16:35,482 --> 00:16:37,357
please, ma'am.

76
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,648
Very well.
I'll-I'll send for him.

77
00:16:41,732 --> 00:16:45,857
Nurse...
Oh, Mr. Treves, sir, this...

78
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,523
- This...
- Yes. Thank you.

79
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,607
Yes, I was expecting him.

80
00:16:51,898 --> 00:16:54,440
- Yes, are you the cab driver?
- Yes, sir.

81
00:16:54,523 --> 00:16:58,065
- Anyone else with you?
- No, sir. Just this gentleman.

82
00:16:58,148 --> 00:17:00,648
- Thank you for your troubles.
- Not at all, sir.

83
00:17:00,732 --> 00:17:02,190
My pleasure.

84
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,690
Thank you.

85
00:17:05,857 --> 00:17:08,482
Will you come this way, please?

86
00:17:09,898 --> 00:17:13,273
Mrs. Mothershead, I'll be in my
room, and I'm not to be disturbed.

87
00:17:13,357 --> 00:17:15,940
- All right?
- Of course, sir.

88
00:17:19,023 --> 00:17:22,023
Will you come with me, please?

89
00:17:24,023 --> 00:17:25,982
You heard what the doctor said!

90
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,523
Go on.

91
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,357
My name is Frederick Treves...

92
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,648
and I'm a surgeon here
at the London Hospital.

93
00:18:17,732 --> 00:18:19,148
And...

94
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:25,023
I lecture in anatomy
at the medical college.

95
00:18:29,315 --> 00:18:32,648
I'd like very much
to examine you so that...

96
00:18:34,482 --> 00:18:37,357
Would that be all right?

97
00:18:38,482 --> 00:18:40,190
Please.

98
00:18:44,898 --> 00:18:47,023
First I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

99
00:18:48,023 --> 00:18:50,273
Would that be all right?

100
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:55,357
Your owner tells me... I mean the man
who looks after you tells me...

101
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,357
that you're English
and your name is John Merrick.

102
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:04,523
John Merrick.
Is that right?

103
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:12,440
I tell you what.
I think I'll ask you a question...

104
00:19:12,523 --> 00:19:15,940
and you shake your head
like this for "no."

105
00:19:18,773 --> 00:19:20,981
Have you always been
the way you are now?

106
00:19:22,815 --> 00:19:24,856
Are you in any pain?

107
00:19:27,856 --> 00:19:30,106
Are your parents still alive?

108
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,523
Do you understand me?

109
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:35,898
Your father and your mother,
are they dead?

110
00:19:37,648 --> 00:19:39,648
Freddie, what are you doing for...

111
00:19:39,731 --> 00:19:43,856
Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry.
I had no idea you had...

112
00:19:45,981 --> 00:19:47,940
Freddie, what the hell
have you got in there?

113
00:19:48,023 --> 00:19:50,356
You'll know soon enough,
at the meeting of the Society.

114
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:53,273
Until then, I beg of you
not a word to anyone, please.

115
00:19:53,356 --> 00:19:56,648
All right, if you insist. But you
must have quite a find in there.

116
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:00,398
- I don't know what I've got.
- Nothing of any importance, eh?

117
00:20:01,481 --> 00:20:05,023
Not a word, please, Fox.
Not a word.

118
00:20:08,315 --> 00:20:09,731
All right.

119
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,148
Thank you.

120
00:20:45,981 --> 00:20:47,565
It's all right.

121
00:21:00,065 --> 00:21:02,023
I think I'll examine you now.

122
00:21:03,398 --> 00:21:06,398
I'll leave the questions
till later.

123
00:21:06,481 --> 00:21:07,940
All right?

124
00:21:09,023 --> 00:21:12,148
Will you take
your hat off now, please?

125
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:15,690
Don't be frightened.

126
00:21:15,773 --> 00:21:18,148
I simply want to look at you.

127
00:21:18,856 --> 00:21:22,731
Take your hat off.
Don't be frightened.

128
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,315
Thank you.

129
00:21:35,356 --> 00:21:36,898
Good afternoon.

130
00:21:37,981 --> 00:21:39,898
Mr. Thomas, Mr. Rogers.

131
00:21:46,398 --> 00:21:48,731
Pull the curtains aside.

132
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,440
He is English...

133
00:21:57,523 --> 00:22:00,690
he is 2 1 years of age...

134
00:22:00,731 --> 00:22:03,190
and his name is John Merrick.

135
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,815
Gentlemen, in the course of
my profession I have come upon...

136
00:22:07,898 --> 00:22:12,106
many lamentable deformities of
the face due to injury or disease...

137
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,648
as well as mutilations...

138
00:22:13,731 --> 00:22:17,148
and contortions of the body
depending upon like causes.

139
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,398
But at no time have I met
with such...

140
00:22:19,481 --> 00:22:22,356
a perverted or degraded version
of a human being as this man.

141
00:22:22,398 --> 00:22:26,523
I draw your attention to the
insidious conditions affecting him.

142
00:22:26,606 --> 00:22:28,981
- Can you see over there?
- Yes.

143
00:22:29,023 --> 00:22:32,273
Note, if you will, the
extreme enlargement of the skull...

144
00:22:32,356 --> 00:22:35,856
right upper limb,
which is totally useless...

145
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,440
the alarming curvature
of the spine.

146
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,690
- Would you turn around, please?
- Turn around, please.

147
00:22:44,856 --> 00:22:46,731
The looseness of the skin...

148
00:22:46,856 --> 00:22:52,314
and the varying fibrous tumors
that cover 90% of the body.

149
00:22:52,398 --> 00:22:54,856
And there is every indication that
these afflictions have been...

150
00:22:54,939 --> 00:22:59,398
in existence and have
progressed rapidly since birth.

151
00:22:59,481 --> 00:23:02,148
The patient also suffers
from chronic bronchitis.

152
00:23:02,189 --> 00:23:04,189
As an interesting side note...

153
00:23:04,273 --> 00:23:06,314
in spite of the
aforementioned anomalies...

154
00:23:06,356 --> 00:23:11,523
the patient's genitals remain
entirely intact and unaffected.

155
00:23:11,564 --> 00:23:13,189
Thank you.

156
00:23:16,106 --> 00:23:19,314
And his left arm is perfectly
normal, as you see.

157
00:23:21,689 --> 00:23:24,648
So then, gentlemen, owing
to this series of conditions...

158
00:23:24,731 --> 00:23:27,981
the congenital skull exostosis,
extensive papillomatous growth...

159
00:23:28,023 --> 00:23:30,481
large pendulous masses
in connection with the skin...

160
00:23:30,523 --> 00:23:32,731
the great enlargement
of the right upper limb...

161
00:23:32,814 --> 00:23:35,939
involving all the bones, the massive
distortion of the head...

162
00:23:36,023 --> 00:23:40,439
and the extensive area
covered by papillomatous growth...

163
00:23:40,523 --> 00:23:43,856
the patient has been called
the Elephant Man.

164
00:23:43,939 --> 00:23:45,356
Thank you.

165
00:24:13,398 --> 00:24:16,023
You never mentioned
his mental state.

166
00:24:17,273 --> 00:24:19,731
Oh, he's an imbecile,
probably from birth.

167
00:24:19,856 --> 00:24:21,731
The man's a complete idiot.

168
00:24:22,898 --> 00:24:24,856
I pray to God he's an idiot.

169
00:24:35,856 --> 00:24:37,814
Where have you been?

170
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:09,689
Out.

171
00:25:11,648 --> 00:25:14,106
How can I eat
with a noise like that?

172
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,648
Bytes, don't!

173
00:25:27,689 --> 00:25:30,939
Where have you been?
What did you do?

174
00:25:36,106 --> 00:25:38,981
- Our man is sick. Come right away.
- What is it?

175
00:25:39,023 --> 00:25:41,231
Like this.

176
00:25:43,189 --> 00:25:46,314
What did you do with him?
He's been like this all night.

177
00:25:48,398 --> 00:25:52,064
He was fine when he left here.
Now look at him.

178
00:25:52,148 --> 00:25:53,856
Yes, I intend to.

179
00:25:55,648 --> 00:25:57,564
- What happened?
- He fell!

180
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:00,148
He falls.

181
00:26:09,023 --> 00:26:10,939
Looks like he's had
a very severe fall.

182
00:26:12,439 --> 00:26:15,189
He's a clumsy soul.

183
00:26:16,272 --> 00:26:18,189
Never looks where he's going.

184
00:26:18,272 --> 00:26:22,522
But that's all right.
He has me to take care of him.

185
00:26:22,606 --> 00:26:25,356
Why is he sitting up like this?
He needs rest.

186
00:26:26,522 --> 00:26:28,689
Well, that's how he sleeps.

187
00:26:28,731 --> 00:26:32,647
If he lies down,
he'll kill himself.

188
00:26:32,689 --> 00:26:36,106
His head's too big.

189
00:26:36,189 --> 00:26:39,981
All right. This man
belongs in a hospital.

190
00:26:41,022 --> 00:26:42,939
Can't you treat him here?

191
00:26:43,022 --> 00:26:45,522
Listen, he's my livelihood.

192
00:26:45,606 --> 00:26:48,856
We're business partners,
he and I.

193
00:26:52,064 --> 00:26:54,064
He's the greatest freak
in the world.

194
00:26:54,147 --> 00:26:58,356
Yes, now you listen. You won't have
much of a livelihood if he dies.

195
00:26:58,397 --> 00:27:01,356
Now, stop wasting my time.
I'm going to fetch a cab.

196
00:27:01,397 --> 00:27:04,272
I truly, truly appreciate this,
my friend.

197
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:07,939
Listen. There are a lot of things
I could do for you.

198
00:27:09,022 --> 00:27:13,897
You see, I move in the proper
circles for this type of thing.

199
00:27:14,981 --> 00:27:18,356
In fact, anything at all...

200
00:27:18,397 --> 00:27:20,481
if you take my meaning.

201
00:27:21,939 --> 00:27:23,856
Everything will be taken care of.

202
00:27:23,939 --> 00:27:25,856
It's good to do business with you.

203
00:27:48,897 --> 00:27:50,856
Here we go.

204
00:28:14,856 --> 00:28:17,064
All right.

205
00:29:11,522 --> 00:29:13,481
Can I have a bowl
of oatmeal, please?

206
00:29:13,522 --> 00:29:15,314
Yes, sir.

207
00:29:15,356 --> 00:29:18,189
Breakfasting with the patients
this morning, Mr. Treves?

208
00:29:18,272 --> 00:29:20,314
Yes. No, it's for a patient.

209
00:29:20,397 --> 00:29:22,439
There you are, sir.

210
00:29:23,689 --> 00:29:25,314
Thank you. Morning.

211
00:29:25,356 --> 00:29:26,689
Morning.

212
00:29:30,814 --> 00:29:33,731
Oh, Treves! Just come here
for a moment, will you?

213
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,397
What's that?

214
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:50,564
Good heavens! You haven't acquired
a sudden taste for this, have you?

215
00:29:50,647 --> 00:29:53,647
- Yes, sir. It's quite nutritious.
- Possibly.

216
00:29:53,689 --> 00:29:55,980
Not quite the diet
for a grown man.

217
00:29:56,022 --> 00:29:57,480
Nurse!

218
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,397
When you have a moment...

219
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,189
take this up to the patient
in the isolation ward, will you?

220
00:30:05,272 --> 00:30:06,980
Yes, sir.

221
00:30:08,647 --> 00:30:11,397
Don't be frightened.
He won't hurt you.

222
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:14,939
Won't he indeed!
Just a minute, Treves.

223
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:17,272
Something I want to say to you.
Come in.

224
00:30:20,189 --> 00:30:23,730
A hospital's no place for secrecy,
you know, Mr. Treves.

225
00:30:23,814 --> 00:30:28,022
Doctors spiriting hooded figures
about is apt to cause comment.

226
00:30:28,064 --> 00:30:30,314
Why wasn't this patient
properly admitted?

227
00:30:30,355 --> 00:30:33,980
Why is he in the isolation ward?
He's not contagious, is he?

228
00:30:34,022 --> 00:30:38,230
No, sir. He's got chronic bronchitis
and he's been badly beaten.

229
00:30:38,314 --> 00:30:40,272
Why isn't he
in the general ward then?

230
00:30:41,189 --> 00:30:44,022
Well, sir, he's quite
seriously deformed...

231
00:30:44,105 --> 00:30:47,355
and I fear the other patients
would find him rather shocking.

232
00:30:47,439 --> 00:30:50,189
Deformed? Is that it?

233
00:30:50,272 --> 00:30:53,397
Am I to assume then
that he is ultimately incurable?

234
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,397
Yes, sir.

235
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,564
But you must be aware that this
hospital doesn't accept incurables.

236
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,564
The rules are perfectly clear.

237
00:30:59,647 --> 00:31:01,564
Yes, sir,
I'm well aware of that...

238
00:31:01,647 --> 00:31:04,480
but this case
is quite exceptional.

239
00:31:25,355 --> 00:31:28,897
I quite appreciate your problem,
Mr. Treves.

240
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:33,355
Why not contact the British Home or
the Royal Hospital for Incurables?

241
00:31:33,439 --> 00:31:35,355
They might find a place for him.

242
00:31:35,439 --> 00:31:38,022
I'll look into it.
Would you like to meet him?

243
00:31:55,355 --> 00:31:57,314
Excuse me.

244
00:31:58,022 --> 00:31:59,522
The Elephant Man.

245
00:32:06,189 --> 00:32:07,647
Sorry.

246
00:32:14,522 --> 00:32:17,355
I should have warned you.

247
00:32:17,439 --> 00:32:19,355
Please forgive me.

248
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:22,564
- You all right?
- Yes, sir.

249
00:32:24,022 --> 00:32:26,980
Please ask Mrs. Mothershead
to come up here.

250
00:32:27,022 --> 00:32:30,439
Tell her to knock on the door
and wait for me.

251
00:32:41,689 --> 00:32:44,647
I'm sorry about that. L...

252
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:49,980
We'll bring you another breakfast.
You must be very hungry.

253
00:32:50,022 --> 00:32:54,439
And I think you'll be quite
comfortable here for a while.

254
00:32:54,522 --> 00:32:56,522
I'll see to it that you have
everything you need.

255
00:36:18,522 --> 00:36:19,730
Cor blimey!

256
00:36:25,063 --> 00:36:28,855
So, this is the Elephant Man.

257
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:32,897
I ain't seen nothing
like you before.

258
00:36:35,188 --> 00:36:37,813
What the bleedin' hell
happened to ya?

259
00:36:42,355 --> 00:36:44,021
Dumb, eh?

260
00:36:45,688 --> 00:36:48,521
I like people
that can keep quiet.

261
00:36:51,896 --> 00:36:54,688
Here, have a drink.

262
00:36:57,355 --> 00:36:59,688
Go on! No?

263
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:06,855
You should be more sociable, mate.

264
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:11,271
You'll get yourself disliked.

265
00:37:16,521 --> 00:37:19,896
You and I are
gonna be good friends...

266
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,230
and I've got a lot of friends
who'd like to meet you.

267
00:37:22,313 --> 00:37:24,396
And they will, mate.

268
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,355
Believe me, they will.

269
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,855
I've brought your breakfast.
What are you doing down there?

270
00:37:41,896 --> 00:37:44,021
Come on, up on the bed.

271
00:38:20,855 --> 00:38:23,396
All he understands
is a good smack.

272
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,105
He's had his share of smacks. That's
what drives him under the bed.

273
00:38:27,188 --> 00:38:29,896
You have to treat him
with kindness and patience.

274
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:33,646
Perhaps you've got time for that
sort of treatment, Mr. Treves.

275
00:38:33,688 --> 00:38:36,688
But I haven't.
I've got a hospital to run.

276
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:38,896
Now, don't you waste your time
with him, sir.

277
00:38:40,355 --> 00:38:43,813
It's like talking to a brick wall.

278
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:48,230
Now, I don't mean to be harsh but...

279
00:38:48,313 --> 00:38:50,271
he doesn't belong here.

280
00:38:52,188 --> 00:38:57,271
Honestly, sir, honestly,
what can you do for him?

281
00:39:09,646 --> 00:39:13,355
Oh, and by the way,
Mr. Carr Gomm said...

282
00:39:13,396 --> 00:39:16,355
he would like to see you
when you can spare a moment.

283
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:18,105
- Yes.
- Right.

284
00:39:24,188 --> 00:39:26,438
I can't help you
unless you help me.

285
00:39:35,438 --> 00:39:39,146
You see, I believe there's something
that you want to say to me.

286
00:39:39,188 --> 00:39:41,896
Something back there.

287
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,480
I can't help you unless
you help me, you know!

288
00:39:47,771 --> 00:39:50,688
I believe you want to say something
to me, don't you?

289
00:39:52,355 --> 00:39:55,688
I've got to understand what you're
feeling, what you're thinking.

290
00:39:57,396 --> 00:39:59,480
Do you understand me?

291
00:40:02,646 --> 00:40:06,355
All right, just nod your head
if you can... Can you understand me?

292
00:40:06,396 --> 00:40:09,146
Just nod your head
if you understand me.

293
00:40:13,896 --> 00:40:15,438
All right.

294
00:40:17,313 --> 00:40:19,646
You do understand.

295
00:40:19,688 --> 00:40:22,229
I want to hear...
I want to hear you talk.

296
00:40:22,313 --> 00:40:25,146
We're gonna show them that
you're not a wall. Understand?

297
00:40:25,188 --> 00:40:27,979
I want you to talk to me.

298
00:40:28,021 --> 00:40:31,979
All right, now,
I want to hear you say it.

299
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:34,604
I've got to hear how
you say things.

300
00:40:34,688 --> 00:40:39,104
I won't hurt you. I've got to hear
and understand how you say things.

301
00:40:39,188 --> 00:40:42,563
Very slowly,
I want you to say, "Yes."

302
00:40:44,688 --> 00:40:45,938
Say, "Yes."

303
00:40:51,271 --> 00:40:53,146
Yes.

304
00:40:54,229 --> 00:40:55,729
Yes!

305
00:40:55,813 --> 00:40:57,229
Good.

306
00:40:57,979 --> 00:41:01,354
All right, now, just once more
say it again. "Yes."

307
00:41:06,188 --> 00:41:08,813
Yes, I can understand that.

308
00:41:08,896 --> 00:41:10,354
That's good.

309
00:41:11,521 --> 00:41:13,521
That's very good.
All right now.

310
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:16,604
I'm going to say some words to you,
and I want you to repeat them.

311
00:41:16,688 --> 00:41:18,896
Do you understand?

312
00:41:18,979 --> 00:41:21,354
Say, "Hello.

313
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:23,188
My name is..."

314
00:41:27,813 --> 00:41:29,229
Hello.

315
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:33,271
My name is...

316
00:41:33,354 --> 00:41:35,979
"John Merrick."

317
00:41:38,688 --> 00:41:41,938
No. John... That's very good.

318
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:44,188
Say, "John Merrick."

319
00:41:48,688 --> 00:41:52,813
"Hello. My name is John Merrick."

320
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:56,271
Hello.

321
00:41:56,354 --> 00:41:59,688
My name is...

322
00:41:59,771 --> 00:42:02,396
John Merrick.

323
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:03,813
You can speak.

324
00:42:12,479 --> 00:42:14,479
How did you get up here?

325
00:42:15,979 --> 00:42:17,938
I want my man back.

326
00:42:18,021 --> 00:42:22,646
- Just a moment. How did you get up?
- Never mind that. I want my man.

327
00:42:22,688 --> 00:42:24,646
He's still very sick.

328
00:42:24,688 --> 00:42:27,104
Please, come downstairs with me,
and I'll explain the situation.

329
00:42:27,188 --> 00:42:28,813
Don't!

330
00:42:30,188 --> 00:42:32,313
Don't.

331
00:42:32,354 --> 00:42:36,396
You've had plenty of time to...

332
00:42:36,479 --> 00:42:38,646
cure him.

333
00:42:38,688 --> 00:42:41,396
And now he's leaving with me.

334
00:42:41,479 --> 00:42:46,688
Do you understand me now,
Mr. Treves?

335
00:42:46,771 --> 00:42:48,521
We made a deal.

336
00:42:48,563 --> 00:42:50,354
You misunderstood.

337
00:42:50,438 --> 00:42:55,063
This man has suffered a severe fall,
if you take my meaning.

338
00:42:55,146 --> 00:42:56,938
He's my patient now.

339
00:42:57,021 --> 00:42:59,021
Pull the other one,
why don't you?

340
00:42:59,104 --> 00:43:01,021
Mr. Bytes, I'm sorry.

341
00:43:01,104 --> 00:43:03,563
But all you do is profit
from another man's misery.

342
00:43:05,688 --> 00:43:07,646
Do you think
you're better than me?

343
00:43:07,729 --> 00:43:09,688
No, I never said that.

344
00:43:09,729 --> 00:43:13,313
You wanted the freak...

345
00:43:13,396 --> 00:43:16,854
to show to those doctor chums of
yours, to make a name for yourself.

346
00:43:16,938 --> 00:43:18,896
You, my friend.

347
00:43:20,479 --> 00:43:25,563
I gave you the freak on trust...

348
00:43:25,646 --> 00:43:28,688
in the name of science...

349
00:43:28,771 --> 00:43:30,729
and now I want him back!

350
00:43:30,854 --> 00:43:32,854
You do not own this man!
Now stop it!

351
00:43:33,771 --> 00:43:35,563
I want him back!

352
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,688
So you can beat him?
So you can starve him?

353
00:43:37,771 --> 00:43:40,146
A dog in the streets
would fare better with you!

354
00:43:40,188 --> 00:43:42,354
I shall go to the authorities.

355
00:43:42,354 --> 00:43:45,729
Go to the authorities then!
Go to them by all means.

356
00:43:45,854 --> 00:43:49,187
They'll be very interested
to hear your story as well as ours.

357
00:43:50,937 --> 00:43:52,979
Now...

358
00:43:53,062 --> 00:43:57,521
I think we really do understand
one another.

359
00:44:00,562 --> 00:44:02,021
All right.

360
00:44:16,979 --> 00:44:20,187
Singularly unattractive character,
I must say.

361
00:44:22,021 --> 00:44:26,104
Well, Treves, it seems to me I might
as well meet this patient of yours.

362
00:44:26,187 --> 00:44:29,562
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

363
00:44:32,437 --> 00:44:34,562
Shall we say in a few days then?

364
00:44:34,646 --> 00:44:36,896
Shall we say 2:00
tomorrow afternoon?

365
00:44:40,521 --> 00:44:43,812
Yes. Well, whatever's
most convenient for you, sir.

366
00:44:43,854 --> 00:44:46,271
2:00 then, tomorrow.

367
00:44:46,354 --> 00:44:48,354
Thank you very much.

368
00:44:52,687 --> 00:44:54,104
2:00!

369
00:44:57,979 --> 00:45:00,396
Morning, Mr. Treves.
Early again, I see.

370
00:45:00,479 --> 00:45:01,729
Yes.

371
00:45:01,854 --> 00:45:04,812
With these early habits of yours,
you'd have made a good milkman.

372
00:45:04,937 --> 00:45:08,604
- I'll keep that in mind, Charles.
- Okay, sir. Good morning.

373
00:45:16,687 --> 00:45:19,687
He restoreth my soul.

374
00:45:19,812 --> 00:45:24,812
He leadeth me into paths of...
for His name's sake.

375
00:45:24,896 --> 00:45:28,271
Righteousness. Righteousness.

376
00:45:29,937 --> 00:45:34,521
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness...

377
00:45:34,604 --> 00:45:37,104
for His name's sake.

378
00:45:37,187 --> 00:45:40,229
Good. That's very good. Good.

379
00:45:40,354 --> 00:45:44,687
When your visitor comes today, say
it exactly the way you've said it.

380
00:45:44,729 --> 00:45:49,479
So when I introduce him to you,
say the words that you've learned.

381
00:45:49,521 --> 00:45:53,312
If you have trouble with any words,
I'll help you, so don't worry.

382
00:45:53,354 --> 00:45:55,854
I will introduce him to you
and say...

383
00:45:55,937 --> 00:45:58,354
"Please meet Mr. Carr Gomm."

384
00:45:58,396 --> 00:45:59,979
And you will say?

385
00:46:01,187 --> 00:46:05,812
Hello. My name is John Merrick.

386
00:46:05,854 --> 00:46:08,104
I'm very pleased to meet you.

387
00:46:09,396 --> 00:46:11,854
Good! Good.

388
00:46:11,979 --> 00:46:14,896
I'll go and get Mr. Carr Gomm.

389
00:46:20,521 --> 00:46:23,146
It is only a physical problem.

390
00:46:24,812 --> 00:46:27,562
He has trouble with certain sounds
because of...

391
00:46:27,646 --> 00:46:30,979
the constrictive deformity
of the mouth, but he can talk.

392
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:34,854
Talking's one thing, but is he able
to understand what's said to him?

393
00:46:34,937 --> 00:46:37,896
Yes. Oh, yes! Except...

394
00:46:38,021 --> 00:46:41,979
Except he's so anxious to make
a good impression on you...

395
00:46:42,062 --> 00:46:44,271
that he might seem a little nervous.

396
00:47:02,104 --> 00:47:03,562
Come in.

397
00:47:17,729 --> 00:47:18,979
John...

398
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:22,104
may I introduce you
to Mr. Carr Gomm?

399
00:47:22,187 --> 00:47:25,229
Mr. Carr Gomm,
this is John Merrick.

400
00:47:26,312 --> 00:47:29,854
Hello. My name is John Merrick.

401
00:47:29,937 --> 00:47:31,895
I'm very pleased to meet you.

402
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:34,104
I'm very pleased to meet you.

403
00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:38,687
How are you feeling today?

404
00:47:38,729 --> 00:47:41,395
I feel much better.

405
00:47:42,854 --> 00:47:44,979
Are you comfortable here?

406
00:47:47,645 --> 00:47:50,729
Everybody's been very kind.

407
00:47:51,687 --> 00:47:53,645
How is your bronchitis?

408
00:48:05,854 --> 00:48:08,354
Mr. Merrick likes the food here,
don't you?

409
00:48:12,979 --> 00:48:16,479
Much better than what
I'm used to.

410
00:48:16,562 --> 00:48:18,270
Oh, yes?

411
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:21,270
Yes. And what was that?

412
00:48:24,187 --> 00:48:25,645
Potatoes.

413
00:48:27,395 --> 00:48:29,437
I understood
that you'd been flogged.

414
00:48:32,479 --> 00:48:36,187
I feel much better now.

415
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:37,687
That's splendid.

416
00:48:37,729 --> 00:48:40,729
How do you find Mr. Treves?

417
00:48:40,812 --> 00:48:42,979
As a teacher, I mean.

418
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:53,104
Everybody's been very kind.

419
00:48:55,729 --> 00:49:00,062
How long did you and Mr. Treves
prepare for this interview?

420
00:49:06,854 --> 00:49:10,854
Everybody's been very kind.

421
00:49:10,979 --> 00:49:12,895
Yes, of course, I understand.

422
00:49:12,979 --> 00:49:15,937
Well, it's been a pleasure
meeting you, Mr. Merrick.

423
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:18,145
Good day to you.

424
00:49:27,854 --> 00:49:29,729
Very good, John.

425
00:49:29,854 --> 00:49:31,729
It was very good.

426
00:49:31,854 --> 00:49:33,729
I'll be back in a moment.

427
00:49:37,854 --> 00:49:40,687
The Lord is my shepherd...

428
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:44,062
I shall not want.

429
00:49:45,145 --> 00:49:47,062
He maketh me lie down...

430
00:49:47,145 --> 00:49:51,645
It was a brave attempt, but the man
was mouthing words taught by you.

431
00:49:51,729 --> 00:49:55,354
Yes. Well, I'm sorry
to have wasted your time.

432
00:49:55,437 --> 00:49:58,645
He restoreth my soul.

433
00:49:58,687 --> 00:50:00,479
He simply doesn't belong here.

434
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,854
He'd be better off somewhere where
he can be constantly looked after.

435
00:50:03,895 --> 00:50:06,854
I'm sorry things have turned out
this way. Good day to you.

436
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:08,354
Yea...

437
00:50:09,687 --> 00:50:13,187
though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

438
00:50:13,312 --> 00:50:15,145
I fear no evil...

439
00:50:15,187 --> 00:50:18,020
for Thou art with me.

440
00:50:18,104 --> 00:50:20,562
Thy rod and staff, they...

441
00:50:20,645 --> 00:50:22,104
Mr. Carr Gomm!

442
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:26,937
Yes, what is it?

443
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:28,729
It's that.

444
00:50:30,354 --> 00:50:33,312
I didn't teach him that part.

445
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:38,020
Surely goodness and mercy...

446
00:50:38,145 --> 00:50:41,395
will follow me all the days
of my life...

447
00:50:41,478 --> 00:50:46,478
and I'll dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

448
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,978
How did you know the rest of it?
I didn't teach you the rest of it.

449
00:50:54,062 --> 00:50:56,020
It's very strange.

450
00:50:57,270 --> 00:50:59,728
Tell me, how did you know
the rest of it?

451
00:50:59,812 --> 00:51:02,103
The 23rd Psalm.

452
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:09,978
I used to read the Bible every day.

453
00:51:11,728 --> 00:51:14,353
I know it very well...

454
00:51:14,437 --> 00:51:16,728
and the Book of Common Prayer.

455
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:22,187
The 23rd Psalm is very beautiful.
It's my favorite.

456
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:28,145
Treves, come and see me in my office
when you're through up here.

457
00:51:28,228 --> 00:51:30,187
There's something important
I want to say to you.

458
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,228
Good-bye, Mr. Merrick.
I do hope we shall meet again.

459
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:46,895
Well, why didn't you tell me
you could read?

460
00:51:49,187 --> 00:51:52,020
I was frightened.

461
00:51:53,145 --> 00:51:54,312
I see.

462
00:51:54,395 --> 00:51:59,395
I was afraid to talk.

463
00:52:02,437 --> 00:52:05,187
Please forgive me.

464
00:52:15,062 --> 00:52:18,520
Can you imagine the kind of life
he must have had?

465
00:52:18,562 --> 00:52:20,478
Yes, I think I can.

466
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,478
I don't believe so.

467
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:26,520
No one could possibly imagine it.
I don't believe any of us can!

468
00:52:37,353 --> 00:52:39,270
"Terrible though
his appearance is...

469
00:52:39,353 --> 00:52:43,437
so terrible indeed that women
and nervous persons...

470
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,895
fly in horror
from the sight of him...

471
00:52:46,978 --> 00:52:52,395
and that he is debarred from seeking
to earn his livelihood in any way...

472
00:52:52,478 --> 00:52:55,270
yet he is superior in intelligence.

473
00:52:55,353 --> 00:52:59,312
He can read and write,
he's quiet, gentle...

474
00:52:59,395 --> 00:53:03,228
not to say even refined
in his mind."

475
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:14,020
I should very much like
to meet this gentleman.

476
00:53:40,687 --> 00:53:42,728
Have you seen this?

477
00:53:49,812 --> 00:53:51,228
Listen to this.

478
00:53:51,312 --> 00:53:53,312
Hey up! Hey up!

479
00:53:58,228 --> 00:53:59,895
Now listen.

480
00:53:59,978 --> 00:54:03,603
This is a letter
to the London Times...

481
00:54:03,687 --> 00:54:05,812
from the governor of the hospital.

482
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,812
"There is now in a little room
off one of our attic wards...

483
00:54:09,853 --> 00:54:12,353
a man named John Merrick.

484
00:54:12,436 --> 00:54:14,603
So dreadful a sight
that he is unable...

485
00:54:14,686 --> 00:54:17,811
even to come out by daylight
to the garden.

486
00:54:17,853 --> 00:54:20,853
He is being called
the Elephant Man...

487
00:54:20,936 --> 00:54:23,478
on account of
his terrible deformity.

488
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:28,478
His appearance is so terrible
that women and nervous persons...

489
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:31,145
fly in terror
at the sight of him."

490
00:54:34,186 --> 00:54:36,728
And how do you get tickets
to see him?

491
00:54:36,811 --> 00:54:39,020
Your very own Sunny Jim.

492
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:41,728
- Let's go and see him then!
- All right, keep your shirt on.

493
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:44,103
The time must be right.

494
00:54:45,686 --> 00:54:47,686
Right now he's in the attic.

495
00:54:47,728 --> 00:54:53,145
But tomorrow they're moving him to
Bedstead Square right into my lap.

496
00:54:53,186 --> 00:54:56,645
Then, for the right price...

497
00:54:56,728 --> 00:55:01,811
you will see something you'll
never ever see again in your life!

498
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:53,186
Well, don't look so glum, girls.

499
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:57,103
Enthusiastic volunteers
should be more cheerful, hmm?

500
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,686
Put your collar straight, girl.

501
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:03,186
And remember...

502
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:06,270
that under no circumstances...

503
00:56:06,353 --> 00:56:07,770
whatsoever...

504
00:56:09,936 --> 00:56:12,436
are any mirrors to be brought
into this room.

505
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,478
Yes, Mrs. Mothershead.

506
00:56:15,686 --> 00:56:17,520
Yes.

507
00:56:17,603 --> 00:56:19,020
All right.

508
00:56:24,353 --> 00:56:29,145
- He's so ugly.
- Ugly or not, you're gonna help me.

509
00:56:35,145 --> 00:56:37,978
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?

510
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,478
Yes.

511
00:56:40,353 --> 00:56:43,353
You look very nice
in your new clothes.

512
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:47,145
Thank you very much.

513
00:56:47,186 --> 00:56:49,853
If there's nothing else,
I suppose we'll be leaving you now.

514
00:56:49,936 --> 00:56:51,853
No, there's nothing.

515
00:57:22,728 --> 00:57:24,686
You ready for tea?

516
00:57:26,478 --> 00:57:28,478
Please go in, John.

517
00:57:35,895 --> 00:57:37,478
Make yourself comfortable.

518
00:57:49,936 --> 00:57:51,978
Come along, meet our guest.

519
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:04,144
Mr. Merrick, I'd like you
to meet my wife, Anne.

520
00:58:04,228 --> 00:58:07,228
Anne, this is John Merrick.

521
00:58:11,186 --> 00:58:13,311
I'm very pleased to meet you,
Mr. Merrick.

522
00:58:17,686 --> 00:58:19,686
I'm...

523
00:58:19,769 --> 00:58:22,978
I'm very pleased...

524
00:58:29,144 --> 00:58:31,561
What is it?
What's the matter?

525
00:58:33,561 --> 00:58:36,144
It's just that l...

526
00:58:37,269 --> 00:58:41,311
I'm not used to being...

527
00:58:41,353 --> 00:58:45,811
treated so well by...

528
00:58:45,894 --> 00:58:47,978
a beautiful woman.

529
00:58:50,353 --> 00:58:53,353
Would you like a cup of tea,
Mr. Merrick?

530
00:58:54,394 --> 00:58:56,353
That's a good idea.

531
00:58:57,978 --> 00:59:02,353
Would you like to come and see the
rest of the house? I'll show you.

532
00:59:13,894 --> 00:59:15,853
How's your tea?

533
00:59:19,561 --> 00:59:21,186
It's very good!

534
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:28,769
I'm enjoying my visit here
very much.

535
00:59:28,853 --> 00:59:33,311
It's so kind of you to invite me
into your own home.

536
00:59:36,478 --> 00:59:39,978
I'm sorry that I...

537
00:59:40,019 --> 00:59:42,728
made a spectacle of myself.

538
00:59:42,811 --> 00:59:44,936
No, not at all.

539
00:59:49,769 --> 00:59:53,061
I like the way...

540
00:59:53,144 --> 00:59:55,728
you arranged your pictures
on the mantelpiece.

541
00:59:55,728 --> 00:59:57,186
Oh, thank you.

542
00:59:57,269 --> 01:00:00,978
Is that the way they do it
in most houses?

543
01:00:01,019 --> 01:00:04,019
Yes, I'm sure they do, yes.

544
01:00:04,103 --> 01:00:06,019
Who are they of?

545
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:11,353
These are relatives,
and these are our children.

546
01:00:11,436 --> 01:00:13,936
Children?
Oh, may I see?

547
01:00:14,019 --> 01:00:15,603
Yes, of course.

548
01:00:23,269 --> 01:00:25,686
Where are the children?

549
01:00:26,894 --> 01:00:29,978
Well, um, well,
they're out with friends...

550
01:00:30,019 --> 01:00:31,686
at the moment.

551
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:34,394
Friends.

552
01:00:34,478 --> 01:00:37,686
And here is Frederick's mother.

553
01:00:40,228 --> 01:00:42,478
Oh, how lovely.

554
01:00:42,519 --> 01:00:46,478
And these are my parents.

555
01:00:52,394 --> 01:00:54,978
They have such...

556
01:00:55,061 --> 01:00:58,061
noble faces.

557
01:00:58,144 --> 01:01:01,269
Yes, I've always...
I've always thought so myself.

558
01:01:02,936 --> 01:01:04,353
Would you...

559
01:01:07,186 --> 01:01:09,269
Would you care to see my mother?

560
01:01:10,644 --> 01:01:12,061
Your mother?

561
01:01:13,727 --> 01:01:15,477
Yes, please.

562
01:01:23,727 --> 01:01:25,311
Oh, she's...

563
01:01:27,019 --> 01:01:29,061
Mr. Merrick, she's beautiful.

564
01:01:29,144 --> 01:01:31,436
Oh, she had...

565
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:34,269
She had the face of an angel.

566
01:01:43,852 --> 01:01:45,436
I must've...

567
01:01:49,269 --> 01:01:52,811
been a great disappointment to her.

568
01:01:52,894 --> 01:01:54,477
No, Mr. Merrick.

569
01:01:56,144 --> 01:01:58,852
No son as loving as you
could ever be a disappointment.

570
01:02:01,186 --> 01:02:04,727
If only I could find her...

571
01:02:04,852 --> 01:02:07,269
so she could see me...

572
01:02:07,352 --> 01:02:11,686
with such lovely friends here now.

573
01:02:11,727 --> 01:02:13,727
Perhaps she could...

574
01:02:13,852 --> 01:02:15,727
love me as I am.

575
01:02:17,602 --> 01:02:20,436
I've tried so hard to be good.

576
01:02:28,602 --> 01:02:29,977
I'm so sorry.

577
01:02:31,936 --> 01:02:33,019
Please.

578
01:02:33,102 --> 01:02:35,102
I'm so sorry.

579
01:02:36,561 --> 01:02:38,394
Please. Here.

580
01:03:17,144 --> 01:03:19,061
What's that you're doing?

581
01:03:22,311 --> 01:03:23,894
What is it?

582
01:03:27,019 --> 01:03:30,102
I see.
It's St. Phillips.

583
01:03:30,186 --> 01:03:32,394
Why, that's very good.

584
01:03:32,477 --> 01:03:35,186
I mean, you got the windows
and arches just right.

585
01:03:50,186 --> 01:03:51,769
I wish...

586
01:03:53,936 --> 01:03:55,852
I could sleep...

587
01:03:57,436 --> 01:03:59,186
like normal people.

588
01:04:06,727 --> 01:04:10,311
- Mr. Treves?
- Yes?

589
01:04:10,394 --> 01:04:12,894
There's something that...

590
01:04:12,977 --> 01:04:15,102
I've been meaning to ask you...

591
01:04:15,186 --> 01:04:17,269
for some time now.

592
01:04:17,352 --> 01:04:18,686
What's that?

593
01:04:20,352 --> 01:04:21,811
Can you cure me?

594
01:04:26,144 --> 01:04:28,519
No, we can care for you...

595
01:04:28,561 --> 01:04:31,602
but we can't cure you.

596
01:04:36,186 --> 01:04:37,769
I thought not.

597
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:50,519
Come in.

598
01:04:52,269 --> 01:04:56,227
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

599
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:59,477
There's someone here who'd like
to meet you, if that's all right.

600
01:04:59,519 --> 01:05:02,102
May I introduce you
to one of the bright lights...

601
01:05:02,185 --> 01:05:04,394
of the English stage,
Mrs. Kendal.

602
01:05:04,477 --> 01:05:08,227
- Mrs. Kendal, Mr. John Merrick.
- Good day, Mr. Merrick.

603
01:05:10,435 --> 01:05:12,019
Good day.

604
01:05:12,102 --> 01:05:14,685
I've brought you some things.
I hope you like them.

605
01:05:14,769 --> 01:05:16,685
I hope you don't
think it too forward.

606
01:05:21,602 --> 01:05:24,144
I knew you'd understand.

607
01:05:24,185 --> 01:05:26,144
I'll leave you together.

608
01:05:28,102 --> 01:05:29,685
Here.

609
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:36,352
I want you to know, I don't go about
giving my picture to just anyone.

610
01:05:36,394 --> 01:05:38,352
Oh, no.
I wouldn't think of it.

611
01:05:40,310 --> 01:05:42,519
It's beautiful.

612
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:44,935
You're so...

613
01:05:45,019 --> 01:05:47,685
I'll... Well, I'll...

614
01:05:49,977 --> 01:05:53,810
I shall put it in a...
in a place of honor.

615
01:05:55,519 --> 01:05:58,685
Here, next to my mother.

616
01:06:04,644 --> 01:06:06,810
She's very pretty, your mother.

617
01:06:06,852 --> 01:06:08,435
Oh, yes.

618
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:25,769
I see you're constructing a...

619
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:27,435
church?

620
01:06:28,852 --> 01:06:32,602
Oh, no.
It's a cathedral.

621
01:06:32,685 --> 01:06:35,019
You see?

622
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:38,935
Only, I have to rely...

623
01:06:39,019 --> 01:06:40,602
on my imagination...

624
01:06:40,685 --> 01:06:43,394
for what I can't actually see.

625
01:06:54,935 --> 01:07:00,227
Mr. Treves tells me
that you're in the theater.

626
01:07:00,227 --> 01:07:02,310
Do you live there?

627
01:07:02,394 --> 01:07:05,185
Oh, no, Mr. Merrick.
I just work there.

628
01:07:06,519 --> 01:07:08,935
Well, it must be...

629
01:07:09,019 --> 01:07:11,852
wonderful just to work there.

630
01:07:11,935 --> 01:07:15,144
- Is it beautiful?
- You've never been?

631
01:07:15,185 --> 01:07:17,810
I'm afraid not.

632
01:07:18,519 --> 01:07:20,519
Oh, Mr. Merrick.
You must go.

633
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,810
The theater's the most
beautiful place on earth.

634
01:07:22,852 --> 01:07:24,852
Of course, I am a bit partial.

635
01:07:26,144 --> 01:07:30,227
The theater is romance.

636
01:07:31,602 --> 01:07:33,185
Romance.

637
01:07:38,227 --> 01:07:40,685
Which reminds me,
I've brought you something else.

638
01:07:47,644 --> 01:07:49,560
- Thank you.
- Have you read it?

639
01:07:50,685 --> 01:07:55,560
No, but I certainly shall.

640
01:08:03,602 --> 01:08:06,519
Romeo and Juliet.

641
01:08:06,602 --> 01:08:08,935
Yes, I've heard of this.

642
01:08:12,852 --> 01:08:17,477
"If I profane
with my unworthiest hand...

643
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:20,018
this holy shrine...

644
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:23,477
the gentle fine is this...

645
01:08:23,518 --> 01:08:26,185
My lips...

646
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:28,852
two blushing pilgrims...

647
01:08:28,935 --> 01:08:32,810
ready stand to smooth
that rough touch...

648
01:08:36,102 --> 01:08:38,018
with a tender kiss."

649
01:08:39,227 --> 01:08:43,185
"Good pilgrim,
you do wrong your hand too much...

650
01:08:43,227 --> 01:08:45,560
which mannerly devotion
shows in this.

651
01:08:45,643 --> 01:08:49,810
For saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch...

652
01:08:49,852 --> 01:08:52,185
and palm to palm
is holy Palmer's kiss."

653
01:08:54,018 --> 01:08:57,268
"O, then dear saint...

654
01:08:57,352 --> 01:09:00,310
let lips do what hands do.

655
01:09:00,352 --> 01:09:03,143
They pray, grant thou...

656
01:09:03,185 --> 01:09:07,393
lest faith turn to despair."

657
01:09:07,477 --> 01:09:09,393
"Saints do not move...

658
01:09:10,852 --> 01:09:12,852
though grant for prayer's sake."

659
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:16,852
"Then move not...

660
01:09:16,935 --> 01:09:20,560
while my prayer's effect I take.

661
01:09:21,852 --> 01:09:23,810
Thus from my lips...

662
01:09:23,852 --> 01:09:27,477
by thine, my sin is purged."

663
01:09:32,102 --> 01:09:34,685
Oh, yes.
And then it says they kiss.

664
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:41,018
"Then have my lips
the sin that they have took."

665
01:09:47,310 --> 01:09:50,352
"Sin from thy lips?

666
01:09:50,435 --> 01:09:53,185
O trespass sweetly urged.

667
01:09:54,810 --> 01:09:57,518
Give me my sin again."

668
01:10:03,602 --> 01:10:05,643
Oh, Mr. Merrick.

669
01:10:05,685 --> 01:10:07,810
You're not an elephant man at all.

670
01:10:14,185 --> 01:10:16,518
You're Romeo.

671
01:10:24,268 --> 01:10:27,768
"Mrs. Kendal, always at the
forefront of fashion and form...

672
01:10:27,852 --> 01:10:30,518
was seen leaving the London
the other afternoon.

673
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,185
No, dear readers, the most
facile actress of our day...

674
01:10:33,268 --> 01:10:37,518
has not been taken ill, but rather
said she was visiting a friend.

675
01:10:37,602 --> 01:10:40,810
And who was the lucky recipient
of this attention?

676
01:10:40,852 --> 01:10:43,977
Quick inquiries proved it to be
none other than Mr. John Merrick...

677
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:48,768
the Elephant Man, with whom our
readers are undoubtedly familiar.

678
01:10:48,852 --> 01:10:51,185
After a chat of
three quarters of an hour...

679
01:10:51,227 --> 01:10:53,477
Mrs. Kendal was kind enough
to leave Mr. Merrick...

680
01:10:53,518 --> 01:10:55,643
with an autographed portrait
of herself."

681
01:10:55,727 --> 01:10:57,685
I saw it in his room.

682
01:10:57,727 --> 01:11:01,352
"Owing to a disfigurement
of the most extreme nature...

683
01:11:01,435 --> 01:11:05,602
Mr. Merrick has never been properly
presented to London society.

684
01:11:05,685 --> 01:11:07,810
But knowing that
wherever Mrs. Kendal goes...

685
01:11:07,852 --> 01:11:12,102
others inevitably follow,
the question arises...

686
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:15,185
'Will London society
present itself to him?"'

687
01:11:15,268 --> 01:11:19,810
This walking stick is so...
is so dashing.

688
01:11:19,893 --> 01:11:23,310
Much more elegant than my old one.

689
01:11:25,477 --> 01:11:27,060
More tea?

690
01:11:32,977 --> 01:11:37,893
You see, I don't go out
as often as I would like...

691
01:11:37,977 --> 01:11:40,185
because naturally...

692
01:11:40,268 --> 01:11:43,435
some people do find
my appearance disturbing.

693
01:11:43,518 --> 01:11:47,060
If you have a chill,
I could close the window.

694
01:11:47,143 --> 01:11:49,976
No, I'm fine.
Please...

695
01:11:50,018 --> 01:11:52,685
I mean, thank you.

696
01:11:52,768 --> 01:11:54,351
Thank you.

697
01:11:55,685 --> 01:11:57,310
You see...

698
01:11:58,601 --> 01:12:00,976
people are frightened...

699
01:12:01,018 --> 01:12:03,226
by what they don't understand.

700
01:12:04,893 --> 01:12:08,435
And it is hard to understand
even for me...

701
01:12:08,518 --> 01:12:10,976
because, well, my mother...

702
01:12:12,351 --> 01:12:14,935
she was so very beautiful.

703
01:12:25,268 --> 01:12:28,185
Mrs. Mothershead, I don't think he
should have any more visitors today.

704
01:12:28,268 --> 01:12:30,518
I have to lecture at the college,
so I'll be back this evening.

705
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:31,768
Excuse me, but if you have the time,
I would like a word with you.

706
01:12:31,768 --> 01:12:33,810
Excuse me, but if you have the time,
I would like a word with you.

707
01:12:33,893 --> 01:12:37,060
- I'm awfully late. What is it?
- Well, sir, I don't quite...

708
01:12:37,143 --> 01:12:39,185
I don't quite understand...

709
01:12:39,268 --> 01:12:42,685
why it is you allow
that sort of people in there.

710
01:12:42,726 --> 01:12:45,518
Why? Because he enjoys it,
and I think it's very good for him.

711
01:12:45,601 --> 01:12:48,185
Yes, but sir, you saw
the expression on their faces.

712
01:12:48,268 --> 01:12:50,435
They didn't hide their disgust.

713
01:12:50,518 --> 01:12:52,226
They don't care
anything about John.

714
01:12:52,310 --> 01:12:54,601
They only want
to impress their friends.

715
01:12:54,685 --> 01:12:56,601
I think you're being
rather harsh on them, don't you?

716
01:12:56,685 --> 01:12:58,726
I beg your pardon, sir.

717
01:12:58,810 --> 01:13:00,768
You yourself hardly showed him
much loving kindness...

718
01:13:00,851 --> 01:13:02,810
when he first arrived, did you?

719
01:13:02,851 --> 01:13:06,685
I bathed him, I fed him and
I cleaned up after him, didn't I?

720
01:13:06,768 --> 01:13:09,310
And I see that
my nurses do the same.

721
01:13:09,393 --> 01:13:13,851
And if"loving kindness"
can be called care...

722
01:13:13,893 --> 01:13:16,726
and practical concern...

723
01:13:16,810 --> 01:13:20,101
then I did show him loving kindness
and I am not ashamed to admit it.

724
01:13:20,185 --> 01:13:23,351
I didn't mean it exactly that way.
Now, please believe me.

725
01:13:23,435 --> 01:13:25,351
Now, of course
I appreciate your concern.

726
01:13:25,435 --> 01:13:27,810
I appreciate everything that
you've done for Mr. Merrick.

727
01:13:27,851 --> 01:13:32,310
But I am the physician in charge
and I must do what is best for him.

728
01:13:32,393 --> 01:13:36,101
- Please, now, I'm also very late.
- If you ask my opinion...

729
01:13:36,185 --> 01:13:38,560
he's only being stared at
all over again.

730
01:13:39,768 --> 01:13:41,351
Thank you.

731
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:09,726
Night time.

732
01:17:00,226 --> 01:17:02,184
What's the matter, Freddie?

733
01:17:06,268 --> 01:17:08,184
I've been thinking about Mr. Bytes.

734
01:17:08,268 --> 01:17:09,976
What on earth
made you think of him?

735
01:17:10,018 --> 01:17:15,059
Well, I'm beginning to believe that
Mr. Bytes and I are very much alike.

736
01:17:15,143 --> 01:17:16,726
That's absurd.

737
01:17:19,518 --> 01:17:22,684
It seems that
I've made Mr. Merrick...

738
01:17:22,726 --> 01:17:26,726
into a curiosity all over again,
doesn't it?

739
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:30,018
Only this time in a hospital
rather than a carnival.

740
01:17:32,059 --> 01:17:34,143
My name is constantly
in the papers...

741
01:17:34,184 --> 01:17:37,226
I'm always being praised
to the skies.

742
01:17:37,309 --> 01:17:41,268
Patients are now expressly
asking for my services.

743
01:17:41,351 --> 01:17:43,809
Of course they do,
because you're a very fine doctor.

744
01:17:43,893 --> 01:17:47,059
John Merrick is happier
and more fulfilled now...

745
01:17:47,143 --> 01:17:48,643
than he's ever been
in his entire life...

746
01:17:48,726 --> 01:17:50,893
and it's completely due to you.

747
01:17:52,851 --> 01:17:56,476
What was it all for?
Why did I do it?

748
01:17:56,518 --> 01:17:58,434
Freddie, what are you trying to say?

749
01:18:03,559 --> 01:18:05,518
Am I a good man...

750
01:18:06,643 --> 01:18:08,559
or am I a bad man?

751
01:18:14,226 --> 01:18:18,101
Steady on, Treves.
Steady on, my dear fellow.

752
01:18:18,184 --> 01:18:20,101
Come sit down, won't you?

753
01:18:25,726 --> 01:18:29,101
Gentlemen, I know we usually
open these proceedings...

754
01:18:29,184 --> 01:18:31,101
by reading the minutes.

755
01:18:31,184 --> 01:18:33,684
But on this occasion,
in the interests of urgency...

756
01:18:33,768 --> 01:18:35,518
I think we should first conclude...

757
01:18:35,559 --> 01:18:38,018
the matter
previously under discussion...

758
01:18:38,059 --> 01:18:40,434
the case of Mr. John Merrick,
the Elephant Man.

759
01:18:40,517 --> 01:18:44,767
One moment, Mr. Chairman.
As far as I'm concerned...

760
01:18:44,809 --> 01:18:47,976
this creature has no business
being here at all.

761
01:18:49,184 --> 01:18:51,101
l, for one,
am sick and tired...

762
01:18:51,184 --> 01:18:54,142
of this competitive freak-hunting...

763
01:18:54,184 --> 01:18:56,851
by these overly ambitious
young doctors...

764
01:18:56,934 --> 01:18:59,184
trying to make names for themselves.

765
01:18:59,226 --> 01:19:03,017
To parade them about in front of the
pathological society is one thing...

766
01:19:03,059 --> 01:19:05,142
but to waste this committee's
valuable time...

767
01:19:05,226 --> 01:19:09,559
with requests for shelter for these
abominations of nature is another.

768
01:19:14,559 --> 01:19:17,476
You must be more careful.

769
01:19:17,517 --> 01:19:21,559
In the light of these facts,
our course is clear.

770
01:19:21,642 --> 01:19:25,017
The question is not whether to
accept this creature as a patient.

771
01:19:25,059 --> 01:19:28,559
The question is, when will
those rooms be vacated for use...

772
01:19:28,642 --> 01:19:31,809
by better qualified,
more deserving cases?

773
01:19:31,851 --> 01:19:33,559
I move that this Elephant Man...

774
01:19:33,642 --> 01:19:36,142
be removed from
the premises immediately.

775
01:19:36,184 --> 01:19:39,934
We have a sacred duty
to cure the sick...

776
01:19:40,017 --> 01:19:41,601
not care for circus animals.

777
01:19:43,017 --> 01:19:46,392
That is my last word on the subject.
Mr. Chairman, shall we vote?

778
01:19:46,476 --> 01:19:50,059
I take it, Mr. Broadneck, your mind
is quite unshakable in this matter?

779
01:19:50,142 --> 01:19:53,226
Mr. Chairman,
do you not have ears?

780
01:19:53,309 --> 01:19:55,809
I am unalterably opposed!

781
01:19:56,559 --> 01:19:58,559
My mind is made up on this!

782
01:20:00,434 --> 01:20:02,517
You shall not sway me.

783
01:20:02,601 --> 01:20:06,434
May we now vote, Mr. Chairman,
at long last?

784
01:20:07,559 --> 01:20:09,059
Yes, Broadneck.

785
01:20:09,142 --> 01:20:11,059
I think the time has come.

786
01:20:12,142 --> 01:20:15,309
Gentlemen, Her Royal Highness...

787
01:20:15,351 --> 01:20:18,601
Alexandra, Princess of Wales.

788
01:20:36,476 --> 01:20:39,267
Good morning, gentlemen.
I hope I am not disturbing you.

789
01:20:39,351 --> 01:20:41,392
On the contrary, ma'am.
Your presence here...

790
01:20:41,476 --> 01:20:44,142
is always greatly appreciated.

791
01:20:44,226 --> 01:20:47,267
We were just taking a vote
on Mr. Merrick.

792
01:20:51,351 --> 01:20:55,142
Her Royal Highness has shown
the greatest interest in his fate.

793
01:20:55,184 --> 01:20:57,559
Indeed I have, sir,
as has the queen.

794
01:21:01,017 --> 01:21:03,767
I have a brief communication
from Her Majesty...

795
01:21:03,809 --> 01:21:06,309
which she has requested
that I read to you.

796
01:21:09,267 --> 01:21:12,226
"To the Governing Committee,
London Hospital.

797
01:21:19,851 --> 01:21:24,184
I would very much like to commend
you for the charitable face...

798
01:21:24,267 --> 01:21:27,184
you have shown Mr. John Merrick,
the Elephant Man.

799
01:21:27,226 --> 01:21:29,851
It is laudable
that you have provided...

800
01:21:29,934 --> 01:21:32,309
one of England's
most unfortunate sons...

801
01:21:32,351 --> 01:21:36,976
with a safe and tranquil harbor,
a home.

802
01:21:37,059 --> 01:21:38,976
For this immeasurable kindness...

803
01:21:39,017 --> 01:21:41,392
as well as the many
other acts of mercy...

804
01:21:41,476 --> 01:21:43,392
on behalf of the poor...

805
01:21:43,476 --> 01:21:47,601
of which Mr. Carr Gomm
has kept me informed...

806
01:21:47,684 --> 01:21:50,559
I gratefully thank you.

807
01:21:50,642 --> 01:21:52,267
Signed, Victoria."

808
01:21:57,351 --> 01:22:01,726
I'm sure I can count on you
gentlemen to do the Christian thing.

809
01:22:01,809 --> 01:22:05,434
Thank you very much, ma'am.
I'm sure we shall all try.

810
01:22:06,684 --> 01:22:09,309
Gentlemen, I wish to move
that Mr. John Merrick...

811
01:22:09,392 --> 01:22:11,809
be admitted to this hospital
on a permanent basis...

812
01:22:11,892 --> 01:22:15,100
provided the hospital receives
a yearly sum...

813
01:22:15,184 --> 01:22:17,892
equal to the cost of
the occupation of one bed.

814
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,809
All those in favor?

815
01:22:32,434 --> 01:22:35,475
Thank you, gentlemen.
The motion is carried.

816
01:22:41,642 --> 01:22:44,017
Yes. Come in!

817
01:22:49,475 --> 01:22:51,059
Good afternoon.

818
01:22:52,684 --> 01:22:55,517
Mr. Carr Gomm has something
he wants to say to you.

819
01:22:55,559 --> 01:22:58,017
Mr. Merrick,
I have very great pleasure...

820
01:22:58,100 --> 01:23:00,850
in being able
to welcome you officially...

821
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:02,684
to the London Hospital.

822
01:23:02,725 --> 01:23:05,434
This morning, the governing
committee unanimously voted...

823
01:23:05,517 --> 01:23:09,642
that you should be provided with
these rooms on a permanent basis.

824
01:23:09,725 --> 01:23:11,975
This is your home now.

825
01:23:12,017 --> 01:23:14,350
I'm so very, very glad for you.

826
01:23:14,392 --> 01:23:16,725
Welcome home, lad.

827
01:23:20,934 --> 01:23:22,517
This is...

828
01:23:24,559 --> 01:23:26,017
my home?

829
01:23:26,059 --> 01:23:27,225
Yes.

830
01:23:27,309 --> 01:23:32,267
Please, will you thank
the governing committee for me?

831
01:23:32,350 --> 01:23:34,267
I will do my utmost...

832
01:23:34,350 --> 01:23:37,267
to merit their kindness.

833
01:23:37,892 --> 01:23:39,975
This...

834
01:23:40,059 --> 01:23:42,225
is my home?

835
01:23:43,309 --> 01:23:45,267
Yes. This as well.

836
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:53,934
Your dressing case.

837
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:04,684
Oh, thank you.

838
01:24:11,309 --> 01:24:13,225
Thanks, all my friends.

839
01:24:13,309 --> 01:24:15,517
Thank you.

840
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:18,809
- You like it?
- Oh, my friends.

841
01:24:24,350 --> 01:24:26,267
Oh, my friends.

842
01:24:28,809 --> 01:24:31,309
Oh, thank you.

843
01:24:55,975 --> 01:24:58,392
- Who's next?
- I say.

844
01:24:59,809 --> 01:25:02,267
- What, you again?
- Yeah, but...

845
01:25:02,350 --> 01:25:05,684
But these young ladies
have never seen it.

846
01:25:08,975 --> 01:25:10,559
You're on, mate.

847
01:25:13,184 --> 01:25:16,475
Okay, that's it
for this performance.

848
01:25:16,517 --> 01:25:19,975
- Jim, can I go tonight?
- Sit down, Charlie.

849
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:23,267
There's always tomorrow.
Don't worry.

850
01:25:26,975 --> 01:25:29,475
Room for one more?

851
01:25:29,559 --> 01:25:31,517
At the right price.

852
01:25:33,392 --> 01:25:34,892
There's room.

853
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:49,308
All right, all right!
Keep the noise down!

854
01:25:51,808 --> 01:25:54,267
We don't want
to frighten him, do we?

855
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:31,058
Hello. My name...

856
01:26:31,142 --> 01:26:35,350
is John Merrick...

857
01:26:35,433 --> 01:26:39,683
and I'm very, very pleased...

858
01:26:39,725 --> 01:26:42,183
to meet you.

859
01:26:46,308 --> 01:26:48,933
I think you are...

860
01:26:49,017 --> 01:26:52,017
very beautiful...

861
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:58,183
Curtain time!

862
01:26:58,267 --> 01:27:01,808
You look beautiful, darling.
I wouldn't change a thing.

863
01:27:02,933 --> 01:27:05,183
You look like
the bleedin' Prince of Wales.

864
01:27:07,183 --> 01:27:09,100
Here, my friends...

865
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:12,350
is the Elephant Man!

866
01:27:15,475 --> 01:27:18,892
I told you he was horrible.

867
01:27:18,975 --> 01:27:20,558
Just horrible.

868
01:27:30,017 --> 01:27:33,142
Perhaps the ladies
would like a closer look?

869
01:27:33,183 --> 01:27:36,767
- Yeah, yeah.
- No, Jack!

870
01:27:40,850 --> 01:27:42,433
There.

871
01:27:44,725 --> 01:27:47,892
He's quite a ladies' man, isn't he?

872
01:27:47,975 --> 01:27:51,975
Come on. Give the ladies' man
a little kiss, eh?

873
01:27:53,308 --> 01:27:55,517
Come on.
Give him a kiss.

874
01:28:07,517 --> 01:28:10,267
Here, here, here!
That's enough romance.

875
01:28:10,350 --> 01:28:11,933
Time for beddy-byes.

876
01:29:02,308 --> 01:29:04,225
All right, all right.
Keep the noise down.

877
01:29:04,308 --> 01:29:06,850
Now, keep it quiet.
Quiet! Hey!

878
01:29:06,933 --> 01:29:08,891
Keep it quiet.
Now, watch this.

879
01:29:53,516 --> 01:29:56,141
Okay, that's enough!
That's enough!

880
01:29:56,183 --> 01:29:58,391
That's it.
The show's over.

881
01:29:58,475 --> 01:30:00,391
I'll see you back
at the Peacock.

882
01:30:03,308 --> 01:30:05,225
Get out of here.

883
01:30:32,266 --> 01:30:33,850
Here.

884
01:30:35,016 --> 01:30:36,600
Come on.

885
01:30:39,516 --> 01:30:42,433
There you are.
That's better, isn't it?

886
01:30:45,183 --> 01:30:47,808
I've done well tonight.

887
01:30:47,891 --> 01:30:50,891
Here. Buy yourself a sweet.

888
01:31:18,183 --> 01:31:19,600
My treasure.

889
01:32:38,683 --> 01:32:41,808
- I know what happened last night.
- What?

890
01:32:50,391 --> 01:32:52,599
Dear God.

891
01:32:52,599 --> 01:32:54,308
Boy!

892
01:33:11,599 --> 01:33:15,641
Where is he?
Where's Mr. Merrick?

893
01:33:21,058 --> 01:33:23,724
Where is he?
Where's Mr. Merrick?

894
01:33:25,849 --> 01:33:28,724
- I don't know what you mean, sir.
- Don't lie to me!

895
01:33:30,141 --> 01:33:33,391
I know all about it.
You were seen.

896
01:33:33,474 --> 01:33:35,391
You're involved with Bytes,
aren't you?

897
01:33:35,474 --> 01:33:38,349
You've taken him.
Where is he?

898
01:33:38,391 --> 01:33:41,349
Now, wait a minute.
I haven't taken him anywhere.

899
01:33:41,433 --> 01:33:44,974
I don't know no Bytes.
We were just having a bit of fun.

900
01:33:45,058 --> 01:33:47,058
We never hurt him.

901
01:33:47,141 --> 01:33:49,058
You know, just having a laugh,
that's all.

902
01:33:49,141 --> 01:33:52,266
You bastard! He's gone!

903
01:33:52,349 --> 01:33:54,683
When I left him,
he was in bed safe and sound!

904
01:33:54,724 --> 01:33:58,016
You bastard!
You bastard!

905
01:33:58,099 --> 01:34:01,724
You're not listening to me!
I told you, I don't know no Bytes!

906
01:34:01,808 --> 01:34:03,599
I ain't done nothing wrong.

907
01:34:03,683 --> 01:34:07,391
People pay money to see
your monster. I collect it.

908
01:34:07,474 --> 01:34:09,641
You're the monster!
You're the freak!

909
01:34:09,683 --> 01:34:11,808
Now, get out!
You're finished!

910
01:34:11,849 --> 01:34:15,349
You don't frighten me,
you and your bleedin' Elephant Man.

911
01:34:16,891 --> 01:34:20,099
I'm glad what I done,
and you can do nothing about it.

912
01:34:20,183 --> 01:34:22,391
Only Mothershead can sack me now!

913
01:34:28,183 --> 01:34:29,808
Done.

914
01:34:46,516 --> 01:34:48,474
There's something
I'd like to tell you, Treves.

915
01:34:49,641 --> 01:34:53,474
You know, I felt as deeply
as you did about John.

916
01:34:53,516 --> 01:34:55,266
Well, now he's disappeared...

917
01:34:55,349 --> 01:34:57,558
very likely to the continent.

918
01:34:57,641 --> 01:34:59,849
There's no question
of your going after him.

919
01:34:59,933 --> 01:35:02,933
You're desperately needed here
by your patients.

920
01:35:03,016 --> 01:35:05,849
You did everything
in your power.

921
01:35:05,891 --> 01:35:07,933
Remember that, Treves.

922
01:35:08,016 --> 01:35:09,933
Everything in your power.

923
01:36:39,474 --> 01:36:41,057
Get the stool.

924
01:37:07,766 --> 01:37:09,307
Get up, you bastard.

925
01:37:35,141 --> 01:37:38,891
Look at all these
beautiful animals.

926
01:37:43,391 --> 01:37:45,849
What a lot you have.

927
01:37:57,849 --> 01:38:00,349
That sly bastard.

928
01:38:05,349 --> 01:38:08,599
He's doing this to spite me!

929
01:38:18,599 --> 01:38:21,016
You're doing this to spite me...

930
01:38:21,057 --> 01:38:23,016
and it's got to stop!

931
01:38:23,099 --> 01:38:25,557
Bytes, he's sick!

932
01:38:25,641 --> 01:38:27,557
Let him die!

933
01:38:29,682 --> 01:38:32,432
But don't think
I'm going to bury that...

934
01:38:34,849 --> 01:38:36,516
bag of flesh!

935
01:38:36,599 --> 01:38:38,182
Wrong!

936
01:38:45,307 --> 01:38:47,224
As a matter of fact...

937
01:38:53,849 --> 01:38:56,474
- Bytes, no!
- As a matter of fact...

938
01:38:56,557 --> 01:38:58,516
Bytes, stop, please!

939
01:39:44,390 --> 01:39:46,890
Bytes, please, don't!

940
01:40:53,265 --> 01:40:54,849
We've decided...

941
01:40:58,099 --> 01:41:00,015
we're gonna get you out of here.

942
01:41:00,099 --> 01:41:02,224
All right?

943
01:41:28,682 --> 01:41:30,599
Good on you, mate.
Good on you.

944
01:42:50,265 --> 01:42:51,682
Luck, my friend.

945
01:42:54,349 --> 01:42:57,599
Luck. And who needs it
more than we?

946
01:44:25,223 --> 01:44:27,307
Hey, mister.

947
01:44:28,640 --> 01:44:31,723
Mister, why is your head so big?

948
01:44:35,848 --> 01:44:37,807
Why is your head so big, mister?

949
01:44:41,098 --> 01:44:44,140
Why is your head so big?
Why won't you answer me?

950
01:44:50,515 --> 01:44:52,432
Why is your head so big, mister?

951
01:45:20,682 --> 01:45:22,640
Stop him!

952
01:46:19,848 --> 01:46:22,848
I am not an animal!

953
01:46:24,723 --> 01:46:27,640
I am not an animal!

954
01:46:30,348 --> 01:46:33,973
I am a human being!

955
01:46:39,348 --> 01:46:42,140
I am...

956
01:46:42,223 --> 01:46:44,181
a man!

957
01:46:49,223 --> 01:46:51,181
Excuse me, sir.

958
01:46:51,265 --> 01:46:53,723
Out of the way, sir.
Excuse me.

959
01:46:56,723 --> 01:47:00,015
Mr. Treves, sir!
They found him!

960
01:47:00,098 --> 01:47:02,640
I think they found John!

961
01:47:14,140 --> 01:47:15,723
Thank you.

962
01:47:23,015 --> 01:47:25,723
- Keep still, girl.
- Sorry.

963
01:47:27,265 --> 01:47:30,890
That was very nice of Mrs. Kendal
to give me this dress for tonight.

964
01:47:30,973 --> 01:47:32,556
It's so beautiful.

965
01:47:36,015 --> 01:47:38,806
Does Mrs. Kendal know
that John is dying?

966
01:47:43,181 --> 01:47:44,640
Yes, she knows.

967
01:47:59,723 --> 01:48:02,181
How do I look?

968
01:48:02,265 --> 01:48:03,890
Splendid.

969
01:48:03,973 --> 01:48:08,056
Now, you will not look out of place.
You look absolutely splendid.

970
01:48:08,140 --> 01:48:12,015
- Oh, splendid. Shall we go?
- Yes.

971
01:48:13,056 --> 01:48:14,640
Again...

972
01:48:14,681 --> 01:48:18,723
I can't tell you how sorry I am
for what happened.

973
01:48:18,806 --> 01:48:22,306
You see, I had no idea, really.

974
01:48:22,348 --> 01:48:25,140
Please, you mustn't blame yourself.

975
01:48:25,181 --> 01:48:29,806
Mr. Treves, don't worry about me...

976
01:48:29,848 --> 01:48:32,015
my friend.

977
01:48:32,098 --> 01:48:37,640
I am happy every hour of the day.

978
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:42,223
My life is full
because I know that I am loved.

979
01:48:46,056 --> 01:48:48,848
I have gained myself.

980
01:48:57,181 --> 01:49:00,848
I could not say that...

981
01:49:00,931 --> 01:49:02,973
were it not for you.

982
01:49:07,140 --> 01:49:10,515
Well, and l...

983
01:49:10,598 --> 01:49:14,473
You've done so much for me as well.

984
01:49:14,515 --> 01:49:16,140
Thank you.

985
01:49:18,473 --> 01:49:20,015
So...

986
01:49:21,181 --> 01:49:23,140
I'll fetch Mrs. Mothershead
and Nora...

987
01:49:23,181 --> 01:49:25,765
and be back in a few minutes.

988
01:49:28,181 --> 01:49:30,140
Very good, my friend.

989
01:49:34,723 --> 01:49:36,681
My friend.

990
01:52:32,348 --> 01:52:34,598
Mrs. Kendal.

991
01:52:37,514 --> 01:52:39,681
Thank you.

992
01:52:39,764 --> 01:52:41,681
Your Royal Highness...

993
01:52:41,764 --> 01:52:43,514
ladies and gentlemen...

994
01:52:43,598 --> 01:52:46,098
tonight's performance
was very special to me...

995
01:52:46,181 --> 01:52:48,681
because it was very special
to someone else.

996
01:52:48,764 --> 01:52:51,806
A man who knows the theater
and who loves the theater...

997
01:52:51,848 --> 01:52:54,806
and yet this is the very first time
he's ever been here.

998
01:52:56,514 --> 01:52:57,806
I wish to dedicate...

999
01:52:57,889 --> 01:53:00,764
The whole company wishes to dedicate
with all their hearts...

1000
01:53:00,848 --> 01:53:03,264
tonight's performance...

1001
01:53:03,348 --> 01:53:05,306
to Mr. John Merrick...

1002
01:53:05,348 --> 01:53:07,348
my very dear friend.

1003
01:53:19,723 --> 01:53:22,681
Stand up.
They want to see you.

1004
01:53:22,764 --> 01:53:25,556
Go on. It's all right.
Just stand up.

1005
01:53:25,639 --> 01:53:27,556
They want to see you.

1006
01:54:03,972 --> 01:54:07,889
I really did believe that...

1007
01:54:07,972 --> 01:54:11,597
the ogre would never
get out of the dungeon.

1008
01:54:13,389 --> 01:54:16,889
Good.
So you really enjoyed yourself?

1009
01:54:19,681 --> 01:54:21,264
It was wonderful!

1010
01:54:21,347 --> 01:54:26,139
Good. Then we must
go again some evening.

1011
01:54:26,181 --> 01:54:29,306
Oh, yes.
Oh, I hope so.

1012
01:54:29,389 --> 01:54:31,431
Yes, we will.
We will.

1013
01:54:32,972 --> 01:54:35,347
Good. I'm pleased.

1014
01:54:35,389 --> 01:54:39,222
Well, I ought to go.

1015
01:54:39,306 --> 01:54:43,597
You must get some sleep.
Good night, and sleep well.

1016
01:54:45,806 --> 01:54:49,597
- And you too, my friend.
- Yes.

1017
01:54:49,681 --> 01:54:52,139
I'm so pleased
you enjoyed yourself.

1018
01:54:52,181 --> 01:54:54,306
Good night.

1019
01:54:57,764 --> 01:54:59,347
Good night.

1020
01:56:31,639 --> 01:56:33,181
It's finished.

1021
02:00:04,430 --> 02:00:08,764
Never, oh, never
nothing will die.

1022
02:00:08,805 --> 02:00:13,139
The stream flows,
the wind blows.

1023
02:00:13,180 --> 02:00:17,139
The cloud fleets,
the heart beats.

1024
02:00:38,513 --> 02:00:40,680
Nothing will die.
