1
00:01:38,751 --> 00:01:42,342
This is the Ardèche River
in Southern France.

2
00:01:42,343 --> 00:01:45,116
Less than half of a mile from here

3
00:01:45,117 --> 00:01:51,015
three explorers set out a few days
before Christmas in 1994.

4
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:55,548
They came along this way.

5
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,371
They were seeking drafts of air
emanating from the ground -

6
00:02:00,372 --> 00:02:03,430
which would point
to the presence of caves.

7
00:02:04,936 --> 00:02:08,221
Eventually they sensed
the subtle airflow

8
00:02:08,222 --> 00:02:10,316
and began clearing away rocks,

9
00:02:10,317 --> 00:02:13,841
revealing a narrow shaft
into the cliff.

10
00:02:14,978 --> 00:02:19,309
It was so narrow that a person
could barely squeeze through it.

11
00:02:20,726 --> 00:02:23,494
They descended into the unknown.

12
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:27,765
They were about to make
one of the greatest discoveries

13
00:02:27,766 --> 00:02:30,320
in the history of human culture.

14
00:02:39,336 --> 00:02:43,641
At first, the cave did not appear
to contain anything special,

15
00:02:43,742 --> 00:02:47,113
aside from being
particularly beautiful.

16
00:02:54,868 --> 00:02:58,678
But then, deep inside,
they found this.

17
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:15,593
It would turn out
that this cave was pristine.

18
00:03:15,794 --> 00:03:20,465
It had been perfectly sealed
for tens of thousands of years.

19
00:03:22,364 --> 00:03:28,470
It contained cave paintings
dating back 32,000 years.

20
00:03:29,986 --> 00:03:33,988
In fact, they are the oldest
paintings ever discovered.

21
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,979
More than twice as old
as any other.

22
00:04:16,437 --> 00:04:20,879
In honour of its leading discoverer,
Jean-Marie Chauvet,

23
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,263
the cave now bears
the name Chauvet Cave.

24
00:04:29,332 --> 00:04:33,912
This is road in the Ardèche Gorge,
leading to the cave.

25
00:04:34,853 --> 00:04:36,444
It is early spring.

26
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,369
We've been given
an unprecedented endorsement

27
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:45,126
by the French Ministry of Culture
to film inside the cave.

28
00:04:47,335 --> 00:04:49,567
From the first day
of its discovery

29
00:04:49,568 --> 00:04:53,367
the importance of the cave
was immediately recognized

30
00:04:53,368 --> 00:04:56,383
and access was shut off categorically.

31
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,026
Only a small group of scientists
is allowed to enter.

32
00:05:03,328 --> 00:05:08,011
They are archaeologists,
art historians, palaeontologists

33
00:05:08,012 --> 00:05:10,871
and geologists among others.

34
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,397
They are here
to perform their studies

35
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,457
during a few short weeks
at the end of March

36
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,543
and the beginning of April.

37
00:05:20,744 --> 00:05:23,538
This is one of the rare times anyone

38
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:25,865
with the exception of two guards

39
00:05:25,866 --> 00:05:28,170
is allowed inside the cave.

40
00:05:40,618 --> 00:05:44,603
The cave is like a frozen flash
of a moment in time.

41
00:05:46,616 --> 00:05:51,314
The reason for its pristine condition
is this rock face.

42
00:05:51,988 --> 00:05:54,014
Some 20,000 years ago,

43
00:05:54,015 --> 00:05:57,580
it came tumbling down
in a massive rockslide,

44
00:05:57,615 --> 00:06:00,800
sealing off the original
entrance to the cave,

45
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:03,529
creating a perfect time capsule.

46
00:06:23,272 --> 00:06:27,136
A wooden walkway leads
to the entrance of the cave.

47
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,096
The narrow tunnel,
through which the discoverers crawled,

48
00:06:35,097 --> 00:06:38,994
has been widened and locked
with a massive steel door,

49
00:06:38,995 --> 00:06:41,309
like a bank vault.

50
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:46,650
Once we pass through this door

51
00:06:46,651 --> 00:06:48,802
it will be locked behind us,

52
00:06:48,803 --> 00:06:53,135
so as not to compromise
the delicate climate inside.

53
00:06:57,295 --> 00:07:00,823
For this first exploration
into the cave,

54
00:07:00,824 --> 00:07:04,958
we are using a tiny,
non-professional camera rig.

55
00:07:08,906 --> 00:07:10,925
In this narrow holding room,

56
00:07:10,926 --> 00:07:14,919
we are fitted with sterile boots
and given safety instructions.

57
00:07:20,311 --> 00:07:21,840
- We have this.
- Good.

58
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:25,364
Once you've set this on the rock,
you don't touch it.

59
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:29,258
Clottes was the first scientist
to inspect the cave

60
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:31,585
a few days after its discovery.

61
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,740
For five years,
until his retirement,

62
00:07:34,741 --> 00:07:37,820
he served as head
of the scientific team.

63
00:07:47,096 --> 00:07:50,418
Our guide leads us down
the first sloping tunnel,

64
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:54,210
which ends in a vertical drop
to the cave floor.

65
00:09:17,107 --> 00:09:21,013
Since our film crew has been
limited to a maximum of four,

66
00:09:21,014 --> 00:09:24,053
we must all perform
technical tasks.

67
00:09:25,228 --> 00:09:30,343
Our time in the cave
has been severely restricted.

68
00:09:30,806 --> 00:09:32,735
I will take one light as well.

69
00:09:33,587 --> 00:09:35,705
So it's 3.05.

70
00:09:36,321 --> 00:09:38,067
We have one hour.

71
00:09:46,188 --> 00:09:51,382
Apart from time contrictions,
we're not allowed to touch anything.

72
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:55,164
Or ever step off the
2 ft wide walkway.

73
00:09:59,758 --> 00:10:03,478
We can use only 3 flat
light pannels,

74
00:10:03,513 --> 00:10:05,759
powered by battery belts.

75
00:10:07,871 --> 00:10:13,400
When they made the passageways,
they protected the stalagmites.

76
00:10:17,148 --> 00:10:18,656
It's a nice touch.

77
00:10:20,303 --> 00:10:23,167
Moving along in a single file

78
00:10:23,168 --> 00:10:26,015
the film crew will have no
hiding places

79
00:10:26,016 --> 00:10:28,064
to get out of the shot.

80
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:36,096
The first large chamber
we come to

81
00:10:36,097 --> 00:10:39,244
is the original entrance
to the cave.

82
00:10:39,716 --> 00:10:42,955
In prehistoric times,
before the rockslide,

83
00:10:42,956 --> 00:10:46,052
daylight must have
illuminated this.

84
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:49,526
On the left,
right inside the cave,

85
00:10:49,911 --> 00:10:51,713
you could see the entrance.

86
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:54,944
The archaeological entrance.

87
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:57,224
People came into the cave, level.

88
00:10:57,058 --> 00:10:59,093
Not like us down a ladder.

89
00:10:59,094 --> 00:11:00,659
The cliff collapsed.

90
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:03,755
Then we've got
the rubble from the cliff.

91
00:11:05,195 --> 00:11:08,262
From outside you can't see it,
from the inside you can.

92
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,234
Over there you have the dots.

93
00:11:13,935 --> 00:11:15,094
The red dots.

94
00:11:16,955 --> 00:11:20,602
Those are the ones I first saw
when I came to the cave.

95
00:11:21,913 --> 00:11:24,635
Big dots made
with the palm of a hand.

96
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,183
Here we have a big
cave bear skull.

97
00:11:33,858 --> 00:11:35,616
Male, probably.

98
00:11:39,188 --> 00:11:41,308
You'll see many others.

99
00:11:45,614 --> 00:11:49,143
In this big chamber,
which is really huge,

100
00:11:49,144 --> 00:11:50,671
the biggest in the cave,

101
00:11:50,982 --> 00:11:53,950
there are no paintings,
except right at the end.

102
00:11:54,819 --> 00:12:00,644
This is probably relevant.
When the entrance was still open,

103
00:12:00,645 --> 00:12:03,039
there must have been
some light here.

104
00:12:03,404 --> 00:12:06,270
Or they would have been
painting in complete darkness.

105
00:12:16,772 --> 00:12:19,977
This is a cave bear
painted in black.

106
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:22,182
The paintings look so fresh

107
00:12:22,183 --> 00:12:25,306
that there were initial doubts
about their authenticity.

108
00:12:25,726 --> 00:12:29,664
But this picture has a layer of
calcite and concretions over it

109
00:12:30,127 --> 00:12:32,280
that takes thousands of years to grow.

110
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:37,309
This was the first proof
that it was not a forgery.

111
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:44,176
A beautiful horse here,
one of the most beautiful in the cave.

112
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:51,411
It looks like it could
have been made yesterday.

113
00:12:52,642 --> 00:12:55,797
See how fresh it looks!

114
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:07,611
Here, behind the horse,
are two mammals. Big mammals.

115
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:11,786
Here you can see
cave bear scratches.

116
00:13:11,787 --> 00:13:15,070
These scratches do not
have the same colour.

117
00:13:15,071 --> 00:13:19,058
They might have been made
5-10,000 years earlier.

118
00:13:25,335 --> 00:13:28,512
Here's one of the great
spots in the cave,

119
00:13:29,154 --> 00:13:32,096
the famous Panel of the Horses.

120
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,492
It has the size of a small recess

121
00:13:36,493 --> 00:13:41,458
and through that hole there
water comes out,

122
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:45,615
gurgling after a week of rain.

123
00:13:47,475 --> 00:13:53,382
That may explain why the animals
were painted around that hole.

124
00:13:56,028 --> 00:14:01,246
It's one of the great
works of art in the world.

125
00:14:04,646 --> 00:14:06,912
For these palaeolithic painters,

126
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:10,407
the play of light and shadows
from their torches

127
00:14:10,408 --> 00:14:13,555
could possibly have looked
something like this.

128
00:14:17,169 --> 00:14:22,361
For them the animals perhaps
appeared moving, living.

129
00:14:23,368 --> 00:14:27,853
We should note that the artist
painted this bison with 8 legs,

130
00:14:27,942 --> 00:14:32,808
suggesting movement,
almost a form of proto-cinema.

131
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,248
The walls themselves
are not flat,

132
00:14:47,584 --> 00:14:50,052
but have their own
three-dimensional dynamic,

133
00:14:50,216 --> 00:14:54,275
their own movement,
which was utilized by the artists.

134
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:01,303
In the upper left corner is
another multi-legged animal.

135
00:15:01,304 --> 00:15:06,924
The rhino to the right seems also
to have the illusion of movement.

136
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,605
Like frames in an animated film.

137
00:15:23,147 --> 00:15:29,597
The painters speak to us from
a familiar, yet distant universe.

138
00:15:30,716 --> 00:15:35,883
But what we are seeing here
is part of millions of spatial points.

139
00:15:41,268 --> 00:15:46,351
Today, scientists have mapped
every millimetre of the cave,

140
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,508
using laser scanners.

141
00:15:49,405 --> 00:15:53,352
The position of every feature
in the cave is known.

142
00:16:00,118 --> 00:16:03,334
This is the shape of the cave
in its entirety.

143
00:16:04,149 --> 00:16:08,345
From end to end,
it is about 1300 ft long.

144
00:16:10,485 --> 00:16:15,474
This map is the basis
for all scientific projects here.

145
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:26,922
We are working to create
a new understanding of the cave.

146
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:31,527
Through precision,
scientific methods.

147
00:16:31,993 --> 00:16:35,915
But that's not the main goal.

148
00:16:36,154 --> 00:16:39,092
The main goal is to create stories

149
00:16:39,281 --> 00:16:43,249
about what could have happened
in that cave in the past.

150
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:47,504
It is like you're creating
the film directory of Manhattan.

151
00:16:47,616 --> 00:16:53,922
4 million precise entries,
but do they dream or cry at night?

152
00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:57,110
What are their hopes?
What are their families?

153
00:16:57,284 --> 00:16:59,591
You will never know
from the film directory.

154
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:04,854
We'll definitely never know
because the past is lost.

155
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:08,001
We will never reconstruct the past.

156
00:17:08,134 --> 00:17:14,212
We can only create a representation
of what exists now, today.

157
00:17:14,577 --> 00:17:17,328
You're a human being,
I'm a human being.

158
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:22,519
When you come to the cave,
of course there are some things...

159
00:17:22,952 --> 00:17:24,555
I have my own background...

160
00:17:25,326 --> 00:17:26,903
What is your background?

161
00:17:27,262 --> 00:17:31,528
I used to be a circus man,
but switched to archaeology.

162
00:17:31,816 --> 00:17:34,336
Circus? Doing what?
Lion tamer?

163
00:17:34,904 --> 00:17:40,211
Well, not a lion tamer.
Mostly unit cycles and juggling.

164
00:17:41,534 --> 00:17:48,907
When I first entered the cave,
I had a chance to stay five days.

165
00:17:49,914 --> 00:17:55,952
It was so powerful.
Every night I dreamt of lions.

166
00:17:57,082 --> 00:18:00,745
Every day was the same
shock for me.

167
00:18:00,972 --> 00:18:02,461
It was an emotional shock.

168
00:18:02,857 --> 00:18:06,098
I'm a scientist,
and a human too.

169
00:18:06,715 --> 00:18:11,350
After 5 days, I decided
not to go back to the cave.

170
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:19,911
I needed time to just relax
...and to absorb it.

171
00:18:21,273 --> 00:18:25,011
You dreamt not of paintings of lions,
but of real lions?

172
00:18:25,641 --> 00:18:29,044
Both. Definitely.

173
00:18:29,998 --> 00:18:32,015
And you were afraid
in your dreams?

174
00:18:32,103 --> 00:18:35,696
I was not afraid, no,
it was more...

175
00:18:37,721 --> 00:18:43,091
A feeling of something powerful
and deep.

176
00:18:43,703 --> 00:18:48,074
A way of understanding
that was not direct.

177
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,866
Silence please.
Please don't move.

178
00:18:56,378 --> 00:18:59,075
We're going to listen to
the silence in the cave.

179
00:19:00,113 --> 00:19:03,370
And perhaps we can even
hear our own hearts beat.

180
00:22:29,642 --> 00:22:34,018
These images are memories
of long forgotten dreams.

181
00:22:35,737 --> 00:22:38,939
Is this their heartbeat
or ours?

182
00:22:41,075 --> 00:22:44,972
Will we ever be able to understand
the vision of the artists

183
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:47,861
across such an abyss of time?

184
00:22:53,033 --> 00:22:56,898
There is an aura of melodrama
in this landscape.

185
00:22:58,874 --> 00:23:01,676
It could be straight
out of a Wagner opera.

186
00:23:01,945 --> 00:23:04,789
Or a painting by
German romanticists.

187
00:23:05,757 --> 00:23:08,517
Could this be our connection
to them?

188
00:23:10,311 --> 00:23:14,015
This staging of the landscape
is an operatic event.

189
00:23:14,512 --> 00:23:17,407
It does not belong
to the romanticists alone.

190
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:22,372
Stoneage men may have had
a smilar sense of inner landscapes.

191
00:23:22,563 --> 00:23:27,460
It seems natural that there is
a cluster of palaeolithic caves

192
00:23:27,561 --> 00:23:28,740
right around here.

193
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:33,516
The Chauvet Cave is right here
at the top of this cliff.

194
00:23:33,749 --> 00:23:38,902
The cave is also associated
with this natural feature.

195
00:23:39,096 --> 00:23:41,560
This beautiful arch called Pont d'Arc.

196
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:47,534
Maybe the Pont d'Arc,
in the mythology of the people,

197
00:23:47,855 --> 00:23:50,285
was not only a landmark,

198
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:56,858
but a mark in their imagination
and their stories and mythology.

199
00:23:56,859 --> 00:24:00,571
An important way for them
to understand the world.

200
00:24:01,771 --> 00:24:06,460
But what kind of world
was it for palaeolithic people?

201
00:24:06,676 --> 00:24:12,918
35,000 years ago,
Europe was covered by glaciers.

202
00:24:13,264 --> 00:24:18,071
In this glacial Europe,
you must imagine a dry climate.

203
00:24:18,734 --> 00:24:22,809
Cold, but with sun,
that is important.

204
00:24:23,106 --> 00:24:30,192
In this place, you have to
imagine rhinos along the rivers.

205
00:24:30,193 --> 00:24:34,212
In the forest you had
megaloceros deer.

206
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:40,504
Horses, raindeer, bisons,
and antelopes.

207
00:24:40,889 --> 00:24:42,515
It was very rich.

208
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,347
The biomass in this part of Europe
was very important

209
00:24:47,448 --> 00:24:49,233
for the development of humans,

210
00:24:49,334 --> 00:24:50,739
but also for carnivores.

211
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:57,870
So imagine lions, bears,
leopards, wolfs, foxes...

212
00:24:57,971 --> 00:24:59,502
in very large numbers.

213
00:25:00,286 --> 00:25:04,169
And among all these carnivores
and predators - humans.

214
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:08,858
Does the way they set up fires
in the Chauvet Cave

215
00:25:09,044 --> 00:25:12,051
offer evidence that they cast
their own shadows

216
00:25:12,251 --> 00:25:15,419
against the paintings of horses
for example?

217
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:18,782
The fires were necessary
for looking at the paintings.

218
00:25:19,366 --> 00:25:23,175
And maybe for staging
people around them.

219
00:25:23,331 --> 00:25:28,661
With the flames and moving light
you can imagine people dancing.

220
00:25:30,953 --> 00:25:31,901
Fred Astaire!

221
00:25:32,002 --> 00:25:36,511
The image of him
dancing with his shadows

222
00:25:36,612 --> 00:25:41,743
is a very strong image
of human representation.

223
00:25:42,161 --> 00:25:47,229
A representation of
a white wall and a black shadow.

224
00:26:07,367 --> 00:26:11,601
The presence of humans in the cave
was fleeting like shadows.

225
00:26:13,511 --> 00:26:15,352
Bear skulls everywhere.

226
00:26:16,429 --> 00:26:19,096
These skulls belonged
to the cave bear.

227
00:26:19,459 --> 00:26:23,367
A species like the mammoth
and the wooly rhino

228
00:26:23,368 --> 00:26:26,792
that vanished from
the face of the earth long ago.

229
00:26:36,496 --> 00:26:40,400
Tens of thousands of years
of patient water dripping

230
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:44,631
has left a thick coating
of calcide on this skull.

231
00:26:45,231 --> 00:26:48,957
It now has the appearance
of a porcelain sculpture.

232
00:27:09,638 --> 00:27:14,921
In all this menagerie of bones,
there's not a single human specimen.

233
00:27:16,504 --> 00:27:21,152
Scientists have determined
that humans never lived in the cave.

234
00:27:21,956 --> 00:27:26,441
They used it only for painting
and possibly for ceremonies.

235
00:27:28,489 --> 00:27:32,899
Michel Philippe has studied
the bones of the Chauvet Cave.

236
00:27:33,789 --> 00:27:39,853
Caves constitute a favourable place
for the preservation of bones.

237
00:27:39,954 --> 00:27:45,971
There are many bear bones,
99 percent of the finds.

238
00:27:46,303 --> 00:27:50,531
There are also some wolves,
two skulls and several bones.

239
00:27:50,728 --> 00:27:52,730
We have a few ibexes

240
00:27:52,831 --> 00:27:55,953
with magnificent skulls
in the wet sand with calcide.

241
00:27:56,013 --> 00:27:56,954
Quite lovely.

242
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:02,184
When you shine light on it,
calcite crystals glisten.

243
00:28:03,496 --> 00:28:05,595
There are some horses as well.

244
00:28:05,815 --> 00:28:07,723
There's a cave hyena.

245
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:11,912
There's also an eagle skeleton.

246
00:28:12,252 --> 00:28:13,448
A golden eagle.

247
00:28:15,121 --> 00:28:17,891
Practically whole, but it
may be a little more recent,

248
00:28:17,892 --> 00:28:22,727
carried in by water and
wedged against the big rocks.

249
00:28:22,947 --> 00:28:26,605
So, it's bones are spread out
over ten ft in length.

250
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:29,665
Our goal is not only
to say what bones there are.

251
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:32,412
We also try to understand
if they lived there,

252
00:28:32,513 --> 00:28:35,018
if they were moved,
how they were transported.

253
00:28:35,219 --> 00:28:37,349
Did the bears bring the bones?

254
00:28:37,313 --> 00:28:39,827
There are several bones
that have been chewed on,

255
00:28:40,028 --> 00:28:43,088
so it could have been the bears
or the hyenas.

256
00:28:47,467 --> 00:28:51,461
All the scientists are lodged
in a neaby sports complex.

257
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,610
Although they all have
their special fields,

258
00:28:56,899 --> 00:28:59,645
they compare and combine
their findings.

259
00:29:01,175 --> 00:29:04,249
We were interested
in the work of these two.

260
00:29:04,755 --> 00:29:09,748
Carol and Giles, can you explain
what you are doing here?

261
00:29:10,446 --> 00:29:17,864
In the cave, we are trying to
reveal contours of underlying designs

262
00:29:18,081 --> 00:29:20,480
that are hard to follow
with the naked eye.

263
00:29:20,767 --> 00:29:23,480
Because we are not supposed
to touch the wall,

264
00:29:23,713 --> 00:29:25,385
we take a series of photos

265
00:29:25,525 --> 00:29:27,906
that we put together
in a mosaic.

266
00:29:28,649 --> 00:29:31,612
We are trying to achieve
a maximum of detail.

267
00:29:32,244 --> 00:29:36,319
Then we take a transparency
and put it on top of the photo.

268
00:29:36,378 --> 00:29:39,726
Then we trace
the underlayer of engravings.

269
00:29:40,369 --> 00:29:42,697
Later, we return to the cave.

270
00:29:42,898 --> 00:29:46,458
We check against the contours
all the designs we can see.

271
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:49,434
And all the markings
of the bears as well.

272
00:29:49,695 --> 00:29:53,060
So that we can understand
each figure and event.

273
00:29:53,829 --> 00:29:55,327
We have bear scratches,

274
00:29:55,528 --> 00:29:58,959
and a magnificent drawing
of a mammoth done by finger,

275
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,409
and other scratches
done over the mammoth.

276
00:30:01,639 --> 00:30:05,086
Their succession is important
for understanding what took place.

277
00:30:06,178 --> 00:30:09,100
On the computer
one can see three phases.

278
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:12,644
The first dates 40,000 years
back in time.

279
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:15,165
The one when the bear
scratched the walls.

280
00:30:16,617 --> 00:30:18,249
Then a second phase

281
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:21,132
with drawings stretching
over 8 ft in height.

282
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,092
Therefore made with a stick.

283
00:30:23,601 --> 00:30:25,252
Followed by the main phase

284
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:28,429
some time around 33,000
years ago or less.

285
00:30:30,707 --> 00:30:33,526
It starts with the scraping
of the wall

286
00:30:33,327 --> 00:30:35,037
to get to the wide of the rock.

287
00:30:35,148 --> 00:30:37,494
After that the first figures
were put in place.

288
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:40,957
The two rhinos attacking
one another at the bottom.

289
00:30:41,213 --> 00:30:43,222
After that came the three bulls.

290
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:47,764
Finally, it ended with
a series of horses

291
00:30:48,284 --> 00:30:49,673
going from top to bottom.

292
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:53,819
And in the final phase,
I did this very beautiful horse

293
00:30:54,155 --> 00:30:56,719
that confronts the viewers
when they arrive in the cave.

294
00:30:58,184 --> 00:31:00,186
When you do a synthesis
of the composition,

295
00:31:00,387 --> 00:31:02,608
there is a kind of dynamic,
circular movement

296
00:31:02,709 --> 00:31:04,579
going from the bottom
to the right,

297
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,484
towards the centre like a circle.

298
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,642
It obviously creates
a very strong dynamic

299
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:13,489
reinforced here by the oblique
movement of the horses.

300
00:31:14,822 --> 00:31:16,472
It's the force of the contrast,

301
00:31:16,573 --> 00:31:19,231
the fact that they've played
with the contrast

302
00:31:19,332 --> 00:31:21,055
and with the shape of the wall.

303
00:31:27,939 --> 00:31:30,782
It's like an easel.
They've used the surface,

304
00:31:30,883 --> 00:31:34,029
made use of the material,
and mixed materials

305
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:36,294
to create this very strong impression.

306
00:31:39,935 --> 00:31:42,993
By comparing all the paintings
in the cave

307
00:31:43,409 --> 00:31:46,483
it seems certain
that the horses of this panel

308
00:31:46,584 --> 00:31:48,963
were created by
one single individual.

309
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:55,497
But in the immediate vicinity
of the horses,

310
00:31:55,769 --> 00:31:59,082
there are figures with animals
overlapping with each other.

311
00:32:00,554 --> 00:32:04,324
A striking point here is that,
in cases like this,

312
00:32:04,573 --> 00:32:08,206
after carbon-dating,
there are strong indications

313
00:32:08,408 --> 00:32:10,306
that some overlapping figures

314
00:32:10,307 --> 00:32:13,748
were drawn almost
5000 years apart.

315
00:32:17,778 --> 00:32:22,925
The sequence and duration of time
is unimaginable for us today.

316
00:32:23,965 --> 00:32:27,590
We are locked in history,
and they were not.

317
00:32:31,878 --> 00:32:36,600
Despite this blurring of time,
and the anonymity of the artists,

318
00:32:36,856 --> 00:32:40,280
there's one individual
who can be singled out.

319
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:46,575
Dominique Baffier is a scholar
of palaeolithic culture.

320
00:32:47,181 --> 00:32:51,487
Here on the right,
she examines the cluster of palm prints

321
00:32:51,622 --> 00:32:54,200
with her colleague Valérie Feruglio.

322
00:33:01,242 --> 00:33:03,771
We are currently working
on this large panel

323
00:33:03,872 --> 00:33:06,524
that was covered
with positive handprints.

324
00:33:06,525 --> 00:33:08,792
Weve been able to put forward
as evidence

325
00:33:08,993 --> 00:33:11,872
the number of positions
the individual assumed,

326
00:33:11,978 --> 00:33:13,531
and his movements.

327
00:33:15,155 --> 00:33:16,820
He started by crouching,

328
00:33:16,821 --> 00:33:20,654
and then he stretched out to reach
to his highest palm prints.

329
00:33:21,447 --> 00:33:24,650
This panel is comprised of
the prints of a single man

330
00:33:25,089 --> 00:33:27,297
who must have measured
roughly 6 ft tall.

331
00:33:29,713 --> 00:33:31,059
A single human.

332
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,715
One 1.80 m tall.

333
00:33:32,963 --> 00:33:34,058
That's big.

334
00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:37,511
- Only one person?
- One person!

335
00:33:38,253 --> 00:33:40,423
A person measuring 6 ft.

336
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:44,775
You'll notice on these prints
a very significant detail.

337
00:33:45,032 --> 00:33:47,906
He has a slightly crooked little finger.

338
00:33:48,436 --> 00:33:51,878
And that's extraordinary,
because it gives a physical reality

339
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:56,503
to a prehistoric individual
who 32,000 years ago

340
00:33:56,793 --> 00:33:58,904
came to the cave before us.

341
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:05,813
Even more surprising are
traces of him deeper in the cavern.

342
00:34:06,036 --> 00:34:09,448
We'll be able to recognize him
by his crooked little finger.

343
00:34:09,712 --> 00:34:12,728
Because he printed his hand
farther in the cave.

344
00:34:12,934 --> 00:34:15,136
So we can follow
this man's path.

345
00:34:19,485 --> 00:34:21,847
Mme Baffier took us on a tour.

346
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,477
She serves as a custodian
of the cave.

347
00:34:25,628 --> 00:34:29,856
Her rules of engagament
are strict, but entirely reasonable,

348
00:34:30,057 --> 00:34:34,122
given the precious and fragile nature
of this unique place.

349
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,616
You have cave bear tracks.

350
00:34:45,004 --> 00:34:47,496
The forepaws and hindpaws.

351
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,490
These are the longest
cave bear tracks

352
00:34:50,691 --> 00:34:52,805
currently known in any cave.

353
00:35:12,753 --> 00:35:16,285
It's very sparkly,
there are crystals that glitter.

354
00:35:32,957 --> 00:35:36,487
Here at this junction
we have the panel of the panther.

355
00:35:36,779 --> 00:35:38,871
You can see the drawing
of a panther,

356
00:35:39,072 --> 00:35:43,173
which is the only one know in
palaeolothic wall painting to date.

357
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,261
Here we've arrived at a place

358
00:35:53,462 --> 00:35:56,523
where concretion growth
has been very important.

359
00:35:57,195 --> 00:35:59,300
On the ground and walls,

360
00:36:00,231 --> 00:36:03,114
you can see that rimstone
calcite ridges

361
00:36:03,115 --> 00:36:06,358
have covered everything
in sparkling formation.

362
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,050
A kind of cascade.

363
00:36:20,882 --> 00:36:22,332
With waves.

364
00:36:39,393 --> 00:36:43,387
Here you have a bear vertebra,

365
00:36:43,588 --> 00:36:46,422
which is entirely coated
in calcite,

366
00:36:46,821 --> 00:36:49,175
and held by calcite crystals.

367
00:36:57,542 --> 00:36:59,632
In front of us, on the wall

368
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:04,161
you also have an overflowing
draperylike concretion.

369
00:37:05,217 --> 00:37:07,099
And here a kind of niche

370
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,571
where you can see the traces
of ancient red paintings,

371
00:37:11,772 --> 00:37:14,589
which have been washed away
by water sievage.

372
00:37:15,454 --> 00:37:19,286
And this is where you find
extremely original images.

373
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,563
Like this insect-shaped one.

374
00:37:22,946 --> 00:37:25,289
Or this one,
shaped like a butterfly.

375
00:37:25,962 --> 00:37:27,524
Or a bird in flight...

376
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:33,830
that you also find
on this rock pendant,

377
00:37:34,031 --> 00:37:35,382
hanging from the ceiling.

378
00:37:36,109 --> 00:37:38,184
Large and very small.

379
00:37:38,692 --> 00:37:41,422
Coupled with two vertical
ochre stripes

380
00:37:41,623 --> 00:37:44,023
that follow the pendant's contours.

381
00:38:02,898 --> 00:38:06,811
Here we are in front of
the large panel of red paintings.

382
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:09,587
Also an extremely
intriguing item.

383
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:14,430
This mount of stones
didn't fall from the ceiling.

384
00:38:14,631 --> 00:38:17,826
It was prehistoric man
who brought the stones here.

385
00:38:18,257 --> 00:38:20,056
But we do not know why.

386
00:38:27,406 --> 00:38:31,291
On this panel you have
a little rhinoceros

387
00:38:31,511 --> 00:38:34,569
with a large horn
and a stripe on the abdomen.

388
00:38:35,705 --> 00:38:38,931
Also, you have
a whole series underneath

389
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,200
of positive handprints.

390
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:44,838
And over there
you can see the hand of the man

391
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:48,090
who printed his palms
in the first room of the cave.

392
00:38:48,528 --> 00:38:52,038
Because you can recognize
his crooked little finger.

393
00:38:52,337 --> 00:38:55,137
In other words,
we've followed him here.

394
00:38:58,257 --> 00:39:04,099
Here are some animals,
and here the front of a big rhinoceros

395
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,258
with a very large horn.

396
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:12,270
Here you have torch white marks.

397
00:39:12,542 --> 00:39:15,200
The men would light their way
with a torch.

398
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,474
And when the wood
was burnt down,

399
00:39:17,738 --> 00:39:20,258
they would scrape the torch
against the wall

400
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:21,803
to rekindle the flame.

401
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,098
The traces are fresh.

402
00:39:24,299 --> 00:39:27,857
Because you can see these
small fragments of coal that have fallen.

403
00:39:32,116 --> 00:39:36,370
One of these tiny fragments
was tested by radiocarbon dating.

404
00:39:37,046 --> 00:39:41,000
This torch was swiped
28,000 years ago.

405
00:39:46,565 --> 00:39:49,910
Here we have a painting
that is quite interesting.

406
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:54,183
Bacause it represents a couple
of now extinct cave lions.

407
00:39:54,903 --> 00:39:59,008
Here is the male.
He is behind, the larger one.

408
00:39:59,621 --> 00:40:03,871
He's outlined in a single stroke,
more than six ft in length.

409
00:40:05,494 --> 00:40:07,951
In front you have the female.

410
00:40:08,212 --> 00:40:12,752
She is smaller and seems
to rub her flank against the male.

411
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:17,737
This representation of the cave lion

412
00:40:17,938 --> 00:40:20,866
has allowed us to shed light
on a mystery,

413
00:40:21,067 --> 00:40:26,477
because archaeo-zoologists didn't know
if the cave lion had a mane

414
00:40:26,802 --> 00:40:29,181
like the lion today,
living in Africa.

415
00:40:29,422 --> 00:40:34,277
This representation of a cave lion,
more than 30,000 years old,

416
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:37,510
shows us that they
didn't have a mane.

417
00:40:38,505 --> 00:40:42,732
Look at the outline of his head,
which is clearly delineated.

418
00:40:47,273 --> 00:40:49,267
This is wihout a doubt a male,

419
00:40:49,468 --> 00:40:53,355
because we have the scrotum
right here under the tail.

420
00:41:07,504 --> 00:41:10,812
This is one of the most beautiful
panels in the cave.

421
00:41:11,183 --> 00:41:13,559
Along with the lion panel
at the far end.

422
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:18,296
And here we can see
the technique of prehistoric man.

423
00:41:18,313 --> 00:41:22,361
But you can also see their
key knowledge of the animal world.

424
00:41:22,514 --> 00:41:24,077
They tell us stories.

425
00:41:24,789 --> 00:41:27,213
Here you have
an ensemble of horses.

426
00:41:27,448 --> 00:41:30,922
But their open mouths suggest
the animals are whinnying.

427
00:41:31,168 --> 00:41:34,368
That is to say that these images
become audible to us.

428
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:38,082
You see that the two rhinos
are fighting.

429
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:41,803
You can see all the signs of
fury towards each other.

430
00:41:42,147 --> 00:41:45,166
The movement of their legs,
which are thrown forward,

431
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,094
and you can almost
hear the sound...

432
00:41:51,349 --> 00:41:55,073
of their horns colliding
in the movement of the fight.

433
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:59,635
Here you have another story,
a story of lions.

434
00:42:00,044 --> 00:42:03,696
A male courting a female
who is not ready for mating.

435
00:42:03,964 --> 00:42:06,046
She sits and growls.

436
00:42:06,766 --> 00:42:09,192
You can hear the female growling.

437
00:42:09,434 --> 00:42:12,852
She's raising her lips,
she's baring her teeth.

438
00:42:13,024 --> 00:42:14,794
She is not happy.

439
00:42:15,647 --> 00:42:19,319
And here you have
the flight of this bison.

440
00:42:19,574 --> 00:42:20,681
We hear the hooves.

441
00:42:20,906 --> 00:42:24,268
We can make out multiple legs
indicating its movement.

442
00:42:24,429 --> 00:42:28,566
It is escaping from this alcove,
following this auroch.

443
00:42:34,067 --> 00:42:38,662
Mme Baffier takes us down to
the fartherst chamber of the cave.

444
00:42:39,118 --> 00:42:41,920
The mysterious Chamber
of the Lions.

445
00:42:43,995 --> 00:42:47,492
There is a serious level
of toxic CO2 gas

446
00:42:47,593 --> 00:42:49,699
emanating from the roots of trees,

447
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:54,476
which seeps down into the cave
through the porous limestone.

448
00:42:56,151 --> 00:43:00,099
Our time is even more constricted
in this location,

449
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:04,347
and there is no possibility
to get close to the paintings.

450
00:43:06,593 --> 00:43:10,715
There are things you won't
be able to show in your film,

451
00:43:10,971 --> 00:43:12,667
and you won't be able to see.

452
00:43:12,835 --> 00:43:14,475
You can't get closer.

453
00:43:14,902 --> 00:43:18,388
That is the case with these
absolutely marvellous paintings.

454
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,435
This grouping of lions.

455
00:43:21,596 --> 00:43:25,053
It is especially the case
with this rock pendant,

456
00:43:25,129 --> 00:43:28,600
where the lower portion of
a woman's body has been painted.

457
00:43:29,425 --> 00:43:32,012
You have her pubic triangle,

458
00:43:32,251 --> 00:43:35,508
and her legs that seperate,
starting at the knee,

459
00:43:35,509 --> 00:43:36,893
which diverge

460
00:43:37,167 --> 00:43:41,214
and are reminiscent of the
well-known stoneage statuettes

461
00:43:41,606 --> 00:43:45,050
from archaeological digs in the
Swabian Jura in Germany.

462
00:43:46,148 --> 00:43:49,926
We can only see part of this
lower half of this female body,

463
00:43:50,267 --> 00:43:53,581
because we cannot access
the other side of the pendant.

464
00:43:53,796 --> 00:43:55,982
You cannot walk on these grounds,

465
00:43:56,157 --> 00:43:57,693
because they are too fragile.

466
00:43:58,023 --> 00:44:00,786
Your would destroy
the charcoal remains.

467
00:44:00,987 --> 00:44:04,579
You would destroy the tracks left
by the bears and the humans.

468
00:44:05,467 --> 00:44:08,421
You'll have to make do
with this partial image.

469
00:44:09,049 --> 00:44:12,107
If you completed the other
half of this female body

470
00:44:12,432 --> 00:44:14,260
with its other legs symetrically,

471
00:44:14,493 --> 00:44:17,575
you could see that it is
connected to a bison head

472
00:44:17,776 --> 00:44:20,182
that would have
a somewhat human arm.

473
00:44:20,802 --> 00:44:24,526
Here we are
some 30,000 years later

474
00:44:24,752 --> 00:44:27,904
with a myth that has endured
until our day.

475
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:32,212
We can also find this association
of female and bull

476
00:44:32,429 --> 00:44:35,802
in Picasso's drawings of
the Minotaur and the Woman.

477
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:45,457
This is the only partial
representation of a human in the cave.

478
00:44:46,514 --> 00:44:50,097
For the time being,
the other side of the rock pendant

479
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,627
must remain unreachable for us.

480
00:44:55,111 --> 00:44:58,860
The people who created this
are equally enigmatic.

481
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:03,155
Of the few things they left behind,

482
00:45:03,227 --> 00:45:07,732
practical items like flint tools
can be more easily read.

483
00:45:10,772 --> 00:45:14,734
The local museum is filled
with artefacts from the region.

484
00:45:15,026 --> 00:45:17,684
We have made excavations
on the site...

485
00:45:18,269 --> 00:45:22,536
Jean Michel Geneste can only
lead us to a handful of findings

486
00:45:22,765 --> 00:45:24,086
from the Chauvet Cave.

487
00:45:25,408 --> 00:45:28,168
We have only2-3 boxes
in this area.

488
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:33,099
To shed light on
the enigmatic female image,

489
00:45:33,168 --> 00:45:36,771
he has prepared similar figurines
from other regions.

490
00:45:39,142 --> 00:45:44,361
You can see the likeness
in this Willendorf Venus.

491
00:45:45,449 --> 00:45:48,183
It's a copy made in limestone,

492
00:45:48,284 --> 00:45:52,035
found in Austria
from the same period.

493
00:45:52,699 --> 00:45:57,637
In Chauvet, only the lower
part of the belly is preserved.

494
00:45:57,809 --> 00:46:00,045
It's embedded in a bison.

495
00:46:00,289 --> 00:46:03,331
There seems to have existed
a visual convention

496
00:46:03,503 --> 00:46:06,493
extending all the way
beyond Baywatch.

497
00:46:10,078 --> 00:46:13,258
No clear male representation
has been found,

498
00:46:13,259 --> 00:46:20,408
but this lion man comes
from a site in the Swabian Alps.

499
00:46:21,833 --> 00:46:30,107
It's an amazing mixture of
an anthropomorphic shape,

500
00:46:30,476 --> 00:46:33,932
a human body, and the head of a lion.

501
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:38,138
Is is the spirit
of a lion in a man?

502
00:46:38,581 --> 00:46:42,342
Is it a composed creature,
a new being?

503
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:46,016
Such equations can be pondered.

504
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:54,567
What the people who lived
in this valley left behind,

505
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:56,072
is their great art.

506
00:46:56,394 --> 00:47:00,197
It was not a primitive beginning,
or a slow evolution,

507
00:47:00,421 --> 00:47:04,872
it rather burst onto the scene
like a sudden explosive event.

508
00:47:06,011 --> 00:47:10,005
It is as if the modern
human soul had awakened here.

509
00:47:12,112 --> 00:47:14,570
Even more astonishing
to consider is that

510
00:47:14,371 --> 00:47:18,668
at the time Neanderthal man
still roamed this valley.

511
00:47:21,473 --> 00:47:25,100
But there must have been
other forms of artistic expression,

512
00:47:25,201 --> 00:47:27,040
like music for example.

513
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:32,161
For this, we had to
look around in nearby regions.

514
00:47:33,256 --> 00:47:37,563
Southwestern Germany
30-40,000 years ago

515
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:41,298
was connected to this valley
through an icefree corridor.

516
00:47:42,865 --> 00:47:44,515
It should also be noted

517
00:47:44,718 --> 00:47:48,726
that the Alp Mountains
were covered by 9000 ft of ice,

518
00:47:49,028 --> 00:47:50,512
binding so much water

519
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:54,518
that the sea level was
300 ft lower than today.

520
00:47:56,537 --> 00:47:59,804
A  hunter could have walked
from Paris to London

521
00:48:00,078 --> 00:48:03,294
crossing the dry seabed
of the English Channel.

522
00:48:04,891 --> 00:48:07,589
Walking 400 miles in this direction

523
00:48:07,903 --> 00:48:11,304
woud lead you to the
Swabian Alps in Germany.

524
00:48:14,741 --> 00:48:17,217
In the museum of Blaubeuren,

525
00:48:17,418 --> 00:48:21,662
are replicas of the best-known
palaeolithic Venuses.

526
00:48:35,483 --> 00:48:39,793
But this one, the Venus
of Hohle Fels, stands out.

527
00:48:39,953 --> 00:48:44,483
Found in 2008, it is
sensational for its age.

528
00:48:49,022 --> 00:48:52,464
Venus from Hohle Fels
is probably the oldest depiction

529
00:48:52,733 --> 00:48:56,127
of any kind of figurative object
we know at all.

530
00:48:56,128 --> 00:48:58,921
It's the earliest representation
of a human being,

531
00:48:59,122 --> 00:49:04,449
and it's the absolute root of
figurative depiction as we know it.

532
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,714
Later on, we see a range
of animals being depicted.

533
00:49:07,971 --> 00:49:10,612
The animal depictions
in ivory here.

534
00:49:10,613 --> 00:49:14,127
Or the fabulous depictions
from Grotte Chauvet

535
00:49:14,175 --> 00:49:15,562
of mammoths and lions.

536
00:49:15,785 --> 00:49:17,516
We can see a very clear connection

537
00:49:17,617 --> 00:49:21,416
between the Swabian finds
and the depictions in Chauvet.

538
00:49:21,894 --> 00:49:25,305
It's also fascinating that,
at this time 40,000 years ago,

539
00:49:25,501 --> 00:49:27,592
we see evidence for
musical instruments,

540
00:49:27,693 --> 00:49:29,344
a range of personal ornaments.

541
00:49:29,582 --> 00:49:31,581
Mythical depictions
that clearly show

542
00:49:31,682 --> 00:49:33,986
that these people
had a religious concept

543
00:49:33,987 --> 00:49:37,092
evolving the transformation
between humans and animals.

544
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:42,550
This is the original statuette
carved from a mammoth tusk.

545
00:49:43,729 --> 00:49:46,612
If we look at the Venus of
Hohle Fels a bit more closely,

546
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:51,057
we can see very clearly
that the figurine has no head.

547
00:49:51,258 --> 00:49:53,755
Instead of a head,
the figurine has a ring.

548
00:49:53,979 --> 00:49:57,245
It was perhaps worn at times,
suspended on a string.

549
00:49:58,808 --> 00:50:01,091
The sexual attributes are key

550
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:05,573
which clearly link this depiction
to ideas of reproduction,

551
00:50:05,708 --> 00:50:07,110
fecundity, sexuality.

552
00:50:07,411 --> 00:50:11,381
Ideas that are absolutely essential
to all of humanity.

553
00:50:11,382 --> 00:50:12,526
Also today.

554
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:16,332
It's also important to realize
that at this time

555
00:50:16,433 --> 00:50:18,964
much of Europe was
occupied by Neanderthals.

556
00:50:19,181 --> 00:50:21,616
We're dealing with the
critical phase in human evolution

557
00:50:21,717 --> 00:50:25,863
where two forms of humans
are testing their boundaries.

558
00:50:26,101 --> 00:50:28,612
What we find,
over and over again,

559
00:50:28,781 --> 00:50:31,206
is that Neanderthals,
although very sophisticated,

560
00:50:31,398 --> 00:50:33,696
never have this kind of
symbolic artefact.

561
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:34,559
Ever.

562
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:42,875
This small ivory mammoth was
also found near Hohle Fels Cave.

563
00:50:45,393 --> 00:50:49,586
This beautiful horse
comes from the same rigion.

564
00:50:50,636 --> 00:50:53,271
They also found
fragments of flutes.

565
00:50:53,778 --> 00:50:57,109
We asked Dr Conrad
to show us an original.

566
00:50:57,413 --> 00:51:00,839
The ivory flute
is a remarkable artefact

567
00:51:01,095 --> 00:51:03,845
that Maria Malina discovered
a few years back.

568
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:08,846
It's extremely important
that we realize that archaeology today

569
00:51:08,935 --> 00:51:12,305
is not a heroic adventure
with spades and picks,

570
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:16,698
but high-tech scientific work
that's done with indredible detail.

571
00:51:17,164 --> 00:51:19,717
Millimetre by millimetre
the sediments are removed

572
00:51:19,959 --> 00:51:25,537
in these deposits in Chauvet
between 30-40,000 years ago.

573
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:30,856
This detailed work allowed Maria
to identify a whole range of finds,

574
00:51:30,857 --> 00:51:32,833
which she was able to piece together.

575
00:51:32,884 --> 00:51:34,483
You can explain
how that worked out.

576
00:51:35,376 --> 00:51:38,355
We did an inventory
of all the artefact pieces.

577
00:51:38,356 --> 00:51:41,789
Some of the pieces came
from the 70's,

578
00:51:41,790 --> 00:51:43,659
from the first years of excavation.

579
00:51:44,256 --> 00:51:48,643
They were really small pieces,
which you can see in this picture.

580
00:51:48,922 --> 00:51:54,179
The tiny ivory pieces remained
unexplained for three decades.

581
00:51:54,931 --> 00:52:00,221
31 pieces had a
very significant look.

582
00:52:00,322 --> 00:52:04,125
We found pieces with
a part of the finger holes

583
00:52:04,226 --> 00:52:06,388
and with notches on the side.

584
00:52:06,705 --> 00:52:11,901
I thought that these pieces
could be part of an ivory flute.

585
00:52:12,257 --> 00:52:15,571
An important question was
how the flute was made.

586
00:52:15,772 --> 00:52:23,046
You can see, on the long axis,
a split running along the flute.

587
00:52:23,777 --> 00:52:27,643
Inside the two halfs,
they'd hollowed out the flute.

588
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:31,990
These little notches along the axis,
along this split,

589
00:52:32,241 --> 00:52:37,390
helped to refit the two halves
together very precisely.

590
00:52:38,006 --> 00:52:44,432
This flute is only one of eight
recovered from SW Germany.

591
00:52:45,299 --> 00:52:47,397
The caves here have no paintings,

592
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:50,086
but yield many other
objects of art.

593
00:52:50,627 --> 00:52:53,045
In this cave,
the Geissenklösterle Cave,

594
00:52:53,229 --> 00:52:56,580
many important findings
from the Ice Age were made.

595
00:52:57,822 --> 00:53:02,508
We found small ivory statues
of bears and mammoths.

596
00:53:02,509 --> 00:53:04,375
Very tiny mammoths,
very lovely.

597
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:08,085
In 1992, I was part of
the excavation team.

598
00:53:09,028 --> 00:53:13,716
People lived here
30-40,000 years back in time.

599
00:53:14,325 --> 00:53:16,444
At that time,
it was very cold here,

600
00:53:16,668 --> 00:53:19,047
because the Alp Mountains
were covered by a glacier

601
00:53:19,167 --> 00:53:21,702
about 2500 metres thick.

602
00:53:22,342 --> 00:53:27,160
In the valley down there,
raindeer and mammoths roamed.

603
00:53:27,456 --> 00:53:28,506
It was very cold.

604
00:53:28,507 --> 00:53:31,878
That's why I'm dressed up
like an Inuit.

605
00:53:33,472 --> 00:53:38,786
We presume that Ice Age
people were clothed this way.

606
00:53:39,318 --> 00:53:43,287
In raindeer fur, and in
boots made of raindeer fur

607
00:53:43,543 --> 00:53:44,288
and raindeer leather.

608
00:53:45,457 --> 00:53:48,843
Otherwise you couldn't
stand the cold.

609
00:53:52,482 --> 00:53:54,906
One of the most important finds

610
00:53:55,546 --> 00:53:57,289
we made in this cave

611
00:53:57,507 --> 00:54:01,719
was a tiny flute made
out of the radius of a vulture.

612
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:08,940
An astonishing fact is
that it's pentatonic.

613
00:54:09,606 --> 00:54:13,726
The same tonality
we're used to hearing today.

614
00:54:15,211 --> 00:54:19,126
If you like, I'll try to
play a tune for you.

615
00:54:36,534 --> 00:54:40,530
I reconstructed the instrument,
tried to play some tunes

616
00:54:40,531 --> 00:54:41,811
and came across this one.

617
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:03,344
Sounds a bit like
Stars Bangled Banner.

618
00:55:10,426 --> 00:55:12,612
Back in France,
near Chauvet Cave,

619
00:55:13,822 --> 00:55:17,344
explorers using more
primal techniques

620
00:55:17,445 --> 00:55:20,126
in search of still hidden
underground chambers,

621
00:55:20,677 --> 00:55:22,679
roam the landscape.

622
00:55:54,673 --> 00:55:56,475
Professional cave explorers

623
00:55:56,576 --> 00:55:59,796
have techniques for finding
underground chambers.

624
00:56:00,081 --> 00:56:04,043
There are air currents, so they use
the back of their hands

625
00:56:04,482 --> 00:56:07,698
or their cheeks,
to feel for a faint draft of air

626
00:56:07,799 --> 00:56:09,660
that may be coming
out of a cave.

627
00:56:12,457 --> 00:56:14,660
I'm trying to do
things differently.

628
00:56:14,853 --> 00:56:18,812
I have the habit of using
my sense of smell in my profession.

629
00:56:20,816 --> 00:56:25,060
I sniff the smells coming from
the interior of the cave.

630
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:32,913
Here I couldn't smell anything
except the exterior landscape.

631
00:56:33,619 --> 00:56:37,122
Outside you can smell
the earth, the wild thyme,

632
00:56:37,538 --> 00:56:38,964
the ivy...

633
00:56:39,811 --> 00:56:41,374
You can smell a range of things,

634
00:56:41,553 --> 00:56:43,821
but nothing specific
related to a cavern

635
00:56:44,022 --> 00:56:46,468
that's been closed
for thousands of years.

636
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:55,702
This is my personal technique,
because I design perfumes.

637
00:56:56,343 --> 00:56:59,327
It's a way to experience it
in a different manner.

638
00:56:59,328 --> 00:57:02,538
I have always created perfumes.

639
00:57:03,529 --> 00:57:08,033
I was the president of the
French society of perfumers

640
00:57:08,034 --> 00:57:09,113
for some years.

641
00:57:34,253 --> 00:57:37,960
There are plans to build
a theme park for tourists

642
00:57:38,089 --> 00:57:42,145
with a precise replica of
the cave a few miles from here.

643
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:47,304
This replica may even contain

644
00:57:47,305 --> 00:57:51,426
a recreation of the odor
of the prehistoric interior.

645
00:58:14,253 --> 00:58:19,094
Evidently, the odor you can smell
right now is quite attenuated.

646
00:58:19,796 --> 00:58:21,478
It's very subtle.

647
00:58:22,611 --> 00:58:24,637
There are not
many emanations,

648
00:58:24,438 --> 00:58:29,544
but our imagination permits us
to try to reconstruct the scene.

649
00:58:30,823 --> 00:58:34,385
The scene with its odors
from 25,000 years ago

650
00:58:34,553 --> 00:58:37,376
with all the animals
that would have been there.

651
00:58:37,377 --> 00:58:42,808
Bears, wolves, perhaps
even rhinoceroses and men.

652
00:58:43,375 --> 00:58:47,867
The presence of their lives,
meaning burnt wood, resins,

653
00:58:48,099 --> 00:58:51,357
the odors of everything
from the natural world

654
00:58:51,342 --> 00:58:53,390
that surrounds this cave.

655
00:58:53,723 --> 00:58:56,461
We can go back
with our imagination.

656
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:08,632
With his sense of wonder,
the cave transforms

657
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:12,096
into an enchanted world
of the imaginary

658
00:59:12,097 --> 00:59:15,131
where time and space
lose their meaning.

659
00:59:17,463 --> 00:59:21,186
These crystal formations
take thousands of years to grow.

660
00:59:22,451 --> 00:59:25,838
The artists of the cave
never even saw them,

661
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:28,434
as many of them only
started to form

662
00:59:28,605 --> 00:59:31,600
after the landslides sealed
the entrance.

663
00:59:52,488 --> 00:59:55,040
In a forbidden recess of the cave,

664
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,968
there's a footprint of an
8-year-old boy

665
00:59:58,281 --> 01:00:01,012
next to the footprint
of a wolf.

666
01:00:02,814 --> 01:00:05,552
Did a hungry wolf
stalk the boy?

667
01:00:06,203 --> 01:00:08,507
Or did they walk together
as friends?

668
01:00:09,868 --> 01:00:13,311
Or were their tracks
made thousand years apart?

669
01:00:14,358 --> 01:00:15,736
We'll never know.

670
01:01:53,408 --> 01:01:55,857
Dwarfed by these large chambers,

671
01:01:55,955 --> 01:01:58,601
illuminated by all
the wandering lights,

672
01:01:58,934 --> 01:02:03,256
sometimes we were overcome
by a strange, irrational sensation.

673
01:02:03,785 --> 01:02:08,090
As if we were disturbing
the palaeolithic people in their work.

674
01:02:10,232 --> 01:02:12,816
It felt like eyes upon us.

675
01:02:14,512 --> 01:02:18,019
This sensation occured
to some of the scientists,

676
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:21,094
and also the discoverers
of the cave.

677
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:26,958
It was a relief
to surface again above ground.

678
01:02:28,577 --> 01:02:32,050
Back outside, we asked
Jean Michel Geneste

679
01:02:32,051 --> 01:02:35,251
about hunting techniques
of palaeolithic people.

680
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:39,088
Millennia before the invention
of bow and arrow.

681
01:02:39,932 --> 01:02:46,918
The original Chauvet Cave people
had a lots of large game.

682
01:02:46,998 --> 01:02:51,655
They hunted everywhere
in France and Europe.

683
01:02:51,818 --> 01:02:54,796
In their settlements we found
a lot of bones

684
01:02:54,897 --> 01:02:59,647
of reindeer, bison, horses,
and sometimes mammoths.

685
01:02:59,799 --> 01:03:03,588
They had developed
very special hunting techniques.

686
01:03:05,710 --> 01:03:09,873
The original spearpoint system
is very ingenious.

687
01:03:09,874 --> 01:03:12,755
It's a spearpoint on a wooden shaft.

688
01:03:13,806 --> 01:03:20,073
The spearpoint is tied
firmly to the shaft.

689
01:03:20,609 --> 01:03:25,523
The system uses a fork
with a piece inside.

690
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:27,316
So it's very strong.

691
01:03:27,682 --> 01:03:33,443
It was developed and made
to kill bison or horses like that.

692
01:03:33,768 --> 01:03:37,857
It's very aggressive, strong,
and powerful.

693
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:44,655
This kind of weapon was
thrown not only by hand,

694
01:03:45,304 --> 01:03:47,312
because it wasn't
very effective.

695
01:03:47,593 --> 01:03:53,603
We suspect that in the beginning
of the Upper Palaeolithic

696
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:57,149
they developed a
spear throwing technique.

697
01:03:57,623 --> 01:04:05,378
At the tip, the spear thrower
is provided with a hook, a tooth.

698
01:04:05,613 --> 01:04:13,415
The elongated handle
gives the spear a lot of power.

699
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:19,571
It increases precision
and targeting accuracy.

700
01:04:20,011 --> 01:04:21,531
I will show you.

701
01:04:24,906 --> 01:04:28,348
You see the spear
with the flint point.

702
01:04:28,981 --> 01:04:36,364
There must be a small
depression at the back of the spear.

703
01:04:37,086 --> 01:04:44,953
We suspect they sometimes
used feathers to maintain direction.

704
01:04:44,954 --> 01:04:49,044
I will try to show you
how to kill a horse.

705
01:04:56,361 --> 01:04:59,491
His efforts may not look
very convincing,

706
01:04:59,854 --> 01:05:02,013
but this is a powerful weapon.

707
01:05:02,434 --> 01:05:05,501
Spearheads have been found
deeply embedded

708
01:05:05,602 --> 01:05:08,621
in the shoulder blades
of horses and mammoths.

709
01:05:16,354 --> 01:05:20,167
It flies 30 metres
in a straight line.

710
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:27,435
The palaeolithic men were
better than you, I guess.

711
01:05:28,019 --> 01:05:34,533
It could be difficult for
me to kill a horse with this.

712
01:05:38,941 --> 01:05:43,345
By mid-April, scientific research
has ended for the year.

713
01:05:43,804 --> 01:05:47,078
Now we are allowed
full access to the cave.

714
01:05:48,601 --> 01:05:53,515
But even that is restricted
to a single week, 4 hrs a day.

715
01:05:54,852 --> 01:05:57,974
The famous cave of Lascaux
had to be shut down,

716
01:05:58,223 --> 01:06:01,043
because the breath
of scores of tourists

717
01:06:01,225 --> 01:06:04,586
has caused mould
to grow on the walls.

718
01:06:11,469 --> 01:06:13,472
We enter Chauvet Cave,

719
01:06:13,573 --> 01:06:17,287
aware that this may be
the only and last opportunity

720
01:06:17,388 --> 01:06:18,961
to film inside.

721
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:29,525
The mystery of the minotaur
and the female began to unfold

722
01:07:29,589 --> 01:07:32,543
when our guides allowed us
to mount a small camera

723
01:07:32,544 --> 01:07:35,244
on the stick with which
we reached out.

724
01:07:38,631 --> 01:07:42,747
The bison seems to embrace
the sex of a naked woman.

725
01:07:50,323 --> 01:07:54,269
Traditional people, and they think,
people of the Palaeolithic,

726
01:07:54,393 --> 01:08:00,716
probably had two concepts that
changed our view of the world.

727
01:08:01,276 --> 01:08:05,477
The concepts of fluidity
and permeability.

728
01:08:05,621 --> 01:08:09,584
Fluidity means that
the categories we have,

729
01:08:09,616 --> 01:08:15,898
man, woman, horse, tree etc.,
can shift.

730
01:08:16,089 --> 01:08:21,331
A tree can speak, a man can get
transformed into an animal,

731
01:08:21,523 --> 01:08:25,911
and the other way around,
given certain circumstances.

732
01:08:26,122 --> 01:08:29,445
The concept of permeability is

733
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:34,726
that there are no barriers
between the world where we are

734
01:08:35,095 --> 01:08:36,750
and the world of the spirits.

735
01:08:38,062 --> 01:08:43,929
A wall can talk to us,
or accept us, or refuse us.

736
01:08:45,241 --> 01:08:50,914
A shaman can send his spirit
to the world of the supernatural.

737
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:57,553
Or he can receive visiting
supernatural spirits.

738
01:08:57,954 --> 01:09:00,629
If you put the two
concepts together,

739
01:09:00,721 --> 01:09:05,552
you realize how different
life must have been

740
01:09:05,685 --> 01:09:07,665
from the way we live now.

741
01:09:11,473 --> 01:09:13,772
Humans have been
described in many ways.

742
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:20,173
For a while, it was homo sapiens
and it still is homo sapiens,

743
01:09:20,237 --> 01:09:21,838
the man who knows.

744
01:09:22,182 --> 01:09:25,783
I don't think it's
a good definition at all.

745
01:09:25,996 --> 01:09:28,384
We don't know,
we don't know much.

746
01:09:28,659 --> 01:09:34,093
I would say
Homo Spiritualis.

747
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:38,616
The strongest hint
of something spiritual,

748
01:09:38,703 --> 01:09:41,230
some spiritual ceremony
in the cave,

749
01:09:41,502 --> 01:09:43,173
is this bear skull.

750
01:09:43,739 --> 01:09:46,477
It has been placed
dead center on a rock,

751
01:09:46,636 --> 01:09:48,653
resembling an altar.

752
01:09:50,384 --> 01:09:52,762
The staging seems deliberate.

753
01:09:54,102 --> 01:09:57,113
The skull faces
the entrance of the cave.

754
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:00,888
Around it fragments
of charcoal were found,

755
01:10:01,270 --> 01:10:03,897
potentially used as incense.

756
01:10:08,814 --> 01:10:13,298
What exactly took place here
only the paintings could tell us.

757
01:13:05,814 --> 01:13:09,377
If you want to have
an understanding of it,

758
01:13:09,478 --> 01:13:12,296
you must go out of the cave.

759
01:13:13,824 --> 01:13:17,498
You must start from the cave
and then go outside.

760
01:13:17,588 --> 01:13:19,782
How far outside?
Where would you go?

761
01:13:20,583 --> 01:13:21,835
I would say everywhere...

762
01:13:23,818 --> 01:13:27,829
A look at the different cultures
would be a good way

763
01:13:28,032 --> 01:13:30,999
to better understand
how different cultures

764
01:13:31,209 --> 01:13:33,481
could have coped with rock art.

765
01:13:34,185 --> 01:13:38,540
In Australia, in North America,
or in South Africa.

766
01:13:38,647 --> 01:13:42,969
Aboriginees in Australia,
who lived until recently

767
01:13:43,184 --> 01:13:45,914
almost like Stoneage people.

768
01:13:45,915 --> 01:13:52,252
They used to paint
and create rock art

769
01:13:52,355 --> 01:13:54,430
until the 1970s.

770
01:13:54,684 --> 01:13:58,662
In some places, I think
there still are traditions

771
01:13:58,663 --> 01:14:00,158
of creating rock art.

772
01:14:00,437 --> 01:14:04,277
Of course, it has changed
since the beginning of the century

773
01:14:04,348 --> 01:14:07,043
when they were discovered.

774
01:14:07,865 --> 01:14:11,486
It can show us different ways
of looking at rock art,

775
01:14:11,487 --> 01:14:14,204
that are not our way
of looking at rock art.

776
01:14:14,345 --> 01:14:16,050
Do you have an example?

777
01:14:16,867 --> 01:14:23,245
In Northern Australia in the 1970s,

778
01:14:23,246 --> 01:14:27,143
an ethnographer was in the field
with an Aboriginee

779
01:14:27,144 --> 01:14:29,121
who was his informer.

780
01:14:29,544 --> 01:14:36,329
Once they came to a rock shelter
that contained beautiful paintings,

781
01:14:36,530 --> 01:14:38,008
but they were decaying.

782
01:14:39,370 --> 01:14:42,100
The Aboriginees became sad

783
01:14:42,101 --> 01:14:44,212
when they saw
the paintings decaying.

784
01:14:44,648 --> 01:14:48,657
In that region, there is a tradition
of touching up the paintings.

785
01:14:49,312 --> 01:14:50,714
Time after time.

786
01:14:51,081 --> 01:14:56,723
So, he sat down and started
to touch up the paintings.

787
01:14:58,699 --> 01:15:06,447
The ethnographer asked the question
all Westerners would ask,

788
01:15:06,639 --> 01:15:07,999
"Why are you painting?"

789
01:15:09,136 --> 01:15:14,426
The man answered,
and his answer was troubling,

790
01:15:14,583 --> 01:15:18,139
because he answered,
"I am not painting."

791
01:15:19,437 --> 01:15:25,336
"It's the hand of a spirit
that is actually painting now."

792
01:15:25,912 --> 01:15:27,465
The hand of a spirit?

793
01:15:28,673 --> 01:15:32,427
The man is a part of the spirit.

794
01:22:50,202 --> 01:22:53,382
Do you think the paintings
in Chauvet Cave

795
01:22:53,383 --> 01:22:57,757
were somehow the beginning
of the modern human soul?

796
01:22:57,908 --> 01:23:00,041
What constitutes humanness?

797
01:23:00,690 --> 01:23:08,765
Humanness is the ability
to adapt to the world.

798
01:23:09,541 --> 01:23:18,057
Man needs to adapt to
the landscape and to other beings,

799
01:23:18,268 --> 01:23:20,829
animals and human groups.

800
01:23:22,887 --> 01:23:25,177
And to communicate.

801
01:23:25,425 --> 01:23:33,363
To communicate by inscribing
memories on specific, odd things

802
01:23:33,761 --> 01:23:37,292
like walls, pieces of wood...

803
01:23:38,741 --> 01:23:42,056
An invention made
by the Cromagnon.

804
01:23:42,244 --> 01:23:43,454
How about music?

805
01:23:44,142 --> 01:23:47,808
Yes, songs, mythology, music.

806
01:23:48,409 --> 01:23:53,287
The invention of the
figurative representation

807
01:23:53,504 --> 01:23:55,298
of animals, of man, of things

808
01:23:55,587 --> 01:24:00,757
is a way for humans
to communicate with the future.

809
01:24:01,781 --> 01:24:05,671
A way of evoking the past
and transmitting information

810
01:24:05,672 --> 01:24:09,063
by means better than language.

811
01:24:09,526 --> 01:24:11,921
Signs instead of
oral communication.

812
01:24:12,498 --> 01:24:18,035
This invention still holds
in our world today.

813
01:24:18,036 --> 01:24:19,933
This camera for example.

814
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:49,513
On the Rhône River is one
of the largest nuclear power plants

815
01:24:49,514 --> 01:24:50,873
in France.

816
01:24:51,522 --> 01:24:56,158
The Chauvet Cave is located
only 20 miles as the crow flies

817
01:24:56,159 --> 01:24:59,035
beyond these hills
in the background.

818
01:25:00,456 --> 01:25:05,076
A surplus of warm water
that was used to cool these reactors

819
01:25:05,077 --> 01:25:10,128
is diverted half a mile away
to create a tropical biosphere.

820
01:25:11,815 --> 01:25:14,984
Warm steam fills
enormous greenhouses.

821
01:25:15,331 --> 01:25:17,532
And the site is expanding.

822
01:25:38,209 --> 01:25:42,411
Crocodiles have been introduced
into this brooding jungle

823
01:25:42,967 --> 01:25:48,288
and warmed by reactor water,
man, do they thrive!

824
01:25:50,217 --> 01:25:52,267
There are already
hundreds of them.

825
01:26:02,154 --> 01:26:08,269
Not surprisingly, albinos swim
and breathe in these waters.

826
01:26:09,817 --> 01:26:12,738
A thought is born
in this surreal environment.

827
01:26:13,649 --> 01:26:17,945
Not long ago,
a few ten thousand years back,

828
01:26:18,110 --> 01:26:21,523
there were glasiers here,
9000 ft thick.

829
01:26:22,983 --> 01:26:26,377
Now a new climate
is steaming and spreading.

830
01:26:29,903 --> 01:26:33,470
Fairly soon these albinos
might reach Chauvet Cave.

831
01:26:35,114 --> 01:26:39,042
Looking at the paintings,
what will they make of them?

832
01:26:53,943 --> 01:26:57,018
Nothing is real.
Nothing is certain.

833
01:26:58,935 --> 01:27:00,482
It is hard to decide

834
01:27:01,011 --> 01:27:06,001
if these creatures are
dividing into their own doppelgänger.

835
01:27:10,028 --> 01:27:12,702
And do they really meet,

836
01:27:12,703 --> 01:27:16,391
or is it just their own imaginary
mirror reflection?

837
01:27:22,634 --> 01:27:26,727
Are we possibly
the crocodiles who look back

838
01:27:26,728 --> 01:27:28,873
into an abyss of time,

839
01:27:28,947 --> 01:27:31,966
when we see the paintings
of Chauvet Cave?

840
01:27:34,067 --> 01:27:36,167
