1
00:07:47,072 --> 00:07:49,302
Watch the birdie!

2
00:13:36,487 --> 00:13:40,787
Come on, have something to drink
with us. Come on, drink with us.

3
00:13:40,892 --> 00:13:43,554
Drink it, drink it...

4
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:35,134
Do you want gold?

5
00:30:38,542 --> 00:30:39,702
Yes.

6
00:34:43,687 --> 00:34:48,920
You are excrement.
You can change yourself into gold.

7
00:35:27,397 --> 00:35:32,494
You broke the looking glass.
Now break the stone.

8
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:57,651
Each stone has a soul,

9
00:35:57,761 --> 00:36:01,857
formed by the work of millions of years.

10
00:36:05,001 --> 00:36:08,402
The tarot will teach you
how to create a soul.

11
00:37:59,015 --> 00:38:01,040
To know.

12
00:38:14,097 --> 00:38:15,962
To dare.

13
00:38:28,945 --> 00:38:30,845
To want.

14
00:38:35,952 --> 00:38:37,817
To be silent.

15
00:38:44,394 --> 00:38:48,023
The same force the vulture
uses to seize the ox

16
00:38:48,131 --> 00:38:52,124
is needed by the ox
to receive the vulture.

17
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:39,548
The fish thinks about his hunger,
not about the fisherman.

18
00:39:42,485 --> 00:39:46,012
It is the master
who seeks the disciple.

19
00:39:49,692 --> 00:39:52,217
You want to know the secret,

20
00:39:52,328 --> 00:39:55,729
but man can achieve nothing
by himself.

21
00:39:55,832 --> 00:40:00,098
To accomplish the alchemical work,
you will have these companions.

22
00:40:00,203 --> 00:40:03,570
They are thieves like you,
but on another level.

23
00:40:03,673 --> 00:40:06,938
They are the most powerful people
on the planet.

24
00:40:07,043 --> 00:40:10,774
Industrialists and politicians.

25
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,715
My name is Fon, my planet is Venus.

26
00:40:16,786 --> 00:40:21,485
My business is devoted to the comfort
and beauty of the human body -

27
00:40:21,591 --> 00:40:26,324
beds, mattresses, fabrics,

28
00:40:26,429 --> 00:40:29,489
clothing, cosmetics.

29
00:40:45,615 --> 00:40:48,379
My father is the creator of this empire.

30
00:40:48,485 --> 00:40:52,785
He is deaf, dumb and blind.

31
00:40:55,058 --> 00:40:58,289
Before making a decision,
he consults with my mother's mummy.

32
00:40:58,394 --> 00:41:00,624
He puts his hand into her sex.

33
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:05,258
If it's moist, it's yes.
If it's dry, it's no.

34
00:41:10,406 --> 00:41:12,237
These are my wives.

35
00:41:12,342 --> 00:41:15,368
I make love to them
only during working hours.

36
00:41:15,478 --> 00:41:20,279
They begin as workers,
then I promote them to secretaries.

37
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:23,430
We know that people want to be loved,

38
00:43:23,539 --> 00:43:27,703
not for who they are
but for what they appear to be.

39
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:30,643
So we have created a line of masks,

40
00:43:30,747 --> 00:43:35,241
that have the texture,
warmth, and smell,

41
00:43:35,351 --> 00:43:38,445
of living human beings.

42
00:43:38,554 --> 00:43:42,547
A customer can have any face
she wants.

43
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:47,096
Every face is unique
and lasts a lifetime.

44
00:43:47,196 --> 00:43:50,495
She can wear her artificial face
to the grave.

45
00:43:51,634 --> 00:43:55,695
Our make-up department for corpses
eliminates the appearance of death.

46
00:43:55,805 --> 00:43:57,796
Not only do we beautify cadavers,

47
00:43:57,907 --> 00:44:01,434
we also equip them
with electronic devices.

48
00:44:01,544 --> 00:44:04,377
They can kiss their family goodbye...

49
00:44:11,387 --> 00:44:14,220
...participate in their own last rites...

50
00:44:19,996 --> 00:44:21,861
...or give a live show.

51
00:44:35,144 --> 00:44:38,978
My name is Isla, my planet is Mars.

52
00:46:16,846 --> 00:46:20,441
Every morning I wake up
my male secretaries.

53
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:32,790
I manufacture and sell weapons.

54
00:46:35,798 --> 00:46:39,393
We produce bombers,
hydrogen bombs,

55
00:46:39,502 --> 00:46:42,665
ray guns, deadly bacteria,

56
00:46:42,772 --> 00:46:48,938
anti-matter waves,
carcinogenic gases, etcetera.

57
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:05,850
We are experimenting with a drug
to create delusions of grandeur.

58
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:11,329
Another drug turns harmless people
into wild beasts.

59
00:47:28,517 --> 00:47:32,715
The young generation needs arms
for its marches and sit-ins.

60
00:47:43,466 --> 00:47:46,697
We have psychedelic shotguns...

61
00:47:48,437 --> 00:47:50,371
...grenade necklaces...

62
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,670
...rock and roll weapons...

63
00:47:55,144 --> 00:47:57,169
...mystical weapons for Buddhists...

64
00:47:58,014 --> 00:47:59,413
...Jews...

65
00:48:01,183 --> 00:48:03,117
...and Christians.

66
00:48:07,924 --> 00:48:12,384
My name is Klen,
my planet is Jupiter.

67
00:48:12,495 --> 00:48:14,486
My house.

68
00:48:20,503 --> 00:48:22,494
My wife.

69
00:49:13,422 --> 00:49:15,413
My chaffer.

70
00:49:33,409 --> 00:49:35,240
- My lover.
- Hi!

71
00:49:35,344 --> 00:49:37,335
A thousand a week.

72
00:50:34,236 --> 00:50:36,227
My art factory.

73
00:50:41,644 --> 00:50:45,102
We produce a new line of art
every season.

74
00:51:47,676 --> 00:51:50,474
We created a love machine.

75
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:54,037
To make it live the spectator
has to work with it, guide it,

76
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:57,642
receive it,
give himself in the act of love.

77
00:51:57,753 --> 00:52:02,520
With this electronic rod
he will rub its mechanical vagina.

78
00:52:02,625 --> 00:52:07,722
The spectator's skill will determine
the machine's ability to reach a climax.

79
00:52:39,361 --> 00:52:41,727
My chaffer is a bad lover.

80
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:43,855
He didn't know how to satisfy it.

81
00:52:43,966 --> 00:52:47,197
But this woman,
I know her techniques very well,

82
00:52:47,303 --> 00:52:49,533
will produce the electronic orgasm.

83
00:52:49,638 --> 00:52:51,469
Frigid!

84
00:54:03,746 --> 00:54:08,149
My name is Sel, my planet is Saturn.

85
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:11,117
My customers are children.

86
00:56:52,581 --> 00:56:55,846
We manufacture war toys.

87
00:57:19,475 --> 00:57:23,605
Workers needed in the miniature
plastic bomb shop.

88
00:57:38,794 --> 00:57:41,490
We have an electronic computer

89
00:57:41,597 --> 00:57:45,431
programmed with the politics
of the government.

90
00:57:45,534 --> 00:57:47,627
The government is our client.

91
00:57:53,275 --> 00:57:58,679
We feed the computer data
on coming wars and revolutions.

92
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:01,908
It tells us what kind of toys to produce

93
00:58:02,017 --> 00:58:04,451
to condition children from birth.

94
00:58:07,356 --> 00:58:13,261
If the government calculates it will be
necessary to wage war against Peru,

95
00:58:13,362 --> 00:58:16,593
our machine studies the Peruvians
and tells us what to do.

96
00:58:20,235 --> 00:58:24,831
We manufacture hyper-sexed
brown native vampires,

97
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:28,706
who can only be destroyed
by a cross the color of white skin.

98
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:32,109
We create a laxative
that induces vomiting.

99
00:58:32,214 --> 00:58:36,947
We name it after the capital of Peru
and tint it with the color of the natives.

100
00:58:37,052 --> 00:58:40,351
We started a comic book campaign.

101
00:59:04,546 --> 00:59:07,242
For 15 years in advance,

102
00:59:07,349 --> 00:59:11,183
we condition children
to hate the future enemy.

103
00:59:49,524 --> 00:59:53,426
In 15 years these children
will go off to war,

104
00:59:53,528 --> 00:59:56,759
to kill Peruvians with pleasure.

105
01:00:01,503 --> 01:00:04,631
My name is Berg,
my planet is Uranus.

106
01:01:31,259 --> 01:01:34,160
Our window is the wrong size,

107
01:01:34,262 --> 01:01:36,093
I don't like it.

108
01:01:36,198 --> 01:01:42,262
Berg, why do we have
that enormous hole in the wall?

109
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:44,361
Close it up!

110
01:02:16,705 --> 01:02:19,697
Our little baby is hungry.

111
01:03:26,208 --> 01:03:29,974
- Have you finished the report?
- No.

112
01:03:51,867 --> 01:03:55,667
The president wants the report.
Hurry up! Hurry!

113
01:04:14,155 --> 01:04:17,022
I am financial adviser to the president.

114
01:04:38,513 --> 01:04:40,674
To save the country's economy,

115
01:04:40,782 --> 01:04:45,776
we must eliminate four million citizens
in the next five years.

116
01:04:50,825 --> 01:04:54,192
Begin the operations
of the gas chambers.

117
01:04:54,296 --> 01:04:58,926
Gas schools, gas universities,
gas libraries, gas museums,

118
01:04:59,034 --> 01:05:02,197
gas dance halls,
and gas whore houses, etcetera.

119
01:06:08,536 --> 01:06:10,595
I hate you! I hate you!

120
01:06:15,744 --> 01:06:19,271
My name is Axon, my planet is Neptune.

121
01:06:19,381 --> 01:06:21,781
I am the chief of police.

122
01:07:29,050 --> 01:07:31,985
This is the most beautiful day
of your life.

123
01:07:32,087 --> 01:07:37,218
Of your own free will you came
to surrender part of your body to me.

124
01:07:37,325 --> 01:07:40,260
You decided to undergo the initiation

125
01:07:40,361 --> 01:07:46,061
that 999
other heroes have passed.

126
01:07:54,976 --> 01:08:01,745
Your sacrifice completes my
sanctuary of one thousand testicles.

127
01:08:14,696 --> 01:08:20,134
This is the holy book.
Learn to believe in me.

128
01:10:43,611 --> 01:10:48,275
Axon is the truth and the power
and the light...

129
01:10:54,522 --> 01:10:59,050
My name is Lut, my planet is Pluto.

130
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:01,492
My business is architecture.

131
01:11:13,841 --> 01:11:15,672
Where is he?

132
01:11:15,777 --> 01:11:19,144
He's there, he's there!

133
01:11:19,247 --> 01:11:21,078
No, no he's not!

134
01:11:33,027 --> 01:11:36,758
He's up there. There he is!
He's up there!

135
01:11:40,034 --> 01:11:42,969
Go get him!
Come on, let's go get him!

136
01:11:44,272 --> 01:11:46,365
Where is he?

137
01:11:51,946 --> 01:11:53,811
There he is!

138
01:12:00,955 --> 01:12:05,289
When we built this multi-family complex
we made a big mistake -

139
01:12:05,393 --> 01:12:07,554
we lost money.

140
01:12:08,796 --> 01:12:12,061
We gave them small gardens
and windows, we installed water,

141
01:12:12,166 --> 01:12:14,100
lighting, and heating systems.

142
01:12:14,202 --> 01:12:16,693
This was a wrong concept.

143
01:12:18,373 --> 01:12:21,968
A man doesn't need a home,
all he needs is a shelter.

144
01:12:22,076 --> 01:12:26,342
If we can sell him on the idea
of a shelter, we can make millions.

145
01:12:47,602 --> 01:12:52,699
A worker will come here only to sleep,
he won't need electricity or water.

146
01:12:52,807 --> 01:12:57,540
He won't have to cook,
we'll condition him to eat at the factory.

147
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:02,847
These are communal latrine trucks
for the entire building.

148
01:15:44,278 --> 01:15:49,272
You have power and money,
but you are mortal.

149
01:15:49,383 --> 01:15:52,216
You know you cannot escape death.

150
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:55,153
But immortality can be obtained.

151
01:16:00,494 --> 01:16:04,362
In old traditions they speak
of holy mountains.

152
01:16:05,232 --> 01:16:07,564
The Meru mountain of India.

153
01:16:10,504 --> 01:16:13,098
Mount Kunlun of the Taoists.

154
01:16:14,709 --> 01:16:16,700
The Karakoram of the Himalaya.

155
01:16:18,179 --> 01:16:20,238
The mountain of the philosophers.

156
01:16:21,182 --> 01:16:23,446
The Rosicrucian mountain.

157
01:16:23,551 --> 01:16:26,714
The Cabalistic mountain
of San Juan De La Cruz.

158
01:16:26,821 --> 01:16:30,018
There are many other holy mountains.

159
01:16:30,124 --> 01:16:33,025
The legend is always the same.

160
01:16:33,127 --> 01:16:37,120
Nine Immortal men live on top
of the mountain.

161
01:16:37,231 --> 01:16:40,200
From the highest peak
they direct our world.

162
01:16:40,301 --> 01:16:44,931
They hold the secret
to the conquest of death.

163
01:16:45,039 --> 01:16:49,271
They are more
than 40,000 years old.

164
01:16:49,377 --> 01:16:52,175
But they were once like ourselves.

165
01:16:52,279 --> 01:16:55,510
If others have succeeded
in conquering death,

166
01:16:55,616 --> 01:16:58,312
why must we accept it?

167
01:16:58,419 --> 01:17:03,413
I know where the Immortals live
and how to obtain their secret.

168
01:17:08,329 --> 01:17:11,355
In this ancient Rosicrucian manuscript,

169
01:17:11,465 --> 01:17:16,596
I found an etching of the Nine Immortals
and the place where they live.

170
01:17:16,704 --> 01:17:19,730
The holy mountain of Lotus Island.

171
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:25,335
Some men join forces to assault banks
and steal money, pieces of paper.

172
01:17:25,446 --> 01:17:31,351
We must unite our forces to assault
the holy mountain,

173
01:17:31,452 --> 01:17:35,354
and rob its wise men
of their secret of immortality.

174
01:17:35,456 --> 01:17:38,118
But to conquer the wisdom
of the Immortals,

175
01:17:38,225 --> 01:17:40,455
we too must become wise men.

176
01:17:40,561 --> 01:17:45,624
The elements of chemistry
are many, but finite.

177
01:17:45,733 --> 01:17:49,260
So are the techniques of enlightenment.

178
01:17:49,370 --> 01:17:54,171
To reach it more quickly
we will combine the techniques.

179
01:17:54,275 --> 01:17:59,941
With the correct formula, any human
being can become enlightened.

180
01:18:02,249 --> 01:18:04,911
The Immortals are a group.

181
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:09,615
If we are to succeed,
we must cease to be individuals,

182
01:18:09,724 --> 01:18:11,783
and become a collective being.

183
01:18:30,978 --> 01:18:32,912
Burn your money!

184
01:19:51,792 --> 01:19:56,695
Thief! If you don't want to die,
kill your money.

185
01:20:11,045 --> 01:20:14,310
We shall destroy the self image,

186
01:20:14,415 --> 01:20:18,442
unsteady, wavering, bewildered,

187
01:20:18,552 --> 01:20:22,989
full of desire, distracted, confused.

188
01:20:23,090 --> 01:20:29,120
When the self concept thinks,
this is I and that is mine,

189
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:33,997
he binds himself
and he forgets the great self.

190
01:22:55,342 --> 01:22:59,176
- His feet stink like a rotten dog.
- He has beautiful teeth.

191
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:01,770
I can't stand the smell.

192
01:23:21,969 --> 01:23:26,702
When he puts all your bones back
together, you will like his smell.

193
01:23:36,817 --> 01:23:42,255
Man learned to cultivate the earth
by weakening the plants,

194
01:23:42,356 --> 01:23:47,089
wild plants remained as they were
at the moment of creation.

195
01:23:47,194 --> 01:23:50,652
They are the humble
guardians of the secret.

196
01:24:43,450 --> 01:24:48,752
The flower knows...
you don't need to ask it.

197
01:26:23,917 --> 01:26:27,751
The dog will take your senses
away with him.

198
01:26:27,854 --> 01:26:30,152
He can see for you.

199
01:26:39,233 --> 01:26:44,068
The delicate scent of flowers
is the fragrance of the universe.

200
01:26:44,171 --> 01:26:48,835
I eat the flower,
and its perfume is my blood.

201
01:26:48,942 --> 01:26:54,847
Together we form a dog,
in search of the sacred flower.

202
01:26:55,916 --> 01:27:01,912
Together we form a flower,
in search of the sacred water.

203
01:27:03,557 --> 01:27:07,516
This is the moment
when the word is made flesh.

204
01:27:35,122 --> 01:27:37,682
How many people are you?

205
01:27:37,791 --> 01:27:40,021
One, two, three, four, five...

206
01:27:41,495 --> 01:27:42,985
We are nine.

207
01:27:43,096 --> 01:27:45,929
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine...

208
01:27:46,033 --> 01:27:49,264
- One is missing.
- Yes.

209
01:27:58,979 --> 01:28:01,447
Here is the missing one.
He drowned.

210
01:28:16,430 --> 01:28:18,091
He drowned.

211
01:29:03,276 --> 01:29:06,268
This is the ceremony of death.

212
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:09,543
The grave receives you with love.

213
01:29:09,649 --> 01:29:12,277
Surrender yourselves to death.

214
01:29:13,186 --> 01:29:16,747
Return what was loaned to you.

215
01:29:16,857 --> 01:29:20,349
Give up your pleasure, your pains.

216
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:23,827
Give up your friends, your lovers.

217
01:29:23,930 --> 01:29:27,991
Give up your family, your past.

218
01:29:28,101 --> 01:29:32,629
Surrender what you hate,
what you desire.

219
01:29:32,739 --> 01:29:35,230
You will know nothingness -

220
01:29:35,342 --> 01:29:38,175
it is the only reality.

221
01:29:38,278 --> 01:29:42,214
Don't be afraid. It's so easy to give.

222
01:29:42,315 --> 01:29:45,648
You are not alone. You have a grave.

223
01:29:45,752 --> 01:29:48,220
It is your first mother.

224
01:29:48,321 --> 01:29:51,654
The grave is the door to your rebirth.

225
01:29:52,426 --> 01:29:58,729
Now you will surrender the faithful animal
you once called your body.

226
01:29:58,832 --> 01:30:00,823
Don't try to keep it.

227
01:30:00,934 --> 01:30:04,734
Remember, it was a loan.

228
01:30:04,838 --> 01:30:08,274
Surrender your legs, surrender your sex,

229
01:30:08,375 --> 01:30:14,177
your hair, your blood, your organs,
your bones.

230
01:30:14,281 --> 01:30:16,476
You no longer want to possess.

231
01:30:16,583 --> 01:30:19,313
Possession is the ultimate pain.

232
01:30:19,419 --> 01:30:22,252
The earth falls over your corpse.

233
01:30:22,355 --> 01:30:24,880
She comes to cover you with love,

234
01:30:24,991 --> 01:30:28,256
because she is your true flesh.

235
01:30:28,361 --> 01:30:31,228
Now you are an empty heart,

236
01:30:31,331 --> 01:30:35,028
open to receive your truest selves.

237
01:30:35,135 --> 01:30:39,037
Your own perfection, your new body,

238
01:30:39,139 --> 01:30:43,337
which is the universe, the work of God.

239
01:30:43,443 --> 01:30:46,879
You will be born again, you will be real,

240
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:50,381
you will be your own father,
your own mother,

241
01:30:50,484 --> 01:30:53,976
your own child, your own perfection.

242
01:30:54,087 --> 01:30:57,750
Open your eyes. You are the earth,
you are the green,

243
01:30:57,858 --> 01:31:02,420
you are the blue, you are the Aleph,
you are the essence.

244
01:31:02,529 --> 01:31:06,295
Look at the flower.
Look at the flower.

245
01:31:06,399 --> 01:31:10,665
For the first time, look at the flowers.

246
01:31:10,770 --> 01:31:13,603
Now, you are a group.

247
01:32:08,495 --> 01:32:12,363
Do you want to perform
miracles like Christ?

248
01:32:12,465 --> 01:32:15,229
See what would happen if you did.

249
01:33:34,514 --> 01:33:36,982
Concentrate on this starfish.

250
01:33:37,083 --> 01:33:42,919
When you see the size of an elephant,
you will never miss the target.

251
01:33:48,528 --> 01:33:51,019
Our thoughts have forms.

252
01:33:51,131 --> 01:33:54,362
You have a monster in your mind.

253
01:33:54,467 --> 01:33:56,560
We will help you.

254
01:34:48,955 --> 01:34:51,651
Throw the monster into the water.

255
01:35:11,344 --> 01:35:13,812
He can't swim, he will drown.

256
01:35:15,148 --> 01:35:18,515
Fool, destroy your illusions.

257
01:35:19,586 --> 01:35:22,384
Free yourself from the past.

258
01:35:41,608 --> 01:35:45,544
We have crossed the great waters.

259
01:36:17,544 --> 01:36:21,310
Congratulations, you made it to our
shores! This deserves a toast!

260
01:36:21,414 --> 01:36:25,248
You're not the first to come to Lotus
Island in search of the holy mountain.

261
01:36:31,724 --> 01:36:35,660
I drink alone because newcomers
are always abstainers.

262
01:36:35,762 --> 01:36:38,890
In time they realize
that the best liquor in the world

263
01:36:38,998 --> 01:36:40,863
is at the Pantheon Bar.

264
01:36:42,602 --> 01:36:45,799
Come. Come. Come.
I have everything -

265
01:36:45,905 --> 01:36:49,932
food, drinks, beds, baths,
men, women.

266
01:37:25,044 --> 01:37:28,810
These illustrious travelers
came here to find the holy mountain,

267
01:37:28,915 --> 01:37:32,214
but they preferred The Pantheon Bar!

268
01:37:35,889 --> 01:37:38,449
The real holy mountain is here -

269
01:37:38,558 --> 01:37:41,527
in my words, in my poems.

270
01:37:42,328 --> 01:37:46,526
If I write rose, it blooms in my hand,

271
01:37:47,267 --> 01:37:50,964
And the bees come
to feed on my poetry.

272
01:37:55,642 --> 01:37:59,100
Our bees make honey,
but your flies make shit.

273
01:38:05,919 --> 01:38:09,685
The cross was a mushroom.

274
01:38:11,557 --> 01:38:16,688
And the mushroom was also
the tree of good and evil.

275
01:38:17,897 --> 01:38:22,493
The philosophical stone
of the alchemists...

276
01:38:23,469 --> 01:38:27,064
...was LSD.

277
01:38:35,982 --> 01:38:40,316
The book of the dead is a trip,

278
01:38:40,420 --> 01:38:46,552
and the Apocalypse
describes a mescaline experience.

279
01:38:55,068 --> 01:38:57,195
In these flasks...

280
01:38:59,172 --> 01:39:02,630
...are all the holy mountains.

281
01:39:03,943 --> 01:39:07,470
And in this beautiful young man...

282
01:39:08,448 --> 01:39:10,439
...is eternity.

283
01:39:14,287 --> 01:39:16,380
To conquer a mountain is easy.

284
01:39:16,489 --> 01:39:19,356
I can go through solid matter.

285
01:39:24,764 --> 01:39:28,165
Nothing stops me!

286
01:39:28,267 --> 01:39:32,067
In a minute I will cross the holy
mountain. Wait for me here!

287
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:37,375
I got to the other side of the mountain
in less than a minute.

288
01:39:37,477 --> 01:39:43,382
- How long until you reach the summit?
- No, I can only advance horizontally.

289
01:39:43,483 --> 01:39:45,314
That's enough.

290
01:39:45,418 --> 01:39:48,182
From bottom to top, I can't do.

291
01:39:48,287 --> 01:39:50,949
But anyway, I am a champion!

292
01:39:51,057 --> 01:39:53,890
I have conquered
the holy mountain horizontally!

293
01:39:53,993 --> 01:39:57,394
Horizontally! I am a champion!
I am a champion!

294
01:39:57,497 --> 01:39:59,727
I founded the academy.
I give the awards!

295
01:39:59,832 --> 01:40:01,800
Here you can win a trophy every year.

296
01:40:01,901 --> 01:40:05,803
Idiots! You don't know
what you are losing!

297
01:40:05,905 --> 01:40:09,932
You could have made history
and we are already forgetting you!

298
01:40:49,015 --> 01:40:52,678
Help me! I can't go one step farther!

299
01:40:52,785 --> 01:40:56,687
You're not afraid of falling.
What frightens you is climbing.

300
01:40:56,789 --> 01:41:00,589
- Rub your clitoris against the mountain.
- You're terrified of success.

301
01:41:00,693 --> 01:41:02,854
Give yourself to the world!

302
01:41:47,707 --> 01:41:53,168
I can't lie anymore. My hand is frozen.

303
01:41:55,181 --> 01:41:57,843
You were never able to forget
your body,

304
01:41:57,950 --> 01:42:00,748
never able to pry yourself
from that love.

305
01:42:00,853 --> 01:42:04,653
Now the thing you love most
is stopping you from reaching the top.

306
01:42:04,757 --> 01:42:07,419
You must sacrifice part of your body.

307
01:42:11,130 --> 01:42:14,065
Cut off your fingers, or go back!

308
01:42:43,062 --> 01:42:46,361
We have mastered
the difficult part of the mountain.

309
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:50,928
Now the way will be like a garden.

310
01:42:51,037 --> 01:42:56,202
Nevertheless, at this height
our minds will decompose.

311
01:42:56,309 --> 01:42:58,971
And we will suffer the vision of death.

312
01:42:59,078 --> 01:43:04,038
- Lies!
- If you don't believe, wait for us here.

313
01:43:04,150 --> 01:43:08,450
When I return,
I will show you the difficult way.

314
01:47:25,244 --> 01:47:27,542
There are the Immortals!

315
01:47:29,615 --> 01:47:32,550
Meditate here for three hours
before you attack them.

316
01:47:32,651 --> 01:47:34,915
And you?

317
01:47:36,722 --> 01:47:39,953
You don't need a master now.

318
01:47:40,059 --> 01:47:44,792
You can win by yourself. Goodbye.

319
01:47:52,137 --> 01:47:55,538
This is the way we may reach
that summit.

320
01:47:55,641 --> 01:47:57,973
Then we will master our bodies.

321
01:47:59,845 --> 01:48:01,972
You know now what you must do.

322
01:48:02,081 --> 01:48:06,017
You don't need anyone,
you are a master.

323
01:48:07,219 --> 01:48:09,210
Cut off my head.

324
01:48:42,955 --> 01:48:45,515
Now you can begin to learn.

325
01:48:57,570 --> 01:49:00,733
Unite yourself with this good woman,

326
01:49:00,839 --> 01:49:04,297
who came here only
because she loves you.

327
01:49:08,647 --> 01:49:13,641
Forget the summits,
reach eternity through love.

328
01:49:13,752 --> 01:49:16,152
Return to your country.

329
01:49:16,255 --> 01:49:20,555
I leave you my tower
and my alchemical rooms.

330
01:49:20,659 --> 01:49:23,219
This is your family and your people.

331
01:49:23,329 --> 01:49:25,160
Change the world.

332
01:50:12,811 --> 01:50:14,642
Sit down.

333
01:50:25,357 --> 01:50:29,657
I promised you the great secret
and I will not disappoint you.

334
01:50:38,704 --> 01:50:41,537
Is this the end of our adventure?

335
01:50:41,640 --> 01:50:43,733
Nothing has an end.

336
01:50:44,710 --> 01:50:48,202
We came in search
of the secret of immortality.

337
01:50:48,313 --> 01:50:50,645
To be like gods.

338
01:50:50,749 --> 01:50:54,082
And here we are... mortals.

339
01:50:54,186 --> 01:50:56,654
More human than ever.

340
01:50:57,756 --> 01:51:00,953
If we have not obtained immortality,

341
01:51:01,060 --> 01:51:04,325
at least we have obtained reality.

342
01:51:04,430 --> 01:51:09,094
We began in a fairytale
and we came to life!

343
01:51:09,201 --> 01:51:13,501
But is this life reality?

344
01:51:13,605 --> 01:51:15,266
No.

345
01:51:15,374 --> 01:51:20,311
It is a film. Zoom back camera.

346
01:51:27,486 --> 01:51:32,822
We are images, dreams, photographs.

347
01:51:33,926 --> 01:51:36,656
We must not stay here!

348
01:51:36,762 --> 01:51:38,593
Prisoners!

349
01:51:38,697 --> 01:51:41,598
We shall break the illusion.

350
01:51:41,700 --> 01:51:44,191
This is Maya.

351
01:51:52,211 --> 01:51:54,941
Goodbye to the holy mountain.

352
01:51:55,047 --> 01:51:57,914
Real life awaits us.
