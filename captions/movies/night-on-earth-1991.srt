01:50:33,670 --> 01:50:35,570
Finally the doctor came and told me

1371
01:50:35,772 --> 01:50:37,797
that Eija had a baby.

1372
01:50:38,675 --> 01:50:43,511
She was all right, and the
baby, a little girl, was alive.

1373
01:50:44,581 --> 01:50:46,845
I was so happy I was about to explode.

1374
01:50:47,718 --> 01:50:50,551
A little daughter.
Ya.

1375
01:50:52,189 --> 01:50:54,020
But the doctor looked worried.

1376
01:50:54,958 --> 01:50:57,257
He told me the baby was way too early.

1377
01:50:58,463 --> 01:51:02,160
So far she was okay, but
she was in an incubator.

1378
01:51:03,568 --> 01:51:04,830
And then he said

1379
01:51:06,404 --> 01:51:09,100
there was almost no
chance the baby would live.

1380
01:51:16,916 --> 01:51:18,213
So what happened?

1381
01:51:21,220 --> 01:51:24,884
The next day I brought my
wife home from the hospital,

1382
01:51:25,826 --> 01:51:28,420
but the baby stayed
there in the incubator.

1383
01:51:30,263 --> 01:51:31,753
You should have seen her though.

1384
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:35,063
So tiny and perfect.

1385
01:51:35,802 --> 01:51:37,896
Tiny hands, tiny feet.

1386
01:51:39,774 --> 01:51:42,937
She was shaped like a little peanut.

1387
01:51:49,784 --> 01:51:52,219
But the doctor didn't give us much hope.

1388
01:51:53,188 --> 01:51:56,419
He said she wouldn't
live more than a week,

1389
01:51:56,692 --> 01:51:58,284
our tiny daughter.

1390
01:51:59,628 --> 01:52:02,461
Eija was so scared that
she was about to go crazy.

1391
01:52:03,132 --> 01:52:04,599
So I made a big decision.

1392
01:52:05,634 --> 01:52:08,934
I decided that I wouldn't
love this tiny little child.

1393
01:52:10,106 --> 01:52:14,133
If she was going to die, I would
have to stay strong and distant.

1394
01:52:14,611 --> 01:52:18,445
I couldn't stand the
pain of losing this child.

1395
01:52:20,317 --> 01:52:23,343
So I decided to kill my love.

1396
01:52:32,029 --> 01:52:35,090
A week went by, and the baby lived.

1397
01:52:39,137 --> 01:52:42,868
Then another week went
by, and part of a third.

1398
01:52:44,342 --> 01:52:47,607
After three entire weeks
the child was still alive.

1399
01:52:48,314 --> 01:52:50,714
But the doctor was still very negative.

1400
01:52:51,384 --> 01:52:53,249
That started to make me angry.

1401
01:52:54,120 --> 01:52:56,486
I sat up all night in the kitchen

1402
01:52:57,023 --> 01:52:59,150
while my poor wife lay
awake in the bedroom.

1403
01:53:01,694 --> 01:53:04,493
And I sat there, just as
the dawn was about to break.

1404
01:53:05,766 --> 01:53:08,496
The light outside was
just like it is right now.

1405
01:53:09,970 --> 01:53:13,531
Then Eija came to me and
said I'd made a mistake.

1406
01:53:14,975 --> 01:53:16,466
I realized she was right.

1407
01:53:17,212 --> 01:53:20,739
If that baby was going to
make it, it needed all my love.

1408
01:53:21,516 --> 01:53:23,279
The strongest love possible.

1409
01:53:24,919 --> 01:53:26,443
It was a relief.

1410
01:53:26,888 --> 01:53:34,125
I felt my love for that baby surge
through every pore of my worthless body.

1411
01:53:37,333 --> 01:53:39,927
I felt so happy and clear.

1412
01:53:41,136 --> 01:53:43,696
That little peanut was our child

1413
01:53:45,208 --> 01:53:47,472
and we cried out of happiness.

1414
01:53:48,478 --> 01:53:51,345
We tried to eat some
breakfast, but we couldn't.

1415
01:53:55,151 --> 01:53:56,948
Then we drove to the hospital.

1416
01:53:58,089 --> 01:54:01,855
We wanted that baby to feel
all the strength of our love.

1417
01:54:05,863 --> 01:54:07,160
At the hospital

1418
01:54:07,265 --> 01:54:09,495
the doctor was right there to meet us.

1419
01:54:10,534 --> 01:54:12,469
His face was very serious.

1420
01:54:13,338 --> 01:54:15,101
He took us aside.

1421
01:54:17,609 --> 01:54:20,442
And then he told us that
a short time earlier,

1422
01:54:20,545 --> 01:54:22,308
just before sunrise,

1423
01:54:22,481 --> 01:54:24,039
the baby had died.

1424
01:54:24,416 --> 01:54:28,717
Nothing could be done.
It was too late...
