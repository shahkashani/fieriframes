942
01:33:18,859 --> 01:33:20,827
I'm vegetarian.

943
01:33:21,963 --> 01:33:23,988
You eat cheese?

944
01:33:24,098 --> 01:33:26,896
Yeah, sometimes.
l-I like cheese.

945
01:33:28,235 --> 01:33:30,703
Okay, I got it.
I'll be right back.

946
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:36,904
<i>[Door Opens, Closes]</i>

947
01:33:47,054 --> 01:33:48,954
Thanks.
You're welcome.

948
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:21,688
Hey.

949
01:34:22,857 --> 01:34:25,519
You found us a place.

950
01:34:25,626 --> 01:34:27,719
All right.

951
01:34:31,098 --> 01:34:33,328
Let's see here.

952
01:34:33,434 --> 01:34:36,232
Big cheese and veggie sandwich...

953
01:34:36,370 --> 01:34:38,304
with mushrooms.

954
01:34:40,207 --> 01:34:42,107
Fries-
Mmm.

955
01:34:42,209 --> 01:34:44,143
extra large.

956
01:34:47,782 --> 01:34:49,750
Two waters.

957
01:34:52,653 --> 01:34:54,621
Two coffees.

958
01:35:03,197 --> 01:35:05,893
My mom put that there...

959
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,968
<i>for good luck.</i>

960
01:35:12,606 --> 01:35:15,006
Thanks for the food.

961
01:35:15,109 --> 01:35:17,407
Ahh.
No problem, chief.

962
01:35:21,749 --> 01:35:23,717
You called me chief?

963
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:28,088
Yeah. Why?

964
01:35:33,894 --> 01:35:35,862
What happened to your eye?

965
01:35:37,698 --> 01:35:39,666
I, uh-

966
01:35:41,469 --> 01:35:43,869
I ran into somebody.

967
01:35:44,004 --> 01:35:46,472
Somebody's fist.

968
01:35:48,309 --> 01:35:51,244
You a gangster?

969
01:35:51,345 --> 01:35:53,245
No. I wish.

970
01:35:53,347 --> 01:35:56,976
No, I was, uh-
I was in computers.

971
01:35:58,652 --> 01:36:00,620
Computers and girls.

972
01:36:02,656 --> 01:36:04,556
What about you, chief?

973
01:36:04,658 --> 01:36:07,684
I'm interested
in, uh, philosophy.

974
01:36:09,964 --> 01:36:11,932
Philosophy and girls.

975
01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:18,004
Sounds pretty good.

976
01:36:19,273 --> 01:36:21,707
Think so?

977
01:36:28,415 --> 01:36:30,383
So, uh,

978
01:36:32,052 --> 01:36:36,011
as just a guy
who gave another guy a sandwich,

979
01:36:38,759 --> 01:36:43,219
you have any, like,
philosophical tips or anything...

980
01:36:44,999 --> 01:36:48,093
for a guy on a kind of road trip?

981
01:36:49,170 --> 01:36:51,661
You asking me?

982
01:36:53,274 --> 01:36:55,208
Yeah.

983
01:36:56,343 --> 01:36:58,277
Well-

984
01:37:01,749 --> 01:37:04,479
The past is gone.

985
01:37:04,585 --> 01:37:06,553
I know that.

986
01:37:07,922 --> 01:37:10,584
The future...

987
01:37:10,691 --> 01:37:12,750
isn't here yet,

988
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:14,828
whatever it's going to be.

989
01:37:16,363 --> 01:37:18,263
So,

990
01:37:18,365 --> 01:37:22,426
all there is is-
is this.

991
01:37:23,838 --> 01:37:25,772
The present.

992
01:37:31,812 --> 01:37:33,780
That's it.

993
01:37:36,150 --> 01:37:38,118
Are you a Buddhist?

994
01:37:40,187 --> 01:37:42,155
No. Are you?

995
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:45,659
Uh, I'm not sure yet.

996
01:37:47,094 --> 01:37:51,497
I'm sorry that's the best
I have to offer at the moment.

997
01:37:51,599 --> 01:37:53,567
No, I appreciate it.

998
01:37:54,735 --> 01:37:57,203
I like what you said.

999
01:37:58,439 --> 01:38:01,806
It's better than some, like,

1000
01:38:01,942 --> 01:38:04,069
fatherly-sounding bullshit.

1001
01:38:07,448 --> 01:38:09,348
Is that...

1002
01:38:09,450 --> 01:38:11,577
what your father's like?

1003
01:38:18,325 --> 01:38:21,726
Ah, that's not a good subject.

1004
01:38:21,829 --> 01:38:24,730
Hey, I gotta go, man.
I'm sorry.

1005
01:38:24,832 --> 01:38:27,392
Thanks again
for the sandwich and stuff.

1006
01:38:27,501 --> 01:38:29,492
Hold on a second.
Wait.

1007
01:38:31,972 --> 01:38:35,533
I know you think
that I'm your father, don't you?

1008
01:38:37,711 --> 01:38:41,112
What?
Just tell me.
You can talk to me, chief.

1009
01:38:41,215 --> 01:38:43,479
Man, you're fucked up.

1010
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:46,212
Wait a second.
Wait a second. Wait!
