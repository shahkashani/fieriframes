I'm voting for Dukakis.

23
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,810
Hmm.

24
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,937
Well.

25
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:35,025
Maybe when you have children
of your own who need braces,

26
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,112
and you can't afford them because
half your husband's paycheck

27
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:40,322
goes to the federal government,

28
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:43,409
- you'll regret that.
- My "husband's paycheck"?

29
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:49,456
Anyway, I'm not gonna squeeze
one out till I'm, like, 30.

30
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:53,002
Will you still be working at the Yarn Barn?
Because I hear it's a really

31
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:55,963
- great place to raise children.
- That's really funny.

32
00:04:56,088 --> 00:05:00,342
No, a year of partying's enough.
She'll be going to Harvard next fall.

33
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,428
Mum, I haven't even gotten in yet.

34
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:06,390
You honestly think Dukakis will provide for
this country till you squeeze one out?

35
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,559
Yeah. I do.

36
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:12,980
- Can I squeeze one out?
- Not till eighth grade.

37
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:14,565
Excuse me.

38
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:17,943
Donnie, you're such a dick.

39
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:19,486
Whoa, Elizabeth.

40
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,323
A little hostile there.

41
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:27,619
Mum and Dad should pay a therapist
$200 an hour to listen to you

42
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,496
so we don't have to.

43
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:34,126
OK. Wanna tell Mum and Dad why
you stopped taking your medication?

44
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,254
- You're such a fuck-ass.
- What?!

45
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:40,674
- Please.
- Did he call me a fuck-ass?

46
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,885
- Hey, Sweetie.
- That's enough.

47
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:46,638
- You can go suck a fuck.
- How does one do that?

48
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:48,474
- Want me to tell you?
- Please, tell me.

49
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:51,185
We will not have this
at the dinner table.

50
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,354
Stop!

51
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:07,326
- What's a fuck-ass?

52
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,127
I'm reading.
Get out of my room.

53
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,425
Where do you go at night?

54
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,553
Will you just get out of my room?

55
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,472
Did you toilet-paper
the Johnsons' house?

56
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:31,350
- You came to ask me that?
- No.

57
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:35,020
I stopped rolling houses
in sixth grade, Mum.

58
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:39,358
What happened to my son?
I don't recognise this person today.

59
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,902
Then why don't you start
taking the goddamn pills!

60
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,498
Bitch.

61
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:05,426
Our son just called me a bitch.

62
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,389
You're not a bitch.

63
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:15,436
You're bitching, but you're not a bitch.

64
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,018
'I want to be a president of
the Unites States who makes sure

'we never again do business
with a Panamanian dictator.

- 'That we never again funnel aid...'
- Dukakis.

67
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:07,196
- Son of a bitch.
- 'Panama is a friendly country.

68
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,449
- 'I talked to Panamas president...'
- Tell him, George!

Why?

81
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,391
Son?

82
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,976
Son? Donnie Darko?

83
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:27,229
Donnie Darko?

84
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,648
- What the heck's going on?
- Who is it, Don?

85
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:33,902
It's Eddie Darko's kid. I'm sorry
about this. He's just a neighbourhood kid.

86
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:38,573
- Guess he was sleep-golfing.

87
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:41,284
Watch out for that drool spot.

88
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,497
Are you all right, son?

89
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:55,882
So...
Let's stay off the links at night, OK?

I'm sorry, Dr Fisher.
It won't happen again.

- I hate kids.
- Let's golf.

Donnie! Donnie! Donnie!

93
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,945
What happened to your house?

94
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:22,826
- No-one's allowed through...
- This is my house!

95

He's OK.

00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:31,334
Donnie, we know you're OK!

Channel 6 News.
We have just arrived on the scene...

98
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,982
Wait a minute. Here's your brother.

99
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,860
- Oh!
- It fell in your room.

100
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,738
Watch yourself down there!

101
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:21,593
Mrs Darko?
I'm Bob Garland. I'm with the FAA.

102
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,513
- You're what?
- I'm with the FAA.

103
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:27,474
If you don't mind, we'd like to speak
to you and Mr Darko privately.

104
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,768
- In private?
- Please.

105
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:33,313
All right.

106
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:42,322
You see that little red thing in there?

107
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,539
And... here.

108
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,791
- You got it.
- All right.

109
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:57,003
We have arranged for you
to stay at a hotel, get some sleep.

110
00:13:57,087 --> 00:14:00,841
- We will take care of things here.
- Thank you.

111
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:03,468
Kids, we're going to a hotel.

112
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:06,137

You remember him?

117
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:33,999
From high school.

118
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,460
Hmm.

119
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,714
He died.

120
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:45,969
- On his way to the prom.
- Mm.

121
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,138
- Remember?
- Mm-hm.

122
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:53,018
They said he was doomed.

123
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:55,687
Mm.

124

Jesus.

125
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:04,362
They could have said the same thing
about Donnie.

126
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:13,580
If it fell from a plane,
then what happened to the plane?

127
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:17,334
They don't know, Samantha.

128
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:31,473
Mrs Farmer will bring you home
after practice. Bye, honey.

129
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:34,309
Donnie. Good luck.

130
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,811
Oh, my God.
OK, tell me everything.

131
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:39,856
- I'm not allowed to talk about it.
- Oh, my God.

132
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,026
- Hi, Cherita.
- Shut up.

133

Darko cheats death, uh?

134
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,948
You're like a celebrity, man.

135
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:50,283
I've been calling you a gillion times.
Where you been?

136
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,243
We stayed at a hotel.

137
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:56,247
My dad saw you at the golf course.
You sleepwalking again now buddy?

138
00:15:56,373 --> 00:16:01,753
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Now you're famous, have a smoke.

139
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,759
What happens if you tell
Mum and Dad about this, Sam?

140
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,845
You'll put Ariel
in the garbage disposal.

141
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:14,724
- Goddamn right I will.
- So grody.

142
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,519
Hey, Cherita. You want a cigarette?

143

- Shut up!
- Shut up!

144
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,691
Go back to China, bitch.

145
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:27,278
Just leave her alone.

146
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:28,905

147
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,242

"There would be headlines

What is Graham Greene trying
to communicate with this passage?

179
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:38,595
Why did the children break into
Old Misery's house?

180
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,557
- Joanie?
- They wanted to rob him.

181
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,560
Joanie, if you had actually
read the short story,

182
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:48,563
which at a whooping 13 pages
would have kept you up all night,

183
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:53,234
you would know that the children find a
great deal of money in the mattress,

184
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:55,695
but they burn it.

185
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,366
Donnie Darko,

186
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,286
perhaps with your recent brush
with mass destruction

187
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,663
you can give us your opinion.

188
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:10,126
Well, they say when they flood
the house and tear it to shreds

189
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,962
that destruction is a form of creation,

190
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:16,174
so the fact that they burn the money
is ironic.

191
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,678
They just want to see what happens
when they tear the world apart.

192
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:22,639
They wanna change things.

193
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,730
May we help you?

194
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:35,068
I just registered. They put me
in the wrong English class.

195
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:37,528
You look like you belong here.

196
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:41,032
Um, where do I sit?

197
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:47,205
Sit next to the boy
you think is the cutest.

198
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:52,168
- Quiet. Let her choose.

199
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,065
Joanie, get up.

200
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:41,009
Well, the construction guys
say it'll take a week to fix the roof.

201
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:44,012
That airline better not fuck us
on the shingle match.

202
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:48,266
- They still don't know?
- Know what?

203
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:50,601
Where it came from.

204
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:53,771
No. Apparently they can't tell us
what happened yet.

205
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:58,860
Something about a matching
serial number that got burned.

206
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:04,240
I had to sign a form saying
I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.

207
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:07,660
We're not supposed to tell anyone
what nobody knows?

208
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,579
Yeah.

209
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:14,083
But you tell...
What's your doctor's name?

210
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,502
- Dr Thurman, Dad.
- Yes.

211
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:19,422
You tell Dr Thurman
whatever you want.

212
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,591
- Dad.
- What?

213
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:23,301
Dad!

214
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:48,451
No mail today. Maybe tomorrow.

215
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:07,595
Well, what did she say to you?

216
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:18,272
- I made a new friend.
- Real or imaginary?

217
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:20,149
Imaginary.

218
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:21,984
Would you like to talk
about this friend?

219
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:25,405
- Frank.
- Frank.

220
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:28,658
- What did Frank say?
- He said to follow him.

221
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,868
- Follow him where?
- Into the future.

222
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:34,497
And then what happens?

223
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:38,376
And then he said...

224
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:42,755
Then he said the world
is coming to an end.

225
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,049
Do you think
it's coming to an end?

226
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:52,557
No.

227
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,060
That's stupid.

228
00:23:57,728 --> 00:24:01,732
'For my entire life
I was a victim of my own fear.'

229
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:05,027
'Love!

230
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:09,198
'I was feeding fear through food.'

231
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,455
'Fear.'

232
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,297
'And finally I looked in the mirror.

233
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:28,968
'Not just in the mirror.
I looked through the mirror.

234
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:33,389
'In that image
I saw my ego reflection.'

235
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,854
'I thought ten-year-olds
normally wet the bed...'

236
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,815
Shh!

237
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:49,822
'The solution was there all the time.'

238
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:52,658
'I'm not afraid any more!'

239
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:58,789
'All over America, people have
come together to join hands.

00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:06,547

is absolutely too important,

241
00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:11,969

I can't believe it!

248
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:25,126
The school is closed today
because it's flooded.

249
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,295
- No way.
- Yeah.

250
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:30,381
Holy shit! That's the best news
I've ever heard.

251
00:26:37,013 --> 00:26:40,016
My God. Is this ever gonna stop?

252
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:44,937
Eventually, yes. But I've got
12 classrooms full of water,

253
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:47,898
all coming from a busted water main.

254
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:51,110
- What else?
- What else?!

255
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:53,946
Principal Cole, I'll show you what else.

256
00:26:57,033 --> 00:27:00,453
That's unbelievable.
That's solid bronze, isn't it?

257
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:02,371
How did this happen?

258
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:07,335
The boys' locker room was flooded.
They found faeces everywhere.

259
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:10,338
- What are faeces?
- Baby mice.

260
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:31,108
Hey.

261
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:34,445
Has anyone ever told you
that you're sexy?

262
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:37,573
- I like your boobs.

263
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:39,116
Hey.

264
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,370
Hey.

265
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:44,538
School's cancelled.

266
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,918
Do you want to walk me home?

267
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:51,754
Sure.

268
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:02,682
- Don't look so freaked.
- I'm not.

269
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:06,477
Check your backpack.
Those guys love to steal shit.

270
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:13,943
- So, why did you move here?
- My parents got a divorce.

271
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:17,363
My mum had to get a restraining order
against my stepdad.

272
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:22,493
- He has emotional problems.
- Me too. What kind does he have?

273
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:25,871
He stabbed my mum
four times in the chest.

274
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:29,709
Oh. Did he go to jail?

275
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:33,504
No, he fled. They still can't find him,

276
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:39,093
but my mum and I had to change our names.
I thought Gretchen Ross was cool.

277
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:41,429
I was in jail once.

278
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:44,306
I mean... I accidentally
burned down this house.

279
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:46,517
It was abandoned, but still...

280
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,938
I got held back in school,
I can't drive till I'm 21, you know.

281
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:53,607
But I'm over all of that. I...

282
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:57,403
I'm painting and stuff. Writing.

283
00:28:57,486 --> 00:29:01,407
I want to be a writer. Maybe a painter,
I don't know. Maybe both.

284
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:04,827
I'll write a book and draw the pictures.

285
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:08,456
Then maybe people will
understand me. Change things.

286
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:10,416
Donnie Darko?

287
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:15,254
What the hell kind of name is that?
It's like some sort of superhero.

288
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:17,465
What makes you think I'm not?

289
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:24,013
Look, I should go.

290
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,932
For Physics, Monnitoff wants me
to write this essay.

291
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:30,060
Greatest invention
ever to benefit mankind.

292
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:36,358
If it's Monnitoff, that's easy.
Antiseptics.

293
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:40,780
The whole sanitation thing.
Joseph Lister, 1895.

294
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:43,073
Before antiseptics
there was no sanitation.

295
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:46,827
- Especially in medicine.
- You mean soap?

296
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:56,754
I'm really glad
school was flooded today.

297
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:58,923
Why's that?

298
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:02,092
You and I would never
have had this conversation.

299
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:06,472
You're weird.

300
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:08,265
Sorry.

301
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:10,851
No, that was a compliment.

302
00:30:14,522 --> 00:30:16,732
Well, look, um...

303
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:20,611
You wanna go with me?

304
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:24,824
Where do you wanna go?

305
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:30,246
I mean, like, go with me. You know...
That's what we call it here.

306
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:32,581
- Going together...
- Sure.

307
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:38,629
OK. Where are you going?

308
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:42,633
I'm going home.

309
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:48,806
So stupid! Where are you going?

310
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:01,944
I'd like to try something new this time.

311
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:06,657
Have you ever been hypnotised?

312
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,286
No.

313
00:31:18,878 --> 00:31:23,007
When I clap my hands twice, you
will wake up. Do you understand?

314
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:24,842
Yes.

315
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:29,179
So, tell me about your week.

316
00:31:29,263 --> 00:31:30,931
I met a girl.

317
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:37,438
- What is her name?
- Gretchen.

318
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:41,442
We're going together now.

319
00:31:43,444 --> 00:31:46,405
Do you still think about girls a lot?

320
00:31:47,156 --> 00:31:48,866
Yeah.

321
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:54,413
How are things going at school?

322
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:58,000
I think about girls a lot.

323
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,711
I asked you about school, Donnie.

324
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:04,465
I think about fucking
a lot during school.

325
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:08,636
What else do you think about
during school?

326
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:12,640
- "Married With Children."
- Do you think about your family?

327
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:17,811
I just turn down the volume and think
about fucking Christina Applegate.

328
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:20,731
I asked you about your family,
Donnie.

329
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:22,900
No.

330
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:26,695
I don't think about fucking my family.
That's gross.

331
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:30,491
I'd like to hear
about your friend Frank.

332
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,551
Sam Bylen.

333
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:09,279
Donald Darko.

334
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:34,805
Daye Dennis.

335
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:42,438
Hey, you fuck.

336
00:33:42,563 --> 00:33:45,107
Did you tell them I flooded the school?

337
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:51,530
- I didn't say shit.
- They think I did it.

338
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:54,783
If you're innocent, then
you have nothing to worry about.

339
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:58,537
Fuck you!
You know what I think?

340
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,708
I think you did it.

341
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,976
Beer and pussy. That's all I need.

342
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,520
We gotta find ourselves a Smurfette.

343
00:34:23,604 --> 00:34:25,731
- Smurfette?
- Mm-hm.

344
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:28,650
Not some tight-assed
Middlesex chick.

345
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:32,154
A cute little blonde that'll get
down and dirty with the guys.

346
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:36,408
- Like Smurfette does.
- Smurfette doesn't fuck.

347
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:42,206
Smurfette fucks the other smurfs.
Why did Papa Smurf make her?

348
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:45,250
Because all the other smurfs
were getting too horny.

349
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:48,087
Not Vanity.
I heard he was a homosexual.

350
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:52,466
OK, she fucks them
while Vanity watches. OK?

351
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:56,303
What about Papa Smurf?
He must get in on the action.

352
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:58,931
Yeah. When he does, he films the gangbang.

353
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:01,934
Later on, he beats off to the tape.

354
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:07,689
First of all, Papa Smurf didn't create
Smurfette. Gargamel did.

355
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:12,319
She was sent in as Gargamel's evil spy,
to destroy the smurf village.

356
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:16,782
But the overwhelming goodness
of the smurf way of life transformed her.

357
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:19,535
And as for
the whole gangbang scenario,

358
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:22,162
it just couldn't happen.

359
00:35:22,246 --> 00:35:25,374
Smurfs are asexual.
They don't even have...

360
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:28,836
reproductive organs
under those little white pants.

361
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:34,174
That's what's so illogical, you know,
about being a smurf.

362
00:35:34,258 --> 00:35:36,927
What's the point of living

363
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,263
if you don't have a dick?

364
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:45,936
Dammit, Donnie, why you gotta get
so smart on us?

365
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:49,273
- Grandma Death.

366
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:52,317
Excuse me! Excuse me!

367
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:58,615
Stay off the road, Miss Sparrow.
I'll have to call social services.

368
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:02,536
I hate that Miss Farmer.
She's such a fucking bitch.

369
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,621
Yeah.

370
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:08,250
- How old is Grandma Death?
- 101.

371
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:12,421
She does the same thing every day.

372
00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:17,259
Just walks back and forth,
back and forth to the mailbox.

373
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:22,055
And nothing ever in there.

374
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:26,435
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

375
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:30,772
She's going back to the box.

376
00:36:30,898 --> 00:36:32,649
We may still have mail.

377
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:35,152
- Mail, mail, mail.
- Here it is.

378
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:38,322
This could be it. Oh!

379
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:41,074
No dice, Grandma.
No, sorry.

380
00:36:41,158 --> 00:36:43,327
Someone ought to write that bitch.

381
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:45,704
'Authorities
continued their search

382
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:48,999
'for a suspect
in the school vandalism.

383
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:53,754
'The school has asked for donations
to help restore its mascot,

384
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:56,298
'known only as the Mongrel.'

385
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:04,598
In cooperation with the county police,

386
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:09,186
we have begun investigating
the cause of the flooding

387
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:12,731
and our suspects include
several of our own students.

388
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:17,402
I want to know why this filth
is being taught to our children.

389
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:30,749
Kitty, I would appreciate
if you would wait...

390
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:34,711
Dr Cole, not only am I a teacher,

391
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:38,215
but I am also a parent
of a Middlesex child.

392
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:43,887
Therefore, I am the only person here who
transcends the parent-teacher bridge.

393
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:49,601
'Don't worry.

394
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:52,312
'You got away with it.'

395
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:55,899
I have in my hand
Graham Greene's "The Destructors."

396
00:37:56,024 --> 00:38:00,779
This short story is part of
my daughter's English assignment.

397
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:05,409
In this story, several children
destroy an elderly man's house

398
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:07,369
from inside out.

399
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:22,551
How can you do that?

400
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:31,935
And how do they do this?

401
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:36,898
They flood the house
by breaking through a water main.

402
00:38:38,025 --> 00:38:41,111
'I can do anything I want.

403
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:44,156
'And so can you.'

404
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:47,576
We pay good money for this school
It's our children.

405
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:51,288
And I think that this garbage
should be removed.

406
00:38:51,413 --> 00:38:53,165
Excuse me.

407
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:56,084
What's the real issue here?
The PTA doesn't ban books.

408
00:38:56,293 --> 00:39:02,424
The PTA is here to acknowledge
that pornography is being taught.

409
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:08,180
- It's meant to be ironic.
- You need to go back to grad school.

410
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:10,682
Why did you make me
flood the school?

411
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,023
They are in great danger.

412
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:21,443
Kitty, do you even know
who Graham Greene is?

413
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:24,821
I think we have all seen "Bonanza."

414
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:32,120
Well, uh...
while we are on other topics...

415
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:34,456
Where did you come from?

416
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:38,668
Do you believe in time travel?

417
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:43,507
Who are you talking to?

418
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:49,763
I was just taking my pills, Sam.

419
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,983
'It is time to breathe.'

420
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,486
'Thank you, Jim Cunningham.'

421
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:07,697
'Thank you, Jim Cunningham.'

422
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:12,160
'So, now let us begin
lifeline exercise No.1.

423
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:14,538
'Please press stop now.'

424
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:27,300
As you can see, the lifeline is divided
into two polar extremes.

425
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:29,803
Fear and love.

426
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:33,765
Fear is in
the negative energy spectrum

427
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:37,394
and love is in
the positive energy spectrum.

428
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:39,771
- Duh!
- Excuse me?

429
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:43,733
"Duh" is a product of fear.

430
00:40:44,985 --> 00:40:49,573
Now, on each card
is a character dilemma

431
00:40:49,698 --> 00:40:52,242
which applies to the lifeline.

432
00:40:54,578 --> 00:40:57,080
Please... Take this.

433
00:40:57,164 --> 00:40:59,040
Thank you.

434
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:02,002
Please read
each character dilemma aloud

435
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:06,631
and place an X on the lifeline
in the appropriate place.

436
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:08,717
Cherita?

437
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:20,061
"Juanita has an important math test
today.

438
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:24,566
"She has known about the test for
several weeks but has not studied.

439
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:28,028
"In order to keep from failing her class,

440
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:32,073
"Juanita decides that she will cheat
on the math test."

441
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:37,662
Good. Good. Very good.

442
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:40,081
Um, Mr Darko.

443
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:50,467
"Ling Ling finds a wallet
on the ground, filled with money.

444
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:55,430
"She takes the wallet to the address
inside but keeps the money."

445
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:59,309
I'm sorry, Miss Farmer.
I don't get this.

446
00:41:59,518 --> 00:42:02,521
Just place an X on the lifeline
in the appropriate place.

447
00:42:02,646 --> 00:42:06,024
No, I know what to do. I don't get this.

448
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:08,735
You can't lump things
into two categories.

449
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:12,489
The lifeline is divided that way.

450
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:14,199
Well, life isn't that simple.

451
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:18,495
Who cares if Ling Ling returns
the wallet and keeps the money?

452
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:21,331
It has nothing to do with
either fear or love.

453
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:24,000
Fear and love
are the deepest of human emotions.

454
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:26,753
OK. But you're not listening to me.

455
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:29,631
There are other things that need
to be taken into account here.

456
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:32,676
Like the whole spectrum
of human emotion.

457
00:42:32,801 --> 00:42:37,347
You can't lump everything into two
categories and deny everything else.

458
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:41,643
If you don't complete the assignment,
you'll get a zero for the day.

459
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:48,191
Donald.

460
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:51,861
Let me preface this by saying
that your Iowa Test scores

461
00:42:51,945 --> 00:42:55,740
are... intimidating.

462
00:42:57,826 --> 00:43:01,663
So... let's go over this again.

463
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:05,166
What exactly did you say
to Mrs Farmer?

464
00:43:07,586 --> 00:43:09,546
I'll tell you what he said.

465
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:13,592
He asked me to forcibly insert
the lifeline exercise card into my anus.

466
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:24,519
These are modern times.
My political attitudes are forthright.

467
00:43:24,603 --> 00:43:30,317
If there's a vice presidential candidate
worthy of my vote, it has to be Dan Quayle.

468
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:35,071
Nobody cares about responsibility,
morality, family values...

469
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:41,036
Kitty...

470
00:43:41,161 --> 00:43:42,954
Excuse us, please.

471
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:51,087
They've suspended him from after-school
activities for the next six months.

472
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:58,720
Ever since this jet engine fiasco
I don't know what's gotten into him.

473
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:03,266
Rose, our daughters have been on
the dance team together for two years

474
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:05,393
and I respect you as a woman.

475
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:10,815
But after witnessing your son's
behaviour, I have doubts about your...

476
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:15,320
Our paths through life
must be righteous.

477
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:18,573
I urge you to go home
and look in the mirror,

478
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:22,369
and pray that your son
doesn't succumb to the path of fear.

479
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:32,545
Do you remember
that weird gym teacher Mrs Farmer?

480
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:35,382
Yeah.

481
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:39,427
OK, my brother told her to shove
a book up her ass today.

482
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:43,515
And then my parents just bought him
all this new shit.

483
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:47,769
I know. I wish a jet engine
would fall in my room.

484
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:53,149
'I can show you the way.'

485
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:01,533
Yeah.

486
00:45:05,662 --> 00:45:07,831
- Dr Monnitoff?
- Donnie.

487
00:45:07,914 --> 00:45:11,668
Um, I know this is gonna sound
kinda weird, but uh...

488
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:16,047
do you know anything
about time travel?

489
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:24,431
Ah! A wormhole
with an Einstein-Rosen bridge,

490
00:45:24,514 --> 00:45:29,811
which is theoretically a wormhole
in space controlled by man.

491
00:45:32,188 --> 00:45:34,816
So, according to Hawking,

492
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:38,236
a wormhole may be able
to provide a short cut

493
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:41,322
for jumping between
two distant regions of space time.

494
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:43,074
So in order to travel
back in time,

495
00:45:43,158 --> 00:45:46,619
you have to have a big spaceship
that can travel faster than light.

496
00:45:46,703 --> 00:45:49,873
- Theoretically.
- And be able to find a wormhole.

497
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:52,250
The basic principles
of time travel are there.

498
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:54,419
You've got your vessel and your portal,

499
00:45:54,544 --> 00:45:57,172
and your vessel can be
just about anything. Probably a spacecraft.

500
00:45:57,297 --> 00:45:59,966
- Like a DeLorean.
- Any metal craft.

501
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:06,055
I love that movie, the way they shot it.
It's so... like futuristic, you know.

502
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:11,144
Listen... don't tell anybody
that I gave you this.

503
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:13,980
The woman who wrote this
used to teach here.

504
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:17,400
She was a nun
many years before that.

505
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:22,363
Then overnight she became
this entirely different person.

506
00:46:22,489 --> 00:46:25,950
She up and left the church,
she wrote this book.

507
00:46:26,201 --> 00:46:28,286
She started teaching science.

508
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:30,455
Right here in Middlesex.

509
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:33,750
"The Philosophy of Time Travel."

510
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:37,295
Roberta Sparrow?

511
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:39,464
That's right.

512
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:41,841
Come on.

513
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:44,886
Roberta Sparrow.

514
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:06,533
Roberta Sparrow...

515
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:10,203
Grandma Death.

516
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:13,790
It's called
"The Philosophy of Time Travel."

517
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:17,460
What does philosophy
have to do with time travel?

518
00:47:17,544 --> 00:47:21,297
- Let me see.
- Guess who wrote it.

519
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:23,424
Roberta Sparrow?

520
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,635
Huh! She wrote a book!

521
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,929
Grandma Death wrote a book.

522
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:30,640
That's a terrible nickname.

523
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:33,852
We almost hit her with the car
the other day.

524
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:38,898
She lives in that piece of crap house
and you know she's loaded.

525
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:41,359
- She's...
- You're right.

526
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:44,487
She used to be known
for her gem collection.

527
00:47:44,988 --> 00:47:50,618
Kids... used to go up there
and try to steal stuff from her.

528
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:53,371
She became a total recluse.

529
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:58,585
I didn't know she was alive
till we damn near knocked her down.

530
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:05,967
She was standing
in the road, frozen,

531
00:48:06,092 --> 00:48:10,972
so I got out of the car and
walked over to see if she was OK.

532
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:13,516
She leaned over
and whispered in my ear.

533
00:48:13,725 --> 00:48:17,395
- What did she say?
- Frank wants me to talk to her.

534
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:20,940
He asked me
if I knew about time travel.

535
00:48:21,024 --> 00:48:25,194
She wrote a book about it,
so it can't be like a coincidence, right?

536
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:30,742
Donnie, what did
Roberta Sparrow say to you?

537
00:48:32,869 --> 00:48:36,205
She said every living creature
on earth dies alone.

538
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:42,420
How did that make you feel?

539
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:49,135
It reminded me of my dog Callie.

540
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,931
She died when I was eight and...

541
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:56,601
she crawled underneath the porch.

542
00:49:00,021 --> 00:49:02,398
To die?

543
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:06,527
To be alone.

544
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:09,906
Do you feel alone right now?

545
00:49:15,203 --> 00:49:17,246
I...

546
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:22,502
I mean, I'd like to believe I'm not,
but I just...

547
00:49:23,503 --> 00:49:26,381
I've just never seen any proof, so I...

548
00:49:26,506 --> 00:49:29,008
I just don't debate it any more,
you know.

549
00:49:29,092 --> 00:49:32,261
I could spend my whole life
debating it over and over again,

550
00:49:32,387 --> 00:49:34,764
weighting the pros and cons
and I still wouldn't have any proof,

551
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:38,184
so I just...
I just don't debate it any more.

552
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:40,770
It's absurd.

553
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,484
The search for God is absurd?

554
00:49:48,945 --> 00:49:51,239
It is if everyone dies alone.

555
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:54,117
Does that scare you?

556
00:49:57,954 --> 00:50:00,123
I don't want to be alone.

557
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:15,888
And so, his tapes
have made me realise

558
00:50:15,972 --> 00:50:21,144
that for the last 39 years I have been
a prisoner of my own fear.

559
00:50:21,894 --> 00:50:24,022
- Fear?

560
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:27,400
Rose, you have got to meet
this Jim Cunningham.

561
00:50:28,276 --> 00:50:30,486
I can't believe he's single.

562
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:36,075
'It has been a disappointing night
for these Super Bowl champions.

563
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:40,913
'Coach Joe Gibbs is on the sidelines,
water dripping off his glasses.

564
00:50:40,997 --> 00:50:44,167
'He's gotta be thinking,
"What went wrong tonight?"

565
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:47,503
- 'Here's the kick.'

566
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:50,048
'And it's no good.'

567
00:50:50,131 --> 00:50:53,342
We need a quarterback.
And a miracle.

568
00:50:53,468 --> 00:50:55,511
We need to go for a safety.

569
00:50:57,388 --> 00:51:00,683
'Mark Rypien certainly
has some big shoes to fill.

570
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:02,852
'He sure does.'

571
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:14,614
You guys want anything?

572
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,950
I'm gonna get a beer.

573
00:51:41,766 --> 00:51:44,811
'Good evening,
ladies and ghouls.

574
00:51:44,936 --> 00:51:47,563
'Join us at the Middlesex pavilion hall

575
00:51:47,647 --> 00:51:51,234
'for the Middlesex Halloween Haunt.'

576
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:19,030
What if you could go back in time

577
00:53:19,155 --> 00:53:24,160
and take all the pain and darkness
and replace it with something better?

578
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:27,830
- Images?
- Yeah. Like a Hawaiian sunset

579
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:31,959
or the Grand Canyon. Things
that remind you how beautiful...

580
00:53:32,043 --> 00:53:35,087
You know, we've been going together
for like, two weeks.

581
00:53:35,171 --> 00:53:36,714
Yeah.

582
00:53:38,883 --> 00:53:40,843
Well, I uh...

583
00:53:43,512 --> 00:53:45,848
Do you wanna kiss me?

584
00:53:49,644 --> 00:53:51,270
Uh...

585
00:53:52,688 --> 00:53:55,942
- I... Sorry...
- Donnie, wait. I just...

586
00:53:56,067 --> 00:54:02,156
I just want it to be at a time when it...

587
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,202
- When what?
- When it reminds me... just...

588
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:10,998
When it reminds you how beautiful
the world can be?

589
00:54:11,123 --> 00:54:12,833
Yeah.

590
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:17,546
And right now there's some fat guy
over there staring at us.

591
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:28,224
Thank you for seeing us
at such late notice.

592
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:32,645
We both felt it was time for us
to come in and discuss...

593
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:35,523
What I think is going on
with your son?

594
00:54:35,648 --> 00:54:37,858
Yes.

595
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:41,404
Um... Well, he's uh...

596
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:47,034
You know about his past,
and he was suspended from school

597
00:54:47,118 --> 00:54:49,287
for insulting his gym teacher.

598
00:54:49,412 --> 00:54:54,000
I'm not sure that's a good example.
He had just cause to insult...

599
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:58,296
Rose, let me just lay out
what I believe is happening here.

600
00:55:01,549 --> 00:55:04,760
Bonnie's aggressive behaviour,

601
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:09,140
his increased detachment
from reality,

602
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:13,269
seem to stem
from his inability to cope

603
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:17,523
with the forces in the world
that he perceives to be threatening.

604
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:25,114
Has he ever told you
about his friend Frank?

605
00:55:29,869 --> 00:55:32,163
Frank?

606
00:55:32,288 --> 00:55:34,123
The giant bunny rabbit.

607
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:36,792
What?

608
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:46,427
I don't recall him
ever having mentioned a rabbit.

609
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:51,515
Donnie is experiencing what is
commonly called a daylight hallucination.

610
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:59,065
This is a common occurrence
among paranoid schizophrenics.

611
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:03,319
What can we do?

612
00:56:03,444 --> 00:56:07,490
I would like to do more hypnotherapy.

613
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:11,994
And increase his medication.

614
00:56:18,626 --> 00:56:24,173
Whatever will help him, really,
because that's why we're here.

615
00:56:24,256 --> 00:56:29,345
We just would like him
to experience some... relief.

616
00:56:29,428 --> 00:56:34,266
So if you think that
more medication will do that,

617
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:38,687
then I think we should give it a try.

618
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:53,494
Donnie Darko.

619
00:56:56,372 --> 00:56:58,416
I know.

620
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:10,594
- Good morning, you Mongrels.
- Good morning.

621
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:13,764
Is that all the gusto you can muster?
I said good morning!

622
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:15,891
Good morning.

623
00:57:15,975 --> 00:57:18,310
Now, that's a tiny, tiny bit better.

624
00:57:18,394 --> 00:57:23,566
But I can still sense some students
who are afraid to say good morning.

625
00:57:23,691 --> 00:57:26,068
Good morning!

626
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:28,028
That's what I like to hear!

627
00:57:28,154 --> 00:57:31,115
Entirely too many
young men and women today

628
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:34,243
are completely paralysed
by their fears.

629
00:57:34,452 --> 00:57:39,165
They surrender their bodies
to the temptation and destruction

630
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:42,334
of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex.

631
00:57:43,252 --> 00:57:47,298
Now, I'm gonna tell you
a little story today.

632
00:57:47,423 --> 00:57:49,550
It's a heartbreakingly sad story

633
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:53,888
about a young man
whose life was completely destroyed

634
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:56,182
by these instruments of fear.

635
00:57:56,307 --> 00:58:01,645
A young man searching for love
in all the wrong places.

636
00:58:02,438 --> 00:58:04,773
His name was Frank.

637
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:13,949
Um, my stepsister... I sometimes
worry that she eats too much.

638
00:58:14,033 --> 00:58:16,702
- Shut up, Kim.
- Sweetheart, please.

639
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:21,207
- What can I do when I grow up?
- That's a hard one.

640
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:23,459
What do I do to learn
how to fight?

641
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:26,462
"What do I do to learn
how to fight?"

642
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:30,925
Son, violence is a product of fear.

643
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:34,178
- Learn to truly love yourself.
- OK.

644
00:58:34,303 --> 00:58:36,639
- Get yourself up here.
- OK.

645
00:58:36,764 --> 00:58:38,766
All right.

646
00:58:40,893 --> 00:58:43,979
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

647
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:47,066
Um, how much are they paying you
to be here?

648
00:58:48,651 --> 00:58:50,152
Excuse me?

649
00:58:52,404 --> 00:58:53,989
What is your name, son?

650
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:55,908
Gerald.

651
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:59,078
Gerald, I think you're afraid.

652
00:58:59,203 --> 00:59:04,625
Are you telling us this so we buy your
book? It's the worst advice I heard.

653
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:06,544
You see how sad this is?

654
00:59:06,669 --> 00:59:12,341
Want your sister to lose weight? Tell
her to get off the couch and exercise.

655
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:15,678
No-one knows what to do
when they grow up.

656
00:59:15,803 --> 00:59:19,390
It takes a while to find that out.
Right, Jim?

657
00:59:19,515 --> 00:59:21,475
And you.

658
00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:23,644
Yeah, you.

659
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:26,730
You sick of some jerk shoving
your head down the toilet?

660
00:59:26,855 --> 00:59:30,192
Maybe you should lift weights
or take a karate lesson.

661
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:33,070
Next time he tries to do it,
you kick him in the balls.

662
00:59:34,405 --> 00:59:36,198
Son.

663
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:38,158
Do you see this?

664
00:59:38,284 --> 00:59:41,704
This is an anger prisoner.
A textbook example.

665
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:43,330
You see the fear, people?

666
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:46,125
This boy is scared
to death of the truth.

667
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:49,587
Son, it breaks my heart to say this,

668
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:53,799
but I believe you are a very troubled
and confused young man.

669
00:59:53,882 --> 00:59:57,094
I believe, you were searching
for the answers in the wrong places.

670
00:59:57,219 --> 01:00:02,099
You're right, actually. I am pretty
troubled and pretty confused.

671
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:05,144
And I'm afraid.
Really afraid. Really afraid.

672
01:00:05,269 --> 01:00:08,689
But I think you're
the fucking Antichrist.

673
01:00:10,983 --> 01:00:14,612
Get him out of here!
Who do you think you are?

674
01:00:21,869 --> 01:00:23,621
It's amazing.

675
01:00:23,746 --> 01:00:28,083
The man thinks he's telling the truth.
Everything he says is just a fucking lie.

676
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:30,419
Everything he says.

677
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:33,631
Everyone thinks he's so rad.
He's such a chud.

678
01:00:33,714 --> 01:00:36,258
- Everything he does...
- Are you OK?

679
01:00:40,095 --> 01:00:43,098
- Yeah...
- Sit down. Calm down.

680
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:50,898
You ever hear of Grandma Death?

681
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:53,150
Who?

682
01:00:58,072 --> 01:01:00,741
"The Philosophy of Time Travel."

683
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:02,743
What is this?

684
01:01:02,951 --> 01:01:04,953
She wrote it.

685
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:15,756
I'm...

686
01:01:15,881 --> 01:01:17,591
I've been seeing stuff.

687
01:01:17,716 --> 01:01:20,469
Like a lot of really messed-up stuff.

688
01:01:21,804 --> 01:01:26,433
Chapters in there describe what
I've seen. It can't just be a coincidence.

689
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:33,524
Each vessel travels
along a vector through space time,

690
01:01:33,649 --> 01:01:35,567
along its centre of gravity.

691
01:01:35,693 --> 01:01:37,194
Like a spear?

692
01:01:39,113 --> 01:01:42,574
- I beg your pardon?
- A spear coming out of your chest.

693
01:01:43,575 --> 01:01:46,286
Um... sure, yeah.

694
01:01:46,412 --> 01:01:48,956
And in order for the vessel
to travel through time,

695
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:52,251
it's got to find a portal,
in this case a wormhole...

696
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:57,923
Could these portals just appear
anywhere, any time?

697
01:01:58,006 --> 01:02:00,384
I think that's highly unlikely.

698
01:02:00,509 --> 01:02:04,096
What you're talking about
is an act of God.

699
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:06,640
If God controls time,
then all time's pre-decided.

700
01:02:08,684 --> 01:02:12,896
- I'm not following you.
- Every living thing has a set path.

701
01:02:13,021 --> 01:02:15,941
And if you could see
your path or channel,

702
01:02:16,024 --> 01:02:21,447
you could see into the future.
Like... a form of time travel.

703
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:24,324
You're contradicting yourself, Donnie.

704
01:02:24,408 --> 01:02:28,871
If we were able to see our destinies
manifest themselves visually,

705
01:02:28,996 --> 01:02:32,958
then we would be given a choice
to betray our chosen destinies.

706
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:35,210
The fact that this choice exists

707
01:02:35,294 --> 01:02:39,214
would make all pre-formed destiny
come to an end.

708
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:41,508
Not if you travel within God's channel.

709
01:02:44,428 --> 01:02:50,601
Um... I'm not going to be able
to continue this conversation.

710
01:02:52,853 --> 01:02:56,231
- Why?
- I could lose my job.

711
01:02:57,024 --> 01:02:58,734
OK.

712
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:54,957
'Now you know where he lives.'

713
01:03:57,251 --> 01:03:59,628
And they grow out of our chest...

714
01:03:59,711 --> 01:04:01,630
solar plexus?

715
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:06,218
Like she described in the book.
The way they moved and smelled...

716
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:08,303
Like they're workers.

717
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:11,598
Assigned to each one of us.

718
01:04:11,682 --> 01:04:14,184
They just... They're like liquid.

719
01:04:15,686 --> 01:04:20,023
I followed it...
into my parents' bedroom.

720
01:04:21,108 --> 01:04:23,318
What did you find?

721
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:29,825
Nothing.

722
01:04:32,703 --> 01:04:36,248
So we call them IMGs.

723
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:38,375
Infant Memory Generators.

724
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:43,630
So you buy the glasses for an infant
and they wear them when they sleep.

725
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:48,176
But inside the glasses
are these slide photographs,

726
01:04:48,302 --> 01:04:51,388
and each one is of something
peaceful or beautiful,

727
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:53,974
whatever the parents want
to put inside.

728
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:56,977
What effect would this have
on an infant?

729
01:04:57,853 --> 01:05:00,898
Well, nobody remembers
their infancy.

730
01:05:00,981 --> 01:05:03,358
Anyone who says they do is lying.

731
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:06,069
We think this'll develop memory
earlier in life.

732
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:07,237
Yeah.

733
01:05:07,321 --> 01:05:13,201
Did you consider that darkness is part
of infants' natural development?

734
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:18,874
No.

735
01:05:21,335 --> 01:05:23,128
Yeah.

736
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:25,672
What if the parents
put in pictures of Satan?

737
01:05:25,756 --> 01:05:27,925
Dead people, crap like that.

738
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:30,510
Is that what you'd show your kids?

739
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:37,351
Uh, well, I mean... didn't your dad, like,
stab your mum?

740
01:05:40,938 --> 01:05:43,857
Ha ha ha ha!

741
01:05:46,568 --> 01:05:48,445
Get out.

742
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:51,573
Gretchen!

743
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:53,575
Gretchen. Gretchen.

744
01:05:53,659 --> 01:05:55,744
I'm sorry about those guys.

745
01:06:23,021 --> 01:06:26,858
- Two for "Evil Dead," please.
- Two dollars.

746
01:07:14,573 --> 01:07:18,035
Why do you wear
that stupid bunny suit?

747
01:07:22,998 --> 01:07:26,126
Why are you wearing
that stupid man's suit?

748
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:38,346
Take it off.

749
01:07:57,365 --> 01:08:00,410
What happened to your eye?

750
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:08,335
I'm so sorry.

751
01:08:15,634 --> 01:08:17,761
Why do they call you Frank?

752
01:08:19,054 --> 01:08:21,515
It's the name of my father

753
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,394
and his father before me.

754
01:08:30,148 --> 01:08:32,234
Frank?

755
01:08:35,737 --> 01:08:37,864
When's this gonna stop?

756
01:08:38,365 --> 01:08:40,534
You should already know that.

757
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:46,373
I want you to
watch the movie screen.

758
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:50,836
There's something
I want to show you.

759
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:01,805
Have you ever seen a portal?

760
01:09:20,365 --> 01:09:22,784
Burn it to the ground.

761
01:10:36,858 --> 01:10:40,695
OK. Now, girls,
I want you to concentrate.

762
01:10:40,779 --> 01:10:43,198
Failure is not an option.

763
01:10:43,323 --> 01:10:46,785
Bethany, if you feel the need
to vomit up there,

764
01:10:46,868 --> 01:10:49,871
- just swallow it.
- OK.

765
01:10:50,497 --> 01:10:53,041
Hey, you guys.
Good luck out there.

766
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:11,768
Get off the stage, Cherita!

767
01:11:15,939 --> 01:11:18,024
You suck!

768
01:11:25,407 --> 01:11:27,617
Hold on.

769
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:34,165
That was really something.

770
01:11:34,249 --> 01:11:36,918
Thank you, Cherita Chen,
with "Autumn Angel."

771
01:11:38,044 --> 01:11:40,714
Now the moment
we've all been waiting for.

772
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:43,842
It is my distinct pleasure
to introduce to you

773
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:46,469
Emily Bates, Suzy Bailey,

774
01:11:46,553 --> 01:11:50,056
Samantha Darko, Beth Farmer
and Joanie James.

775
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:52,851

How long was I asleep for?

796
01:14:50,153 --> 01:14:52,238
Whole movie.

797
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:05,335
Captain, looks like we got
another room back here.

Karen, we don't think the

What exactly about my methods
do you find inappropriate?

811
01:15:59,097 --> 01:16:01,641
I don't have time to get
into a debate about this, Karen.

812

I believe I've made myself clear.

813

Good afternoon.

823
01:17:06,414 --> 01:17:10,877
It gives me great pleasure to
announce that the school dance team

824
01:17:11,085 --> 01:17:15,340
has been invited to perform
on Ed McMahon's "Star Search '88"

825
01:17:15,423 --> 01:17:18,134
in Los Angeles, California.

826
01:17:52,502 --> 01:17:54,504
No, it was ridiculous...

827
01:17:54,587 --> 01:17:56,631
I'll call you back.

828
01:17:57,757 --> 01:18:00,510
- Rose.
- Kitty.

829
01:18:01,302 --> 01:18:06,182
I'm sure you're aware of the horrible
allegations against Jim Cunningham.

830
01:18:06,307 --> 01:18:09,644
I know, I saw it on TV.
Something about a kiddie porn...

831
01:18:09,852 --> 01:18:13,189
Oh, please! Don't use those words!

832
01:18:13,898 --> 01:18:18,027
It's obviously a conspiracy
to destroy an innocent man.

833
01:18:18,152 --> 01:18:23,074
I am going to spearhead the
Jim Cunningham defence campaign.

834
01:18:24,826 --> 01:18:29,163
Rose, I have to appear
at his arraignment tomorrow morning.

835
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:33,418
The girls are scheduled to leave
for Los Angeles in the morning.

836
01:18:33,543 --> 01:18:37,797
As their coach, I was the
obvious choice to chaperone them...

837
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:40,758
But now you can't go.

838
01:18:40,842 --> 01:18:42,510
- Yes.
- Hm.

839
01:18:42,635 --> 01:18:45,304
Now, believe me,
of all the other mothers,

840
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:47,432
I would never dream of asking you.

841
01:18:47,515 --> 01:18:50,768
But none of the other mothers
are available to go.

842
01:18:52,979 --> 01:18:55,064
I don't know, Kitty.

843
01:18:55,148 --> 01:18:58,151
It's a bad weekend.
Eddie's in New York.

844
01:18:58,276 --> 01:19:02,488
Rose, I don't know if you realise

845
01:19:02,613 --> 01:19:06,284
what an opportunity this is
for our daughters.

846
01:19:06,367 --> 01:19:11,414
This has been a dream of Samantha's
and all of ours for a long time.

847
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:14,917
I made her lead dancer.

848
01:19:15,835 --> 01:19:20,631
Sometimes I doubt your commitment
to Sparkle Motion.

849
01:19:50,745 --> 01:19:53,372
Elizabeth will be in charge.

850
01:19:53,456 --> 01:19:56,042
She'll drive you to therapy.

851
01:19:56,834 --> 01:20:01,172
And if you need anything, promise me
you will call Dr Thurman.

852
01:20:11,766 --> 01:20:15,645
How does it feel
to have a wacko for a son?

853
01:20:20,483 --> 01:20:22,568
It feels wonderful.

854
01:21:03,442 --> 01:21:06,904
What do I tell the others
when they ask about you?

855
01:21:08,990 --> 01:21:11,742
Tell them everything
is gonna be just fine.

856
01:21:13,828 --> 01:21:16,289
What's "cellar door"?

857
01:21:16,414 --> 01:21:19,709
This famous linguist once said

858
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:23,504
that of all the phrases
in the English language,

859
01:21:23,629 --> 01:21:27,925
of all the endless combinations
of words in all of history,

860
01:21:28,009 --> 01:21:31,637
that "cellar door" is the most beautiful.

861
01:21:33,973 --> 01:21:36,559
"Cellar door"?

862
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:11,886
I promise that one day
everything's gonna be better for you.

863
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:16,265
Shut up!

864
01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:33,324
- I want to talk about your past today.
- No.

865
01:22:33,407 --> 01:22:37,995
I want to talk
about you and your parents.

866
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:41,874
They didn't buy me
what I wanted for Christmas.

867
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:45,461
What did you want for Christmas
that year?

868
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:47,964
Hungry Hungry Hippos.

869
01:22:51,092 --> 01:22:55,554
How did you feel, being denied
these Hungry Hungry Hippos?

870
01:22:56,138 --> 01:22:57,640
Regret.

871
01:22:58,349 --> 01:23:01,018
What else makes you feel regret?

872
01:23:02,687 --> 01:23:04,814
That I did it again.

873
01:23:05,773 --> 01:23:07,900
You did it again?

874
01:23:08,609 --> 01:23:13,072
I flooded my school and I
burned down that pervert's house.

875
01:23:15,741 --> 01:23:19,078
I only have a few days
before they catch me.

876
01:23:19,203 --> 01:23:21,580
Did Frank tell you to do these things?

877
01:23:21,706 --> 01:23:24,875
I have to obey him. He saved my life.

878
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:29,338
I have to obey him
or I'll be left all alone,

879
01:23:29,422 --> 01:23:31,507
and then...

880
01:23:31,632 --> 01:23:36,053
and then I won't be able to figure out
what this is all about.

881
01:23:36,137 --> 01:23:39,598
I won't be able
to know his master plan.

882
01:23:40,474 --> 01:23:43,394
Do you mean God's master plan?

883
01:23:44,729 --> 01:23:47,231
Do you now believe in God?

884
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:50,067
I have the power
to build a time machine.

885
01:23:50,151 --> 01:23:52,069
How is that possible?

886
01:23:55,448 --> 01:23:59,118
How is time travel possible, Donnie?

887
01:23:59,201 --> 01:24:01,454
Time's up, Frank said.

888
01:24:01,579 --> 01:24:03,789
When is this going to happen?

889
01:24:03,914 --> 01:24:05,916
Soon.

890
01:24:07,501 --> 01:24:10,880
Soon.

891
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:28,147
What is going to happen?

892
01:24:30,483 --> 01:24:34,028
Frank is gonna kill.

893
01:24:34,153 --> 01:24:36,739
Who is he going to kill?

894
01:24:40,117 --> 01:24:43,662
- Who is he going to kill?
- I can see him right now!

895
01:24:48,709 --> 01:24:51,212
The sky is going to open up.

896
01:24:57,676 --> 01:25:02,264
If the sky were to suddenly open up,
there would be no law.

897
01:25:02,348 --> 01:25:04,266
There would be no rule.

898
01:25:04,350 --> 01:25:07,394
There would only be you
and your memories.

899
01:25:07,561 --> 01:25:12,525
The choices you've made
and the people you've touched.

900
01:25:13,442 --> 01:25:15,486
If this world were to end,

901
01:25:15,569 --> 01:25:19,615
there would only be you and him.

902
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:21,700
And no-one else.

903
01:25:59,947 --> 01:26:02,032
Hey.

904
01:26:02,116 --> 01:26:04,577
I got in.

905
01:26:05,619 --> 01:26:09,915
I am going to Harvard.

906
01:26:12,293 --> 01:26:14,420
We should totally throw a party.

907
01:26:14,545 --> 01:26:19,049
Mum and Dad are gone. It's Halloween.
We could get away with it.

908
01:26:19,133 --> 01:26:22,511
OK, but it has to be small, all right?

909
01:26:25,764 --> 01:26:27,641
Happy Halloween!

910
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:40,529
Beelzebub!

911
01:26:55,544 --> 01:26:59,423
We got eggs, water balloons
and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.

912
01:26:59,506 --> 01:27:01,800
I stole four beers from my dad.

913
01:27:01,884 --> 01:27:05,512

- Keg beer is for pussies.
