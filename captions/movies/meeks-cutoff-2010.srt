and in the Indians.

176
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,998
I'm led to believe there's 250
Americans in Oregon country.

177
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,749
There's seven more argonauts comin' in a
few weeks. Maybe that'll tip the scales.

178
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,751
Where would you
settle?

179

in Champoeg.

in Virginia.

Well, if it's riches you're
after, there's riches aplenty.

is a regular second Eden.

What now?

218
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,470
Well,
we skirt around.

219
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,115
Go south
till we make it around.

220
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,037
How far is it around?

221
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,838
Well, we'll find out.

222
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,912
Shouldn't be too far. The maps
I've seen don't record much of this.

Meet back with the

229
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,798
There's scarce
grass and water up north.

230
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,438
South is the best bet.

231
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,318
[Solomon Chuckling] Well, there's
nothing where we came from either,

232
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,472
and there's nothing ahead,
so I'm saying north.

233
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,397
We'll move closer
to the Columbia.

234
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,510
That way we can rejoin
the communication.

How many days to the

Well, too many.

238

West is the goal. The sooner
we get moving west, the better.

The quickest way west,
by my reckoning...

do you have an opinion?

I think north too.

this country, more or less.

get you to the Valley. I will.

that, Mr. Meek. We understand.

They can hide under a wolf skin so
quiet, you step on 'em before you know it.

286
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:31,757
And where one redskin is, there's
a dozen more just lurkin' nearby.

I mean, sometimes they wait till they're
fired on, but most often they don't.

When they come
on a woman,

291

they kill her.
