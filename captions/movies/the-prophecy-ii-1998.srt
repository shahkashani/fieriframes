1
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,600
Lord, blind my eyes
to these visions...

2
00:00:13,684 --> 00:00:16,603
and deafen my ears
to the screams.

3
00:00:16,687 --> 00:00:20,858
For I have seen legions
of God's army fall...

4
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:24,903
and heard the dying cries
of 10,000 angels.

5
00:00:24,945 --> 00:00:27,322
Guide my hand, Lord,

6
00:00:27,406 --> 00:00:31,702
for what I see is the coming end
of the Kingdom of Heaven.

7
00:02:20,436 --> 00:02:24,440
Protect and keep these pages
in Heaven's darkest hour.

8
00:02:26,358 --> 00:02:28,777
And watch over us, Lord.

9
00:02:31,947 --> 00:02:36,326
For Heaven's war
has come to Earth.

10
00:02:36,368 --> 00:02:38,328
Thomas Dagget.

11
00:02:49,006 --> 00:02:51,091
It's five past the hour,

12
00:02:51,175 --> 00:02:53,844
and that means a quick look
at today's weather.

13
00:02:53,927 --> 00:02:55,888
This morning, San Fernando valley
residents got a surprise...

14
00:02:55,929 --> 00:02:58,807
when they found frost
on their windshields.

15
00:02:58,891 --> 00:03:01,852
But things will be
warming up this afternoon.
The gusty winds will be dying down.

16
00:03:01,894 --> 00:03:04,521
We'll have clear skies,
good to moderate air quality.

17
00:03:04,605 --> 00:03:08,108
Temperatures... seventies in
the valleys, sixties at the beaches.

18
00:03:08,192 --> 00:03:10,402
As far as traffic is concerned,
the SIG alert we had this morning,

19
00:03:10,486 --> 00:03:14,907
reported northbound on the 405
at Sunset, is still backing things up.

20
00:03:14,948 --> 00:03:16,909
We'll have to wait
while authorities...

21
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,994
What time is it?
I'm coming. I'm coming.
investigate that situation.

22
00:03:19,078 --> 00:03:21,705
Southbound on the 405 has normal
slowing. However, it has snagged up...

23
00:03:21,747 --> 00:03:24,041
quite a ways past...
Aah!

24
00:03:33,926 --> 00:03:37,554
What do you got?
Hit by a pedestrian.
Car accident. EP: 90 over 60.

25
00:03:37,638 --> 00:03:39,723
Contusions to the head
and neck. Clear this hallway!

26
00:03:39,765 --> 00:03:41,767
People, get out of the way.
Are you okay?

27
00:03:41,809 --> 00:03:45,020
Yeah, I will be if... Jesus!
I don't know what happened.

28
00:03:45,104 --> 00:03:47,022
He was just there.
How fast were you going?

29
00:03:47,106 --> 00:03:50,317
Twenty, thirty.
All right, prep four.
I'll be in in a minute.

30
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,653
You got it.
Get the door!

31
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,326
Don't be afraid.
What?

32
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,912
Don't be afraid.

33
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:06,542
We'll take it from here, Val.
Thanks.

34
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,554
He's coming!

35
00:04:18,637 --> 00:04:21,014
Gabriel's coming!
He's coming!

36
00:04:26,645 --> 00:04:30,149
He's coming for me!

37
00:04:30,232 --> 00:04:32,734
What's going on?
I don't know, Father.
He just started screaming.

38
00:04:34,486 --> 00:04:36,530
I tried to open the door,
but he locked it.

39
00:04:38,115 --> 00:04:40,117
Yes.

40
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,119
Thomas?
Thomas?

41
00:04:44,204 --> 00:04:48,083
Thomas? Step back!

42
00:04:52,796 --> 00:04:54,715
Thomas?

43
00:05:04,183 --> 00:05:06,101
Thomas?

44
00:05:06,185 --> 00:05:08,937
He's coming for you.

45
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:56,819
It's time for you
to go, Gabriel.

46
00:05:56,902 --> 00:05:58,821
This is not my war,

47
00:05:58,904 --> 00:06:01,949
and Hell isn't big enough
for both of us.

48
00:09:03,046 --> 00:09:04,965
Hey.

49
00:09:05,048 --> 00:09:06,925
How are you feeling?

50
00:09:12,014 --> 00:09:14,516
Look, I, um...

51
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,977
Danyael.

52
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:18,979
Danyael?

53
00:09:20,439 --> 00:09:22,983
I don't know if you remember me.

54
00:09:27,321 --> 00:09:30,282
I just wanted
to apologize.

55
00:09:30,324 --> 00:09:34,828
I could've killed you.
Take a lot more than that to kill me.

56
00:09:34,912 --> 00:09:36,830
Valerie...

57
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,044
talk to me.

58
00:10:40,144 --> 00:10:44,898
The monkeys
never did get that one right.

59
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:50,279
It's not willing servants of Heaven.
It's winged.

60
00:10:52,364 --> 00:10:54,324
So, you found me.

61
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:01,582
This place looks lived in.

62
00:11:08,672 --> 00:11:12,760
What about these visions,
Thomas?

63
00:11:12,843 --> 00:11:14,762
What do you do?

64
00:11:15,971 --> 00:11:18,682
You write them down
on a-a scroll...

65
00:11:18,724 --> 00:11:21,101
and stone tablet.

66
00:11:21,185 --> 00:11:24,062
I know you prophets
enjoy doing that.

67
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,860
Or... maybe a picture?

68
00:11:29,902 --> 00:11:32,362
A certain someone?

69
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:39,203
I know you've
seen her, Thomas.

70
00:11:46,502 --> 00:11:48,420
So?

71
00:11:48,504 --> 00:11:50,422
Who is she?

72
00:11:50,506 --> 00:11:53,175
Ironic, isn't it?

73
00:11:53,258 --> 00:11:55,969
An archangel needs a monkey
to get a vision from God.

74
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:06,230
That's a small step
from prophet to mortar.

75
00:12:11,693 --> 00:12:13,737
Can you take it?

76
00:12:22,663 --> 00:12:24,832
Dr. Parson said you'd sign these.
Can we do it later?

77
00:12:24,915 --> 00:12:26,834
Yeah, sure.
Thanks.

78
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:29,670
Ready?

79
00:12:29,753 --> 00:12:32,673
One, two, three.

80
00:12:32,756 --> 00:12:35,259
Wow!

81
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,261
See that?

82
00:12:39,012 --> 00:12:40,973
Wow!

83
00:12:44,476 --> 00:12:46,437
Whoa!

84
00:12:54,361 --> 00:12:56,739
Do it again.

85
00:12:56,822 --> 00:12:59,032
Do it again.

86
00:12:59,116 --> 00:13:01,910
Be well, guys.

87
00:13:01,994 --> 00:13:04,621
Bye.

88
00:13:04,663 --> 00:13:06,915
That was
a pretty great exit.

89
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:09,460
I got waylaid.

90
00:13:09,501 --> 00:13:13,380
Well, I hope you don't mind.
I had this dry-cleaned.

91
00:13:13,464 --> 00:13:16,633
I figured it was
the least I could do.

92
00:13:16,717 --> 00:13:18,677
You don't have to keep
apologizing, Valerie.

93
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:22,181
Yeah, well, you don't have
to keep forgiving me either.

94
00:13:22,222 --> 00:13:25,142
It's in my upbringing.

95
00:13:25,184 --> 00:13:28,270
Well, guilt's
in mine, so...

96
00:13:28,353 --> 00:13:31,648
How would you feel
about seeing me again?

97
00:13:35,486 --> 00:13:38,530
Most of the kids
in the ward are terminal.

98
00:13:38,614 --> 00:13:42,034
I mean, I used to spend
a lot of time hoping and hoping.

99
00:13:42,076 --> 00:13:44,286
And then I just stopped.

100
00:13:44,369 --> 00:13:46,663
It makes you wonder
what the point is.

101
00:13:46,705 --> 00:13:48,791
And what do you think
the point is, Valerie?

102
00:13:48,874 --> 00:13:51,794
Right now?

103
00:13:51,877 --> 00:13:56,131
Four hundred and seventy-two
dollars a week, plus benefits.

104
00:13:56,215 --> 00:13:59,551
Makes me sad.
Hmm.

105
00:13:59,635 --> 00:14:02,471
Wonder if it should
make me sad too.

106
00:14:02,554 --> 00:14:05,057
Maybe it should.

107
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,643
What, you just don't like
talking about yourself?

108
00:14:07,726 --> 00:14:12,106
Not much to tell. I think you're
the more interesting one in this pair.

109
00:14:12,189 --> 00:14:14,566
You think?
Mm-hmm.

110
00:14:14,608 --> 00:14:17,194
I don't know.
That looks pretty interesting to me.

111
00:14:17,236 --> 00:14:19,446
Just something I got
when I was young.

112
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:22,658
Yeah?
You were married?

113
00:14:22,741 --> 00:14:25,577
Uh, yeah.

114
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:27,955
What happened?

115
00:14:28,038 --> 00:14:33,127
Um... Well, we lived together
for three years,

116
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,587
and then we were married
for three months.

117
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:39,341
And when he wasn't running up my
Visa card, he was home watching that...

118
00:14:39,425 --> 00:14:41,468
You know that
real-life cop show?

119
00:14:41,552 --> 00:14:46,014
He wasn't exactly the most
employable soul on the planet.

120
00:14:46,098 --> 00:14:48,392
Where is he now?

121
00:14:48,434 --> 00:14:50,394
He left.

122
00:14:50,436 --> 00:14:52,980
I'm sorry.

123
00:14:53,063 --> 00:14:55,774
It's okay. I mean,
it's probably for the best.

124
00:14:55,858 --> 00:14:58,986
I was miserable.
I just didn't know it.

125
00:15:02,948 --> 00:15:05,868
He was a fool.

126
00:15:07,286 --> 00:15:10,497
I thought you were
just walking me home.

127
00:15:10,581 --> 00:15:12,833
Would you rather
I leave?

128
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,922
I'm not sure.

129
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,677
It's not a good time.
Yeah.

130
00:15:23,761 --> 00:15:25,679
I know.

131
00:15:33,145 --> 00:15:35,147
You all right?

132
00:15:36,482 --> 00:15:38,400
I'm fine.

133
00:16:24,738 --> 00:16:26,990
Do you accept me?

134
00:16:27,032 --> 00:16:30,994
What? What?
Do you accept me?

135
00:16:33,038 --> 00:16:35,624
Yes.

136
00:17:20,252 --> 00:17:22,171
Valerie?

137
00:17:29,803 --> 00:17:33,766
Be well, Valerie.
Valerie?

138
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,730
Valerie?

139
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,610
Is it done?

140
00:18:28,028 --> 00:18:29,988
It's done.

141
00:18:33,158 --> 00:18:35,119
It took you
long enough.

142
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,287
Michael said
not to force her.

143
00:18:37,329 --> 00:18:40,082
Michael didn't say
take your time.

144
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:33,635
Long time, Danyael.

145
00:19:33,761 --> 00:19:36,305
Nice to see you again.

146
00:20:17,638 --> 00:20:19,598
Good-bye, brother.

147
00:21:26,874 --> 00:21:29,084
Aah!

148
00:21:36,633 --> 00:21:38,719
Take a deep breath,
Danyael.

149
00:21:38,761 --> 00:21:40,721
It's not too late
to fix this.

150
00:21:40,804 --> 00:21:43,682
Come back. Now.

151
00:21:43,766 --> 00:21:46,727
As far as I'm concerned,
nothing happened.

152
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:49,438
She was a momentary lapse
of self-control, Danyael.

153
00:21:49,563 --> 00:21:51,523
But I'll find her.

154
00:21:51,523 --> 00:21:53,484
Don't walk away!

155
00:21:54,777 --> 00:21:56,737
Kids.

156
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,490
They don't listen
these days.

157
00:22:00,532 --> 00:22:03,452
You're no kid, Rafayel.

158
00:22:05,037 --> 00:22:07,039
The monkey. Hmm?

159
00:22:07,164 --> 00:22:09,083
Who is she?
Where is she?

160
00:22:09,124 --> 00:22:13,128
Why couldn't you have just stayed
in the basement, Gabriel?

161
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:16,048
Why couldn't you stay out of it
and mind your business?

162
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:19,635
This was my fight.
You made it yours.

163
00:22:19,676 --> 00:22:23,514
My enemy's friend
is my enemy.

164
00:22:23,555 --> 00:22:27,851
How many more worlds have to burn
before you're satisfied, Gabriel?

165
00:22:27,893 --> 00:22:29,853
Just the one.

166
00:22:31,605 --> 00:22:33,607
This one.

167
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:36,026
Aah!

168
00:22:40,781 --> 00:22:43,242
I'm not greedy.

169
00:23:06,974 --> 00:23:08,809
Hi.

170
00:23:08,892 --> 00:23:10,894
I'm wondering if you could help me.
I have a friend...

171
00:23:10,978 --> 00:23:13,439
and she got herself
in a bit of a situation.

172
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,942
And I was wondering if maybe
she might've been in to see you?

173
00:23:16,984 --> 00:23:19,737
We have a very
broad-based clientele, sir.

174
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,030
If this was her, um...

175
00:23:22,114 --> 00:23:24,241
Claim check.
Exactly. Claim check.

176
00:23:24,324 --> 00:23:26,285
If this was her
claim check,

177
00:23:26,326 --> 00:23:29,204
could you find her name
and where she lives...

178
00:23:29,288 --> 00:23:32,916
in that, uh,
whatever it is?

179
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:35,419
Of course.
Thank you.

180
00:23:35,461 --> 00:23:39,673
This laundry's already been picked up.

181
00:23:39,757 --> 00:23:41,759
So I can't give
that information out.

182
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,929
Oh, she wouldn't mind.
We're family.
You just said you were friends.

183
00:23:45,971 --> 00:23:48,724
Caught me. Very good.

184
00:23:48,807 --> 00:23:51,268
Martin, don't ask me
how I know. Shh.

185
00:24:10,162 --> 00:24:13,457
Uuh!

186
00:24:23,592 --> 00:24:27,930
Your head.
It hurts here, or it hurts here?

187
00:24:28,013 --> 00:24:31,141
Here.
Mm-hmm.

188
00:24:31,183 --> 00:24:33,477
And your belly... la panza...
it hurts up here...

189
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:35,896
or down here?

190
00:24:35,979 --> 00:24:38,399
Kind of... here.

191
00:24:38,482 --> 00:24:40,776
Well, I'm making
you some eggs.

192
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:42,986
No, the cereal was
just fine. Thanks.

193
00:24:43,028 --> 00:24:44,988
But you love eggs.
I'm making you eggs.

194
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,658
Nana, gross.
No eggs.

195
00:24:47,699 --> 00:24:49,993
No eggs, please
Every morning, you ask me for eggs.

196
00:24:50,035 --> 00:24:51,995
Na...
I am making some eggs.

197
00:24:52,037 --> 00:24:56,500
Nana, I don't want eggs.

198
00:24:56,542 --> 00:25:00,504
I don't wanna be skinny.
That's not what this is about.

199
00:25:00,546 --> 00:25:03,799
Pr... I'm pregnant. I'm pregnant.
I have a cold. I have a cold.

200
00:25:03,882 --> 00:25:05,968
Every time I skin my knee,
you're telling me that I'm pregnant.

201
00:25:06,051 --> 00:25:08,053
Jesus, that's why I wanted
to become a nurse:

202
00:25:08,137 --> 00:25:11,849
to prove to you that people
don't get pregnant just because
they've scraped their knee.

203
00:25:22,818 --> 00:25:24,987
So?

204
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:28,991
I'd like to know where your
grandmother went to medical school.

205
00:25:31,118 --> 00:25:33,579
There must be
a mistake.

206
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:36,707
There's no mistake, Vally.
You're pregnant.

207
00:25:36,749 --> 00:25:38,959
That's not possible.

208
00:25:39,042 --> 00:25:41,670
Kath, I've been
with one man.

209
00:25:41,754 --> 00:25:44,047
And that was just
a couple days ago.

210
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:50,012
Um... You know,
you're not just pregnant.

211
00:25:51,597 --> 00:25:55,517
According to the test,
you're in your second trimester.

212
00:26:47,111 --> 00:26:49,488
Hey.

213
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,490
It's done.

214
00:26:54,868 --> 00:26:57,287
Oh, it's incredible.
It is.

215
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:05,587
I can't think of a better night
to do it,Julian.

216
00:27:05,671 --> 00:27:08,799
If it's the only way
I can have you,

217
00:27:08,841 --> 00:27:12,469
then I won't have it
any other way.

218
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:14,471
I put that in the note.

219
00:27:14,513 --> 00:27:18,434
That's just beautiful.

220
00:27:18,517 --> 00:27:20,436
Are you ready?

221
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:23,647
I'm ready.
I'm ready.

222
00:27:23,731 --> 00:27:26,108
Oh!

223
00:27:29,653 --> 00:27:31,780
I'll see you
in Heaven, baby.

224
00:27:35,117 --> 00:27:37,536
Meet you there.

225
00:27:48,046 --> 00:27:50,632
Aah!

226
00:27:54,178 --> 00:27:56,305
Show time.

227
00:28:07,191 --> 00:28:09,651
Anybody home?
Huh?

228
00:28:11,653 --> 00:28:13,572
Hmph.
That's too bad.

229
00:28:23,832 --> 00:28:26,001
Intensive care.
My favorite.

230
00:28:26,085 --> 00:28:30,047
Izzy. Izzy.

231
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:33,592
Isabelle.
Come back.

232
00:28:33,634 --> 00:28:35,761
Come back.

233
00:28:35,844 --> 00:28:39,807
I know you're in there.
Come on back now.

234
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:42,726
Back it up.
Back it up.

235
00:28:42,768 --> 00:28:45,062
Hi.

236
00:28:45,104 --> 00:28:47,064
Nice hair.

237
00:28:48,941 --> 00:28:53,320
Julian?
He's gone. He's dead.

238
00:28:53,404 --> 00:28:56,156
He's taking
a dirt nap.

239
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,410
Julian.
Look, I need your help.
I'm short-staffed at the moment.

240
00:29:01,787 --> 00:29:04,081
Don't start.

241
00:29:04,164 --> 00:29:06,625
Don't start. I hate that. Please.

242
00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:10,295
He's the cold eye. He's spilled milk.
Ju...Julian.

243
00:29:10,379 --> 00:29:14,299
Julian.
Come on. Come on, kiddo.

244
00:29:14,383 --> 00:29:16,385
Oh.

245
00:29:16,468 --> 00:29:19,221
Come on, kiddo.
We got work to do.

246
00:29:20,305 --> 00:29:22,975
Julian.
Julian!

247
00:29:23,058 --> 00:29:26,270
Didn't I kill myself?
Yes and no.

248
00:29:26,311 --> 00:29:28,731
The answer to that
is up to me.

249
00:29:32,651 --> 00:29:35,070
Oh, my God.

250
00:29:36,447 --> 00:29:38,365
How do you know
he did it?

251
00:29:38,449 --> 00:29:42,202
A witness saw your friend rip the guy's
heart out with his bare hands.

252
00:29:42,286 --> 00:29:44,747
Plus, he left this
at the crime scene.

253
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:47,458
Somehow, he managed to check in and out
without leaving his name.

254
00:29:47,499 --> 00:29:50,419
But we traced him to you
through that patient I.D. number.

255
00:29:50,502 --> 00:29:53,464
So what can you tell us
about the man?

256
00:29:53,505 --> 00:29:56,300
Nothing. I...
I barely knew him.

257
00:29:56,341 --> 00:29:58,635
It's not surprising.

258
00:29:58,677 --> 00:30:01,972
Does that ring a bell?

259
00:30:03,807 --> 00:30:06,560
Well, he had a,
um, like...

260
00:30:06,643 --> 00:30:10,147
You Val?
Yes.

261
00:30:10,189 --> 00:30:12,900
You the nurse?
Yes.

262
00:30:12,983 --> 00:30:16,820
You done with her?
Yeah. Take her.

263
00:30:16,862 --> 00:30:19,782
Come here.

264
00:30:19,865 --> 00:30:22,618
I don't know what to tell you.
Yeah. Shut up.

265
00:30:22,701 --> 00:30:25,204
Listen.

266
00:30:25,287 --> 00:30:27,539
No. Really listen.
Both ears.

267
00:30:27,623 --> 00:30:29,625
Nod to tell me both ears
are listening. All right.

268
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:33,629
I've dealt with a thousand bodies in
this office. Floaters, crispy critters,

269
00:30:33,712 --> 00:30:36,924
bunk bait; bodies you wouldn't
even know were bodies if it
wasn't for a driver's license.

270
00:30:37,007 --> 00:30:39,468
Yes, well, I don't see
what that has to do...
Don't talk, Val.

271
00:30:39,551 --> 00:30:44,014
Bodies chopped and minced and skinned
and used as table decorations.

272
00:30:44,098 --> 00:30:49,061
That's your job.
You're talking again.
Yeah. No. Listen.

273
00:30:49,103 --> 00:30:53,607
Four years ago, a body came in here
tattooed like those;

274
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:56,860
crushed like those;
eyeless.

275
00:30:56,902 --> 00:30:59,696
But hey, I'm a sport.
I play along.

276
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,533
I tried to determine
what had rolled into my office.

277
00:31:02,574 --> 00:31:04,827
But the questions just got deeper.
No sign of growth,

278
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:07,162
no white cells,
no optic nerves.

279
00:31:07,246 --> 00:31:10,040
I realized what was there before me
had never been born.

280
00:31:10,082 --> 00:31:12,960
That's not possible.
That's what I thought.

281
00:31:13,043 --> 00:31:16,547
And then it was gone. Burned up in
a flash one night. All the records...

282
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:19,383
Everything to indicate that
it had been there disappeared.

283
00:31:19,425 --> 00:31:21,677
Everybody that had anything
to do with that body...

284
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,054
has either died...
or gone mad,

285
00:31:24,138 --> 00:31:27,182
including my friend Thomas.
Who's he?

286
00:31:27,266 --> 00:31:29,184
A detective.
Became a monk.

287
00:31:29,268 --> 00:31:33,731
He used to send me cheese wheels
every Christmas.
Where can I find him?

288
00:31:33,772 --> 00:31:36,567
You can't. He's dead.

289
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:39,153
Burnt to ash up at
St. Gregory's Monastery.

290
00:31:39,236 --> 00:31:41,405
What do you mean,
burnt to ash?

291
00:31:42,823 --> 00:31:44,992
You look like
a nice person, Val.

292
00:31:45,075 --> 00:31:47,202
Take my advice:
walk away.

293
00:31:47,286 --> 00:31:50,539
Don't get involved
whatever you do.

294
00:31:50,622 --> 00:31:52,583
Get the lights.

295
00:32:57,481 --> 00:32:59,400
Hey,Joe.

296
00:33:33,517 --> 00:33:35,436
Thank you.

297
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,064
Miss Rosales, I really don't know
what else I can tell you.

298
00:33:39,148 --> 00:33:41,066
His death shocked everybody.

299
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:44,194
Thomas was a fine member
of our order.

300
00:33:44,236 --> 00:33:47,906
I understand he used to be a detective.
Mm-hmm.

301
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:51,452
Well, did he ever talk to you about
any odd cases that he had?

302
00:33:51,535 --> 00:33:54,079
Anything dealing with cults
or gangs or anything?

303
00:33:54,163 --> 00:33:58,834
Miss Rosales, I really can't
disclose anything more.
I know, Father.

304
00:33:58,917 --> 00:34:00,753
Now, if you'll excuse me.
It's just that...

305
00:34:00,836 --> 00:34:03,130
he was involved with
something a while ago...

306
00:34:03,213 --> 00:34:05,883
and it's something that I
may have stepped into as well.

307
00:34:10,804 --> 00:34:13,724
It's, um, angelic script.

308
00:34:13,766 --> 00:34:18,520
According to the old Hebrews, God marked
all his angels with such a sign.

309
00:34:20,564 --> 00:34:25,402
Or so Thomas told me. He was
a bit of an expert on such matters.

310
00:34:26,487 --> 00:34:28,447
How so?

311
00:34:32,284 --> 00:34:34,745
All right.
Uh, listen.

312
00:34:34,787 --> 00:34:38,832
This is not something
I would normally discuss, but, uh,

313
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:42,377
since it seems
so important to you.

314
00:34:42,461 --> 00:34:44,421
Please.

315
00:34:52,137 --> 00:34:56,600
Thomas was obsessed
on the subject of angels.

316
00:34:58,102 --> 00:35:02,898
So much so that he claimed
to have had visions about them.

317
00:35:02,981 --> 00:35:04,900
According to him,

318
00:35:04,983 --> 00:35:08,821
some angels became jealous that God was
giving too much attention to mankind.

319
00:35:08,904 --> 00:35:11,407
So they tried
to wipe humans out...

320
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:13,700
under the archangel Gabriel.

321
00:35:13,784 --> 00:35:16,745
Please, have a seat.
Thank you.

322
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:20,416
The problem was,
to do that...

323
00:35:20,499 --> 00:35:25,212
they had to contend with other angels
that were still loyal to God's will.

324
00:35:25,295 --> 00:35:28,424
It caused a kind
of civil war up there.

325
00:35:28,507 --> 00:35:31,343
It tore Heaven apart.

326
00:35:31,427 --> 00:35:34,847
Thomas believed...

327
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:37,307
there was to be
a final confrontation.

328
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:40,644
And if the good side wins,
great.

329
00:35:40,728 --> 00:35:43,147
And if not?

330
00:35:45,232 --> 00:35:47,192
If not...

331
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:00,622
What does that mean?

332
00:36:00,748 --> 00:36:04,001
Then ash from
a burning Heaven...

333
00:36:04,126 --> 00:36:06,962
will cover the Earth.

334
00:36:09,965 --> 00:36:12,760
Well, if this guy was
so good at prophesizing,

335
00:36:12,843 --> 00:36:15,596
did he bother to say
how it ends?

336
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:20,434
It gets metaphorical. It talks about
the union of Heaven and Earth.

337
00:36:20,517 --> 00:36:23,812
The coming of a Nephilim.
A what?

338
00:36:23,896 --> 00:36:26,857
A Nephilim.
A child born...

339
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,568
of an angel
and a human woman.

340
00:36:29,693 --> 00:36:33,322
It's talked about
in Genesis six.

341
00:36:33,405 --> 00:36:37,910
I, honestly, don't know
what to make of it.

342
00:37:10,567 --> 00:37:13,946
When humans began
to multiply on the face of the Earth...

343
00:37:14,029 --> 00:37:16,073
and daughters were born to them,

344
00:37:16,156 --> 00:37:21,078
the sons of God saw they were beautiful,
and took wives for themselves.

345
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,039
All that they desired.

346
00:37:24,123 --> 00:37:27,167
The Nephilim were on the Earth
in those days.

347
00:37:27,251 --> 00:37:31,171
When the sons of God went
into the daughters of humans...

348
00:37:31,255 --> 00:37:33,632
and bore children to them,

349
00:37:33,674 --> 00:37:37,219
they were giants,
men of great and terrible renown.

350
00:37:56,238 --> 00:38:00,701
So, you're keeping me alive
because you don't know DOS?

351
00:38:03,996 --> 00:38:06,081
What was the number?

352
00:38:06,165 --> 00:38:08,959
Three-three,
six-six.

353
00:38:09,001 --> 00:38:13,422
Wait. What's that?
Something's happening.

354
00:38:13,505 --> 00:38:16,633
Is that her?
Bingo.

355
00:38:16,717 --> 00:38:19,636
Rosales.

356
00:38:19,678 --> 00:38:21,638
Valerie.

357
00:38:59,009 --> 00:39:01,804
And folks,
up next, a very special item to
make a bright day even brighter.

358
00:39:01,887 --> 00:39:04,556
This beautiful, soft
white and lavender gown...
Nana?

359
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,601
will compliment a new bride
as she walks down the aisle...

360
00:39:07,684 --> 00:39:10,854
on that most special of days.

361
00:39:10,938 --> 00:39:13,774
This fine quality linen,
cotton and silk dress...

362
00:39:13,899 --> 00:39:15,818
will surely become
a family heirloom...

363
00:39:15,859 --> 00:39:17,903
that will last for ages.
Nana?

364
00:39:17,945 --> 00:39:20,114
That's right, Jim.
And notice the fine...

365
00:39:20,197 --> 00:39:24,076
satin applique
around the neckline.

366
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:26,286
Isn't it beautiful?
Karen, it's really...

367
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:28,539
craftsman work throughout.

368
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,582
They don't make them like this anymore.

369
00:39:30,624 --> 00:39:33,585
Nana?

370
00:39:37,589 --> 00:39:39,550
Nana?

371
00:39:52,104 --> 00:39:54,064
Nana?

372
00:39:55,941 --> 00:39:58,068
Nana?

373
00:39:59,778 --> 00:40:02,531
Nana?
Nana's gone, you know.

374
00:40:02,656 --> 00:40:05,409
Nana didn't have much time left,
in any case.

375
00:40:05,409 --> 00:40:09,246
In the end, it wasn't gonna be
something you'd wanna witness.

376
00:40:14,084 --> 00:40:16,545
Look at it this way.

377
00:40:16,628 --> 00:40:19,214
You two can
hook up later.

378
00:40:19,339 --> 00:40:23,844
You have no idea
the trouble you got there.

379
00:40:30,267 --> 00:40:32,186
No!

380
00:40:34,188 --> 00:40:38,692
What's going on here is not personal.
It's business.

381
00:40:38,776 --> 00:40:41,904
It's what I do best.

382
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:47,117
Get out!

383
00:40:49,161 --> 00:40:53,290
Monkey wannabe. Wanna dance?

384
00:41:06,136 --> 00:41:10,474
You'll have to learn
a modicum of respect.

385
00:41:17,106 --> 00:41:19,566
Remember who
did this to you.

386
00:41:29,993 --> 00:41:32,913
Go!

387
00:42:10,701 --> 00:42:13,579
This is good.

388
00:42:15,748 --> 00:42:17,833
Step on it.

389
00:42:33,223 --> 00:42:36,351
Stop!

390
00:42:36,477 --> 00:42:39,438
Back it up.
Back it up!

391
00:42:50,574 --> 00:42:53,285
Drive much?

392
00:42:54,578 --> 00:42:56,580
Try not to hit the dog.

393
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:34,118
You didn't say anything
about me killing anybody.

394
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:39,415
Do it... for Julian.

395
00:43:39,498 --> 00:43:41,417
Or forever wish you'd had.

396
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:55,305
Just do it.

397
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:06,650
Atta girl.

398
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:43,479
I'd get the fuck out of here
if I were you.

399
00:45:00,245 --> 00:45:03,082
Valerie. Shh.

400
00:45:32,194 --> 00:45:34,113
Hello?

401
00:45:35,948 --> 00:45:37,908
Help!

402
00:45:40,494 --> 00:45:42,454
Hello!

403
00:45:53,799 --> 00:45:57,261
Who are you?
I think you know.

404
00:45:57,344 --> 00:46:00,180
You didn't answer me.

405
00:46:00,264 --> 00:46:03,267
I'm sorry.
That's the best I can do.

406
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,604
The best you can do.
Well, guess what?

407
00:46:07,646 --> 00:46:10,357
Your best is not good enough!
I don't know...

408
00:46:10,441 --> 00:46:12,901
what they taught you
in kindergarten, but your best
does not cut it here, okay?

409
00:46:12,985 --> 00:46:15,863
You seduce me! You knock me up!
My grandma's dead!

410
00:46:15,946 --> 00:46:18,282
And some freak comes to my house
and he tries to kill...

411
00:46:18,365 --> 00:46:20,951
I mean, who... who was that
trying to kill me?

412
00:46:21,034 --> 00:46:24,079
Gabriel.

413
00:46:24,163 --> 00:46:26,582
I must've missed
the trumpet.

414
00:46:26,665 --> 00:46:29,334
Valerie, please.

415
00:46:30,502 --> 00:46:33,005
You don't understand.
I understand fine.

416
00:46:33,046 --> 00:46:35,299
You are psychotic.

417
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:38,093
You don't know how
important you are.

418
00:46:40,387 --> 00:46:43,348
Let me tell you
a secret.

419
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:47,728
It was revealed to us that
there would be a child.

420
00:46:47,811 --> 00:46:51,940
A child born of
my kind and yours.

421
00:46:52,024 --> 00:46:56,278
The child that would unite my brothers
again and bring an end to this war.

422
00:46:57,988 --> 00:47:01,116
That child has been
given to you.

423
00:47:04,036 --> 00:47:06,747
Certifiable.
You're certifiable.

424
00:47:07,831 --> 00:47:09,833
You... You...

425
00:47:09,917 --> 00:47:12,461
You're probably one of those guys
who, like, goes around...

426
00:47:12,544 --> 00:47:15,297
door-to-door selling bibles,
and you and your brothers... You have to believe me.

427
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:18,801
probably all wear white and
you probably have a Web site somewhere.

428
00:47:18,884 --> 00:47:21,637
And you probably bake brownies
on the weekend...

429
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:24,640
and you sell them to raise money
for your cause or your cult...

430
00:47:47,204 --> 00:47:49,873
Don't be afraid.

431
00:48:08,434 --> 00:48:13,272
Sir, did you notice any unusual
activity in the neighborhood tonight?

432
00:48:13,355 --> 00:48:17,568
I got a wrecked car
in the alley back there.
No, sir.

433
00:48:17,609 --> 00:48:21,321
So you didn't see anything,
hear anything. Is that about right?

434
00:48:21,405 --> 00:48:24,241
The fact is, officer,
I wasn't paying much attention.

435
00:48:24,324 --> 00:48:26,702
See, I was with
my woman.

436
00:48:26,785 --> 00:48:29,079
7-Charlie-63. Come in.

437
00:48:29,163 --> 00:48:33,041
Dorfman, come in.
Yeah, this is Dorfman.

438
00:48:33,125 --> 00:48:35,544
63, report to
Rosales residence.

439
00:48:35,627 --> 00:48:38,547
May I ask, you fellas use that
to what, talk to each other?

440
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:41,175
Yeah?
What, are you high?
It's a radio. Yeah.

441
00:48:41,258 --> 00:48:44,178
It's a miracle.
Shh.

442
00:48:44,261 --> 00:48:50,059
Do you read me, 63? 63, come in.

443
00:48:50,142 --> 00:48:53,854
Dorfman, where are you?
Come in. 63.

444
00:48:57,983 --> 00:49:00,152
Checking on the DMV report on the, uh...

445
00:49:00,235 --> 00:49:04,615
Okay. Pop quiz.
How do you make that work?

446
00:49:05,699 --> 00:49:07,659
How do you use that?

447
00:49:07,701 --> 00:49:10,662
Hmm?
We have nothing showing yet.

448
00:49:10,704 --> 00:49:13,248
Uh, Roger, dispatch.

449
00:49:26,845 --> 00:49:30,641
Are we having
a communication problem?

450
00:49:30,682 --> 00:49:33,977
What? Take it easy.

451
00:49:38,023 --> 00:49:39,942
Come here.

452
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:44,154
It's all right.
Come here. Come here.

453
00:49:44,238 --> 00:49:46,198
Don't be scared.
Here.

454
00:49:48,033 --> 00:49:49,952
Sit.

455
00:49:52,955 --> 00:49:56,166
I want to be with Julian.

456
00:49:56,250 --> 00:50:00,754
Please. Why can't you
just let me die?

457
00:50:00,838 --> 00:50:03,006
Let's understand
each other.

458
00:50:03,048 --> 00:50:07,761
I sang the first hymn
when stars were born.

459
00:50:07,845 --> 00:50:12,433
Not that long ago,
I announced to a young woman...

460
00:50:12,516 --> 00:50:16,937
Mary... who it was
she was expecting.

461
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:22,192
On the other hand,
I've turned rivers into blood.

462
00:50:23,944 --> 00:50:27,531
Kings into cripples.

463
00:50:27,614 --> 00:50:31,118
Cities to salt.

464
00:50:33,579 --> 00:50:38,208
So I don't think that I have
to explain myself to you.

465
00:50:46,049 --> 00:50:48,010
You have the child. You'd raise it.

466
00:50:48,093 --> 00:50:50,012
Maybe on his first
morning of school,

467
00:50:50,095 --> 00:50:52,681
you'd put him on a bus
and he wouldn't come back.

468
00:50:52,765 --> 00:50:55,851
Or maybe as a teen, he'd dive into
a pond and he wouldn't come up.

469
00:50:57,811 --> 00:51:00,230
And I was just supposed
to accept that?

470
00:51:02,191 --> 00:51:05,694
It's how you live here,
isn't it?

471
00:51:05,778 --> 00:51:09,156
Doesn't give you
the right to use me.

472
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:13,368
It wasn't my decision.
But it was your choice.

473
00:51:13,452 --> 00:51:17,247
I never had a choice,
Valerie.

474
00:51:17,289 --> 00:51:20,793
Listen, I have to
get you to Michael.

475
00:51:21,794 --> 00:51:25,297
Michael?
He can protect you.

476
00:51:26,381 --> 00:51:28,592
He's gone somewhere
with the others.

477
00:51:28,634 --> 00:51:31,762
I don't know where,
but we have to try to find him.

478
00:51:34,807 --> 00:51:39,019
There's a book that
a priest gave me.

479
00:51:39,103 --> 00:51:42,356
It had... It had prophecies
about your war.

480
00:51:42,439 --> 00:51:45,317
It might help you.

481
00:51:45,401 --> 00:51:47,903
Where is it?

482
00:51:47,986 --> 00:51:49,905
It's in my car.

483
00:51:53,367 --> 00:51:55,327
At my house.

484
00:51:55,369 --> 00:51:58,622
Can I ask you something?

485
00:51:58,664 --> 00:52:01,041
Yes.

486
00:52:01,125 --> 00:52:04,086
What are my chances?

487
00:52:04,169 --> 00:52:06,088
Be honest.

488
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:13,429
I don't know.

489
00:52:15,305 --> 00:52:19,977
But stay here.
He won't kill you in a church.

490
00:52:42,916 --> 00:52:48,756
Respond to Trinity Church,
2222 West in. Silent alarm tripped.

491
00:52:48,839 --> 00:52:51,091
All available units.
All available units.

492
00:52:51,175 --> 00:52:53,761
Please respond.
Wow. That's where I'd take her.

493
00:52:53,844 --> 00:52:56,638
I love this thing.

494
00:52:56,722 --> 00:52:58,640
Come on.

495
00:52:58,724 --> 00:53:02,895
Come on. Come on.
2222 West in. Trinity Church.

496
00:53:06,523 --> 00:53:08,776
Dispatch, this is 1 -Adam-19.

497
00:53:08,859 --> 00:53:11,779
Responding to the call
at Trinity Church.

498
00:53:11,862 --> 00:53:14,156
Roger that, 1-Adam-19.

499
00:53:23,123 --> 00:53:25,084
As soon as the coroner's through.

500
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,506
Can I get an I.D. on her?
Yeah. It's Rosales.

501
00:53:30,589 --> 00:53:32,508
Nina Rosales.

502
00:53:35,427 --> 00:53:38,389
Sir, please go
to the other side of the...
Shh.

503
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:40,933
It's okay.
You wanna help me
out here? Thanks.

504
00:54:35,654 --> 00:54:37,906
Be careful.

505
00:54:49,543 --> 00:54:52,588
I know you're here, Val.

506
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:56,425
I smell you.
I see you. Yeah.

507
00:54:59,011 --> 00:55:02,264
Why hide?

508
00:55:02,347 --> 00:55:04,767
I'm doing you a favor.

509
00:55:09,104 --> 00:55:11,774
What did Danyael
tell you...

510
00:55:11,857 --> 00:55:14,151
about your rug rat?

511
00:55:14,193 --> 00:55:17,112
1 -Adam-9.
Units 20 and 30 are responding.

512
00:55:17,196 --> 00:55:19,490
35-Adam-9.

513
00:55:19,573 --> 00:55:22,534
5-Lincoln-22.
Report to Vermont and Sunset, code 9.

514
00:55:22,576 --> 00:55:27,831
We've been through this before.
My kind, your kind.

515
00:55:27,873 --> 00:55:30,167
It's not a good mix.

516
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:33,378
The power of an angel.

517
00:55:33,462 --> 00:55:36,673
The free will
of a human.

518
00:55:36,757 --> 00:55:40,010
The mothers love it
at first...

519
00:55:40,052 --> 00:55:42,012
until the birth.

520
00:55:43,889 --> 00:55:48,560
I've seen women rip themselves open
trying to get these things out...

521
00:55:48,644 --> 00:55:52,439
'cause they knew they were
carrying bad kids, Val.

522
00:55:52,523 --> 00:55:56,985
Nobody liked them,
not even you-know-who.

523
00:56:03,492 --> 00:56:05,536
It took a big flood.

524
00:56:05,619 --> 00:56:08,205
I think we have to...

525
00:56:17,548 --> 00:56:21,510
So, since you're here...

526
00:56:29,601 --> 00:56:32,646
Confess. Say you're sorry.

527
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:54,042
Drop it!
Drop the weapon!

528
00:56:54,126 --> 00:56:56,086
Freeze!

529
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:59,214
Help me! Help me!

530
00:56:59,298 --> 00:57:02,176
Drop it right there!

531
00:57:02,259 --> 00:57:06,388
Gabriel!

532
00:57:06,472 --> 00:57:08,432
Hold it right there, sir!

533
00:57:08,474 --> 00:57:11,435
Freeze! Right there!

534
00:57:12,978 --> 00:57:14,938
He's got a weapon!

535
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:17,691
No, wait.

536
00:58:20,129 --> 00:58:21,839
Isabelle.

537
00:58:21,922 --> 00:58:24,341
Izzy.

538
00:58:25,551 --> 00:58:27,511
Izzy.

539
00:58:29,054 --> 00:58:33,142
You can be straight with us.
Come on.Just tell us who he is.

540
00:58:33,225 --> 00:58:35,394
The angel of death.

541
00:58:38,731 --> 00:58:41,734
I'll get some coffee.

542
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,711
Nice coat.

543
00:59:00,794 --> 00:59:02,963
So what was he up to
in the church?

544
00:59:03,046 --> 00:59:07,009
Trying to kill
the savior of humanity.

545
00:59:07,092 --> 00:59:09,011
Just ask him.

546
00:59:12,264 --> 00:59:14,558
What the...
Shh!

547
00:59:17,436 --> 00:59:21,148
Loose lips sink ships.

548
00:59:21,231 --> 00:59:25,069
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

549
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:27,488
What is that?

550
00:59:30,741 --> 00:59:33,702
That's tomorrow's newspaper.

551
00:59:33,786 --> 00:59:37,748
Huh? Come on.
Bad monkey. Come on, come on.

552
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:40,250
I don't know...
Hah?

553
00:59:42,461 --> 00:59:44,421
How?

554
00:59:45,631 --> 00:59:48,175
You don't even know where they are.
Yeah.

555
00:59:48,258 --> 00:59:52,096
But, I know where they're going.
Where?

556
00:59:52,179 --> 00:59:55,641
Where?

557
00:59:55,682 --> 00:59:57,726
Eden.

558
00:59:57,810 --> 01:00:01,188
I'll go get another car.

559
01:00:12,825 --> 01:00:16,745
Here.
Just take my hand.

560
01:00:16,829 --> 01:00:20,749
This is it?
This is Eden?

561
01:00:23,168 --> 01:00:27,297
What man
has made of it.

562
01:01:44,958 --> 01:01:48,545
Just her.
Michael wants to see her alone.

563
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:55,511
It's all right.

564
01:02:00,724 --> 01:02:02,851
Don't be afraid.

565
01:02:46,478 --> 01:02:49,022
It's your tradition too, isn't it?

566
01:02:50,816 --> 01:02:53,777
Lighting candles
for the dead?

567
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:56,280
Michael?

568
01:03:08,459 --> 01:03:10,377
What a dump!

569
01:03:17,634 --> 01:03:20,929
Gemayel.
Long time no see.

570
01:03:22,514 --> 01:03:26,435
Would you get
the big guy for me?

571
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:30,898
Don't eat that!

572
01:03:30,981 --> 01:03:33,025
Trust me.

573
01:03:36,028 --> 01:03:39,490
I've lit far too many
in this war.

574
01:03:42,367 --> 01:03:44,995
Is that one for me?

575
01:03:45,079 --> 01:03:49,291
It could be...
for all of us.

576
01:03:49,374 --> 01:03:52,795
Danyael said you
could protect me.

577
01:03:55,547 --> 01:04:00,761
If that were the case, this war
would have been over a long time ago.

578
01:04:02,554 --> 01:04:05,849
Are you telling me that I've come
all this way for nothing?

579
01:04:05,933 --> 01:04:10,187
If that's what you
want to believe, then yes.

580
01:04:11,563 --> 01:04:13,524
I can't believe that.

581
01:04:15,025 --> 01:04:16,860
Then don't.

582
01:04:36,797 --> 01:04:39,967
Ah... ah.

583
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:45,681
You've done wonders with the place,
I have to say. I hardly recognize it.

584
01:04:45,764 --> 01:04:51,603
Talk to me! Why fight?
I'm not here to argue.

585
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:54,982
We're family.
You know what I want.

586
01:04:55,065 --> 01:04:59,653
What you want has made you
a walking tragedy, brother.

587
01:04:59,737 --> 01:05:01,989
Even Lucifer
wouldn't have you.

588
01:05:02,072 --> 01:05:05,909
Surprising, since the two of you
have so much in common.

589
01:05:05,951 --> 01:05:11,415
What have I done? You speak to me that
way... How do you compare me to him?

590
01:05:13,041 --> 01:05:17,046
Everything I've done
has been for us.

591
01:05:17,129 --> 01:05:22,259
I don't want this.
I don't want this!

592
01:05:22,342 --> 01:05:27,848
I want it back the way it was,
when... when He loved us best.

593
01:05:27,931 --> 01:05:31,602
Then submit.
To what? A talking monkey?

594
01:05:31,643 --> 01:05:37,274
Obey, Gabriel. Or you'll be
called to a stricter punishment
than any of us ever known.

595
01:05:37,357 --> 01:05:39,276
I don't think so.

596
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:44,114
And, uh, it seems to me,
the numbers here speak differently.

597
01:05:55,084 --> 01:05:59,963
One way or the other,
this war ends tonight.

598
01:06:00,005 --> 01:06:04,009
You think you can take her,
Gabriel? Then come.

599
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:06,804
But your brothers
stay behind.

600
01:06:06,887 --> 01:06:11,141
No one will lift a hand
against you. I promise.

601
01:06:43,215 --> 01:06:46,969
Michael. Please,
you can't let him have her.

602
01:06:47,052 --> 01:06:50,514
Whether she lives or dies
is her choice, not ours.

603
01:06:50,597 --> 01:06:54,601
I'm not going to let her
die like this.

604
01:06:55,686 --> 01:06:58,605
Even if it means
disobeying me?

605
01:07:02,317 --> 01:07:04,236
Yes.

606
01:07:11,452 --> 01:07:13,370
This way.

607
01:07:15,622 --> 01:07:19,752
Valerie!
Danyael, Michael let him in.

608
01:07:19,835 --> 01:07:21,920
This way.

609
01:07:32,473 --> 01:07:35,517
Go ahead.
What about you?

610
01:07:39,605 --> 01:07:43,150
It's all come down
to you. Just go.

611
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:57,331
Ah. The honeymooner.

612
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:02,961
The price of freedom.
You know what to do.

613
01:08:09,802 --> 01:08:11,720
Come on!

614
01:08:42,084 --> 01:08:46,088
It's not that you slept with
that monkey-skin suit that gets me.

615
01:08:46,171 --> 01:08:48,132
It's that you liked it.

616
01:08:51,677 --> 01:08:53,887
What are you, in love?

617
01:08:53,971 --> 01:08:57,391
What do you know about love, Gabriel?

618
01:08:57,474 --> 01:08:59,727
It's wrong to go
against your family.

619
01:09:02,896 --> 01:09:07,818
You chose them. I want it back
the way it was. You want them?

620
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:12,072
I'd rather be
one of them.

621
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:17,161
Aaghh!

622
01:09:25,127 --> 01:09:27,755
It's too bad.

623
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:07,544
Hmm. Oh!
Thanks.

624
01:10:11,757 --> 01:10:14,385
It's about time.

625
01:10:14,468 --> 01:10:17,179
Nice move.

626
01:10:17,262 --> 01:10:20,224
I'll say hello
to Julian for you.

627
01:10:21,517 --> 01:10:24,895
You have no idea
what you're in for. Shh.

628
01:10:32,444 --> 01:10:35,322
Val, we don't have
to do this.

629
01:10:44,081 --> 01:10:47,209
Fuck you.

630
01:10:47,292 --> 01:10:49,586
Uuh!
Now you're gonna get hurt.

631
01:11:16,822 --> 01:11:19,283
Val, it's time to go.

632
01:11:19,324 --> 01:11:21,952
If He wanted me to die,

633
01:11:22,035 --> 01:11:25,748
He would've let you
kill me a long time ago.

634
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:45,350
This isn't about you.

635
01:11:45,434 --> 01:11:48,145
This is about
what you got there.

636
01:11:48,187 --> 01:11:52,316
The power of an angel,
the free will of a human being.

637
01:11:52,399 --> 01:11:58,113
All I want is what's mine.
Heaven. Have you been?

638
01:11:58,238 --> 01:12:00,991
It's paradise.

639
01:12:02,493 --> 01:12:06,663
One thing.
I'll let you go easy. Say it.

640
01:12:10,042 --> 01:12:15,839
You know He's not with you.
Say it.

641
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:21,220
When was the last time
that you and He spoke?

642
01:12:24,014 --> 01:12:25,933
Not lately.

643
01:12:28,727 --> 01:12:32,147
It's not that He doesn't talk
to you, you know.

644
01:12:32,231 --> 01:12:34,233
It's just that
you don't listen.

645
01:12:34,316 --> 01:12:37,236
How do you know?

646
01:12:40,364 --> 01:12:42,324
I can hear Him.

647
01:12:44,785 --> 01:12:47,371
What's He say?

648
01:12:49,039 --> 01:12:50,958
Jump.

649
01:14:19,671 --> 01:14:21,924
There is your answer,
brother.

650
01:14:34,937 --> 01:14:38,857
So you'll become
what you loathe the most.

651
01:14:41,026 --> 01:14:42,986
Good-bye, Gabriel.

652
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:04,800
So, what happens now?

653
01:15:06,677 --> 01:15:09,471
I can't see into the future,
Valerie.

654
01:15:12,182 --> 01:15:14,893
You're gonna take my child
when it comes, aren't you?

655
01:15:20,899 --> 01:15:23,944
He was the only one
of you worth anything.

656
01:15:24,027 --> 01:15:27,156
He was the only one
who cared.

657
01:15:27,197 --> 01:15:30,659
His child deserves
better than you.

658
01:15:33,245 --> 01:15:35,205
I'm keeping him.

659
01:15:35,247 --> 01:15:37,624
I'm raising him.

660
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:41,420
And maybe one day,
he'll get on the school bus,

661
01:15:41,503 --> 01:15:44,006
and he
won't come back.

662
01:15:44,089 --> 01:15:47,718
And maybe one day,
he'll dive into a lake,

663
01:15:47,801 --> 01:15:49,720
and he won't come up.

664
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:53,182
I'll take my chances.

665
01:15:54,224 --> 01:15:57,186
It's not yours to decide,
Michael.

666
01:16:38,977 --> 01:16:41,939
Mom, when's vacation?

667
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:45,401
Well, you have one month,
and then you have the whole summer off.

668
01:16:45,526 --> 01:16:49,905
Can we start now?
No, you can't start now.

669
01:16:57,579 --> 01:17:03,168
Oh, I never like leaving her.
They'll be fine.

670
01:17:03,293 --> 01:17:05,212
You just
gotta have faith.

671
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:25,399
Oh, honey, just let me give this.

672
01:17:29,695 --> 01:17:31,780
There you go.
How are ya?

673
01:17:31,822 --> 01:17:33,824
I'm fine.
You stay warm now.

674
01:17:35,701 --> 01:17:37,578
Thanks a lot.
Take care.

675
01:17:37,703 --> 01:17:40,122
Why you always so nice to that guy?

676
01:17:40,164 --> 01:17:42,791
I think he's sweet.
He says he used to be an angel.

677
01:17:42,916 --> 01:17:46,545
Phone's gonna ring.

678
01:17:46,628 --> 01:17:48,672
It's gonna be
you-know-who.

679
01:17:50,466 --> 01:17:52,384
Everything's gonna
be made right.

680
01:17:56,305 --> 01:17:58,307
Phone's gonna ring.
