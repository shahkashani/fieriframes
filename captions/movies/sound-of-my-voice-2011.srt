1
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:37,286
3438.

2
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,954
This is it.

3
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,706
Pull into the driveway.

4
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,960
Use the remote to open the garage.

5
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:56,388
Do not exit the vehicle.
Close the garage door behind you.

6
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,155
Wait for further instructions.

7
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:55,948
Follow me.

8
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:02,204
Be thorough with the soap.

9
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:31,275
Eleven workers lost their lives.

10
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,902
Seventeen others were injured.

11
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,530
And soon,
nearly a mile beneath the surface...

12
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,407
Stand.
... of the ocean, oil began...

13
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,617
... spewing into the water.
Your records?

14
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:43,245
Because there's never been a leak...

15
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,789
Hold on to that.
... this size at this depth...

16
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,584
...stopping it has tested the limits
of human technology.

17
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,754
That's why just after the rig sank,
I assembled a team...

18
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:57,092
...of our nation's best scientists
and engineers to tackle this challenge....

19
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:27,581
Step up. watch your head.

20
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,249
Let me see your hand.

21
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,590
Finally, Peter.

22
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,091
Welcome.

23
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:15,290
Let's gather round. Take a seat.

24
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:23,006
First I'd like to say
welcome to our new members.

25
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:28,929
As is our custom, they have been
preparing on the outside for some time...

26
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:32,099
...but now we feel
they are ready to graduate...

27
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,477
...and to join us.

28
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:39,439
So let me introduce Peter
and his girlfriend, Lorna.

29
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:43,568
And this is Christine and her husband, Lam.

30
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,446
Now, let me say a word to you new folk.

31
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,491
No sudden movements.

32
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,411
And no questions for tonight.

33
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:58,625
The first night is always the most difficult.

34
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,878
But as our other members here can attest...

35
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,716
...an unforgettable experience.

36
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,802
Okay.

37
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,139
Maggie.

38
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,246
Hi.

39
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,670
It's nice to see new faces.

40
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:30,675
Thank you all for taking the precautions
to come here.

41
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,804
It shows you have a great deal of faith.

42
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:41,811
Now let me return that trust...

43
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,606
...in telling you my story.

44
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,780
Like anything new...

45
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,951
...it will be impossible
for your mind to digest.

46
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,578
Maybe close your eyes.

47
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,456
Try opening up. Here.

48
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,502
Try listening from your heart.

49
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:17,597
Two years ago, I woke up underwater.

50
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,814
It was a bathtub,
filled about three-quarters high.

51
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,984
I was gasping for breath.

52
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,402
Coughing up...

53
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,655
...snorting out this water.

54
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,372
I felt this...

55
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,751
...terrible sense of loss.

56
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:53,675
Like when you wake up from dreaming
about someone you love so much.

57
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:58,138
And you turn around in bed and remember...

58
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,808
...that they've been dead for years.

59
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,359
What was I doing in that motel room?

60
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:23,538
I remembered my name, my birthday.
October 31st.

61
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,541
Nothing else.

62
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,587
I ended up out on the streets.

63
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:36,843
As people with no ID...

64
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,721
...no money...

65
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,808
...no memories do.

66
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,395
I felt really lonely.

67
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,814
And exhausted all the time.

68
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:54,194
My immune system was gone.

69
00:10:54,987 --> 00:11:00,241
At that time, my legs and my right arm
would fall asleep.

70
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,788
Like in meditation, you know, but for hours.

71
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,251
And I couldn't wake them up.
They were strangers to me.

72
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:14,422
And I couldn't remember anything.

73
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,762
But I still had to wake up every day,
still had to keep going.

74
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:26,226
I had no idea who I was
or what I was doing here.

75
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,814
And that's when Klaus found me.

76
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:38,113
He had heard about me from others.
Had heard of my tattoos.

77
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,450
And he took me in.

78
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,287
And he fed me.

79
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,124
And he gave me vitamins.

80
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,420
In about three or four weeks...

81
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,800
...I started to remember things.

82
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,889
Many terrible things.

83
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,643
Violent images.

84
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:12,021
I was so angry.

85
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,983
I thought I'd lost my mind.

86
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,611
And then Klaus explained it to me.

87
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:22,991
My tattoos. This failing body.

88
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,119
The things I'd remembered.
What it all meant.

89
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:30,248
Open your eyes.
I wanna show you something.

90
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:35,962
You see, the anchor is the sign of a traveler.

91
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:41,342
And the number 54
refers to where I come from.

92
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,015
You see, I come from 54.

93
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,520
2054.

94
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,026
Your future.

95
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,827
Did we get anything?
Nothing. Static.

96
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,663
We didn't get a single frame?
We went out of range.

97
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,207
Damn it.

98
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,553
What's the matter?
Nothing.

99
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:30,016
You're, like, shaking.
I'm not shaking, Peter. I'm a little racy.

100
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,937
It's just a bunch of crap, Lorna.

101
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,522
Yeah, I know.

102
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:40,068
They're weak
and they're looking for meaning.

103
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,779
Yeah.

104
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:46,324
You know, those people are suckers.
That's it.

105
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,831
But what if she is?

106
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,793
What? From the future?

107
00:13:56,961 --> 00:14:00,380
Uh, no one is from the future, Lorna.

108
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,759
Well, then who is she?

109
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:08,930
She's a con artist. She's dangerous.

110
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,932
That's why we gotta make this film.

111
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:17,981
We have to expose her before
she has all those people kill themselves.

112
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:26,155
I've gotta take a leak.

113
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,788
Are you okay?
You don't wanna come with me?

114
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:06,654
Peter Aitken likes math, reason, himself.

115
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,324
Things he can count on.

116
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:14,829
When Peter was 12,
his mother was diagnosed with cancer.

117
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:18,666
A longtime member of a New Age cult...

118
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:24,172
...she believed that modern medicine
shouldn't intervene in her fate.

119
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:30,136
She died on the eve of Peter's birthday,
while they were both asleep.

120
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,306
Peter awoke 13 and motherless.

121
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:43,816
We began by preparing on the outside...

122
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,819
...meeting at weekly intervals...

123
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:49,781
...at the West Court shopping strip mall...

124
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,868
...with 20 other new recruits
that were eventually weeded down.

125
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:57,246
Couldn't tell the exact location
of the house.

126
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:01,209
By my count, we were in the van
for approximately 20 minutes...

127
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:05,546
...but it's possible that they were giving us
the runaround, so....

128
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,548
Hey.
Hey.

129
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:13,221
To see her is to believe her.
But of course, that's how these cons work.

130
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:17,392
Even if the new recruits doubt her story,
they'll be back for more.

131
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,729
I'm trying to work. Please?

132
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:24,524
Maggie says
that the future is already written...

133
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:29,821
...and that her members
are the chosen ones.

134
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,740
Peter Aitken signing off.

135
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,611
Good morning, everybody.

136
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:17,785
Uh, Miss Parker had her baby,
so she will be out for a couple months.

137
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:21,956
And that means
you guys are stuck with me, Mr. Aitken.

138
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,624
So, what will it be, ladies?

139
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:30,214
We have the American Civil War
or the anatomy of a cell?

140
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:41,934
Lorna?

141
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,229
Lorna.

142
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,231
Lorna.
What?

143
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,775
Lorna Michaelson.

144
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,486
Daughter of Hollywood producer
Isaac Michaelson...

145
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,989
...and Allie Bernard,
the British model turned actress.

146
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:58,659
Lorna was left to an unchaperoned
adolescence of movie premieres...

147
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,369
...and club openings.

148
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:05,792
Lorna had her first hangover at 12,
her first intervention at 16.

149
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:10,671
By 23 she was burnt out,
tired of playing entourage.

150
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,007
So Lorna cleaned up her act.

151
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:16,302
Tequila shots replaced with
wheatgrass shots.

152
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,430
But in the end, it was one addiction
traded for another.

153
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,265
Lorna.

154
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,696
Watch your head.

155
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:49,377
Shake it out. Shake it out now.

156
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:52,046
You are fools.

157
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:56,259
Your muscles are tight
with repressed feelings.

158
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,970
Who you were before is irrelevant.

159
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:03,224
Let go of you, become the group.

160
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,855
I have to exhaust you people...

161
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:14,986
...to get you to stop thinking
and start breathing.

162
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,269
Don't be worried.

163
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,688
Maggie's tests will get harder.

164
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:54,400
But if you pass,
then you're meant to be with us.

165
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:58,279
Then you will be ready when it begins.

166
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,870
This is where we grow Maggie's food.

167
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,456
Go on, pick one.

168
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,251
Okay.

169
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,464
Are you good?
Yeah, fine. Do it.

170
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,924
Just think about Maggie.

171
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:30,811
She's allergic to absolutely everything
in this time period.

172
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,941
You can eat these?
Of course you can, kiddo. Heh.

173
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,944
It's the grocery store
you've gotta be wary of.

174
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,906
Produce grown by
someone you've never met...

175
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,159
...sitting in trucks for weeks...

176
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,453
...sprayed with, I don't know,
who knows what.

177
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,206
Yeah, but these aren't
exactly natural either.

178
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:54,001
Well, true. But Maggie says
when prices go up...

179
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,921
...people will start growing gardens
in their garages.

180
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:01,300
We'll be all right though.
Maggie's taking us to a safe place.

181
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:08,224
Maggie? Are you dying?

182
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,977
Yeah.

183
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,606
So are you. So is PJ.

184
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,694
Joanne's dying. Peter's dying.

185
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,363
Lorna's dying.

186
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,491
Every life is a death.

187
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,286
And most deaths are suicides.

188
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:35,042
Some are more gradual than others,
like cancer after years of smoking.

189
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,546
Or in my case...

190
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:42,800
...traveling back in time
to save the people you love.

191
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:47,346
Even if you kiss him as you leave the room

192
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:52,727
And even if we don't say a word
In front of them

193
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:58,274
And even if we never get to show our friends

194
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:04,488
Is that Abigail Pritchett?
At least three episodes a week.

195
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,576
Maybe she has narcolepsy.

196
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,955
She's always in that hat.

197
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:39,607
Okay, I bring you some hot milk. Okay?

198
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,623
Can you look at me
for a second there, Lorna?

199
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:44,755
Hello, Peter.

200
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,799
Hmm.

201
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:56,517
Okay. well, this transmitter records
everything from the camera...

202
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,687
...but would go out of range
outside of 50 feet.

203
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:04,233
So how in the world
do we bring this with us?

204
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:13,701
Peter. No way.
Well, people need to see this.

205
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,662
People need to see a video of Maggie.

206
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,041
Peter, that's too big to swallow.
Don't swallow that.

207
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,044
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

208
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,714
Eat this.

209
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,885
Give it some padding
so it won't tear you up on the way out.

210
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,742
Are you okay?

211
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,913
Not sure.

212
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:00,956
Yeah. Ahem.

213
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,620
Close your eyes.

214
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:49,171
Go backwards to childhood.

215
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:54,468
Travel back to a time before words.

216
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,470
Are you there?

217
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,724
What does it smell like?

218
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,353
What does it taste like?

219
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,982
How do you feel?

220
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:10,776
Now live there.

221
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,834
Okay, come back to me.
Come back to the present.

222
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,670
Now you can eat your apple.

223
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,683
Do you know what's in that apple?

224
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,187
Logic.

225
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:50,024
Bitterness.

226
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,359
It's intellectual bullshit.

227
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,363
You've already eaten the apple.

228
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,866
That's what it means to grow up.

229
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,201
The question is...

230
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,788
...how much of it can you get rid of?

231
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,962
The apple is in you.

232
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:15,549
Like the fear is in you.

233
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:20,554
It's spreading throughout your body
like a virus.

234
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:26,226
How can we purge ourselves of shame...

235
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:29,897
...of self-hatred...

236
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:34,234
...and rise to our callings as chosen ones?

237
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:41,533
You all have the privilege
of knowing the future.

238
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,415
But are you gonna be ready for it?

239
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,720
Pathetic.

240
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:21,782
See how committed Christine is.

241
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,554
You're purifying yourself.

242
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,891
Preparing to receive your destiny.

243
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,942
Feels good to be rid of the apple, doesn't it?

244
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,741
Peter, there's no rush. We'll wait for you.

245
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:07,161
Thanks, but I can't throw up. Uh....

246
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:10,497
Never have, not even as a kid. So....

247
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:14,001
All the more reason to let go now.

248
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:26,346
Just let it go, Peter.

249
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,682
Just relax.

250
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:33,520
And let it come up and out.

251
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,151
Lorna.
Sit down.

252
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,454
Lorna's fine.

253
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,875
She's just protecting you.

254
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:59,046
Do you wanna be a cripple
for life, Peter?

255
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,217
You're letting her be your crutch.

256
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,677
Do you like being lame?

257
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,681
Ask yourself...

258
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,978
...why do I like being lame?

259
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:17,064
Ask yourself.

260
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,484
Ask yourself now. Say it.

261
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,987
Say, "Why do I like being lame?"

262
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,909
Um....

263
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,161
Why do I like being lame?

264
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:34,915
That's a good question.

265
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,210
Why do you like being lame?

266
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,756
I don't know.
Liar.

267
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,263
You do know.

268
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:59,940
We don't have anywhere to go.
Do we?

269
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,693
No.

270
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:07,114
We'll all just sit here breathing in the
smell of everyone's puke until you can talk.

271
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,741
Because I don't wanna face myself.

272
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,369
Okay. why?

273
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,621
Because I might not....

274
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:20,127
I might not like what I see.
What do you see?

275
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:24,631
Weakness.

276
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,676
Tell me something I don't already know.

277
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,646
You wanna know what I see?

278
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,274
An anal-retentive prick.

279
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:46,278
Who can't dance, who can't breathe.

280
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,405
Stop it.
Can't make his girlfriend come...

281
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,324
...because he's so self-involved.

282
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:02,169
Who took your power away from you?

283
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:08,550
Who made you feel so powerless
you've become obsessed with control?

284
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:14,348
With thinking everything through
instead of feeling anything.

285
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,684
Who?

286
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:24,358
Who hurt you so much
you never wanna feel that way again?

287
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,822
Was it your father?

288
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,370
Was it your mother?
Shut up.

289
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,623
Shut the fuck up, you fucking cunt.

290
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,895
What are you hiding from me, Peter?

291
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,569
She abandon you?

292
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:13,073
She leave you to start another family?

293
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,450
Was she a whore?
I'll hit you.

294
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:19,579
I'll hit you in the face.
What'd she do to make you so angry?

295
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:22,416
Shut up. This is so stupid.
What'd she do to you?

296
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:26,378
What'd she do to you?
She gave up.

297
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:28,505
She died.

298
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,217
I was a kid. And she died.

299
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,721
She's dead. Everybody happy?

300
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,107
What happened next?

301
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,903
You live with your dad?

302
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,908
Did you live in a foster home?

303
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,787
No.
Who took care of you?

304
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,042
My grandparents.

305
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,463
I see.

306
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:17,137
You were a good-looking kid,
weren't you?

307
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,683
You're handsome now.

308
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:28,023
But you must have been beautiful then.

309
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:34,154
You were in a new house.

310
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,784
A new bedroom.

311
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:41,244
You felt abandoned.

312
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:45,624
Angry. Unloved.

313
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,631
Did he come to you at night?

314
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:57,511
No, of course not.

315
00:34:57,678 --> 00:35:00,305
She watched him like a hawk,
didn't she?

316
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,107
He wait for you after school?

317
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,405
You were all alone.

318
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:22,035
Fresh as the fallen snow.

319
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:25,122
And he knew.

320
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,878
Did he make you swallow his poison?

321
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:55,193
You were powerless then.

322
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:59,531
But you're not anymore.

323
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:06,079
You can let go of it, here, with us.

324
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:08,248
Peter.

325
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:12,752
It's not my choice, it's yours.

326
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,554
Let it go.

327
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,279
You're brave.

328
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,399
Thank you.

329
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,744
Are you okay?

330
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:31,539
Mm-hm. Yeah, I'm fine.

331
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,510
Okay. I know that
we just wanna start our day...

332
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,388
... but if we don't talk about it...
Talk about what?

333
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:50,016
What do you wanna talk about?
I don't know. I mean....

334
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,521
I guess I've never seen you cry.

335
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,941
Those weren't real tears.

336
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,361
But they weren't fake.
Yes, they were. They were fake tears.

337
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:05,532
She's a megalomaniac, Lorna.
She knew things about you.

338
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,536
No. She didn't know anything about me.
She asked questions about me.

339
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:13,957
She wanted to be right
and I let her think she was.

340
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,876
So all that stuff was...?
It was not true.

341
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,546
Come on. Of course it wasn't true.

342
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:25,051
I'm sorry.

343
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,220
I'm sorry If I scared you...

344
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:30,807
...but I had to do what I had to do
to get us out of there.

345
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:35,228
Peter, I just feel like we're in over our heads
with this whole thing, you know?

346
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:40,442
It's like we started out wanting to make
a documentary on cults.

347
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:45,238
And now we're in one?
Yeah. That's investigative journalism.

348
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:50,118
She's dangerous, Peter.
You said that yourself.

349
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:54,080
What do you wanna do?
You wanna go back to our normal lives.

350
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:57,000
That's fine. We can do that.
I can teach all day.

351
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,669
You can stay home
and write and surf the web.

352
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:03,631
And on the weekends we can get wasted
at various art installations...

353
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:06,468
...or sneak forties into random foreign films.

354
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:10,430
And then it's suddenly, like, we wake up
and, whoops, where did our 20s go?

355
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,599
But somewhere in the Valley...

356
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:16,311
...there is a woman living in a basement
who claims to be from the future.

357
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,313
She's actually amassing followers.

358
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:23,902
These people who believe that
she'll lead them to salvation or whatever.

359
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,446
And, yes, she's dangerous...

360
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,783
...but we have to see this thing through
all the way or we're chumps.

361
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,793
Don't you wanna do something
that matters?

362
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,295
Yes.

363
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,590
Let's do it.

364
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,511
We're a team.
We're a team?

365
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:53,014
Oh, we are totally a team.

366
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:57,394
I'm doing this with you.
Yeah.

367
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:12,111
So after my husband up
and left me...

368
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:14,697
...I wore the same pair
of sweatpants for two years.

369
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:19,327
It was Maggie who got me to see
that humans belong in the woods...

370
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:22,539
... and not in condos.
Yeah. I'm glad that you called.

371
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,208
This is good.
Yeah, it feels good, don't it?

372
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:29,128
Hey, come here.
I wanna show you something.

373
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,301
After you.

374
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:39,305
Well, maybe we shouldn't go in
all the way because I have to be back.

375
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:43,268
Oh, come on, you'll like this.
Come on.

376
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:57,490
I do the La Brea Tar Pits field trip.

377
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:03,997
I said, you wanna run a trip, you do
the paperwork yourself, like everyone else.

378
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,165
Trying to steal my trip.

379
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:07,917
Give me that!

380
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:10,461
Heidi, Stop it. What in the world?

381
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:12,755
Heidi, I said stop it. Get off.

382
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:16,509
She ruined my backpack. It's new.

383
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:20,221
Get back to work. Get back to work.
The show is over.

384
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:21,431
What's happened here?

385
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,101
My backpack. She wrote.

386
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,486
You okay?

387
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,364
Here. I'll help you up.

388
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,959
Joanne?

389
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,378
I need to get back.

390
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:55,798
We're here.
Can't turn around now.

391
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,009
Here.

392
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:07,727
Why do you have a gun?

393
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:12,231
Joanne. This is weird, okay?
Hey.

394
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:15,401
I would just like to go.
Okay. Calm down.

395
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:19,405
Trust, Lorna. It is very important
that we trust each other.

396
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,908
We're family now.

397
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,870
First rule.

398
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:29,082
Always treat a gun as if it's loaded,
even if it's not.

399
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:30,833
Always keep it pointed down.

400
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:35,088
That's how you keep from
killing somebody or yourself.

401
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,517
Okay, you try it.

402
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,061
I'd rather just watch you.
Come on.

403
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:53,564
Don't be silly. I loaded it for you.

404
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:57,944
Yeah, but I just don't feel comfortable.
Nonsense. It's important.

405
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,615
Okay. Legs apart.

406
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,617
Come on.

407
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,413
Okay, now remember...

408
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:11,791
...push with the right hand,
pull with the left.

409
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:14,585
Okay? Keeps you steady.

410
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:49,829
Hi.
I texted you.

411
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,998
My phone died.

412
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:57,587
You wanna make huevos rancheros?
So, what happened with Joanne?

413
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:01,924
Oh, my God. She took me on a hike
through the woods...

414
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,509
...to this shooting range.

415
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:07,180
But it turns out I'm actually pretty good at it.

416
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:10,266
Uh, why is Joanne teaching
you how to shoot a gun?

417
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:15,146
I don't know, fun?
That's fun?

418
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:18,691
What do you think?

419
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:21,277
I don't know what to think.
That's the problem.

420
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:24,197
We don't know who these people are,
what they're capable of.

421
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:28,576
What's this "safe place" that Maggie
keeps talking about bringing us to?

422
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:33,599
Um, I was just wondering.

423
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:40,022
What's it gonna be like
when the civil war starts?

424
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,191
Things come together.

425
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:46,529
And they fall apart.

426
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:52,034
It's a really dark time.

427
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,788
My generation is really comfortable
with death.

428
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:59,625
And people die around you all the time.

429
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:03,296
But there's still beauty.

430
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:06,173
Especially when people start moving
to the countryside.

431
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:10,553
There's dancing and theater.

432
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,305
Lovemaking.

433
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:16,601
Are there still, like, CDs or MP3s
or something?

434
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,562
Um....

435
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:23,566
Not everybody has access
to that kind of technology...

436
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:28,446
...so there's not as many recorded albums...

437
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,615
...but there's a lot of live music.

438
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,326
But every once in a while...

439
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:37,663
...a song will come along
that moves everyone.

440
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:43,002
And that finds a way of getting around.
Even without MP3s.

441
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,129
Will you sing us something from your time?

442
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,465
No.
Come on.

443
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:49,634
I don't sing.
Come on, please?

444
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:52,094
Yeah, yeah.
Just one song.

445
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:55,348
We wanna hear the future.
You wanna what the future...?

446
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:57,433
Yeah.
what the future sounds like?

447
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,143
Uh....

448
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,190
Okay.

449
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,692
Uh....

450
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:10,529
This song was really popular
right before I left.

451
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:16,035
I'm so sorry. I can't. Sorry.

452
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:18,371
We'll close our eyes.
Yeah.

453
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:19,580
Mm-hm.

454
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:24,043
Okay.

455
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:42,061
<i>Oh, my life</i>

456
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:47,525
<i>Is changing every day</i>

457
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:53,072
<i>In every possible way</i>

458
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:58,744
<i>Oh, my dreams</i>

459
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:07,211
<i>It's never quite as it seems</i>

460
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:15,177
<i>Now I tell you openly</i>

461
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:21,100
<i>You have my heart so don't hurt me</i>

462
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:26,856
<i>For what I couldn't find</i>

463
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:32,778
<i>Totally amazing mind</i>

464
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:37,450
<i>So understanding and so kind</i>

465
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,787
<i>You're everything to me</i>

466
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:47,918
Do you wanna try singing
the last with me?

467
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:50,713
It goes:

468
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:54,383
Oh, my life

469
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:59,972
<i>Is changing every day</i>

470
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:04,477
<i>In every possible way</i>

471
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:10,816
<i>In all my dreams</i>

472
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:15,571
<i>It's never quite as it seems</i>

473
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:19,450
<i>'Cause you're a dream to me</i>

474
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:22,161
<i>Dream to me</i>

475
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,959
Thanks.
Yeah. That was good.

476
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:31,837
Maggie?

477
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:35,132
I, uh.... I mean no disrespect.

478
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:40,137
But that song, you know...
I'm sure you know, is by The Cranberries.

479
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:45,684
It was from, like, the '90s.

480
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:47,603
The 1990s.

481
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:52,024
Oh, that could be.

482
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:54,693
I wouldn't know
because I wasn't alive in the '90s.

483
00:51:56,029 --> 00:52:00,866
In the future, it's made famous
by a singer named Benetton.

484
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:05,621
Can you tell us something
from the future that we could prove?

485
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,373
Something soon.

486
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:08,999
Huh.

487
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:16,298
When were you born?
Seventy-nine.

488
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,300
Okay.

489
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:22,805
Prove to me that you were alive in the '80s.

490
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:26,851
Tell me something that happened
in the spring of 1959.

491
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:29,061
What?

492
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,564
I was born in 2030.

493
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:36,026
You're asking me to tell you something
that happens in 2010.

494
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:38,696
That's twenty years before I'm born.

495
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,240
So I'm asking you to do the same.

496
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:47,079
Tell me something that happens
in the spring of 1959.

497
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:48,414
Uh....

498
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:53,252
Kennedy was assassinated.
In 1963.

499
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,422
That's four years from 1959.

500
00:52:56,590 --> 00:53:00,342
You want me to tell you something
you can prove in 2014?

501
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,595
Would that make you happy?

502
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:09,185
What will you do with yourself until then?

503
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:16,859
I could tell you a major event a few years off.

504
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:21,780
And after that it's gonna be
event after event after event.

505
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:25,993
But a mind as narrow as yours...

506
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:29,955
...would have no idea
what to do with that information.

507
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,419
You may go now, Lam.

508
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:39,632
I was just.... I didn't...

509
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:41,258
Let's go.
Wait.

510
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:45,638
Christine, you're gonna have to decide
what you wanna do here.

511
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:47,640
Christie.

512
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:56,232
Christie, she's lying. It's obvious.

513
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,901
You're all crazy!

514
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,409
I can't get that song out of my head.

515
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,081
Ah, neither can I.

516
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:14,708
If you were gonna pick
a song to be from the future...

517
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:18,504
...why would it be "Dreams"
by The Cranberries?

518
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:22,883
Remove Peter's restraints, please.

519
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:30,099
If you'll come with me, please, Peter,
Maggie will see you.

520
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,935
Just Peter, Lorna.
Okay.

521
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:38,607
I'll wait here.
No need. we'll drive you home.

522
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,309
Enter.

523
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:23,569
You can sit down.

524
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,336
Ah.

525
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:06,111
I'm from the future. I'm not a saint.

526
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:28,342
Are you and Lorna happy here with us?
Yes.

527
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:31,970
Yes. Of course we are.
People leave.

528
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:35,432
Other people I kick out...

529
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:40,771
...because they're sick or lazy.

530
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:46,777
You're neither one of those, are you?
No. No, I'm not.

531
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:49,238
Do you know why
I kicked Lam out?

532
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:52,324
Because he questioned you?

533
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,160
No.

534
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:57,454
I'm not petty.

535
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:01,542
I don't really care if people believe me.

536
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:05,671
I don't know that I would
if I was in their shoes.

537
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:10,634
Well, why'd you kick him out?
Because I knew Christine growing up.

538
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:16,807
But I never saw Lam.
I don't think he belonged with us.

539
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,351
Are Lorna and I there?

540
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,813
That's for you to decide.

541
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:25,149
We wanna be there.

542
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:32,030
Will you do me a favor?
Anything.

543
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:33,740
Yeah?

544
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:59,683
This is Abigail Pritchett.

545
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,604
I don't understand.

546
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:06,482
I need you to bring her to me.

547
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,698
Uh.... Are you joking?

548
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:21,830
What would you want
with an 8-year-old girl?

549
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,874
Don't worry about that.

550
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:29,171
Well, there's no way that I'm bringing
a little girl into this basement. That's....

551
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:32,716
Then perhaps you and Lorna should
stay away from this basement as well.

552
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,093
You don't mean that.

553
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:38,388
I need to see Abigail Pritchett.

554
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:40,182
Why?

555
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:44,520
Bring her to me and stay, or don't and go.

556
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:49,608
There has to be something else
I can do to prove my loyalty.

557
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:51,443
There isn't.

558
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:53,946
It has to cost something
to be worth something.

559
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:57,115
You are asking me to kidnap
an 8-year-old child.

560
00:58:57,283 --> 00:59:00,244
Not kidnap.
I could get fired or arrested.

561
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:01,453
I need to know why.

562
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:04,706
She's important.
How?

563
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:11,797
She's a very bright little girl.
What do you want with her?

564
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:14,258
Just to see her.
For what?

565
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,301
Because I need to.
Need to?

566
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:19,638
Who is she?

567
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,643
Abigail Pritchett is my mother.

568
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,905
Okay.

569
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:39,783
Time for bed.

570
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:46,832
Come on.

571
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:52,504
That's okay. Come on.

572
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:12,941
Okay.

573
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:37,591
So?

574
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:41,428
So....

575
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:47,768
She wants me to bring her
one of my students.

576
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:49,895
Wait. what?
Yeah.

577
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:52,064
Abigail Pritchett.

578
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,568
Did she say why?

579
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:58,528
Yeah.

580
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:03,659
Maggie claims that the girl is her mom.

581
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:11,124
Well, how did they even know
that you worked at the school?

582
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:15,545
I don't know. I must have mentioned it.

583
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:21,760
I think we should go to the police.

584
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:23,220
Police?
Yeah.

585
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:27,683
Yeah. Um, hello, Officer Randal.

586
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:30,811
Yes? Hello.
I'd like to report a time-traveler...

587
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:33,897
...living in a basement somewhere.
I don't know where exactly.

588
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:36,733
They want you to bring them
an 8-year-old.

589
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:38,610
That's kidnapping.

590
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:40,612
I know that and I'd be the one doing it.

591
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:43,782
So, what are they gonna arrest her for?
Soliciting blood?

592
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:46,493
Okay. So you're...?
All right, let me get this straight.

593
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:49,579
So you're actually considering
bringing them the girl?

594
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,373
No. No.

595
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,045
Are you?
No, no, no.

596
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:59,965
It's a test. If we don't do this,
they're gonna kick us out.

597
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,719
Are you listening to yourself?
You always do this.

598
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:06,096
What do I always do?
What are you talking about?

599
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:10,308
You sign up for things and then you bail
when the going gets rough.

600
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:13,645
What are you talking about?
You. About finishing what we started.

601
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:16,857
You start novels you never finish.
Take pictures you never develop.

602
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:19,818
Finish what you fucking start.
You fucking started this.

603
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:24,406
I'm willing to go all the way.
How far are you gonna go?

604
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:27,242
And how are you any different
from your mother?

605
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:30,328
That's a cheap shot.
Yeah?

606
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:32,789
Not if it had been delivered by Maggie.

607
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:35,167
Oh, come on.
What?

608
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:37,586
I see the way that you look at her, Peter.

609
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:40,005
Pssh. You're kidding, right?
No, I'm not.

610
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:41,757
Are you jealous of that fraud?

611
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:43,675
Why not?

612
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:45,594
She's beautiful.

613
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:48,638
Mesmerizing.

614
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:54,102
In 15 minutes she brought you
to an emotional orgasm...

615
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:56,354
...that I've never seen in three years, Peter.

616
01:02:56,522 --> 01:02:58,440
"Emotional orgasm"? what the fuck is that?

617
01:02:58,608 --> 01:02:59,691
You tell me.

618
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:01,860
You people. You people make me laugh.

619
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,695
Who is "you people"?
You people...

620
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:06,990
... Who spend a fucking fortune on therapy.
You could use some.

621
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:09,743
Rehab. You think because
you put in these man-hours...

622
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:12,370
...you're somehow entitled
to a degree in psychology?

623
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:13,705
You're now this expert?

624
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:18,251
When the truth is, after all those hours,
you fuckups are just arriving at the place...

625
01:03:18,419 --> 01:03:21,046
...the rest of us have been at all our lives.

626
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:26,551
You know what I think, Peter?
I think it's you who's the fuckup.

627
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:30,555
You haven't logged tapes
or captured any fucking footage in weeks.

628
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:33,642
Yeah. You don't give a shit
about making this documentary.

629
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:36,561
This is about Maggie.
You're willing to do anything for her.

630
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:38,897
You just said that yourself.

631
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:42,150
So you know what?
I'm not gonna stand in your way.

632
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:45,362
I'm gonna help you pack.

633
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,239
What are you doing?
What am I doing?

634
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:48,532
Get out!

635
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,538
I'm sorry.

636
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:57,374
We make a horrible team.

637
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:02,671
Either you stay or you go

638
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:07,676
But you can't stand there no more

639
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:12,889
My heart is burning but I

640
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:17,894
I know I started to cry

641
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:22,190
And even when I get home

642
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:28,572
I can still smell you in my clothes

643
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:32,117
And I won't pack them away

644
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:38,707
I stutter, I stutter
But just not today

645
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:44,588
Klaus, it's Peter.

646
01:04:44,755 --> 01:04:47,173
Tell Maggie I'll do it.

647
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:21,583
It can't be as bad as all that.

648
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:27,172
You wanna talk about it?

649
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:29,215
No.

650
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:31,468
Thank you.

651
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:33,762
He'll come around.

652
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:39,100
You're the type of girl
you try to get to marry if you can.

653
01:05:39,852 --> 01:05:41,353
Yeah.

654
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:45,440
Yeah, I don't know about all that.

655
01:05:47,151 --> 01:05:48,193
Lorna?

656
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:51,696
How do you know my name?

657
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:57,452
I think I can help you
restore him to his senses.

658
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:08,129
You know her as Maggie.

659
01:06:08,756 --> 01:06:10,507
Her real name is Shelly Whipple.

660
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:16,388
And who are you?
Carol Briggs, with the Justice Department.

661
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:20,767
Maggie's wanted in Sacramento
for armed robbery...

662
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:23,853
...and in Fresno for arson.

663
01:06:27,441 --> 01:06:29,567
That's why she never leaves the basement.

664
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:32,988
Lorna, you are in a unique position here.

665
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:37,575
You can wash your hands of all of this,
which is what most people would do.

666
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:39,869
But I don't think you're like most people.

667
01:06:40,037 --> 01:06:42,414
Why are you coming to me?
I mean, why not Peter?

668
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:44,249
We need a level head.

669
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:47,168
Someone to be our eyes and ears.

670
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:50,088
Look, I'll tell you what I know, okay,
but it's not much.

671
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,507
Lorna, we believe Maggie is arming.

672
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:57,262
Unwitting or not, her subjects
are being fashioned into a militia.

673
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:59,723
I'm not walking back into a snake pit.

674
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:02,684
All you have to do
is help us lure the snake out.

675
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:06,104
I'm sorry. I am done.

676
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:08,898
Have they asked for a kid?

677
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:16,448
Yeah, a little girl.
That's part of their con.

678
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:20,410
Did they say what they wanted her for?

679
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:22,412
Maggie says it's her mother.

680
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,293
That's a good one.

681
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:32,464
Can you keep a secret from Peter?

682
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:35,842
Then I'll tell you
what they really want her for.

683
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:46,644
I figured it out.

684
01:07:49,356 --> 01:07:53,193
Hi. You scared me.
We do it in a public place.

685
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:57,989
Do what?
You bring Maggie the girl.

686
01:07:58,157 --> 01:08:00,658
But you don't bring the girl
to the basement.

687
01:08:00,951 --> 01:08:05,246
You arrange a meeting in a place
where we could set up cameras beforehand.

688
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:10,001
What made you change your mind?

689
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:12,754
You were right.

690
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:16,633
I think we should finish what we started.

691
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:19,803
I mean, we wanted to make a documentary...

692
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:23,098
...and what better climax
than for Maggie to meet her mother?

693
01:08:26,977 --> 01:08:28,478
Come on.

694
01:08:29,146 --> 01:08:30,814
We'll be late.

695
01:09:07,893 --> 01:09:11,104
Are you all right, Lorna?
Yeah.

696
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:13,148
I'm just hungry.

697
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:19,863
My dad used to say that the hardest thing
for humans is transition.

698
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:23,867
We're survivors.

699
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:29,747
We can live in conditions
beyond your wildest imagination.

700
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:35,420
You guys have been fasting for a week.

701
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:41,259
Some of you have cheated.

702
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:46,389
You're only cheating yourselves.

703
01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:52,437
In the future, food is scarce...

704
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:56,316
...and real hunger will be a part of life.

705
01:09:59,403 --> 01:10:01,446
I have food for you.

706
01:10:02,406 --> 01:10:04,282
You don't have to eat it.

707
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:11,247
But trust me that the thought of eating it...

708
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:15,126
...is much scarier than the reality.

709
01:10:18,797 --> 01:10:22,967
The ones who will not only survive
but will thrive...

710
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:26,971
...are the ones who realize
that there's nothing to be afraid of.

711
01:10:34,772 --> 01:10:37,815
O'Shea,
you want something to eat?

712
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,403
It's just new to you.

713
01:10:42,988 --> 01:10:44,781
Food that moves.

714
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:49,327
Lorna?
I'm vegan.

715
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:50,662
Fair enough.

716
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:52,330
Peter?

717
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,687
Mel.

718
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:28,449
Very soon this group
is gonna begin its journey.

719
01:11:31,245 --> 01:11:32,954
I won't be with you.

720
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:37,208
What? Where are you going?
It's just change.

721
01:11:52,599 --> 01:11:55,393
And you guys are gonna be fine.

722
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:02,358
And...

723
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:06,779
...if you allow yourself...

724
01:12:07,364 --> 01:12:10,491
...to get quiet now and again...

725
01:12:11,535 --> 01:12:14,037
...to really be still...

726
01:12:15,205 --> 01:12:18,291
...you will hear the sound of my voice.

727
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:43,191
Next Friday, there's a class field trip.

728
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:45,443
You know Maggie can't leave.

729
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:48,780
The microorganisms of our time
are too intense for her immune system.

730
01:12:49,948 --> 01:12:51,866
She's lived on the outside before.

731
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:54,369
Yes, and it nearly killed her.

732
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:56,454
Well, it's the best I can do.

733
01:12:57,581 --> 01:13:01,000
Bring Maggie to the La Brea Tar Pits
at 1 p. m. next Friday...

734
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:03,252
...I'll bring you Abigail Pritchett.

735
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:58,516
Mrs. Dewitt is unable to make it in today.

736
01:13:58,684 --> 01:14:02,687
So Mr. Aitken will be chaperoning
your trip to the La Brea Tar Pits.

737
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:05,982
I hope to hear good things from him.

738
01:14:08,652 --> 01:14:09,819
Guys.

739
01:14:09,987 --> 01:14:13,406
Okay, everybody chill out. Chill out, guys.

740
01:14:13,574 --> 01:14:14,615
Sandra.

741
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:28,713
When you see Peter leave with Abby, text "hi."

742
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:33,384
You'll receive a "hi" back and Andy
will come and chaperone the class.

743
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:37,680
Then you, you need to follow Peter
at a distance.

744
01:14:37,848 --> 01:14:40,641
When Maggie arrives, text a smiley face.

745
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:45,146
Be sure to keep your phone with you.
That's how we know where you are.

746
01:14:46,064 --> 01:14:49,025
And they know not to harm Peter, right?

747
01:14:49,401 --> 01:14:53,738
No one's gonna harm anyone.
Most likely you won't even see Maggie.

748
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:55,573
We'll be sure to take her on entry.

749
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:57,992
Peter will never know
that you were involved.

750
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,411
Happy endings for all.

751
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:07,084
When we say "prehistoric,"
we mean "pre-writing"...

752
01:15:07,252 --> 01:15:11,088
...a time before man could record
his written experience.

753
01:15:11,256 --> 01:15:16,260
And in 3500 BC,
which was only about 5000 years ago...

754
01:15:16,428 --> 01:15:19,931
...the written language
and thus man's recorded history began.

755
01:15:47,334 --> 01:15:51,671
I wanna go back inside.
Just a second.

756
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:54,590
What am I being punished for?

757
01:15:54,758 --> 01:15:56,509
Nothing.

758
01:15:56,677 --> 01:15:58,928
Nothing, okay? You're not in trouble.

759
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:06,978
Okay. Listen, can you keep a secret?

760
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:10,982
My friend Maggie, she is an actress...

761
01:16:11,149 --> 01:16:13,192
...and she wants to hang out with kids...

762
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:18,030
...because she is going to be
playing a mother, right?

763
01:16:18,198 --> 01:16:23,119
So she just wants somebody
that she can, you know, play pretend with.

764
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:25,162
And I picked you.

765
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:27,164
I hope you don't mind.
Is she on TV?

766
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:32,670
Where's Maggie?
Go out the side entrance with Abby.

767
01:16:32,838 --> 01:16:35,298
You'll receive a call with instructions.
No.

768
01:16:35,465 --> 01:16:37,633
No way. This is not what we agreed to.

769
01:16:37,801 --> 01:16:40,219
Tell Maggie that it has to be here or nothing.

770
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:42,972
I'll chaperone your class.
Take off your shoes.

771
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,599
Lorna's watching the class.
That's not the issue.

772
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:47,977
Take off your shoes.
Don't take those off, Abby.

773
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:50,980
I wanna meet Maggie.
No, you don't.

774
01:16:51,898 --> 01:16:55,610
This is not what we agreed to.
You have half an hour till your bus boards.

775
01:16:56,445 --> 01:17:00,781
Maggie's gonna get what she wants,
with or without you.

776
01:17:14,087 --> 01:17:15,713
Come on.

777
01:17:18,216 --> 01:17:22,887
Why do we take off our shoes?
Shh. We gotta keep quiet now, okay?

778
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:39,111
This is not what we agreed to.

779
01:17:39,404 --> 01:17:41,072
This is not...

780
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:45,534
Yeah. Yeah, I see it. I see the....

781
01:17:53,585 --> 01:17:56,921
Don't be scared.
Why would I be scared?

782
01:18:03,428 --> 01:18:05,054
Don't come any closer.

783
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:14,230
Okay, I'm ready. Just the girl.

784
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:29,662
If I take off my shawl,
will you take off your hat?

785
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:39,148
How do you know my secret handshake?

786
01:19:42,486 --> 01:19:44,361
You taught it to me.

787
01:19:46,698 --> 01:19:48,532
Shelly Whipple, you're under arrest.
What?

788
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:50,701
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can be used...

789
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:53,454
...against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.

790
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:55,372
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided.

791
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:58,459
wait.
She's sick, you bastards!

792
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:01,545
Come on.
Let her go! Let her go!

793
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:05,966
What did you do, Peter?

794
01:20:08,553 --> 01:20:10,387
Traitor.

795
01:20:11,264 --> 01:20:12,723
You traitor.

796
01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:15,434
Let's go call the attorney.

797
01:20:41,419 --> 01:20:42,920
Who is she?

798
01:20:46,258 --> 01:20:47,925
I don't know.

799
01:20:53,098 --> 01:20:54,640
Peter.

800
01:20:56,935 --> 01:20:59,270
It's not my choice.

801
01:21:00,188 --> 01:21:01,939
It's yours.

802
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:07,069
<i>My friend once told me
Something so right</i>

803
01:21:07,237 --> 01:21:12,199
<i>He said to be careful
Of thieves in the night</i>

804
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:21,500
<i>Baby, I've lost you here in the crowd</i>

805
01:21:21,668 --> 01:21:26,964
<i>Open your arms
I want to be found</i>

806
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:35,723
<i>Maybe I'm calling your name in the night</i>

807
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:42,438
<i>Open our eyes
We'll feel with our sight</i>

808
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:04,335
<i>A want is a lack but also desire</i>

809
01:22:04,502 --> 01:22:09,298
<i>A need can be nothing
But should be held higher</i>

810
01:22:15,138 --> 01:22:18,515
<i>A need is a want wearing disguise</i>

811
01:22:18,683 --> 01:22:23,520
<i>It can be confused if fueled by desire</i>

812
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:32,780
<i>Baby, I'm calling your name in the night</i>

813
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:38,577
<i>No reason with need
Look into my eyes</i>

814
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:04,228
<i>Happiness is what we all want</i>

815
01:23:07,065 --> 01:23:12,236
<i>May it be that we don't always want</i>

816
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:19,243
<i>Happiness is what we all want</i>

817
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:27,710
<i>May it be that we don't all want</i>

818
01:23:41,057 --> 01:23:44,393
<i>My friend once told me
Something so right</i>

819
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:49,982
<i>He said to be careful
Of bugs that don't bite</i>

820
01:23:55,405 --> 01:23:58,741
<i>My friend once told me
Something so right</i>

821
01:23:58,908 --> 01:24:04,329
<i>He said to be careful
Of thieves in the night</i>

822
01:24:25,810 --> 01:24:30,481
<i>Happiness is what we all want</i>

823
01:24:32,984 --> 01:24:38,781
<i>May it be that we don't always want</i>

824
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:45,079
<i>Happiness is what we all want</i>
