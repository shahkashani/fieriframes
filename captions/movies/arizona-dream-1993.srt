1
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,500
<i>A howling wind is whistling
in the night...</i>

2
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,200
<i>My dog is growling in the dark...</i>

3
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,800
<i>Something's pulling me outside...</i>

4
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
<i>To ride around in circles...</i>

5
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,300
<i>I know you have
got the time...</i>

6
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,800
<i>Coz anything I want, you do...</i>

7
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,000
<i>You'll take a ride
through the strangers...</i>

8
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,500
<i>Who don't understand
how to feel...</i>

9
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,200
<i>In the deathcar,
we're alive...</i>

10
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,400
<i>In the deathcar...</i>

11
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,200
<i>We're alive...</i>

12
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,900
<i>I'll let some air come
in the window...</i>

13
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,600
<i>Kind of wakes me up a little...</i>

14
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,600
<i>I don't turn on the radio...</i>

15
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,500
<i>- Coz they play shit, like...
- The Bosnians...</i>

16
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,000
<i>You know...</i>

18
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,900
- "Good morning, Columbus."

19
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,300
<i>These were my mother's eternal words, reminding
me America was already discovered...</i>

20
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,300
<i>...and that day-dreaming
was a long way from life's truths.</i>

21
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,600
<i>But what's the point of reading of somebody
telling me the difference between an apple and a bicycle?</i>

22
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,700
<i>If I bite a bicycle and ride an apple,
I'll know the difference.</i>

23
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,200
<i>But thinking about what to do made me
more tired than actually doing.</i>

24
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,300
<i>I remember my father once said that
if you ever wanted to look at someone's soul...</i>

25
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,800
<i>...you have to ask to look at their dreams.</i>

26
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,500
<i>And then you'd have mercy for those
who swim in bigger shit than your own.</i>

27
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,700
<i>My name is Axel Blackmar, and I work
for the Department of Fish and Game.</i>

28
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,000
<i>Most people think I count fish,
but I don't.</i>

29
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,300
<i>I look at 'em.</i>

30
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,500
<i>I look at their souls, their dreams
and then I let them into my dreams.</i>

31
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:46,100
<i>People think the fish are stupid, but I was always sure
that they weren't. Because they know when to be quiet.</i>

32
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,400
<i>And it's people that are stupid. A fish that
know everything don't need to think.</i>

33
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,800
<i>See, fish start out in small streams,
and then I prepare them for the ocean.</i>

34
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,700
<i>When they're ready to die,
they return to where they came from.</i>

35
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,100
<i>That's my connection,
that's why I swam away to the city.</i>

36
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,400
<i>Okay, here's my job:..</i>

37
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,100
<i>All I do
is temporarily electrocute the fish...</i>

38
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:13,400
<i>...then with deep respect, I scoop 'em
and haul 'em in, one by one.</i>

39
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,900
<i>Sometimes I'll look straight into a pair of
fish eyes and I'll see my whole life.</i>

40
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,800
<i>It's something only fish can show us,
and I love 'em for it.</i>

41
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,200
<i>Anyway, I got all the fish, tag and measure 'em
and weigh 'em, just to make sure they're doing okay.</i>

42
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,700
<i>And if they want to talk, I'm always ready
to listen. That's the job of a Fish God.</i>

43
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,400
<i>You know what?
I've never caught a fish in a lie...</i>

44
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,800
<i>...and I've never seen a fish
swim in the shit that human people do.</i>

45
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,000
<i>That's why I love my work,
and I love New York.</i>

46
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,900
<i>Not because my mother said it was one of the eight
points in the world that have real magnetic pull...</i>

47
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,800
<i>...but because you can see everybody,
and nobody can see you.</i>

48
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,100
<i>Hey, honey! How are you?
How was Istanbul?</i>

49
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,200
<i>I'm looking... yes, I'm looking for my girlfriend,
Suzanne Supak. I just spoke with her. Over.</i>

50
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,100
<i>I love you too, honey.</i>

51
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,300
<i>I... I... I'm sure... I... I...</i>

52
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,400
I miss you... I miss you, too, honey. Over.
Two more, please!

53
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,500
<i>Pregnant? Wow! Over.</i>

54
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,800
<i>Listen, honey...</i>

55
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,700
Alright, let's go.

56
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,400
- I'm not going.
- Come on! Alright? We're running late!

57
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,500
I said I'm not going.

58
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,400
- You said you're not going?
- I said I'm not going.

59
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,200
You're not going?

60
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,700
- I'm not going.
- You're not going?

61
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,200
Are you gonna go?
Are you gonna go?

62
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,800
Are you gonna go or no?

63
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,600
- Are you gonna shoot me? Going to kill me?
- Am I gonna shoot...

64
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,600
Th... These things. I don't even...
It's a blank. It's a blank.

65
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,300
But I had you scared, right?
Are you scared?

66
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,500
Let me feel.
You shit your pants.

67
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:13,000
"Will you take care of me..?
Take care of me..." I'm fuckin' sick of it!

68
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,100
- What?
- What?

69
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,800
He's your uncle, for Chrissakes.

70
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,800
Paul, if he wants to see me, why isn't he here?
Why did he send you? Why didn't he come?

71
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,700
You know it wasn't his fault, right?

72
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,800
I don't blame him for anything, Paul.
I didn't... I never said that it was his fault.

73
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,600
Well, he's getting married,
and he'd invite you as his best man.

74
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,800
- You be his best man.
- Why are you like that? You're killing him! Why?

75
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,200
Alright, Axel! Axel! Axel, listen.

76
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,200
<i>- End of story! Over!
- Axel!</i>

77
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,300
<i>Axel!</i>

78
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,300
I love you too!

79
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:00,000
<i>I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna
tell him that I couldn't find you.</i>

80
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,100
- Really?
- Really. I have no choice.

81
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,300
- Promise?
- I promise. What about a hug? No hug for me?

82
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,900
Axel! Axel, you smell like a scumbag!

83
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,900
What's... What's going on?

84
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,200
But I'm a happy scumbag.
I got a nice truck and a great job.

85
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,300
- But you smell.
- What're you gonna have?

86
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,700
- Let's have two beers. Two beers.
- Two beers. OK.

87
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,900
- And a ginger ale.
- Two beers and...

88
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,500
- Forget the ginger ale. Bring two beers and two shots.
- Blanche?

89
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,700
- Bring two... two shots and two beers.
- Who's the boss?

90
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,800
- I am the boss.
- He is the boss. He is the boss.

91
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,600
- Two beers and two shots.
- A ginger ale, please.

92
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,600
Two beers, two shots.

93
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,800
- And a ginger ale.
- Don't confuse her. Don't confuse her.

94
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
Please, can I have a ginger ale?

95
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,000
Anyway, Axel, I love you, but...

96
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,300
- What? I love you too, but...
- Okay, well, you know... ginger ale.

97
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,700
<i>- That's right. Two beers and two shots.
- Ginger ale.</i>

98
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,400
Two beers and two shots.

99
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,100
- "Two beers and two shots." What's that?
- What?

100
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,300
That thing...

101
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,800
- What thing?
- I dunno. Like a funny accent or something?

102
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,700
- What funny accent thing?
- "Two beers and two shots."

103
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,000
What is that?

104
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,400
I dunno... like New York?

105
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,700
Funny New York accent, huh?

106
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:14,800
Yeah? Is De Niro funny? Is Pacino funny?
Is Rocky funny? Was Rocky funny?

107
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,800
- The great actors are all from New York.
- Sinatra?

108
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,500
Sinatra's from Hoboken, New Jersey.
Now let's toast.

109
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,900
- Alright? It's been three years, OK?
- Three years.

110
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,500
To three years. Three years.

111
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,400
<i>- Three years.
- Three years.</i>

112
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,400
<i>- Blanche.
- Blanche.</i>

113
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,500
Ginger ale.

114
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,300
- Ginger ale...
- Ginger ale...

115
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,700
...two shots.

116
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,500
Three years. We don't see each other
three years and you want ginger ale.

117
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,200
- Thank you, Blanche. Thank you, Blanche.
- Thank you for the ginger ale.

118
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,000
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, boys.

119
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,000
Gimme a hug.
I'll plug my nose.

120
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,100
<i>Ok! Ok, back to the dream.</i>

121
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,200
The man gives the stomach balloon
to the little boy.

122
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,000
<i>Pushes him out of the igloo.</i>

123
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,600
While the kid is outside,
the two inside the igloo start, y'know...

124
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:24,300
Yelling... Stop yelling, we're on Broadway.
Show respect to the... to the artists here.

125
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:28,100
Therefore, I know you're all
dying for a piece of wedding cake...

126
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,100
So I will make this short and sweet.

127
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,700
Millie...

128
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,600
...dear friends...

129
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,700
...waiters and waitresses, I'd like to
propose this wedding toast...

130
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,700
<i>- Leo?
- Not now, Millie.</i>

131
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,800
Come on!

132
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,000
- Hey!
- Don't fuck around!

133
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,100
Hey! Don't fuck around!
Cut it out!

134
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,400
Cut it out! Cut it out!
Don't be a jerk! Cut it out!

135
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,900
Cut it out!

136
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,700
<i>I got an audition coming up! You're lucky
I don't come down, I'd kick your ass...</i>

137
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,800
Cut it out!

138
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,600
Axel! Cut it out!

139
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,300
<i>- Axel! You want me to come down?
- Ok! Come on down!</i>

140
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,200
<i>Come on...</i>

141
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,700
<i>- Stop shaking the ladder!
- Axel!</i>

142
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,500
<i>- Do you want me to come down?
- Leo!</i>

143
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,800
<i>- My boy!
- Cut it out! Axel!</i>

144
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,800
I can't believe this!

145
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,100
- Leo! Leo!
- Axel! Axel!

146
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,600
You got big on me!

147
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,000
- I guess you heard about the wedding?
- I did. Oh, congratulations, Leo.

148
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,200
Thank you! I'd be especially proud
if you'd be my best man.

149
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,700
I wish I could, I've... I've gotta
get back to New York tonight.

150
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,700
Sure... Larry, we have to make Axel
an appointment tomorrow for a fitting.

151
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,300
Honestly, Leo, I've got to go.

152
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,800
- Yeah, I know! It's so good to see you, Axel.
- You, too.

153
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,000
You look terrific.

154
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,800
I... I... I just wanna show you something.
I... I wanna share this with you.

155
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,500
What do you think about my Saguro?

156
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,100
- The cactus?
- Nice, huh?

157
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,000
Let me let you in on a secret:..

158
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,700
You see, when a cactus is that young,
it is exceptionally vulnerable.

159
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,800
That's why I planted that Mesquite tree
right next to it, for protection.

160
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,000
You see, if you don't see an older tree
nearby a new cactus, you can forget it.

161
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,800
It ain't gonna make it.

162
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,800
Enough for that. Come on inside.
Somebody's dyin' in to meet you.

163
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,900
Millie! Millie, I'd like you to meet
my nephew Axel.

164
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,500
Axel, this is Millie.

165
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,800
Millie, Axel.
Axel, Millie.

166
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,100
How do you do?

167
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,200
- Aren't you overdoing it just a little, Millie?
- Oh, sorry.

168
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,800
Come on, sit down here,
next to me, Axel.

169
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,200
Well, let... lemme get
a pair of pants on first...

170
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,800
- Stop singing!
- I'm not singing. Well, I never... I count!

171
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,100
Oh, you've got to count
the stitches in the jacket?

172
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,700
<i>- You've been on it for a week already. Get it finished!
- Goodbye, anybody!</i>

173
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,500
Bye bye anybody...

174
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,900
Excuse me for interrupting
you two, but I had to get my pants on.

175
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,500
Yeah!

176
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,700
Well, Leo's told me so much about you.

177
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,700
Yeah!

178
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,200
So, I'm... I guess you know
I'm gonna be your new aunt.

179
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,200
You're his... fianc�e.

180
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,000
Yeah.

181
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,300
Yeah.

182
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,100
<i>Well...</i>

183
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,800
...you don't have to call me Aunt Millie,
though. I mean, unless you want to.

184
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,600
<i>Yeah.</i>

185
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,800
- How old are you?
- Twenty three.

186
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,100
Oh!

187
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,500
We're almost the same age...

188
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,700
Isn't that funny?

189
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,900
Millie, please.
Remember we talked about this?

190
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,000
I'm sorry, Leo. Just a second.

191
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,900
Leo's trying to teach me
how to stop crying.

192
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:31,500
Sweetheart, why don't you go in the other room
and try on the other wedding dress for Axel?

193
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,900
Let him see that.

194
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,800
And then...

195
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,000
I mean that'll get your mind off.

196
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:44,300
Go in the other room, sweetheart,
and try the other dress on...

197
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,900
...it'll take your mind off crying.
It's in the other room!

198
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,400
- I'm going.
- Do me the favor.

199
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,800
Axel, Axel, Axel!

200
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
Leo, Leo, Leo!

201
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,600
You know, Axel, that's my little Polish
cupcake and she's very sensitive...

202
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,100
<i>...like the Eastern European people are.</i>

203
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,400
<i>- But she's very nice, right?
- Very nice, Leo.</i>

204
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,300
- And you know how old she is?
- Yeah. She's young.

205
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,900
You're damn right
and that's success.

206
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,600
And in order to achieve that success,
you need to sell cars.

207
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,400
I don't wanna sell cars.

208
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:42,700
Axel, do you revise my father had the first
Cadillac dealership in Arizona in 1914!

209
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,800
And he had this magnificent dream,
to sell as many cars as he possibly could...

210
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,500
...and stack them one on top of the other until
they got high enough so that he could walk up to the moon.

211
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,400
Isn't it beautiful?

212
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,400
It's very beautiful, Leo, but the cars would
topple over before you could stack 'em that high.

213
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,400
Yeah, that's what I told him,
but he wanted me in the business...

214
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,400
...and I resisted him,
like you're resisting me.

215
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,600
I'm not resisting, Leo.
I just... I don't wanna sell cars.

216
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,000
- What the hell are you afraid of?
- I'm not afraid of anything.

217
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,200
<i>One thing I was sure of...</i>

218
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,700
<i>...my uncle Leo was definitely
the hero of my childhood.</i>

219
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,500
<i>The smell of his "Old Spice" cologne carried me back
into that lost childhood more than the home movies did.</i>

220
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,500
<i>My uncle didn't know it...</i>

221
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,000
<i>...but it was the sweet, cheap smell
of car dealers that took me back...</i>

222
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,900
<i>...and made me dissolve
into a dream of the past.</i>

223
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,200
<i>Leo was the last dinosaur
that smelled of cheap cologne.</i>

224
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,700
<i>And he believed in
the American dream.</i>

225
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,800
<i>I was crazy about him,
because he believed in miracles.</i>

226
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,500
<i>And even though he lived inside
of life and sold Cadillacs...</i>

227
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,400
<i>...he always looked like a 10-year-old
boy whose sleeves were too long.</i>

228
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,900
<i>When I was 10,
Leo gave me this great movie camera.</i>

229
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,800
<i>My mother always hoped
I'd become the next Milton Berle.</i>

230
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,700
<i>But dreams about houses and cars and fresh-cut
lawns aren't dreams when they become real.</i>

231
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,700
<i>And so now, I understood what my mother
meant by "Good morning, Columbus."</i>

232
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,000
<i>And even if my mother didn't like
what I was doing with my life...</i>

233
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,300
<i>...I think she'd understand me.</i>

234
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:10,000
<i>When I was 11, I got this really weird
earache that wouldn't go away.</i>

235
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,200
<i>I went to about a hundred doctors,
but none of them could help me.</i>

236
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,100
<i>So what Leo did was,
he went into Mexico...</i>

237
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:20,800
<i>...and brought back this fat lady witch doctor who
did some mumbo jumbo and fixed me right up.</i>

238
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,000
<i>I was grateful, but somehow I thought
I might've been better off mute.</i>

239
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,300
<i>All in all,
I had a very happy childhood.</i>

240
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,700
<i>My father was a border guard, he spent most of
his life trying to keep people from crossing lines.</i>

241
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,400
<i>Every night for 15 years, he'd go out and smooth
down the road between Mexico and Arizona...</i>

242
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,500
<i>...and every morning he'd be out there
looking for footprints in the dirt.</i>

243
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,300
<i>But my father always said that work
was like a hat you put on your head.</i>

244
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,800
<i>And even if you didn't have pants, you didn't have
to walk down the street ashamed of your ass.</i>

245
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,300
<i>'Cause you had a hat.</i>

246
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,300
<i>One of the other things
I was sure about my life was:..</i>

247
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,600
<i>...The moment my parents died,
my childhood was gone forever.</i>

248
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,600
<i>Leo could never shake the guilt
of my parents' death 6 years ago.</i>

249
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,300
<i>Leo was driving the car that night.</i>

250
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,500
<i>It got so bad that he even felt guilty
if he used too much shaving cream.</i>

251
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,900
<i>Four days after the funeral,
I caught a train to New York City.</i>

252
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:22,800
<i>And if somebody was to ask me why I don't get up
right now and catch the next train back to New York...</i>

253
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,900
<i>...it's because you can't say no
to your childhood hero.</i>

254
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,300
<i>I decided to be his best man,
one thing I was sure of:..</i>

255
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,200
<i>No matter how much I loved
the smell of cheap cologne...</i>

256
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:37,300
<i>...I was never gonna become my uncle,
I was never gonna sell Cadillacs.</i>

257
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,400
Axel...

258
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,100
...if I died tomorrow,
where would you be?

259
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,700
You're not gonna die tomorrow, Leo.

260
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,900
Who knows when I'll die?

261
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,800
Your mother and father didn't know
when they were gonna die.

262
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,200
That was an accident.

263
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,300
No, it was stupidity. I shouldn't
have been behind that wheel.

264
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,700
Please, no guilt. Please.

265
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,200
Please.

266
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,100
Look...

267
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,600
...I'm not going to allow you to become
a bum on the streets of New York.

268
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:33,400
I want you to stay here with me.
Please. Try it for one week.

269
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,900
If you don't like it,
then you go home.

270
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,300
Okay?

271
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,100
Okay.

272
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:58,000
- Axel, make "busy". Very, very busy.
- Hello.

273
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,200
Busy, but "willing to take time out
from your schedule", Axel.

274
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,600
Hello.

275
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,000
Axel, make "sexy."

276
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,200
Hello.

277
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,000
Try it with your lips,
pucker them up... "Hello".

278
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,000
Hello.

279
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,400
<i>- Hello.
- Hello.</i>

280
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:31,700
- No, more with the lips, you know, "Hello."
- Axel!

281
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,700
I'm a gorgeous woman,
and I have big, beautiful breasts.

282
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,900
Now do "sexy."

283
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Hello.

284
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,100
- No, Axel. Breasts. Breasts.
- Hello.

285
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,400
<i>You're talking art,
you're talking gravity. Huh?</i>

286
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,000
<i>Look! I'm...</i>

287
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,300
- You see this?
- Yeah.

288
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,400
- Banana.
- Proteins, proteins...

289
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,100
Your organs produce a certain
amount of proteins, right?

290
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,800
Well, when you see a beautiful woman,
you produce extra proteins.

291
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,600
These extra proteins
go directly to your brain.

292
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,300
- Where do you get all this stuff?
- It's a scienti... scientific fact.

293
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,100
Anyway, I've figured out a way
how to make it work for me.

294
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,000
I call it "The Gaze."

295
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,100
You look into a woman's eyes,
and you think...

296
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,100
...exactly what you want her
to do for you.

297
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:31,000
You're an actor?
Oh my God, he's an actor!

298
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,700
In 12 days, I have a gigantic
performance I'm doing in Tucson.

299
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,800
Maybe the three of you
would like to come and see me?

300
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,600
Wow! Yeah!

301
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,100
- It's an audition.
- She'll like that!

302
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,900
What have we seen you in?
Like what kind of movies, TV shows?

303
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,500
- Do you go to foreign films?
- No.

304
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,600
Well, I'm a major star in Europe.

305
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,800
Foreign films?

306
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,000
Yeah, foreign films.

307
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,900
Come here, close to me.

308
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,100
Feel better now?

309
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,900
You feel better now?

310
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,700
You like that?
No, don't touch my face, okay?

311
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,200
- Oh, come on!
- No, no, come on now, I'm not kidding.

312
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,900
We can make love,
but do not touch my face or my hair.

313
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,200
- Are all actors like that?
- All the great actors are like that.

314
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,700
- Do you think anybody touches Brando's face?
- No!

315
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,000
- Do you think they touch Pacino's face?
- No!

316
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:48,000
Do you think they touch De Niro's face?
Or can anybody fucking touch this Johnny Depp's face?

317
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:52,300
Then no one's gonna touch
Paul Leger's face, okay?

318
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,900
I'm missing my favorite scene here...

319
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,400
<i>I'm telling you, if I hear anything,
I swear I'm gonna kill somebody...</i>

320
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,400
<i>Go ahead and kill everybody!
You're the tough guy, go kill the people!</i>

321
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,200
Kill Vicky, kill Salvy...

322
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,700
<i>...go kill Tommy Como,
and kill me while you're at it!</i>

323
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,900
<i>You're killing yourself, the way you eat,
you fat fuck! Look at you!</i>

324
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,400
What do you mean? I don't see!
What do you mean "kill you"?

325
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,300
Me, kill me!

326
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:26,500
<i>- Start here! Kill me first! Do me a fuckin' favor!
- You meant something.</i>

327
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:31,100
You mentioned Tommy, mentioned Salvy,
mentioned you, included you with them.

328
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,400
You could have said anybody,
but you said you and them.

329
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,500
You would have let this girl ruin your life,
wouldn't you?

330
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,900
<i>She really did some job on you!
You know fucking that you are.</i>

331
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,500
- Look what she did to you!
- You fucked my wife.

332
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,800
- What?
- You fucked my wife?

333
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,700
I'm not going to answer.
It's a sick question.

334
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,700
<i>I'm gonna leave.</i>

335
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,400
Very nice!

336
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,600
You won't have troubles upstairs in your bedroom,
if you don't pick it out on me or anybody else!

337
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,400
Pig, pig, pig! Here!

338
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,200
Hello!

339
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,700
Hello!

340
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,500
So pig, pig, pig, pig, pig!
Pig, pig, here!

341
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,700
<i>Hello. Hello there.</i>

342
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,200
<i>Adrian Del Monica.
How are you doing?</i>

343
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,500
- I'm not seein' it.
- It's right in front of you!

344
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:12,500
Yeah, but the... the vibe...
Ow! It's all wrong.

345
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:23,400
<i>Mine is a 1966, and it's old!
My car is old and I need one!</i>

346
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,200
I'm not giving you more than
500 dollars. Mother, that's it.

347
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,500
You hear me?
Are you listening to me?

348
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,500
Yep, Mother... You know,
don't even think about this, Mother!

349
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,900
I can look if I want to.

350
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,800
Don't you know... Put the window down!
Get out! You cannot pay for this. Get out!

351
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,400
- Yes, I can!
- No, you can't, Mother!

352
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,500
- Yes, I can!
- Mother! You hear me!

353
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,400
We made a deal this morning 500 dollars.
That's all I'm gonna give you.

354
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,400
I don't know, well, you know...

355
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,700
- Well, how are you going to pay for this?
- I'm gonna pay with your money.

356
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,600
- With your money...
- With my money?

357
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,600
- Which is half mine. Half mine.
- You know what, Mother? Mother...

358
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,100
- Fuck you, Mother!
- Hello, I'm Axel Blackmar.

359
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,300
Fuck you, too!

360
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,300
What a beautiful dress that is.

361
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:00,100
Oh, please don't bullshit, because I didn't come
here to get cheap compliments from a salesman.

362
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:05,100
I wasn't complimenting you. I'm sorry. Listen.
If I've offended you anyway, please forgive me.

363
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,400
I'm sorry.

364
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,100
- Ok, you break, you pay!
- No.

365
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,600
- Break, you pay.
- No.

366
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,200
Something wrong with it?

367
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,200
- Yeah, it's funny.
- Thank you so much. That's very nice.

368
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:23,700
Okay, right.
The undercoating looks pretty good.

369
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,700
I dont know, but...
the suspension is funny. Look.

370
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,800
- Really?
- Yeah, look, you see the right wheel?

371
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,900
- It's lower than the left.
- It is.

372
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Yeah, that's true.

373
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,200
Listen! I didn't mean to insult.

374
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,100
Believe me. I just... I just wanted
to tell you how beautiful you look.

375
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,700
- Listen! Are you going to sell me a car or not?
- Yes.

376
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,000
- Hello, Elaine.
- Hi!

377
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,900
- How are you?
- I didn't know you worked here.

378
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,400
Yes, I do. Temporarily.

379
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,300
Can you hold on a sec? I'll be right
with you. Axel, can I talk to you?

380
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,500
- Will you keep the daughter busy for me?
- No. Oh... she's my first customer.

381
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,900
The woman knows my face.
It's better for the sale, Axel.

382
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,000
- Woah, woah! It's better for the sale, if I do it! Because I asked...
- Hey, you're touching my suit, don't ever do that.

383
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,700
Please do me a favor,
keep the daughter busy.

384
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,900
- Elaine, do you want to step outside?
- Sure.

385
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,700
- Why's he looking at me like that?
- Oh, he's a kid. He's...

386
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,300
Do you ever think about suicide?

387
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,100
- Excuse me?
- Suicide.

388
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,400
- Not recently.
- No?

389
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,800
I think about it all the time.
I wanna come back as a turtle.

390
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,300
- Turtles are very nice.
- Yes, they're the best.

391
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:47,900
She's not my real mother. Did you know that?
She married my father. He's dead.

392
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,900
Both my parents are dead.

393
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,400
Boy! Do you become your parents,
like it or not.

394
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,200
Even if they're not your real parents.
I'm gonna kill myself before that happens.

395
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,100
- Really?
- Yeah.

396
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,000
Do you think maybe
you're overreacting?

397
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,500
- No?
- No.

398
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,700
It's an evil fucking match.

399
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,400
Look at my hands! Look at my hands!
These aren't my hands.

400
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,500
These are her hands.

401
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,700
Do you like my legs?
I hate them!

402
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,200
Sometimes I'll be sitting some place,
I'll look down...

403
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,200
...and my legs will be crossed
exactly like hers.

404
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,200
- Well! She does have nice legs.
- Yes, she does.

405
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,100
What's so bad
about becoming your mother?

406
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:37,700
Just wait. One morning you'll wake up,
and you'll be your father. Just wait.

407
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
- Wrong. My uncle is my only family.
- What does he do?

408
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,800
- He owns this place.
- See what I mean?

409
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,500
My father owned the 3rd largest
copper mine in Arizona.

410
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:53,800
Guess what? Now I own the 3rd largest
copper mine in Arizona.

411
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,600
You're an idiot if you think
you can escape it.

412
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,200
Don't call me an idiot.

413
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,400
Look, man...

414
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,800
<i>...I gave you pazzazz...</i>

415
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,200
...I offered you excitement,
vibes...

416
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,700
...sexy good-looking...

417
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:18,400
I even gave you waaaaaagaaanganngg!
What else could you possibly want in a car?

418
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,600
Good gas mileage. That's important.

419
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,500
Look, Mr. Del Monico, look at my lips,
look at them carefully.

420
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,600
Watch what they're gonna say to you.
They're gonna say:..

421
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:33,400
Take your whsshht and get off my lot,
before I punch you right in your didly squat!

422
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,500
Now git!

423
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,100
- Are you sore about something?
- Out!

424
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,700
Out!

425
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,100
Buy a Ford!

426
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,200
It's disgusting.
Isn't it disgusting?

427
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,100
- Goodbye, chickenhead.
- Axel.

428
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:58,300
- Hey Elaine, so I... you know, I was wondering...
- I mean you know we just met everything...

429
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,400
...I was wondering maybe the two of us could get
together some time, have a little picnic or a soir�e as sort?

430
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,900
I don't think so.
Goodbye, Paul.

431
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,900
- What the fuck was that?
- What?

432
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,600
I was waiting for that woman.
I told you I was waiting for that woman.

433
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,300
- Hey, come on!
- Why was the door locked?

434
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,300
- Why was the door locked in your office?
- She was making a phone call. A phone call.

435
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,500
- Oh, really?
- Yes, really.

436
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,800
Ok, gentlemen, new showroom policy:
As of today...

437
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,800
...if there's any customers
to come in here that are dressed casually...

438
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,500
...they're yours. As of today, starting now.
Clear the area.

439
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,700
Did you know
that the warriors in Papua New Guinea...

440
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,600
...afford eating turtle meat before battle?

441
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,300
They believe
that turtles are very shy...

442
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,200
...and if they eat the meat...

443
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,700
...their enemies will become shy,
and run away.

444
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,800
- Did you know that?
- Isn't that fascinating?

445
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,400
- Isn't that fascinating?
- Well, it's disgusting, but...

446
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,300
- A Papa New Guinea story!
- It's "Papua New Guinea".

447
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,300
I don't give a shit!
I don't give a shit!

448
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:17,300
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Isn't that... isn't that the place
where the young boys from the village go into the woods...

449
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,100
...and they build a giant lean-to...

450
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,000
- Yes!
- Right! It's kind of shack.

451
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,800
- No! That's right!
- And they... Right...

452
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,300
- That's true.
- Right... right...

453
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,700
Then they bring out some beautiful woman
that they've captured in another village...

454
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,000
- A girl from another village...
- ...and they put her inside the lean-to.

455
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,100
...and put her into lean-to and then every boy in the village
one by one goes into the lean-to to lose his virginity.

456
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:42,700
Given the last boy in line is inside, the rest...
suddenly... go to in the shack and knock...

457
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,900
- Do you know the rest of it?
- Yes.

458
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,000
- Why do they knock it down?
- You do.

459
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,700
They knock it down, because then they
clear the way along as they go inside...

460
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,500
...to find the poor bastard who was
last one inside and eat him, and the girl.

461
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,700
- Nice.
- But they're natives. They're natives.

462
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,200
Oops! I've lost my napkin!

463
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:42,900
<i>Everyday...
Everyday you come home...</i>

464
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:49,500
<i>Everyday you come home...</i>

465
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,600
There's plenty of room here at this table.
Why don't you move your chairs apart?

466
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,800
No, thank you.
We're fine.

467
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,700
Grace! Grace!

468
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,200
Axel, why dont you tell them tell them
the Eskimo movie dream thing?

469
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,500
Why don't you, Paul?

470
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,100
Well, I'd love to hear it!
What is it?

471
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,500
Oh, yes!
My mother loves bedtime stories.

472
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,600
- Go on... go on, Axel.
- Well, this...

473
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:17,100
- This Eskimo, Dooey, is... is fishing through a...
- Grace!

474
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:21,000
...hole in the ice,
and he catches this fish.

475
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,300
- With both eyes on the same side of its head.
- I'm sorry.

476
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
- But is that a real fish?
- Yes, it's a real fish.

477
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,400
But then it's... it's a storm coming...
and... eh...

478
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:38,000
...so Dooey has to get on this dogsled,
and travels through the ice for the... eh...

479
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,400
Stop! Really, stop!

480
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,800
- Grow up! Yeah, Mother, grow up!
- And then they feel cold on the ice and then...

481
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,300
- Mind your own business!
- ...he gets down and builds a fire...

482
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,800
...and the snow from the tree falls down,
puts the...

483
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,700
- ...puts the fire out.
- Jesus.

484
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,000
Hi, sweetheart, go play.

485
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,800
- Is that it? What else happens?
- No. So now Dooey is dying...

486
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,100
- Grace!
- And... um...

487
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,800
...and his dog hypnotizes him...

488
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,600
...and... and brings him back to the igloo...

489
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,900
...where his wife rubs his...
his body with a sponge...

490
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,600
...and... um... you know...
brings him back to life.

491
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,900
That's beautiful.

492
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,100
It is beautiful.

493
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,700
- What was that?
- I'm... I'm sorry, my... my hand slipped. I'm sorry.

494
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,400
Kid, you know.

495
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,500
He's a kid. Beautiful.

496
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:51,300
It must give you great pleasure
to be the life of the party, Mother.

497
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,700
What party is that, Grace?

498
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:57,400
Why must you try to screw
every man you see under 30? Why?

499
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,700
Did you know, Grace, that...

500
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,000
...in Papua New Guinea, it's
considered a right of passage...

501
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,700
I don't wanna hear it! I don't wanna
hear it! I don't wanna hear it!

502
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,300
All I'm saying is that in Papua
New Guinea, if a woman wants to...

503
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,200
- I don't want to hear it! You stop with this, please.
- ...go to bed with a young man...

504
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,200
If she's older, it's okay!

505
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,900
- In Papua New Guinea!
- Okay!

506
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,700
If you fucking say it one more time,
I'm going to smash this table right now!

507
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,200
Papua New Guinea!

508
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,300
- You fucking thing!
- Go!

509
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,400
Fifth!

510
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,700
Paul, maybe we should go...

511
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,200
- You sit down!
- Go!

512
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,400
- You sit.
- Go!

513
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,300
- Sit!
- Go!

514
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,200
- Sit!
- No! You're not invited! Go!

515
00:42:59,300 --> 00:42:59,800
- Sit!
- Go!

516
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:00,900
- Sit!
- Go!

517
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,000
- I think we should stay here tonight.
- No! You're not invited!

518
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,200
- Well, I am.
- Elaine, listen...

519
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,700
No, no! Don't talk to my friends like that.
They can stay if they want.

520
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,000
You are disgusting, you know that?
Do you know what you are? You are...

521
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,100
...you are a little immature girl in sagging,
old body!

522
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,300
But you're just a pale imitation
of me when I was your age.

523
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,300
Maybe so. Except I didn't kill my husband!

524
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,600
- Shut up!
- No, you go ahead!

525
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,800
You tell your fucking new friends...

526
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,100
- ...what it's like to murder somebody!
- Shut up!

527
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,000
- No, you go ahead!
- Shut up, Grace!

528
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,800
- You go ahead!
- Shut, up, Grace!

529
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,600
You're disgusting, you know that?

530
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,600
- Shut up!
- No, 'cuz I said it!

531
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,000
You know what? If it hadn't
been for you, he'd still be alive!

532
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,400
Fuck.

533
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,600
That's it. That's it. I am gonna kill...
I am gonna kill myself right now.

534
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,400
Oh! Okay, good.

535
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,200
Go ahead!

536
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,400
Go ahead!
I'll give you a nice funeral.

537
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,200
I'm sure you will, Mom. Guess what, though!
You're not getting any money!

538
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,800
You're not getting any of my money!

539
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,900
Wouldn't I like you? What else is new?
I don't care it anyway.

540
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,300
Look, Mom! See?

541
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,400
She's taking down her panty hose.

542
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,100
I'm so glad I'll be dead
before your stupid birthday!

543
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,900
You know what, it'd be the best present
you ever gave me!

544
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,500
This is it, Mom! Goodbye, Mom!

545
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:21,900
Grace!

546
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:29,900
Get fucking away!

547
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,300
Look, Mom!

548
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,600
She's got her panties around her neck!

549
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,900
Look at me!

550
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,600
- Mom! Look at me!
- I am eating! I'm eating now!

551
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,300
You are desperate...
and you're sick, Mom.

552
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:48,100
You're sick. I can't live this way, Mom.
I don't want to live this way, Mom.

553
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,200
- Why don't you have some dignity for a change?
- I'm not living this way.

554
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,200
- What do you want me to do? What do you want me to do?
- No, this is good.

555
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,900
What did you do that for?
I didn't bite him!

556
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,700
- Mom!
- You didn't have to hit me, did you?

557
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,500
- Mom!
- Is my nose bleeding?

558
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,200
- Mom!
- Grace, please don't do that!

559
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,600
Why aren't you looking, Mom?
Why aren't you looking at me?

560
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,200
I'm a failure!

561
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:16,900
- I won't live this way anymore.
- I've been incorrigible.

562
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,300
Everybody here witnessed, Mother,
you made me do this.

563
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,100
Grace, stop this right now!
You hear me?

564
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:22,900
- Go fuck yourself!
- Paul! Shut up!

565
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,300
...cowardly lion.

566
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,400
Grace, I'll never say it again.

567
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,500
- Liar!
- No! No, I promise!

568
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,000
- What you promise?
- Never to say "Papua..."

569
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,700
That's... You are so evil, Mother!

570
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,400
Grace!

571
00:45:58,700 --> 00:45:59,600
Grace!

572
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,100
It's okay...

573
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,500
I'll fight you standing on one foot...

574
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,700
I'll fight you with my eyes closed!

575
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,600
Elaine!

576
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:19,200
Did you ever... You know when you're
just about to go to sleep...

577
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,600
...or you're just sort of,
you know, falling asleep...

578
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,400
...and... and you think you're falling really,
then you catch yourself?

579
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,700
- Yeah!
- That ever happen to you?

580
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,000
And you're not falling, you...
you're just falling asleep.

581
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,200
There you go.

582
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:39,100
When I was a little girl...

583
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,500
...I always wanted to fly.

584
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,300
From the top of the house.

585
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,400
At night, I'd close my eyes...

586
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,000
...and imagine I was on the roof...

587
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,700
...looking down at my parents
in their bed.

588
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,900
Then I'd jump off the roof...

589
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,100
...and I'd fly.

590
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,200
While everyone in the neighbourhood
was sleeping...

591
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:12,300
...I'd be soaring around...

592
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,700
...looking through their windows...

593
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,800
...flying...

594
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:28,100
...and resting in the trees.

595
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,200
I always knew I could...

596
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,900
...I never told them.

597
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:43,300
Once someone knows, they can make you fall.
They can make you fall. They can...

598
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,000
...make you...

599
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,800
They can...

600
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,300
After I'm big,
I may start acting weird.

601
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,700
I may even stop returning phone calls,
dressing in all black...

602
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,200
...fancy restaurants, the whole shtick.

603
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:04,200
I want you to keep me in perspective.
Do that for me.

604
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:08,200
- Paul, you already wear all black.
- Listen! You know what I mean.

605
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,400
I just can't become a slave to my...
to my career, to my success.

606
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:16,300
- I have to stay myself.
- I think she likes me.

607
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,300
- I mean, did you see how she looked in my eyes?
- The great Paul Leger!

608
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,900
<i>I started thinking
about Paul's garbage theory...</i>

609
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:27,200
<i>...about the male organs producing the certain amount
of proteins when a beautiful woman looks at you.</i>

610
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:29,700
<i>And if she keeps on looking...</i>

611
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,200
<i>...your organs producing extra protein,
so deadly...</i>

612
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,900
<i>...that if you put one drop
on the tip of an arrow...</i>

613
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,500
<i>...it could kill
a fucking rhinoceros in 2 seconds.</i>

614
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:43,700
<i>I started to think
what I wanted her to think...</i>

615
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,400
<i>...I looked in her eyes...</i>

616
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:48,700
<i>...and bingo!</i>

617
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,200
<i>She was mine.</i>

618
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,900
<i>Paul swears that cavemen used this
deadly technique since time began...</i>

619
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,300
<i>...and that it was the deadly male protein
that killed the dinosaurs, not the ice age.</i>

620
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,000
<i>I think Paul saw it in a movie once,
and convinced himself it was true.</i>

621
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,800
<i>That's how Paul escaped
whenever there was danger.</i>

622
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,400
<i>And that's just what he did
the next day.</i>

623
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,500
<i>I never really paid much attention
to Paul's garbage theories.</i>

624
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,700
<i>But after a while,
I realized he was right.</i>

625
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,500
<i>I felt the proteins running through my body
like broken glass, I didn't know what to do.</i>

626
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,800
<i>I thought I was gonna go blind, so I tried to keep all
these proteins busy by making a flying machine.</i>

627
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:33,100
<i>I've never built a flying machine
before, but how hard it could be?</i>

628
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,600
<i>The proteins were making things fly in my
head, so I was kind of off to a good start.</i>

629
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,800
<i>And the more I worked on it,
the more I was sure it would fly.</i>

630
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:45,200
<i>I just kept telling myself over
and over again: It's gonna fly.</i>

631
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,300
<i>I never thought it could happen
that love hit me like an elephant...</i>

632
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,200
<i>...and I was thrown
into a jungle of dreams.</i>

633
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:56,900
<i>My mother was all wrong
about magnetic pulls in the world.</i>

634
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:00,300
<i>There was only one pull,
and she was lying on my back.</i>

635
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:05,200
<i>It was wrong to say I was "falling in
love," because I never felt any weight...</i>

636
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:09,500
<i>...because I was really "flying in love,"
for the first time in my life.</i>

637
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,000
- Hi, Axel.
- Hi, Grace.

638
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,100
It's beautiful morning out,
isn't it?

639
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,700
- Yes, it is.
- Yeah.

640
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,200
Hey! Go on, sit down.
I'll do this.

641
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,500
- Cereal?
- Huh?

642
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:24,500
Cereal!

643
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,700
Sure.

644
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,500
- I made some coffee for you.
- Great, thanks.

645
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,500
Did you fuck her?

646
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,000
What?

647
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,800
My mother.
Did you fuck her?

648
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,500
No.

649
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:09,300
You... liar!
I can smell her on you.

650
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:17,000
You're not the first,
did you know that?

651
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,300
Could I have some milk?

652
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,700
She's had a lot of young ones like yourself,
she eats you up like chocolates.

653
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,800
A spoon?
Could I have a spoon?

654
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:40,900
Do you know she does it till she's
done in a whole box of chocolates?

655
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:49,800
She sticks her finger down her
throat, and it all comes back up.

656
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,400
- You must have done really well in school.
- Straight A's.

657
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,900
- Food!
- Good!

658
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,500
Food! Hungry!

659
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,000
- I'm kind of hungry.
- Hungry!

660
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,500
- Very good.
- Good... Thirsty? Yes.

661
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:01,300
Two... one... go!

662
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:23,500
Almost!

663
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:34,900
- You ever thought about leaving?
- Only about a million times.

664
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,700
Why don't you?

665
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,700
I am. Very soon,
I'm going to Papua New Guinea.

666
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:47,400
- Ever thought about Alaska?
- Oh, why would I go... why would I go there?

667
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:50,600
It's very beautiful.
Very beautiful.

668
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:56,200
In my dream... You know, the movie dream?
There was this place on the Bering Sea.

669
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:00,700
It's completely flat, and really,
really quiet, you know?

670
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:04,900
Not even the wind whistling, because there's
nothing for the wind to whistle against.

671
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:07,700
And there's a boat...

672
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,200
...and then...

673
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,100
- ...and then, you know, there's the Eskimos.
- Yeah, the Eskimos!

674
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:20,100
You know what the Eskimos do with their
old people? Push them out on ice floes to die!

675
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:21,300
- No!
- That was just said...

676
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,100
No, they don't do that!

677
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,800
Elaine, I was trying
to tell you the other night.

678
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:29,000
Eskimos believe that
even though you die...

679
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,300
...you're never...

680
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:34,300
...really dead.

681
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,600
What are you then?

682
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,300
Um... You're infinity.

683
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:44,900
See, they believe that when
the physical suit of skin dies...

684
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,200
...it becomes part of the earth...

685
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:49,800
...but your soul...

686
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,500
...keeps going, you know...

687
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,200
...into other things like... um...

688
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,100
...trees...

689
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:57,800
...or fish...

690
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,600
...or rocks...

691
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:03,300
...or even other people, who are
actually, at that point, you.

692
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:07,100
What if you don't like
what you turned into?

693
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,700
Um...

694
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,700
Shit!

695
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:17,900
You just wait. Wait a few years,
then you turn into something else.

696
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,600
And love works
the same way as so like...

697
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:26,100
...if... if you and I
went down in a plane crash...

698
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:30,700
...that would be okay, because
our souls would keep going, you know?

699
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:35,700
And we'd love each other over and
over, from place to place, because...

700
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,200
...because it's infinity.

701
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:43,000
- And you wanna go there with me?
- Yeah.

702
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:50,000
We would love each other
over and over, for infinity.

703
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,400
Elaine...

704
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,900
...we're going to the Bering Sea,
we'll be in love, and we'll never die.

705
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:03,200
Never die. Leave tomorrow,
we can leave right now.

706
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:06,100
Okay.

707
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,700
Good afternoon.

708
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:34,100
- Hope we're not disturbing anything.
- What are you doing here, Leo?

709
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,600
- Axel, is that how you say hello?
- Just hold it.

710
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:39,700
Mrs. Stalker, nice seeing you again.

711
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,600
Axel, want you to get your
things together, we can get going.

712
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,700
I'm not going anywhere, Leo.

713
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,300
I bet you're gonna come.

714
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:49,600
- Paul, just hold it, alright?
- Alright.

715
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,600
- Hello, darling.
- Mrs. Stalker, if we could... um...

716
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:55,900
...just be privately for a moment?

717
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,000
Yes.

718
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,900
- So you're working on the old airplane, huh?
- Don't touch it!

719
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,500
Oh, I'm sorry.
Axel, I'm sorry.

720
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,900
Yes. Great.
Great. Great.

721
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:27,300
Don't you think... um...

722
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:31,800
...maybe you should be with your sick uncle,
instead of playing co-pilot with the nutcase here?

723
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,000
- You know, this whole airplane...
- What did you say?

724
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,300
- ...you know the airplane thing...
- What did you say?

725
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:36,700
You know what this is for her?
Wanna know what this is for her?

726
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,500
- This is a job like a prescription.
- The name?

727
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:39,400
- What was the name?
- This is a prescription.

728
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,800
What was the name you called her?
What was the name you called her?

729
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,200
- Oh, I called her a name, right?
- Yeah.

730
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,500
- Just now...
- I mean...

731
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:47,000
What did I call her? I can't remember.
I think I called her...

732
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:49,800
I remember... Psycho!
I called her psychopath, right?

733
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:52,700
Psycho!
When you gonna get it, Axel?

734
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:03,600
- Ah... Nothing like freshly brewed coffee.
- It's instant.

735
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,600
I knew that, Mrs. Stalker.
I don't like conflict.

736
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:12,800
- No one said you did, Mr. Smiley.
- Sweetie. It's Sweetie.

737
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:16,000
And I know that
no one said that I did.

738
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:19,500
That's right, but we should
get down to business.

739
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,100
We don't have any business,
Mr. Smiley.

740
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,000
- Swe... Sweetie.
- Sweetie.

741
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,100
- Try that. Sweetie.
- Sweetie.

742
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,200
Good.
Very... very nice.

743
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:32,000
Yeah, we do have business.
I want him returned to me.

744
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:36,400
He's a man, not an object,
Mr. Smi... Swe... Sweetie.

745
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:39,000
A stranger doesn't tell
a father what a son is.

746
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:43,100
I think if you take a look around,
you'll find it's not me who's the stranger.

747
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,700
Mrs. Stalker,
let me put it this way:..

748
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,800
- You see that '65 Coup de Ville over there?
- It's a '66, not a '65.

749
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:54,700
I beg your pardon, it's a '65...

750
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:59,400
...and although it's a very nice car,
it needs suspension work done in the front.

751
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,700
Suspension is perfect.
I just had it checked.

752
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:04,300
Fine.
Then it needs a new alignment.

753
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:07,300
Did you come here
to give me automotive advice?

754
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:11,500
Even though it's an older model,
it still retains its poise and its style.

755
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,500
- Sugar?
- No, thank you. I never use it.

756
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:18,200
Now, just imagine
if you will, Mrs. Stalker...

757
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:23,400
A brand new Coup de Ville.
Fresh from the factory.

758
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,500
Sitting alongside your '65.

759
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,700
The beautiful lines
of the older model...

760
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:34,400
...lose their elegance. The body sags,
the finish is dull. So you wash it...

761
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:39,200
...you wax it, but it's still lifeless.
And there isn't a thing you can do.

762
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,400
Mr. Smiley...

763
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:44,000
There isn't a thing you can do
to make it new again!

764
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:49,300
Those two automobiles do not belong
together. Am I making myself clear?

765
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:53,500
- No, the only thing that's clear, Mr. Smiley...
- No! Sweetie!

766
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:58,300
...Mr. Smiley, is that your feeble
attempts to insult me with car metaphors...

767
01:01:58,300 --> 01:01:59,400
...are incredibly immature!

768
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:03,300
Immature! Right! You're
old enough to be his mother!

769
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:07,400
But I'm not, Mr. Sweetie.
I'm his lover.

770
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:14,300
And I must tell you, your nephew
is a wild animal in bed.

771
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,600
Perhaps you might ask him
for lessons.

772
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,800
My reaction has one old regret
for my nephew.

773
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:22,100
I had hoped his sexual awakening...

774
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:26,400
...would've been with someone that knew the
difference between making love and fucking!

775
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:36,200
Oh! Come on!

776
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:39,800
Ok! Coffee break is over, fellas.
Back to work!

777
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:45,000
- Come on, Paul! Axel, up! Come on!
- Well, I'm not going, I'm not going!

778
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:48,100
- Paul, grab the other arm!
- Come on! Come on, Axel!

779
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:51,200
I'm gonna kick the shit out of you,
you little son-of-a-bitch!

780
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:55,300
- Come on, Axel!
- You obviously don't realize how angry I am.

781
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:57,500
- Just come along!
- I'm really mad!

782
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:00,200
- I know!
- Take your hands off him, Mr. Smilie!

783
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,600
It's Sweetie!

784
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:06,800
Elaine, you can't shoot me,
I have this performance on Friday.

785
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,800
Elaine! It's an audition.

786
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:10,100
It's an auditon.

787
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:13,800
It's not a performance, Elaine. It's an
audition. He's lying to you. It's an audition.

788
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,100
That... This is ridiculous... Um...

789
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:19,700
I mean... uh...

790
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:23,900
What I mean to say is... um... Mrs. Stalker,
we've said a lot of things, and...

791
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:28,600
...some were half kidding, but...
Why don't you put down the gun?

792
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,700
Uh... th... that I understand.
That makes sense, but... um...

793
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,400
But I'm not going to go around
for any more of that.

794
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:40,500
Axel, don't forget,
Friday at 8:30!

795
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:42,500
Oh, yes!

796
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:46,900
Oh, yes! We get in the car
and go back to where we should be!

797
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:57,300
<i>I knew if Paul saw me trying
to build a flying machine...</i>

798
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,900
<i>...he would never understand that going
to Papua New Guinea wasn't the answer.</i>

799
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:02,900
<i>Flying was the secret.</i>

800
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,000
<i>If Columbus were alive today...</i>

801
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:08,700
<i>...I don't think he'd think I was crazy for
trying to make a machine that would fly.</i>

802
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:11,000
<i>Because history is all dreams.</i>

803
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:13,800
<i>No rules or books,
it's just there.</i>

804
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:18,300
<i>Waiting to be discovered like when Columbus
crossed the Atlantic and found this whole place.</i>

805
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:22,500
<i>I don't know if he found the dream he was
looking for, but maybe he didn't have a choice.</i>

806
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:23,900
Fuck with me, now!

807
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,800
<i>Because once you're in the middle
of a storm, you can't turn back.</i>

808
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:29,600
<i>Elaine was waiting the same way.</i>

809
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:32,600
<i>And there was no place
to sail with straight ahead.</i>

810
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:36,800
<i>And if she asked me to build a rocket,
and take her to another galaxy...</i>

811
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,400
<i>...I'd build a rocket.</i>

812
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:22,000
Very nice! Oh, good.

813
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:24,400
Excellent!

814
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:25,900
- You finished now?
- No!

815
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,500
- No?
- No!

816
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,500
Alright!
You just finish.

817
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,900
<i>Whenever I try
to remember my dreams...</i>

818
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:35,800
<i>...I always turn them into stories.
But dreams are like life.</i>

819
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:40,000
<i>You can't catch them in your hands, because
you can't catch something you don't really see.</i>

820
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:44,300
<i>If you believe in your dreams,
you could be surer than any force...</i>

821
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:47,500
<i>...a tornado, volcano or typhoon...</i>

822
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,500
<i>...wouldn't be able
to knock you "out of love".</i>

823
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,800
<i>Because love exists on its own.</i>

824
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:53,300
Listen to me!

825
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,600
If you ever touch
this flying machine again...

826
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,600
...I'm gonna fucking kill you!

827
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:02,900
<i>Being caught in the dream of two women is
the craziest storm you ever find yourself in.</i>

828
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:07,100
<i>And the battle is never a fight of good
and evil, but between weaker and stronger.</i>

829
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,000
<i>And the weaker is always
desperate for air.</i>

830
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:14,600
<i>At this moment, my feet were
planted in the ground like a tree.</i>

831
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,200
<i>And if you moved to one side,
you become the storm.</i>

832
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:20,700
<i>And even though I was ready
to kill Grace...</i>

833
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:23,500
<i>...I wasn't sure which side
of the storm I'd move to.</i>

834
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:26,700
<i>So I tried to anchor myself
until the storm passed.</i>

835
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,500
Disgusting!

836
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:20,200
Turn around!

837
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,800
- That's the second time.
- What is?

838
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:03,000
- Where were you two minutes ago, huh?
- Here.

839
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:06,100
- You smashed the flying machine again, didn't you?
- No.

840
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:08,700
- Nope! 'Cause I don't care.
- Liar!

841
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:12,500
- All night I've been here.
- Prove it!

842
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:17,000
I don't know how to. I have...
Are you seeing me playing, right?

843
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:19,600
- To my turtles.
- Why's your hair wet?

844
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,200
Because I just took a bath.

845
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:28,100
- You like these turtles?
- Yeah.

846
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:33,500
If you want these filthy little bastards to live,
you'll stay away from that fucking flying machine.

847
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:36,400
- I'm scared.
- Are you scared?

848
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:37,400
- I'm scared.
- Are you scared?

849
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:38,600
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

850
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:39,600
Yeah.

851
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,100
- Do you think it'll fly?
- Oh, yeah, I'm more than sure.

852
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:15,600
Let's do it then!
I can't wait any longer.

853
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,900
I'm flying!

854
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:13,500
I'm flying!

855
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:15,800
I'm fly..!

856
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:58,100
<i>Sometimes you have to crash your
head into a tree to know what to do...</i>

857
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:01,700
<i>...and realize the secret of anything
is meaningless.</i>

858
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:04,500
<i>I'm not sure
why I remember that...</i>

859
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,100
<i>...but my English teacher in high school
talked about this Russian guy...</i>

860
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:10,900
<i>...who said that if you see a gun
in the first half of a book...</i>

861
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:14,100
<i>...you can be sure
it'll go off in the second half.</i>

862
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:17,900
<i>Somebody was gonna
have to use that gun.</i>

863
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,300
<i>The minute I first saw
the revolver in the barn...</i>

864
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:24,000
<i>...I started getting nervous,
because I realized...</i>

865
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,300
<i>...it was the same exact revolver
from my dream.</i>

866
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:32,500
<i>Never in my life did I think I'd be
an Eskimo in the middle of a desert...</i>

867
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:37,500
<i>...knowing I had to kill something
to put something out of its misery.</i>

868
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:43,200
<i>And suddenly, it all became clear to me,
like wiping the window out in the rain.</i>

869
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:49,600
<i>I was afraid if I didn't do anything,
at any moment something would blow up...</i>

870
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:51,800
<i>...possibly me.</i>

871
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:57,500
<i>So I decided right down to go and do it,
just to keep from killing myself.</i>

872
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:03,700
<i>The only problem was that
they were both so miserable.</i>

873
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:07,100
<i>I didn't know which one to shoot.</i>

874
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:49,200
- I've been waiting for you.
- What?

875
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:51,100
Are you gonna use it?

876
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:56,800
- Don't talk to me.
- Do it!

877
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:02,000
What are you afraid of, Axel?

878
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:04,600
Nothing.

879
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:10,700
Do it!

880
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:23,800
- Do it, Axel, do it!
- Shut up!

881
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:27,300
- What are you afraid of, Axel?
- Nothing.

882
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:29,400
- Do it!
- Shut up!

883
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:30,900
- Do it!
- Shut up!

884
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,200
- Do it!
- Please shut up, Grace.

885
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:36,200
- Do it! Do it!
- Shut up!

886
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:41,500
Oh, if you're not gonna shoot me,
sit down on the bed, Axel.

887
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:46,900
You didn't come here to shoot me.
You came here to make my mother happy.

888
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,500
Don't talk anymore!

889
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:51,800
- Axel.
- Turn around!

890
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:54,300
- Turn around!
- You know what! Axel!

891
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:57,400
I had a friend
who was just like you.

892
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,400
When we were little,
we were rollerskating on my roof.

893
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:03,600
Huge... huge roof.

894
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:04,800
No people.

895
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:09,900
And I would keep rollerskating
and each time, I'd get closer to the edge...

896
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,100
And he was standing behind me...

897
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:17,300
- Oh, God!
- ...just like you...

898
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,700
...and never let me go.

899
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:29,900
Okay.

900
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:31,800
It's okay.

901
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,300
I have a game for you.

902
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,500
- Okay.
- Okay.

903
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:55,000
Old game.
Strict rules.

904
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,600
Okay.

905
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,100
Okay.

906
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:20,700
- It's your turn.
- No.

907
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,900
You don't say no to this game.

908
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:27,100
- No.
- Okay. Okay, I'll take your turn. Okay.

909
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:30,400
Grace.

910
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,500
Grace... please!

911
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,200
- Grace!
- Shh.

912
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:36,800
- Don't.
- It's a game, Axel.

913
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,900
- Stop! Don't do it, please!
- Shh.

914
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:41,800
My mother's sleeping.

915
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:44,900
- Okay, Axel, Look.
- Fuck you!

916
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:46,500
- Look at me!
- Fuck you!

917
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:50,500
No!

918
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,700
Here. Take it.

919
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:02,300
I don't want it.

920
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,200
What... what are you?
Afraid?

921
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:06,900
No, Grace, I'm not afraid of anything.
I... I just don't feel like dying.

922
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:10,000
- But that's not fair.
- That's not fair.

923
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:12,600
No! You came here to kill me...

924
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:16,100
...and we're playing a game right now,
you're breaking the rules!

925
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:21,200
Axel, what are you,
like this frightened little boy?

926
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:23,600
You're just afraid of everything?

927
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:25,100
Huh?

928
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:29,000
Axel? You're just afraid, huh?

929
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:33,900
You're just a little boy, huh?
Oh, you're so scared.

930
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:36,300
Come on!
Take the gun!

931
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:38,500
Take it!

932
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:24,300
Go!

933
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,400
You don't!

934
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:36,600
No, Axel!

935
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:40,600
You can't do that!
That's breaking the rules!

936
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,400
Axel.

937
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:45,900
It's gonna be okay.

938
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,800
<i>Do you see...</i>

939
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:54,300
<i>You people...</i>

940
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:56,000
<i>Gazing at me...</i>

941
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:04,000
<i>You see a doll on a music box
that's found by a key...</i>

942
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:08,000
<i>How can you tell...</i>

943
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:11,700
<i>I'm under a spell...</i>

944
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:18,300
<i>I'm waiting for love's first kiss...</i>

945
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:23,400
<i>You cannot see...</i>

946
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:26,900
<i>How much I long to be free...</i>

947
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:35,200
<i>Turning around on this music box
that's found by a key...</i>

948
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:39,700
<i>Turning...</i>

949
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:43,600
<i>Yearning...</i>

950
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,200
<i>I'm... I'm...</i>

951
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:51,100
<i>Turning around and around...</i>

952
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:53,500
<i>And around...</i>

953
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:56,400
<i>And around...</i>

954
01:21:57,100 --> 01:21:59,100
<i>And...</i>

955
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:16,100
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen!

956
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:22,000
Our next act,
Mr. Paul Ledger!

957
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:28,100
- Le... Leger. Leger. Paul Leger.
- Paul Leger!

958
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,400
Uh...

959
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:43,000
My n... Hello.
My name is Paul Leger.

960
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:47,400
A lot of you may be wondering
what Leger means.

961
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:50,900
A lot of you may be wondering
what kind of name it is.

962
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:52,500
Is it Italian?

963
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,100
Or is it Swedish?

964
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:59,000
Well, actually, it's a French name,
and it literally means...

965
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:00,600
..."Born to act."

966
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:04,100
And that's exactly
what I'm gonna do for you...

967
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:05,700
...uh... this evening.

968
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,700
I'm gonna be
Alfred Hitchcock style.

969
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:14,000
I'm gonna be performing from the master's
classic, "North by Norths... Northwest."

970
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,300
The famous scene in which Alfred...

971
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:22,800
The famous scene in which Cary Grant
is being chased by a crop-dusting plane.

972
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:01,500
Fuck!

973
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,100
Shit!

974
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:22,900
- Thank you very much, Paul Leger!
- I'm not... I'm not done!

975
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:23,900
The judges are.

976
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,700
I'm not done yet!

977
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,500
I'm not done!

978
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,700
- Come on!
- I'm not done yet!

979
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:52,800
Thank you! Oh!

980
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:05,500
Thank you! Thank you!

981
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:10,100
A one? One? I was brilliant!
Can't you see brilliance?

982
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:12,700
A one? You... you see that!
I should have got a ten!

983
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:16,400
<i>A ten! And give me a one?
A one? What? On amateur night?</i>

984
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:20,200
- Axel! Axel, I really have to talk to you.
- Hi, Millie. Hi, Millie. You sit down.

985
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:22,300
<i>A one?
What do you know about art?</i>

986
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:25,400
- Yeah! Can we go over there?
- Sure. Sure.

987
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:26,600
Hey! Uh...

988
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:29,400
- Elaine. This is Elaine. This is Millie.
- Hi.

989
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,700
- Hello.
- Leo's... Leo's... uh...

990
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,300
- ...fianc�e.
- Oh!

991
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:34,400
This is Grace.

992
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:35,600
- Hi.
- Grace, this is Millie.

993
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:36,800
Hi.

994
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,300
Alright. Okay.

995
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,600
Leo?

996
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:55,200
Leo!

997
01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:01,200
- Where is he, Millie? Leo!
- Leo?

998
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:03,500
He's over here.
He's locked himself in the bedroom.

999
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,900
Leo, can I come in?

1000
01:27:07,700 --> 01:27:09,400
Open the door, Leo!

1001
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,800
- Open up!
- Go away!

1002
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:17,900
- Let's go inside.
- Alright. One... two... three!

1003
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:23,200
Leo?

1004
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:26,300
Leo!

1005
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:33,500
Millie! Get an...
get an ambulance, Millie!

1006
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:37,800
You're okay.
You're okay.

1007
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:47,900
Shouldn't I say something?

1008
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:50,800
- To who?
- Your parents.

1009
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
It's her mark.
They're dead, Leo.

1010
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,400
Yes, I know that, but...
should I say something or not?

1011
01:27:57,500 --> 01:28:01,900
- Don't talk like that. You're gonna be fine.
- Yes, I know, I'm gonna be fine.

1012
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:28,200
Promise me that you'll take
care of Millie after the funeral.

1013
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:29,500
Don't say that!

1014
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:33,300
Don't talk, just promise.

1015
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:36,000
Alright, I promise.

1016
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:41,700
Good, now that that's taken care of,
I want you to buy yourself...

1017
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,300
...a few nice suits
and go back to New York.

1018
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:48,400
I wanna stay with you.
I wanna sell cars.

1019
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:53,500
I don't want you to sell cars!
You're gonna grow up soon enough!

1020
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:55,800
I am grown up, Leo.

1021
01:28:57,700 --> 01:28:58,900
I love you.

1022
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:05,400
Leo! Leo!

1023
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:08,600
Oh, I'm okay. I'm just...

1024
01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:11,400
...just stacking cars.

1025
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:14,700
I need you to help me.

1026
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:17,200
It's too late.

1027
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:21,700
They're not driving
the big models anymore.

1028
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:29,300
Leo, we can work in the showroom
together, we can sell cars together...

1029
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,100
...you and me.

1030
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:37,300
- It's too late, Axel, the dream is over.
- I've been practicing my "hellos," Leo.

1031
01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:39,800
You wanna hear my "Hellos"?

1032
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:41,600
Leo?

1033
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:46,500
I gotta start climbing.

1034
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:50,900
It's a long way, Axel.

1035
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:56,300
It's a long way to the moon.

1036
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,400
Leo!

1037
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:08,500
Leo!

1038
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:48,000
Leo...

1039
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:22,300
You never came back.

1040
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,900
There was a lot of legal stuff
to take care of. I'm sorry.

1041
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:34,100
So not even a phone call?

1042
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:39,800
I know, Elaine. I just, you know,
got caught up in everything what was going on.

1043
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:42,800
I'm really sorry. I wanted to
call a thousand times, you know.

1044
01:32:43,700 --> 01:32:45,200
I'm really sorry.

1045
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:51,500
So what you just... um... make you decide
to pop over? For a quick cup of coffee?

1046
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:53,500
You can't just waltz over here
and tell me you feel like it.

1047
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:55,500
- Elaine, please, it's your birthday tomorrow.
- Well...

1048
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:57,700
- Please.
- ...what do you care? What do you care?

1049
01:32:58,200 --> 01:32:59,700
'Cause my uncle died, I'm sorry...

1050
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:00,900
- ...I didn't come back sooner...
- Well, well, look.

1051
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,100
- ...but I had to, you know...
- If you're looking for sympathy...

1052
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:03,200
- ...take care of the funeral and everything.
- ...you've come to the wrong place.

1053
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:05,500
It's the wrong place to come,
if you're looking for sympathy.

1054
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,600
Okay?
Is that okay with you?

1055
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:16,400
Please, let me
to celebrate your birthday.

1056
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:18,200
What do you care?

1057
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:20,500
What do you...
what do you care, huh?

1058
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:23,100
Well, look!
You know what you should do?

1059
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:26,300
You should just turn around... turn around
and go back where you came from.

1060
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:28,600
Just go back
where you came from, okay?

1061
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:32,100
How's Millie, huh?

1062
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:34,400
Millie?

1063
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:36,900
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

1064
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:39,400
- What did you say? Tell me to go?
- Well... well... you... you...

1065
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:40,900
Are you just going?
You're just gonna go now?

1066
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:41,700
- Just go now?
- What did you say?

1067
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:43,700
Are you just gonna leave the hell
or you're going for now?

1068
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:45,500
You're going for long time,
how long you're going for?

1069
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:47,100
- Are you going forever?
- Do I stay, or you want me to go?

1070
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:48,200
- What do you want?
- I...

1071
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:51,000
- What do you want?
- I want you to go! I want you to go!

1072
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,800
- Fine!
- I want you...

1073
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:58,200
I want you to come!

1074
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:11,400
So what do you wanna do?
You wanna go or you wanna stay?

1075
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:14,900
I wanna stay.

1076
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:17,600
I don't think
you need this right now.

1077
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:18,800
You know?

1078
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:24,800
She'll be okay. She just gets like
this, some time she'll be alright.

1079
01:34:25,700 --> 01:34:30,100
Um... Alright, but I'm not
staying in there tonight, okay?

1080
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:47,300
Elaine?

1081
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:49,800
It's gonna be okay.

1082
01:34:50,700 --> 01:34:52,500
Nothing is gonna be okay!

1083
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:54,700
Come on!

1084
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:56,600
Hey... uh...

1085
01:34:56,600 --> 01:35:00,400
Elaine! Wait, wait, wait!
I... I brought you a present.

1086
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:04,900
- I don't want it!
- You don't even know what it is, Elaine!

1087
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:07,800
Elaine, you don't know what it is.

1088
01:35:09,700 --> 01:35:12,700
- Come on, Elaine, please. Just take it.
- I don't want it.

1089
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:14,700
- I don't want it.
- It's a present!

1090
01:35:14,700 --> 01:35:16,600
- I don't want it!
- Please! It's a present!

1091
01:35:16,700 --> 01:35:19,800
- Thank you for the wad of paper.
- It's not a wad of paper, Elaine...

1092
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:23,200
...it's... it's two tickets for Shishmaref.
It's right on the Bering Sea.

1093
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:26,600
- Train ticket?
- Yeah.

1094
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:30,600
You expect me me to go
all the way to Alaska by train?

1095
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:32,700
Well, you said you didn't
wanna fly again, so I just...

1096
01:35:32,700 --> 01:35:33,500
No, I didn't!

1097
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:34,900
- Yes, you did!
- No, I didn't!

1098
01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:36,200
- Yes, you did!
- No, I didn't!

1099
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:38,500
- Yes, you did!
- I... I... I... I want to fly there.

1100
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:39,900
Okay!

1101
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:45,600
Okay!

1102
01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:48,900
Okay!

1103
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:54,900
I'm gonna... I'm gonna cancel the train tickets and
I'm gonna make a plane reservation, it's okay?

1104
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,800
- Alright.
- Stop!

1105
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:01,000
What?

1106
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:04,000
You think I'm old, don't you?

1107
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:07,300
- No!
- Yes, you think! You think I'm old.

1108
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:08,600
Don't tell me what I think.

1109
01:36:08,700 --> 01:36:10,900
That's why you wanna go by train,
you're ashamed to be with me!

1110
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:12,900
I'm not ashamed, Elaine.
I'm gonna go trade these tickets in.

1111
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:16,100
No! No, no, no! Listen!
I don't blame you. You're right!

1112
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:19,400
I'm old, you're young.
You're right! It's disgusting!

1113
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:20,900
Just stop it!

1114
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:23,100
Wh...wh...wh...what did I have?
Can't you find someone your own age?

1115
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:24,200
Why are you with me?

1116
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:26,800
- I... I... I wanna be with you!
- But I don't need your goddamn pity!

1117
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:28,900
- I'm not giving you any goddamn pity, Elaine.
- I don't need that. Then what? What do you do?

1118
01:36:28,900 --> 01:36:30,500
- What do you give me?
- I'm trying to give you everything.

1119
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:31,700
- What? What?
- I'm trying to give you love.

1120
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:33,300
Oh, love.

1121
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:35,800
- What do you know about love?
- What... what do you know?

1122
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:38,500
What?
You're a child.

1123
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:42,500
I know what you need is
someone... sweet...

1124
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:45,200
...and beautiful...

1125
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:48,900
- ...and young!
- Like who?

1126
01:36:50,300 --> 01:36:51,800
Like Millie.

1127
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:56,300
- She's like Switzerland, beautiful, but dumb.
- I want you to listen to me.

1128
01:36:57,100 --> 01:37:01,200
She was my uncle's fianc�e.
I don't want her. I want you!

1129
01:37:02,300 --> 01:37:03,900
This is crazy!

1130
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:07,000
Ro... Ronny used to say that,
and Grace still says it...

1131
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,000
..."Take your medication, Mother,
or you'll be crazy."

1132
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:14,500
But he hurt her,
and I killed him...

1133
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,900
- ...and I'm not crazy!
- I'm not your fucking husband, either! I'm me!

1134
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:20,800
- Do you understand? You are fucking crazy.
- Get out!

1135
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:23,500
- You're fucking crazy!
- Get out!

1136
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:25,300
- No, I'm not leaving! I'm not going anywhere!
- Get out!

1137
01:37:25,300 --> 01:37:27,200
- Get out of my house!
- You just asked me to stay!

1138
01:37:27,100 --> 01:37:29,200
I did not!
I want you to go!

1139
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:32,500
- Go!
- I'm pretty fucking tired of this game, Elaine.

1140
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:34,100
What do you want?

1141
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:39,300
- What do you want?
- I... I want you to understand me!

1142
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:42,300
- You know something?
- What?

1143
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:43,900
Paul was right.

1144
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,300
- Paul was right?
- Paul was right.

1145
01:37:49,300 --> 01:37:51,000
Paul was right?

1146
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:54,900
I can't believe that you would listen to anything
he would have to say about me. What did he say?

1147
01:37:54,900 --> 01:37:56,900
- Nothing.
- How nothing? What did he say?

1148
01:37:56,900 --> 01:37:59,300
- Didn't say a fucking thing!
- I'm gonna find out what Paul said about me.

1149
01:37:59,300 --> 01:38:00,400
- Find out who...
- No, you're going nowhere.

1150
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:01,500
- You're going nowhere.
- Shall I go... Did you think I'm...

1151
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:02,600
- You're going nowhere!
- Axel, I will not...

1152
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:04,900
Where you gonna go?
You'll go nowhere while I'm here.

1153
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:07,900
- Let me go!
- Come on... Come on, Elaine, come on.

1154
01:38:07,900 --> 01:38:10,000
You're not crazy.
Show me you're not crazy!

1155
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:12,200
- Come on!
- Let me go!

1156
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:15,200
I don't think you're old.

1157
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:19,000
I think you're beautiful now. Don't say it again.
Do you understand? I don't wanna hear it!

1158
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:21,200
Let me go!

1159
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:22,900
Stop!

1160
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:27,500
- Elaine? Elaine!
- Get out of my life!

1161
01:38:27,700 --> 01:38:28,800
- Get out of my house or...
- Lie it down!

1162
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:30,800
- Put it down!
- Get out of my house!

1163
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:36,100
- My leg!
- It's alright! It' okay!

1164
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:38,300
- That's enough!
- No!

1165
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:40,100
That's enough!

1166
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:11,700
Wow!

1167
01:39:40,700 --> 01:39:43,300
I can't believe she did it!

1168
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,800
Is it flying?

1169
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:25,200
You fucked my wife?

1170
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,900
You fucked my wife?

1171
01:42:24,700 --> 01:42:26,400
Oh, come on!

1172
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:30,000
Please! Please!

1173
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:32,600
Come on!

1174
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:36,700
Listen!
That's Mexico!

1175
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:40,500
That is Mexico. This is America.
We speak English.

1176
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:41,800
<i>Speak English.
Speak English.</i>

1177
01:42:41,900 --> 01:42:43,500
- Yes.
- Look at his face!

1178
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:50,700
What do you mean?
You're gonna tell me...

1179
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,200
Shit!

1180
01:43:57,400 --> 01:44:00,700
- Paul, would you quit screwing around?
- Can't you see I'm having a fucking nightmare?

1181
01:44:00,700 --> 01:44:02,100
Leave her alone!

1182
01:44:09,100 --> 01:44:11,900
You're distracting her.
She's trying to fly the plane.

1183
01:44:11,900 --> 01:44:13,900
Please! Please!

1184
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:15,500
This isn't happening!

1185
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:37,000
I hate this film!

1186
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:54,700
Life is beautiful.

1187
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,800
I think what you did is beautiful.

1188
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:06,400
Thanks.

1189
01:45:07,700 --> 01:45:09,700
I'm sorry about your uncle.

1190
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:13,900
Yeah, me too.

1191
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:17,700
Where do you think he is right now?

1192
01:45:19,100 --> 01:45:20,400
Right now?

1193
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:25,700
Right now I think he's
probably on the moon...

1194
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:28,400
...driving a golden Cadillac.

1195
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:34,700
<i>Life is beautiful.</i>

1196
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:38,800
- Grace?
- Yeah?

1197
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:41,200
Um...

1198
01:45:42,500 --> 01:45:46,200
Do you think it would be
really bad if I... uh... uh...

1199
01:45:48,700 --> 01:45:51,000
- ...kissed you?
- No.

1200
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,200
No?

1201
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:22,100
- I'm sorry!
- Oh, you wanna hear now?

1202
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:25,700
<i>- I'm sorry.
- Are you gonna listen this time?</i>

1203
01:46:25,700 --> 01:46:27,200
<i>- Yeah, yeah, yeah!
- Alright.</i>

1204
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:28,400
<i>Anyway...</i>

1205
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:32,900
Elaine is like a blueberry pie. Okay?
The pie is good, but it's very messy.

1206
01:46:32,900 --> 01:46:36,000
- And she's a kind of a... a trick.
- Oh, my gosh!

1207
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,300
<i>- Let's say she's a blueberry pie...
- Oh, my gosh!</i>

1208
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:39,900
<i>...blueberry pie.</i>

1209
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:42,500
She looks good.
She smells good.

1210
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:46,600
She probably even tastes good,
but there's one little problem:..

1211
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:48,400
She's full of a little sprits...

1212
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:51,800
...because when you take a bite, you've got
pins poking you in the mouth...

1213
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:53,700
...and they're choking you...
in the mouth.

1214
01:46:53,700 --> 01:46:56,800
Do you understand? Do you understand
what I'm trying to tell you?

1215
01:46:57,300 --> 01:46:59,300
Good boy. Good boy.
Do you understand?

1216
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:01,400
- Do you understand what I'm trying to tell you?
- Yes.

1217
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:03,300
- Okay!
- This philosophy is down with...

1218
01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:06,000
...with pies and bananas and...

1219
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:07,800
<i>- ...Q-tips and... and...
- What? What?</i>

1220
01:47:08,300 --> 01:47:10,800
<i>Yeah, well, I'm an artist.
What can I say?</i>

1221
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:13,000
You're a bullshit artist.

1222
01:47:13,100 --> 01:47:15,600
Bullshit artist, artist, what's the
difference? It's the same thing.

1223
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:18,600
- Art is art.
- Axel, it's my birthday. Dance.

1224
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:20,200
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1225
01:47:20,300 --> 01:47:22,000
<i>Run! Beautiful.</i>

1226
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:26,600
<i>Sure.</i>

1227
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:31,000
I was right.

1228
01:47:31,300 --> 01:47:33,600
<i>What time is the train
leaving for Alaska?</i>

1229
01:47:33,700 --> 01:47:36,900
- You mean the plane?
- No, I mean the train.

1230
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:40,300
We're not taking the train, we're
flying. Didn't you fly all day?

1231
01:47:40,300 --> 01:47:43,600
Oh, no, you can't take that all
the way to Alaska, it's too cold.

1232
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:45,800
I don't want to fly there.

1233
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:48,400
Elaine, I already changed
the reservations, you know.

1234
01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:51,100
We have to take the train.
It's safer.

1235
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:56,900
So... you want me to switch
the plane reservations and...

1236
01:47:56,900 --> 01:47:59,100
...and make them into
train reservations now?

1237
01:47:59,200 --> 01:48:01,100
- Yes.
- Okay.

1238
01:48:56,300 --> 01:48:57,800
It's time.

1239
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:16,800
...37, 38, 39, 40... 40...

1240
01:49:55,800 --> 01:49:58,900
Stairs, stairs, stairs...

1241
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:01,200
Wall... Axel?

1242
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:03,500
Axel, here, here.
Oh!

1243
01:50:04,100 --> 01:50:05,100
- Aw!
- I'm sorry.

1244
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:07,900
- Yeah!
- This way. This way.

1245
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:14,600
Oh! Don't touch me.
Watch my face.

1246
01:50:15,300 --> 01:50:16,800
- Axel?
- Please watch my face, alright?

1247
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:18,000
Wait.

1248
01:50:18,600 --> 01:50:20,200
Wait.

1249
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:28,000
Stairs! Stairs!

1250
01:50:29,300 --> 01:50:31,600
Axel! Stairs!

1251
01:50:32,100 --> 01:50:33,400
Tree!

1252
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:41,300
Tree and table!

1253
01:50:41,300 --> 01:50:43,100
- Move!
- Aw! Aw!

1254
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:46,100
Whoa, Axel, whoa!

1255
01:50:46,200 --> 01:50:48,200
Axel! Whoa!

1256
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:50,500
I can't see nothing.
Axel!

1257
01:50:53,700 --> 01:50:55,200
I can't see!

1258
01:50:56,200 --> 01:50:57,500
- Aw!
- Axel!

1259
01:50:57,500 --> 01:50:59,700
- What?
- Wait for me!

1260
01:51:01,300 --> 01:51:04,000
<i>Here it is!
I found it!</i>

1261
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,300
- Axel!
- What?

1262
01:51:05,300 --> 01:51:06,600
<i>Here!</i>

1263
01:51:06,700 --> 01:51:08,500
<i>- She found it!
- Here!</i>

1264
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:10,500
- She found it!
- Wait for me!

1265
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:13,300
I found it! I found it!

1266
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:15,900
Come on, I found it!

1267
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,600
<i>- Paul!
- Axel! I can't see nothing! Axel!</i>

1268
01:51:20,100 --> 01:51:22,000
<i>- Axel?
- Where are you?</i>

1269
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:23,300
- Axel!
- What?

1270
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:24,500
- Alright!
- Paul!

1271
01:51:24,500 --> 01:51:26,300
Here?
Okay everybody?

1272
01:51:29,900 --> 01:51:31,100
It's raining!

1273
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:33,700
It's raining!

1274
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:45,900
It's raining!

1275
01:51:46,900 --> 01:51:48,700
Come on, it's raining.

1276
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,600
<i>It's raining.</i>

1277
01:52:09,200 --> 01:52:11,200
<i>It's fucking raining!</i>

1278
01:52:13,400 --> 01:52:16,500
- Mom! Mother!
- Yes!

1279
01:52:17,900 --> 01:52:19,600
I'm coming over, mom!

1280
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:22,800
Mom! Here we go!
Happy Birthday!

1281
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:24,400
- I love you.
- I love you!

1282
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:26,900
- Happy Birthday!
- I love you.

1283
01:52:28,300 --> 01:52:30,400
I'm going in!

1284
01:53:04,300 --> 01:53:05,800
Go play.

1285
01:53:07,500 --> 01:53:08,800
Go play.

1286
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:13,200
Go play.

1287
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:20,200
Go play.

1288
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:30,300
Did I tell you time when Axel treated
me for my 21st birthday dinner?

1289
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:32,100
My good pal.

1290
01:53:32,700 --> 01:53:34,200
- No.
- Can I tell her the story?

1291
01:53:34,200 --> 01:53:36,700
- Or would you like to tell her?
- No, no, go ahead.

1292
01:53:37,200 --> 01:53:39,300
Anyway... uh... he decided...

1293
01:53:39,300 --> 01:53:43,900
...for my 21st birthday present, he was gonna
take me out to dinner and pay for it himself.

1294
01:53:44,500 --> 01:53:49,800
He'd saved up some money and decided he was
gonna take me to dinner, so we go to this restaurant.

1295
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:54,400
Uh... this place we used to go with Leo.
We drove up there together and... uh...

1296
01:53:55,300 --> 01:53:56,900
...we had this great meal.

1297
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,100
Big great meal...

1298
01:53:58,100 --> 01:54:02,300
...and I knew it would be expensive,
but he said, "The sky's the limit."

1299
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,300
<i>So anyway, after dinner
I have to go to the bathroom...</i>

1300
01:54:05,300 --> 01:54:07,700
<i>...and I go into the bathroom,
and when I come out of the bathroom...</i>

1301
01:54:07,700 --> 01:54:12,700
<i>...I see him standing by the door,
and he looks unusually nervous.</i>

1302
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:16,900
And I'm looking at the waiter and the waiter is
standing by our table kind of flapping the check...

1303
01:54:16,900 --> 01:54:20,500
...you know, on the table, he's... he's
kind of pointing at the check, you know.

1304
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:22,500
- And I'm looking at Axel and I call up to myself:..
- Will you come up?

1305
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:25,100
..."Listen! What's going on, lad?
Did you pay the check?"

1306
01:54:25,900 --> 01:54:27,900
Will you help me
wrap the presents?

1307
01:54:28,300 --> 01:54:29,700
"You said you were
paying for everthing."

1308
01:54:29,700 --> 01:54:30,300
- "Whaddya mean?"
- Okay.

1309
01:54:30,300 --> 01:54:32,300
"You made me not bring
any money with me."

1310
01:54:32,300 --> 01:54:34,100
I say, "Whaddya mean
you have no money?"

1311
01:54:34,300 --> 01:54:36,100
Anyway, next thing I know...

1312
01:54:36,100 --> 01:54:38,800
...we're running down the streets of
Tucson being chased by this wai...

1313
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:42,900
...our waiter who was... who was this fifty
year old guy, but he was like me...

1314
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:49,900
- Hi!
- Hi!

1315
01:54:58,200 --> 01:54:59,600
What's that?

1316
01:55:01,400 --> 01:55:03,300
- Huh?
- No! No!

1317
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:04,400
Nope!

1318
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,600
Very nice!

1319
01:55:08,600 --> 01:55:09,700
Wow!

1320
01:55:11,800 --> 01:55:13,500
I want you to have something.

1321
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:16,800
For me?

1322
01:55:19,100 --> 01:55:23,100
- It's beautiful.
- I want you to have the world.

1323
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,200
Thank you.

1324
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:32,700
- I was thinking about what you said.
- What did I say?

1325
01:55:33,700 --> 01:55:36,000
That I was supposed to be
with you.

1326
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,500
Could you hand me that tape?

1327
01:55:39,300 --> 01:55:40,400
Yeah.

1328
01:55:42,100 --> 01:55:43,200
You know...

1329
01:55:44,500 --> 01:55:48,700
...when I first met her,
I... I felt something kind of strong.

1330
01:55:50,200 --> 01:55:51,800
I didn't know what it was...

1331
01:55:51,900 --> 01:55:52,700
...you know?

1332
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,200
I... I didn't know what to call it.

1333
01:55:57,300 --> 01:56:01,800
Now everything's kind of turned
around, and... she's like... uh...

1334
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:05,600
...she's like this cloud...

1335
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:08,800
...that I can see through.

1336
01:56:09,800 --> 01:56:12,300
And on the other side,
I see you.

1337
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:20,300
And I feel something
very strong.

1338
01:56:25,700 --> 01:56:28,200
I think I know
what to call it, you know?

1339
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:34,500
That make any sense?

1340
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:38,800
Could you put your finger
here for a second?

1341
01:56:40,900 --> 01:56:43,600
Yeah. What do you think?

1342
01:56:45,300 --> 01:56:49,300
- About what?
- About us, kind of...

1343
01:56:49,600 --> 01:56:51,200
...belonging together.

1344
01:56:52,100 --> 01:56:55,100
What about this lamp?
Do you think Paul will like this lamp?

1345
01:56:55,100 --> 01:56:58,500
Yeah, he'll... he'll love it.
What do you think?

1346
01:57:02,700 --> 01:57:05,300
I think two wrongs
don't make a right.

1347
01:57:05,500 --> 01:57:09,200
- Meaning what?
- Meaning us. Two wrongs.

1348
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:15,100
What if we're not? What if we're two
rights, and everybody else is wrong?

1349
01:57:16,600 --> 01:57:18,200
Nah!

1350
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:21,500
- Either way, we're gonna be screwed, Axel.
- But this way we can be screwed together.

1351
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:24,000
Oh...

1352
01:57:24,400 --> 01:57:27,300
- ...I wish I could take you with me.
- Let's go!

1353
01:57:27,700 --> 01:57:29,600
Let's go right now!
No trains...

1354
01:57:29,700 --> 01:57:34,100
...no planes, no fucking doors.
We'll go right out the window!

1355
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Hey, I have to take care
of some business though.

1356
01:57:44,300 --> 01:57:46,800
- House?
- Yes.

1357
01:57:51,100 --> 01:57:56,100
Last night in my dream I'm standing in the middle
of the desert, and my house is tied around my neck...

1358
01:57:56,800 --> 01:58:02,000
...and my body's breaking under its weight,
and it's engulfed in flames, and the flames are...

1359
01:58:02,300 --> 01:58:04,300
...climbing up the rope, and they...

1360
01:58:04,600 --> 01:58:09,200
...they almost reach my neck, and right
before they do, I wake up, and I know...

1361
01:58:09,200 --> 01:58:11,800
...I know that I have to
get rid of this house.

1362
01:58:14,200 --> 01:58:18,200
- I want you to promise me something.
- What?

1363
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:21,900
That when you're done with
this house stuff...

1364
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:24,300
...we can go away.

1365
01:58:25,900 --> 01:58:27,200
Come on!

1366
01:58:28,100 --> 01:58:29,400
Come on!

1367
01:58:35,800 --> 01:58:37,200
I promise.

1368
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:40,000
- You promise?
- Yeah.

1369
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:42,200
I promise.

1370
01:58:44,500 --> 01:58:45,600
Good.

1371
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:56,200
It's funny.
I mean, it's a funny story.

1372
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:07,600
And I have a lot of
funny stories, you know.

1373
01:59:19,400 --> 01:59:20,900
Hey!

1374
01:59:21,100 --> 01:59:22,700
Here they are!

1375
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:26,400
<i>- Is this is for me?
- Yes.</i>

1376
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:28,200
<i>- You bought this for me?
- Yes.</i>

1377
01:59:28,200 --> 01:59:29,500
<i>- That's very nice.
- Yes.</i>

1378
01:59:31,300 --> 01:59:32,600
Here.

1379
01:59:35,300 --> 01:59:37,100
You open yours first.

1380
01:59:39,600 --> 01:59:41,200
See what I get?

1381
01:59:42,100 --> 01:59:44,100
I feel like a clam here, right?

1382
01:59:45,300 --> 01:59:48,800
I've always wanted to be a sea
turtle. They're always happy.

1383
01:59:49,400 --> 01:59:51,400
How do you know
when a turtle's happy?

1384
01:59:51,600 --> 01:59:54,700
Because if you look at their faces,
they're always smiling.

1385
01:59:54,700 --> 01:59:57,000
- Turtles don't smile, Grace.
- Yes, they do.

1386
01:59:57,100 --> 01:59:58,500
- No, they don't.
- Yes, they do.

1387
01:59:58,500 --> 01:59:59,400
- I...
- They can't smile.

1388
01:59:59,500 --> 02:00:00,400
I don't think turtles smile.

1389
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:03,900
Yes, yes, they do,
and they live forever.

1390
02:00:04,100 --> 02:00:06,200
- Who wants to live forever?
- See?

1391
02:00:06,200 --> 02:00:08,600
I'd like to die when I'm 35.

1392
02:00:09,900 --> 02:00:11,700
- You want to die when you're 35?
- Yes.

1393
02:00:11,700 --> 02:00:14,200
- How would you die when you're 35?
- How would I die when I'm 35?

1394
02:00:14,200 --> 02:00:16,000
How would I die?
I'll tell you how I'd die.

1395
02:00:16,100 --> 02:00:20,100
I'd take off all my clothes and get into
a bathtub filled with ice-cold vodka.

1396
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:24,300
And I'd have a TV in the room with me,
I'd be watching "North by Northwest".

1397
02:00:24,500 --> 02:00:29,200
So just when the scene comes with the airplane,
I'd pull the TV into the tub and shock myself.

1398
02:00:29,200 --> 02:00:30,800
I hate that film!

1399
02:00:32,300 --> 02:00:34,400
I'd like to die as a little girl.

1400
02:00:35,300 --> 02:00:39,600
I'd... I'd go up on the roof
and jump off, and I'd be flying.

1401
02:00:40,200 --> 02:00:42,700
Well, I mean, I'd look down see all the
people watch me from the ground...

1402
02:00:42,700 --> 02:00:45,800
...but instead of falling, I would just fly...

1403
02:00:45,900 --> 02:00:47,500
...higher and higher.

1404
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:51,600
<i>What did I get?</i>

1405
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:53,700
- What is this thing?
- Lava lamp.

1406
02:00:54,400 --> 02:00:56,200
- Axel?
- All these are nice. Thank you. Lamp.

1407
02:00:56,200 --> 02:00:59,400
- Axel? What about you?
- It's very nice.

1408
02:00:59,600 --> 02:01:01,200
- Thanks.
- I'd like to be...

1409
02:01:02,200 --> 02:01:08,000
...I'd like to be thrown off a cliff, and then
my body could smash into the rocks.

1410
02:01:09,800 --> 02:01:13,000
But I... I wouldn't want a lot of people
at the funeral, you know, 'cause I don't...

1411
02:01:13,500 --> 02:01:16,100
...I wouldn't want 'em to look at me.

1412
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:18,900
You'd be all smashed up. Why would
you want them to look at you?

1413
02:01:18,900 --> 02:01:20,500
I don't want them to look at me.

1414
02:01:20,700 --> 02:01:23,200
There... you're laying there in the box,
people staring at...

1415
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:25,800
- You'll wind up living forever.
- It's for all of us.

1416
02:01:27,400 --> 02:01:30,000
Grace. What about you?

1417
02:01:30,700 --> 02:01:33,200
Me?
I'm not going to die.

1418
02:01:33,300 --> 02:01:37,200
I'm gonna live forever until one
day I'll wake up and I'll be a turtle.

1419
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:40,000
Turtle Grace!

1420
02:01:48,200 --> 02:01:49,400
Sing it!

1421
02:02:10,200 --> 02:02:12,400
- Good night.
- Good night.

1422
02:02:13,700 --> 02:02:15,200
I love you.

1423
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:16,600
<i>Where you going?</i>

1424
02:02:18,300 --> 02:02:20,000
- Good night.
- What do you mean "good night"?

1425
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:23,400
What do you mean "good night"? We just
got by the fire. We're having a good time.

1426
02:02:24,300 --> 02:02:27,000
I've... I have to get up
and do things.

1427
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:29,500
- Stay with us a little while.
- Yes.

1428
02:02:30,300 --> 02:02:31,500
Come on. No?

1429
02:02:31,500 --> 02:02:35,600
- Come on!
- Okay, I'll see you. Good bye.

1430
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:38,400
Come on, Grace!

1431
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,400
<i>Is something wrong?
Did I say something?</i>

1432
02:03:05,200 --> 02:03:07,300
<i>Come on! Come on! Come on!</i>

1433
02:03:10,100 --> 02:03:11,400
<i>- Come on!
- Alright!</i>

1434
02:03:12,500 --> 02:03:13,500
<i>Sing!</i>

1435
02:03:29,500 --> 02:03:31,700
Axel, I'm tired too.
I'll be get going!

1436
02:03:31,700 --> 02:03:33,800
In the middle of the song!
We didn't finish the song.

1437
02:03:33,800 --> 02:03:35,700
- Are you coming, Axel?
- Yeah.

1438
02:03:36,500 --> 02:03:37,400
Good night.

1439
02:03:37,400 --> 02:03:38,900
That's it! Just leave me!

1440
02:03:38,900 --> 02:03:42,800
Leave me in the middle of a song! I had
a great moment! Just leave me like that!

1441
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,800
Go up and sleep,
leave me soaking wet here!

1442
02:03:47,600 --> 02:03:50,000
- Good night, Paul.
- Good night, Elaine.

1443
02:03:50,500 --> 02:03:52,400
- Wasn't that a funny story I said?
- Yeah!

1444
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:53,900
Yeah? What do you
know about funny?

1445
02:03:53,900 --> 02:03:56,600
Good dinner, throw the food
on the floor. That's real funny!

1446
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:59,300
Then you have a birthday cake,
and no one wants to cut the cake.

1447
02:03:59,500 --> 02:04:01,500
Well, I'll cut the cake,
thank you.

1448
02:04:02,100 --> 02:04:05,700
Happy birthday to me!
Happy birthday to Paul!

1449
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:08,000
That's me! Paul!

1450
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:12,000
Looks like she left about
45 candles off the cake.

1451
02:04:17,400 --> 02:04:21,400
Alright! Good!
Enough, enough, guys. Enough!

1452
02:04:21,500 --> 02:04:23,800
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Come on.

1453
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:31,000
I gotta work, okay? I work for money.
Time is money. Have a drink.

1454
02:04:45,900 --> 02:04:48,400
<i>Have a drink! You need it.
You need a drink. Go ahead.</i>

1455
02:04:48,500 --> 02:04:52,000
<i>Go home, and suffer with your
families. Suffer like animals! Yeah!</i>

1456
02:04:55,100 --> 02:05:00,300
<i>Why do I have to talk to four
fake artists? That's my day!</i>

1457
02:05:01,200 --> 02:05:02,500
<i>So good!</i>

1458
02:05:09,600 --> 02:05:10,900
Godfather!

1459
02:05:11,700 --> 02:05:18,100
<i>...big deal together, and that there was
something in it for me, if I could help him out.</i>

1460
02:05:18,100 --> 02:05:21,800
<i>He said that... He said that you were
being tough on the negotiations...</i>

1461
02:05:22,200 --> 02:05:26,300
<i>...but if they could get a little
help and close the deal fast...</i>

1462
02:05:26,700 --> 02:05:30,600
<i>- ...it... it'd be good for the family.
- Do you believe that, son?</i>

1463
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:36,100
<i>- Do you believe that?
- He said there was something in it for me!</i>

1464
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:39,400
<i>- On my own!
- I've always taken care of you.</i>

1465
02:05:40,300 --> 02:05:42,200
<i>Taken care of me?</i>

1466
02:05:43,500 --> 02:05:46,200
<i>You're my kid brother!
You take care of me?</i>

1467
02:05:46,600 --> 02:05:50,700
<i>You ever think about that?
You ever once think about that?</i>

1468
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:55,900
<i>Set Freddo off to do this!
Set Freddo on to do that!</i>

1469
02:05:56,900 --> 02:06:00,900
<i>Let Freddo take care of some
Mickey Mouse night club somewhere.</i>

1470
02:06:01,500 --> 02:06:04,300
<i>Send Freddo
to pick up somebody at the airport!</i>

1471
02:06:04,600 --> 02:06:07,700
<i>I'm your older brother, Mike,
and I was stepped over!</i>

1472
02:06:07,800 --> 02:06:11,100
<i>- That's the way Pop wanted it.
- It ain't the way I wanted it!</i>

1473
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:15,000
<i>I can handle things.
I'm smart!</i>

1474
02:06:15,100 --> 02:06:20,900
<i>Not like everybody says,
I'm smart and I want respect!</i>

1475
02:06:23,500 --> 02:06:27,200
<i>Is there anything you can
tell me about this investigation?</i>

1476
02:06:27,200 --> 02:06:28,300
<i>Any more?</i>

1477
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,400
<i>The Senate lawyer quest that.</i>

1478
02:06:33,200 --> 02:06:35,100
<i>He belongs to Wroth.</i>

1479
02:06:41,500 --> 02:06:43,000
<i>Freddo.</i>

1480
02:06:45,500 --> 02:06:47,200
<i>You're nothing to me now.</i>

1481
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,700
<i>You're not a brother,
you're not a friend.</i>

1482
02:06:54,200 --> 02:06:56,500
<i>I don't wanna know you,
or what you do.</i>

1483
02:06:58,300 --> 02:07:03,100
<i>I don't want to see you in hotels,
I don't want you near my house.</i>

1484
02:07:05,800 --> 02:07:07,600
<i>When you see our mother...</i>

1485
02:07:07,800 --> 02:07:10,600
<i>...I wanna know a day in advance,
so I won't be there.</i>

1486
02:07:12,400 --> 02:07:14,000
<i>Understand?</i>

1487
02:07:23,600 --> 02:07:25,300
<i>- Mikey!
- Mikey!</i>

1488
02:07:32,300 --> 02:07:36,000
<i>I don't want anything to happen to you,
not while our mother is alive.</i>

1489
02:09:42,500 --> 02:09:43,900
Grace!

1490
02:09:48,900 --> 02:09:50,200
Grace!

1491
02:09:51,400 --> 02:09:52,800
- Grace!
- No!

1492
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:54,300
- Grace!
- No!

1493
02:09:54,600 --> 02:09:55,900
Grace!

1494
02:10:02,100 --> 02:10:03,500
Grace!

1495
02:10:05,300 --> 02:10:06,500
Grace...

1496
02:10:08,100 --> 02:10:09,600
...go home.

1497
02:10:09,900 --> 02:10:11,200
Grace?

1498
02:10:12,400 --> 02:10:15,200
Grace! No! Grace!

1499
02:10:15,400 --> 02:10:17,400
- Grace!
- Grace!

1500
02:10:18,200 --> 02:10:19,600
Grace!

1501
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:00,900
You promised!

1502
02:12:12,400 --> 02:12:16,100
<i>For the last time, I heard a voice
that wasn't my mother's...</i>

1503
02:12:16,300 --> 02:12:18,700
<i>...whispering,
"Good morning, Columbus."</i>

1504
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:20,600
<i>And it didn't bother me.</i>

1505
02:12:21,400 --> 02:12:22,800
<i>And finally...</i>

1506
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:27,700
<i>...the voice became lower and turned into a wind
that sent the peaceful smell of cheap cologne.</i>

1507
02:12:27,700 --> 02:12:29,800
<i>And for the first time in my life...</i>

1508
02:12:30,100 --> 02:12:34,500
...I realized, like Columbus, I had
to live in a world of cheap cologne.

1509
02:12:34,900 --> 02:12:38,600
<i>And I wasn't sure any discovery
in America was possible anymore.</i>

1510
02:12:40,100 --> 02:12:43,000
<i>Smoothing roads and counting fish
wasn't science...</i>

1511
02:12:43,300 --> 02:12:45,600
<i>...but somehow
it prepared me for the ocean.</i>

1512
02:12:46,700 --> 02:12:51,100
<i>I don't know why, but... my father's
words jumped back into my head.</i>

1513
02:12:51,500 --> 02:12:53,800
<i>You know that work was like
a hat that you put on your head...</i>

1514
02:12:54,100 --> 02:12:58,400
<i>...and even if you didn't have pants, you didn't have
to walk down the street being ashamed of your ass...</i>

1515
02:12:58,400 --> 02:13:00,500
<i>...because you had a hat.</i>

1516
02:13:01,300 --> 02:13:04,200
<i>And even though my uncle Leo
worked for everything he got...</i>

1517
02:13:05,300 --> 02:13:07,700
<i>...I'm not sure he got
anything he needed.</i>

1518
02:13:08,900 --> 02:13:13,300
<i>Elaine and Grace were really one person
who were too big to share life in one body...</i>

1519
02:13:14,100 --> 02:13:16,600
<i>...no matter how much they loved
or hated each other.</i>

1520
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:22,400
<i>After the storm,
I couldn't say life was beautiful...</i>

1521
02:13:22,800 --> 02:13:26,000
<i>...but all I kept hoping for
was the Eskimo boy in my dream...</i>

1522
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,900
<i>...to run out of one of
these doors and hug me.</i>

1523
02:13:29,900 --> 02:13:32,500
<i>Even though I no longer
felt like a fish...</i>

1524
02:13:33,100 --> 02:13:35,300
<i>...and realized I knew nothing...</i>

1525
02:13:36,300 --> 02:13:38,600
<i>...I was happy to be alive.</i>

1526
02:16:37,400 --> 02:16:54,000

<i>A howling wind is whistling
in the night...</i>

1528
02:16:58,500 --> 02:17:01,800
<i>My dog is growling in the dark...</i>

1529
02:17:02,200 --> 02:17:05,600
<i>Something's pulling me
outside...</i>

1530
02:17:05,800 --> 02:17:08,800
<i>To ride around in circles...</i>

1531
02:17:09,600 --> 02:17:13,100
<i>I know you have
got the time...</i>

1532
02:17:13,300 --> 02:17:16,600
<i>Coz anything I want, you do...</i>

1533
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:20,100
<i>You'll take a ride
through the strangers...</i>

1534
02:17:20,300 --> 02:17:23,500
<i>Who don't understand
how to feel...</i>

1535
02:17:24,100 --> 02:17:28,100
<i>In the deathcar, we're alive...</i>

1536
02:17:31,600 --> 02:17:34,300
<i>In the deathcar...</i>

1537
02:17:37,200 --> 02:17:40,900
<i>We're alive...</i>

1538
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:06,800
<i>I'll let some air come
in the window...</i>

1539
02:18:07,200 --> 02:18:10,500
<i>Kind of wakes me up a little...</i>

1540
02:18:10,700 --> 02:18:13,700
<i>I don't turn on the radio...</i>

1541
02:18:13,900 --> 02:18:17,500
<i>Coz they play shit, like...
You know...</i>

1543
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,700
<i>It felt quite amazing...</i>

1544
02:18:25,500 --> 02:18:28,300
<i>And now that,
that is all over...</i>

1545
02:18:29,100 --> 02:18:32,300
<i>All we've got is the silence...</i>

1546
02:18:32,800 --> 02:18:36,700
<i>In the deathcar, we're alive...</i>

1547
02:18:40,100 --> 02:18:42,700
<i>In the deathcar...</i>

1548
02:18:45,700 --> 02:18:49,300
<i>We're alive...</i>

1549
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:56,400
<i>Come on mandolins, play...
