1
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,502
"Good morning, Columbus."

2
00:06:38,462 --> 00:06:42,215
My mother's eternal words, reminding
me America was already discovered,

3
00:06:42,632 --> 00:06:45,969
and that day-dreaming
was a long way from life's truths.

4
00:06:46,428 --> 00:06:50,181
Why tell me the difference
between an apple and a bicycle?

5
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,018
If I bite a bicycle and ride an apple,
I'll know the difference.

6
00:06:54,643 --> 00:06:58,272
But thinking about what to do made me
more tired than actually doing.

7
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:02,275
I remember my father said:
If you want to look at someone's soul,

8
00:07:02,734 --> 00:07:04,611
you have to look at their dreams.

9
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,239
Then you'd have mercy for those
who swim in bigger shit than your own.

10
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:13,160
My name is Axel Blackmar, and I work
for the Department of Fish and Game.

11
00:07:13,619 --> 00:07:17,164
Most people think I count fish,
but I don't.

12
00:07:17,623 --> 00:07:21,626
I look at their souls, their dreams
and then I let them into my dreams.

13
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:26,506
People think fish are stupid, but they
aren't. They know when to be quiet.

14
00:07:26,965 --> 00:07:31,135
It's people that are stupid. Fish know
everything, and don't need to think.

15
00:07:32,261 --> 00:07:36,390
See, fish start out in small streams,
then I prepare them for the ocean.

16
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:39,977
When they're ready to die,
they return to where they came from.

17
00:07:40,435 --> 00:07:44,189
That's my connection,
that's why I swam away to the city.

18
00:07:44,647 --> 00:07:46,483
Okay, here's my job:

19
00:07:46,941 --> 00:07:48,985
All I do
is temporarily electrocute the fish,

20
00:07:49,444 --> 00:07:53,280
then with deep respect, I scoop 'em
and haul 'em in, one by one...

21
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:57,493
Sometimes I'll look into fish eyes
and I'll see my whole life.

22
00:07:57,993 --> 00:08:00,871
It's something only fish can show us,
and I love 'em for it.

23
00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:05,458
I tag the fish, measure 'em and weigh
'em, make sure they're doing okay.

24
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:10,713
If they want to talk, I always listen.
That's the job of a Fish God.

25
00:08:11,172 --> 00:08:13,215
I've never caught a fish in a lie,

26
00:08:13,674 --> 00:08:16,552
and I've never seen a fish
swim in the shit that human people do.

27
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:20,514
That's why I love my work,
and I love New York.

28
00:08:20,972 --> 00:08:25,101
Not because my mother said it was
a place with real magnetic pull,

29
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,980
but because you can see everybody,
and nobody can see you.

30
00:08:34,526 --> 00:08:37,863
Hey, honey! How are you?
How was Istanbul?

31
00:08:40,157 --> 00:08:44,869
I'm looking for my girlfriend, Suzanne
Supak. I just spoke with her. Over.

32
00:08:45,328 --> 00:08:47,455
I love you too, honey.

33
00:08:49,582 --> 00:08:53,586
I miss you too, honey. Over.
Two more, please!

34
00:08:54,586 --> 00:08:56,421
Pregnant? Wow! Over.

35
00:08:58,924 --> 00:08:59,883
Listen, honey...

36
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,469
Alright, let's go.
Have the abortion...

37
00:09:02,927 --> 00:09:05,597
I'm not going.
Come on! We're running late!

38
00:09:06,055 --> 00:09:08,015
I said I'm not going.

39
00:09:08,432 --> 00:09:13,229
You said you're not going?
I said I'm not going.

40
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,814
I'm not going.
You're not going?

41
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:19,151
Are you going to go or no?

42
00:09:20,944 --> 00:09:24,489
Are you gonna shoot me?
Am I? - You're going to kill me?

43
00:09:26,991 --> 00:09:30,202
These things. I don't even...
It's a blank.

44
00:09:30,619 --> 00:09:33,455
But I had you scared, right?

45
00:09:34,581 --> 00:09:37,793
Let me feel.
You shit your pants.

46
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,677
"Take care of me"...
I'm fuckin' sick of it!

47
00:09:48,427 --> 00:09:49,470
What?

48
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:53,432
He's your uncle, for Chrissakes.

49
00:09:54,266 --> 00:09:58,395
If he wants to see me,
why did he send you?

50
00:09:59,271 --> 00:10:01,439
You know it wasn't his fault, right?

51
00:10:01,856 --> 00:10:05,693
I don't blame him for anything, Paul.
I never said it was his fault.

52
00:10:06,152 --> 00:10:08,988
He's marrying,
and wants you as his best man.

53
00:10:09,447 --> 00:10:14,618
You be his best man. - Why are you
like that? You're killing him!

54
00:10:18,747 --> 00:10:20,832
Alright, Axel! Axel, listen.

55
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,543
End of story! Over!

56
00:10:26,295 --> 00:10:28,506
I love you too!

57
00:10:28,964 --> 00:10:33,010
I'm going to go back
and tell him I couldn't find you.

58
00:10:33,469 --> 00:10:35,596
Really?
Really. I have no choice.

59
00:10:36,013 --> 00:10:40,058
Promise? - I promise.
What about a hug? No hug for me?

60
00:10:41,267 --> 00:10:44,020
Axel, you smell like a scumbag!

61
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:48,607
I'm a happy scumbag. I got a nice
truck, a great job. - But you smell.

62
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:52,486
What're you gonna have?
Two beers. - Two beers, OK.

63
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:54,947
And a ginger ale.
Two beers and...

64
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,949
Forget the ginger ale.
Two beers and two shots. - Blanche?

65
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,160
Two...
Who's the boss?

66
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:03,830
I am. - He is. 2 beers, 2 shots.
And a ginger ale.

67
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,706
2 beers, 2 shots.

68
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,793
And a ginger ale. - Don't confuse her.
A ginger ale please?

69
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,297
Anyway, Axel, I love you, but...

70
00:11:13,755 --> 00:11:16,883
What? I love you too.
Okay, well, you know... ginger ale.

71
00:11:17,717 --> 00:11:21,930
That's right. 2 beers and 2 shots.
And a ginger ale.

72
00:11:22,388 --> 00:11:25,600
"2 beers and 2 shots." What's that?
What? - That thing...

73
00:11:26,058 --> 00:11:27,977
What thing?
Like a funny accent or something.

74
00:11:28,436 --> 00:11:31,855
What funny accent thing?
"2 beers and 2 shots." - What?

75
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:34,691
I dunno... like New York.

76
00:11:35,776 --> 00:11:38,737
Funny New York accent, huh?
Yeah.

77
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,825
Is De Niro funny? Is Pacino funny?
Is Rocky funny?

78
00:11:44,617 --> 00:11:47,536
The great actors are all
from New York. - Sinatra?

79
00:11:47,995 --> 00:11:51,165
Sinatra's from Hoboken, New Jersey.
Now let's toast.

80
00:11:52,207 --> 00:11:55,377
Alright? It's been three years, OK?
Three years.

81
00:11:56,044 --> 00:11:59,130
To three years.
Three years.

82
00:12:03,092 --> 00:12:05,136
Blanche, ginger ale.

83
00:12:07,972 --> 00:12:09,306
Two shots.

84
00:12:09,723 --> 00:12:12,809
We don't see each other 3 years,
and you want ginger ale.

85
00:12:13,268 --> 00:12:17,272
Thank you, Blanche. - Thanks for the
ginger ale. - You're welcome, boys.

86
00:12:26,697 --> 00:12:29,074
Gimme a hug.
I'll plug my nose.

87
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,662
Back to the dream.

88
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:38,583
The man gives the stomach balloon
to the little boy.

89
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,461
Pushes him out of the igloo.

90
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:45,965
While the kid is outside,
the two inside start, y'know...

91
00:12:47,132 --> 00:12:50,469
Alright! Stop yelling,
we're on Broadway. Show respect.

92
00:14:45,991 --> 00:14:50,162
Therefore, I know you're all
dying for a piece of wedding cake...

93
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,040
So I will make this short and sweet.

94
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:57,377
Millie,

95
00:14:57,794 --> 00:14:59,295
dear friends,

96
00:14:59,712 --> 00:15:03,799
waiters and waitresses, I'd like to
propose this wedding toast...

97
00:15:04,258 --> 00:15:07,052
Leo!
Not now, Millie.

98
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,599
Come on!

99
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:17,645
Hey! Don't fuck around!

100
00:15:18,312 --> 00:15:22,191
Cut it out!
Don't be a jerk! Cut it out!

101
00:15:24,818 --> 00:15:28,655
I got an audition coming up!
You're lucky I don't kick your ass...

102
00:15:29,364 --> 00:15:30,699
Cut it out! Axel!

103
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,952
You want me to come down?
Come on down!

104
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,829
Stop shaking the ladder!
Axel!

105
00:15:37,288 --> 00:15:38,414
I'm coming down!
Leo!

106
00:15:38,873 --> 00:15:40,791
My boy!
Axel!

107
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,626
I can't believe it!

108
00:15:48,173 --> 00:15:50,175
You got big on me!

109
00:15:50,592 --> 00:15:53,386
You heard about the wedding?
I did. Congratulations.

110
00:15:53,845 --> 00:15:58,266
I'd be proud if you'd be my best man.
I gotta get back to New York.

111
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:02,686
Sure... Larry, we have to make
Axel an appointment for a fitting.

112
00:16:03,103 --> 00:16:05,105
Honestly, Leo, I've got to go.

113
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:08,608
It's so good to see you, Axel.
You look terrific, Axel.

114
00:16:09,025 --> 00:16:12,028
I just want to show you something.
I want to share this with you.

115
00:16:12,487 --> 00:16:14,948
What do you think about my Saguro?

116
00:16:15,406 --> 00:16:17,366
The cactus?
Nice, huh?

117
00:16:17,783 --> 00:16:19,910
Let me let you in on a secret:

118
00:16:20,369 --> 00:16:24,373
When a cactus is that young,
it is very vulnerable. That's why

119
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,793
I planted that Mesquite tree
right next to it, for protection.

120
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:32,464
If you don't see an older tree nearby
a new cactus, you can forget it.

121
00:16:32,922 --> 00:16:34,382
It ain't gonna make it.

122
00:16:34,841 --> 00:16:38,177
Come on inside.
Somebody's dyin' to meet you.

123
00:16:39,845 --> 00:16:43,223
Millie! I'd like you to meet
my nephew Axel.

124
00:16:43,682 --> 00:16:45,684
Axel, this is Millie.

125
00:16:47,811 --> 00:16:49,020
How do you do?

126
00:16:54,692 --> 00:16:57,570
Aren't you overdoing it just a little,
Millie? - Oh, sorry.

127
00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:00,322
Come on, sit down next to me, Axel.

128
00:17:02,825 --> 00:17:05,577
Lemme get a pair of pants on first...

129
00:17:11,124 --> 00:17:14,836
Stop singing!
I'm not singing. I count!

130
00:17:15,294 --> 00:17:16,921
Count the stitches!

131
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:21,342
You've been on that jacket
for a week. Finish it!

132
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,927
Bye bye anybody...

133
00:17:35,146 --> 00:17:38,899
Sorry for interrupting
you two, but I had to get my pants on.

134
00:17:40,734 --> 00:17:44,029
Leo's told me so much about you.

135
00:17:45,489 --> 00:17:48,325
I guess you know
I'm gonna be your new aunt.

136
00:17:50,952 --> 00:17:54,414
You're his... fianc�e.

137
00:17:54,872 --> 00:17:56,082
Yeah.

138
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,672
You don't have to call me Aunt Mille,
though. Unless you want to.

139
00:18:07,634 --> 00:18:10,261
How old are you?
Twenty three.

140
00:18:14,932 --> 00:18:16,392
We're almost the same age...

141
00:18:17,852 --> 00:18:19,728
Isn't that funny?

142
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:27,277
Millie, please.
Remember we talked about this?

143
00:18:28,945 --> 00:18:32,573
I'm sorry, Leo. Just a second.

144
00:18:35,493 --> 00:18:38,078
Leo's trying to teach me
how to stop crying.

145
00:18:38,496 --> 00:18:44,835
Sweetheart, go in the other room
and try on the other dress for Axel.

146
00:18:48,129 --> 00:18:49,798
That'll get your mind off...

147
00:18:50,256 --> 00:18:55,970
Go in the other room, sweetheart,
and try the other dress on.

148
00:18:56,429 --> 00:19:02,392
It'll take your mind off crying.
It's in the other room!

149
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,481
I'm going.
Do me the favor.

150
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:28,124
You know, Axel, my little Polish
cupcake is very sensitive...

151
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:31,044
...like the Eastern Europeans are.

152
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:35,172
But she's very nice, right?
Very nice, Leo.

153
00:19:36,048 --> 00:19:38,676
And you know how old she is?
She's young.

154
00:19:39,093 --> 00:19:40,928
Damn right. That's success.

155
00:19:41,386 --> 00:19:45,390
To achieve that success, you need
to sell cars. - I don't want to.

156
00:19:45,807 --> 00:19:51,687
Axel, my father had the first Cadillac
dealership in Arizona in 1914!

157
00:19:52,146 --> 00:19:55,399
He had this magnificent dream,
to sell as many cars as he could,

158
00:19:55,858 --> 00:19:59,945
and stack them up until they got high
enough so he could walk to the moon.

159
00:20:00,404 --> 00:20:04,741
Isn't it beautiful? - Very beautiful,
Leo. But they'd topple over.

160
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,786
That's what I said,
but he wanted me in the business,

161
00:20:08,203 --> 00:20:10,163
and I resisted,
like you're resisting me.

162
00:20:10,621 --> 00:20:13,624
I'm not resisting, Leo.
I just don't want to sell cars.

163
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:17,127
What the hell are you afraid of?
Nothing.

164
00:20:22,716 --> 00:20:23,967
One thing I was sure of,

165
00:20:24,426 --> 00:20:27,429
my uncle Leo was definitely
the hero of my childhood.

166
00:20:28,972 --> 00:20:34,060
The smell of his "Old Spice" carried
me back more than the home movies did.

167
00:20:35,352 --> 00:20:40,065
It was the sweet, cheap smell
of car dealers that took me back,

168
00:20:40,482 --> 00:20:42,901
and made me dissolve into the past.

169
00:20:43,985 --> 00:20:47,113
Leo was the last dinosaur
that smelled of cheap cologne.

170
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,283
And he believed in the American dream.

171
00:20:50,741 --> 00:20:53,369
I was crazy about him,
because he believed in miracles.

172
00:20:53,828 --> 00:20:56,997
Even though he lived inside
of life and sold Cadillacs,

173
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:01,752
he always looked like a 10-year-old
boy whose sleeves were too long.

174
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:04,296
Leo gave me this movie camera.

175
00:21:04,754 --> 00:21:07,590
My mother always hoped
I'd become the next Milton Berle.

176
00:21:08,007 --> 00:21:12,178
But dreams of houses, cars, and lawns
aren't dreams when they become real.

177
00:21:12,637 --> 00:21:17,224
I understood what my mother
meant by "Good morning, Columbus."

178
00:21:17,641 --> 00:21:22,270
Even if she didn't like what I was
doing, I think she'd understand me.

179
00:22:08,938 --> 00:22:13,025
When I was 11, I got this really weird
earache that wouldn't go away.

180
00:22:13,442 --> 00:22:16,195
A hundred doctors couldn't help me...

181
00:22:16,653 --> 00:22:18,864
So Leo went into Mexico,

182
00:22:19,281 --> 00:22:23,493
and brought back this fat lady
witch doctor who fixed me right up.

183
00:22:24,327 --> 00:22:27,538
I was grateful, but I thought
I might've been better off mute.

184
00:22:28,331 --> 00:22:30,708
All in all,
I had a very happy childhood.

185
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,671
My dad, a border guard, spent his life
trying to stop people crossing lines.

186
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:40,509
For 15 years, he'd smooth down
the road between Mexico and Arizona,

187
00:22:40,967 --> 00:22:44,345
and every morning he'd be out there
looking for footprints in the dirt.

188
00:22:44,804 --> 00:22:47,682
But my father always said that work
was like a hat you put on your head.

189
00:22:48,141 --> 00:22:52,895
And even without pants, you didn't
have to be ashamed of your ass.

190
00:22:54,396 --> 00:22:56,648
One thing I was sure about:

191
00:22:57,482 --> 00:23:00,861
The moment my parents died,
my childhood was gone forever.

192
00:23:02,862 --> 00:23:05,823
Leo could never shake the guilt
of my parents' death 6 years ago.

193
00:23:06,532 --> 00:23:09,035
Leo was driving the car that night.

194
00:23:09,493 --> 00:23:13,330
It got so bad that he even felt guilty
if he used too much shaving cream.

195
00:23:13,747 --> 00:23:17,459
Four days after the funeral,
I caught a train to New York City.

196
00:23:18,251 --> 00:23:22,630
If somebody asked me why I don't
take the next train back to New York,

197
00:23:23,089 --> 00:23:25,758
it's because you can't say no
to your childhood hero.

198
00:23:26,217 --> 00:23:29,303
I decided to be his best man,
but one thing I was sure of:

199
00:23:29,762 --> 00:23:32,139
No matter how much I loved
the smell of cheap cologne,

200
00:23:32,556 --> 00:23:37,019
I was never going to become my uncle,
and I would never sell Cadillacs.

201
00:23:43,024 --> 00:23:46,319
Axel, if I died tomorrow,
where would you be?

202
00:23:58,413 --> 00:24:00,373
You're not gonna die tomorrow.

203
00:24:00,832 --> 00:24:03,418
Who knows when I'll die?

204
00:24:03,835 --> 00:24:07,296
Your mother and father didn't.
That was an accident.

205
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:10,966
No, it was stupidity. I shouldn't
have been behind that wheel.

206
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,844
Please, no guilt. Please.

207
00:24:18,932 --> 00:24:19,891
Look,

208
00:24:20,308 --> 00:24:25,354
I'm not going to allow you
to become a bum in New York.

209
00:24:26,189 --> 00:24:30,526
I want you to stay here with me.
Try it for one week.

210
00:24:30,943 --> 00:24:34,112
If you don't like it,
then you go home.

211
00:24:34,571 --> 00:24:36,406
Okay?

212
00:24:49,835 --> 00:24:53,714
Axel, make "busy." Very, very busy.
Hello.

213
00:24:54,381 --> 00:24:57,217
Busy, but "willing to take time out
from your schedule," Axel.

214
00:25:04,098 --> 00:25:05,057
Hello.

215
00:25:07,101 --> 00:25:08,561
Axel, make "sexy."

216
00:25:16,776 --> 00:25:18,987
Try it with your lips,
pucker them up..."Hello."

217
00:25:21,781 --> 00:25:25,534
No,
more with the lips, you know, "Hello."

218
00:25:28,245 --> 00:25:31,498
Axel, I'm a gorgeous woman,
and I have big, beautiful breasts.

219
00:25:31,957 --> 00:25:33,584
Now do "sexy."

220
00:25:35,502 --> 00:25:37,963
No, Axel. Breasts.

221
00:25:54,436 --> 00:25:57,022
You're talking art,
you're talking gravity.

222
00:26:02,902 --> 00:26:07,364
You see this? - Yeah. Banana.
Proteins, proteins...

223
00:26:08,532 --> 00:26:11,285
Your organs
produce a certain amount of proteins.

224
00:26:11,702 --> 00:26:15,789
Well, when you see a beautiful woman,
you produce extra proteins.

225
00:26:16,248 --> 00:26:19,375
These extra proteins
go directly to your brain.

226
00:26:19,834 --> 00:26:22,962
Where do you get all this stuff?
Scientific fact.

227
00:26:23,379 --> 00:26:26,632
Anyway, I've figured out a way
to make it work for me.

228
00:26:27,091 --> 00:26:29,259
I call it "The Gaze."

229
00:26:29,718 --> 00:26:32,179
You look into a woman's eyes,
and you think exactly

230
00:26:32,638 --> 00:26:35,182
what you want her to do for you.

231
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:21,265
You're an actor?
Oh my God, he's an actor!

232
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:26,729
In 12 days, I have a gigantic
performance I'm doing in Tucson.

233
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,731
Maybe you'd like to come and see me?

234
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:35,570
It's an audition. - What have
we seen you in? Movies, TV shows?

235
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:40,241
Do you go to foreign films? - No.
I'm a major star in Europe.

236
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,076
Foreign films?

237
00:27:43,452 --> 00:27:45,121
Yeah, foreign films.

238
00:27:58,549 --> 00:28:00,343
Come here, close to me.

239
00:28:01,594 --> 00:28:03,387
Feel better now?

240
00:28:05,222 --> 00:28:07,016
Feel better now?

241
00:28:09,643 --> 00:28:12,145
You like that?
Don't touch my face, okay?

242
00:28:13,063 --> 00:28:15,940
Oh, come on!
No, I'm not kidding.

243
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,527
We can make love,
but don't touch my face or my hair.

244
00:28:19,986 --> 00:28:23,781
Are all actors like that?
All the great actors are.

245
00:28:25,324 --> 00:28:29,578
Do you think anybody touches
Brando's face? Or Pacino's?

246
00:28:30,037 --> 00:28:34,624
Do they touch De Niro's face?
Or fucking touch Johnny Depp's face?

247
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:39,253
No one's gonna touch
Paul Leger's face, okay?

248
00:28:46,593 --> 00:28:48,220
I'm missing my favorite scene...

249
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:52,182
I'm telling you, if I hear anything,
I swear I'm gonna kill somebody...

250
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:55,268
Go ahead and kill everybody!
You're the tough guy!

251
00:28:55,685 --> 00:28:57,228
Kill Vicky, kill Salvy,

252
00:28:57,645 --> 00:28:59,605
Tommy Como, and me while you're at it!

253
00:29:00,064 --> 00:29:03,484
You're killing yourself,
the way you eat, you fat fuck!

254
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:06,111
What do you mean "kill you"?

255
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,529
Me, kill me!

256
00:29:07,988 --> 00:29:11,950
Start here! Do me a fuckin' favor!
You meant something.

257
00:29:12,492 --> 00:29:16,371
You mentioned Tommy, Salvy,
and you included you with them.

258
00:29:16,871 --> 00:29:19,582
You could have said anybody,
but you said you and them.

259
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,377
You've let this girl ruin your life.

260
00:29:23,794 --> 00:29:25,629
She really did some job on you!

261
00:29:26,088 --> 00:29:29,299
Look what she did to you!
You fucked my wife.

262
00:29:29,716 --> 00:29:30,967
You fucked my wife?

263
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,098
I'm not going to answer.
It's a sick question.

264
00:29:38,015 --> 00:29:39,850
I'm gonna leave.

265
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:41,477
Very nice!

266
00:29:41,936 --> 00:29:45,606
You won't have troubles in your bed,
so don't pick it out on me!

267
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:08,335
Pig, pig, pig! Here!

268
00:30:33,107 --> 00:30:35,526
Hello.
Hello there.

269
00:30:36,527 --> 00:30:38,904
Adrian Del Monica.
How do you do?

270
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:47,829
I'm not seein' it.
It's right in front of you!

271
00:30:48,288 --> 00:30:53,501
Yeah, but the vibe...
It's all wrong.

272
00:30:58,422 --> 00:31:03,844
Mine is a '66, and it's old!
I need a new one!

273
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,973
I'm not giving you any more.
500 dollars, that's it.

274
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:10,684
Are you listening to me?

275
00:31:11,142 --> 00:31:13,645
Don't even think about this, Mother!

276
00:31:14,103 --> 00:31:17,106
I can look if I want to.
Get out! You cannot pay for this.

277
00:31:17,565 --> 00:31:20,734
Yes I can!
No you can't, Mother!

278
00:31:21,151 --> 00:31:24,446
We made a deal, 500 dollars.
I don't know, well...

279
00:31:24,905 --> 00:31:27,491
How are you going to pay for this?
With your money.

280
00:31:27,908 --> 00:31:29,909
Which is half mine.
You know what, Mother?

281
00:31:30,368 --> 00:31:33,454
Fuck you! - Hello, Axel Blackmar.
Fuck you, too!

282
00:31:33,871 --> 00:31:39,084
What a beautiful dress. - I didn't
come here for cheap compliments.

283
00:31:39,543 --> 00:31:42,963
I wasn't complimenting you. Sorry.
Forgive me if I've offended you.

284
00:31:44,047 --> 00:31:48,551
I'm sorry.
You break, you pay! - No.

285
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,762
Something wrong with it?

286
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:57,435
Yeah, it's funny.
Thank you. That's very nice.

287
00:31:57,893 --> 00:32:01,855
Okay, right.
The undercoating looks pretty good.

288
00:32:02,815 --> 00:32:04,566
The suspension is funny.

289
00:32:04,983 --> 00:32:08,945
Look, the right wheel, see?
It's lower than the left. - It is.

290
00:32:09,404 --> 00:32:10,613
It's true.

291
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:14,784
I didn't mean to insult. I just wanted
to tell you how beautiful you look.

292
00:32:15,243 --> 00:32:18,162
Are you going to sell me a car or not?
Yes.

293
00:32:18,621 --> 00:32:20,289
Hello, Elaine.
Hi!

294
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:23,000
I didn't know you worked here.
Temporary.

295
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:26,336
Can you hold on a sec?
I'll be right with you.

296
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:30,465
Keep the daughter busy.
No. She's my first customer.

297
00:32:30,924 --> 00:32:33,593
The woman knows my face.
It's better for the sale.

298
00:32:34,051 --> 00:32:37,638
It's better if I do it!
Don't ever touch my suit.

299
00:32:38,097 --> 00:32:41,016
Do me a favor,
keep the daughter busy.

300
00:32:42,267 --> 00:32:45,062
Elaine, do you want to step outside?
Sure.

301
00:32:46,688 --> 00:32:49,732
Why's he looking at me like that?
Oh, he's a kid. He's...

302
00:32:59,825 --> 00:33:01,702
You ever think about suicide?

303
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,371
Excuse me?
Suicide.

304
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:07,040
Not recently.

305
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:11,919
I think about it all the time.
I want to come back as a turtle.

306
00:33:12,795 --> 00:33:15,506
Turtles are very nice.
Yes, they're the best.

307
00:33:17,258 --> 00:33:22,596
She's not my real mother.
She married my father. He's dead.

308
00:33:24,181 --> 00:33:27,809
Both my parents are dead.
You sure become your parents.

309
00:33:28,268 --> 00:33:32,522
Even if they're not your real parents.
I'm gonna kill myself before that.

310
00:33:32,939 --> 00:33:36,609
Really? - Yup.
Do you think you're overreacting?

311
00:33:41,405 --> 00:33:43,365
I don't have another match.

312
00:33:44,366 --> 00:33:46,910
Look at my hands!
These aren't my hands.

313
00:33:47,368 --> 00:33:48,912
These are her hands.

314
00:33:50,413 --> 00:33:53,040
Do you like my legs?
I hate them!

315
00:33:54,041 --> 00:33:55,918
Sometimes I'll be sitting,

316
00:33:56,335 --> 00:33:59,254
and I'll look down,
and they're crossed just like hers.

317
00:33:59,713 --> 00:34:03,091
She does have nice legs.
Yes, she does.

318
00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:06,636
What's so bad
about becoming your mother?

319
00:34:07,053 --> 00:34:10,348
Just wait. One day you'll wake up,
and you'll be your father.

320
00:34:11,307 --> 00:34:14,435
Wrong. My uncle is my only family.
What does he do?

321
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:17,604
He owns this place.
See what I mean?

322
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:22,234
My father owned the 3rd largest
copper mine in Arizona.

323
00:34:22,651 --> 00:34:25,779
Now I own the 3rd largest
copper mine in Arizona.

324
00:34:26,237 --> 00:34:29,407
You're an idiot if you think
you can escape it.

325
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:31,868
Don't call me an idiot.

326
00:34:35,371 --> 00:34:36,872
Look, man...

327
00:34:37,289 --> 00:34:39,041
I gave you pazzazz,

328
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,960
I offered you excitement,
vibes,

329
00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:44,129
sexy good-looking,

330
00:34:44,588 --> 00:34:49,384
I even gave you Waaaaaagaaanganngg!
What else could you want in a car?

331
00:34:49,842 --> 00:34:52,345
Good gas mileage. That's important.

332
00:34:53,137 --> 00:34:55,306
Mr. Del Monica, look at my lips.

333
00:34:56,015 --> 00:34:57,558
They're gonna say:

334
00:34:57,975 --> 00:35:03,104
Take your whsshht and get off my lot,
before I punch you!

335
00:35:03,563 --> 00:35:04,731
Now git!

336
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:07,233
Are you sore?
Out! Out!

337
00:35:14,657 --> 00:35:16,825
Buy a Ford!

338
00:35:18,118 --> 00:35:20,746
It's disgusting.
Isn't it disgusting?

339
00:35:21,371 --> 00:35:23,540
Goodbye, chickenhead.
Axel.

340
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:27,627
Hey Elaine, I was wondering...
I know we just met,

341
00:35:28,044 --> 00:35:33,591
but I was wondering if the two of us
could meet for a picnic or a soir�e?

342
00:35:34,008 --> 00:35:36,760
I don't think so.
Goodbye, Paul.

343
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:47,061
What the fuck was that? - What?
I was waiting for that woman.

344
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,773
Why was the door locked?
She was making a phone call.

345
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,274
Really?

346
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:55,361
Gentlemen, new showroom policy:
As of today,

347
00:35:55,819 --> 00:35:58,780
if any customers
come in dressed casually,

348
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:03,326
they're yours. Starting now.
Clear the area.

349
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:15,921
Did you know
that the warriors in Papua New Guinea

350
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,757
avoid eating turtle meat before battle?

351
00:36:19,216 --> 00:36:21,927
They believe
that turtles are very shy,

352
00:36:22,385 --> 00:36:24,053
and if they eat the meat,

353
00:36:24,512 --> 00:36:27,390
their enemies will become shy,
and run away.

354
00:36:28,641 --> 00:36:31,977
Did you know that?
Well, it is fascinating.

355
00:36:32,436 --> 00:36:36,982
A Papua New Guinea story!
It's "Papua." - I don't give a shit!

356
00:36:37,399 --> 00:36:43,571
Wait! Isn't that the place where the
village boys go into the woods,

357
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:50,619
and they build a giant lean-to...
a shack. - That's right!

358
00:36:51,036 --> 00:36:54,456
Then they take a woman
they've captured from another village,

359
00:36:54,915 --> 00:36:56,542
and they put her inside the lean-to.

360
00:36:56,959 --> 00:37:01,588
And then every boy in the village
goes in to lose his virginity.

361
00:37:02,005 --> 00:37:07,301
When the last boy in line is inside,
the rest go to the shack and knock...

362
00:37:07,718 --> 00:37:09,470
You know the rest?
Yes.

363
00:37:09,929 --> 00:37:11,847
Why do they knock it down?

364
00:37:12,306 --> 00:37:16,810
Because they eat the poor bastard
who was last, and the girl.

365
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:20,146
Nice.
But they're natives. Natives.

366
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:25,526
Oops! I've lost my napkin!

367
00:38:12,486 --> 00:38:15,781
There's plenty of room here.
Why don't you move apart?

368
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:17,908
We're fine.

369
00:38:18,366 --> 00:38:19,784
Grace!

370
00:38:22,162 --> 00:38:25,915
Axel, tell them the Eskimo movie
dream thing. - Why don't you, Paul?

371
00:38:26,374 --> 00:38:28,209
Well, I'd love to hear it!

372
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:31,045
Oh yes!
My mother loves bed-time stories.

373
00:38:31,712 --> 00:38:32,921
Go on, Axel.

374
00:38:34,965 --> 00:38:37,509
This Eskimo, Dooey, is fishing...

375
00:38:38,468 --> 00:38:42,180
through a hole in the ice,
and he catches this fish

376
00:38:42,597 --> 00:38:46,225
with both eyes on the same side
of its head. - I'm sorry.

377
00:38:46,684 --> 00:38:50,646
But is that a real fish?
Yes, it's a real fish.

378
00:38:51,105 --> 00:38:53,273
And there's a storm coming,

379
00:38:53,732 --> 00:38:57,986
so Dooey gets on his dog sled,
and travels through the ice.

380
00:38:58,445 --> 00:38:59,571
Stop!

381
00:38:59,988 --> 00:39:01,948
Grow up! Mother, now!
Mind your own business!

382
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:05,910
...he builds a fire,
and the snow from the tree falls down

383
00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:08,496
and puts the fire out.
Jesus.

384
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:10,831
Sweetheart, go play.

385
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:13,917
Is that it?
No. So now Dooey is dying,

386
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:19,047
and his dog hypnotizes him,

387
00:39:19,464 --> 00:39:21,674
and brings him back to the igloo,

388
00:39:22,133 --> 00:39:24,051
where his wife rubs

389
00:39:24,468 --> 00:39:28,597
his body with a sponge,
and brings him back to life.

390
00:39:32,726 --> 00:39:33,685
That's beautiful.

391
00:39:34,603 --> 00:39:35,812
It is beautiful.

392
00:39:48,365 --> 00:39:52,744
What was that?
My hand slipped. - A kid.

393
00:39:53,453 --> 00:39:55,247
A kid. Beautiful.

394
00:40:05,214 --> 00:40:08,217
It must give you great pleasure
to be the life of the party, Mother.

395
00:40:08,676 --> 00:40:09,760
What party?

396
00:40:10,219 --> 00:40:12,721
Why must you try to screw

397
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,056
every man you see under 30?
Grace,

398
00:40:15,473 --> 00:40:18,101
in Papua New Guinea, it's
considered a right of passage...

399
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,895
I don't want to hear it!

400
00:40:22,563 --> 00:40:25,566
In Papua New Guinea,
if a woman wants to go to bed

401
00:40:25,983 --> 00:40:28,444
with a young man, she can.
Stop it!

402
00:40:28,861 --> 00:40:30,404
If she's older, it's okay!

403
00:40:30,821 --> 00:40:35,367
If you fucking say it one more time,
I'm going to smash this table now!

404
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,413
Let go!

405
00:41:06,812 --> 00:41:09,648
Paul, maybe we should go...
Sit down! - Go!

406
00:41:10,065 --> 00:41:11,441
Sit.
Go!

407
00:41:11,983 --> 00:41:15,445
No! You're not invited! Go!
Sit!

408
00:41:15,904 --> 00:41:19,115
I think we should stay here tonight.
No! You're not invited!

409
00:41:19,574 --> 00:41:21,492
My friends can stay if they want.

410
00:41:21,951 --> 00:41:25,829
You are disgusting. An immature girl
in a sagging, old body!

411
00:41:26,288 --> 00:41:30,250
You're a pale imitation of a young me.
Except I didn't kill my husband!

412
00:41:30,667 --> 00:41:32,586
Tell your fucking new friends

413
00:41:33,044 --> 00:41:36,256
what that's like! - Shut up!
No, you go ahead!

414
00:41:36,714 --> 00:41:37,757
Shut up, Grace!

415
00:41:38,174 --> 00:41:43,262
You're disgusting! - Shut up!
No, 'cuz I said it!

416
00:41:44,555 --> 00:41:48,100
If it hadn't been for you,
he'd still be alive!

417
00:41:49,434 --> 00:41:50,394
Fuck.

418
00:41:56,691 --> 00:42:00,736
That's it.
I'm gonna kill myself right now.

419
00:42:01,195 --> 00:42:02,905
Okay, good.

420
00:42:05,491 --> 00:42:08,744
Go ahead!
I'll give you a nice funeral.

421
00:42:10,954 --> 00:42:16,376
I'm sure you will. But you're
not getting any of my money!

422
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:19,629
I don't care. What else is new?

423
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:22,673
Look, Mom! See?

424
00:42:23,424 --> 00:42:24,925
She's taking down her panty hose.

425
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:29,721
I'm so glad I'll be dead for your
birthday! - Your best present ever!

426
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,807
This is it, Mom! Goodbye!

427
00:42:39,647 --> 00:42:40,815
Get away!

428
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:46,028
Look, Mom!

429
00:42:46,487 --> 00:42:48,697
She has her panties around her neck!

430
00:42:49,448 --> 00:42:50,407
I'm eating!

431
00:42:50,866 --> 00:42:53,243
You're desperate and sick, Mom.

432
00:42:53,702 --> 00:42:58,372
You're sick. I can't live this way.
I don't want to live this way.

433
00:42:58,831 --> 00:43:02,293
Why don't you have some dignity?
I'm not living this way.

434
00:43:03,711 --> 00:43:06,004
What do you want me to do?
No, this is good.

435
00:43:06,463 --> 00:43:09,674
What did you do that for?
I didn't bite him!

436
00:43:10,467 --> 00:43:13,803
Mom! - You didn't have to hit me,
did you? Is my nose bleeding?

437
00:43:14,888 --> 00:43:16,139
Grace, please don't.

438
00:43:16,597 --> 00:43:19,267
Why aren't you looking, Mom?

439
00:43:19,684 --> 00:43:21,394
I'm a failure!

440
00:43:22,103 --> 00:43:25,647
I won't live this way.
I've been incorrigible.

441
00:43:26,106 --> 00:43:28,984
Mom, you made me do this.
Stop this!

442
00:43:29,943 --> 00:43:33,154
Fuck yourself!
Paul! Shut up! ...cowardly lion.

443
00:43:34,822 --> 00:43:36,366
Grace, I'll never say it again.

444
00:43:36,824 --> 00:43:39,869
Liar!
No! I promise!

445
00:43:40,286 --> 00:43:42,037
You promise what?
Never to say "Papua..."

446
00:43:42,496 --> 00:43:44,498
You're so evil, Mother!

447
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,104
It's okay...

448
00:44:11,189 --> 00:44:13,274
I'll fight you standing on one foot,

449
00:44:13,775 --> 00:44:15,485
I'll fight you with my eyes closed!

450
00:44:17,028 --> 00:44:18,154
Elaine!

451
00:44:21,657 --> 00:44:24,701
You know when you're
just about to go to sleep,

452
00:44:25,118 --> 00:44:28,497
or you're just sort of,
you know, falling asleep...

453
00:44:28,955 --> 00:44:32,459
and you think you're really falling,
so you catch yourself?

454
00:44:33,585 --> 00:44:38,339
That ever happen to you? You're
not falling, just falling asleep.

455
00:44:38,756 --> 00:44:39,882
There you go.

456
00:44:42,259 --> 00:44:44,678
When I was a little girl,

457
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:47,889
I always wanted to fly.

458
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,475
From the top of the house.

459
00:44:52,435 --> 00:44:54,395
At night, I'd close my eyes,

460
00:44:55,188 --> 00:44:58,024
and imagine I was on the roof,

461
00:44:58,441 --> 00:45:01,694
looking down at my parents
in their bed.

462
00:45:02,861 --> 00:45:04,696
And then I'd jump off...

463
00:45:05,989 --> 00:45:07,699
and I'd fly...

464
00:45:10,201 --> 00:45:12,662
While everyone was sleeping,

465
00:45:13,454 --> 00:45:16,541
I'd be soaring around,

466
00:45:20,419 --> 00:45:22,671
looking through their windows,

467
00:45:24,131 --> 00:45:25,465
flying...

468
00:45:29,302 --> 00:45:31,679
and resting in the trees.

469
00:45:34,265 --> 00:45:36,559
I always knew I could,

470
00:45:37,852 --> 00:45:40,145
but I never told them.

471
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:45,901
Once someone knows,
they can make you fall.

472
00:45:55,076 --> 00:45:57,828
After I'm big,
I may start acting weird,

473
00:45:58,287 --> 00:46:01,040
stop returning calls,
dressing all in black,

474
00:46:01,498 --> 00:46:03,375
fancy restaurants, the whole shtick.

475
00:46:03,792 --> 00:46:05,752
I want you to keep me in perspective.

476
00:46:06,211 --> 00:46:10,131
Paul, you already wear black.
You know what I mean.

477
00:46:10,798 --> 00:46:13,509
I just can't
become a slave to my success.

478
00:46:13,968 --> 00:46:17,972
I have to stay myself.
I think she likes me.

479
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:21,725
Did you see how she looked in my eyes?
The great Paul Leger!

480
00:46:22,184 --> 00:46:25,145
I started thinking
about Paul's garbage theory, about

481
00:46:25,562 --> 00:46:28,356
male organs making extra proteins
when a beautiful woman looks at you.

482
00:46:29,274 --> 00:46:31,901
And if she keeps on looking,
they produce

483
00:46:32,318 --> 00:46:36,781
an extra protein, so deadly
that one drop on the tip of an arrow

484
00:46:37,198 --> 00:46:40,409
could kill
a fucking rhino in 2 seconds.

485
00:46:41,452 --> 00:46:44,246
I started to think
what I wanted her to think,

486
00:46:44,996 --> 00:46:46,748
I looked in her eyes,

487
00:46:47,791 --> 00:46:48,958
and bingo!

488
00:46:53,254 --> 00:46:55,131
She was mine.

489
00:46:56,465 --> 00:46:59,218
Paul swears that
cavemen used this deadly technique,

490
00:46:59,677 --> 00:47:03,680
and that the deadly male protein
killed the dinosaurs, not the ice age.

491
00:47:04,139 --> 00:47:07,350
I think he saw it in a movie,
and convinced himself it was true.

492
00:47:07,809 --> 00:47:09,894
That's how Paul escaped.

493
00:47:10,311 --> 00:47:13,105
And that's just what he did
the next day.

494
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:15,941
I never paid much attention
to Paul's garbage theories.

495
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,694
But then I realized he was right.

496
00:47:19,111 --> 00:47:23,323
I felt the proteins running through
my body like broken glass.

497
00:47:23,782 --> 00:47:27,994
I tried to keep the proteins busy
by making flying machines.

498
00:47:28,453 --> 00:47:31,372
I've never built
a flying machine before.

499
00:47:31,789 --> 00:47:34,834
The proteins
were making things fly in my head.

500
00:47:35,292 --> 00:47:38,879
The more I worked on it,
the more I was sure it would fly.

501
00:47:39,338 --> 00:47:43,091
I just kept telling myself:
It's gonna fly.

502
00:47:44,968 --> 00:47:47,512
Love hit me like an elephant,

503
00:47:47,971 --> 00:47:51,057
and I was thrown
into a jungle of dreams.

504
00:47:51,516 --> 00:47:55,269
Mother was wrong about magnetic pulls.
There was only one pull,

505
00:47:55,728 --> 00:47:57,521
and she was lying on my back.

506
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,109
I wasn't "falling in love,"
because I never felt any weight,

507
00:48:02,734 --> 00:48:06,488
because I was "flying in love,"
for the first time in my life.

508
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:03,582
Beautiful morning out, isn't it?

509
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:05,917
Yes, it is.

510
00:49:09,128 --> 00:49:11,172
Sit down. I'll do this.

511
00:49:15,676 --> 00:49:17,803
Cereal? - Huh?
Cereal?

512
00:49:18,887 --> 00:49:20,180
Sure.

513
00:49:30,982 --> 00:49:34,526
I made some coffee for you.
Great, thanks.

514
00:49:34,944 --> 00:49:37,279
Did you fuck her?

515
00:49:37,696 --> 00:49:39,573
What?

516
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:44,202
My mother. Did you fuck her?

517
00:49:46,454 --> 00:49:47,413
No.

518
00:49:57,172 --> 00:50:01,092
You liar! I can smell her on you.

519
00:50:05,889 --> 00:50:08,808
You're not the first,
did you know that?

520
00:50:13,938 --> 00:50:15,898
Could I have some milk?

521
00:50:22,654 --> 00:50:26,491
She's had a lot of young ones
like you, eats you up like chocolates.

522
00:50:26,949 --> 00:50:31,245
Could I have a spoon?
When she finishes a whole box,

523
00:50:35,749 --> 00:50:39,878
she sticks her finger
down her throat, and it comes back up.

524
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:47,552
You must have done well in school.
Straight A's.

525
00:51:38,014 --> 00:51:40,475
Food!
Good!

526
00:51:41,643 --> 00:51:43,728
Food! Hungry!

527
00:51:44,187 --> 00:51:46,772
I'm kind of hungry.
Hungry!

528
00:51:50,025 --> 00:51:53,570
Very good.
Good... Thirsty? Yes.

529
00:52:42,907 --> 00:52:46,160
Two... one... go!

530
00:53:06,345 --> 00:53:07,596
Almost!

531
00:53:14,728 --> 00:53:18,648
You ever thought about leaving?
Only a million times.

532
00:53:20,108 --> 00:53:23,861
Why don't you?
Soon I'm going to Papua New Guinea.

533
00:53:26,364 --> 00:53:30,242
Ever thought about Alaska?
Why would I go there?

534
00:53:30,701 --> 00:53:33,161
It's very beautiful.

535
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:38,875
In my dream, y'know, the movie dream?
There was a place on the Bering Sea.

536
00:53:39,334 --> 00:53:42,545
It's completely flat, and really,
really quiet, y'know?

537
00:53:43,504 --> 00:53:47,550
Not even the wind whistling,
because there's nothing there.

538
00:53:48,008 --> 00:53:49,968
And then there's a boat,

539
00:53:51,094 --> 00:53:52,638
and then...

540
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:56,975
there's the Eskimos.
The Eskimos!

541
00:53:57,392 --> 00:54:02,897
The Eskimos push their old people out
on ice floes to die! - No!

542
00:54:03,314 --> 00:54:07,318
They don't do that! Elaine, I was
trying to tell you the other night.

543
00:54:07,776 --> 00:54:11,488
Eskimos believe that,
even though you die,

544
00:54:11,947 --> 00:54:13,657
you're never really

545
00:54:14,074 --> 00:54:15,492
dead.

546
00:54:16,368 --> 00:54:17,410
What then?

547
00:54:19,787 --> 00:54:21,497
You're... infinity.

548
00:54:22,498 --> 00:54:26,043
They believe that when
the physical suit of skin dies,

549
00:54:26,502 --> 00:54:29,963
it becomes part of the earth,
but your soul...

550
00:54:30,422 --> 00:54:33,216
keeps going, into other things...

551
00:54:33,633 --> 00:54:36,303
like trees...

552
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,305
or fish or rocks...

553
00:54:39,764 --> 00:54:43,643
or even other people, who actually
are at that point, you.

554
00:54:44,685 --> 00:54:46,562
And if you don't like what you became?

555
00:54:51,984 --> 00:54:52,943
Shit!

556
00:54:54,194 --> 00:54:57,030
You wait a few years,
and then you turn into something else.

557
00:54:57,489 --> 00:55:00,700
And love works the same way...

558
00:55:01,117 --> 00:55:05,121
So like, if you and I
went down in a plane crash,

559
00:55:05,579 --> 00:55:09,458
that would be okay,
because our souls would keep going.

560
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:13,587
And we'd love each other
over and over, from place to place,

561
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:16,798
because it's infinity.

562
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:21,552
And you want to go there with me?
Yeah.

563
00:55:23,512 --> 00:55:28,058
We would love each other
over and over, for infinity.

564
00:55:29,101 --> 00:55:30,060
Elaine,

565
00:55:31,019 --> 00:55:36,608
we'll go to the Bering Sea,
we'll be in love, and we'll never die.

566
00:55:37,025 --> 00:55:41,153
Never die. We can leave tomorrow,
or we can leave right now.

567
00:55:42,196 --> 00:55:43,614
Okay.

568
00:56:05,718 --> 00:56:10,180
I hope we're not disturbing.
What are you doing here, Leo?

569
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:13,350
Axel, is that how you say hello?
Just hold it.

570
00:56:13,808 --> 00:56:16,895
Mrs. Stalker, nice seeing you again.
Axel, get your things,

571
00:56:17,353 --> 00:56:21,065
and we can get going.
I'm not going anywhere, Leo.

572
00:56:21,649 --> 00:56:25,110
I bet you're gonna come.
Paul, hold it. - Alright.

573
00:56:25,569 --> 00:56:31,074
Mrs. Stalker, if we could
just be privately for a moment?

574
00:56:41,459 --> 00:56:42,418
Yes.

575
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:53,553
So you're working on the old airplane?
Don't touch it! - I'm sorry.

576
00:56:57,098 --> 00:56:59,642
It's great! Great.

577
00:57:00,059 --> 00:57:05,022
You should be with your sick uncle,
instead of playing with this nutcase.

578
00:57:05,481 --> 00:57:08,483
You know, this whole airplane...
What did you say?

579
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:12,362
You know what this is for her?
This is like a prescription.

580
00:57:12,821 --> 00:57:17,283
The name you called her!
Oh, I called her a name? - Yes.

581
00:57:17,742 --> 00:57:22,413
What did I call her? Can't remember.
I think I called her... psycho!

582
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:25,624
Psychopath!
When are you gonna get it, Axel?

583
00:57:31,796 --> 00:57:35,425
Nothing like freshly brewed coffee.
It's instant.

584
00:57:37,343 --> 00:57:39,679
I knew that, Mrs. Stalker.

585
00:57:40,096 --> 00:57:44,308
I don't like conflict. - No one said
you did, Mr. Smilie. - Sweetie.

586
00:57:44,767 --> 00:57:47,811
I know no one said that I did.

587
00:57:49,104 --> 00:57:53,399
But we should get down to business.
We don't have any, Mr. Smilie.

588
00:57:53,816 --> 00:57:55,860
Sweetie. Try that.

589
00:57:58,112 --> 00:58:02,575
Very nice. We do have business.
I want him returned to me.

590
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:07,204
He's a man, not an object,
Mr. Smi... Sweetie.

591
00:58:07,621 --> 00:58:09,831
A stranger doesn't tell
a father what a son is.

592
00:58:10,915 --> 00:58:13,793
You'll find
it's not me who's the stranger.

593
00:58:16,087 --> 00:58:18,881
Mrs. Stalker, let me put it this way:

594
00:58:19,298 --> 00:58:22,051
You see that '65 Coup de Ville?
It's a '66, not a '65.

595
00:58:22,509 --> 00:58:26,555
I beg your pardon, it's a '65,
and although it's very nice,

596
00:58:26,972 --> 00:58:31,518
it needs suspension work in the front.
The suspension is perfect.

597
00:58:31,976 --> 00:58:34,062
Fine. Then it needs a new alignment.

598
00:58:34,854 --> 00:58:39,859
Did you come here to give automotive
advice? - Though an older model,

599
00:58:40,317 --> 00:58:42,986
it still has style.
Sugar? - I never use it.

600
00:58:44,446 --> 00:58:46,656
Now imagine if you will,

601
00:58:48,116 --> 00:58:52,579
a brand new Coup de Ville,
fresh from the factory,

602
00:58:53,037 --> 00:58:55,790
sitting alongside your '65.

603
00:58:56,207 --> 00:58:58,584
The beautiful lines of the older model

604
00:58:59,043 --> 00:59:02,838
lose their elegance. The body sags,
the finish is dull. You wash it,

605
00:59:03,297 --> 00:59:08,510
wax it, but it's still lifeless.
Mr. Smilie...

606
00:59:09,344 --> 00:59:13,139
There isn't a thing you can do
to make it new again!

607
00:59:13,598 --> 00:59:16,934
Those two automobiles do not
belong together. Am I clear?

608
00:59:17,393 --> 00:59:21,146
No, the only thing that's clear,
Mr. Smilie... - No! Sweetie!

609
00:59:21,563 --> 00:59:26,526
...is that your attempt to insult me
with car metaphors is incredibly

610
00:59:26,985 --> 00:59:30,613
immature! - Immature! Right!
You could be his mother!

611
00:59:31,072 --> 00:59:34,826
But I'm not,
Mr. Sweetie, I'm his lover.

612
00:59:37,244 --> 00:59:39,496
And I must tell you, your nephew

613
00:59:39,955 --> 00:59:43,458
is a wild animal in bed.
Perhaps you might ask him for lessons.

614
00:59:44,084 --> 00:59:49,422
I had hoped his sexual awakening
would've been with someone who

615
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:52,550
knew the difference
between making love and fucking!

616
01:00:01,475 --> 01:00:05,353
Come on! Coffee break is over,
fellows. Back to work!

617
01:00:05,812 --> 01:00:10,775
Come on, Paul! Axel! Come on!
No! I'm not going!

618
01:00:11,234 --> 01:00:14,946
Paul, grab the other arm!
I'm gonna kick the shit out of you,

619
01:00:15,363 --> 01:00:16,614
little son-of-a-bitch!

620
01:00:18,157 --> 01:00:21,702
Come on, Axel! - You don't realize
how angry... - Just come along!

621
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:24,830
I'm really mad!
Hands off him, Mr. Smilie!

622
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,794
Elaine, you can't shoot me,
I have this performance on Friday.

623
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:34,755
It's an audition.

624
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:38,175
It's not a performance.
It's an audition.

625
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:42,221
This is ridiculous.

626
01:00:42,638 --> 01:00:44,139
I mean...

627
01:00:45,182 --> 01:00:49,227
I mean, Mrs. Stalker,
we've said a lot of things, and some

628
01:00:49,686 --> 01:00:52,063
were half kidding...
Why don't you put down the gun?

629
01:00:53,689 --> 01:00:57,526
That I understand.
That makes sense.

630
01:00:57,985 --> 01:01:00,821
No more of that.

631
01:01:01,238 --> 01:01:03,990
Axel, don't forget, Friday at 8:30!

632
01:01:04,825 --> 01:01:08,870
Yes, get in the car! Go back

633
01:01:09,287 --> 01:01:11,247
to where you should be!

634
01:01:17,169 --> 01:01:20,839
I knew if Paul saw me,
he'd never understand

635
01:01:21,298 --> 01:01:25,468
that going to Papua New Guinea wasn't
the answer. Flying was the secret.

636
01:01:25,927 --> 01:01:30,640
Columbus wouldn't think I was crazy
for building a flying machine,

637
01:01:31,099 --> 01:01:35,811
because history is all dreams.
No rules or books. It's just there,

638
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:40,899
waiting to be discovered
like when Columbus found this place.

639
01:01:41,316 --> 01:01:43,985
I don't know if he found his dream.

640
01:01:44,402 --> 01:01:45,362
Fuck with me, now!

641
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:50,992
Because in the middle of a storm,
you can't turn back, like Elaine.

642
01:01:51,451 --> 01:01:54,286
She could only sail straight ahead.

643
01:01:54,745 --> 01:01:58,290
If she asked me to build a rocket,
and take her to another galaxy,

644
01:01:58,707 --> 01:02:00,542
I'd build a rocket.

645
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:38,840
Very nice! Good.

646
01:03:39,966 --> 01:03:43,303
Excellent! You finished now?
No! - No?

647
01:03:43,762 --> 01:03:45,889
No!
You just finish.

648
01:03:46,306 --> 01:03:48,474
To remember my dreams,

649
01:03:48,933 --> 01:03:52,228
I turn them into stories.
But dreams are like life.

650
01:03:52,686 --> 01:03:56,815
You can't catch them in your hands,
because you can't really see them.

651
01:03:57,232 --> 01:04:01,987
If you believe in your dreams,
no tornado, volcano or typhoon

652
01:04:02,445 --> 01:04:07,492
can knock you "out of love,"
because love exists on its own.

653
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:10,911
Listen to me,
if you ever touch this machine again,

654
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:13,372
I'm going to kill you!

655
01:04:14,289 --> 01:04:17,793
Being caught in the dream of two
women is the craziest storm of all.

656
01:04:18,251 --> 01:04:22,213
The battle isn't good and evil,
but between weaker and stronger.

657
01:04:22,797 --> 01:04:26,718
The weaker is desperate for air.
At this moment, my feet were

658
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:29,387
planted in the ground like a tree,

659
01:04:29,845 --> 01:04:32,806
and if you moved to one side,
you become the storm.

660
01:04:33,265 --> 01:04:37,811
Even though I was ready to kill Grace,
I wasn't sure which side I'd move to.

661
01:04:38,270 --> 01:04:41,273
So I tried to anchor myself
until the storm passed.

662
01:05:09,131 --> 01:05:10,549
Disgusting!

663
01:06:28,871 --> 01:06:29,997
Turn around!

664
01:08:03,416 --> 01:08:05,793
That's the second time.
What is?

665
01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:08,754
Where were you two minutes ago?
Here?

666
01:08:09,797 --> 01:08:12,382
You smashed the flying machine again.
Nope.

667
01:08:12,841 --> 01:08:17,554
Because I don't care. - Liar!
I was here. - Prove it!

668
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:21,933
How? You see me playing, right?

669
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:26,979
To my turtles. - Why's your hair wet?
Because I just took a bath.

670
01:08:30,524 --> 01:08:34,903
You like these turtles? - Yeah.
If you want these bastards to live,

671
01:08:35,737 --> 01:08:40,700
stay away from that flying machine.
I'm scared. - Are you scared?

672
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:43,369
I'm scared.
Are you scared?

673
01:09:11,895 --> 01:09:15,106
D'you think it'll fly?
I'm more than sure.

674
01:09:15,523 --> 01:09:18,610
Let's do it then!
I can't wait any longer.

675
01:10:01,107 --> 01:10:02,942
I'm flying!

676
01:10:12,534 --> 01:10:14,035
I'm flying!

677
01:10:53,405 --> 01:10:56,949
Sometimes you have to
crash into a tree to know what to do,

678
01:10:57,366 --> 01:11:00,703
and realize the secret of anything
is meaningless.

679
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:05,833
My English teacher
talked about this Russian guy,

680
01:11:06,291 --> 01:11:08,877
who said that if you see a gun
in the first half of a book,

681
01:11:09,628 --> 01:11:12,881
you can be sure
it'll go off in the second half.

682
01:11:13,339 --> 01:11:17,677
Somebody was going to use that gun.
The minute I saw the revolver

683
01:11:18,135 --> 01:11:21,263
in the barn,
I started getting nervous, because

684
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:25,058
I realized it was the revolver
from my dream.

685
01:11:26,393 --> 01:11:30,355
Never did I think I'd be an Eskimo
in the desert, knowing

686
01:11:30,814 --> 01:11:34,776
I had to kill something
to put it out of its misery.

687
01:11:35,568 --> 01:11:40,114
Suddenly, it was all clear to me,
like wiping the window in the rain.

688
01:11:42,241 --> 01:11:46,203
I was afraid if I didn't do anything,
at any moment something would blow up,

689
01:11:46,662 --> 01:11:48,747
possibly me.

690
01:11:49,206 --> 01:11:54,335
So I decided to do it,
just to keep from killing myself.

691
01:11:55,878 --> 01:12:00,341
The only problem was
that they were both so miserable,

692
01:12:00,758 --> 01:12:03,344
I didn't know which one to shoot...

693
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:43,130
I've been waiting for you.
What?

694
01:12:43,547 --> 01:12:45,966
Are you gonna use it?

695
01:12:48,134 --> 01:12:50,845
Don't talk to me.
Do it!

696
01:12:53,264 --> 01:12:55,850
What are you afraid of, Axel?

697
01:12:56,892 --> 01:12:58,227
Nothing.

698
01:13:01,897 --> 01:13:03,232
Do it!

699
01:13:13,241 --> 01:13:16,118
Do it, Axel, do it!
Shut up!

700
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:19,955
What are you afraid of, Axel?
Nothing.

701
01:13:20,414 --> 01:13:22,040
Do it!
Shut up!

702
01:13:23,584 --> 01:13:28,213
Do it! - Please shut up, Grace.
Do it! Do it! - Shut up!

703
01:13:30,090 --> 01:13:34,093
If you're not going to shoot me,
sit down on the bed.

704
01:13:35,094 --> 01:13:40,265
You didn't come to shoot me. You came
to make my mother happy. - Don't talk!

705
01:13:42,267 --> 01:13:45,228
Axel. - Turn around!
You know what, Axel?

706
01:13:46,688 --> 01:13:48,606
I had a friend just like you.

707
01:13:49,024 --> 01:13:54,320
When we were little,
we would rollerskate on my huge roof,

708
01:13:54,779 --> 01:13:55,988
no people,

709
01:13:56,447 --> 01:14:01,076
and I each time
I would get closer to the edge,

710
01:14:04,329 --> 01:14:07,999
and he was standing behind me,

711
01:14:08,458 --> 01:14:10,543
and wouldn't let me go over.

712
01:14:18,676 --> 01:14:20,094
Okay.

713
01:14:20,511 --> 01:14:21,887
It's okay.

714
01:14:28,101 --> 01:14:30,061
I have a game for you.

715
01:14:32,105 --> 01:14:34,065
Okay.
Okay.

716
01:14:40,863 --> 01:14:43,615
Old game, strict rules.

717
01:15:06,261 --> 01:15:08,555
It's your turn.
No.

718
01:15:09,806 --> 01:15:12,517
You don't say no to this game.

719
01:15:12,934 --> 01:15:14,435
Okay, I'll go.

720
01:15:18,188 --> 01:15:19,898
Grace... please!

721
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:23,735
Don't.
It's a game, Axel.

722
01:15:24,194 --> 01:15:25,612
Stop! Don't do it!

723
01:15:27,072 --> 01:15:29,240
My mother's sleeping.

724
01:15:29,657 --> 01:15:33,536
Okay, Axel, Look. Look at me!
Fuck you!

725
01:15:36,205 --> 01:15:37,414
No!

726
01:15:44,879 --> 01:15:46,381
Here. Take it.

727
01:15:47,298 --> 01:15:48,883
I don't want it.

728
01:15:49,342 --> 01:15:52,678
What are you, afraid?
No. I just don't feel like dying.

729
01:15:53,095 --> 01:15:55,890
That's not fair.
Not fair?

730
01:15:56,348 --> 01:15:58,642
You came in to kill me,

731
01:15:59,059 --> 01:16:02,604
and we're playing a game,
and you're breaking the rules!

732
01:16:03,688 --> 01:16:06,691
Axel, what are you,
this frightened little boy?

733
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:09,444
You afraid of everything?

734
01:16:11,737 --> 01:16:14,156
Axel? You're just afraid, huh?

735
01:16:15,616 --> 01:16:18,911
You're just a little boy,
you're so scared.

736
01:16:19,328 --> 01:16:21,580
Take the gun!

737
01:16:22,038 --> 01:16:23,456
Take it!

738
01:17:06,204 --> 01:17:07,330
Go!

739
01:17:15,087 --> 01:17:16,171
No!

740
01:17:17,923 --> 01:17:19,007
No, Axel!

741
01:17:19,466 --> 01:17:23,178
You can't do that!
That's breaking the rules!

742
01:17:26,347 --> 01:17:28,224
Lt'll be okay.

743
01:18:52,217 --> 01:18:54,470
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen!

744
01:18:55,846 --> 01:18:58,432
Our next act, Mr. Paul...

745
01:18:58,890 --> 01:19:00,141
Ledger!

746
01:19:01,434 --> 01:19:05,730
Leger. Paul Leger.
Paul Leger!

747
01:19:17,074 --> 01:19:20,118
My n...
Hello. My name is Paul Leger.

748
01:19:21,077 --> 01:19:24,872
You may be wondering what Leger means.

749
01:19:25,331 --> 01:19:29,418
You may be wondering
what kind of name it is. Italian?

750
01:19:29,835 --> 01:19:31,629
Swedish?

751
01:19:32,087 --> 01:19:35,382
Well, actually,
it's French, and it literally means,

752
01:19:35,799 --> 01:19:40,261
"Born to act."
And that's what I'm going to do

753
01:19:40,929 --> 01:19:44,515
this evening.
Alfred Hitchcock style,

754
01:19:44,974 --> 01:19:49,603
performing from the classic,
"North by Northwest."

755
01:19:50,062 --> 01:19:55,067
The famous scene
in which Carey Grant is...

756
01:19:55,525 --> 01:19:58,903
being chased by a crop-dusting plane.

757
01:21:32,155 --> 01:21:33,323
Fuck!

758
01:21:33,740 --> 01:21:34,783
Shit!

759
01:21:49,755 --> 01:21:54,551
Thank you very much, Paul Leger!
I'm not done!

760
01:21:57,595 --> 01:21:59,305
I'm not done!

761
01:22:08,105 --> 01:22:09,648
I'm not done!

762
01:22:33,128 --> 01:22:34,087
Thank you!

763
01:22:34,546 --> 01:22:38,424
A one? One? I was brilliant!
Can't you see brilliance?

764
01:22:38,883 --> 01:22:41,093
A one!
I should have got a ten!

765
01:22:41,552 --> 01:22:44,597
A ten!
A one! A one! On amateur night?

766
01:22:45,014 --> 01:22:48,559
Axel, I really have to talk to you.
Hi, Millie. Sit down.

767
01:22:48,976 --> 01:22:54,272
A one? What do you know about art?
Can we go over there? - Sure.

768
01:22:54,731 --> 01:22:57,901
Elaine. This is Elaine.
This is Millie. - Hello.

769
01:22:58,359 --> 01:23:00,403
Leo's fianc�e.

770
01:23:01,112 --> 01:23:03,906
This is Grace.
Grace, this is Millie.

771
01:23:04,365 --> 01:23:05,991
Okay...

772
01:23:24,091 --> 01:23:26,093
Where is he, Millie? Leo!

773
01:23:27,136 --> 01:23:30,180
He's over here.
He's locked himself in the bedroom.

774
01:23:31,556 --> 01:23:35,268
Leo, can I come in?
Open the door, Leo!

775
01:23:37,770 --> 01:23:39,689
Open up!
Go away!

776
01:23:40,148 --> 01:23:43,692
Let's go inside.
Alright. One... two... three!

777
01:23:56,162 --> 01:23:58,790
Millie! Get an ambulance!

778
01:24:00,541 --> 01:24:02,585
You okay?

779
01:24:10,550 --> 01:24:15,138
Shouldn't I say something?
To who? - Your parents?

780
01:24:15,597 --> 01:24:17,974
They're dead, Leo.

781
01:24:18,433 --> 01:24:21,394
I know that,
but should I say something or not?

782
01:24:21,811 --> 01:24:26,773
Don't talk like that. You'll be fine.
I know, I'm gonna be fine.

783
01:24:48,085 --> 01:24:52,589
Promise you'll take care of Millie.
Don't say that!

784
01:24:53,923 --> 01:24:56,259
Don't talk, just promise.

785
01:24:57,468 --> 01:24:58,803
Alright, I promise.

786
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:03,724
Good, now that that's taken care of,
I want you to...

787
01:25:04,683 --> 01:25:07,311
buy yourself a few nice suits
and go back to New York.

788
01:25:07,728 --> 01:25:10,480
I want to stay with you.
I want to sell cars.

789
01:25:11,731 --> 01:25:15,568
I don't want you to sell cars!
You'll grow up soon enough!

790
01:25:16,027 --> 01:25:17,987
I am grown up, Leo.

791
01:25:19,572 --> 01:25:20,948
I love you.

792
01:25:27,996 --> 01:25:30,874
I'm okay, I'm just...

793
01:25:31,333 --> 01:25:32,917
just stacking cars.

794
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:35,670
I need you to help me.

795
01:25:36,879 --> 01:25:38,464
It's too late.

796
01:25:39,465 --> 01:25:42,676
They're not driving
the big models anymore.

797
01:25:45,137 --> 01:25:49,808
Leo, we can work in the showroom,
we can sell cars together,

798
01:25:50,267 --> 01:25:51,559
you and me.

799
01:25:52,393 --> 01:25:57,773
Too late, Axel, the dream's over.
I've been practicing my "Hellos."

800
01:25:58,232 --> 01:26:00,192
You want to hear my "Hellos"?

801
01:26:03,862 --> 01:26:06,239
I got to start climbing.

802
01:26:08,492 --> 01:26:10,535
It's a long way, Axel.

803
01:26:13,037 --> 01:26:15,748
It's a long way to the moon.

804
01:28:33,958 --> 01:28:35,793
You never came back.

805
01:28:37,545 --> 01:28:41,715
There was a lot of legal stuff
to take care of. I'm sorry.

806
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:47,554
So not even a phone call?

807
01:28:48,012 --> 01:28:52,141
I know, Elaine. I just
got caught up in what was going on.

808
01:28:52,558 --> 01:28:55,936
I'm really sorry.
I wanted to call a thousand times.

809
01:28:56,353 --> 01:28:57,938
I'm really sorry.

810
01:28:59,189 --> 01:29:03,819
So you just decided to pop over
for a quick cup of coffee?

811
01:29:04,277 --> 01:29:08,239
You can just waltz over here?
Please, it's your birthday tomorrow.

812
01:29:08,698 --> 01:29:12,577
What do you care? - My uncle died.
I'm sorry I didn't come sooner,

813
01:29:12,994 --> 01:29:17,039
I had to take care of the funeral.
There's no sympathy here!

814
01:29:17,498 --> 01:29:19,833
Is that okay with you?

815
01:29:24,838 --> 01:29:27,882
Please, let's celebrate your birthday.

816
01:29:28,299 --> 01:29:31,469
What do you care?

817
01:29:32,929 --> 01:29:36,890
You know what you should do?
Turn around and go back.

818
01:29:37,308 --> 01:29:40,269
Just go back
where you came from, OK?

819
01:29:40,727 --> 01:29:42,854
How's Millie, huh?

820
01:29:45,857 --> 01:29:49,527
Where are you going?
What did you just say? I should go.

821
01:29:49,944 --> 01:29:54,448
Are you going? Are you just going to
go now? How long are you going for?

822
01:29:54,865 --> 01:29:58,535
Are you going forever?
Do you want me to stay or go?

823
01:29:58,994 --> 01:30:03,123
I want you to go!
Fine! - I want you!

824
01:30:06,042 --> 01:30:08,002
I want you to come!

825
01:30:18,011 --> 01:30:21,223
So what do you want to do?
You want to go or stay?

826
01:30:22,432 --> 01:30:24,309
I want to stay.

827
01:30:24,768 --> 01:30:27,729
I don't think you need this right now.

828
01:30:29,355 --> 01:30:33,776
She'll be okay.
She just gets like this.

829
01:30:34,235 --> 01:30:38,780
Alright, but I'm not
staying in there tonight, okay?

830
01:30:56,088 --> 01:30:57,548
It's going to be okay...

831
01:30:58,382 --> 01:31:00,050
Nothing is going to be OK!

832
01:31:01,009 --> 01:31:02,219
Come on!

833
01:31:03,845 --> 01:31:07,473
Elaine, wait!
I brought you a present.

834
01:31:07,932 --> 01:31:11,977
I don't want it!
You don't even know what it is!

835
01:31:12,436 --> 01:31:14,647
Elaine, you don't know what it is.

836
01:31:16,607 --> 01:31:18,900
Come on, Elaine, please. Take it.

837
01:31:19,359 --> 01:31:22,737
I don't want it.
It's a present!

838
01:31:23,196 --> 01:31:27,325
Thank you for the wad of paper.
It's two tickets for Shishmaref.

839
01:31:27,742 --> 01:31:29,452
It's right on the Bering Sea.

840
01:31:29,911 --> 01:31:35,082
Train tickets? - Yeah. - You expect me
me to go all the way to Alaska

841
01:31:35,499 --> 01:31:38,960
by train? - You said you didn't want
to fly again... - No, I didn't!

842
01:31:39,377 --> 01:31:42,088
Yes, you did! - No, I didn't!
Yes, you did! - No, I didn't!

843
01:31:42,547 --> 01:31:45,008
I want to fly there.
Okay.

844
01:31:54,683 --> 01:31:59,813
I'm gonna cancel the train tickets
and make a plane reservation, okay?

845
01:32:00,897 --> 01:32:03,358
Alright.
Stop!

846
01:32:04,442 --> 01:32:08,196
What?
You think I'm old, don't you?

847
01:32:09,447 --> 01:32:12,616
No! - Yes, you do.
Don't tell me what I think.

848
01:32:13,075 --> 01:32:16,411
That's why the train, you're ashamed!
No, I'm not! I'm going to

849
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:19,748
trade these tickets in.
I don't mind. You're right.

850
01:32:20,165 --> 01:32:22,917
I'm old, you're young.
It's disgusting!

851
01:32:23,376 --> 01:32:26,587
Just stop it!
Can't you find someone your own age?

852
01:32:27,004 --> 01:32:30,007
Why me? - I want to be with you!
I don't need your pity!

853
01:32:30,466 --> 01:32:36,305
It's not pity, Elaine. I'm trying
to give you love. - Love!

854
01:32:36,763 --> 01:32:40,725
What do you know about love?
What do you know? - You're a child!

855
01:32:42,102 --> 01:32:45,480
What you need is someone sweet...

856
01:32:46,272 --> 01:32:47,857
and beautiful...

857
01:32:49,483 --> 01:32:51,735
and young!
Like who?

858
01:32:52,945 --> 01:32:54,655
Like Millie.

859
01:32:55,113 --> 01:32:58,450
She's like Switzerland,
beautiful but dumb. - Listen.

860
01:32:59,409 --> 01:33:03,746
She was my uncle's fianc�e.
I don't want her. I want you!

861
01:33:04,372 --> 01:33:08,334
This is crazy! - Ronny used to
say that, and Grace still says it,

862
01:33:08,793 --> 01:33:11,920
"Take your medication, Mother,
or you'll be crazy."

863
01:33:12,379 --> 01:33:16,174
But he hurt her,
and I killed him,

864
01:33:16,633 --> 01:33:20,220
and I'm not crazy!
And I'm not your husband!

865
01:33:20,678 --> 01:33:24,307
Do you understand?
You are fucking crazy! - Get out!

866
01:33:24,724 --> 01:33:26,851
I'm not damn leaving!
Get out of my house!

867
01:33:27,310 --> 01:33:30,646
You asked me to stay!
I did not! I want you to go!

868
01:33:31,105 --> 01:33:34,900
Go! - I'm fucking tired of this game.
What do you want?

869
01:33:35,359 --> 01:33:39,904
What do you want?
I want you to understand me!

870
01:33:41,030 --> 01:33:44,784
You know something?
What? - Paul was right.

871
01:33:46,452 --> 01:33:48,287
Paul was right?
Paul was right.

872
01:33:49,705 --> 01:33:51,081
Paul was right?

873
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:54,626
You listen to him?
What did he say?

874
01:33:55,043 --> 01:33:56,420
Nothing.
What?

875
01:33:56,837 --> 01:33:59,881
Not a fucking thing!
I'm going to find out... who I am.

876
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:04,051
You're going nowhere!
Where are you gonna go?

877
01:34:04,510 --> 01:34:07,638
Let me go!
Elaine, come on, you're not crazy.

878
01:34:08,097 --> 01:34:11,058
Show me you're not crazy!
Let me go!

879
01:34:13,435 --> 01:34:18,356
I don't think you're old. I think
you're beautiful. Don't say it again.

880
01:34:18,815 --> 01:34:20,150
Let me go!

881
01:34:20,567 --> 01:34:21,859
Stop!

882
01:34:24,612 --> 01:34:27,114
Elaine!
Get out of my life! - Put it down!

883
01:34:27,573 --> 01:34:29,325
Put it down!
Get out of my house!

884
01:34:33,745 --> 01:34:36,289
That's enough!
No!

885
01:34:36,998 --> 01:34:38,541
That's enough!

886
01:35:36,386 --> 01:35:38,972
I can't believe she did it!

887
01:36:00,658 --> 01:36:02,618
I'm going to fly!

888
01:36:17,382 --> 01:36:19,175
You fucked my wife?

889
01:36:21,802 --> 01:36:23,596
You fucked my wife?

890
01:38:14,114 --> 01:38:15,323
Oh, fuck!

891
01:38:19,952 --> 01:38:21,162
Come on!

892
01:38:23,205 --> 01:38:27,709
Listen! That is Mexico!
This is America.

893
01:38:28,168 --> 01:38:31,755
We speak English.
Yes. - Look at his face!

894
01:38:35,925 --> 01:38:38,719
What do you mean?

895
01:39:02,032 --> 01:39:03,117
Shit!

896
01:39:42,611 --> 01:39:46,865
Paul, will you quit it?
I'm having a nightmare!

897
01:39:53,788 --> 01:39:56,958
You're distracting her.
She's trying to fly the plane.

898
01:39:57,375 --> 01:39:59,668
Please!
This isn't happening!

899
01:40:19,103 --> 01:40:20,729
I hate this film!

900
01:40:35,868 --> 01:40:37,745
Life is beautiful.

901
01:40:40,331 --> 01:40:42,791
I think what you did is beautiful.

902
01:40:47,546 --> 01:40:48,588
Thanks.

903
01:40:49,964 --> 01:40:51,925
I'm sorry about your uncle.

904
01:40:54,427 --> 01:40:56,137
Yeah, me too.

905
01:40:57,555 --> 01:40:59,932
Where d'you think he is right now?

906
01:41:00,974 --> 01:41:02,267
Right now?

907
01:41:04,853 --> 01:41:09,816
He's probably on the moon,
driving a golden Cadillac.

908
01:41:14,153 --> 01:41:16,030
Life is beautiful.

909
01:41:17,907 --> 01:41:19,950
Grace?
Yeah.

910
01:41:23,412 --> 01:41:26,540
D'you think
it would be really bad if...

911
01:41:29,459 --> 01:41:31,544
I kissed you?
No.

912
01:41:32,587 --> 01:41:33,546
No?

913
01:41:59,611 --> 01:42:01,113
You want to hear it?

914
01:42:03,490 --> 01:42:07,452
I'm sorry. - Are you going to listen?
Yes. - Alright.

915
01:42:07,911 --> 01:42:12,248
Elaine is like a blueberry pie.
The pie is good, but it's very messy.

916
01:42:12,707 --> 01:42:17,628
She's a kind of trick. - Oh my gosh!
Let's say she's a blueberry pie.

917
01:42:18,504 --> 01:42:20,964
She looks good. She smells good.

918
01:42:21,423 --> 01:42:24,801
Probably even tastes good,
but there's one problem:

919
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:29,597
When you take a bite, you've got
pins poking you in the mouth.

920
01:42:30,223 --> 01:42:34,685
Choking you in the mouth.
You understand what I'm telling you?

921
01:42:35,144 --> 01:42:36,937
Good boy. Do you understand?

922
01:42:37,354 --> 01:42:39,731
Do you understand?
Yeah. - Okay.

923
01:42:40,190 --> 01:42:43,110
These philosophies,
with pies and bananas

924
01:42:43,568 --> 01:42:45,445
and Q-tips and...

925
01:42:45,904 --> 01:42:47,947
I'm an artist.

926
01:42:49,032 --> 01:42:52,410
You're a bullshit artist.
Bullshit artist, artist, whatever.

927
01:42:52,952 --> 01:42:56,705
Art is art.
Axel, it's my birthday. Dance?

928
01:42:57,164 --> 01:42:58,957
Run! Beautiful.

929
01:43:02,127 --> 01:43:03,086
Sure.

930
01:43:06,381 --> 01:43:09,801
I was right.
What time is the train for Alaska?

931
01:43:10,259 --> 01:43:13,054
You mean the plane?
No, the train.

932
01:43:13,471 --> 01:43:16,181
We're flying.
Didn't you fly all day?

933
01:43:16,599 --> 01:43:20,060
You can't take that all the way
to Alaska, it's too cold.

934
01:43:20,519 --> 01:43:23,897
I don't want to fly there.
I already changed the reservations.

935
01:43:24,314 --> 01:43:26,733
We have to take the train. It's safer.

936
01:43:28,234 --> 01:43:31,654
So you want me to
switch the plane reservations

937
01:43:32,071 --> 01:43:36,325
into train reservations?
Yes. - Okay.

938
01:44:29,415 --> 01:44:30,541
It's time.

939
01:44:45,597 --> 01:44:49,183
37, 38, 39, 40...

940
01:45:26,426 --> 01:45:29,136
Stairs, stairs, stairs...

941
01:45:29,595 --> 01:45:31,347
Wall... Axel?

942
01:45:31,806 --> 01:45:33,557
Axel, here, here.

943
01:45:34,558 --> 01:45:35,893
I'm sorry.

944
01:45:41,606 --> 01:45:44,442
Don't touch me.
Watch my face.

945
01:45:45,068 --> 01:45:47,820
Axel?
Watch my face. Wait.

946
01:45:48,279 --> 01:45:49,363
Wait.

947
01:45:55,119 --> 01:45:57,454
Stairs!
Stairs!

948
01:45:58,663 --> 01:46:00,665
Axel!
Stairs!

949
01:46:01,124 --> 01:46:02,250
Tree!

950
01:46:08,214 --> 01:46:09,882
Tree and table!

951
01:46:16,805 --> 01:46:18,890
I can't see nothing. Axel!

952
01:46:21,893 --> 01:46:23,478
I can't see!

953
01:46:26,481 --> 01:46:28,149
Wait for me!

954
01:46:30,067 --> 01:46:31,485
I found it!

955
01:46:32,152 --> 01:46:34,029
What?
Here!

956
01:46:34,488 --> 01:46:37,532
She found it! - Here!
She found it! - Wait for me!

957
01:46:37,991 --> 01:46:40,660
I found it!

958
01:46:41,119 --> 01:46:42,912
Come on, I found it!

959
01:46:43,371 --> 01:46:46,916
Paul!
Axel! I can't see nothing!

960
01:46:47,416 --> 01:46:51,045
Axel?
Where are you?

961
01:46:51,503 --> 01:46:53,338
Here? Okay everybody?

962
01:46:56,717 --> 01:46:58,093
It's raining!

963
01:46:59,135 --> 01:47:00,595
It's raining!

964
01:47:10,563 --> 01:47:11,981
It's raining!

965
01:47:13,107 --> 01:47:14,816
Come on, it's raining.

966
01:47:27,578 --> 01:47:28,996
It's raining.

967
01:47:34,376 --> 01:47:36,128
It's fucking raining!

968
01:47:38,338 --> 01:47:41,049
Mom! Mother!
Yes!

969
01:47:42,675 --> 01:47:44,886
I'm coming over, mom!

970
01:47:45,344 --> 01:47:48,514
Here we go! Happy Birthday!
I love you. - I love you!

971
01:47:48,931 --> 01:47:51,266
Happy Birthday!
I love you.

972
01:47:52,601 --> 01:47:54,436
I'm going in!

973
01:48:27,133 --> 01:48:28,467
Go play.

974
01:48:30,177 --> 01:48:31,470
Go play.

975
01:48:47,234 --> 01:48:51,864
Did I tell you about when Axel treated
me for my 21st birthday dinner?

976
01:48:52,281 --> 01:48:55,492
My good pal? - No.
Can I tell her the story?

977
01:48:55,951 --> 01:49:00,496
Or would you like to?
Go ahead. - Anyway, he decided

978
01:49:00,955 --> 01:49:05,084
he was going to take me out for dinner
and pay for it himself.

979
01:49:05,543 --> 01:49:10,672
He'd saved up some money.
We go to this restaurant.

980
01:49:11,089 --> 01:49:15,510
This place we used to go with Leo.
We drove up there together...

981
01:49:15,927 --> 01:49:18,221
and we had this great big meal.

982
01:49:18,638 --> 01:49:22,934
I knew it would be expensive,
but he said, "The sky's the limit."

983
01:49:23,392 --> 01:49:27,354
After dinner I went to the bathroom,
and when I come out,

984
01:49:27,771 --> 01:49:32,442
I see him standing by the door,
and he looks unusually nervous.

985
01:49:32,901 --> 01:49:37,572
And the waiter is standing by
our table, flapping the check,

986
01:49:38,031 --> 01:49:41,576
kind of pointing at the check.
And I look at Axel... - You coming?

987
01:49:42,034 --> 01:49:44,745
I go up to him,
"What's going on? Did you pay?"

988
01:49:45,162 --> 01:49:47,122
Will you help me wrap the presents?

989
01:49:47,581 --> 01:49:51,043
"You said you were paying."
He made me bring no money.

990
01:49:51,501 --> 01:49:53,670
I say, "Whaddya mean
you have no money, Axel?"

991
01:49:54,129 --> 01:49:58,299
Next thing I know, we're being chased
by our waiter,

992
01:49:58,716 --> 01:50:00,968
who was fifty, but, like, mean...

993
01:50:05,890 --> 01:50:08,100
Hi!
Hi!

994
01:50:16,232 --> 01:50:17,567
What's that?

995
01:50:19,819 --> 01:50:21,237
No!

996
01:50:23,739 --> 01:50:25,199
Very nice!

997
01:50:29,244 --> 01:50:31,330
I want you to have something.

998
01:50:32,873 --> 01:50:34,624
For me?
Uh huh.

999
01:50:36,334 --> 01:50:39,962
It's beautiful.
I want you to have the world.

1000
01:50:41,964 --> 01:50:43,132
Thank you.

1001
01:50:45,884 --> 01:50:49,179
I was thinking about what you said.
What did I say?

1002
01:50:50,263 --> 01:50:54,642
That I was supposed to be with you.
Hand me that tape?

1003
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:56,519
Yeah.

1004
01:50:58,438 --> 01:51:02,775
When I first met her I felt something,

1005
01:51:03,192 --> 01:51:04,944
kind of strong.

1006
01:51:06,236 --> 01:51:08,197
I didn't know what it was.

1007
01:51:09,197 --> 01:51:11,199
I didn't know what to call it.

1008
01:51:13,034 --> 01:51:16,871
Now everything's turned around,
and she's like...

1009
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:21,334
She's like this cloud

1010
01:51:22,460 --> 01:51:27,506
that I can see through,
and on the other side I see you.

1011
01:51:32,385 --> 01:51:35,138
And I feel something very strong.

1012
01:51:40,268 --> 01:51:42,686
I think I know what to call it.

1013
01:51:46,774 --> 01:51:48,734
That make any sense?

1014
01:51:50,777 --> 01:51:52,529
Put your finger here?

1015
01:51:54,906 --> 01:51:57,075
Yup. What do you think?

1016
01:51:59,076 --> 01:52:02,621
About what?
About us, kind of...

1017
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:04,581
belonging together.

1018
01:52:05,582 --> 01:52:08,085
Will Paul like this lamp?

1019
01:52:08,543 --> 01:52:11,338
He'll love it.
What do you think?

1020
01:52:15,633 --> 01:52:18,052
I think 2 wrongs don't make a right.

1021
01:52:18,469 --> 01:52:21,972
Meaning what?
Meaning us. Two wrongs.

1022
01:52:23,766 --> 01:52:27,352
What if we're two rights,
and everybody else is wrong?

1023
01:52:30,730 --> 01:52:33,858
Either way, we're going to be screwed.
But screwed together.

1024
01:52:36,527 --> 01:52:40,948
I wish I could take you with me.
Let's go right now! No trains,

1025
01:52:41,699 --> 01:52:46,036
no planes, no fucking doors.
We'll go right out the window!

1026
01:52:47,663 --> 01:52:50,248
I have to take care of some business.

1027
01:52:55,628 --> 01:52:57,922
The house?
Yes.

1028
01:53:02,092 --> 01:53:07,222
Last night I dreamt I'm in the desert,
and my house is tied around my neck,

1029
01:53:07,681 --> 01:53:11,434
and my body's breaking under its
weight, and it's engulfed in flames.

1030
01:53:11,893 --> 01:53:14,729
The flames are climbing the rope, and

1031
01:53:15,146 --> 01:53:19,025
they almost reach my neck, and before
they do, I wake up, and I know

1032
01:53:19,483 --> 01:53:21,777
that I have to get rid of this house.

1033
01:53:24,363 --> 01:53:27,699
I want you to promise me something.
What?

1034
01:53:29,576 --> 01:53:34,080
When you're done with the house,
we can go away.

1035
01:53:35,581 --> 01:53:36,666
Come on!

1036
01:53:37,667 --> 01:53:38,793
Come on!

1037
01:53:45,007 --> 01:53:46,091
I promise.

1038
01:53:47,509 --> 01:53:48,927
You promise?
Yeah.

1039
01:53:49,511 --> 01:53:51,221
I promise.

1040
01:53:53,264 --> 01:53:54,223
Good.

1041
01:54:02,231 --> 01:54:04,900
It's a funny story.

1042
01:54:13,574 --> 01:54:15,993
I have a lot of funny stories.

1043
01:54:28,588 --> 01:54:30,215
Here they are!

1044
01:54:32,258 --> 01:54:36,596
Is this is for me?
You bought this for me? Very nice.

1045
01:54:38,305 --> 01:54:39,265
Here.

1046
01:54:40,474 --> 01:54:41,600
Thank you.

1047
01:54:42,059 --> 01:54:44,019
You open yours first.

1048
01:54:46,229 --> 01:54:48,189
Look what I got from her.

1049
01:54:48,648 --> 01:54:50,567
I feel like a clam, right?

1050
01:54:51,651 --> 01:54:55,238
I've always wanted to be a big
sea turtle. They're always happy.

1051
01:54:55,655 --> 01:55:00,326
How do you know that it's happy?
Because they're always smiling.

1052
01:55:00,784 --> 01:55:04,079
Turtles don't smile.
They do. - They don't.

1053
01:55:05,205 --> 01:55:09,292
I don't think turtles smile.
They do, and they live forever.

1054
01:55:09,751 --> 01:55:14,297
Who wants to live forever?
I'd like to die when I'm 35.

1055
01:55:15,214 --> 01:55:19,009
You want to die when you're 35?
Yes. - How?

1056
01:55:19,468 --> 01:55:24,848
How? I'd take off all my clothes and
get into a bathtub of ice-cold vodka.

1057
01:55:25,307 --> 01:55:28,852
I'd have the TV in the room,
watching "North by Northwest,"

1058
01:55:29,310 --> 01:55:33,439
when the airplane scene comes,
I'd pull the TV into the tub.

1059
01:55:33,898 --> 01:55:35,733
I hate that film!

1060
01:55:36,817 --> 01:55:39,278
I'd like to die as a little girl.

1061
01:55:39,695 --> 01:55:44,032
I'd go up on the roof
and jump off, and I'd be flying.

1062
01:55:44,449 --> 01:55:49,370
I'd look down and see all the people,
but instead of falling, I'd just fly,

1063
01:55:49,829 --> 01:55:51,748
higher and higher.

1064
01:55:53,875 --> 01:55:55,376
What did I get?

1065
01:55:55,835 --> 01:55:59,254
What is this thing?
Lava lamp. - Nice.

1066
01:55:59,838 --> 01:56:02,841
Axel, what about you?
It's very nice.

1067
01:56:03,300 --> 01:56:05,051
I'd like to be...

1068
01:56:05,510 --> 01:56:11,099
I'd like to be thrown off a cliff, and
my body could smash into the rocks.

1069
01:56:12,767 --> 01:56:18,272
But I wouldn't want a lot of people
at the funeral, looking at me.

1070
01:56:19,189 --> 01:56:22,776
You'd be smashed up. Why would you
want them to look at you? - I don't

1071
01:56:23,235 --> 01:56:26,112
want to be in the box,
people staring at me.

1072
01:56:26,529 --> 01:56:29,198
You'll wind up living forever.
No.

1073
01:56:29,657 --> 01:56:31,951
Grace, what about you?

1074
01:56:32,785 --> 01:56:34,912
Me? I'm not gong to die.

1075
01:56:35,329 --> 01:56:39,792
I'm going to live forever, until one
day I'll wake up and I'll be a turtle.

1076
01:56:40,250 --> 01:56:41,752
Turtle-Grace!

1077
01:56:49,634 --> 01:56:50,843
Sing it!

1078
01:57:10,778 --> 01:57:12,780
Night.
Good night.

1079
01:57:14,156 --> 01:57:15,574
I love you.

1080
01:57:18,577 --> 01:57:21,913
Good night. - Why "Good night"?
We just got by the fire.

1081
01:57:22,372 --> 01:57:26,626
We're having a good time.
I have to get up and do things.

1082
01:57:27,043 --> 01:57:30,588
Stay a little while.
Come on.

1083
01:57:31,047 --> 01:57:35,009
Come on!
Okay, I'll see you. "Good bye."

1084
01:57:36,260 --> 01:57:37,761
Come on, Grace!

1085
01:57:39,263 --> 01:57:42,307
Is something wrong?
Did I say something?

1086
01:58:03,535 --> 01:58:05,370
Come on!

1087
01:58:26,639 --> 01:58:30,434
Axel, I'm tired too.
In the middle of the song!

1088
01:58:30,893 --> 01:58:33,938
Are you coming, Axel?
Yup. Good night.

1089
01:58:34,355 --> 01:58:38,775
Just leave me in the middle of a song!
I had a great moment!

1090
01:58:40,735 --> 01:58:43,780
Go up and sleep,
leaving me soaking wet here!

1091
01:58:44,197 --> 01:58:48,826
Good night, Paul. - Night, Elaine.
Wasn't that a funny story I said?

1092
01:58:49,243 --> 01:58:52,496
What do you know about funny?
Throw your dinner on the floor.

1093
01:58:52,913 --> 01:58:57,584
No one wants to cut the birthday cake.
Well, I'll cut the cake, thank you.

1094
01:58:58,043 --> 01:59:01,338
Happy Birthday to me!
Happy Birthday to Paul!

1095
01:59:01,755 --> 01:59:03,715
That's me! Paul!

1096
01:59:04,174 --> 01:59:08,136
Looks like she left about
45 candles off the cake.

1097
01:59:12,681 --> 01:59:16,143
Alright! Good!
Enough, guys. Enough!

1098
01:59:16,602 --> 01:59:19,563
Stop! Come on.

1099
01:59:20,855 --> 01:59:25,902
I've got to work.
Time is money. Have a drink.

1100
01:59:40,040 --> 01:59:42,167
You need a drink.

1101
01:59:42,625 --> 01:59:46,546
Go home, suffer with your families.
Suffer like animals!

1102
01:59:49,006 --> 01:59:54,053
Why do I have to talk to four
fake artists? That's my day!

1103
01:59:54,720 --> 01:59:56,221
So good!

1104
02:00:02,852 --> 02:00:04,437
"The Godfather"!

1105
02:00:04,896 --> 02:00:10,609
...big deal, and there was something
in it for me if I could help him out.

1106
02:00:11,026 --> 02:00:15,155
He said you were being
tough on the negotiations,

1107
02:00:15,614 --> 02:00:18,825
but if they could get
a little help and close the deal fast,

1108
02:00:19,409 --> 02:00:23,329
it'd be good for the family.
Do you believe that?

1109
02:00:24,247 --> 02:00:28,042
Do you believe that? - He said
there was something in it for me!

1110
02:00:28,501 --> 02:00:31,587
On my own!
I've always taken care of you.

1111
02:00:32,338 --> 02:00:34,006
Taken care of me?

1112
02:00:35,299 --> 02:00:37,717
You're my kid brother!
You take care of me?

1113
02:00:38,260 --> 02:00:42,430
You ever think about that?
You ever once think about that?

1114
02:00:43,473 --> 02:00:47,143
Send Freddo off to do this!

1115
02:00:48,102 --> 02:00:52,106
Let Freddo take care of...
...some Mickey Mouse night club.

1116
02:00:52,564 --> 02:00:55,150
Send Freddo
to pick up somebody at the airport!

1117
02:00:55,609 --> 02:00:59,321
I'm your older brother, and
I was stepped over! - Pop wanted it.

1118
02:00:59,738 --> 02:01:01,990
It ain't the way I wanted it!

1119
02:01:03,074 --> 02:01:05,201
I can handle things, I'm smart!

1120
02:01:05,618 --> 02:01:11,165
Not like everybody says,
I'm smart and I want respect!

1121
02:01:15,377 --> 02:01:18,088
Tell me about the investigation.

1122
02:01:18,922 --> 02:01:20,924
The Senate lawyer,

1123
02:01:22,925 --> 02:01:24,510
he belongs to Wroth.

1124
02:01:31,016 --> 02:01:32,434
Freddo,

1125
02:01:34,728 --> 02:01:36,688
you're nothing to me now,

1126
02:01:39,024 --> 02:01:42,110
not a brother,
not a friend.

1127
02:01:43,069 --> 02:01:45,905
I don't want
to know you, or what you do.

1128
02:01:47,073 --> 02:01:50,868
I don't want to see you in hotels.
I don't want you near my house.

1129
02:01:54,288 --> 02:01:57,123
When you see our mother,
I want to know a day in advance,

1130
02:01:57,540 --> 02:01:59,375
so I won't be there.

1131
02:02:00,460 --> 02:02:02,045
Understand?

1132
02:02:11,762 --> 02:02:12,721
Mikey!

1133
02:02:19,602 --> 02:02:23,564
I don't want anything happenin' to ya,
not while our mother is alive.

1134
02:04:24,633 --> 02:04:25,884
Grace!

1135
02:04:49,156 --> 02:04:50,657
Go home!

1136
02:04:53,159 --> 02:04:55,787
Grace! No! Grace!

1137
02:05:37,825 --> 02:05:39,452
You promised!

1138
02:06:48,348 --> 02:06:51,643
For the last time, I heard a voice
that wasn't my mother's,

1139
02:06:52,102 --> 02:06:54,479
whispering, "Good morning, Columbus."

1140
02:06:54,937 --> 02:07:00,443
It didn't bother me. Then the voice
became lower and turned into a wind

1141
02:07:00,901 --> 02:07:04,988
that sent the peaceful smell
of cheap cologne.

1142
02:07:05,447 --> 02:07:10,535
And I realized, like Columbus, I had
to live in a world of cheap cologne,

1143
02:07:10,952 --> 02:07:14,038
and I wasn't sure any discovery
in America was possible anymore.

1144
02:07:14,914 --> 02:07:17,583
Smoothing roads and counting fish
wasn't science,

1145
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,753
but somehow
it prepared me for the ocean...

1146
02:07:21,212 --> 02:07:25,340
I don't know why, but my father's
words jumped back into my head,

1147
02:07:25,799 --> 02:07:27,884
that work was like a hat on your head,

1148
02:07:28,343 --> 02:07:32,138
and even if you didn't have any pants,
you shouldn't be ashamed of your ass,

1149
02:07:32,597 --> 02:07:34,307
because you had a hat.

1150
02:07:35,224 --> 02:07:39,770
And even though my uncle Leo
worked for everything he got,

1151
02:07:40,187 --> 02:07:42,022
I'm not sure he got what he needed.

1152
02:07:42,481 --> 02:07:44,483
Elaine and Grace
were really one person,

1153
02:07:44,942 --> 02:07:49,529
too big for one body, no matter how
much they loved or hated each other.

1154
02:07:51,281 --> 02:07:55,451
After the storm,
I couldn't say life was beautiful,

1155
02:07:55,868 --> 02:07:58,621
but all I kept hoping for
was the Eskimo boy in my dream

1156
02:07:59,038 --> 02:08:02,249
to run out of one of these doors
and hug me.

1157
02:08:02,666 --> 02:08:08,296
Though I no longer felt like a fish,
and realized I knew nothing,

1158
02:08:08,713 --> 02:08:10,840
I was happy to be alive...

1159
02:09:24,991 --> 02:09:28,912
What a wonderful fish.
What a wonderful fish!

1160
02:09:29,746 --> 02:09:31,789
Yes, wonderful.

1161
02:09:32,248 --> 02:09:36,127
We have to catch it today.
We will catch it today.

1162
02:09:36,585 --> 02:09:41,381
Do the eyes start
on either side of the head?

1163
02:09:41,840 --> 02:09:44,134
Yes, it's a very strange fish.

1164
02:09:44,593 --> 02:09:49,222
When it becomes an adult,
one eye moves across, joins the other.

1165
02:09:50,473 --> 02:09:54,477
Why do they do that?
Maybe it's like a...

1166
02:09:57,813 --> 02:10:02,234
A badge of maturity. They passed
through the nightmare. - Nightmare?

1167
02:10:04,611 --> 02:10:07,989
The nightmare
that separates children from adults.

1168
02:10:09,282 --> 02:10:11,367
Come.
Quickly.

1169
02:10:16,413 --> 02:10:19,500
We got it! We got it!

1170
02:10:20,918 --> 02:10:23,086
We got it! Slowly.

1171
02:10:23,670 --> 02:10:24,671
Slowly!

1172
02:10:25,672 --> 02:10:26,673
Slowly!

1173
02:10:27,507 --> 02:10:30,385
Don't move! Don't move!

1174
02:10:32,261 --> 02:10:37,808
Look, its color changes to match
the ocean floor. - Camouflage.

1175
02:10:38,267 --> 02:10:42,479
If one Arrowtooth Halibut
sinks on top of the head of another,

1176
02:10:42,896 --> 02:10:47,650
the bottom one doesn't make a fuss,
but waits until the other one moves.

1177
02:10:48,109 --> 02:10:52,405
I wouldn't like anyone to sit
on my head. - You are still young.

1178
02:10:52,822 --> 02:10:56,325
One eye begins
to move to the other side.

1179
02:10:57,368 --> 02:11:02,205
Then it's better to have both eyes
on the same side? - No. Different.

1180
02:11:02,664 --> 02:11:04,499
What do you lose?

1181
02:11:05,500 --> 02:11:10,546
Your other side. You lose something,
but you also gain something.
