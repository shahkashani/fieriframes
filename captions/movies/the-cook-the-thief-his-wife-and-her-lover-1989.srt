1
00:01:48,705 --> 00:01:50,912
Go and get the dogs.

2
00:01:55,212 --> 00:01:57,619
Come on, then. Mews!

3
00:02:02,636 --> 00:02:07,512
Come on, now. Open your mouth.
Open your mouth, eh?

4
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:10,434
Learn to appreciate your food, eh?

5
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:16,023
Compared to what you serve up
in that dirty little canteen of yours,

6
00:02:16,108 --> 00:02:19,607
this is a three-star supper.

7
00:02:20,612 --> 00:02:23,732
You must learn the rules.

8
00:02:23,824 --> 00:02:27,691
I need to eat and drink the very best
and that's expensive.

9
00:02:27,786 --> 00:02:30,573
Have you ever heard of
chicken à la reine Marie

10
00:02:30,664 --> 00:02:32,787
or oyster sauce mornay

11
00:02:32,874 --> 00:02:35,366
or frogs' legs Parisienne?

12
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,500
No. Course you haven't.

13
00:02:37,588 --> 00:02:40,672
Take his pants down! Take his pants down.

14
00:02:48,974 --> 00:02:51,726
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

15
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,345
Didn't your daddy teach you
to wipe your bottom? Eh?

16
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:57,562
Albert! Leave him alone.

17
00:02:57,649 --> 00:03:00,484
- Come on, let's eat.
- Oh, let's eat.

18
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:05,314
Before we eat, Georgina,
we must feed and water the animals.

19
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:09,865
Roy! This is my wife, Georgina Spica.

20
00:03:09,953 --> 00:03:12,444
She's got a heart of gold
and a body to match.

21
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:17,285
I am Albert Spica and I have a heart of gold
and a great deal of money to match.

22
00:03:17,377 --> 00:03:21,021
And you are Roy,
who's got absolutely nothing,

23
00:03:21,032 --> 00:03:22,892
except what you owe me.

24
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:28,720
You are humiliated in front of a lady,
you're humiliated in front of us.

25
00:03:28,805 --> 00:03:32,755
Georgina, I'll be as quick
as I possibly can.

26
00:03:32,851 --> 00:03:35,949
Goh- You, go and get me some hot water, eh?

27
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,440
And a towel and soap.

28
00:03:37,522 --> 00:03:39,729
Now...

29
00:03:39,816 --> 00:03:42,438
Yeah.

30
00:03:42,527 --> 00:03:46,359
Now I've given you a good dinner
and you can have a nice drink.

31
00:03:46,448 --> 00:03:49,734
Now, you behave yourself in future
and pay when I ask you.

32
00:03:49,826 --> 00:03:50,606
No, no, no...

33
00:03:50,617 --> 00:03:52,956
Or next time I'll make you eat your own shit

34
00:03:53,038 --> 00:03:56,158
after forcing it through
your dick like toothpaste.

35
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:01,244
No, put that away, Spangler.
Cor blimey, there's a lady present.

36
00:04:01,338 --> 00:04:05,122
She doesn't want to see
your shrivelled contributions.

37
00:04:05,217 --> 00:04:07,174
Ah.

38
00:04:07,261 --> 00:04:10,427
That's it. Thank you very much.
Nice, clean...

39
00:04:10,514 --> 00:04:12,969
Give me that towel!

40
00:04:13,058 --> 00:04:15,300
Give me that. Yeah.

41
00:04:15,394 --> 00:04:20,898
I never liked that Chinese food
but looking at you now, I like it even less.

42
00:04:20,983 --> 00:04:23,390
Righto, boys!

43
00:04:23,485 --> 00:04:26,901
We must surprise Richard on our anniversary.

44
00:04:26,989 --> 00:04:29,147
Bring the letters.

45
00:04:30,158 --> 00:04:34,867
Georgie, you got ash on your tits.
If you're gonna wear black, don't smoke.

46
00:04:34,955 --> 00:04:38,454
- You look like a tart in black.
- It's blue.

47
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:42,207
It's black, and don't smoke.
It's sloppy in a woman.

48
00:04:42,296 --> 00:04:44,537
No one who's going to eat smokes.

49
00:04:44,631 --> 00:04:48,759
It ruins your taste buds, burns your tongue
and makes your pee stink.

50
00:04:48,844 --> 00:04:51,251
- Rubbish.
- It's not bloody rubbish.

51
00:04:51,346 --> 00:04:54,715
I've smelt the loo
after you've been piddling in there.

52
00:04:54,808 --> 00:04:57,762
When are you gonna learn, smartarse?

53
00:05:00,397 --> 00:05:07,527

Where's Richard?

64
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:10,046
- He's plucking.
- He's plucking, eh? Richard!

65
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:13,051
Where are you?
Stop that plucking. Where are you?

66
00:06:13,136 --> 00:06:16,007
Now what's that? A-S-P...

67
00:06:16,098 --> 00:06:20,676
That's nonsense.
Spell it right, for Christ's sake.

68
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:24,434
Bloody hell. Richard! Rich... Ah!

69
00:06:24,523 --> 00:06:27,228
There you are, Richard. Now...

70
00:06:27,317 --> 00:06:30,520
Leave that out and come and see
what I've got you, eh?

71
00:06:30,612 --> 00:06:34,230
I've brought you a present.
This is our anniversary.

72
00:06:34,324 --> 00:06:37,942
Three months of mutual understanding,
eh, Richard?

73
00:06:38,036 --> 00:06:43,541
Three months since I first invited you
to be my favourite restaurateur.

74
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:47,160
Mr. Spica, this is a duck.

75
00:06:47,254 --> 00:06:49,709
Ducks are born with the feathers on

76
00:06:49,798 --> 00:06:52,419
but it's your dinner, Mr. Spica.

77
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:57,752
If you want the feathers to remain,
we could try the dish,

78
00:06:57,848 --> 00:07:01,892
I suppose,
by leaving the feathers as they are.

79
00:07:01,977 --> 00:07:04,135
Canard en ses plumes torche.

80
00:07:05,814 --> 00:07:08,103
Mitchel, you mule.

81
00:07:08,191 --> 00:07:10,682
'Ere, Richard, come and see, come on.

82
00:07:10,777 --> 00:07:13,981
Please, I beg you. Ha! Come on.

83
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,493
Georgina, how many times have I told you?
No smoking in the kitchen.

84
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:25,455
Mitchel, get your arse down here quick.
Come on.

85
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:30,963
Now, Richard, this is your...
well, our new sign.

86
00:07:31,048 --> 00:07:33,336
Da-da-da-da-da-da!

87
00:07:33,425 --> 00:07:36,094
Wallop!

88
00:07:42,434 --> 00:07:44,640
Oh, God!

89
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:48,055
Richard.

90
00:07:49,316 --> 00:07:52,566
- It's dark in the restaurant.
- Yes, Phillipe.

91
00:07:52,653 --> 00:07:57,113
Thanks to Mr. Spica's generosity,
it is dark everywhere.

92
00:07:59,534 --> 00:08:03,283
No power, no light.

93
00:08:04,414 --> 00:08:07,298
Were you thinking of
a cold buffet tonight?

94
00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:09,667
But I don't want a cold buffet.

95
00:08:09,753 --> 00:08:15,708
- Paté d'alouettes with a chicory sauce.
- Paté d'alouettes with a chicory sauce.

96
00:08:16,843 --> 00:08:20,711
- Terrine de caneton.
- Terrine de canton.

97
00:08:20,806 --> 00:08:26,725
- Cold turkey with lemon and basilica.
- Cold turkey with the lemon and basilica.

98
00:08:26,812 --> 00:08:28,851
Anchovies in garlic vinegar.

99
00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:32,937
It doesn't have to be cold,
you've got gas, for God's sake!

100
00:08:35,487 --> 00:08:39,236
Got an arse on her
like two greased watermelons in a sack.

101
00:08:39,324 --> 00:08:42,527
Cold chicken, paté d'alouettes,

102
00:08:42,619 --> 00:08:46,403
salade de langoustine,
gâteau de carottes et Gruyére...

103
00:08:46,498 --> 00:08:51,575
You. You put them electrics right, Mitchel.
Put them electrics right or...

104
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,709
You don't eat.

105
00:08:53,797 --> 00:08:55,837
You don't eat.

106
00:08:58,719 --> 00:09:01,388
I told you not to smoke.

107
00:09:02,848 --> 00:09:05,968
I should stand still,
Mr. Spica. Or who knows?

108
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:09,559
You might spoil something,
put your foot in something.

109
00:09:09,646 --> 00:09:14,604
So, a hot meal for tonight.
Something special, please. How about some...

110
00:09:14,693 --> 00:09:18,904
some, er, Les oh d'oeuvres,
er, gâteau au poivres,

111
00:09:18,989 --> 00:09:24,030
er, terrine et fillet lamb et poison Au er,
poi, poi...

112
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:27,654
- It's "Poisson".
- What did you say, Georgie?

113
00:09:27,748 --> 00:09:30,120
What did you say? What did you say?

114
00:09:31,168 --> 00:09:33,207
Poisson.

115
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,758
- Well, Mr. Spica, I hope you are hungry.
- Always. Get in there, boys.

116
00:09:47,643 --> 00:09:52,684
Go on, Georgie, go in there,
raise your skirts and warm my seat.

117
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,693
Eh, what do you think then, eh?
What do you...?

118
00:10:05,494 --> 00:10:09,278
If you spent as much money
on the meal, Mr. Spica,

119
00:10:09,373 --> 00:10:12,290
as you waste on the decor,

120
00:10:12,376 --> 00:10:17,002
your taste in good food must surely improve.

121
00:10:19,716 --> 00:10:24,259
You'll cheek me once too often, Boarst.
You rely on me, don't forget.

122
00:10:24,346 --> 00:10:28,509
Without me, you, a foreigner,
you wouldn't last long around here.

123
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,091
Look out there, see what I've brought you.

124
00:10:31,186 --> 00:10:34,970
Two vans full of good stuff,
just right for your kitchen.

125
00:10:35,065 --> 00:10:38,434
- I would not touch it.
- Why on earth not?

126
00:10:38,527 --> 00:10:42,821
I insist on buying my own food, Mr. Spica.

127
00:10:42,906 --> 00:10:46,073
Then I can be sure of its quality.

128
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:49,825
I represent quality round here,
my name is known for it.

129
00:10:49,913 --> 00:10:53,531
I offer quality and protection.

130
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:58,252
Protection against what,
I wonder, Mr. Spica? And whom?

131
00:10:58,338 --> 00:11:02,965
Protection, Boarst,
against the rash temper of my men.

132
00:11:04,219 --> 00:11:08,133
Against a sudden arrival of food poisoning.

133
00:11:08,849 --> 00:11:13,226
Against rats.
Against the public health inspector.

134
00:11:13,312 --> 00:11:17,855
If you are hungry tonight,
you are going to have to wait.

135
00:11:17,941 --> 00:11:22,069
Do up the third button
of your expensive jacket, Mr. Spica.

136
00:11:22,946 --> 00:11:29,031
You'll feel less empty inside, Mr. Spica.

137
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:31,444
You can't make me wait.

00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:58,303
No, you'd never get that close to a lady.
Who'd wanna get that close to you?

157
00:13:58,393 --> 00:14:02,771
- I wouldn't be interested in her fingers.
- I'd expect you to say that.

158
00:14:02,856 --> 00:14:07,068
You'd just whip it in, whip it out
and wipe it on your jacket.

159
00:14:07,152 --> 00:14:10,106
Look at your jacket, it's like a pig field.

160
00:14:10,197 --> 00:14:13,363
And your nails could do with a clean.
Show me.

161
00:14:14,326 --> 00:14:19,154
Gawd. Why can't I have some bloody quality
in my associates?

162
00:14:19,248 --> 00:14:23,660
From now on, anyone not properly dressed
for dinner will pay for it.

163
00:14:23,752 --> 00:14:27,584
I'll write lessons down for you.
Georgina can type them out.

164
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:33,547
"Notes For Gourmets". That's French
for a good eater, isn't it, Boarst? (Belches)

165
00:14:33,637 --> 00:14:37,848
- Gourmets don't belch.
- On the contrary, on the contrary. They do.

166
00:14:37,933 --> 00:14:40,969
It shows that you are enjoying a meal.

167
00:14:41,061 --> 00:14:45,189
Not with your fingers, Spangler!
That's all you understand -

168
00:14:45,274 --> 00:14:48,856
things you eat with your hands
whilst walking down the street.

169
00:14:48,944 --> 00:14:52,028
You told Mews to eat the
celery with his fingers.

170
00:14:52,114 --> 00:14:56,443
That's different, you dope.
And it's asparagus, not celery.

171
00:14:56,535 --> 00:15:00,399
What's the point of sinking
thousands into a restaurant

172
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,548
if you refuse to eat properly?

173
00:15:02,624 --> 00:15:06,456
- Tell him, Georgina.
- Tell him what?

174
00:15:06,545 --> 00:15:11,290
Just copy Georgina. She knows how to do it.
Cory, get Richard in here.

175
00:15:11,383 --> 00:15:16,009
I want my sign fixed up
and put on that wall over the kitchen door.

176
00:15:16,096 --> 00:15:20,639
If Richard was more interested in slogans,
he'd make more money, eh?

177
00:15:21,643 --> 00:15:23,885
- This place is too dark.
- (Belches)

178
00:15:23,979 --> 00:15:27,811
Could do with a respray.
Gold, it needs more gold.

179
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:30,391
How about gold and blue?

180
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,613
What do you think, Henry?
10,000 should do it - two months' takings.

181
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:39,531
You should get in there.
Boarst's prices are all over the place.

182
00:15:40,412 --> 00:15:44,873
His head's in the clouds.
Good cook. Brilliant cook!

183
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:49,751
Except he puts mushrooms on everything.
Henry, put that cigarette out.

184
00:15:49,838 --> 00:15:53,041
Do you mind if I eat whilst you smoke?

185
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:57,546
Gordon choked on a cigarette whilst eating -
burnt his epiglottis.

186
00:15:57,638 --> 00:16:01,635
Mitchel, you've got one.
And you don't keep it in your trousers.

187
00:16:03,226 --> 00:16:08,648
You don't put orange rind on the edge
of your plate, it goes there, you dolt!

188
00:16:08,732 --> 00:16:14,319
What you've got to realise is that
a clever cook puts unlikely things together

189
00:16:14,404 --> 00:16:18,023
like duck and orange,
like pineapple and ham.

190
00:16:18,116 --> 00:16:20,156
It's called artistry.

191
00:16:20,244 --> 00:16:24,490
I'm an artist, the way I combine
my business and my pleasure.

192
00:16:24,581 --> 00:16:26,989
Money's my business, eating's my pleasure.

193
00:16:27,084 --> 00:16:31,413
And Georgie's my pleasure too,
though in a more private kind of way

194
00:16:31,505 --> 00:16:35,337
than stuffing the mouth
and feeding the sewers.

195
00:16:35,425 --> 00:16:37,548
Though the pleasures are related,

196
00:16:37,636 --> 00:16:43,306
because the naughty bits and the dirty bits
are so close together

197
00:16:44,184 --> 00:16:48,811
that it just goes to show
how eating and sex are related.

198
00:16:48,897 --> 00:16:52,942
Georgie's naughty bits
are nicely related, aren't they?

199
00:16:53,026 --> 00:16:56,146
Especially when she's
paying me attention. Georgie.

200
00:16:56,238 --> 00:16:57,862
(Gasps)

201
00:16:57,948 --> 00:17:01,952
(Albert) Get Phillipe! In future, I want
my napkins folded at home, Georgina.

202
00:17:01,963 --> 00:17:03,297
Get Adele to teach you.

203
00:17:04,997 --> 00:17:07,404
Spangler, get up and get Phillipe.

204
00:17:07,499 --> 00:17:11,497
Bring Richard here,
I've got to make him a proposition.

205
00:17:11,587 --> 00:17:15,371
Get Adele to get that water
with the angostura bitters in it

206
00:17:15,465 --> 00:17:19,878
and some lemon in the water
and a bowl of ice water for me fingers...

207
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:24,715
Henry! Give me those glasses off that table.
And the flowers.

208
00:17:25,726 --> 00:17:28,762
This should look
the most important table here.

209
00:17:28,854 --> 00:17:32,305
I like a load of glasses around,
it highers the tone.

210
00:17:47,164 --> 00:17:48,288
What's that?

211
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:51,670
For Madame Spica,
compliments of the house.

212
00:17:51,752 --> 00:17:54,836
She's no Madame. Why haven't I got one?

213
00:17:54,922 --> 00:17:59,002
- I doubt, Mr. Spica, if you'll like it.
- Try me.

214
00:18:00,218 --> 00:18:04,430
We have grown accustomed
to you being a conservative eater.

215
00:18:04,514 --> 00:18:07,930
That's not true.
I'm as adventurous as the next.

216
00:18:08,018 --> 00:18:11,138
Your wife has an excellent palate, Mr. Spica.

217
00:18:11,229 --> 00:18:14,266
It is always a pleasure for us to serve her.

218
00:19:59,463 --> 00:20:02,409
(Albert)
I want one of those hot, damp towels,

219
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,550
Richard, served
to me with tongs.

220
00:20:05,636 --> 00:20:10,713
Adele is no good with cash and figures.
She's just decorative, all lips and tits.

221
00:20:10,807 --> 00:20:13,808
- We'll replace her.
- (Mitchel) Can I do the replacing?

222
00:20:13,894 --> 00:20:15,688
Stuff your mouth, Mitchel.

223
00:20:15,699 --> 00:20:19,907
Every time you open it,
you just show how vulgar you can be.

224
00:20:54,518 --> 00:20:57,056
(Albert) Georgina! Welcome back.

225
00:20:57,145 --> 00:21:00,894
Did you wipe the seat
before you parked your bum? (Laughs)

226
00:21:00,983 --> 00:21:03,882
You never know what you
can catch these days.

227
00:21:03,893 --> 00:21:06,034
Every toilet seat is a minefield.

228
00:21:06,113 --> 00:21:10,129
That's for you.
Richard thought I might like to taste it,

229
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,493
personal compliments of the chef.

230
00:21:12,578 --> 00:21:15,993
Eat it.
I didn't fancy it, it smelt off.

231
00:21:16,915 --> 00:21:20,000
Iris got a canker on her bum
from sitting on a loo seat.

232
00:21:20,085 --> 00:21:25,839
The mechanic across the road poured
battery acid down the WC to clear it.

233
00:21:27,342 --> 00:21:31,292
Some of it splashed on the seat.
Iris ran screaming into the street,

234
00:21:31,388 --> 00:21:33,464
her backside hissing.

235
00:21:33,557 --> 00:21:35,514
She hasn't been the same since.

236
00:21:35,601 --> 00:21:40,677
She strips the same
but never with her back to the audience.

237
00:21:40,772 --> 00:21:45,102
She had to change her act.
Now it's more full-frontal.

238
00:21:45,193 --> 00:21:48,397
- Where are you going?
- I left my lighter in the toilet.

239
00:21:48,488 --> 00:21:51,240
- Gawd's sake. You don't need it.
- I need it.

240
00:21:51,325 --> 00:21:56,567
Richard, I'm going to ban smoking in here.
Tomorrow, the signs are going up.

241
00:21:56,663 --> 00:22:00,032
You want to thicken your French accent
up a bit, mate,

242
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,616
like you've just come over from Paris.

243
00:22:02,711 --> 00:22:07,337
Give them a bit of that ooh-la-la stuff.
Bit more of that "parlez-vous français?"

244
00:22:07,424 --> 00:22:10,460
Then you would not understand me, Mr. Spica.

245
00:22:10,552 --> 00:22:14,799
I don't know. I've always been able
to understand French letters.

246
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,929
(Laughter)

247
00:23:30,716 --> 00:23:33,123
(Door opens)

248
00:23:40,642 --> 00:23:42,682
(Water running)

249
00:24:50,379 --> 00:24:52,122
(Door opens)

250
00:24:52,214 --> 00:24:54,123
Georgina!

251
00:24:54,216 --> 00:24:56,789
What the hell are you doing in here?

252
00:24:58,011 --> 00:25:00,681
Georgina?

253
00:25:00,764 --> 00:25:04,976
You've been in here for ages.
What are you doing, having a baby?

254
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,432
I'm, er, I'm just...

255
00:25:08,105 --> 00:25:12,185
- I'm just having a quiet smoke.
- Smoke?

256
00:25:14,152 --> 00:25:17,687
You know how you hate
me smoking at the table.

257
00:25:17,781 --> 00:25:20,272
Gawd's sake, Georgina.

258
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:23,321
Why tell me lies about a lost lighter?

259
00:25:23,412 --> 00:25:28,287
(Georgina) I didn't, I left it here
on the ledge in front of the mirror.

260
00:25:30,377 --> 00:25:32,666
I'll be out in a few moments.

261
00:25:32,754 --> 00:25:37,500
Don't hang around the ladies,
you'll embarrass the customers.

262
00:25:37,593 --> 00:25:39,632
Show me the lighter.

263
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,258
(Georgina) There.

264
00:25:44,516 --> 00:25:46,722
Do you want a cigarette as well?

265
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:49,218
Don't be so bloody stupid.

266
00:25:49,313 --> 00:25:53,560
What are you doing in there,
Georgina, eh? (Laughs)

267
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,773
You playing with yourself?

268
00:25:55,861 --> 00:26:00,570
That's not allowed, that's my property.
You're not allowed to fiddle with it.

269
00:26:00,657 --> 00:26:01,980
Shut up, Albert.

270
00:26:01,991 --> 00:26:05,958
Let me in, I'll show you
how to wipe yourself.

271
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,494
Go away. I'll be out in a minute.

272
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:12,537
Well, don't be long.

273
00:26:12,628 --> 00:26:16,791
I'll order you some gâteau aux poivres.

274
00:26:17,591 --> 00:26:19,963
Some profiteroles.

275
00:26:24,056 --> 00:26:26,179
And wash your hands.

276
00:26:27,267 --> 00:26:30,268
You don't know the women who use this place.

277
00:26:32,564 --> 00:26:35,233
- (Door closes)
- (Sighs)

278
00:27:32,207 --> 00:27:34,698
(Toilet flushes)

279
00:27:34,793 --> 00:27:36,833
(Sighs quietly)

280
00:27:39,506 --> 00:27:41,629
You took your time.

281
00:27:42,593 --> 00:27:45,262
I thought you'd like me to wait for you.

282
00:27:46,972 --> 00:27:49,214
You smell nice and sweaty.

283
00:27:49,308 --> 00:27:51,846
Wash your hands, I'll give you a kiss.

284
00:27:58,442 --> 00:28:00,481
(Water running)

285
00:28:06,909 --> 00:28:11,286
You know what they say about men
who hang around ladies' lavatories?

286
00:28:14,499 --> 00:28:18,711
What do they say about men
who hang around ladies' lavatories?

287
00:28:18,795 --> 00:28:21,954
They're asking to have
their illusions shattered.

288
00:28:21,965 --> 00:28:23,017
Yeah.

289
00:28:23,091 --> 00:28:26,377
You hold no illusions for me, Georgie, eh?

290
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:28,842
No stone's been left unturned.

291
00:28:28,931 --> 00:28:32,430
Look, just go order my profiteroles,
will you?

292
00:28:32,517 --> 00:28:34,759
Come on.

293
00:28:37,064 --> 00:28:39,103
Come on.

294
00:29:13,183 --> 00:29:15,223
(Laughter)

295
00:29:22,776 --> 00:29:26,192
I think these Ethiopians like starving.

296
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:31,156
It keeps them slim and graceful,
with those big heads and dreamy eyes.

297
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:32,791
You know those kids.

298
00:29:32,869 --> 00:29:34,144
(Georgina) You're sick.

299
00:29:34,155 --> 00:29:37,423
(Albert) I might well be
if you're being so priggish.

300
00:29:37,499 --> 00:29:41,213
(Woman) What do you know,
Georgina, about the starving?

301
00:29:41,224 --> 00:29:43,345
You can have anything you want.

302
00:29:43,422 --> 00:29:45,245
Where you been? You're late.

303
00:29:45,256 --> 00:29:48,770
It's Friday night.
There's a lot of money about.

304
00:29:50,095 --> 00:29:53,474
A decent man needs gloves
to touch this stuff.

305
00:29:53,485 --> 00:29:54,850
Let's have a look.

306
00:29:54,933 --> 00:29:57,851
That's just what this restaurant needs.

307
00:29:57,936 --> 00:30:00,641
- Start laying them out.
- (Belches)

308
00:30:00,731 --> 00:30:04,182
What's the matter, Mitchel?
Don't you like mussels?

309
00:30:04,276 --> 00:30:07,645
You got to learn to like them
if you're going to eat with me.

310
00:30:07,738 --> 00:30:10,311
Don't you dare throw up in here!

311
00:30:10,407 --> 00:30:13,906
Or I'll get Spangler to stuff 'em
back down your throat.

312
00:30:13,994 --> 00:30:16,376
(Cory)
From the Malay restaurant.

313
00:30:16,387 --> 00:30:19,959
The food poisoning scared them,
they're paying up.

314
00:30:20,042 --> 00:30:23,126
I'm sure they don't need
our assistance with that.

315
00:30:23,211 --> 00:30:26,627
That stuff they eat,
they'd poison themselves with it.

316
00:30:26,715 --> 00:30:31,092
Some of them Indians are well known
for drinking their own pee.

317
00:30:31,178 --> 00:30:34,926
The same water would go round and round.

318
00:30:35,015 --> 00:30:39,843
Of course, you're bound to lose some
through evaporation.

319
00:30:39,937 --> 00:30:44,314
Then you'd have to top it up.
Whose pee would you drink first?

320
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,603
- Erm...
- Me, I'd have a ready supply, wouldn't I?

321
00:30:47,694 --> 00:30:51,359
Georgie and I have
our little sessions when we...

322
00:30:51,448 --> 00:30:53,737
Good God, what have you got there?

323
00:30:53,825 --> 00:30:58,369
Even you are getting compliments
from the chef, are you?

324
00:30:58,455 --> 00:31:02,073
Being a guinea pig
for a Boarst experiment, are we?

325
00:31:02,167 --> 00:31:08,704
Good God, looks like, er,
food for constipated French rabbits.

326
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:13,591
Albert, why don't you order me some Chianti?
You know I like Chianti.

327
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,300
In the bottle with the wrapping around it.

328
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:19,593
Then I can take it home
and hang it on the wall.

329
00:31:19,685 --> 00:31:22,683
Grace, haven't you got
enough of them already?

330
00:31:22,694 --> 00:31:23,692
No.

331
00:31:23,772 --> 00:31:25,895
Where the hell are you going?

332
00:31:25,983 --> 00:31:29,601
- To the toilet.
- You haven't had anything to drink yet.

333
00:31:29,695 --> 00:31:33,823
She's got a bladder like a leaky marrow.
Don't be long!

334
00:31:33,907 --> 00:31:37,074
- You've upset her.
- Rubbish.

335
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:43,365
Don't be long! You're so talkative tonight,
we couldn't stand the silence without you.

336
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:46,749
Wash your hands!

337
00:32:05,981 --> 00:32:08,602
- Questo, questo.
- Cazzo.

338
00:32:08,692 --> 00:32:11,563
Dove hai imparato a cucinare?
É velenoso.

339
00:32:11,653 --> 00:32:13,895
Vieni qua.

340
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:31,956
That's off!

341
00:34:56,026 --> 00:34:58,065
Uh.

342
00:34:58,153 --> 00:35:02,103
- This custard's salty.
- It is sauce Hollandaise.

343
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:04,238
Can I help you, Mr. Spica?

344
00:35:04,326 --> 00:35:07,861
I've come about
those special complimentary dishes.

345
00:35:07,955 --> 00:35:11,703
In future, all the guests at my table
shall receive them.

346
00:35:11,792 --> 00:35:14,330
Why is my fish taking so long?

347
00:35:14,419 --> 00:35:17,753
You can carry it in yourself,
if you like, Mr. Spica.

348
00:35:19,299 --> 00:35:22,834
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing. You bring it.

349
00:35:22,928 --> 00:35:26,268
(Richard)
You would not be looking for your wife?

350
00:35:26,279 --> 00:35:27,814
No, of course not.

351
00:35:27,891 --> 00:35:30,975
Mr. Spica, I have something to show you.

352
00:35:44,074 --> 00:35:45,355
What is this?

353
00:35:45,366 --> 00:35:49,209
New cutlery.
Give your restaurant some style.

354
00:35:49,288 --> 00:35:53,866
I brought in 300 sets.
My men are just re-laying the tables.

355
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:59,042
Not very good quality, Mr. Spica.

356
00:36:00,132 --> 00:36:04,592
You could use them at home, Mr. Spica.

357
00:36:04,678 --> 00:36:07,430
All 300 of them.

358
00:36:44,176 --> 00:36:46,797
Where have you been? Wiping your bum?

359
00:36:46,887 --> 00:36:50,338
Did you use your left hand
like I showed you?

360
00:36:50,432 --> 00:36:54,264
Where'd you get this stuff, Mews?
It's rubbish, falling apart.

361
00:36:54,353 --> 00:36:59,180
Take 'em back.
Get a 150% refund. God.

362
00:37:00,692 --> 00:37:05,319
What are you eating, Georgie? Not much.

363
00:37:05,405 --> 00:37:10,151
Ha! I see others here
get the same special attentions.

364
00:37:10,244 --> 00:37:15,404
What is it? Looks like
some sort of... watery salade.

365
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:17,788
That's not up to much.

366
00:37:17,876 --> 00:37:20,996
Expensive, no doubt, but not fattening.

367
00:37:21,088 --> 00:37:24,504
You've got to keep your strength up,
you're looking peaky.

368
00:37:24,591 --> 00:37:27,711
Kidneys, liver, iron, that's what you need.

369
00:37:27,803 --> 00:37:33,971
Do you know a cow drinks
its own weight in water twice a week?

370
00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:38,768
For milk, you see,
because a cow's got great big tits.

371
00:37:38,855 --> 00:37:41,228
Just like you, eh, Georgie?

372
00:37:44,736 --> 00:37:48,781
You gentlemen will have to take it
for granted because

373
00:37:48,865 --> 00:37:52,400
for some reason best known to herself,

374
00:37:52,494 --> 00:37:54,652
she's left her bra off.

375
00:37:57,207 --> 00:37:59,876
Have you, Cory, ever tasted human milk?

376
00:38:00,794 --> 00:38:04,543
I mean recently.
All them years ago don't count.

377
00:38:04,631 --> 00:38:09,377
You couldn't really appreciate
what you were enjoying then, could you?

378
00:38:09,469 --> 00:38:15,424
I bet human milk's a great delicacy
in some countries. It ought to be here.

379
00:38:16,351 --> 00:38:20,052
Do you know, Cory, who could supply us
with some human milk?

380
00:38:20,147 --> 00:38:24,441
(Spangler)
Warm, straight from the receptacle, so to speak?

381
00:38:24,526 --> 00:38:28,606
Don't joke! It's a precious commodity,
not a joking matter!

382
00:38:28,697 --> 00:38:31,449
Georgie wouldn't joke about it, would you?

383
00:38:31,533 --> 00:38:33,609
Would you, Georgie?

384
00:38:33,702 --> 00:38:39,206
Ah. You're a credit to women. You could
show these young women a thing or two.

385
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:43,205
You could teach these young men
a thing or two. Take Mitchel.

386
00:38:43,295 --> 00:38:46,995
On second thoughts, don't,
cos he's a crude little bugger.

387
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:50,874
- Then how come you haven't got any kids?
- Kids?

388
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:56,381
Who needs kids? Who wants kids?

389
00:38:57,976 --> 00:39:00,514
I want kids.

390
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,560
We'll have kids one day, won't we, eh?

391
00:39:08,362 --> 00:39:11,731
When you're bloody old and grey, most like!

392
00:39:11,823 --> 00:39:15,489
Yeah. Your trouble is
you don't eat properly.

393
00:39:16,411 --> 00:39:20,575
You should drink more water
and eat more kidneys

394
00:39:20,666 --> 00:39:24,710
and then you might bloody well have
a bloody baby someday.

395
00:39:26,255 --> 00:39:29,006
Georgie doesn't like babies, do you?

396
00:39:29,091 --> 00:39:34,298
You know, sometimes, Georgie,
I think you behave like a bloke.

397
00:39:34,388 --> 00:39:36,427
What days are those, then, Albert?

398
00:39:36,515 --> 00:39:38,554
- What's it like?
- You what?

399
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:43,387
Get away from this table,
you mucky little wimp!

400
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:48,522
Go and eat your vegetable soup
in the kitchen, you dirty little pervert!

401
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:51,730
Go on, get on with your eating, eh?

402
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:55,025
It's only Mitchel making a fool of himself.

403
00:39:55,117 --> 00:39:58,118
Now, stand in the corner.
Cory, make him a paper hat.

404
00:39:58,203 --> 00:40:01,370
Stand in the corner
like a naughty little boy.

405
00:40:01,456 --> 00:40:04,790
Stand there.
Take your knife and fork with you.

406
00:40:04,876 --> 00:40:07,664
- Don't be stupid.
- Do you want to join him?

407
00:40:07,754 --> 00:40:12,613
Leave him alone. He's only
copying you like he always does.

408
00:40:12,624 --> 00:40:14,728
You behave, he'll behave.

409
00:40:14,803 --> 00:40:17,674
- I'm leaving.
- Yes, we are leaving.

410
00:40:17,764 --> 00:40:22,759
Gracie, here. Pay the bill and take a taxi.

411
00:40:23,729 --> 00:40:27,940
Yeah. Georgie and I
might go for a little drive.

412
00:40:29,776 --> 00:40:32,896
It's our wedding anniversary tomorrow.

413
00:40:32,988 --> 00:40:35,657
Might drive down to the sea,

414
00:40:35,741 --> 00:40:38,658
have some fun under the pier
like we used to.

415
00:40:49,129 --> 00:40:52,000
Oops. I am sorry.

416
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:55,958
Still, this isn't a library,
it's a restaurant.

417
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:58,092
They got people for that.

418
00:41:01,558 --> 00:41:03,598
Richard.

419
00:41:03,685 --> 00:41:08,015
This needs cooking.
Grill it with some mashed peas.

420
00:41:14,029 --> 00:41:16,271

That's woman's work,

My God, armour plating.
You protect yourself, son, you need it.

Innocence. That's what I had
before I met Georgie.

428
00:41:46,895 --> 00:41:50,311
- That's just what they want.

Sing for me, yes. Yes, you can sing for me.

Get up there. You sing, yeah.

Come on, now. You sing to me. Eh?

I was a choirboy once.

440
00:42:29,605 --> 00:42:32,689
Yes. Women like choirboys.

441
00:42:32,774 --> 00:42:36,439
I was almost a choirboy when I met Georgie.

442
00:42:36,528 --> 00:42:39,315
But you spoilt all that, didn't you?

443
00:42:39,406 --> 00:42:43,867
Georgie was a very good education,
she could teach a young man anything.

444
00:42:43,952 --> 00:42:48,365
Come on, Georgie, show the young boy
what you showed me.

445
00:42:48,457 --> 00:42:51,244
- Albert.
- Go on, show the little boy...

446
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:54,585
- Albert!
- You do what I tell you, will you?

447
00:42:55,672 --> 00:42:59,172
You come out in that car park with me,
both of you. Come on.

Out in the car park. Come on.

I'll give you the best education,

450
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:11,480
show you what a great
teacher Georgie can be.

- Don't touch him!

452
00:43:13,815 --> 00:43:18,062

(Albert) - I'll show you what a great teacher...

453
00:43:18,153 --> 00:43:23,230
Oh, I see. So I'm not supposed to do that?
I'll give you an education.

454
00:43:23,325 --> 00:43:25,863
- Albert, please leave him alone.
- Oh, no.

00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:30,870
- Just leave him be.
- Watch this.

457
00:43:30,958 --> 00:43:35,370
- No. Wait till we get home, Albert.
- Georgie. Georgie, come here.

458
00:43:35,462 --> 00:43:40,005
Right. What's all this?
You're not wearing any bloody knickers.

459
00:43:40,092 --> 00:43:43,626
You've been sitting in that restaurant
with no knickers on?

460
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:47,884
With Cory and Mitchel and all those people?
What's this mean?

461
00:43:47,975 --> 00:43:50,347
Where are they? Give them to me at once.

462
00:43:50,435 --> 00:43:54,765
Go on. Look at this.
Get in that car, you dirty whore.

463
00:43:54,856 --> 00:43:58,605
Why don't you take everything off?

464
00:43:58,694 --> 00:44:03,190
- Get in there. Go on! Get in that car!
- (Georgina gasping)

465
00:44:03,282 --> 00:44:07,030
- Now you! You get in there as well.
- No!

466
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,903
- Go on. Get in there. Get in.
- No! Please!

467
00:44:11,665 --> 00:44:15,330
- No! No! No!
- Get in there! Get in.

468
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:17,542
(exclaims in pain)

469
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:24,755

Do you know, Mitchel,
what prairie oysters are?

487
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:34,822
Fish.

488
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:39,406
So if someone feeds you a prairie oyster,
what would you be eating?

489
00:47:39,498 --> 00:47:43,578
Fish. Like from the lakes and that.
They're the...

490
00:47:43,669 --> 00:47:46,207
The clams with the little pearls in.

491
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:50,831
Prairie oysters would be very precious
to their owners. No.

492
00:47:50,926 --> 00:47:52,965
No, look. Imagine...

493
00:47:53,053 --> 00:47:57,217
Just imagine that this is a prairie oyster.

494
00:47:57,307 --> 00:48:01,471
Now, go on. Eat that. Go on.
Put it in your mouth. Go on. Go on.

495
00:48:01,561 --> 00:48:04,231
Now, what's it taste like?

496
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:08,689
- Wet bread.
- No.

497
00:48:08,777 --> 00:48:11,695
It's all squishy with gritty bits in it.

498
00:48:13,448 --> 00:48:15,737
That's the sand.

499
00:48:17,744 --> 00:48:20,662
That's the sand. You're a comic.

500
00:48:20,747 --> 00:48:24,412
No, you mule. It's got a skin round it.

501
00:48:27,629 --> 00:48:29,788
- Do you spit the skin out?
- No.

502
00:48:29,881 --> 00:48:33,085
Pick it out of your teeth afterwards,
chump it up.

503
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:36,343
Now, swallow that, go on, swallow it.
Swallow it.

504
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:38,469
Go on, that's right.

505
00:48:38,557 --> 00:48:42,804
Now, Mitchel, you have just eaten
a sheep's bollock.

506
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,769
The next time I ask you
to work for me, Mitchel,

507
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:55,812
I'll be expecting you to chew
someone's bollocks off on demand.

508
00:48:57,618 --> 00:48:59,657
Oh, you're back.

509
00:48:59,745 --> 00:49:03,079
What do you find in that toilet
that's so fascinating?

510
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:05,211
I'll go and have a pee and a look.

511
00:49:05,292 --> 00:49:08,155
What have they got
since I was last in there?

512
00:49:08,166 --> 00:49:10,343
Velvet seats, dirty pictures?
Hah.

513
00:49:10,422 --> 00:49:14,040
Free perfume? A private drinks bar?

514
00:49:44,873 --> 00:49:47,660
Cor, what a disgusting smell in here!

515
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:51,535
Must be the pigs using it, eh?
How disgusting it is.

516
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:55,793
Ha! Urgh, how horrible. Disgusting.

517
00:49:55,884 --> 00:49:59,170
Revolting place, needs airing out.
What's this?

518
00:49:59,263 --> 00:50:01,718
Gaw, phwoar, phwoar...

519
00:50:02,849 --> 00:50:07,808
Look. "There was a young man from Uckinham
who got caught while he was..."

520
00:50:07,896 --> 00:50:12,273
That is disgusting!
People ought to be locked up for that.

521
00:50:12,359 --> 00:50:15,526
Absolutely appalling.
Not what I'm used to at all.

522
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:19,195
It's disgraceful.
Don't you reckon, don't you think?

523
00:50:19,283 --> 00:50:21,489
Yes. God.

524
00:50:21,577 --> 00:50:24,780
- 'Ere, what are you looking at?
- What are you talking about?

525
00:50:24,871 --> 00:50:29,249
Don't pretend. You're waiting
for my young associates, aren't you?

526
00:50:29,334 --> 00:50:32,584
A man ought to be able to piss
without harassment.

527
00:50:32,671 --> 00:50:35,707
- How dare you? I'm getting the manager.
- I am the manager.

528
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:39,963
And you are out on the street.
Caught loitering in a toilet.

529
00:50:40,053 --> 00:50:42,544
- Ow!
- Yeah.

530
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:47,930
That's what these people need.
Short, sharp, shock treatment.

531
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,649
Hello. What are you doing? Reading again?

532
00:50:57,738 --> 00:50:59,122
This is not a library.

533
00:50:59,133 --> 00:51:02,908
The only thing you're allowed
to read in here is the menu.

534
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:05,531
You are insulting the chef.

535
00:51:05,621 --> 00:51:08,871
Reading gives you indigestion,
didn't you know that?

536
00:51:08,957 --> 00:51:11,282
Don't read at the table.

537
00:51:13,629 --> 00:51:17,496
I've just been reading stuff
to make your hair curl.

538
00:51:17,591 --> 00:51:19,833
Out there, in the toilet.

539
00:51:19,927 --> 00:51:23,130
That's the sort of stuff
people read, not this.

540
00:51:23,221 --> 00:51:25,677
Don't you feel out of touch?

541
00:51:25,766 --> 00:51:28,221
Does this stuff make money?

542
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:32,853
You know, I bet you're
the only man who's read this book.

543
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:36,605
But I bet you every man here
has read that stuff out there.

544
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:39,315
It makes you think, doesn't it?

545
00:51:39,404 --> 00:51:43,734
You know, I reckon you read
because you got nobody to talk to.

546
00:51:43,825 --> 00:51:48,452
I tell you what. So you shouldn't eat alone,
why don't you come and join us?

547
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:50,780
Come and meet my wife.

548
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:52,623
(Laughs) She's seen you.

549
00:51:52,634 --> 00:51:56,424
I know she's sorry for you
sitting here all alone.

550
00:51:56,505 --> 00:52:01,665
She likes to read too.
She spends hours sitting on the bed reading.

551
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,381
She even reads on the john.

552
00:52:11,603 --> 00:52:13,845
This is Cory.

553
00:52:15,857 --> 00:52:20,318
This is Mitchel.
He can't read, can you, Mitchel?

554
00:52:20,404 --> 00:52:23,607
- Yes, I can.
- Yeah. Comics and dirty magazines.

555
00:52:24,449 --> 00:52:28,317
And this is Georgina. She is my wife.

556
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:32,072
What's your name?

557
00:52:33,166 --> 00:52:34,343
Michael.

558
00:52:34,354 --> 00:52:37,885
Well, Michael.
Is that a Jewish name, Michael?

559
00:52:37,963 --> 00:52:39,801
Do you eat kosher food, Michael?

560
00:52:39,812 --> 00:52:43,429
Sit down, Michael, and tell us
all about kosher food, Michael.

561
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:46,546
- I'm sorry but I'm not Jewish.
- Why hide it?

562
00:52:46,638 --> 00:52:51,217
60% of the people in this restaurant
are a touch Jewish, Michael.

563
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:53,551
Richard, set another place for Michael.

564
00:52:53,645 --> 00:52:58,853
He is Jewish, so maybe you could find him
some spare ribs. No pork.

565
00:53:00,068 --> 00:53:01,673
He won't need those.

566
00:53:01,684 --> 00:53:05,535
We're going to hold a conversation,
aren't we?

567
00:53:05,616 --> 00:53:09,530
You can start, Georgie.
Tell Michael all about yourself.

568
00:53:10,495 --> 00:53:13,340
I'm sure your wife would
rather eat in peace.

569
00:53:13,351 --> 00:53:14,835
No. Talk, Georgina.

570
00:53:14,917 --> 00:53:18,665
Here's your chance
to improve your table conversation.

571
00:53:18,754 --> 00:53:20,877
Tell Michael you live in a big house

572
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:23,716
and you spend £400 a week on clothes.

573
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,876
I spend £400 a week on clothes.

574
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:29,303
You have a petrol allowance of £40 a week.

575
00:53:29,389 --> 00:53:33,221
I have a petrol allowance of £40 a week,
which I never use.

576
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:36,145
- You wear beautiful things.
- I wear beautiful things.

577
00:53:36,229 --> 00:53:39,563
- You eat in the best restaurants.
- I eat in the best restaurants.

578
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:42,437
Georgina, try a little harder, please.

579
00:53:44,655 --> 00:53:48,320
- I go to a good hairdresser.
- Yes, the best there is.

580
00:53:48,408 --> 00:53:52,488
- I go to a good dentist.
- Yes, yeah, oh, yeah. He's Jewish.

581
00:53:52,579 --> 00:53:55,865
- I go to a good gynaecologist.
- You what?

582
00:53:55,958 --> 00:53:58,641
Who says it's unlikely
I'll ever have a baby.

583
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,926
Michael doesn't want to know that.

584
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:04,456
That the three miscarriages
have ruined my insides.

585
00:54:04,549 --> 00:54:08,132
That isn't true,
Michael doesn't need to know that.

586
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:11,247
Now, drink up, Michael,
let's talk about you.

587
00:54:11,258 --> 00:54:12,310
What do you do?

588
00:54:14,685 --> 00:54:17,057
I'm a gynaecologist.

589
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,683
- You're a what?
- You could always come and see me.

590
00:54:21,775 --> 00:54:24,348
We don't need to discuss that subject.

591
00:54:24,444 --> 00:54:28,276
Being infertile makes me a safe bet
for a good screw.

592
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:30,488
Shut up, Georgie!

593
00:54:33,996 --> 00:54:36,617
I must apologise for my wife, Michael.

594
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,247
If you don't get back to your table,
you're in danger of losing it.

595
00:54:42,337 --> 00:54:44,413
The place gets very full about now.

596
00:54:44,506 --> 00:54:49,049
Mitchel, take Michael back to his table.
Tell him about horses.

597
00:54:49,136 --> 00:54:51,841
Oh, it's all right, Mr. Spica, thank you.

598
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:55,262
I prefer to read my book.

599
00:54:56,101 --> 00:54:58,639
Besides, I've finished. Thank you.

600
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:03,479
Thank you for introducing me to your wife.

601
00:55:03,567 --> 00:55:06,568
I like your name.

602
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,699
(Georgina) Ah.

603
00:56:00,249 --> 00:56:02,662
What the hell do you think you're doing? Eh?

604
00:56:02,673 --> 00:56:04,173
(Knife being sharpened)

605
00:56:04,253 --> 00:56:10,421
Telling a complete stranger
intimate details about us?

606
00:56:10,509 --> 00:56:13,130
It's not about us. It's about me.

607
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:15,758
It's about us!

608
00:56:15,847 --> 00:56:19,347
And what's all this,
how much time you spend in that loo?

609
00:56:19,434 --> 00:56:22,554
What's all this about a gynaecologist?
Who is he?

610
00:56:22,646 --> 00:56:24,225
It'd better be a she.

611
00:56:24,236 --> 00:56:27,995
I don't want some bloke
fingering my wife about.

612
00:56:28,068 --> 00:56:31,318
It's a man. He's Jewish.

613
00:56:31,405 --> 00:56:35,817
- And he's from Ethiopia.
- What?

614
00:56:35,909 --> 00:56:39,859
His mother is a Roman Catholic,
he's been in prison in South Africa,

615
00:56:39,997 --> 00:56:44,041
he's as black as the ace of spades
and probably drinks his own pee.

616
00:56:44,126 --> 00:56:46,368
- Take that, you bitch!
- Oh!

617
00:56:46,461 --> 00:56:50,245
You lying, ungrateful bitch!
You get in that car.

618
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:52,878
It's the doghouse for you, you bitch.

619
00:56:52,968 --> 00:56:57,926
Bloody gynaecologist. Blasted gynaecologist.

620
00:56:58,015 --> 00:57:00,588
(Dogs barking)

621
00:57:00,684 --> 00:57:02,890
Get up. Get up.

622
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:08,225
Get in the car, you slag.

623
00:57:09,568 --> 00:57:11,726
Get in there. Go on.

624
00:57:14,823 --> 00:57:16,863
Yeah.

625
00:57:18,285 --> 00:57:20,324
(Dogs yelp)

626
00:57:42,684 --> 00:57:44,724
(Albert) Maiser came here.

627
00:57:44,811 --> 00:57:49,687
And Trelawny with his black lady friends
who wore peaches in their hair.

628
00:57:49,775 --> 00:57:51,981
- (Woman) Peaches?
- Imitation.

629
00:57:52,069 --> 00:57:56,731
And the Austrian brothers sat by the door -
high-wire professionals.

630
00:57:56,823 --> 00:57:59,196
Great balancers, sloppy with money.

631
00:57:59,284 --> 00:58:06,497
And Tim Tranter drank soup here out of a
cup with a straw when his jaw was broken.

632
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:11,826
There used to be a mark up there
where Goshy Capps threw a plate of kippers.

633
00:58:11,922 --> 00:58:14,543
- Kippers?
- Yes, kippers, for God's sake.

634
00:58:14,633 --> 00:58:17,005
(Woman) You wouldn't find kippers here.

635
00:58:17,094 --> 00:58:21,091
- They serve kippers for breakfast here.
- (Man) You've had breakfast here?

636
00:58:21,181 --> 00:58:24,217
The ferryman and his lady
ate here every morning.

637
00:58:24,309 --> 00:58:28,687
The ferryman was a poofter.
And fish disagreed with him.

638
00:58:28,772 --> 00:58:33,149
- Who are all these people?
- Small-time crooks and pimps...

639
00:58:33,235 --> 00:58:36,520
Boarst painted it out.
I'll get him to paint it back again.

640
00:58:36,613 --> 00:58:40,397
...gigolos, busted boxers, cheap whores...

641
00:58:40,492 --> 00:58:42,781
(Albert) I've got the clippings at home.

642
00:58:42,869 --> 00:58:45,989
...bullies, hairdressers, faggots.

643
00:58:46,081 --> 00:58:48,654
- (Albert) Robin Hoods.
- No, just hoods.

644
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:53,993
(Albert) You're getting very smart.
(Cory) Smart? Even his slang's out of date.

645
00:58:54,089 --> 00:58:57,624
(Albert) Now I'm the clientele,
you understand? Me.

646
00:58:57,718 --> 00:59:01,715
And Georgie here and Cory Peterson.
The coq Au Vin is good.

647
00:59:01,805 --> 00:59:05,933
(Man) Cock a what?
(Albert) Chicken cooked in wine, you mule.

648
00:59:06,018 --> 00:59:10,478
- Bess Riddle lived on coq Au Vin.
- (Man) More of the coq than the Vin.

649
00:59:10,564 --> 00:59:11,501
(Grace laughing)

650
00:59:11,512 --> 00:59:14,322
(Albert)
Starkie, there are ladies present.

651
00:59:14,401 --> 00:59:18,315
- Or there were. Where's she gone?
- Gracie's no lady, are you?

652
00:59:18,405 --> 00:59:21,739
- (Grace) She must have a bladder infection.
- She's one of us.

653
00:59:21,825 --> 00:59:25,657
(Albert) There's nothing wrong
except she disappears to the John.

654
00:59:25,746 --> 00:59:29,197
(Man) And which of the bladder infections
do you have, Starkie?

655
00:59:29,291 --> 00:59:31,580
(Man) Ladies go to the toilet, not the john.

656
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:36,081
Real ladies don't go to the toilet,
they go to the bathroom.

657
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:40,672
- (Mitchel) Boarst hasn't got a bathroom.
- (Albert) Shut your mouth.

658
00:59:40,761 --> 00:59:45,090
You'd pee in your pants
before you'd recognise a respectable WC.

659
00:59:53,607 --> 00:59:56,643
So, he's broken the silence for us

660
00:59:58,153 --> 01:00:00,311
and your name is Georgina.

661
01:00:02,574 --> 01:00:07,366
Yes. And don't ever call me Georgie.

662
01:00:09,331 --> 01:00:11,952
You have beautiful eyes, Georgina.

663
01:00:16,338 --> 01:00:20,549
And you have a beautiful prick,
Mr. Gynaecologist.

664
01:00:21,677 --> 01:00:26,089
- I have?
- Yes, whatever its racist beliefs.

665
01:00:29,643 --> 01:00:33,391
- Your husband is a curiosity.
- He is?

666
01:00:38,485 --> 01:00:40,893
Why?

667
01:00:40,988 --> 01:00:43,111
Why what?

668
01:00:45,784 --> 01:00:47,860
Why am I married to him?

669
01:00:50,581 --> 01:00:52,620
Why aren't you married?

670
01:00:52,708 --> 01:00:55,329
- How do you know I'm not?
- You're not.

671
01:00:58,130 --> 01:01:00,336
- I'm not.
- Why?

672
01:01:05,679 --> 01:01:09,041
I once saw a film in which the
main character didn't speak

673
01:01:09,052 --> 01:01:10,647
for the first half an hour.

674
01:01:10,726 --> 01:01:12,037
Like us?

675
01:01:12,048 --> 01:01:15,979
Do all the minutes we've been together
add up to half an hour?

676
01:01:18,692 --> 01:01:24,315
I was completely absorbed as to what would
happen because anything was possible.

677
01:01:25,824 --> 01:01:28,529
And then?

678
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:31,785
He spoilt it - he spoke.

679
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:37,289
- And?
- Within five minutes, I'd lost interest.

680
01:01:38,962 --> 01:01:43,589
So now you've opened your mouth,
do you expect me to lose interest?

681
01:01:45,218 --> 01:01:47,460
It was only a film.

682
01:01:52,225 --> 01:01:55,511
Erm, now, we've been talking for one minute.

683
01:01:56,688 --> 01:02:00,223
We've got four minutes left
before you lose interest.

684
01:02:00,317 --> 01:02:02,855
Four minutes. That's enough.

685
01:02:02,945 --> 01:02:05,103
Where's the bomb?

686
01:02:05,197 --> 01:02:12,658
He's, er... He's eating
avocado vinaigrette and prawns.

687
01:02:13,914 --> 01:02:16,037
With his fingers.

688
01:02:17,876 --> 01:02:19,916
Kiss me.

689
01:02:24,383 --> 01:02:29,424
- Your restaurant's noisy, Spica.
- It's popular on a Sunday night.

690
01:02:29,513 --> 01:02:32,348
I like a quiet restaurant, with floor shows.

691
01:02:32,432 --> 01:02:36,264
Boarst is a culinary artist,
not a fancy entertainer.

692
01:02:36,353 --> 01:02:39,971
But we're here to please you, Terry.
We'll get you a floor show.

693
01:02:40,065 --> 01:02:44,312
Cory, phone Santini. Five girls - strippers.

694
01:02:44,403 --> 01:02:47,404
Make it decent, will you?
My daughter's present.

695
01:02:47,489 --> 01:02:51,487
Five dancing girls with music.
Strictly no filth, only class.

696
01:02:51,577 --> 01:02:54,696
And make it quiet.
I want to keep my ears till I'm 90.

697
01:02:54,788 --> 01:02:59,367
God, Terry, what sort of floor show
do you like? Mute nuns?

698
01:02:59,459 --> 01:03:03,623
If they call me Mr. Fitch, I might.
I'm only Terry to my wife, Spica.

699
01:03:03,714 --> 01:03:06,999
- Like me.
- You're Terry and all, are you?

700
01:03:07,092 --> 01:03:10,924
- I'm only Albert to Georgina.
- Even when she's in the loo?

701
01:03:11,013 --> 01:03:14,547
- Shut your whore up, Cory!
- God, you're noisy, Spica.

702
01:03:14,641 --> 01:03:18,556
Makes for indigestion.
Don't you find, love? What's your name?

703
01:03:18,645 --> 01:03:20,021
Patricia, Mr. Fitch.

704
01:03:20,105 --> 01:03:24,150
Are you a good dancer?
You look as if you might be a good dancer.

705
01:03:24,234 --> 01:03:28,232
We'd like to see you get up
and dance, with Geoff.

706
01:03:28,322 --> 01:03:30,563
Geoff's a very good dancer.

707
01:03:30,657 --> 01:03:34,358
- There's no dancing allowed.
- I always eat at home.

708
01:03:34,453 --> 01:03:36,944
- Best place.
- No food poisoning.

709
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:42,080
Ricky Boarst is as safe as houses.
He keeps a very clean kitchen, go and see.

710
01:03:42,169 --> 01:03:44,327
I'd like to see.

711
01:03:44,421 --> 01:03:49,878
- Mitchel, take the lady to see the kitchen.
- I'll take her myself, Spica.

712
01:03:52,971 --> 01:03:56,138
- Show me the way.
- Through that door.

713
01:03:56,224 --> 01:04:00,388
I'll call in the bathroom
and send Georgie back tout de suite.

714
01:04:00,479 --> 01:04:02,685
That means immediately.

715
01:04:02,773 --> 01:04:07,351
- Your new girlfriend's cheap, Cory.
- She's only practising her French.

716
01:04:07,444 --> 01:04:09,852
It's a French restaurant, isn't it?

717
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:36,425
Someone's having pheasant for dinner.

718
01:04:36,515 --> 01:04:38,554
(Georgina laughs)

719
01:04:41,853 --> 01:04:45,139
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

720
01:04:46,149 --> 01:04:50,194
We could be interrupted, um... 700 times.

721
01:04:51,947 --> 01:04:55,306
What's your boyfriend
paying you, Patricia?

722
01:04:55,317 --> 01:04:57,912
Paying me? He doesn't pay me.

723
01:04:57,995 --> 01:05:00,912
He buys me meals and drinks.

724
01:05:00,998 --> 01:05:04,034
- Doesn't he give you no pocket money?
- No.

725
01:05:04,126 --> 01:05:07,826
Nothing for a tuna fish sandwich
late at night or a bottle of gin

726
01:05:07,921 --> 01:05:11,207
- to make you forget what you had for lunch?
- No.

727
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:14,669
(Sniffs) Phew, it stinks here.

728
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:20,590
Listen, how about if...

729
01:05:20,684 --> 01:05:22,842
if I gave you some pocket money?

730
01:05:24,187 --> 01:05:26,227
What do I have to do to earn it?

731
01:05:47,753 --> 01:05:50,504
OK, here they are. Where's Fitch?

732
01:05:51,381 --> 01:05:54,133
Phillipe, clear those tables.
We need more space.

733
01:05:54,217 --> 01:05:57,337
- But Mr. Spica, they are eating.
- Move them.

734
01:05:57,429 --> 01:06:01,593
You are in the way of the floor show.
You're gonna have to move.

735
01:06:01,683 --> 01:06:03,806
We're in the middle of our meal.

736
01:06:03,894 --> 01:06:08,556
If you're going to eat quite quickly,
you can finish your soup.

737
01:06:09,399 --> 01:06:13,018
After all, you don't want
to get trampled on, do you?

738
01:06:14,279 --> 01:06:16,486
Hold him. Hold him.

739
01:06:16,573 --> 01:06:18,696
(Gasping, screaming)

740
01:06:19,826 --> 01:06:22,448
It's a pity you didn't take my advice.

741
01:06:22,537 --> 01:06:25,989
All that lovely food.
Richard will be disappointed.

742
01:06:26,083 --> 01:06:32,038
Now, you're gonna have to eat in the kitchen
like naughty little children, eh?

743
01:06:32,130 --> 01:06:34,586
Hey, what is your name?

744
01:06:34,675 --> 01:06:38,340
What did you say?
Did I hear you say William?

745
01:06:38,428 --> 01:06:42,343
Well, naughty little Willie,
tiny little Willie,

746
01:06:42,432 --> 01:06:45,801
how would you like
to be spanked on your big, fat bottom?

747
01:06:45,894 --> 01:06:47,934
(Gasping)

748
01:06:54,403 --> 01:06:59,278
Seeing as you're so keen
on Richard's mushrooms, William,

749
01:06:59,366 --> 01:07:04,491
you, I'm gonna give you five,
the count of five

750
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:08,447
and I want to see you
on the way to the kitchen

751
01:07:08,542 --> 01:07:10,618
or you'll be out in the street!

752
01:07:10,711 --> 01:07:12,750
Get out.

753
01:07:15,007 --> 01:07:17,046
(Shouting)

754
01:07:19,469 --> 01:07:21,509
(Screaming)

755
01:07:22,598 --> 01:07:25,552

He likes you, though you look like a bloke.

- Perhaps he likes blokes.
- None of that homosexual talk.

Yesterday evening's got my name on it.

- Don't do that to a woman.

- That's your trouble.

- Georgie and that Jew.

- That bloke who sits over there, reading.

01:17:31,707 --> 01:17:33,830
Quickly. Quick.

913
01:17:52,519 --> 01:17:55,354
No. No. No, no.

914
01:17:55,439 --> 01:17:58,523
No, please. Aah! No.

915
01:18:04,114 --> 01:18:06,154
(Flies buzzing)

916
01:18:06,241 --> 01:18:08,364
(Georgina sobbing)

917
01:18:20,130 --> 01:18:22,170
(Georgina gasping)

918
01:19:36,373 --> 01:19:38,413
(Creaking)

919
01:19:39,751 --> 01:19:42,077
What is this place?

920
01:19:42,170 --> 01:19:45,171
It's a book depository.

921
01:19:45,257 --> 01:19:49,255
When my bookshop is quiet,
I do a stocktaking job.

922
01:19:50,679 --> 01:19:53,882
I'm cataloguing French history.

923
01:19:57,477 --> 01:20:00,265
There's a kitchen and a bathroom.

924
01:20:00,355 --> 01:20:04,483
It's a bit primitive but there's
an extraordinary view.

925
01:20:04,568 --> 01:20:06,940
Have you read all these books?

926
01:20:07,029 --> 01:20:09,152
No.

927
01:20:09,239 --> 01:20:15,028
It's not necessary
for the book-keeper to read all the stock.

928
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:18,287
With a job like this,
you could be very boring.

929
01:20:20,709 --> 01:20:22,915
Are we safe here?

930
01:20:25,464 --> 01:20:27,540
Does Albert read?

931
01:20:27,633 --> 01:20:29,672
No.

932
01:20:32,346 --> 01:20:35,097
If you don't read, does that make you safe?

933
01:20:35,182 --> 01:20:37,388
Only from bad books.

934
01:20:39,269 --> 01:20:42,270
You could spend a lifetime in here reading.

935
01:20:42,356 --> 01:20:48,892
You could. Two lifetimes - yours and mine.

936
01:20:48,987 --> 01:20:51,525
- Is that what I'm in for?
- No.

937
01:20:56,662 --> 01:21:00,742
What good are all these books to you?
You can't eat them.

938
01:21:00,832 --> 01:21:03,668
How can they make you happy?

939
01:21:03,752 --> 01:21:06,623
I've always found them very reasonable.

940
01:21:06,713 --> 01:21:09,999
They don't change their minds
when you're not looking.

941
01:21:10,092 --> 01:21:12,796
That sounds like a disadvantage to me.

942
01:21:15,305 --> 01:21:17,428
Kiss me.

Do you agree, until later, maybe?

950
01:21:45,335 --> 01:21:47,826
How is the restaurant?

951
01:21:47,921 --> 01:21:52,215
- It's all right.
- And Richard? Mr. Boarst?

952
01:21:52,301 --> 01:21:54,542
He's fine.

953
01:21:56,138 --> 01:21:59,174
Is there any more trouble,

954
01:22:00,017 --> 01:22:02,258
er, like last night?

955
01:22:02,352 --> 01:22:05,139
- No, sir.
- Would you like to join us?

956
01:22:08,859 --> 01:22:12,559
No, thank you.
I'll eat later with Mr. Boarst.

957
01:22:26,877 --> 01:22:28,916
Enjoy your meal.

958
01:22:29,004 --> 01:22:31,043
Thank you.

959
01:22:35,385 --> 01:22:41,388
Erm, have you any other news to tell us?

960
01:22:42,351 --> 01:22:47,974
Mr. Boarst says...
He told me to tell you to stay put

961
01:22:48,065 --> 01:22:51,730
and he wishes you bon appétit.

962
01:22:51,818 --> 01:22:53,858
Thank you.

963
01:23:01,536 --> 01:23:04,740
When you're finished,
I'm to take the dishes back.

964
01:23:05,707 --> 01:23:12,077
Oh, if you find any of those books
interesting, you can borrow them.

965
01:23:43,829 --> 01:23:46,154
Wa-woo! Di-Di-Di-Di-dah-da!

966
01:23:50,168 --> 01:23:52,208
(Dogs barking)

967
01:23:56,049 --> 01:23:58,884
All right, where are they? Where are they?

968
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:02,555
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

969
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:07,385
I don't suppose you ate all this yourself.
What have we got in here? Let's see. Ah.

970
01:24:07,477 --> 01:24:11,807
Fish sauce with mayonnaise
and a touch of basil. I like basil.

971
01:24:11,898 --> 01:24:14,354
What else we got in here? Aha.

972
01:24:14,443 --> 01:24:18,061
It's sticky. Don't tell me.
Chocolate sauce - profiteroles.

973
01:24:18,155 --> 01:24:21,191
Georgina liked profiteroles.

974
01:24:21,825 --> 01:24:26,119
Oh, and serviettes
with Georgina's lipstick on them.

975
01:24:26,204 --> 01:24:29,075
And a nice bottle of wine. Very nice.

976
01:24:29,166 --> 01:24:32,250
He's for the chop, Richard.
I'll get my hands on him.

977
01:24:32,336 --> 01:24:36,832
Leave that bread roll alone. I need to know
where they are. Where are they? Eh?

978
01:24:36,924 --> 01:24:42,298
Ah. Ah. That's good.
Open your mouth. Come on, open it.

979
01:24:42,387 --> 01:24:46,136
- Take an interest in your food.
- (Mews) We don't need to do this.

980
01:24:46,224 --> 01:24:49,640
- Getting squeamish?
- He's just a kid.

981
01:24:49,728 --> 01:24:53,726
- Stand him up and get his trousers down.
- Leave him alone.

982
01:24:53,815 --> 01:24:59,320
Get out. Who needs fairies like you?
And take your four-eyed cousin with you.

983
01:24:59,404 --> 01:25:04,909
See how you get on in the streets without
me to wipe your noses. Get lost! Righto.

984
01:25:04,993 --> 01:25:08,327
OK, button eater, tell me where they are.

985
01:25:08,413 --> 01:25:10,453
(Screaming)

986
01:25:12,251 --> 01:25:14,706
OK, button eater, where are they?

987
01:25:15,963 --> 01:25:20,256
We've run out of buttons.
But there is one more button.

988
01:25:20,342 --> 01:25:23,758
It's your belly button.
How'd you like to swallow that?

989
01:25:23,845 --> 01:25:26,087
- Albert!
- You still here?

990
01:25:26,181 --> 01:25:29,052
- (Shrieking)
- Well, then, watch this.

991
01:25:37,234 --> 01:25:41,812
Wake him up! Wake him up, wake him up.
I must find out where she is!

992
01:25:41,905 --> 01:25:43,945
Wake him up!

993
01:25:44,950 --> 01:25:46,989
Wake him up!

994
01:25:48,036 --> 01:25:52,912
Where are they?
If he comes to, he better start to talk.

995
01:26:00,507 --> 01:26:03,128
(Albert laughs) I got 'em!

996
01:26:48,555 --> 01:26:50,762
I have brought your dinner.

997
01:26:59,399 --> 01:27:01,807
(Whispers) Where's the kitchen lad?

998
01:27:01,902 --> 01:27:05,686
- He is in hospital.
- What?

999
01:27:09,159 --> 01:27:13,786
He said he told them nothing
and I believe him.

1000
01:27:13,872 --> 01:27:18,084
- I must see him.
- (Richard) I don't think that's wise.

1001
01:27:18,168 --> 01:27:20,208
I'm coming.

1002
01:27:21,046 --> 01:27:23,619
You must take me to him.

1003
01:27:23,715 --> 01:27:27,084
- Start packing.
- (Michael) What have we got to pack?

1004
01:27:28,428 --> 01:27:31,762
Richard. Richard, bring that for Pup.

1005
01:27:31,848 --> 01:27:35,431
What can you do? You only endanger yourself.

1006
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:39,309
I'll only be gone an hour.

1007
01:27:39,398 --> 01:27:42,601
Richard, you can bring me back, can't you?

1008
01:27:44,653 --> 01:27:48,271
Oh, poor Pup. Oh, poor Pup.

1009

(Sobs)

1010

Of course.

then you strip off the legs.

1067
01:32:47,331 --> 01:32:54,413
And then you poke out
the soft part of the body.

1068
01:32:54,504 --> 01:32:58,205
- You turn the light out?
- (Mitchel) What light?

1069
01:32:58,967 --> 01:33:03,676
Idiot. You wouldn't remember to fart.
Place might burn down with all them books.

1070
01:33:03,764 --> 01:33:08,426
- That would nicely destroy the evidence.
- I don't want it destroyed, idiot!

1071
01:33:08,518 --> 01:33:10,345
I want Georgina to see it.

1072
01:34:13,083 --> 01:34:15,241
What did he say?

1073
01:34:15,335 --> 01:34:19,547
The French Revolution
was easier to swallow than Napoleon.

1074
01:34:19,631 --> 01:34:23,380
Napoleon was a prat. He wasted everything,
he threw everything away.

1075
01:34:23,468 --> 01:34:28,843
Napoleon liked seafood.
His favourite dish was oysters Florentine.

1076
01:34:28,932 --> 01:34:32,266
It's amazing, isn't it?
Churchill liked seafood.

1077
01:34:32,352 --> 01:34:36,267
All the great generals were keen on seafood.

1078
01:34:36,356 --> 01:34:39,393
What did Julius Caesar like, or Hitler?

1079
01:34:39,484 --> 01:34:42,853
Hitler liked clams.
And Mussolini liked squid.

1080
01:34:42,946 --> 01:34:45,781
- You're making it up.
- What do you know, Harris?

1081
01:34:45,866 --> 01:34:49,282
- What did the bookseller eat?
- You could tell from his vomit.

1082
01:34:49,369 --> 01:34:53,616
What do I care what he ate?
It all comes out as shit in the end.

1083
01:35:11,141 --> 01:35:13,181
(Sighs)

1084
01:35:13,936 --> 01:35:16,012
I'm so tired.

1085
01:35:19,024 --> 01:35:21,230
I'm going to sleep.

1086
01:35:36,124 --> 01:35:39,125
I've got a lot to tell you in the morning.

1087
01:35:40,295 --> 01:35:42,537
And I want you to listen.

1088
01:35:44,549 --> 01:35:48,132
Somebody should know.
And who can I tell but you?

1089
01:35:52,474 --> 01:35:54,930
And then...

1090
01:35:59,273 --> 01:36:01,598
when I wake up in the morning,

1091
01:36:05,904 --> 01:36:08,146
I want you to kiss me.

1092
01:36:12,578 --> 01:36:14,903
And then I want breakfast.

1093
01:36:16,039 --> 01:36:19,788
Erm, coffee and fresh rolls and butter

1094
01:36:22,337 --> 01:36:24,496
and marmalade.

1095
01:36:25,507 --> 01:36:28,710
And toast.

1096
01:36:29,886 --> 01:36:32,045
And...

1097
01:36:34,099 --> 01:36:36,257
Good night, Michael.

1098
01:36:41,607 --> 01:36:44,014
I'll see you in the morning.

1099
01:36:48,405 --> 01:36:50,528
I love you.

1100
01:36:52,242 --> 01:36:54,769
You shouldn't have done it.
It wasn't worth it.

1101
01:36:54,780 --> 01:36:55,621
You what?

1102
01:36:55,704 --> 01:37:00,081
Georgina wasn't worth it?
How bloody dare you say that?

1103
01:37:00,167 --> 01:37:04,912
Georgina's worth a thousand
snooty little Jewish book-keeping clerks

1104
01:37:05,005 --> 01:37:08,041
who masturbate over the French Revolution.

1105
01:37:08,133 --> 01:37:13,376
The book-keeper will get us into trouble
and he wasn't worth it. Calm down.

1106
01:37:13,472 --> 01:37:18,893
Little circumcised mediocrity
was screwing my wife! I will not calm down!

1107
01:37:18,977 --> 01:37:23,271
I've seen you, Harris, eyeing Georgina,
looking at another man's wife.

1108
01:37:23,357 --> 01:37:27,189
I've seen you watch her skirt fly up
when she got out of the car.

1109
01:37:27,277 --> 01:37:29,815
Yes, I've seen you sniffing her, Harris.

1110
01:37:29,905 --> 01:37:33,404
And to think I ever trusted you with her,

1111
01:37:34,201 --> 01:37:37,534
that I ever trusted you to drive her home
when I was drunk.

1112
01:37:37,621 --> 01:37:40,575
- You get out of this restaurant!
- Calm down.

1113
01:37:40,666 --> 01:37:44,284
Mitchel, get Richard.
I want this man banned. Get out!

1114
01:37:44,378 --> 01:37:47,960
- If you want to shout...
- I can shout in my own restaurant!

1115
01:37:48,048 --> 01:37:51,962
I own this restaurant. Get out! Fuck you!

1116
01:37:53,971 --> 01:37:57,920
Go, you mule! Richard, I'm closing you up.

1117
01:37:58,016 --> 01:38:01,884
- Really?
- You are finished, Richard.

1118
01:38:01,979 --> 01:38:07,400
Allowing decent people to dine
with wife snatchers. You're finished!

1119
01:38:07,484 --> 01:38:09,642
I think not, Mr. Spica!

1120
01:38:09,736 --> 01:38:15,241
And if I did, where would you eat?
Who would have you?

1121
01:38:15,325 --> 01:38:20,533
Now, if you'd kindly leave, we can start
clearing up the mess you have made.

1122
01:38:20,622 --> 01:38:25,699
I'm warning you. Tomorrow your restaurant
will be just one big car park.

1123
01:38:25,794 --> 01:38:28,332
- Nothing more.
- I wonder how you will do that.

1124
01:38:28,422 --> 01:38:29,992
A bulldozer, Richard.

1125
01:38:30,003 --> 01:38:33,592
Your cuisine will be
20 feet under brick dust.

1126
01:38:33,677 --> 01:38:37,093
Get out of it, Harris.
You get out of it.

1127
01:38:37,180 --> 01:38:41,178
Go on. I can tell loyalty when I see it.

1128
01:39:06,126 --> 01:39:08,368
Well, Michael,

1129
01:39:10,589 --> 01:39:12,795
you didn't kiss me

1130
01:39:15,010 --> 01:39:17,049
so...

1131
01:39:19,681 --> 01:39:22,599
I suppose I have to make my own breakfast.

1132
01:39:25,812 --> 01:39:27,971
Don't get up yet.

1133
01:39:44,373 --> 01:39:46,496
Well, Michael,

1134
01:39:49,544 --> 01:39:51,621
that's that.

1135
01:39:53,006 --> 01:39:56,506
Short and very sweet.

1136
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:04,057
Now you're not listening,
I suppose I could tell you about Albert.

1137
01:40:05,185 --> 01:40:10,180
I meant to tell you eventually
but I'd have to know you better because...

1138
01:40:10,274 --> 01:40:12,895
Well, because I'd be so ashamed.

1139
01:40:15,696 --> 01:40:20,239
But it's important that I tell you now
so that I can have done with it.

1140
01:40:26,540 --> 01:40:32,127
Albert beat me. Well, I know you know that.
You saw the bruises.

1141
01:40:33,422 --> 01:40:35,710
He was regular in his habits.

1142
01:40:41,221 --> 01:40:44,886
When we got back from the restaurant,
he'd make me get a hot, wet towel

1143
01:40:44,975 --> 01:40:47,264
and accompany him to the toilet.

1144
01:40:49,438 --> 01:40:51,680
And I'd have to wipe his...

1145
01:40:55,902 --> 01:40:59,069
After I finished, he... he made... Oh...

1146
01:41:03,577 --> 01:41:05,735
Help me, Michael.

1147
01:41:09,416 --> 01:41:14,374
On his side of the bed he had
a suitcase with all kinds of objects in it.

1148
01:41:14,463 --> 01:41:16,669
Er, a toothbrush,

1149
01:41:18,550 --> 01:41:20,709
a wooden spoon,

1150
01:41:24,222 --> 01:41:26,464
a plastic train,

1151
01:41:27,809 --> 01:41:29,849
a wine bottle.

1152
01:41:29,937 --> 01:41:32,143
And he'd use them.

1153
01:41:33,899 --> 01:41:38,608
If I didn't do it whilst he watched,
he'd insist on doing it himself.

1154
01:41:40,322 --> 01:41:43,406
At least when I did it,
it hurt less.

1155
01:41:45,911 --> 01:41:48,974
I don't think he was
very interested in sex -

1156
01:41:48,985 --> 01:41:50,915
not with me, not with women.

1157
01:41:55,170 --> 01:41:57,376
I left him four times.

1158
01:41:59,299 --> 01:42:01,541
I caught the night ferry.

1159
01:42:04,012 --> 01:42:08,092
He and Harris found me in Brussels,
they brought me back.

1160
01:42:09,476 --> 01:42:12,679
On the boat, Albert cried,
bought me presents.

1161
01:42:14,856 --> 01:42:19,602
But then after we landed,
when we got just outside the harbour,

1162
01:42:19,695 --> 01:42:22,482
before the motorway, he stopped the car

1163
01:42:22,572 --> 01:42:25,664
and he and Harris and
Spangler dragged me out

1164
01:42:25,675 --> 01:42:27,624
and stripped me and beat me.

1165
01:42:33,917 --> 01:42:35,957
<i>Michael,</i>

1166
01:42:38,297 --> 01:42:40,503
<i>all this must finish.</i>

1167
01:42:42,593 --> 01:42:45,677
<i>Help me, Michael. Please.</i>

1168
01:42:53,145 --> 01:42:55,268
He's dead.

1169
01:42:57,816 --> 01:43:03,023
They stuffed his mouth with paper
ripped from his favourite book.

1170
01:43:03,113 --> 01:43:06,114
- Could you cook him?
- Cook who, Georgina?

1171
01:43:07,618 --> 01:43:09,657
Michael.

1172
01:43:09,745 --> 01:43:12,532
No. Mon dieu, non.

1173
01:43:15,334 --> 01:43:20,375
You have a reputation
for a wide range of experimental dishes.

1174
01:43:22,799 --> 01:43:25,255
He might taste good.

1175
01:43:25,344 --> 01:43:27,585
I'm sure he would taste good.

1176
01:43:27,679 --> 01:43:30,135
What would taste best?

1177
01:43:30,223 --> 01:43:33,474
His heart? His liver?

1178
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:36,312
The cheeks of his backside?

1179
01:43:36,396 --> 01:43:39,848
(Laughs) His prairie oysters?

1180
01:43:42,444 --> 01:43:44,602
Georgina,

1181
01:43:44,696 --> 01:43:46,772
sit down.

1182
01:43:48,075 --> 01:43:50,151
Sit down.

1183
01:43:52,913 --> 01:43:56,412
When you make out a menu,
how do you price each dish?

1184
01:43:59,253 --> 01:44:02,419
I charge a lot for anything black.

1185
01:44:02,506 --> 01:44:06,669
Grapes, olives, blackcurrants.

1186
01:44:09,805 --> 01:44:12,759
People like to remind themselves of death,

1187
01:44:13,642 --> 01:44:17,592
eating black food is like consuming death,

1188
01:44:18,730 --> 01:44:25,528
like saying, "Death, I'm eating you."

1189
01:44:25,612 --> 01:44:29,859
Black truffles are the most expensive.
And caviar.

1190
01:44:31,785 --> 01:44:34,241
Death and birth.

1191
01:44:35,539 --> 01:44:38,374
The end and the beginning.

1192
01:44:39,668 --> 01:44:44,875
Don't you think it's appropriate
that the most expensive items are black?

1193
01:44:48,719 --> 01:44:51,044
We also charge for vanity.

1194
01:44:52,139 --> 01:44:55,140
Diet foods have an additional surcharge

1195
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:58,967
of 30%,

1196
01:44:59,855 --> 01:45:02,772
Aphrodisiacs, 50%.

1197
01:45:02,858 --> 01:45:08,018
And from what I saw,
your lover did not need an aphrodisiac.

1198
01:45:08,947 --> 01:45:12,815
What did you see? I want to know.

1199
01:45:13,994 --> 01:45:16,033
Nobody knew but you.

1200
01:45:16,997 --> 01:45:20,496
Everyone pitied me. Even you pitied me.

1201
01:45:20,584 --> 01:45:24,498
And how can I know that he loved me
if there were no witnesses?

1202
01:45:25,839 --> 01:45:31,046
If you loved him, that does not seem
to be a very necessary question.

1203
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:34,256
Yes, it does! Tell me what you know!

1204
01:45:37,517 --> 01:45:40,518
What I saw was what you let me see.

1205
01:45:43,106 --> 01:45:45,146
Of course it was.

1206
01:45:46,068 --> 01:45:50,694
How could I know that it was real
unless someone else was watching?

1207
01:45:53,075 --> 01:45:55,281
Tell me what you saw.

1208
01:45:56,286 --> 01:45:58,611
Or are you ashamed to tell me?

1209
01:46:02,417 --> 01:46:04,659
No.

1210
01:46:04,753 --> 01:46:07,125
I saw him kissing you

1211
01:46:09,258 --> 01:46:11,380
on the mouth,

1212
01:46:13,553 --> 01:46:15,676
on the neck,

1213
01:46:16,515 --> 01:46:18,673
behind your ear.

1214
01:46:22,437 --> 01:46:24,845
I saw him undressing you.

1215
01:46:29,486 --> 01:46:31,775
I saw him kissing your breasts.

1216
01:46:35,701 --> 01:46:39,568
I saw him put his hand between your legs.

1217
01:46:41,999 --> 01:46:44,371
And what did you see me do?

1218
01:46:48,088 --> 01:46:50,246
I saw you kiss him on the mouth.

1219
01:46:54,511 --> 01:46:58,972
I saw you lying under him
on the floor of the pantry.

1220
01:47:02,477 --> 01:47:05,728
I saw him take you from behind.

1221
01:47:10,402 --> 01:47:14,234
I saw you take his penis in your mouth.

1222
01:47:17,492 --> 01:47:19,865
I saw you...

1223
01:47:36,970 --> 01:47:39,592
Do lovers always behave like that?

1224
01:47:44,561 --> 01:47:47,681
My parents behaved like that.

1225
01:47:47,773 --> 01:47:49,812
They did?

1226
01:47:49,900 --> 01:47:54,361
- You saw them?
- And lovers in the cinema behave like that.

1227
01:47:54,446 --> 01:47:56,569
No, that doesn't count.

1228
01:47:56,657 --> 01:48:01,615
And in my fantasies,
lovers always behave like that.

1229
01:48:01,703 --> 01:48:04,490
Were you jealous?

1230
01:48:04,581 --> 01:48:06,788
Did we make you jealous?

1231
01:48:08,085 --> 01:48:10,291
Did you want to join us?

1232
01:48:11,421 --> 01:48:15,004
- If you did, help me now.
- Georgina, no.

1233
01:48:15,092 --> 01:48:20,466
In memory of us making love in your kitchen
and in your fantasies, help me now.

1234
01:48:20,555 --> 01:48:23,225
No.

1235
01:48:23,308 --> 01:48:27,436
In memory of your parents making love,
help me now.

1236
01:48:27,521 --> 01:48:29,560
Georgina, no!

1237
01:48:30,524 --> 01:48:33,145
People I like learn my name too late.

1238
01:48:34,653 --> 01:48:36,895
Too late?

1239
01:48:38,115 --> 01:48:40,321
Cook Michael for me.

1240
01:48:40,409 --> 01:48:42,448
No.

1241
01:48:43,537 --> 01:48:46,206
This was his favourite restaurant.

1242
01:48:47,207 --> 01:48:49,330
It's also mine.

1243
01:48:50,335 --> 01:48:52,494
Cook Michael for me.

1244
01:48:54,006 --> 01:48:56,876
If I did,

1245
01:48:56,967 --> 01:48:59,968
who would ever eat here again?

1246
01:49:04,141 --> 01:49:06,513
How can I make you change your mind?

1247
01:49:10,063 --> 01:49:13,764
Do you want to make love with me?
You can do what he did.

1248
01:49:17,529 --> 01:49:19,818
How can I persuade you?

1249
01:49:20,616 --> 01:49:22,988
You can't. You may have loved him...

1250
01:49:23,076 --> 01:49:25,650
You know I did, you saw me.

1251
01:49:27,247 --> 01:49:30,284
But you don't have to eat him, Georgina.

1252
01:49:30,375 --> 01:49:35,121
Do you... do you have some idea
that by eating him

1253
01:49:35,213 --> 01:49:37,669
he can become part of you?

1254
01:49:37,758 --> 01:49:42,254
You can't believe that by eating him
you can always be together!

1255
01:49:43,221 --> 01:49:45,428
I'm not eating him.

1256
01:49:48,518 --> 01:49:51,519
- Albert is.
- Albert?

1257
01:49:56,318 --> 01:49:58,856
There's £11,000. It's Michael's.

1258
01:50:06,411 --> 01:50:08,653
Put your money away.

1259
01:50:15,462 --> 01:50:17,620
Where is he?

1260
01:50:29,351 --> 01:50:31,474
(Georgina moaning)

1261
01:50:54,001 --> 01:50:56,124
(Georgina crying)

1262
01:51:08,765 --> 01:51:10,805
(Hollow banging)

1263
01:51:59,399 --> 01:52:01,475
(Banging on glass)

1264
01:52:03,362 --> 01:52:05,520
What's going on here?

1265
01:52:05,614 --> 01:52:09,825
Why do I suddenly have to come in
to my own restaurant like a stranger?

1266
01:52:09,910 --> 01:52:12,068
Special invitations.

1267
01:52:13,121 --> 01:52:16,537
Which I might say
could've gone to a better printer.

1268
01:52:16,625 --> 01:52:19,330
I have to bang on the door like an outcast.

1269
01:52:21,129 --> 01:52:23,169
Well, well, well.

1270
01:52:23,257 --> 01:52:28,381
Georgina Duckles.
What brings you here, you bitch?

1271
01:52:29,263 --> 01:52:32,845
I'm very surprised
you show your face here, you slut.

1272
01:52:32,933 --> 01:52:36,800
Where you been? Albert has been frantic.

1273
01:52:36,895 --> 01:52:39,517
Shut up, Grace. Find me a drink.

1274
01:52:39,606 --> 01:52:43,853
- Happy anniversary, Albert.
- I'll bloody kill you for what you did!

1275
01:52:43,944 --> 01:52:47,562
- You should find that easy.
- Don't think I'm taking you back.

1276
01:52:47,656 --> 01:52:49,814
I'll make you pay, you slut.

1277
01:52:49,908 --> 01:52:53,526
Your bottom's going to be
very, very sore for weeks.

1278
01:52:54,621 --> 01:52:58,951
No more books for you, girl.
You're staying in under lock and key.

1279
01:52:59,042 --> 01:53:03,751
There's going to be no more books
or prick-sniffing for you, girl.

1280
01:53:05,215 --> 01:53:07,623
Happy anniversary, Albert.

1281
01:53:07,718 --> 01:53:11,550
What are you talking about?
It's not my birthday.

1282
01:53:11,638 --> 01:53:15,837
No, but it's an anniversary
that I shall always celebrate,

1283
01:53:15,848 --> 01:53:18,267
even if you won't.
And you won't.

1284
01:53:18,353 --> 01:53:23,099
- What? Where is everybody?
- They'll be here presently.

1285
01:53:23,191 --> 01:53:25,896
- Look, Georgina.
- What?

1286
01:53:25,986 --> 01:53:29,604
- It's all over now.
- What is?

1287
01:53:29,698 --> 01:53:33,067
- Grace, just go and look out of a window.
- Oh.

1288
01:53:33,160 --> 01:53:35,567
Mitchel, bugger off out of it.

1289
01:53:35,662 --> 01:53:38,747
Look, Georgina, when the others arrive...

1290
01:53:38,832 --> 01:53:41,916
Where are they?
The invitation says nine o'clock.

1291
01:53:42,002 --> 01:53:45,620
- Where are they gonna sit?
- They'll be here presently.

1292
01:53:45,714 --> 01:53:49,759
Look, Georgina, you didn't...
didn't really like him, did you?

1293
01:53:49,843 --> 01:53:55,050
I mean, how could you like
a bloody book-keeper, a nobody?

1294
01:53:56,099 --> 01:54:00,845
I tell you what. I'll try...
We'll forget it, eh?

1295
01:54:01,688 --> 01:54:04,358
Eh? Come home with me.

1296
01:54:04,441 --> 01:54:08,818
Tell you the truth, Georgie,
I've been a bit miserable.

1297
01:54:08,904 --> 01:54:13,032
- Since it is your anniversary...
- What bloody anniversary?

1298
01:54:13,116 --> 01:54:15,156
I've brought you a present.

1299
01:54:15,244 --> 01:54:18,944
I don't need presents.
It's me who gives you presents.

1300
01:54:19,039 --> 01:54:22,788
Besides, you've never had
the money to give me presents.

1301
01:54:22,876 --> 01:54:25,284
And Richard has cooked it for you.

1302
01:54:26,296 --> 01:54:29,048
- Under my instructions.
- Oh?

1303
01:54:29,132 --> 01:54:31,208
Knowing how you like to eat.

1304
01:54:32,261 --> 01:54:35,012
Knowing how you like to gorge yourself.

1305
01:54:36,181 --> 01:54:39,431
And we've brought a few
of your friends around.

1306
01:55:45,834 --> 01:55:48,621
(Albert)
What sort of party is this, Georgie?

1307
01:55:50,339 --> 01:55:53,873
- What's going on?
- Sit down, Albert.

1308
01:55:54,968 --> 01:55:57,175
Can't I sit down, Georgina?

1309
01:55:57,262 --> 01:55:59,718
No, this is Albert's special treat.

1310
01:56:01,850 --> 01:56:07,686
- Here, I'm not eating with that Roy there.
- Shut up, Albert.

1311
01:56:09,691 --> 01:56:12,099
You're here to enjoy yourself.

1312
01:56:23,121 --> 01:56:25,161
Georgie.

1313
01:56:41,598 --> 01:56:43,840
Jesus!

1314
01:56:43,934 --> 01:56:45,428
God.

1315
01:56:49,523 --> 01:56:53,141
(Georgina)
No, it's not God, Albert. It's Michael.

1316
01:56:54,861 --> 01:56:56,901
My lover.

1317
01:56:57,906 --> 01:57:00,991
You vowed you would kill him, and you did.

1318
01:57:02,995 --> 01:57:05,367
And you vowed you would eat him.

1319
01:57:07,082 --> 01:57:09,407
Now eat him.

1320
01:57:11,295 --> 01:57:13,453
What's the matter?

1321
01:57:13,547 --> 01:57:17,295
You have your knife and fork.
You do know how to use them.

1322
01:57:17,426 --> 01:57:21,803
Or have all those carefully-learnt
table manners gone to waste?

1323
01:57:32,899 --> 01:57:35,569
Mitchel can pour you a drink.

1324
01:57:38,697 --> 01:57:40,820
(Mitchel whimpers)

1325
01:57:42,993 --> 01:57:45,698
Your waiter has opted out.

1326
01:57:45,787 --> 01:57:48,741
Er, Grace will pour for you.

1327
01:57:48,832 --> 01:57:50,872
Oh.

1328
01:57:54,046 --> 01:57:56,334
- Non, monsieur!
- Yah!

1329
01:58:14,816 --> 01:58:17,354
Eat, Albert.

1330
01:58:18,695 --> 01:58:21,103
Roy, pour Albert a drink.

1331
01:58:57,985 --> 01:59:02,647
Try the cock, Albert. It's a delicacy.

1332
01:59:03,574 --> 01:59:05,981
And you know where it's been.

1333
01:59:09,538 --> 01:59:11,577
(Grunting)

1334
01:59:42,321 --> 01:59:44,527
(Georgina) Go on, Albert.

1335
01:59:45,490 --> 01:59:47,530
Eat.

1336
02:00:05,344 --> 02:00:07,467
Bon appétit.

1337
02:00:09,890 --> 02:00:12,013
It's French.

1338
02:00:39,169 --> 02:00:41,209
Cannibal.

1339
02:03:50,152 --> 02:03:51,694
English SDH
