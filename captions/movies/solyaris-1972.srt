19
00:07:25,615 --> 00:07:27,674
<i>Kris, come here!</i>

20
00:07:28,718 --> 00:07:30,845
<i>You're just in time.</i>

21
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,946
He takes a walk every morning
for at least an hour.

22
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,888
I forbade him to come back earlier.

23
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,087
He's had a lot of work,
sometimes staying up all night.

24
00:07:40,162 --> 00:07:42,722
These Solarists!

25
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,036
He reminds me of a bookkeeper,
preparing his accounts.

26
00:07:49,238 --> 00:07:51,433
We expected you yesterday.

27
00:07:51,507 --> 00:07:54,067
He wanted to run away
when he saw me.

28
00:07:57,613 --> 00:07:59,376
Hello.

29
00:08:03,286 --> 00:08:05,186
Hello.

30
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:13,285
I probably shouldn't have
bothered you today.

31
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,436
How old you and I have become.
I've only just realized that.

32
00:08:22,338 --> 00:08:24,602
What are you apologizing for?

33
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,774
Does he understand
that everything depends

34
00:08:26,842 --> 00:08:28,810
on his first report
from the station?

35
00:08:28,878 --> 00:08:32,712
Everything we've received so far
has been confusing or incomprehensible.

36
00:08:33,015 --> 00:08:35,779
If he confirms that the work
can't continue for some reason,

37
00:08:35,851 --> 00:08:39,412
the station can be taken
out of Solaris' orbit.

38
00:08:41,023 --> 00:08:43,287
He understands.

39
00:08:43,693 --> 00:08:46,093
You promised to talk to him.
I brought the film.

40
00:08:46,162 --> 00:08:49,222
That's what I came here for.
- Yes, of course.

41
00:08:50,766 --> 00:08:54,463
Can the boy stay with you
for a few days?

42
00:08:54,737 --> 00:08:57,501
I have a lot to do
and no one to leave him with.

43
00:08:57,773 --> 00:09:02,107
Anna will look after him.
She'll have more free time now.

44
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,680
When does he leave?

45
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:17,256
He'll be gone by tomorrow morning.

46
00:09:28,671 --> 00:09:30,935
It's so pleasant here.

47
00:09:31,874 --> 00:09:35,776
This house reminds me
of my grandfather's house.

48
00:09:35,845 --> 00:09:37,608
I really liked it.

49
00:09:37,847 --> 00:09:41,180
So we decided
to build one just like it.

50
00:09:42,084 --> 00:09:44,416
I don't like innovation.

51
00:11:08,604 --> 00:11:10,868
I'd better get going.

52
00:11:13,342 --> 00:11:15,469
I have a lot to do.

53
00:11:18,581 --> 00:11:21,345
Don't you want to see this?

54
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:23,885
I've already seen it many times.

55
00:11:28,057 --> 00:11:30,321
<i>On the 21st day of our expedition,</i>

56
00:11:30,392 --> 00:11:32,656
<i>radio-biologist Vishyakov
and physicist Fekhner</i>

57
00:11:32,728 --> 00:11:38,724
<i>went on an exploratory flight
over the Solaris Ocean in a hydroplane.</i>

58
00:11:39,502 --> 00:11:43,461
<i>When they failed to return after
16 hours, we declared an emergency.</i>

59
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:47,236
<i>The fog was thick and we were forced
to call the search off.</i>

60
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,774
<i>All of the rescue craft
returned to the station</i>

61
00:11:50,846 --> 00:11:55,306
<i>except for the helicopter
operated by Burton.</i>

62
00:11:55,985 --> 00:11:59,318
<i>Burton returned an hour after dark.</i>

63
00:11:59,555 --> 00:12:02,615
<i>Once out of the helicopter,
he ran to his quarters.</i>

64
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:06,150
<i>He was in a state of shock.</i>

65
00:12:06,662 --> 00:12:09,062
<i>This was highly unusual</i>

66
00:12:09,131 --> 00:12:14,660
<i>for a man with 11 years
of experience flying in space.</i>

67
00:12:14,737 --> 00:12:16,466
<i>He recovered in a couple of days,</i>

68
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:19,440
<i>but he would never leave the station</i>

69
00:12:19,508 --> 00:12:23,467
<i>and refused to approach the window
overlooking the Ocean.</i>

70
00:12:23,712 --> 00:12:26,078
<i>Later he wrote to us from the clinic.</i>

71
00:12:26,148 --> 00:12:30,585
<i>He was preparing a statement
of great importance,</i>

72
00:12:30,653 --> 00:12:33,816
<i>one that would decide
the fate of Solaristics.</i>

73
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:37,689
<i>Excellent.
Let's hear what he has to say.</i>

74
00:12:40,763 --> 00:12:44,631
<i>At this time,
let us give the floor to Burton.</i>

75
00:12:45,134 --> 00:12:47,034
<i>Thank you.</i>

76
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:58,141
<i>When I first descended
below 300 meters,</i>

77
00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:01,115
<i>I had trouble maintaining altitude.</i>

78
00:13:01,183 --> 00:13:03,151
<i>There was a strong wind.</i>

79
00:13:05,955 --> 00:13:09,584
<i>All of my attention went towards
operating the ship.</i>

80
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:14,225
<i>I did not look out of the cabin.</i>

81
00:13:15,364 --> 00:13:20,028
<i>As a result, I wound up in a fog.
- Was it an ordinary fog?</i>

82
00:13:20,102 --> 00:13:23,560
<i>Of course not.</i>

83
00:13:23,672 --> 00:13:27,335
<i>It seemed to be colloidal and viscous.</i>

84
00:13:28,344 --> 00:13:30,778
<i>It coated all of the windows.</i>

85
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,209
<i>Because of the fog's resistance,
I began to lose altitude.</i>

86
00:13:38,654 --> 00:13:40,645
<i>I couldn't see the sun,</i>

87
00:13:40,723 --> 00:13:44,181
<i>but the fog glowed red
in its direction.</i>

88
00:13:46,128 --> 00:13:49,996
<i>After half an hour
I came out into a large, open space.</i>

89
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:54,994
<i>It was almost round,
a few hundred meters across.</i>

90
00:13:57,406 --> 00:14:02,537
<i>At that point,
I noticed a change in the Ocean.</i>

91
00:14:03,178 --> 00:14:05,544
<i>The waves disappeared.</i>

92
00:14:05,681 --> 00:14:09,117
<i>The surface became almost transparent,
with clouded patches.</i>

93
00:14:09,718 --> 00:14:12,710
<i>Yellow sludge gathered beneath it.</i>

94
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:19,750
<i>It rose up in thin strips
and sparkled like glass.</i>

95
00:14:20,296 --> 00:14:25,063
<i>Then it began to seethe,
boil and harden.</i>

96
00:14:25,267 --> 00:14:28,532
<i>It looked like molasses.</i>

97
00:14:29,638 --> 00:14:34,837
<i>This sludge or slime
gathered into large lumps</i>

98
00:14:35,477 --> 00:14:39,277
<i>and slowly formed
different shapes.</i>

99
00:14:40,082 --> 00:14:43,142
<i>I was being drawn into the fog,</i>

100
00:14:43,352 --> 00:14:45,843
<i>so I had to struggle
against this for some time.</i>

101
00:14:47,356 --> 00:14:52,555
<i>When I looked down again,
I saw a sort of garden.</i>

102
00:14:52,928 --> 00:14:54,418
A garden?

103
00:14:55,831 --> 00:14:58,459
<i>Attention, please.</i>

104
00:14:58,534 --> 00:15:03,335
<i>I saw shrubs, hedges,
acacia trees, little paths.</i>

105
00:15:03,405 --> 00:15:05,635
<i>Everything was made
of the same substance.</i>

106
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:09,838
<i>Did these trees and plants
have leaves?</i>

107
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:13,580
<i>These shrubs and acacias?</i>

108
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:17,779
<i>No, I already said they were all made
of plaster, but life-sized.</i>

109
00:15:18,854 --> 00:15:22,187
<i>Then everything began
to crack and break.</i>

110
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:27,622
<i>Yellow sludge poured out of the fissures.</i>

111
00:15:27,696 --> 00:15:30,893
<i>Everything began to boil even harder,
and foam appeared.</i>

112
00:15:33,369 --> 00:15:35,337
<i>You can see for yourselves.</i>

113
00:15:35,404 --> 00:15:37,531
<i>I used a camera from time to time.</i>

114
00:15:37,606 --> 00:15:42,009
<i>Everything I saw before and after
should be on film.</i>

115
00:15:42,244 --> 00:15:45,907
<i>Then I propose we interrupt
these discussions</i>

116
00:15:46,181 --> 00:15:50,481
<i>and see everything with our own eyes.</i>

117
00:15:51,887 --> 00:15:56,722
<i>All right, show us your film.
This is very interesting.</i>

118
00:17:35,023 --> 00:17:36,854
<i>Is that it?</i>

119
00:17:37,392 --> 00:17:39,189
<i>That's all of your film?</i>

120
00:17:39,728 --> 00:17:41,525
<i>Yes, that's everything.</i>

121
00:17:41,964 --> 00:17:45,957
<i>But we don't understand.
You filmed clouds.</i>

122
00:17:47,202 --> 00:17:49,568
<i>Why did you film clouds?</i>

123
00:17:49,638 --> 00:17:53,130
<i>That must be the fog
I told you about.</i>

124
00:17:56,478 --> 00:17:58,673
<i>I wasn't expecting this.</i>

125
00:18:01,183 --> 00:18:04,846
<i>All of this could be the result
of Solaris' bio-magnetic current</i>

126
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,081
<i>acting on Burton's consciousness.</i>

127
00:18:07,256 --> 00:18:11,124
<i>We now know the current is not only
a gigantic cerebral system,</i>

128
00:18:11,193 --> 00:18:13,627
<i>but a substance capable
of thought processes.</i>

129
00:18:13,695 --> 00:18:16,323
<i>That hypothesis is questionable.</i>

130
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:20,625
<i>Were you feeling sick that day?</i>

131
00:18:21,236 --> 00:18:24,330
The next part is meaningless.

132
00:18:29,244 --> 00:18:31,109
Let's pick up here.

133
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:34,580
<i>I discovered something floating
in one of the openings.</i>

134
00:18:36,151 --> 00:18:39,245
<i>It looked like Fechner's space suit.</i>

135
00:18:39,521 --> 00:18:43,150
<i>Its shape was that of a person.</i>

136
00:18:44,226 --> 00:18:47,923
<i>I turned around-
I didn't want to lose sight of that spot.</i>

137
00:18:48,964 --> 00:18:52,923
<i>At that moment,
the figure rose slightly,</i>

138
00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:58,365
<i>as if it were swimming
or treading the waves.</i>

139
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:05,612
<i>This person had no space suit,
and he was moving.</i>

140
00:19:05,681 --> 00:19:07,615
<i>I don't understand. "Person"?</i>

141
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,682
<i>Yes, person.</i>

142
00:19:13,155 --> 00:19:16,522
<i>Just a minute.
Did you see his face?</i>

143
00:19:16,592 --> 00:19:17,991
<i>Yes.</i>

144
00:19:23,832 --> 00:19:26,198
What person?

145
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:32,769
<i>Who was it?</i>

146
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:36,568
<i>It was a child.</i>

147
00:19:36,645 --> 00:19:39,614
<i>What child?
Had you seen him before?</i>

148
00:19:39,681 --> 00:19:43,617
<i>No, never.
In any case, not that I remember.</i>

149
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,220
<i>When I flew closer to him,</i>

150
00:19:48,857 --> 00:19:51,917
<i>I noticed something awful.</i>

151
00:19:51,994 --> 00:19:53,757
What do you mean?

152
00:19:58,133 --> 00:20:01,000
<i>I couldn't make it out at first.</i>

153
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:06,772
<i>Then I saw that he was
unusually large. Gigantic.</i>

154
00:20:07,376 --> 00:20:11,870
<i>He was about four meters tall.</i>

155
00:20:12,147 --> 00:20:16,675
<i>He had blue eyes</i>

156
00:20:17,185 --> 00:20:18,846
<i>and dark hair.</i>

157
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,514
<i>Perhaps you're not feeling well?</i>

158
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:27,659
<i>We'll postpone the meeting.</i>

159
00:20:28,964 --> 00:20:31,262
<i>I'll continue.</i>

160
00:20:37,673 --> 00:20:41,700
<i>He was naked, absolutely naked,</i>

161
00:20:42,344 --> 00:20:44,642
<i>like a newborn.</i>

162
00:20:46,314 --> 00:20:50,273
<i>He was wet, or rather, slippery.</i>

163
00:20:50,986 --> 00:20:52,920
<i>His skin was shiny.</i>

164
00:20:53,288 --> 00:20:57,622
<i>He rose and fell like the waves,
but he was moving by himself.</i>

165
00:20:57,693 --> 00:21:00,662
<i>It was disgusting.</i>

166
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,903
I'm sorry.
I'll jump ahead a little.

167
00:21:16,912 --> 00:21:19,472
There isn't much more.

168
00:21:19,915 --> 00:21:25,581
<i>Burton's statements appear to be
the result of a hallucinatory complex</i>

169
00:21:25,687 --> 00:21:28,520
<i>brought on
by the planet's atmosphere,</i>

170
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,717
<i>as well as symptoms of depression</i>

171
00:21:30,792 --> 00:21:34,250
<i>exacerbated by inflammation
of the associative zone</i>

172
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:36,923
<i>of the cerebral cortex.</i>

173
00:21:36,998 --> 00:21:40,195
<i>This report in no way,
or in almost no way,</i>

174
00:21:40,268 --> 00:21:42,668
<i>corresponds with reality.</i>

175
00:21:43,538 --> 00:21:46,006
<i>What do you mean "almost"?</i>

176
00:21:46,074 --> 00:21:48,941
<i>Excuse me, I'm not finished yet.</i>

177
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:52,810
<i>Professor Messenger
offers a different opinion.</i>

178
00:21:52,881 --> 00:21:57,978
<i>He believes that Burton's statements
could be founded in reality</i>

179
00:21:58,053 --> 00:22:02,353
<i>and merit further study.</i>

180
00:22:02,424 --> 00:22:03,948
<i>That's it.</i>

181
00:22:05,527 --> 00:22:07,927
<i>I saw it all with my own eyes.</i>

182
00:22:11,633 --> 00:22:14,966
<i>I would like to offer
another opinion.</i>

183
00:22:15,771 --> 00:22:19,207
<i>We stand on the brink
of an enormous discovery,</i>

184
00:22:19,441 --> 00:22:24,538
<i>Our decision should not rely
on the observations</i>

185
00:22:24,613 --> 00:22:29,380
<i>of a man without
any scientific qualifications.</i>

186
00:22:30,252 --> 00:22:34,416
<i>Although any researcher
may envy this pilot,</i>

187
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:39,190
<i>his presence of mind,
his gift of observation.</i>

188
00:22:39,928 --> 00:22:43,455
<i>Moreover, in light
of recent information,</i>

189
00:22:43,999 --> 00:22:49,665
<i>we are morally obligated
to continue the exploration.</i>

190
00:22:50,572 --> 00:22:53,336
<i>I can understand
how Professor Messenger feels.</i>

191
00:22:53,408 --> 00:22:55,103
<i>I understand him.</i>

192
00:22:55,177 --> 00:22:58,203
<i>But let's take a look
at the road we've traveled.</i>

193
00:22:58,346 --> 00:23:04,307
<i>Solaristics is exactly
where it began.</i>

194
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:08,312
<i>Years of work have been in vain.</i>

195
00:23:11,593 --> 00:23:16,496
<i>Everything we now know
about Solaris is negative</i>

196
00:23:17,065 --> 00:23:22,025
<i>and has come to resemble a mountain
of disjointed, incoherent facts</i>

197
00:23:22,103 --> 00:23:25,561
<i>that strain credulity.</i>

198
00:23:26,808 --> 00:23:30,175
We're in exactly
the same situation today.

199
00:23:31,913 --> 00:23:34,006
Solaristics is degenerating.

200
00:23:34,082 --> 00:23:36,812
<i>But what we're talking about
is far more serious</i>

201
00:23:36,885 --> 00:23:38,546
<i>than just the study of Solaristics.</i>

202
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:42,483
<i>We're talking about the boundaries
of human knowledge.</i>

203
00:23:42,624 --> 00:23:46,458
<i>Don't you think that
by establishing artificial barriers</i>

204
00:23:46,528 --> 00:23:50,965
<i>we deliver a blow
to the idea of limitless thought?</i>

205
00:23:51,566 --> 00:23:57,266
<i>By limiting our movement forward,
we facilitate moving backwards.</i>

206
00:23:57,505 --> 00:23:59,973
<i>I nevertheless repeat my question.</i>

207
00:24:00,175 --> 00:24:02,040
<i>What do you mean by saying</i>

208
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:05,045
<i>the report of my observations in almost
no way corresponds with reality?</i>

209
00:24:05,747 --> 00:24:10,650
<i>I saw everything with my own eyes.
What do you mean by "almost"?</i>

210
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:15,622
<i>"Almost no way" means
that some real phenomena</i>

211
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:18,989
<i>could have triggered
your hallucinations, Burton.</i>

212
00:24:20,729 --> 00:24:22,822
<i>When it's windy,</i>

213
00:24:22,898 --> 00:24:27,460
<i>it's easy to confuse a swaying bush
with a living being,</i>

214
00:24:27,936 --> 00:24:31,667
<i>to say nothing of a foreign planet.</i>

215
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,467
<i>I meant no offense, Burton.
None.</i>

216
00:24:35,644 --> 00:24:40,104
<i>I'd like to know what impact
Professor Messenger's opinion will have.</i>

217
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:43,111
<i>Practically none,</i>

218
00:24:43,385 --> 00:24:49,017
<i>which means that exploration
in this area will be discontinued.</i>

219
00:24:49,357 --> 00:24:51,188
<i>Just a moment. Yes...</i>

220
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:52,851
<i>I'd like to make a statement.</i>

221
00:24:52,928 --> 00:24:55,328
<i>The commission has not offended me,</i>

222
00:24:55,397 --> 00:24:57,388
<i>but it has offended
the spirit of the expedition.</i>

223
00:24:57,465 --> 00:25:00,059
<i>Therefore, I consider it
my duty to announce...</i>

224
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:05,095
And so on...

225
00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:09,877
Nowadays it's considered
good manners to laugh

226
00:25:09,945 --> 00:25:13,312
when Burton's report is mentioned.

227
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,141
Thank you, Burton.

228
00:25:17,218 --> 00:25:20,813
We've known you for a long time,
but I never knew anything about you.

229
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:26,659
You know, you were very handsome.

230
00:25:26,728 --> 00:25:30,220
That's not true,
but thanks anyway.

231
00:25:30,865 --> 00:25:32,662
Excuse me.

232
00:25:38,306 --> 00:25:41,275
Well, Kris, what do you think?

233
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,601
If you don't mind,

234
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:50,049
I'd like to speak to your son alone.

235
00:25:50,418 --> 00:25:54,548
I don't want to look like an idiot
in front of you yet again.

236
00:25:56,858 --> 00:25:59,850
I'll wait for you outside by the swing.

237
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:07,833
What a ridiculous man.

238
00:26:07,969 --> 00:26:11,200
You have no reason to say that.

239
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,608
He's ill at ease.

240
00:26:14,843 --> 00:26:17,971
He thinks he's getting
in the way of our farewell.

241
00:26:21,683 --> 00:26:23,674
He's a tactful man.

242
00:26:23,752 --> 00:26:27,449
If he decided to come, it's because
he considers this important.

243
00:26:29,124 --> 00:26:33,561
Although, I admit,
I'd rather not see anyone now.

244
00:26:33,762 --> 00:26:36,128
You and I rarely get
a chance to talk.

245
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:45,198
I'm glad to hear you say that.

246
00:26:46,908 --> 00:26:49,172
Even if it's on the last day.

247
00:27:01,489 --> 00:27:03,616
The last day.

248
00:27:06,728 --> 00:27:12,291
One always feels awful
after a big farewell.

249
00:27:13,935 --> 00:27:15,596
Here comes your aunt.

250
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:19,003
Let's meet after lunch.
We need to talk.

251
00:27:19,274 --> 00:27:24,109
Why did you have to invite this Burton
today of all days?

252
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:29,643
Where are the guests going to sleep?
Next to you, or in the room upstairs?

253
00:27:31,653 --> 00:27:33,985
Upstairs, I guess.

254
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:39,085
Well, I'm off to my meeting
by the swing.

255
00:27:39,294 --> 00:27:41,660
- Maybe...
- Just a moment.

256
00:27:44,032 --> 00:27:46,899
You and your rooms can wait!

257
00:27:56,044 --> 00:27:58,171
Listen, Kris...

258
00:28:16,197 --> 00:28:18,097
What happened?

259
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,469
- What's standing over there?
- What are you afraid of?

260
00:28:21,536 --> 00:28:23,504
In the garage, staring at me.

261
00:28:23,571 --> 00:28:25,163
It's a horse.

262
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,367
Don't. I've seen it already.

263
00:28:27,442 --> 00:28:29,501
Come on.

264
00:28:32,147 --> 00:28:35,639
He's gentle.
Look how beautiful he is.

265
00:28:42,457 --> 00:28:48,191
You understand, I think
Solaristics has reached an impasse

266
00:28:48,263 --> 00:28:51,232
as a result
of irresponsible daydreaming.

267
00:28:52,367 --> 00:28:54,267
I'm interested in the truth,

268
00:28:54,335 --> 00:28:57,429
but you want to turn me
into a biased supporter.

269
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,835
I don't have the right to make decisions
based on impulses of the heart.

270
00:29:02,911 --> 00:29:06,039
I'm not a poet.
I have a concrete goal:

271
00:29:06,114 --> 00:29:09,174
Either stop the research
and remove the station from orbit,

272
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:13,016
thereby legitimizing
the Solaristics crisis,

273
00:29:13,388 --> 00:29:16,016
or take extreme measures.

274
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:19,184
Perhaps bombard the Ocean
with heavy radiation.

275
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,319
- Not that!
- Why not?

276
00:29:21,396 --> 00:29:25,799
Didn't you say research
should continue at any price?

277
00:29:26,201 --> 00:29:31,798
You want to destroy that which we are
presently incapable of understanding?

278
00:29:32,974 --> 00:29:36,933
Forgive me, but I am not an advocate
of knowledge at any price.

279
00:29:37,712 --> 00:29:42,172
Knowledge is only valid
when it's based on morality.

280
00:29:43,751 --> 00:29:47,915
Man is the one who renders science
moral or immoral.

281
00:29:47,989 --> 00:29:49,684
Remember Hiroshima.

282
00:29:49,757 --> 00:29:52,157
Then don't make science immoral.

283
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,651
It's strange...

284
00:29:57,498 --> 00:30:00,524
Strange.
There's nothing strange about it.

285
00:30:02,503 --> 00:30:06,633
You yourself can't be sure
that what you saw

286
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:09,370
wasn't just hallucinations.

287
00:30:09,444 --> 00:30:11,309
Thank you very much.

288
00:30:11,379 --> 00:30:13,745
It's seems there's
nothing more to discuss.

289
00:30:18,453 --> 00:30:20,353
- What happened?
- I'm leaving.

290
00:30:20,421 --> 00:30:22,184
Where are you going?

291
00:30:24,525 --> 00:30:26,686
He's an accountant, not a scientist.
You were right.

292
00:30:26,761 --> 00:30:29,958
You and I are friends, but that doesn't
mean you can say that about him.

293
00:30:30,031 --> 00:30:34,593
Great. You and I have known each other
for 20 years. It had to end someday.

294
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:37,603
Are you leaving the boy?

295
00:30:49,317 --> 00:30:52,809
What did you have to offend him for?
You're too harsh.

296
00:30:52,887 --> 00:30:57,187
It's dangerous to send
people like you into space.

297
00:30:57,258 --> 00:31:00,716
Everything there is too fragile.
Yes, fragile!

298
00:31:00,795 --> 00:31:04,788
The Earth has somehow
become adjusted to people like you,

299
00:31:04,966 --> 00:31:06,797
although at what sacrifice!

300
00:31:07,302 --> 00:31:11,466
What, are you jealous that he'll be
the one to bury me, and not you?

301
00:31:29,357 --> 00:31:34,351
<i>Thus, it had been established that
the Solaris Ocean is a distinctive brain.</i>

302
00:31:34,962 --> 00:31:38,420
<i>Right after that, an even more daring
hypothesis came out,</i>

303
00:31:38,499 --> 00:31:41,525
<i>suggesting that the Ocean
is a thinking substance.</i>

304
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:46,267
<i>Incidentally, this hypothesis</i>

305
00:31:46,341 --> 00:31:49,970
<i>still cannot be confirmed or refuted.</i>

306
00:31:50,878 --> 00:31:53,608
It's a program about Solaris.

307
00:31:54,782 --> 00:31:57,808
<i>There are few believers left.</i>

308
00:31:57,885 --> 00:32:01,685
<i>First of all, there are those connected
to the fate of the Solaris station.</i>

309
00:32:01,889 --> 00:32:05,347
<i>On this huge station
built to house 85 people</i>

310
00:32:05,426 --> 00:32:07,223
<i>there is now a crew of three.</i>

311
00:32:07,295 --> 00:32:09,957
<i>They are: astro-biologist Sartorius,</i>

312
00:32:10,031 --> 00:32:12,329
<i>cyberneticist Snaut,</i>

313
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:16,537
<i>and physiologist Gibarian,
who deal with the problem...</i>

314
00:32:18,239 --> 00:32:20,173
<i>I'm calling from the city.</i>

315
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:22,172
Burton.

316
00:32:23,778 --> 00:32:27,111
Anna, leave for a minute.
We need to talk.

317
00:32:33,688 --> 00:32:38,921
<i>I didn't talk to Kris
about what was most important:</i>

318
00:32:39,594 --> 00:32:44,463
<i>about Messenger, who voiced
a different opinion at that meeting.</i>

319
00:32:45,533 --> 00:32:50,027
<i>He became very interested in Fechner,
who died in the Solaris Ocean.</i>

320
00:32:51,706 --> 00:32:55,335
<i>It turns out that Fechner
has an orphaned son.</i>

321
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:58,868
<i>He had left his family.</i>

322
00:32:59,313 --> 00:33:04,546
<i>Messenger and I paid a visit
to Fechner's widow,</i>

323
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,689
<i>and I saw this boy with my own eyes.</i>

324
00:33:08,756 --> 00:33:10,951
You never told me about that.

325
00:33:11,025 --> 00:33:12,686
<i>I never got the chance.</i>

326
00:33:13,561 --> 00:33:16,860
Fine. Go on.

327
00:33:17,098 --> 00:33:22,092
<i>This child was identical
to the one I saw on Solaris.</i>

328
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,800
<i>Of course,
he wasn't four meters tall.</i>

329
00:33:26,874 --> 00:33:30,037
<i>He shouldn't think about this
too much before liftoff,</i>

330
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,010
<i>but he should keep it in mind.</i>

331
00:39:22,496 --> 00:39:24,555
There's no point
in keeping these papers.

332
00:39:24,632 --> 00:39:27,362
The ones to hold on to are in my room.

333
00:39:45,419 --> 00:39:49,753
My research notes, my thesis...
I held on to so much.

334
00:39:58,332 --> 00:40:02,860
If something should happen,
I'll find someone to take care of them.

335
00:40:03,637 --> 00:40:06,037
I'll come up with something.

336
00:40:06,207 --> 00:40:10,041
Don't look for that film.
I'm taking it with me.

337
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:12,476
Remember?
The one of the bonfire?

338
00:40:12,546 --> 00:40:14,844
Yes, of course.

339
00:43:23,871 --> 00:43:26,965
<i>- Ready, Kelvin?
- Ready, Moddard.</i>

340
00:43:27,174 --> 00:43:29,472
<i>Don't worry about a thing.</i>

341
00:43:29,543 --> 00:43:32,808
<i>Have a great trip.
Send our regards.</i>

342
00:43:33,013 --> 00:43:37,643
<i>- When is liftoff?
- You're already flying, Kris! Take care.</i>

343
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:13,879
<i>Solaris station! Do something!</i>

344
00:44:13,954 --> 00:44:17,856
<i>I'm losing stability.
This is Kelvin, over.</i>

345
00:46:11,605 --> 00:46:13,937
Hey, where is everyone?

346
00:46:14,007 --> 00:46:16,373
You've got guests.

347
00:47:47,034 --> 00:47:48,899
Dr. Snaut?

348
00:48:14,561 --> 00:48:15,994
Snaut?

349
00:48:25,372 --> 00:48:27,932
I'm Kelvin, the psychologist.

350
00:48:29,676 --> 00:48:33,305
It looks like you weren't
expecting me.

351
00:48:35,682 --> 00:48:38,583
Did you receive the radiogram?

352
00:48:42,356 --> 00:48:46,019
Yes, of course.

353
00:49:01,341 --> 00:49:03,332
What's with you?

354
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:10,081
Forgive me.

355
00:49:12,386 --> 00:49:15,549
Where's Gibarian?
Where's Sartorius?

356
00:49:15,956 --> 00:49:18,186
Sartorius is in his quarters.

357
00:49:18,258 --> 00:49:19,953
Gibarian is dead.

358
00:49:20,093 --> 00:49:21,890
What do you mean "dead"?

359
00:49:25,399 --> 00:49:27,924
Suicide.

360
00:49:31,338 --> 00:49:33,499
I beg your pardon.

361
00:49:33,907 --> 00:49:36,034
I knew Gibarian
and he would never have...

362
00:49:36,109 --> 00:49:40,876
He was almost always
in a state of deep depression

363
00:49:41,548 --> 00:49:45,882
ever since these disturbances began...

364
00:49:50,791 --> 00:49:54,887
Why don't you go rest, take a bath?

365
00:49:54,961 --> 00:49:59,557
Take any room
and come back in an hour.

366
00:50:00,033 --> 00:50:04,595
I would like to see Gibarian -
I mean, Sartorius.

367
00:50:04,938 --> 00:50:06,496
Later.

368
00:50:06,573 --> 00:50:10,031
I doubt he'd see you now.
He's upstairs, in the laboratory.

369
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:12,271
Listen, Snaut,

370
00:50:12,379 --> 00:50:17,248
I understand that something extraordinary
has happened and maybe...

371
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:26,117
Dr. Kelvin...

372
00:50:28,829 --> 00:50:34,392
You understand...
Come back in an hour. Please.

373
00:50:36,036 --> 00:50:38,903
Go and rest.

374
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:44,904
Listen, there are only three of us:
you, me and Sartorius.

375
00:50:44,978 --> 00:50:47,879
You know us from our photographs.

376
00:50:47,948 --> 00:50:50,917
If you see something
out of the ordinary,

377
00:50:50,984 --> 00:50:55,114
something besides me and Sartorius,
try not to lose your head.

378
00:50:55,188 --> 00:50:56,815
What would I see?

379
00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:00,189
I don't know.
That sort of depends on you.

380
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:01,921
Hallucinations?

381
00:51:01,995 --> 00:51:05,829
No. Just remember.

382
00:51:06,433 --> 00:51:09,766
- Remember what?
- That we're not on Earth.

383
00:51:10,737 --> 00:51:14,901
You know, it would be better if you
came back in the evening, or at night.

384
00:51:14,975 --> 00:51:18,206
No, let's make it tomorrow morning.

385
00:53:01,615 --> 00:53:05,016
A. GIBARIAN

386
00:53:11,157 --> 00:53:13,284
HUMAN BEING

387
00:53:46,226 --> 00:53:48,217
FOR K. KELVIN

388
00:54:06,146 --> 00:54:08,273
<i>Hi, Kris.</i>

389
00:54:15,789 --> 00:54:18,383
<i>I still have a little time left.</i>

390
00:54:18,558 --> 00:54:21,254
<i>There are some things
I must tell you,</i>

391
00:54:21,728 --> 00:54:24,322
<i>and some things
I must warn you about.</i>

392
00:54:24,397 --> 00:54:28,561
<i>By now you're at the station
and know what happened to me.</i>

393
00:54:29,035 --> 00:54:33,472
<i>If not, Snaut or Sartorius
will tell you.</i>

394
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:39,003
<i>What happened to me...</i>

395
00:54:41,915 --> 00:54:43,849
<i>is not important.</i>

396
00:54:43,917 --> 00:54:48,081
<i>Or rather, it cannot be explained.</i>

397
00:54:48,154 --> 00:54:52,090
<i>I'm afraid that what happened to me
is only the beginning.</i>

398
00:54:54,194 --> 00:54:56,890
<i>I wouldn't, of course,
want it to happen...</i>

399
00:54:56,963 --> 00:55:01,423
<i>but this could happen to you
and the others.</i>

400
00:55:02,736 --> 00:55:08,368
<i>Here, it could probably
happen to anyone.</i>

401
00:55:08,441 --> 00:55:11,069
<i>Just don't think
that I've lost my mind.</i>

402
00:55:11,144 --> 00:55:14,705
<i>I'm of sound mind, Kris.
Believe me.</i>

403
00:55:18,785 --> 00:55:21,413
<i>After all, you know me.</i>

404
00:55:23,723 --> 00:55:27,682
<i>If I have enough time,
I'll tell you why I did everything.</i>

405
00:55:28,061 --> 00:55:32,361
<i>I'm telling you this so that,
if it does happen to you,</i>

406
00:55:32,432 --> 00:55:36,368
<i>you'll know it's not madness.</i>

407
00:55:36,436 --> 00:55:38,495
<i>That's the most important thing.</i>

408
00:55:38,571 --> 00:55:43,099
<i>As for continuing research,</i>

409
00:55:43,176 --> 00:55:46,270
<i>I'm leaning towards
Sartorius' proposal,</i>

410
00:55:46,346 --> 00:55:51,511
<i>subjecting the Ocean's plasma
to heavy radiation.</i>

411
00:55:52,819 --> 00:55:56,949
<i>I know it's prohibited,
but there's no other choice.</i>

412
00:55:57,023 --> 00:55:58,684
<i>We...</i>

413
00:55:59,826 --> 00:56:02,795
<i>You will get mired in it.</i>

414
00:56:04,664 --> 00:56:10,193
<i>It may offer a way
of breaking this deadlock.</i>

415
00:56:11,604 --> 00:56:15,267
<i>This is our only chance
to make contact with this monster.</i>

416
00:56:15,341 --> 00:56:18,037
<i>There is no other choice, Kris.</i>

417
00:56:18,511 --> 00:56:20,706
<i>If...</i>

418
00:59:36,442 --> 00:59:39,809
Dr. Sartorius, I am Kelvin.

419
00:59:39,879 --> 00:59:42,609
I arrived two hours ago.

420
00:59:54,394 --> 00:59:58,455
Listen, this is ridiculous.

421
01:00:02,101 --> 01:00:05,070
Either open up
or I'll break down the door.

422
01:00:05,238 --> 01:00:08,833
All right, I'll open the door,
but don't come in.

423
01:00:08,908 --> 01:00:11,308
I'll come out.
- Fine.

424
01:00:14,614 --> 01:00:16,912
My name is Kelvin.

425
01:00:17,917 --> 01:00:19,316
Go on.

426
01:00:19,385 --> 01:00:21,717
You must have heard of me.

427
01:00:21,788 --> 01:00:24,985
I work, or worked, with Gibarian.

428
01:00:25,058 --> 01:00:26,252
Go on.

429
01:00:26,325 --> 01:00:30,694
Snaut told me about Gibarian.

430
01:00:31,531 --> 01:00:34,762
Then you already know the story.

431
01:00:34,834 --> 01:00:37,735
Yes, it's horrible.

432
01:00:38,538 --> 01:00:41,439
I don't know the details,
but he's dead.

433
01:00:41,507 --> 01:00:44,772
That's not the problem.
We all die.

434
01:00:44,944 --> 01:00:49,574
But he insisted on being buried on Earth.
Is space really such a bad grave for him?

435
01:00:50,349 --> 01:00:53,409
But Gibarian wanted to be
in the ground, with the worms.

436
01:00:53,486 --> 01:00:56,080
I wanted to disregard it,
but Snaut insisted.

437
01:00:56,155 --> 01:00:59,420
- Have you ever heard of Burton?
- He was the pilot who...

438
01:00:59,492 --> 01:01:02,484
Yes, he was in the search party
for Fechner.

439
01:01:02,595 --> 01:01:05,655
Fechner died a magnificent death,
but Gibarian was a coward.

440
01:01:05,731 --> 01:01:09,189
There's no point
talking badly of him now.

441
01:01:09,969 --> 01:01:13,302
It's at least worth talking about duty.

442
01:01:13,372 --> 01:01:15,135
Duty to whom?

443
01:01:15,208 --> 01:01:17,199
- To truth.
- You mean to people.

444
01:01:17,276 --> 01:01:20,074
You won't find truth there. Look.

445
01:01:25,651 --> 01:01:29,883
Your position is absurd.
Your so-called courage is inhuman!

446
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:32,553
You hear me?

447
01:01:38,531 --> 01:01:42,228
Go away.
You're too impressionable.

448
01:01:42,301 --> 01:01:45,828
You must get used to everything.
Good day.

449
01:04:49,622 --> 01:04:52,614
I spoke to Sartorius.

450
01:04:52,792 --> 01:04:55,090
He's a rotten person.

451
01:04:55,261 --> 01:04:57,855
He's a very talented scientist.

452
01:05:04,303 --> 01:05:08,501
I think I'm a little sick.

453
01:05:09,408 --> 01:05:13,742
There's nothing wrong with you.
You just won't take advice.

454
01:05:13,813 --> 01:05:18,307
Snaut, aside from the three of us,
is there anyone else on the station?

455
01:05:18,384 --> 01:05:20,284
Did you see someone?

456
01:05:22,188 --> 01:05:25,453
What were you warning me about?

457
01:05:25,524 --> 01:05:27,719
Whom did you see?

458
01:05:27,793 --> 01:05:31,320
Was it a human being?
Is she real?

459
01:05:32,498 --> 01:05:36,400
Can she be touched? Wounded?

460
01:05:38,003 --> 01:05:40,767
You saw her today.

461
01:05:42,875 --> 01:05:46,003
And you?
Who the hell are you?

462
01:05:51,717 --> 01:05:53,412
Quiet.

463
01:06:05,364 --> 01:06:08,299
- Where did she come from?
- Leave me alone.

464
01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:12,733
You're afraid.

465
01:06:17,176 --> 01:06:18,803
Don't worry.

466
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:23,044
I won't think you're insane.

467
01:06:23,115 --> 01:06:27,848
Insane?
God, you know absolutely nothing!

468
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,820
Insane...

469
01:06:30,656 --> 01:06:32,954
That would be a blessing.

470
01:06:40,065 --> 01:06:42,033
Listen, Snaut...

471
01:07:48,734 --> 01:07:50,292
<i>It's all so senseless.</i>

472
01:07:51,937 --> 01:07:56,135
<i>They won't understand me.
They think I've gone crazy.</i>

473
01:08:05,518 --> 01:08:07,748
<i>Do you see, Kris,
how it's not entirely absurd?</i>

474
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:11,221
<i>I have to do this because
I'm afraid they'll come in here.</i>

475
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:13,155
<i>I mean Snaut and Sartorius.</i>

476
01:08:13,225 --> 01:08:15,853
<i>They themselves don't understand
what they're doing.</i>

477
01:08:15,928 --> 01:08:18,453
<i>I'm afraid, Kris...</i>

478
01:08:19,098 --> 01:08:21,259
<i>I can't...</i>

479
01:08:22,034 --> 01:08:24,730
<i>Nobody will be able to understand.</i>

480
01:08:24,803 --> 01:08:28,102
<i>Open up! You hear, Gibarian?
Open up!</i>

481
01:08:28,173 --> 01:08:32,303
<i>Don't be stupid.
It's just us - Snaut and Sartorius.</i>

482
01:08:32,378 --> 01:08:34,539
<i>We want to help you.</i>

483
01:08:34,813 --> 01:08:37,213
<i>They want to help me.</i>

484
01:08:38,384 --> 01:08:41,046
<i>Just a second. Quit knocking.</i>

485
01:08:50,629 --> 01:08:53,097
<i>I am my own judge.</i>

486
01:08:56,302 --> 01:08:58,532
<i>Have you seen her?</i>

487
01:08:59,204 --> 01:09:02,970
<i>Kris, understand that
this is not madness.</i>

488
01:09:05,978 --> 01:09:10,972
<i>It has something to do
with conscience.</i>

489
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:25,522
<i>I really wanted you
to get here in time, Kris.</i>

490
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:13,218
Where did you?

491
01:14:17,923 --> 01:14:19,982
It's so nice.

492
01:14:33,038 --> 01:14:36,599
But... but it's not...

493
01:14:38,911 --> 01:14:41,471
How did you know where I?

494
01:14:41,613 --> 01:14:44,013
What do you mean, "how"?

495
01:14:50,522 --> 01:14:53,320
Don't, Kris. That tickles.

496
01:15:04,970 --> 01:15:07,939
Where are my shoes?
- Shoes?

497
01:15:24,056 --> 01:15:26,889
No. They're not there.

498
01:15:38,704 --> 01:15:40,535
Who's this?

499
01:15:59,658 --> 01:16:01,216
Kris...

500
01:16:03,128 --> 01:16:04,789
it's me.

501
01:16:14,539 --> 01:16:16,336
You know...

502
01:16:19,544 --> 01:16:22,035
I have the feeling...

503
01:16:26,051 --> 01:16:28,315
as if I've forgotten something.

504
01:16:39,297 --> 01:16:41,458
I can't understand it.

505
01:16:46,104 --> 01:16:47,765
Do you love me?

506
01:16:47,839 --> 01:16:52,105
Don't be silly, Hari.
As if you didn't know.

507
01:16:52,644 --> 01:16:55,477
I'm going out for a moment.
Wait for me, okay?

508
01:16:55,547 --> 01:16:59,677
- I'll go with you.
- No, Hari. I'll be back soon.

509
01:17:01,453 --> 01:17:03,114
No.

510
01:17:03,188 --> 01:17:05,713
What's with you? Why?

511
01:17:09,161 --> 01:17:12,324
I don't know. I can't.

512
01:17:12,397 --> 01:17:14,331
You can't what?

513
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:19,760
It feels like I...
I have to see you... all the time.

514
01:17:21,873 --> 01:17:24,205
What are you, a child?

515
01:17:24,276 --> 01:17:27,177
I have work to do, Hari.

516
01:17:34,686 --> 01:17:37,314
I'm behaving foolishly.

517
01:17:39,291 --> 01:17:41,225
And so are you.

518
01:17:41,293 --> 01:17:45,423
Running around all disheveled,
like Snaut.

519
01:17:46,631 --> 01:17:49,395
- Like who?
- Like Snaut.

520
01:17:51,536 --> 01:17:54,300
Listen, how do you...

521
01:17:57,909 --> 01:18:01,276
Well, I have to go.
If you want, we can go together.

522
01:18:02,914 --> 01:18:06,281
But you won't be able to get
into a suit with your dress on.

523
01:18:06,518 --> 01:18:08,452
Get undressed.

524
01:18:12,124 --> 01:18:15,059
Kris, help me. I can't undo it.

525
01:19:01,606 --> 01:19:03,870
Why are you looking at me like that?

526
01:19:23,195 --> 01:19:27,928
SOLARIS
Part Two

527
01:20:42,274 --> 01:20:44,105
Get in.

528
01:20:44,743 --> 01:20:46,540
- What about you?
- I'm right behind you.

529
01:20:46,611 --> 01:20:48,909
I have to shut the hatch.

530
01:20:51,716 --> 01:20:54,617
Is everything all right?
Are you comfortable?

531
01:20:54,686 --> 01:20:56,950
Yes. Hurry, Kris.

532
01:23:11,589 --> 01:23:13,489
You could at least knock.

533
01:23:13,558 --> 01:23:16,493
It sounded
like you were talking to someone.

534
01:23:16,795 --> 01:23:18,763
All the more reason.

535
01:23:18,997 --> 01:23:20,931
So you had guests?

536
01:23:20,999 --> 01:23:24,833
Well, I see you took
good care of them.

537
01:23:26,304 --> 01:23:29,740
It's nothing.
You won't die from it.

538
01:23:30,542 --> 01:23:33,102
Did you at least start out modestly?

539
01:23:33,278 --> 01:23:37,237
Narcotics, poisons, barbiturates, eh?

540
01:23:37,849 --> 01:23:41,114
If you plan to clown around,
you might as well leave.

541
01:23:41,186 --> 01:23:44,678
Sometimes you become a clown
without wanting to.

542
01:23:44,756 --> 01:23:48,954
Don't tell me you haven't tried
a rope or a hammer.

543
01:23:49,594 --> 01:23:53,462
Did you happen to throw
the inkwell like Luther? No?

544
01:24:02,106 --> 01:24:04,301
So,

545
01:24:05,043 --> 01:24:08,444
one, two, and into the rocket,

546
01:24:08,513 --> 01:24:10,310
and that was that.

547
01:24:11,082 --> 01:24:14,677
Next time, don't panic.

548
01:24:15,153 --> 01:24:19,385
And push the button from the corridor.
You could get burned.

549
01:24:19,891 --> 01:24:22,587
- What was that?
- I don't know.

550
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:26,221
Then again, we've managed
to determine a few things.

551
01:24:27,432 --> 01:24:29,127
Who was it?

552
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:32,829
She died 10 years ago.

553
01:24:33,605 --> 01:24:38,099
What you saw was the materialization
of your conception of her.

554
01:24:38,710 --> 01:24:41,702
What was her name?
- Hari.

555
01:24:50,321 --> 01:24:55,782
Everything began after we started
experimenting with radiation.

556
01:24:56,794 --> 01:25:00,753
We hit the Ocean's surface

557
01:25:00,832 --> 01:25:03,767
with strong X-ray beams.

558
01:25:05,270 --> 01:25:06,567
But it...

559
01:25:06,638 --> 01:25:11,075
Incidentally, consider yourself lucky.
After all, she's a part of your past.

560
01:25:11,442 --> 01:25:15,401
What if it had been something
you had never seen before,

561
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:18,108
but something you had thought
or imagined?

562
01:25:18,816 --> 01:25:20,408
I don't understand.

563
01:25:20,485 --> 01:25:24,319
Evidently the Ocean responded to
our heavy radiation with something else.

564
01:25:24,389 --> 01:25:29,224
It probed our minds and extracted
something like islands of memory.

565
01:25:34,299 --> 01:25:35,994
Will she come back?

566
01:25:36,067 --> 01:25:37,659
She will...

567
01:25:37,802 --> 01:25:39,827
and she won't.

568
01:25:43,641 --> 01:25:46,974
- Hari the Second.
- There may be an endless number of them.

569
01:25:47,045 --> 01:25:49,036
Why didn't you warn me?

570
01:25:49,113 --> 01:25:51,240
You wouldn't have believed me.

571
01:25:51,316 --> 01:25:55,980
I got scared and acted not entirely...

572
01:25:56,054 --> 01:25:59,455
Don't be hard on yourself.
We've had enough of Gibarian.

573
01:26:00,224 --> 01:26:03,387
There's talk about
liquidating the station.

574
01:26:03,928 --> 01:26:06,590
That's why I was sent here.

575
01:26:07,966 --> 01:26:11,959
If I submit a report, will you sign it?

576
01:26:12,203 --> 01:26:15,366
And what if we suddenly make
that long-awaited contact?

577
01:26:16,541 --> 01:26:22,104
Night is the best time here.
It somehow reminds me of Earth.

578
01:26:22,714 --> 01:26:26,150
Attach strips of paper
to the air-vents.

579
01:26:28,653 --> 01:26:34,148
At night it sounds like
the rustling of leaves.

580
01:26:34,826 --> 01:26:38,353
It was Gibarian's invention.
So simple, like all genius.

581
01:26:38,429 --> 01:26:40,420
I adopted it right away.

582
01:26:40,531 --> 01:26:44,968
Sartorius made fun of us,
but he has one in his room.

583
01:26:45,470 --> 01:26:48,268
He hides it in the closet.

584
01:26:49,641 --> 01:26:52,109
You should rest.

585
01:26:52,176 --> 01:26:55,873
If you can, come to the library later.

586
01:26:55,947 --> 01:26:59,212
I've prepared a list of books for you.

587
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:51,522
Snaut, is that you?

588
01:28:58,536 --> 01:29:02,302
Kris, where are you?

589
01:29:03,608 --> 01:29:05,803
Come here.

590
01:30:42,139 --> 01:30:45,768
- It's so dark.
- Come here. Don't be afraid.

591
01:31:42,199 --> 01:31:43,757
Hari!

592
01:31:43,834 --> 01:31:46,928
The door opens the other way.

593
01:32:43,828 --> 01:32:46,729
Hang on.
I'll be right back.

594
01:33:35,613 --> 01:33:39,208
When I saw you weren't there,
I got scared.

595
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:44,351
<i>Hello, Kris.</i>

596
01:33:45,689 --> 01:33:48,453
<i>I can barely hear you.
Speak louder.</i>

597
01:33:49,326 --> 01:33:51,590
<i>What are you doing right now?</i>

598
01:33:52,863 --> 01:33:54,831
Nothing.

599
01:33:54,999 --> 01:33:59,299
<i>Sartorius has invited us
to his laboratory.</i>

600
01:33:59,737 --> 01:34:01,466
<i>How are you?</i>

601
01:34:01,539 --> 01:34:04,133
Fine. I'll try to make it.

602
01:34:18,222 --> 01:34:21,157
Kris, what's wrong with me?

603
01:34:36,707 --> 01:34:40,234
Maybe it's epilepsy?

604
01:35:34,865 --> 01:35:36,924
This is my wife.

605
01:35:38,903 --> 01:35:40,598
Hello.

606
01:35:43,607 --> 01:35:45,632
Hello.

607
01:35:47,912 --> 01:35:50,904
- We've been waiting for you.
- I was busy.

608
01:35:52,583 --> 01:35:56,280
- How lovely! Are these yours?
- No, they're Snaut's.

609
01:35:57,888 --> 01:36:03,656
So, as far as I can tell,
they are constructed...

610
01:36:03,727 --> 01:36:05,854
Let's just call them "guests."

611
01:36:05,930 --> 01:36:07,693
Fine.

612
01:36:08,165 --> 01:36:12,966
While our structure is made of atoms,
theirs consists of neutrinos.

613
01:36:13,204 --> 01:36:17,504
But neutrino systems are unstable.

614
01:36:17,942 --> 01:36:21,434
They seem to be stabilized
by Solaris' force field.

615
01:36:26,650 --> 01:36:29,312
You've got a superb specimen.

616
01:36:30,621 --> 01:36:32,851
That's my wife.

617
01:36:33,057 --> 01:36:35,958
Wonderful. Perfect.

618
01:36:39,196 --> 01:36:42,495
Then take a blood sample
from your wife.

619
01:36:42,566 --> 01:36:44,227
Why?

620
01:36:44,335 --> 01:36:46,530
It'll sober you up a bit.

621
01:37:21,905 --> 01:37:24,738
What do you think?

622
01:37:26,343 --> 01:37:28,777
- Snaut?
- Enough of all of you!

623
01:37:30,981 --> 01:37:33,973
I burned the blood with acid,
but it's restoring itself.

624
01:37:34,051 --> 01:37:35,643
Regeneration?

625
01:37:35,719 --> 01:37:41,055
In essence, immortality-
Faust's problem.

626
01:37:41,125 --> 01:37:42,820
Excuse me.

627
01:37:46,964 --> 01:37:49,364
There's no need for cotton.

628
01:37:50,434 --> 01:37:53,460
Are you qualified
to perform an autopsy?

629
01:37:53,537 --> 01:37:56,597
I've already told you -she's my wife.
Don't you understand?

630
01:37:56,774 --> 01:38:00,369
I think these experiments are
more humane than testing on rabbits.

631
01:38:01,111 --> 01:38:02,476
Don't you agree?

632
01:38:02,546 --> 01:38:04,537
It doesn't matter.

633
01:38:04,615 --> 01:38:06,810
It would be like
cutting my own leg off.

634
01:38:08,319 --> 01:38:10,913
Did you feel pain
when you broke through the door?

635
01:38:10,988 --> 01:38:13,616
Pain? Of course.

636
01:38:13,924 --> 01:38:17,155
So if I ever catch you doing anything...

637
01:38:17,227 --> 01:38:19,889
- You're lucky.
- How so?

638
01:38:20,764 --> 01:38:22,857
It's meaningless,

639
01:38:22,933 --> 01:38:25,493
yet you've managed to establish
emotional contact with them.

640
01:38:25,569 --> 01:38:28,766
It may be pleasant...
- What are you, jealous?

641
01:38:29,039 --> 01:38:30,597
Maybe I'm jealous.

642
01:38:30,674 --> 01:38:33,302
No, you're not jealous.
After all, you're not guilty of anything.

643
01:38:33,377 --> 01:38:35,436
- Of course.
- But I am guilty.

644
01:38:35,512 --> 01:38:37,104
Of what?

645
01:38:37,414 --> 01:38:41,441
When you turn into an utter cripple
with no arms or legs, call us.

646
01:38:41,985 --> 01:38:45,318
We'll empty your chamber pot.

647
01:38:45,589 --> 01:38:49,218
- But whom have you wronged?
- You, among others.

648
01:39:35,572 --> 01:39:39,008
My father shot that.
Well, I shot a bit.

649
01:42:34,418 --> 01:42:36,113
Listen...

650
01:42:53,804 --> 01:42:56,034
I don't know myself at all.

651
01:42:57,541 --> 01:42:59,600
I don't remember.

652
01:43:00,711 --> 01:43:05,205
When I close my eyes,
I can't recall my face. And you?

653
01:43:05,515 --> 01:43:07,244
What?

654
01:43:08,518 --> 01:43:12,181
- Do you know yourself?
- Like all humans.

655
01:43:22,432 --> 01:43:26,630
That woman in the white coat hated me.

656
01:43:26,703 --> 01:43:31,003
Don't make things up.
She died before you and I met.

657
01:43:32,976 --> 01:43:35,809
I don't understand
why you're deceiving me.

658
01:43:36,713 --> 01:43:38,908
I remember perfectly.

659
01:43:39,182 --> 01:43:43,278
We drank tea and she kicked me out.

660
01:43:44,121 --> 01:43:47,488
Naturally, I stood up and left.
I remember perfectly.

661
01:43:48,892 --> 01:43:51,122
What happened after that?

662
01:43:52,696 --> 01:43:54,857
After that, I went away,

663
01:43:55,432 --> 01:43:58,401
and we never saw each other again.

664
01:43:58,769 --> 01:44:00,669
Where did you go?

665
01:44:00,937 --> 01:44:02,871
To a different city.

666
01:44:03,073 --> 01:44:05,735
- Why?
- I was transferred.

667
01:44:06,710 --> 01:44:09,201
Why did you leave without me?

668
01:44:11,314 --> 01:44:13,441
You didn't want to come.

669
01:44:16,086 --> 01:44:18,281
That I remember.

670
01:45:16,246 --> 01:45:20,376
Forgive me.
I thought you were already awake.

671
01:45:20,450 --> 01:45:22,213
What happened?

672
01:45:22,285 --> 01:45:24,549
The regeneration is slowing down.

673
01:45:24,621 --> 01:45:28,455
For two or three hours
we can be free of them.

674
01:45:28,725 --> 01:45:31,694
You came in the middle of the night
to tell me that?

675
01:45:32,462 --> 01:45:36,398
I'll tell you why I came.

676
01:45:36,867 --> 01:45:39,358
Sartorius and I were thinking:

677
01:45:39,803 --> 01:45:43,967
If the Ocean derives guests from us
while we dream,

678
01:45:44,508 --> 01:45:47,909
maybe it makes sense to transmit
our waking thoughts to it.

679
01:45:48,111 --> 01:45:51,342
- How?
- With beams of radiation.

680
01:45:52,115 --> 01:45:55,812
Perhaps it will understand
and spare us from all these apparitions.

681
01:45:55,952 --> 01:45:59,615
Again these ridiculous X-ray sermons
about the greatness of science?

682
01:45:59,823 --> 01:46:03,953
We'll modulate the beam
with the brain waves of one of us.

683
01:46:04,027 --> 01:46:06,393
And "one of us" means me, of course.

684
01:46:07,430 --> 01:46:11,332
An encephalogram!
A transcription of all my thoughts!

685
01:46:11,434 --> 01:46:15,837
What if I suddenly want her to die?
To disappear!

686
01:46:16,006 --> 01:46:19,669
Entrust everything to that...
that mass of jelly?

687
01:46:19,843 --> 01:46:22,471
It's already invaded my soul.

688
01:46:22,546 --> 01:46:25,447
Kris, we're running out of time.

689
01:46:25,549 --> 01:46:30,213
Sartorius has proposed
another project: the annihilator.

690
01:46:30,420 --> 01:46:34,083
Self-destruction
of the neutrino systems.

691
01:46:36,159 --> 01:46:38,923
What is this? Blackmail?

692
01:46:39,229 --> 01:46:42,665
I convinced him to start
with the encephalogram.

693
01:46:43,099 --> 01:46:47,502
But forget about this for now.

694
01:46:48,705 --> 01:46:52,698
Tomorrow's my birthday.
Consider yourself invited.

695
01:46:52,843 --> 01:46:55,676
- Liar! You just want to make up with us.
- Yes, I do.

696
01:46:55,745 --> 01:46:58,339
Don't shout. She sleeping.

697
01:47:01,618 --> 01:47:03,415
Sleeping?

698
01:47:04,221 --> 01:47:07,213
She's already learned how to sleep?

699
01:47:08,091 --> 01:47:10,958
This will all end badly.

700
01:47:11,127 --> 01:47:14,028
- Well, what do you propose I do?
- Nothing.

701
01:47:14,264 --> 01:47:17,631
So you'll come?
Tomorrow, in the library.

702
01:47:21,404 --> 01:47:23,964
We'll set the table.

703
01:47:24,507 --> 01:47:29,206
At least there are no windows in there.

704
01:47:29,546 --> 01:47:31,605
In the meantime, let's go.

705
01:47:32,249 --> 01:47:34,274
Sartorius is waiting.

706
01:47:37,254 --> 01:47:38,949
She's sleeping.

707
01:47:39,089 --> 01:47:41,250
Will she follow me?

708
01:47:42,292 --> 01:47:44,886
Don't lock the door.

709
01:47:47,731 --> 01:47:49,494
What door?

710
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:53,068
It's just an apparition.

711
01:48:47,691 --> 01:48:49,682
Wait. I'll be right back.

712
01:48:50,427 --> 01:48:52,122
Where are you going?

713
01:49:27,597 --> 01:49:31,055
Forgive me.

714
01:50:27,157 --> 01:50:29,216
Why aren't you asleep?

715
01:50:33,229 --> 01:50:36,528
- You don't love me.
- Stop it, Hari.

716
01:50:39,169 --> 01:50:42,002
- We have to talk.
- About what?

717
01:50:46,776 --> 01:50:50,075
You understand that I don't know
where I came from.

718
01:50:50,613 --> 01:50:53,173
Maybe you know?
- What's with you?

719
01:50:53,249 --> 01:50:55,683
Stop. Don't interrupt.

720
01:50:56,953 --> 01:50:58,978
If you know,

721
01:51:00,290 --> 01:51:03,350
but you can't tell me now,

722
01:51:03,927 --> 01:51:06,953
perhaps one day you will.

723
01:51:07,630 --> 01:51:09,461
What are you talking about?

724
01:51:09,632 --> 01:51:12,260
I don't understand a thing, honestly.

725
01:51:13,436 --> 01:51:15,631
You don't want to tell me.

726
01:51:17,140 --> 01:51:19,370
You're afraid.

727
01:51:20,110 --> 01:51:22,840
Then I'll tell you.

728
01:51:24,714 --> 01:51:26,443
I'm not Hari.

729
01:51:27,484 --> 01:51:29,850
Hari is dead.

730
01:51:30,386 --> 01:51:32,786
She poisoned herself.

731
01:51:33,923 --> 01:51:36,949
I'm somebody else.

732
01:51:37,026 --> 01:51:39,051
Who told you this?

733
01:51:39,696 --> 01:51:42,893
- Sartorius just told me.
- Last night.

734
01:51:46,803 --> 01:51:49,499
It would have been better
if you had told me yourself.

735
01:51:49,706 --> 01:51:52,641
My God, what's the difference?

736
01:51:58,014 --> 01:52:00,710
How have you lived all this time?

737
01:52:01,751 --> 01:52:03,742
Were you in love with anyone?

738
01:52:03,820 --> 01:52:05,515
I don't know.

739
01:52:05,588 --> 01:52:07,419
Did you ever think of me?

740
01:52:07,624 --> 01:52:10,752
Yes, but not all the time.

741
01:52:12,962 --> 01:52:15,453
Only when I felt unhappy.

742
01:52:21,638 --> 01:52:26,337
You know, it feels like
somebody is tricking us.

743
01:52:28,144 --> 01:52:33,172
And the longer this fog lasts,
the worse it will be for you in the end.

744
01:52:33,516 --> 01:52:35,916
Particularly for you, Kris.

745
01:52:37,453 --> 01:52:39,478
How can I help you?

746
01:52:41,858 --> 01:52:43,348
Tell me.

747
01:52:43,493 --> 01:52:49,159
And her, the other one,
what happened to her?

748
01:52:58,074 --> 01:52:59,905
We argued.

749
01:53:00,810 --> 01:53:03,836
Towards the end, we argued a lot.

750
01:53:04,047 --> 01:53:07,016
I gathered my things and left.

751
01:53:08,384 --> 01:53:11,842
She made me understand
without saying it directly,

752
01:53:12,522 --> 01:53:16,754
but when you live with someone for a
long time, such things aren't necessary.

753
01:53:18,428 --> 01:53:20,555
I was sure they were just words,

754
01:53:20,630 --> 01:53:23,690
but then I remembered that I'd left

755
01:53:25,702 --> 01:53:28,330
the laboratory specimens
in the refrigerator.

756
01:53:29,973 --> 01:53:34,137
I had brought them from the laboratory
and explained how they worked.

757
01:53:34,210 --> 01:53:35,973
I got scared.

758
01:53:36,446 --> 01:53:38,812
I wanted to go to her.

759
01:53:38,915 --> 01:53:42,749
But then I thought it would look like
I had taken her words seriously.

760
01:53:43,253 --> 01:53:46,416
After three days, I couldn't take it
anymore and I went to see her.

761
01:53:46,589 --> 01:53:49,683
When I got there,
she was already dead.

762
01:53:50,159 --> 01:53:52,992
There was a needle mark on her arm.

763
01:53:55,365 --> 01:53:57,356
Like this?

764
01:54:05,975 --> 01:54:08,637
Why did she do it?

765
01:54:09,812 --> 01:54:14,078
She probably sensed
that I didn't really love her.

766
01:54:18,488 --> 01:54:20,388
But now I do.

767
01:54:32,235 --> 01:54:34,226
- Kris.
- What?

768
01:54:35,171 --> 01:54:37,002
I love you.

769
01:54:42,578 --> 01:54:44,842
Get some sleep.

770
01:54:44,914 --> 01:54:46,848
I don't know how to sleep.

771
01:54:48,651 --> 01:54:54,021
It's not sleep.
It's somehow around me.

772
01:54:56,492 --> 01:55:01,327
It's as if it weren't just inside of me,
but much farther away.

773
01:55:01,964 --> 01:55:06,128
It's probably still sleep.

774
01:55:46,642 --> 01:55:50,078
So, it looks like our guest of honor
isn't showing up.

775
01:55:54,150 --> 01:55:57,483
- Why?
- Maybe he has guests.

776
01:56:53,543 --> 01:56:56,376
Oh, everyone's already here?

777
01:56:59,682 --> 01:57:02,776
You're an hour and a half late.

778
01:57:09,358 --> 01:57:11,883
What's that you're reading?

779
01:57:17,567 --> 01:57:19,797
It's all rubbish.

780
01:57:22,038 --> 01:57:23,835
Rubbish.

781
01:57:25,675 --> 01:57:27,540
Where the hell is...

782
01:57:33,349 --> 01:57:35,078
Here!

783
01:57:38,354 --> 01:57:41,255
"They come at night.

784
01:57:42,959 --> 01:57:45,928
But one must sleep sometime."

785
01:57:47,029 --> 01:57:49,429
That's the problem.

786
01:57:50,766 --> 01:57:54,668
Mankind has lost the ability to sleep.

787
01:58:00,710 --> 01:58:05,773
You'd better read.
I'm a little excited.

788
01:58:08,084 --> 01:58:11,019
"I know only one thing, señor.
When I...

789
01:58:22,598 --> 01:58:26,932
When I sleep, I know no fear,
no hope, no trouble, no bliss.

790
01:58:27,003 --> 01:58:29,198
Blessings on him who invented sleep.

791
01:58:31,607 --> 01:58:35,202
The common coin
that purchases all things,

792
01:58:35,278 --> 01:58:37,303
the balance that levels
shepherd and king,

793
01:58:37,380 --> 01:58:39,610
fool and wise man.

794
01:58:39,682 --> 01:58:42,276
There is only one bad thing
about sound sleep.

795
01:58:42,351 --> 01:58:45,514
They say it closely resembles death."

796
01:58:45,588 --> 01:58:50,423
"Never before, Sancho, have I heard you
speak so elegantly as now."

797
01:58:53,362 --> 01:58:58,459
That's great, but perhaps
you'll let me say something now?

798
01:58:59,468 --> 01:59:02,232
I propose a toast to Snaut,

799
01:59:02,838 --> 01:59:07,639
to his bravery,
to his devotion to duty.

800
01:59:07,710 --> 01:59:10,508
To science and to Snaut.

801
01:59:10,813 --> 01:59:14,078
Science? Nonsense.

802
01:59:15,318 --> 01:59:21,188
In this situation, mediocrity and genius
are equally useless.

803
01:59:22,358 --> 01:59:27,660
We have no interest
in conquering any cosmos.

804
01:59:28,497 --> 01:59:32,627
We want to extend the Earth
to the borders of the cosmos.

805
01:59:33,336 --> 01:59:35,804
We don't know what to do
with other worlds.

806
01:59:35,871 --> 01:59:38,431
We don't need other worlds.

807
01:59:38,574 --> 01:59:41,634
We need a mirror.

808
01:59:42,011 --> 01:59:46,072
We struggle for contact,
but we'll never find it.

809
01:59:46,549 --> 01:59:49,074
We're in the foolish human
predicament

810
01:59:49,151 --> 01:59:53,019
of striving for a goal that he fears,

811
01:59:53,189 --> 01:59:55,282
that he has no need for.

812
01:59:56,125 --> 02:00:00,289
Man needs man.

813
02:00:07,937 --> 02:00:10,235
Let's drink to Gibarian.

814
02:00:10,406 --> 02:00:12,374
To his memory.

815
02:00:12,441 --> 02:00:15,604
Even though he got frightened.

816
02:00:28,224 --> 02:00:31,125
No, Gibarian was not frightened.

817
02:00:34,430 --> 02:00:37,126
There are worse things.

818
02:00:39,435 --> 02:00:42,632
He died of hopelessness.

819
02:00:44,573 --> 02:00:48,009
He thought all this
was happening only to him.

820
02:00:48,077 --> 02:00:50,102
My God!

821
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:52,973
All these heartbreaking lamentations

822
02:00:53,049 --> 02:00:55,176
are nothing but
second-rate Dostoyevsky.

823
02:00:56,018 --> 02:00:57,918
Who are you to judge?

824
02:00:57,987 --> 02:01:00,683
I know why I'm here.
I'm working.

825
02:01:01,424 --> 02:01:04,018
Man was created by nature
so he could learn her ways.

826
02:01:06,328 --> 02:01:10,025
In his endless search for the truth,
man is condemned to knowledge.

827
02:01:10,466 --> 02:01:12,832
Everything else is whim.

828
02:01:14,236 --> 02:01:16,670
Permit me to ask,
my esteemed colleague:

829
02:01:16,739 --> 02:01:19,333
Why have you come to Solaris?

830
02:01:20,342 --> 02:01:24,005
- What do you mean, why?
- Well, are you working a lot?

831
02:01:24,080 --> 02:01:27,243
Forgive me, but aside from
the romance with your ex-wife,

832
02:01:27,316 --> 02:01:29,580
nothing seems to interest you.

833
02:01:29,652 --> 02:01:32,883
You spend all day lounging in
a bed of noble thoughts,

834
02:01:32,955 --> 02:01:35,856
and that's how
you carry out your duty.

835
02:01:36,092 --> 02:01:38,959
You've lost touch with reality.

836
02:01:39,228 --> 02:01:41,458
Forgive me, but you're simply a loafer.

837
02:01:41,530 --> 02:01:43,122
Enough!

838
02:01:43,199 --> 02:01:46,862
Let's try to be pleasant.
We'll drink to Gibarian.

839
02:01:46,936 --> 02:01:49,029
Not to Gibarian, but to Man.

840
02:01:49,105 --> 02:01:51,266
Are you saying
Gibarian was not a man?

841
02:01:51,340 --> 02:01:54,798
Stop it, Kris.
Let's not fight.

842
02:01:54,977 --> 02:01:59,812
After all, it's my birthday.
It's my day.

843
02:01:59,915 --> 02:02:01,644
Of course.

844
02:02:02,651 --> 02:02:05,950
I think that Kris Kelvin

845
02:02:07,123 --> 02:02:10,092
is more consistent than both of you.

846
02:02:10,226 --> 02:02:13,320
In inhuman conditions,
he has behaved humanely.

847
02:02:13,395 --> 02:02:16,956
And you act
as if none of this concerns you,

848
02:02:17,032 --> 02:02:21,935
and consider your guests -
it seems that's what you call us -

849
02:02:22,004 --> 02:02:25,098
something external, a hindrance.

850
02:02:25,441 --> 02:02:29,377
But it's a part of you.
It's your conscience.

851
02:02:33,215 --> 02:02:35,513
And Kris loves me.

852
02:02:38,854 --> 02:02:41,880
Maybe it's not me he loves,

853
02:02:42,558 --> 02:02:46,221
but he's simply protecting himself.

854
02:02:47,296 --> 02:02:49,924
He wants me alive.

855
02:02:50,699 --> 02:02:53,167
That's not the point.
It doesn't matter why man loves.

856
02:02:53,235 --> 02:02:55,294
It's different for everyone.

857
02:02:55,704 --> 02:02:58,366
It's not Kris.

858
02:02:58,841 --> 02:03:00,570
It's you.

859
02:03:00,643 --> 02:03:03,578
I hate you all.
- I would ask you...

860
02:03:03,646 --> 02:03:07,173
Please don't interrupt me.
I'm a woman, after all.

861
02:03:07,249 --> 02:03:09,308
You're not a woman
and you're not a human being.

862
02:03:09,385 --> 02:03:11,285
Understand that,

863
02:03:11,353 --> 02:03:14,288
if you're capable
of understanding anything.

864
02:03:16,759 --> 02:03:19,751
There is no Hari. She's dead.

865
02:03:22,965 --> 02:03:26,594
You're just a reproduction,

866
02:03:27,036 --> 02:03:29,470
a mechanical reproduction.

867
02:03:29,538 --> 02:03:32,632
A copy. A matrix.

868
02:03:41,450 --> 02:03:43,042
Yes.

869
02:03:45,387 --> 02:03:47,355
Maybe.

870
02:03:56,265 --> 02:03:57,926
But I...

871
02:03:58,500 --> 02:04:02,027
I am becoming a human being.

872
02:04:05,674 --> 02:04:08,666
I can feel just as deeply as you.

873
02:04:10,012 --> 02:04:12,105
Believe me.

874
02:04:14,250 --> 02:04:17,151
I can already get by without him.

875
02:04:18,888 --> 02:04:20,321
I...

876
02:04:23,459 --> 02:04:25,359
love him.

877
02:04:27,596 --> 02:04:29,894
I am a human being.

878
02:04:30,633 --> 02:04:32,123
You...

879
02:04:33,469 --> 02:04:36,029
you're very cruel.

880
02:05:30,726 --> 02:05:33,286
Get up! Get up right now!

881
02:05:41,537 --> 02:05:43,596
My dear man.

882
02:05:49,044 --> 02:05:51,604
Nothing could be easier.

883
02:05:55,851 --> 02:05:58,513
We've wasted time arguing.

884
02:05:59,254 --> 02:06:03,850
We're losing our dignity
and human character.

885
02:06:04,760 --> 02:06:06,227
No.

886
02:06:06,428 --> 02:06:10,865
You're human, each in your own way.

887
02:06:12,001 --> 02:06:14,561
That's why you argue.

888
02:06:15,971 --> 02:06:18,371
I hope I'm not bothering you.

889
02:06:22,144 --> 02:06:24,635
You're a good man...

890
02:06:24,947 --> 02:06:28,314
but you look awful.

891
02:06:35,557 --> 02:06:38,025
I've really lost heart.

892
02:06:39,194 --> 02:06:42,254
Help me out a bit.

893
02:06:46,301 --> 02:06:51,534
Doesn't a man
who's ready to give up his life

894
02:06:51,607 --> 02:06:56,544
just to make cursed contact

895
02:06:56,612 --> 02:07:00,241
in order to know more about it
have the right to get drunk?

896
02:07:00,315 --> 02:07:03,751
He has every right.

897
02:07:05,354 --> 02:07:09,256
Do you believe in our mission, Kelvin?

898
02:07:10,659 --> 02:07:12,627
I'm not going to bed yet.

899
02:07:12,828 --> 02:07:15,228
It's important not to fall asleep.

900
02:07:15,998 --> 02:07:18,660
I'm going to see Faust.

901
02:07:19,835 --> 02:07:23,703
In the laboratory, our Faust-
Sartorius -

902
02:07:23,772 --> 02:07:26,798
is seeking a remedy for immortality.

903
02:07:26,875 --> 02:07:28,740
While we...

904
02:07:41,890 --> 02:07:47,419
Listen, let's open these hatches
and shout down below.

905
02:07:47,896 --> 02:07:50,421
It would suddenly hear.

906
02:07:50,866 --> 02:07:54,495
But what should we call it?

907
02:07:55,938 --> 02:08:01,069
Maybe we should whip it.

908
02:08:01,844 --> 02:08:04,404
Or, better yet, pray to it.

909
02:08:04,480 --> 02:08:05,970
What's wrong?

910
02:08:06,048 --> 02:08:08,744
I think I shut the door to the library.
She's there alone.

911
02:08:08,817 --> 02:08:11,217
Go. I feel better already.

912
02:08:11,286 --> 02:08:13,720
The station is changing its orbit.

913
02:08:14,223 --> 02:08:19,820
At 5 a.m. there will be
30 seconds of weightlessness.

914
02:08:20,329 --> 02:08:22,763
Don't forget.

915
02:11:45,033 --> 02:11:47,900
Forgive me, my darling.
I was lost in thought.

916
02:11:50,072 --> 02:11:52,438
Is something wrong?

917
02:11:53,608 --> 02:11:56,702
No, nothing.

918
02:11:57,913 --> 02:12:00,040
Everything's fine.

919
02:15:52,514 --> 02:15:54,778
She drank liquid oxygen.

920
02:15:56,818 --> 02:15:59,480
She did it out of despair.

921
02:15:59,754 --> 02:16:01,881
It'll get worse.

922
02:16:01,957 --> 02:16:05,324
The more she's with you,
the more human she'll become.

923
02:16:05,860 --> 02:16:09,421
Learn from Sartorius' example.
- Thanks for the advice.

924
02:16:14,069 --> 02:16:16,299
What do you intend to do?

925
02:16:16,471 --> 02:16:19,338
Wait until she returns.

926
02:16:19,507 --> 02:16:22,670
And then what?
Leave the station?

927
02:16:27,048 --> 02:16:32,452
Kris, she can only live here,
on the station. You know that.

928
02:16:33,989 --> 02:16:36,287
What can I do?

929
02:16:36,791 --> 02:16:38,520
I love her.
- Which one?

930
02:16:38,593 --> 02:16:43,724
Her, or the one in the rocket?
You can pull her in from space.

931
02:16:43,798 --> 02:16:46,392
She will appear again
and she'll keep appearing.

932
02:16:47,435 --> 02:16:51,201
Don't turn a scientific problem
into a common love story.

933
02:16:55,276 --> 02:16:58,143
I had a feeling this would end badly.

934
02:17:02,450 --> 02:17:04,350
You should help her.

935
02:17:21,169 --> 02:17:23,296
What a ghastly sight.

936
02:17:24,572 --> 02:17:30,238
I can never get used
to all these resurrections.

937
02:19:22,724 --> 02:19:24,851
Is it me?

938
02:19:29,197 --> 02:19:30,323
Hari...

939
02:19:31,366 --> 02:19:32,799
What?

940
02:19:38,973 --> 02:19:40,634
Why?

941
02:19:42,177 --> 02:19:43,838
Why?

942
02:19:46,815 --> 02:19:49,750
No, it's not me.

943
02:19:54,355 --> 02:19:56,789
It's... I'm... not Hari...

944
02:19:56,858 --> 02:20:01,761
And you... Maybe you...

945
02:20:02,096 --> 02:20:04,963
- Don't, Hari.
- I'm not Hari!

946
02:20:07,635 --> 02:20:09,933
Fine!

947
02:20:10,004 --> 02:20:12,700
Maybe your appearance
is supposed to be torture.

948
02:20:12,774 --> 02:20:14,537
Maybe it's a favor from the Ocean.

949
02:20:14,609 --> 02:20:19,546
What does it matter
when you're worth more to me

950
02:20:19,614 --> 02:20:21,980
than any science could ever be?

951
02:20:22,917 --> 02:20:24,680
Do I look a lot like her?

952
02:20:24,752 --> 02:20:27,915
No, you looked like her.

953
02:20:27,989 --> 02:20:31,356
But now you -and not her-
are the real Hari.

954
02:20:31,459 --> 02:20:34,189
Tell me...

955
02:20:34,863 --> 02:20:39,163
Do I disgust you? I'm so...

956
02:20:43,905 --> 02:20:46,897
I disgust you!
- No, Hari. That's not true.

957
02:20:46,975 --> 02:20:49,205
- You're lying!
- It's not true. Stop it.

958
02:20:49,277 --> 02:20:51,802
- I must be disgusting!
- Stop it.

959
02:20:58,887 --> 02:21:00,752
Don't touch me!

960
02:21:49,904 --> 02:21:52,202
I love you.

961
02:21:56,411 --> 02:21:58,436
What's the matter?

962
02:22:02,483 --> 02:22:05,782
Nothing.

963
02:22:11,726 --> 02:22:14,388
I'm not going back to Earth.

964
02:22:14,963 --> 02:22:19,195
I'll live here with you on the station.

965
02:22:19,968 --> 02:22:21,663
You know...

966
02:22:25,473 --> 02:22:27,839
I'm afraid.

967
02:24:36,070 --> 02:24:38,732
It looks like it's showing
some activity.

968
02:24:38,806 --> 02:24:41,468
Your encephalogram helped.

969
02:24:42,944 --> 02:24:44,673
You know...

970
02:24:44,846 --> 02:24:49,374
whenever we show pity,
we ravage ourselves.

971
02:24:49,684 --> 02:24:52,152
Maybe it's true...

972
02:24:52,353 --> 02:24:57,222
Suffering makes life seem

973
02:24:57,391 --> 02:24:59,621
dismal and suspect.

974
02:25:03,664 --> 02:25:05,962
But I won't accept that.

975
02:25:09,770 --> 02:25:12,330
No, I won't accept that.

976
02:25:17,011 --> 02:25:22,847
Is that which is indispensable to life
also harmful to it?

977
02:25:24,018 --> 02:25:28,921
No, it's not harmful.
Of course it's not harmful.

978
02:25:30,091 --> 02:25:32,286
Remember Tolstoy?

979
02:25:32,994 --> 02:25:37,761
His suffering over the impossibility
of loving mankind as a whole?

980
02:25:40,468 --> 02:25:43,801
How much time has passed since then?

981
02:25:44,405 --> 02:25:48,398
Somehow I can't figure it out.
Help me.

982
02:25:51,179 --> 02:25:53,204
See, I love you.

983
02:25:53,281 --> 02:25:57,411
But love is a feeling
we can experience

984
02:25:57,485 --> 02:26:00,113
but never explain.

985
02:26:00,421 --> 02:26:02,582
One can explain the concept.

986
02:26:02,657 --> 02:26:05,717
You love that which you can lose:

987
02:26:05,793 --> 02:26:09,126
Yourself, a woman, a homeland.

988
02:26:10,064 --> 02:26:15,297
Until today, love was simply
unattainable to mankind, to the Earth.

989
02:26:15,369 --> 02:26:17,394
Do you understand me, Snaut?

990
02:26:17,471 --> 02:26:21,931
There are so few of us.
A few billion altogether. A handful!

991
02:26:23,377 --> 02:26:27,939
Maybe we're here in order
to experience people

992
02:26:28,449 --> 02:26:30,110
as a reason for love.

993
02:26:35,756 --> 02:26:38,054
He seems to have a fever.

994
02:26:39,393 --> 02:26:44,023
How did Gibarian die?
You still haven't told me.

995
02:26:44,565 --> 02:26:47,227
I'll tell you. Later.

996
02:26:47,969 --> 02:26:52,030
Gibarian didn't die of fear.
He died of shame.

997
02:26:52,106 --> 02:26:57,305
Shame-the feeling
that will save mankind.

998
02:29:25,359 --> 02:29:27,350
Mama, I...

999
02:29:30,631 --> 02:29:33,031
I'm two hours late.

1000
02:29:33,100 --> 02:29:34,829
I know.

1001
02:29:35,936 --> 02:29:37,767
How was your trip?

1002
02:29:38,739 --> 02:29:43,642
Fine. I'm a little tired,
but it was fine.

1003
02:29:59,160 --> 02:30:03,893
My God, it's running slow again.

1004
02:30:04,765 --> 02:30:06,460
I'll go adjust it.

1005
02:30:06,534 --> 02:30:08,593
You've got plenty of time.

1006
02:30:36,330 --> 02:30:40,664
You know, it's really embarrassing,
but for some reason...

1007
02:30:44,171 --> 02:30:47,299
I've completely forgotten your face.

1008
02:30:48,142 --> 02:30:50,474
You don't look well.

1009
02:30:52,580 --> 02:30:53,740
Are you happy?

1010
02:30:53,814 --> 02:30:57,545
Somehow that concept
seems irrelevant here.

1011
02:30:58,919 --> 02:31:02,685
That's really a pity.

1012
02:31:06,494 --> 02:31:09,361
I'm very lonesome now.

1013
02:31:21,509 --> 02:31:24,569
Why do you hurt our feelings?

1014
02:31:24,645 --> 02:31:26,442
What have you been waiting for?

1015
02:31:27,581 --> 02:31:30,277
Why haven't you called?

1016
02:31:48,302 --> 02:31:51,271
You're leading
some sort of strange life.

1017
02:31:51,972 --> 02:31:55,305
You're filthy and unkempt.

1018
02:31:57,011 --> 02:31:59,605
How did you make
such a mess of yourself?

1019
02:32:04,685 --> 02:32:06,676
What's this?

1020
02:32:08,422 --> 02:32:10,913
Wait here. I'll be right back.

1021
02:34:08,142 --> 02:34:11,270
How are you?
Everything all right?

1022
02:34:11,345 --> 02:34:13,438
Where's Hari?

1023
02:34:24,758 --> 02:34:26,555
What's that?

1024
02:34:26,827 --> 02:34:29,193
There's no more Hari.

1025
02:34:53,320 --> 02:34:58,519
"Kris, it's terrible that I had
to deceive you,

1026
02:34:58,592 --> 02:35:01,152
but there was no other way.

1027
02:35:02,629 --> 02:35:05,496
This is best for both of us.

1028
02:35:11,205 --> 02:35:14,174
I asked them myself.

1029
02:35:15,175 --> 02:35:18,906
You mustn't blame anyone.

1030
02:35:20,714 --> 02:35:22,579
Hari."

1031
02:35:26,887 --> 02:35:29,253
She did it for you.

1032
02:35:39,733 --> 02:35:42,634
Snaut, listen.

1033
02:35:43,904 --> 02:35:46,338
Later, Kris. Calm down.

1034
02:35:47,007 --> 02:35:50,602
How... how did it...

1035
02:35:51,979 --> 02:35:55,608
The annihilator?
A burst of light and wind.

1036
02:36:05,159 --> 02:36:07,093
Yes.

1037
02:36:07,795 --> 02:36:11,526
Things weren't working out
between us towards the end.

1038
02:36:16,136 --> 02:36:18,297
Listen, Snaut.

1039
02:36:19,039 --> 02:36:22,406
Why are we being tortured like this?

1040
02:36:24,411 --> 02:36:29,110
In my opinion, we have lost
our sense of the cosmic.

1041
02:36:29,516 --> 02:36:31,711
The ancients understood it perfectly.

1042
02:36:31,785 --> 02:36:35,516
They never would have asked
why or what for.

1043
02:36:35,956 --> 02:36:38,686
Remember the myth of Sisyphus.

1044
02:36:40,294 --> 02:36:43,661
Since we transmitted
your encephalogram,

1045
02:36:43,730 --> 02:36:47,188
none of the guests have come back.

1046
02:36:47,367 --> 02:36:51,428
Something incomprehensible is starting
to take place in the Ocean.

1047
02:36:51,572 --> 02:36:54,200
Islands have begun to form
on the surface.

1048
02:36:54,274 --> 02:36:58,210
First one. Then the next day
there were several more.

1049
02:36:58,278 --> 02:37:01,543
Are you trying to tell me
that it understood us?

1050
02:37:02,716 --> 02:37:04,616
That quickly?

1051
02:37:05,018 --> 02:37:09,387
But at least there's hope, eh, Kris?

1052
02:37:16,997 --> 02:37:20,592
- How old are you?
- Fifty-two. Why?

1053
02:37:21,668 --> 02:37:23,727
Have you been here long?

1054
02:37:24,938 --> 02:37:28,305
- You must have seen my forms.
- I did.

1055
02:37:29,509 --> 02:37:34,947
Listen, having spent so many years
here on the station,

1056
02:37:36,149 --> 02:37:40,848
do you still feel a clear connection
to your life down there?

1057
02:37:41,154 --> 02:37:43,987
You like dire questions.

1058
02:37:44,157 --> 02:37:47,524
Soon you'll ask me
about the meaning of life.

1059
02:37:47,594 --> 02:37:50,085
Wait. Don't be ironic.

1060
02:37:50,297 --> 02:37:52,561
It's a banal question.

1061
02:37:53,700 --> 02:37:56,066
When man is happy,

1062
02:37:56,270 --> 02:38:01,469
the meaning of life and other
eternal themes rarely interest him.

1063
02:38:02,843 --> 02:38:06,870
These questions should be asked
at the end of one's life.

1064
02:38:11,118 --> 02:38:15,145
But we don't know when life will end.

1065
02:38:15,222 --> 02:38:17,247
That's why we're in such a hurry.

1066
02:38:17,324 --> 02:38:19,189
Don't rush.

1067
02:38:19,259 --> 02:38:25,255
The happiest people are those who are
not interested in these cursed questions.

1068
02:38:25,365 --> 02:38:28,232
To ask is always
the desire to know.

1069
02:38:28,302 --> 02:38:32,568
Yet the preservation of
simple human truths requires mystery.

1070
02:38:32,806 --> 02:38:36,799
The mysteries of happiness,
death and love.

1071
02:38:36,944 --> 02:38:41,347
Maybe you're right,
but try not to think about all that now.

1072
02:38:42,182 --> 02:38:47,210
To think about it
is to know the day of one's death.

1073
02:38:49,022 --> 02:38:53,322
Not knowing that day
makes us practically immortal.

1074
02:38:58,865 --> 02:39:00,696
<i>Fine, then.</i>

1075
02:39:01,001 --> 02:39:03,799
<i>In any event,
my mission is finished.</i>

1076
02:39:03,971 --> 02:39:07,873
<i>But what next?
Return to Earth?</i>

1077
02:39:08,608 --> 02:39:10,872
<i>Little by little,
everything will return to normal.</i>

1078
02:39:10,944 --> 02:39:13,777
<i>I'll even find
new interests and acquaintances.</i>

1079
02:39:14,915 --> 02:39:17,884
<i>But I won't be able
to give myself to them fully.</i>

1080
02:39:18,585 --> 02:39:20,450
<i>Never.</i>

1081
02:39:22,823 --> 02:39:25,291
<i>Do I have the right to turn down</i>

1082
02:39:25,359 --> 02:39:30,456
<i>even an imagined possibility
of contact with this Ocean</i>

1083
02:39:30,964 --> 02:39:35,924
<i>which my race has been trying
to understand for decades?</i>

1084
02:39:36,670 --> 02:39:38,638
<i>Should I remain here?</i>

1085
02:39:38,905 --> 02:39:43,205
<i>Among things and objects
we both touched?</i>

1086
02:39:43,677 --> 02:39:46,271
<i>Which still bear the memory
of our breath?</i>

1087
02:39:46,446 --> 02:39:48,539
<i>What for?</i>

1088
02:39:48,615 --> 02:39:51,209
<i>In the hope that she'll return?</i>

1089
02:39:51,551 --> 02:39:54,577
<i>But I don't harbor this hope.</i>

1090
02:39:55,889 --> 02:39:57,948
<i>The only thing left for me</i>

1091
02:39:58,125 --> 02:40:00,821
<i>is to wait.</i>

1092
02:40:01,962 --> 02:40:05,864
<i>I don't know what for.
New miracles?</i>

1093
02:40:12,039 --> 02:40:13,802
Are you tired?

1094
02:40:14,241 --> 02:40:17,574
No, I feel great.

1095
02:40:17,677 --> 02:40:19,406
You know, Kris...

1096
02:40:19,546 --> 02:40:22,572
I think it's time
you returned to Earth.

1097
02:40:24,284 --> 02:40:26,377
You think so?

1098
02:46:45,598 --> 02:46:52,363
THE END
