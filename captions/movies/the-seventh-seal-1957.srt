3
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:18,553
<i>And when the Lamb
had opened the seventh seal...</i>

4
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:25,720
<i>there was silence in heaven
about the space of half an hour.</i>

5
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:32,397
<i>And the seven angels
who had the seven trumpets...</i>

6
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,986
<i>prepared themselves to sound.</i>

7
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,182
Who are you?

8
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,185
I am Death.

9
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,524
Have you come for me?

10
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,278
I've long been at your side.

11
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,105
Yes, I know.

12
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:43,944
Are you ready?

13
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,986
My flesh is afraid, but I am not.

14
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,419
Wait a moment.

15
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,799
You all say that.
But I grant no reprieves.

16
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,089
You play chess, do you not?

17
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,928
How did you know?

18
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,637
I've seen paintings
and heard ballads.

19
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:14,220
Yes, I am quite a skillful player.

20
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,473
You can't be better than me.

21
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,774
Why play chess with me?

22
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,689
That's my business.

23
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,403
You're quite right.

24
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:27,324
But as long as I hold out against you,
I get to live.

25
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,115
And if I win, you set me free.

26
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,832
You drew black.

27
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,878
Very appropriate,
don't you think?

28
00:06:55,498 --> 00:07:01,085
<i>Between a strumpet's legs to lie</i>

29
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:05,749
<i>That's the place for such as I</i>

30
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:16,843
<i>The Lord is up in heaven high
Far away off in the sky</i>

31
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,392
<i>While here below on every street</i>

32
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,106
<i>It's Brother Satan you will meet</i>

33
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,229
Everyone in FÃ¤rjestad spoke
of evil omens and other horrors.

34
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,735
They say two horses devoured
each other last night.

35
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,613
Graves opened wide,

36
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,112
and corpses lay scattered about.

37
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,742
Four suns hung in the sky
yesterday afternoon.

38
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,979
Can you tell me
the way to the inn?

39
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,297
Did he tell you the way?

40
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,008
Not exactly.

41
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,969
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

42
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,968
- Was he mute?
- No, sire.

43
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,809
As a matter of fact,
he was quite eloquent.

44
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,805
- I see.
- Most eloquent.

45
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,566
Though what he had to say
was quite gloomy.

46
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:22,366
Good morning.
Have you had your breakfast?

47
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:26,119
Pity I can't eat grass.

48
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,124
Can you teach me how?

49
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,832
We're a little hard up right now.

50
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:34,631
Folks in these parts
don't care much for juggling.

51
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,892
Mia, wake up!

52
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,182
I have to tell you what I saw!

53
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,691
Did something happen?

54
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,602
I had a vision.

55
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:40,607
No, it wasn't a vision.
It was quite real.

56
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,068
I see.
You had another vision.

57
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,989
I really did see her.

58
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:53,335
Whom did you see?

59
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,375
The Virgin Mary.

60
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,045
Did you really?

61
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,464
She was so close
I could have touched her.

62
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:05,385
She wore a golden crown
and a blue robe with golden flowers.

63
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,892
She was barefoot,
and in her little brown hands

64
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,513
she was holding the Child
and teaching him to walk.

65
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:16,809
She saw me watching her
and smiled at me.

66
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,520
My eyes filled with tears,

67
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,569
and when I wiped them away,
she was gone.

68
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,865
And there was
a great stillness everywhere,

69
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,115
in heaven and on earth.

70
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,533
You understand?

71
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,585
The things you imagine.

72
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,498
I see you don't believe me,
but it was real.

73
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,254
Not the reality you see.
A different kind.

74
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,424
Like when you said the devil
had painted our wagon wheels red,

75
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,593
using his tail for a brush.

76
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,103
Why must you always
bring that up?

77
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,016
Then we found
red paint under your nails.

78
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,267
Perhaps I did make that up,

79
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:02,734
but only so you'd believe
my other visions, the real ones.

80
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,777
Keep your visions in check...

81
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:08,240
or people will think
you're a half-wit, which you're not.

82
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:12,957
At least not yet, as far as I know.
Though I can't be sure.

83
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,083
I didn't ask to have visions.

84
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,453
It's not my fault
if voices speak to me,

85
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,622
the Virgin appears to me,

86
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,420
and angels and devils
like my company.

87
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:26,170
I told you once and for all:

88
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,472
I must have
my sleep in the morning!

89
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:32,385
I've begged and pleaded,
but nothing helps.

90
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,557
So now I'm telling you:

91
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,180
Shut up!

92
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,907
Mikael.

93
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,715
I want a better life for Mikael.

94
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,051
He's going to be a great acrobat.

95
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,712
Or perhaps a juggler

96
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,431
who can do
the one impossible trick.

97
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,175
What trick is that?

98
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,928
Making a ball
hang suspended in midair.

99
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:19,231
- That's impossible.
- For you and me.

100
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,100
But not for him.

101
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,527
You and your dreams.

102
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,945
I wrote a song

103
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:32,661
while I lay awake all last night.

104
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,743
Want to hear it?
- Yes, sing it.

105
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,867
I'm very curious.

106
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:41,746
<i>On a lily branch
a dove is perched</i>

107
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:45,166
<i>Against the Midsummer sky</i>

108
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:49,420
<i>He sings so sweetly
of Jesus Christ</i>

109
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:54,217
<i>And there's
great rejoicing on high</i>

110
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,104
Mia, are you asleep?

111
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,727
It was a lovely song.

112
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,350
I'm not done yet.

113
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:06,445
I heard,
but I'll just sleep a bit more.

114
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,564
Sing me the rest later.

115
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,907
All you do is sleep.

116
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,659
Is this any mask for an actor?
I ask you.

117
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,663
If the priests didn't pay so well,
I'd turn them down.

118
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,502
Going to play Death?

119
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,340
Scaring decent folk out of their wits
with this nonsense!

120
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,459
Where are we performing?

121
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:33,714
The saints' feast in Elsinore...
on the church steps, no less.

122
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,765
Why not something bawdy?
People prefer it, and it's more fun.

123
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,353
Idiot!

124
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,648
They say an evil pestilence
stalks the land.

125
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:48,146
The priests are speculating
in sudden death and moral bellyache.

126
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,772
What parts are we playing?

127
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,566
A fool like you can play
the soul of man.

128
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,409
Now that's a bad part.

129
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:58,372
Who decides here?
Who directs this troupe? I ask you.

130
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,702
"To this law, O fool,
there's no retort.

131
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:05,796
Your life hangs by a thread...

132
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,957
and your time is short."

133
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:15,798
Will the ladies fancy me
in this getup? I ask you.

134
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,812
- Jof?
- What is it?

135
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,573
Sit still and don't say a word.

136
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,735
I'm as silent as the grave.

137
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,158
I love you.

138
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,768
What's that supposed to be?

139
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,522
The dance of Death.

140
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:14,023
- That's Death there?
- Yes, he's dancing off with them.

141
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,025
Why paint such nonsense?

142
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,028
To remind people
they're going to die.

143
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,367
That won't cheer them up any.

144
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,375
Why always cheer them up,
damn it?

145
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,661
Why not scare them a bit?

146
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:30,631
- They won't look at your paintings.
- Oh, yes, they will.

147
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:34,251
A skull is more interesting
than a naked woman.

148
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,253
If you scare them...

149
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,262
- They'll think.
- And if they think...

150
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,925
- They'll get scared.
- And run into the arms of the priests.

151
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,929
- I can't help that.
- You just paint your pictures.

152
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,432
I paint things as they are.
People can do as they like.

153
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,560
Some will curse you.

154
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:54,150
Well, then I'll paint
something amusing.

155
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,486
A man's got to live.

156
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,242
At least till the plague gets him.

157
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,991
The plague? Sounds horrible.

158
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:06,746
You should see
the boils on the neck...

159
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,245
and how the body shrivels up

160
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:13,757
and the limbs flail around
like crazed ropes.

161
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,963
- Sounds nasty.
- Nasty indeed.

162
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:24,218
They try to tear the boils
right out of their flesh.

163
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,596
They bite their own hands,

164
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,480
scratch open their own veins,

165
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,609
and scream to high heaven.

166
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,104
Frightened?

167
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,277
Me? You don't know me.

168
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,030
What's that rubbish there?

169
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:44,826
Remarkably,
the poor wretches think

170
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:48,534
that the plague
is a punishment from God.

171
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:53,672
Crowds of "sinners" wander the land
whipping themselves and others

172
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,548
to please the Lord.

173
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,459
They whip themselves?

174
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,504
Yes. It's a horrible sight.

175
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:04,133
Best to hide in a ditch
until they pass.

176
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,562
Got any gin?
I've had nothing but water all day.

177
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:12,983
I'm as thirsty as a desert camel.

178
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,314
I think I frightened you after all.

179
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,718
I want to confess
as honestly as I can,

180
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,099
but my heart is empty.

181
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,349
And the emptiness is a mirror

182
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,726
turned toward my own face.

183
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:59,070
I see myself in it,

184
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,278
and it fills me
with loathing and horror.

185
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:13,244
My indifference to my fellow men
has cut me off from their company.

186
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,964
I live now in a world of phantoms,

187
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:20,584
a prisoner of my own dreams.

188
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:24,505
- Yet you don't want to die.
- Yes, I do.

189
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,557
What are you waiting for?

190
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,301
I want to know.

191
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,228
You want a guarantee.

192
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,481
Call it what you will.

193
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:44,279
Must it be so cruelly inconceivable
to know God through one's senses?

194
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:49,120
Why must he hide in a fog
of half-spoken promises

195
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,240
and unseen miracles?

196
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,747
How can we believe the believers
when we don't believe ourselves?

197
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:59,749
What will become of us
who want to believe but cannot?

198
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,256
And what of those
who neither will nor can believe?

199
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,421
Why can I not kill off
this God within me?

200
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:10,468
Why must he live on inside me
in this painful, humiliating way

201
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:14,096
when I want to tear him
out of my heart?

202
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,770
Why does he remain
a mocking reality

203
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,230
that I can't shake off?

204
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:23,105
You hear me?
- I hear you.

205
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,741
I want knowledge.

206
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:29,862
Not faith or conjecture,
but knowledge.

207
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,657
I want God to reach out his hand,

208
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,661
show his face, speak to me.

209
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:38,795
But he is silent.

210
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,165
I cry out to him in the darkness,

211
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,343
but sometimes it feels
like no one is there.

212
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,630
Perhaps no one <i>is</i> there.

213
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:50,178
Then life is just senseless horror.

214
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,052
No man can live facing death

215
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,679
knowing that everything
is nothingness.

216
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:58,899
Most people give no thought
to death or nothingness.

217
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:02,645
One day they'll stand on the far edge
of life, peering into the darkness.

218
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,147
Ah, that day.

219
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,404
I understand what you mean.

220
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:12,329
We carve an idol out of our fear

221
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,494
and call it God.

222
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,334
You're upset.

223
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,497
Death visited me this morning.

224
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:24,340
We're playing chess together.

225
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:29,513
This reprieve will enable me
to attend to an urgent matter.

226
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,256
What sort of matter?

227
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:36,770
My whole life has been nothing
but futile wandering and pursuits,

228
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,480
a great deal of talk
without meaning.

229
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,358
It's all been in vain.

230
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:46,230
I say that without bitterness
or self-reproach,

231
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:50,568
knowing that
most men's lives are the same.

232
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:57,704
But I want to use my reprieve
for one meaningful act.

233
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,713
So that's why you're playing
chess with Death.

234
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,378
He's a skillful strategist,

235
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,049
but I haven't lost a single piece yet.

236
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:14,057
How will you outwit him?

237
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:18,223
Through a combination
of bishop and knight...

238
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:21,348
that he has yet to catch on to.

239
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,399
Next I'll charge his flank.

240
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,903
I'll remember that.

241
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:35,703
You tricked me...

242
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,706
and cheated me.

243
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:42,036
But we will meet again...

244
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,871
and I'll find a way out.

245
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,544
We'll meet at the inn...

246
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,218
and continue our game there.

247
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,351
This is my hand.

248
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,346
I can move it.

249
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,975
Blood pulses through its veins.

250
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:09,480
The sun still stands
high in the sky,

251
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:11,489
and I...

252
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,651
Antonius Block...

253
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,288
am playing chess with Death.

254
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:25,625
My master and I
just returned from abroad.

255
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:29,170
Understand, my painter friend?

256
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:31,835
The crusades?

257
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,507
Precisely.

258
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:36,298
We spent ten years
in the Holy Land

259
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,888
letting snakes bite us,
insects sting us,

260
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,386
wild beasts maul us,
heathens attack us,

261
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:44,265
bad wine poison us,
women infect us,

262
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,858
lice eat us,
and fever consume us...

263
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:50,229
all for the glory of God.

264
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:52,230
For the glory of God.

265
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:57,027
Our crusade was so stupid

266
00:24:57,287 --> 00:25:00,746
that only a true idealist
could have thought it up.

267
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,417
What you said
about the plague was horrible.

268
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:10,506
It's worse than that.

269
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:16,464
Well, wherever you turn,
your rump's always behind you.

270
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,298
There's a great truth.

271
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:22,724
Your rump's always behind you.

272
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,434
A profound truth.

273
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,108
Here you see squire JÃ¶ns.

274
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,943
He grins at Death,
scoffs at the Lord,

275
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,529
laughs at himself,
and smiles at the girls.

276
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:37,909
He lives in a JÃ¶ns-world
believable only to himself,

277
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,745
ridiculous to all,
including himself,

278
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:45,371
meaningless to heaven,
and of no interest to hell.

279
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,483
Your soup stinks like hell.
What's it for?

280
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:18,238
She had carnal intercourse
with the Evil One.

281
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,909
And now she's in the stocks.

282
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,950
She's to be burned tomorrow,
and we must ward off the devil.

283
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,083
With that stinking muck?

284
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:30,415
It's the best remedy:

285
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:34,006
blood mixed with the bile
of a big black dog.

286
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,544
The Evil One can't stand the smell.

287
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,838
Neither can I.

288
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,599
Have you seen the devil?

289
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,270
- You mustn't speak to her.
- Is it that dangerous?

290
00:26:55,697 --> 00:27:00,613
I don't know, but she's thought
to be the cause of this plague.

291
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,608
<i>Fate's a roguish villain</i>

292
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,730
<i>Poor friend, you're at his call</i>

293
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,698
<i>First you leap and bound</i>

294
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,864
<i>Then like a worm you crawl</i>

295
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,079
Must you sing?

296
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,698
No.

297
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,540
Why look so surprised?
I steal from the dead.

298
00:29:57,713 --> 00:30:00,205
A lucrative business nowadays.

299
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:07,299
No use running off
to tell the others.

300
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:11,300
Every man saves his own skin.

301
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:13,301
It's as simple as that.

302
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,304
Don't try to scream.

303
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:19,308
There's no one to hear you,
neither God nor man.

304
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,476
Nothing to be surprised about.

305
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:30,990
I know you,
but it's been a long time.

306
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:34,497
You're Raval,
from the seminary in Roskilde.

307
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:38,331
<i>Doctor mirabilis,
cÅlestis et diabilis.</i>

308
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:40,836
Am I not right?

309
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:45,758
Ten years ago
you convinced my master

310
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,928
to join a noble crusade
to the Holy Land.

311
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,725
You look uneasy.
Stomach bothering you?

312
00:30:56,688 --> 00:31:01,353
I suddenly understand the meaning
of those ten wasted years.

313
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:04,690
We were too well-off,
too satisfied with ourselves.

314
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,276
The Lord sought
to chasten our smug pride.

315
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,691
So he sent you

316
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:14,200
to spew your holy venom
and poison my master's mind.

317
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:15,867
I acted in good faith.

318
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:19,792
Now you know better, huh?
You've turned thief.

319
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:25,040
A more suitable and rewarding
occupation for scoundrels.

320
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,083
Isn't that so?

321
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:34,261
Oh, I'm not a bloodthirsty man.

322
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,642
But next time we meet,

323
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:41,060
I'll mark up your face like they do
with petty scoundrels of your kind.

324
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:45,060
I just stopped in
to fill my waterskin.

325
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,532
JÃ¶ns is the name.

326
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:58,247
A pleasant, talkative young man

327
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:03,583
who thinks only kind thoughts
and performs only noble deeds.

328
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,426
Farewell, my lass.

329
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,970
I could have raped you,

330
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,595
but I've tired of that kind of love.

331
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,181
It gets a little dry in the end.

332
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:26,313
Come to think of it,
I'll need a housekeeper.

333
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,311
Are you a good cook?

334
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,570
I'm a married man, but with any luck
my wife is dead by now,

335
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:36,114
so I'll be needing a housekeeper.

336
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,199
Don't stand there gaping,
damn it!

337
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:44,623
I saved your life!
You owe me a great deal!

338
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,720
Damn jugglers!

339
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,808
They're making fools
of themselves.

340
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:27,972
Stop that,
you tin-headed swine!

341
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,818
I'm not in the first part,
so I'm going behind the curtain.

342
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,819
Don't stand there gaping,
you blockheads!

343
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,744
<i>The horse sits in the tree
and crows</i>

344
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:48,580
<i>Wide is the path
but narrow is the gate</i>

345
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:52,251
<i>The Black One
dances on the shore</i>

346
00:34:55,343 --> 00:35:00,463
<i>The hen mews in a lake so dark</i>

347
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:10,394
<i>The day is red
but the fish is dead</i>

348
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:14,319
<i>The Black One
crouches on the shore</i>

349
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:21,613
<i>The serpent flutters
high in the sky</i>

350
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:28,207
<i>The Virgin is pale
but the mouse is content</i>

351
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:31,828
<i>The Black One
runs on the shore</i>

352
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:37,466
<i>The ram hisses</i>

353
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:41,133
<i>Through his two teeth</i>

354
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,969
<i>The gust is strong</i>

355
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:51,806
<i>And the waves crash</i>

356
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:56,653
<i>The Black One
makes dung on the shore</i>

357
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:59,879
<i>The sow lays eggs
and the cat sows</i>

358
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:06,343
<i>The night is like soot
and the dark remains</i>

359
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:10,893
<i>The Black One stays and stays</i>

360
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:14,555
<i>And stays on the shore</i>

361
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:37,285
God has sent his punishment
down upon us.

362
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:45,707
You shall all perish
from the Black Death.

363
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:51,883
You there, gaping like cattle,

364
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:56,221
and you sitting there
in your glutted complacency,

365
00:39:56,394 --> 00:40:00,559
don't you know that this
could be your final hour?

366
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,894
Death stands at your back.

367
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:11,448
I see the crown of his head
gleaming in the sun.

368
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:15,988
His scythe flashes
above your heads.

369
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,331
Which of you
will he strike down first?

370
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,787
You there, staring like a goat...

371
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,961
will nightfall see your mouth

372
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,502
twisted into
its last unfinished gasp?

373
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,549
You, woman...

374
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:38,392
blooming with lust
for life and pleasure...

375
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:44,436
will you grow pale
and wither before the dawn?

376
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,942
You there...

377
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:52,447
with your bulbous nose
and idiotic grin...

378
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:57,908
do you have another year
to defile the earth with your refuse?

379
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:03,664
Don't you obstinate fools know
you're going to die?

380
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:07,956
Today, tomorrow, the next day...
you're all doomed.

381
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:11,129
You hear me?

382
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,217
Doomed!

383
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:19,683
Lord, have mercy on us
in our humiliation.

384
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:22,428
Turn thy face not away
in loathing and contempt,

385
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,976
but be merciful to us

386
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:28,150
for the sake of thy son,
Jesus Christ!

387
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:34,299
All that damned ranting
about doom.

388
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:37,052
Is that sustenance
for modern people?

389
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:40,055
Do they really expect us
to take it seriously?

390
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,341
You laugh at me, sire.

391
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:45,765
But I've read or heard
or lived through

392
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:48,605
all the tales men tell each other.

393
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,527
Even the ghost stories
about God the Father,

394
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,816
Jesus Christ,
and the Holy Ghost...

395
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:58,406
I took them all in
without batting an eye.

396
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,530
What are you shouting about?

397
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:04,621
I'm Plog, the smith,
and you're JÃ¶ns, the squire.

398
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:07,729
- That may be.
- Have you seen my wife?

399
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:10,457
No, but if she looks like you,

400
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,706
I'd do my best to forget I had.

401
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:18,381
Then you haven't seen her?

402
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,259
- Maybe she's run off.
- You know something?

403
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,098
Quite a lot.
But not about your wife.

404
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:27,015
Maybe they can help you
in the tavern.

405
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:50,784
It's true. The plague
is spreading along the west coast.

406
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:53,045
People are dying like flies.

407
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,835
Business should be good
this time of year,

408
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:58,630
but I haven't sold a damn thing!

409
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,803
They speak of Judgment Day,

410
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:05,470
and there's all the evil omens.

411
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:10,186
They say a woman gave birth
to a calf's head.

412
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:14,308
People are crazed.
They flee and take the plague with them.

413
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,944
If all that's true,
then we should enjoy life

414
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:20,485
as long as we're still standing.

415
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:24,360
Many have died
trying to purge themselves in fire,

416
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:30,161
but better to die pure
than live for hell, the priests say.

417
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,791
This is the end...

418
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:33,790
that's what it is.

419
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:38,165
No one dares say it aloud,
but this is the end.

420
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,504
People are crazed with fear.

421
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:44,346
- You're scared yourself.
- I'm scared as hell!

422
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,843
Judgment Day
becomes Judgment Night,

423
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,764
when the angels descend
and graves open.

424
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:55,516
It will be a terrible sight.

425
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:02,322
Want this bracelet?
You can have it cheap.

426
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:05,033
- I can't afford it.
- It's genuine silver.

427
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:07,824
It's nice,
but I'm sure it's too expensive.

428
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:11,323
Excuse me,
but have any of you seen my wife?

429
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:14,042
- Is she missing?
- They say she's run off.

430
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:16,503
- Run off?
- With an actor.

431
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:20,211
An actor?
If her taste is that bad, let her go.

432
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:22,005
You're right.

433
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:25,300
My first thought, of course,
was to murder her.

434
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:28,139
Murder?
That's a different story.

435
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,634
And the actor with her.

436
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:32,428
The actor?

437
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,897
- Yes, the one she ran off with.
- Whatever for?

438
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,684
Are you dense, or what?

439
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:41,941
Oh, the actor!
Now I understand.

440
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:44,315
Yes, there are
far too many of them.

441
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:48,410
Guilty or not, you should kill him
just for being an actor.

442
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:52,244
Listen, you.
You're lying to the smith.

443
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,578
Me? Lying?

444
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:01,169
You're an actor too.

445
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,338
A friend of yours probably
ran off with his old lady.

446
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,713
Are you an actor too?

447
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:11,425
Me, an actor?
I'd hardly call myself that.

448
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:14,724
We should kill you too.
It's only logical.

449
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:17,973
You're very funny.

450
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:21,273
You've turned pale.
Guilty conscience?

451
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,902
You're funny.

452
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:26,194
Don't you think he's funny?
I see you don't.

453
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:30,027
Perhaps we should
mark up your face

454
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:33,200
like they do
with petty scoundrels of your kind.

455
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:35,950
What have you done
with my wife?

456
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:53,592
You mean to hurt me? Why?

457
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:57,138
Have I offended anyone
or got in the way?

458
00:46:57,273 --> 00:47:00,641
I'll leave right now
and never come back.

459
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:03,477
Stand up
so everyone can hear you.

460
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:09,066
Speak louder.

461
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:14,700
Show us your acting skills:
Stand on your head.

462
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:28,502
What have you done
with my wife?

463
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:33,174
Get up and dance!

464
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:35,096
No, I can't.

465
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:38,015
- Imitate a bear.
- I can't imitate a bear.

466
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:39,763
We'll see about that.

467
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:41,409
Get up! Be a good bear.

468
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,373
I can't be a bear anymore.

469
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:05,270
Remember what I said I'd do
if we met again?

470
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:09,019
I always keep my word!

471
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:35,220
What's his name?

472
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:37,089
Mikael.

473
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,934
- How old is he?
- Over a year now.

474
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:44,725
- He's big for his age.
- You think so?

475
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,432
Yes, I guess he is.

476
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:50,985
You were
in that performance earlier.

477
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:52,695
Was it awful?

478
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:55,406
You're prettier
without that paint on your face,

479
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:57,568
and this dress suits you better.

480
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,365
You think so?

481
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:03,832
Jonas Skat ran off and left us,
so we're in a real fix now.

482
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,243
- Is that your husband?
- Jonas?

483
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:10,463
No. The other one's my husband.
His name is Jof.

484
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:12,253
Oh, him.

485
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:14,676
Now it's just the two of us.

486
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:18,009
We'll have to do
those confounded tricks again.

487
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:20,174
- You do tricks too?
- Oh, yes.

488
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:22,851
And Jof is a good juggler.

489
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:25,179
Will Mikael be an acrobat too?

490
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:28,231
- Jof wants him to be.
- But you don't?

491
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:31,735
I don't know.
Perhaps he'll become a knight.

492
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,275
That's not much fun either.

493
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:37,190
- No, you don't look happy.
- No.

494
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,860
Are you weary?

495
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,573
Why?

496
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,321
I'm in dull company.

497
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,541
- You mean your squire?
- No, not him.

498
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,372
Who then?

499
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:50,166
Myself.

500
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,542
I understand.

501
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,715
Do you really?

502
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,468
Yes, I understand quite well.

503
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:03,054
I've often wondered
why people torment themselves so.

504
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,391
Mia.

505
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,514
Jof! What is it?

506
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:13,352
Jof, where have you been?

507
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:17,989
Come sit down.
Where have you been?

508
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,070
Let me see.

509
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:29,497
Why'd you go to that tavern?
You drank there, of course.

510
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:33,295
I didn't drink a drop!

511
00:51:33,966 --> 00:51:37,084
I suppose you sat boasting
about your angels and devils.

512
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:39,802
People don't look kindly
on those kinds of tales.

513
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,092
I never said
a damned word about angels!

514
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:44,849
Then you were singing
and dancing again.

515
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:49,096
You're always performing.
People don't like that either.

516
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:53,396
Look what I bought for you.

517
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:00,319
You couldn't afford this.

518
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:02,443
I bought it anyway.

519
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:09,082
Oh, how they beat me!

520
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:11,576
Why didn't you hit them back?

521
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:13,874
I just get frightened and angry.

522
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:16,293
I never get a chance
to hit back.

523
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:18,417
But boy, did I get angry!

524
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,794
I roared like a lion.

525
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:22,512
Were they scared?

526
00:52:22,765 --> 00:52:24,882
No, they just laughed.

527
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,611
Doesn't he smell nice?

528
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:45,486
He's so solid.
You're a sturdy one.

529
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:47,613
A real little acrobat.

530
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,662
This is my husband, Jof.

531
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:56,204
Good evening.

532
00:52:57,007 --> 00:53:00,500
You have a fine son there.
He'll bring you much joy.

533
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:02,510
Yes, he's a fine boy.

534
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:06,677
Have we nothing to offer our guest?
- Nothing for me, thank you.

535
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,388
I picked wild strawberries
this afternoon.

536
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:14,311
And there's milk fresh from the cow.
- That we had permission to take.

537
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:17,559
We'd be honored
if you'd share our humble meal.

538
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:20,312
Sit down and I'll bring it.

539
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:22,735
Please.

540
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:26,360
- Where are you headed now?
- The saints' feast in Elsinore.

541
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:28,529
I'd advise against that.

542
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:30,368
Why, if I may ask?

543
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:33,249
The plague has spread
along the southern coast.

544
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:35,619
Tens of thousands are dying.

545
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:38,872
Ah, there's no end
to trouble in life, is there?

546
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:43,259
Come with me through the forest.
You can stay at my castle

547
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:46,050
or follow the eastern coast.
It'll be safer.

548
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:49,842
These strawberries were growing
up on the hillside.

549
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:52,094
I've never seen any so big.

550
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:54,391
Just smell!

551
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,065
I wish you a hearty appetite.

552
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,147
My humble thanks.

553
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:04,693
Your offer is attractive,
but I must think about it.

554
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:08,114
It would be nice to have
company through the forest.

555
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:12,114
I've heard it's full of trolls
and ghosts and bandits.

556
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:16,000
It's not a bad idea,
but I must think it over.

557
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:19,041
With Skat gone,
I'm in charge now.

558
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:22,882
I'm director
of the entire company now.

559
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:26,799
"I'm director
of the entire company now."

560
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,641
Some strawberries?

561
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:34,978
That man saved my life.

562
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,097
Come join us, my friend.

563
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:39,440
JÃ¶ns the squire
offers his thanks.

564
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:44,062
Oh, how lovely this is.

565
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:46,690
- For a little while.
- Almost always.

566
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:49,951
One day is like another.

567
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:52,241
Nothing strange about that.

568
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:56,955
Summer is better than winter,
of course, because you aren't freezing.

569
00:54:57,503 --> 00:54:59,495
But spring is best of all.

570
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:03,089
I wrote a song about spring.
I'll get my lyre...

571
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:04,799
Not now, Jof.

572
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:07,631
Our guests may not care
for your songs.

573
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:10,801
- By all means. I write songs myself.
- You see?

574
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:15,059
I have one about a randy fish
I bet you've never heard.

575
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:18,187
And I guess you're not going to.

576
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:21,642
Some don't appreciate my art,
and I wouldn't impose,

577
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:23,484
sensitive soul that I am.

578
00:55:27,783 --> 00:55:29,866
People have
such troubles these days.

579
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:33,786
It's always better being a couple.
Do you have no one?

580
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:36,247
- I had once.
- Where is she now?

581
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:38,165
I don't know.

582
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:42,121
You look so solemn!
Was she your beloved?

583
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,422
We were newly married.

584
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:47,293
We played and laughed endlessly.

585
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:51,092
I wrote songs
to her eyes, her nose,

586
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,635
her beautiful little ears.

587
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,388
We hunted together.

588
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:59,809
At night we danced,
and the house was full of life.

589
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,182
How about some strawberries?

590
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:06,443
Faith is a heavy burden,
you know?

591
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:09,732
It's like loving someone
out in the darkness

592
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:12,905
who never comes,
no matter how loud you call.

593
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:17,868
How unreal all that seems now

594
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,538
sitting here with you
and your husband.

595
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:24,041
How insignificant all of a sudden.

596
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,297
Now you don't look so solemn.

597
00:56:29,428 --> 00:56:31,545
I will remember this moment.

598
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:33,967
The stillness, the dusk...

599
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:38,514
these wild strawberries,
this bowl of milk...

600
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:43,056
your faces in the evening light.

601
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:45,646
Mikael asleep...

602
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:48,145
Jof with his lyre.

603
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:51,902
I'll try to remember
what we spoke of...

604
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:56,569
and I'll hold that memory
in my hands

605
00:56:57,039 --> 00:57:01,704
like a bowl full to the brim
with fresh milk.

606
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:10,250
And it will be a sign for me...

607
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:14,008
and a source
of great satisfaction.

608
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,630
I've been waiting.

609
00:57:51,927 --> 00:57:55,011
Forgive me. I was detained.

610
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:58,798
Since I gave away my strategy,
I beat a retreat.

611
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:02,719
Please. It's your turn.

612
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:06,439
- What are you so happy about?
- That's my secret.

613
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:08,308
Of course.

614
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:13,321
I take your knight.
- As you were meant to.

615
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:17,446
- Did you trick me?
- Of course!

616
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:21,704
You fell right into my trap.
Check.

617
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,787
Why do you laugh?

618
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:27,831
Never mind my laughter.
Just save your king.

619
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:30,375
You're very sure of yourself.

620
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,590
Our game amuses me.

621
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:37,220
Your move.
And be quick. I'm in a hurry.

622
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,680
I know you have much to do,

623
00:58:41,143 --> 00:58:43,351
but our game must proceed
at its own pace.

624
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:46,721
Will you be escorting
those jesters through the forest?

625
00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:51,526
The ones called Jof and Mia,
who have a little son?

626
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,860
Why do you ask?

627
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:00,534
No reason.

628
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:12,205
Have you seen JÃ¶ns?
We must be going.

629
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,999
I think he's in the tavern.

630
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:22,090
God in heaven!
If it isn't Plog the smith!

631
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:26,431
Are you blubbering here
all by yourself?

632
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,429
Look at the smith,

633
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:31,433
moaning like a rabbit
drowning in piss.

634
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:34,561
- Your wife again?
- Yes, I have yet to find her.

635
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:37,651
It's hell with women
and hell without them.

636
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:41,401
Best to kill 'em
while you're still having fun.

637
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:44,116
Nagging and pig swill.

638
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,079
Screaming babies
and stinking diapers.

639
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:48,370
Sharp nails and sharp words.

640
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:51,290
The devil's own aunt
for a mother-in-law.

641
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,913
And when you climb into bed
to get some sleep...

642
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:55,798
Then it's a different tune.

643
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:59,294
Sobbing and moaning
to wake the dead.

644
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:03,013
- "Why don't you kiss me good night?"
- "Why don't you sing me a song?"

645
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:05,508
"Why don't you love me
like before?"

646
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:07,852
"You didn't notice my new dress."

647
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:10,604
"All you do
is turn over and snore."

648
01:00:10,816 --> 01:00:13,149
- Damn it all!
- Damn it all?

649
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:15,940
She's gone now. Rejoice!

650
01:00:19,074 --> 01:00:22,442
I'll twist their noses off with pliers

651
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:26,537
and bash their chests in
with a hammer.

652
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:31,459
I'll give them a nice little tap
on the head with a sledgehammer.

653
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:34,788
There he goes blubbering again.

654
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:37,920
Maybe I love her.

655
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:39,963
Maybe you love her?

656
01:00:40,095 --> 01:00:42,678
Listen,
you big misguided ham shank:

657
01:00:42,806 --> 01:00:46,140
Love is nothing but lust,
lust, and more lust,

658
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:50,394
with a lot of cheating, lies,
and general tomfoolery thrown in.

659
01:00:50,689 --> 01:00:53,727
- It hurts all the same.
- Of course it does.

660
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:56,518
Love is the blackest
of all plagues,

661
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:59,270
and the only pleasure
would be to die of it.

662
01:00:59,406 --> 01:01:01,238
But it almost always passes.

663
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:03,449
No, mine won't.

664
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:05,569
Yes, yours will too.

665
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:09,330
Only a few wretched fools
die of love.

666
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:14,035
If everything is imperfect
in this imperfect world,

667
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:19,462
love is most perfect
in its perfect imperfection.

668
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:23,545
You're lucky,
with that oiled jaw of yours.

669
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,138
You believe your own twaddle.

670
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:28,508
Who says I believe it?

671
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:31,678
But ask for a word of advice
and I'll give you two.

672
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:34,017
I'm a man of learning, after all.

673
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:38,651
JÃ¶ns, could I go with you
through the forest?

674
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:40,735
I'm so lonely...

675
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:44,028
and they'll just laugh
at me at home.

676
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:48,285
Just don't blubber all the time,
or we'll leave you behind.

677
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:02,708
Little brother!

678
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:06,754
Watch out, JÃ¶ns!
That one's a fighter, and off his rocker.

679
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:08,927
Right now he's a sniveler.

680
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:10,971
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

681
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:14,015
I have such
a confounded temper.

682
01:02:14,189 --> 01:02:15,805
Shake hands.

683
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:21,359
Give me a hug, little brother.

684
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:23,480
Thanks. Maybe later.

685
01:02:23,615 --> 01:02:27,074
We're in a hurry at the moment.
But thanks.

686
01:03:17,544 --> 01:03:18,580
Look!

687
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:21,204
- What's this I see?
- You see something?

688
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:24,082
Who's that I spy
at the forest's edge

689
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:28,173
if not my own dearly beloved
with actor in tow!

690
01:03:51,036 --> 01:03:52,322
Watch out!

691
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:56,915
It's the filthy smith
who insulted my beloved lady,

692
01:03:57,042 --> 01:03:59,159
the fair Kunigunda.

693
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:00,827
What did you call her?

694
01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:03,504
Kunigunda.
Are you deaf now too?

695
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:08,342
Her name is Lisa.
Strumpet Lisa.

696
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:12,513
Rumpy, smutty, slutty Lisa.

697
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:14,010
He's so vulgar!

698
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:17,685
Or think of another word
yourself for "tramp"...

699
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:19,678
you gilded shithead!

700
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:21,350
Vulgar brute!

701
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:24,601
You stubble-headed bastard
of seven mangy mongrels,

702
01:04:24,736 --> 01:04:27,274
if I were in your lice-infested rags,

703
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:31,111
I'd feel such boundless shame
about my own person

704
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:35,532
that I would immediately rid nature
of my own mortifying countenance.

705
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:38,031
Be careful, you perfumed...

706
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:40,081
Dung heap.

707
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:42,868
Dung heap.

708
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:45,872
Or else...

709
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:49,546
I'll blow you down to actors' hell
with one great fart...

710
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:52,340
where you can sit and...

711
01:04:52,514 --> 01:04:54,255
Recite monologues.

712
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:58,510
Recite monologues to each other
till dust runs out the devil's ears!

713
01:04:58,645 --> 01:04:59,726
Bravo!

714
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:04,683
And I'll prod you in the belly so hard
your guts will run out your ears.

715
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:07,897
And I'll punch you so hard

716
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:11,940
that you'll never again perform
your tricks for Turks and cannibals.

717
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:15,906
Why are you laughing?
This is serious.

718
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:20,449
In southern lands there are
human-like animals called apes.

719
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:23,705
- What of it?
- Just mentioning it.

720
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:25,911
My dear little Plog.

721
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:27,413
What?

722
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:32,467
Darling Plog,
forgive me for everything.

723
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:34,678
She'll start crying any minute.

724
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:38,140
I have to cry.
It's just too dreadful.

725
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:42,262
You can't imagine
how horribly that man deceived me.

726
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,564
Look here, Kunigunda.
Truth be told...

727
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:48,526
Next it'll be his favorite dish.

728
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:51,233
Plog, when we get home,

729
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:55,108
I'll fix you pork dumplings
with rutabagas and lingonberries.

730
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:59,325
That's your favorite,
isn't it, my dear little Plog?

731
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:03,166
Yes, but first I have to kill him.

732
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:07,082
Yes, do that.
Kill him good and proper.

733
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:10,331
I can't stand him anymore.

734
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:13,050
Good Lord,
why did you give us woman?

735
01:06:13,178 --> 01:06:16,342
He's nothing
but a false beard, false teeth,

736
01:06:16,598 --> 01:06:20,308
false smiles, and rehearsed lines,
empty as a jug.

737
01:06:20,727 --> 01:06:22,468
Just kill him!

738
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:25,304
Dear Plog...

739
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:29,692
if you thought I'd try to justify
my so-called reality, you were wrong.

740
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:34,322
Kill me. I'll thank you afterward.
- What's that?

741
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:38,492
The actor sows emotional confusion...
that's half the battle.

742
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:40,486
Don't just stand there gaping.

743
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:43,952
He has to put up a fight,
or I can't kill him.

744
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:46,621
He has to at least provoke me.

745
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:51,334
My friends, I will plunge
this dagger into my breast...

746
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:56,802
and my unreality will soon be
transformed into a new, solid reality:

747
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:59,673
an absolutely tangible corpse.

748
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:03,509
Hold on a minute.
I didn't mean any harm.

749
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:05,848
I forgive you, Kunigunda.

750
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:07,767
Farewell, my friend.

751
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:09,731
Pray for me sometime.

752
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:28,659
Oh, dear!

753
01:07:29,212 --> 01:07:31,374
I didn't mean it like that.

754
01:07:31,506 --> 01:07:33,498
I was beginning to like him.

755
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:35,257
He's dead.

756
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:38,298
Totally, enormously dead.
The deadest actor I've ever seen.

757
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:42,924
This is all terribly sad,
but it's his own fault, poor thing.

758
01:07:43,101 --> 01:07:45,388
And this is what I'm married to!

759
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:48,305
Now you have
your little Lisa back.

760
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:51,143
Happy now?

761
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:53,517
JÃ¶ns...

762
01:07:53,653 --> 01:07:56,942
just between you and me,
isn't life...

763
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:58,860
Yes, it is.

764
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:01,241
But don't think about that now.

765
01:08:02,245 --> 01:08:04,828
It's crazy, that's what it is.

766
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:15,004
I played that scene well.

767
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,792
I'm quite the actor.

768
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:24,089
Now to find a tree
I can climb up...

769
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:28,974
so no bears, wolves,
or ghosts can get me.

770
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:52,460
Tomorrow I'll look for Jof and Mia,

771
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:55,538
and off we'll go to Elsinore.

772
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:59,337
I'll sing myself a little song.

773
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:03,258
<i>I am a little bird
who sings whate'er he will</i>

774
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:07,800
Workmen in the forest.

775
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:17,609
They're cutting down my tree!

776
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:22,485
Hey, you pupated pecker,
what are you doing to my tree?

777
01:09:22,784 --> 01:09:24,525
Can't you at least answer?

778
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:27,153
Courtesy costs nothing.
Who are you?

779
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:32,283
I'm cutting down your tree
because your time is up.

780
01:09:33,378 --> 01:09:35,165
You can't. I don't have time!

781
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:37,413
You don't say.

782
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:40,794
I have a performance!

783
01:09:40,927 --> 01:09:43,544
Canceled on account of death.

784
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,171
But my contract!

785
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:46,513
Terminated.

786
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:50,597
My family, my children...

787
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:52,932
Skat, you should be ashamed!

788
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:56,182
Yes, I am ashamed.

789
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:01,896
Are there no reprieves
or exemptions for actors?

790
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:04,899
No, not in this case.

791
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:07,234
No loopholes?

792
01:10:07,495 --> 01:10:08,986
No exceptions?

793
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:56,583
The moon's come out
from behind the clouds.

794
01:10:58,004 --> 01:11:01,247
Good.
Now we'll see the road better.

795
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:03,799
I don't like the moon tonight.

796
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:06,259
The trees are so still.

797
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:08,594
Because there's no breeze.

798
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:13,267
He means they're unusually still.

799
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:16,387
It's completely quiet.

800
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,729
- If only we could hear a fox.
- Or an owl.

801
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:23,022
Or a human voice...

802
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,192
besides our own.

803
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:56,343
Where are you going?

804
01:11:56,771 --> 01:11:59,764
- The execution grounds.
- Ah, yes, the witch.

805
01:12:00,608 --> 01:12:04,227
Why burn her at night
when people need diversion?

806
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:07,400
Shut up, by all the dev...
by all the saints.

807
01:12:07,532 --> 01:12:09,694
The devil is with her.

808
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:12,318
Then you're eight brave men.

809
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:16,413
We've been paid.
This is a volunteer job.

810
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:56,092
Can you hear me?

811
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:01,685
They say you've been
in league with the devil.

812
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:03,474
Why do you ask?

813
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:07,600
Not out of idle curiosity,
but for very personal reasons.

814
01:14:09,028 --> 01:14:10,815
I too want to meet him.

815
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:13,230
Why?

816
01:14:14,492 --> 01:14:16,609
I want to ask him about God.

817
01:14:17,495 --> 01:14:19,327
He must know...

818
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:21,576
or no one does.

819
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:25,242
You can see him
anytime you wish.

820
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:27,039
How?

821
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:29,583
You must do as I say.

822
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:33,963
Look into my eyes.

823
01:14:37,014 --> 01:14:41,054
Well, what do you see?
Do you see him?

824
01:14:41,394 --> 01:14:46,310
I see dumb terror in your eyes.

825
01:14:46,857 --> 01:14:48,519
Nothing else.

826
01:14:50,194 --> 01:14:54,359
No one? Nothing?

827
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:57,156
No.

828
01:14:58,786 --> 01:15:00,823
Isn't that him behind you?

829
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:05,244
No.

830
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:07,830
There's no one there.

831
01:15:11,132 --> 01:15:13,124
He's with me everywhere.

832
01:15:13,384 --> 01:15:17,173
I need only reach out my hand
and I feel his.

833
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:19,470
He's with me even now.

834
01:15:20,099 --> 01:15:21,715
The fire won't hurt me.

835
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:23,808
- Did he say that?
- I know.

836
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:27,145
- Did he say that?
- I know!

837
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:29,932
You must see him too.

838
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:34,103
The priests could see him,
and the soldiers too.

839
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:37,273
They're so afraid of him
that they dare not touch me.

840
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:45,622
Why did you crush her hands?

841
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:47,912
- It wasn't us.
- Who, then?

842
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:50,122
Ask the monk over there.

843
01:15:52,423 --> 01:15:54,380
What did you do to that girl?

844
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:01,714
Do you never stop asking questions?

845
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:04,386
No.

846
01:16:05,436 --> 01:16:07,223
Never.

847
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:09,729
Yet you get no answers.

848
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:29,957
I thought we might kill
all the soldiers,

849
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:32,627
but she's nearly dead already.

850
01:16:32,755 --> 01:16:35,919
I told you to be careful!
Don't go near her!

851
01:16:46,894 --> 01:16:48,476
Take this.

852
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:50,436
It will stop the pain.

853
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:53,909
What does she see?
Can you answer that?

854
01:17:54,044 --> 01:17:57,503
- She feels no pain now.
- You didn't answer my question.

855
01:17:57,756 --> 01:17:59,873
Who's watching over that child?

856
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:02,592
The angels? God? Satan?

857
01:18:03,012 --> 01:18:04,719
Or just emptiness?

858
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:07,843
Emptiness, sire.
- That can't be!

859
01:18:08,475 --> 01:18:09,841
Look in her eyes.

860
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:13,478
Her poor brain's
just made a discovery:

861
01:18:13,772 --> 01:18:15,604
emptiness in the moonlight.

862
01:18:15,774 --> 01:18:16,890
No!

863
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:20,353
We stand by helpless,
arms hanging at our sides,

864
01:18:20,487 --> 01:18:24,322
for we see what she sees,
and her terror is ours.

865
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:26,949
Poor child.

866
01:18:27,995 --> 01:18:29,861
I can't stand it!

867
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:50,818
<i>He sings so sweetly
of Jesus Christ</i>

868
01:19:51,078 --> 01:19:56,619
<i>And there's
great rejoicing on high</i>

869
01:19:57,626 --> 01:19:59,618
It will soon be dawn...

870
01:20:00,296 --> 01:20:03,460
but the heat hangs in the air
like a damp blanket.

871
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:05,961
I'm so afraid!

872
01:20:06,969 --> 01:20:09,507
We know something's going
to happen to us,

873
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:11,379
but we don't know what.

874
01:20:12,599 --> 01:20:14,306
Judgment Day, perhaps.

875
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:16,138
Judgment Day.

876
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:29,273
<i>Give me some water!</i>

877
01:20:32,703 --> 01:20:34,695
I have the plague!

878
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,822
Don't come past that stump.

879
01:20:42,755 --> 01:20:44,872
I'm afraid of dying!

880
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:47,712
I don't want to die!

881
01:20:53,807 --> 01:20:56,094
Won't you have pity on me?

882
01:20:56,352 --> 01:20:57,809
Help me.

883
01:20:58,937 --> 01:21:01,475
At least talk to me!

884
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:08,903
It's no use.

885
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:11,363
Absolutely no use.

886
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:14,276
I'm sure of that.

887
01:21:18,415 --> 01:21:22,284
I'm dying. I'm...

888
01:21:26,048 --> 01:21:28,210
What will happen to me?

889
01:21:29,218 --> 01:21:31,335
Will no one console me?

890
01:21:31,929 --> 01:21:34,467
Have you no compassion?

891
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:37,052
Can't you see that I'm...

892
01:21:38,185 --> 01:21:41,474
Will no one help me?
Just a little water.

893
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:44,063
It's pointless.

894
01:21:44,358 --> 01:21:46,566
Utterly pointless.

895
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:50,229
I tell you, it's pointless.

896
01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:52,275
Help me!

897
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:54,900
Don't you see
I'm trying to console you?

898
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:23,936
<i>Shall we finish ourgame?</i>

899
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:26,188
It's your move.

900
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:36,487
I take your queen.

901
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:38,450
I didn't see that.

902
01:22:53,594 --> 01:22:55,961
- What is it?
- I see something dreadful.

903
01:22:56,138 --> 01:22:58,926
I can hardly even tell you.
- What is it?

904
01:22:59,057 --> 01:23:01,344
The knight is
playing chess over there.

905
01:23:01,852 --> 01:23:04,515
So I see.
Nothing dreadful about that.

906
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:06,603
Don't you see who he's playing?

907
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:08,849
He's all alone.
You mustn't scare me...

908
01:23:09,026 --> 01:23:11,018
No, he's not alone.

909
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:14,483
- Who's with him?
- Death.

910
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:17,406
He's playing chess
with Death himself.

911
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:19,572
You mustn't say such things.

912
01:23:19,703 --> 01:23:21,695
We have to get out of here.

913
01:23:22,289 --> 01:23:24,622
- We can't do that.
- We have to try.

914
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:28,664
They're engrossed in their game.
They won't notice if we slip away.

915
01:23:34,593 --> 01:23:36,960
Your move, Antonius Block.

916
01:23:41,517 --> 01:23:43,509
Have you lost interest in our game?

917
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:46,348
Lost interest?

918
01:23:47,189 --> 01:23:49,021
On the contrary.

919
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:53,522
You look anxious.
Are you hiding something?

920
01:23:55,197 --> 01:23:57,359
Nothing escapes you, does it?

921
01:23:57,908 --> 01:23:59,774
Nothing escapes me.

922
01:24:00,661 --> 01:24:02,698
No one escapes me.

923
01:24:03,997 --> 01:24:05,989
I am worried, it's true.

924
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:09,205
You're afraid.

925
01:24:17,344 --> 01:24:19,381
I've forgotten
how the pieces were.

926
01:24:22,099 --> 01:24:23,715
I haven't.

927
01:24:25,686 --> 01:24:27,973
You can't get off that easily.

928
01:24:37,322 --> 01:24:39,814
- I see something interesting.
- What do you see?

929
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:44,528
Mate at the next move.

930
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:49,665
True.

931
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,582
Was your reprieve of some use?

932
01:24:54,256 --> 01:24:56,248
Yes, it was.

933
01:24:57,217 --> 01:24:58,753
I'm glad.

934
01:25:00,387 --> 01:25:02,049
I'll be leaving you now.

935
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:05,090
When next we meet...

936
01:25:05,225 --> 01:25:08,218
you and your companions' time
will be up.

937
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,352
Will you reveal your secrets then?

938
01:25:14,401 --> 01:25:16,358
I have no secrets.

939
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:19,562
So you know nothing?

940
01:25:20,741 --> 01:25:22,198
I know nothing.

941
01:25:45,557 --> 01:25:47,594
What a strange light.

942
01:25:47,851 --> 01:25:50,468
It's the thunderstorm
that comes at dawn.

943
01:25:51,229 --> 01:25:53,767
No, it's something else,
something terrible.

944
01:25:53,899 --> 01:25:55,731
You hear that roaring
in the forest?

945
01:25:55,859 --> 01:25:57,441
Probably the rain.

946
01:25:57,569 --> 01:25:59,481
No, it's not the rain.

947
01:26:00,447 --> 01:26:02,530
He saw us. He's chasing us.

948
01:26:02,658 --> 01:26:05,150
He's caught up!
He's coming toward us!

949
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:21,548
Climb inside, Mia! Quick!

950
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:31,305
The Angel of Death is passing by...

951
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:33,804
and he's very large.

952
01:26:34,106 --> 01:26:35,893
You feel how cold it is?

953
01:28:39,648 --> 01:28:43,517
I heard from returning crusaders
that you were on your way home.

954
01:28:44,694 --> 01:28:46,651
I waited for you here.

955
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:48,817
The others all fled from the plague.

956
01:28:55,747 --> 01:28:58,205
Don't you recognize me anymore?

957
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:04,996
You've changed too.

958
01:29:12,722 --> 01:29:14,930
Now I can see it's you.

959
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:18,684
Somewhere in your eyes...

960
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,767
somewhere in your face...

961
01:29:23,233 --> 01:29:26,271
only hidden and frightened...

962
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:31,364
is the boy who went away
so many years ago.

963
01:29:33,326 --> 01:29:35,192
That's all over now...

964
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:37,703
and I'm a little tired.

965
01:29:38,498 --> 01:29:40,364
Do you regret having gone?

966
01:29:40,876 --> 01:29:42,287
No...

967
01:29:42,878 --> 01:29:44,619
I regret nothing.

968
01:29:45,755 --> 01:29:47,542
But I'm a little tired.

969
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:54,299
I can see that.

970
01:30:02,272 --> 01:30:04,685
My friends are over there.

971
01:30:07,861 --> 01:30:11,855
Have them come in.
I'll set the table for breakfast.

972
01:30:16,870 --> 01:30:20,955
<i>"And when the Lamb
had opened the seventh seal...</i>

973
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:24,833
<i>there was silence in heaven</i>

974
01:30:25,253 --> 01:30:28,496
about the space of half an hour.

975
01:30:29,466 --> 01:30:31,799
And the seven angels

976
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:34,881
who had the seven trumpets

977
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:39,345
prepared themselves to sound.

978
01:30:51,112 --> 01:30:54,696
The first angel
sounded his trumpet...

979
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:59,448
and there followed
hail and fire mingled with blood...

980
01:30:59,913 --> 01:31:03,122
and they were cast upon the earth.

981
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:07,619
And a third part of the earth
was burnt up...

982
01:31:08,421 --> 01:31:12,791
and a third part of the trees
was burnt up...

983
01:31:13,551 --> 01:31:17,135
and all the green grass
was burnt up.

984
01:31:18,848 --> 01:31:22,967
And the second angel
sounded his trumpet...

985
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:28,019
and as it were a great mountain
burning with fire

986
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:30,937
was cast into the sea.

987
01:31:31,194 --> 01:31:35,655
And a third part of the sea
became blood."

988
01:31:35,782 --> 01:31:37,273
Was anyone there?

989
01:31:42,998 --> 01:31:45,331
No, sire. I saw no one.

990
01:31:49,838 --> 01:31:53,206
"And the third angel

991
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:55,173
sounded his trumpet...

992
01:31:56,011 --> 01:31:59,470
and there fell
a great star from heaven...

993
01:32:00,849 --> 01:32:03,887
burning as if it were a lamp.

994
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:10,015
And the name of the star
is called Wormwood."

995
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:47,722
Good morning, noble lord.

996
01:32:49,564 --> 01:32:52,932
I am Karin, the knight's wife,

997
01:32:53,234 --> 01:32:56,318
and I bid you welcome to my house.

998
01:32:57,781 --> 01:33:00,319
I'm a smith by trade,

999
01:33:00,450 --> 01:33:03,568
and quite good,
if I say so myself.

1000
01:33:04,079 --> 01:33:06,071
My wife Lisa.

1001
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:09,323
Curtsy to the noble lord, Lisa.

1002
01:33:11,002 --> 01:33:15,417
She's a handful sometimes,
and we had a little spat,

1003
01:33:15,548 --> 01:33:18,256
but no worse than most people.

1004
01:33:19,219 --> 01:33:22,428
Out of our darkness
we call to thee, O Lord.

1005
01:33:22,889 --> 01:33:25,927
O God, have mercy on us,

1006
01:33:26,267 --> 01:33:29,726
for we are small
and frightened and ignorant.

1007
01:33:29,854 --> 01:33:32,471
In the darkness
where you claim to be,

1008
01:33:32,607 --> 01:33:35,020
where all of us probably are,

1009
01:33:35,151 --> 01:33:39,771
there's no one to hear your cries
or be moved by your suffering.

1010
01:33:40,490 --> 01:33:43,779
Dry your tears and mirror yourself
in your own indifference.

1011
01:33:43,952 --> 01:33:48,447
God, you who are somewhere,
who must be somewhere...

1012
01:33:49,165 --> 01:33:50,952
have mercy on us.

1013
01:33:51,417 --> 01:33:54,751
My herbs could have purged you
of your anxieties about eternity,

1014
01:33:54,879 --> 01:33:56,666
but now it's too late.

1015
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:59,332
Even so, feel the immense triumph
of this final moment,

1016
01:33:59,467 --> 01:34:01,959
when you can still roll your eyes
and wiggle your toes.

1017
01:34:02,137 --> 01:34:04,094
Quiet, quiet.

1018
01:34:04,222 --> 01:34:07,215
I will be quiet, but under protest!

1019
01:34:28,872 --> 01:34:30,829
It is finished.

1020
01:35:25,595 --> 01:35:28,429
I see them, Mia.

1021
01:35:29,515 --> 01:35:32,007
Over there,
under the dark, stormy sky.

1022
01:35:32,477 --> 01:35:34,389
They're all there:

1023
01:35:34,646 --> 01:35:36,478
the smith and Lisa,

1024
01:35:36,731 --> 01:35:39,565
the knight, Raval,
JÃ¶ns, and Skat.

1025
01:35:40,401 --> 01:35:44,395
And Death, the grim master,
bids them dance.

1026
01:35:45,198 --> 01:35:47,565
He commands them to hold hands

1027
01:35:47,951 --> 01:35:50,694
and dance in a long line.

1028
01:35:51,704 --> 01:35:55,914
The stern master leads the way
with his scythe and hourglass.

1029
01:35:56,501 --> 01:36:00,245
But Skat dangles
at the end with his lyre.

1030
01:36:01,422 --> 01:36:05,132
They dance away from the dawn

1031
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,672
in a solemn dance,

1032
01:36:08,429 --> 01:36:10,796
away to the dark country,

1033
01:36:11,432 --> 01:36:14,220
while the rain runs down
over their faces...

1034
01:36:15,186 --> 01:36:18,475
and washes away
their salty tears.

1035
01:36:23,111 --> 01:36:25,444
You and your visions.
