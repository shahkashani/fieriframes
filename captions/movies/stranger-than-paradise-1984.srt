00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,631
I don't have to stay here.
We're playing a fucking game here, man!

353
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:31,523
Get your fucking hands off me!
What the fuck? Hey.

354
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,949
You're his fucking partner too, right?

355
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,277
I never met the guy.
I'm never playing with you again.

356
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,987
Get out of here, man!

357
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,769
And you two, man... you just sit there, right?
What, he's leaving too?

358
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:45,127
Yeah, he's leaving, yeah.
You picked up on that, huh?

359
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,125
Both of you, man,
you just sit there, you know.

360
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:50,049
You don't fuckin' stick up
for yourselves or nothin', man!

361
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,967
I don't know what the fuck
is the matter with both of youse.

362
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:58,720
And you let those animals
in your fucking house too, right?

363
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:13,023
[muttering]

364
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:16,109
Willie, what are we stoppin' in here for?

365
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:19,321
We gotta watch those guys.
They knew somethin' was up.

366
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,657
Tomorrow we got the track,

367
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:25,539
then with this, we're doin' pretty good.

368
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:29,171
What's your brother-in-law's name? Max?
Yeah.

369
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,750
Can we borrow a car from Max?
Yeah, I guess.

370
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,698
Hey, what do we want a car for?
You want to leave town because of those guys?

371
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:38,402
No! Those guys are a bunch of lightweights.
I don't care about them.

372
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:41,537
I just want to get out of here and see
something different for a few days, you know?

373
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:44,304
Yeah? I don't know.

374
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:46,685
Hey, where would we go?

375
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:50,185
Hey, Willie, where would we go?
I don't know.

376
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,361
Hey, Eddie.

377
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,281
Eddie!

378
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:10,212
Eddie!
Willie! What's that... What do you want?

379
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,210
Oh, I don't want nothin'.

380
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,383
Think this thing's gonna make it
to Cleveland?

381
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:17,052
Yeah, it'll make it to Cleveland.

382
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:20,631
Well, if it don't, we'll just ditch it,
you know, take a bus back.

383
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,968
Won't Max mind?
What can Max do about it?

384
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,975
Hey, pull over over here.
Yeah? Why?

385
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,977
I want to talk to this guy.
Yeah?

386
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,696
Excuse me.

387
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:38,528
Sir?

388
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,945
Sir!
What do you want?

389
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,577
Could you come here a minute?
What do you want?

390
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:49,286
Could you come over here a minute?
I'm just waiting for the bus.

391
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:52,497
I want to ask you directions.
What?

392
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:54,833
Just come here, so I don't have to yell.

393
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,254
Can you tell me which way is Cleveland?

394
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,926
Give me a break, man.
I'm just going to work.

395
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,266
Where do you work?

396
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,268
In a factory.

397
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,438
Let's go.

398
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:20,283
I don't know, Willie.
Ah, the poor guy. God.

399
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:23,532
You shouldn't have given him
such a hard time.

400
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,659
Can you imagine working in a factory?

401
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,958
No, I can't.

402
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:31,036
Now I feel bad.

403
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,121
Nah, don't feel bad.

404
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:37,299
Hey, Eddie.

405
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,377
Ah, cut it out, Willie.

406
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:53,983
Willie, when we get to Cleveland,
where are we gonna stay?

407
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:56,812
With your cousin Eva and, uh, your aunt?

408
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:59,067
No.

409
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,649
Do you think your cousin Eva
will remember me?

410
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:03,359
I doubt it, Eddie.

411
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,663
How much money we got?
Oh, we got a lot.

412
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:12,084
How much is a lot, Eddie?
We got a lot. We got almost $600.

413
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,454
You're all right, Eddie.

414
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:21,336
You know?
We're a couple of rich men now.

415
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,642
This is terrible, Eddie.
The weather's getting worse.

416
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,733
Look at all the snow here.

417
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,525
You think we're in Ohio yet?

418
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:46,994
Nah, I think we're still in Pennsylvania.

419
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:29,362
Say, Willie.
Yeah?

420
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:33,575
You know, last year,
before I met your cousin,

421
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:37,378
I never knew you were from Hungary
or Budapest or any of those places.

422
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:38,796
So what?

423
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:43,376
I thought you were an American.

424
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,803
Hey, I'm as American as you are.

425
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:11,487
Does Cleveland look a little
like, uh, Budapest?

426
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:13,197
Eddie, shut up.

427
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:36,368
Willie? You asleep?

428
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,198
No, I'm not asleep.

429
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,791
[sniffs, sighs]

430
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:05,484
[dog barking]

431
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,460
Who are you?
Hi.

432
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,792
Who is there?
It's me, Bela.

433
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,822
You don't remember me?
Bela Molnar. I'm your nephew.

434
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:18,807
No, I don't see you about ten years.
How can I... thinking of you?

435
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:21,636
You happy to see me?
I am very happy to see you.

436
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,641
Yeah.
Who is that fella?

437
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,223
This is my friend Eddie.
I'm glad to see you.

438
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,525
Hi!
I'm glad to see you.

439
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,978
I'm glad to see you too. Come on in.

440
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:32,938
Okay.
Come on in.

441
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,076
Come on in.

442
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,576
Thank you. Thank you.

446
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,463
Oh, we're not really hungry.

447
00:41:57,557 --> 00:42:00,220
Goulash, chicken paprika.

449
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,642

No. [speaking Hungarian]

451
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:10,814

[Hungarian]

467
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:23,223
We gotta pick her up at, uh...

00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:29,479
Okay?
Yeah, that sounds good.

470
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:35,319

I can't believe it!

484
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:48,301
What are you guys doing here?
Well, we're on vacation, like, you know.

485
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,394
Really?
Yeah.

486
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:52,475
You came from New York?
Yeah. We have a car and everything.

487
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:54,852
Oh, yeah?
We borrowed it.

488
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:57,400
[chuckles] Are you in trouble?

489
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:59,569
Mm-mmm. No.

490
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,817
How did you guys find me here?

491
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:05,151
We went to Aunt Lotte's house,
and she told us that you were here.

492
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:07,827
Oh. You already saw her, huh?
Yeah.

493
00:45:07,914 --> 00:45:09,871
So, can you stay for a few days?

494
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:12,870
Yeah, we could. Why not? I don't know.
Yeah.

495
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,794
Oh, I'm so happy to see you.
You want a hot dog?

496
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,213
No, no.
No.

497
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:21,007
You already ate, right?
Yeah.

498
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:23,585
So, I have a little more work to do...
like, 20 minutes.

499
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,841
Can you wait for me?
Mm-hmm.

500
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:30,176
Yeah. We came to pick you up.
All right. I'll hurry up. Okay?

501
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:33,603
Yeah, but I think we should wait in the car,
'cause I don't like it in here.

502
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,180
Neither do I.
Yeah?

503
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,640
All right, I'll hurry up.
Okay.

504
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,066
Just 20 minutes.
Yep.

505
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,650
Come on.

506
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,232
I told you she'd remember me.
Well, good.

507
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,745
[footsteps]

508
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,747
[man] So, anyway...

509
00:45:56,837 --> 00:46:00,751
anyways, it seems it's in the cards that I might
be getting a raise down at the gas station.

510
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:01,800
Uh-huh.

511
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:03,737
Hey, you said you'd go with me
to the movies the other night.

512
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:08,472
You wanna go see <i>Space Wizards</i>
or that foreign flick down at the Olympia?

513
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:10,719
Uh, <i>Days Without Sun</i>. You wanna see that?

514
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:13,302
I don't know. Isn't there a kung fu movie?

515
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:16,305
I can go and check. We'll see.

516
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:18,516
Yeah, check and call me up. Okay?

517
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:19,975
Yeah.
All right. Bye.

518
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:21,480
Bye, Eva.

519
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:24,650
[Eddie] Hi.

01:00:56,736 --> 01:01:01,902
This is nice.

689
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:06,657
<i>♪ Whoo, no runnin' around ♪</i>

690
01:01:07,956 --> 01:01:10,790
[music continues]
I haven't heard it in a long time.

691
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,918

692
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:20,250

[vehicle passes]

694
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:04,524
Now we look like real tourists.

695
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:09,192
Pretty classy.

696
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:13,947

01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:53,380
[knocking]

698
01:04:59,771 --> 01:05:03,936
Eva, I want you to stay down until the motel guy
comes out and goes back in his office.

699
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:05,687
Why?

700
01:05:05,777 --> 01:05:09,771
Why pay for three people? It's fine.
I thought you guys said you were rich.

701
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:11,856
Shh! Get down. Get down.

702
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,578
Hey. How you doing?
Hi there. How are ya?

703
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:19,075
Fine.

704
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:27,296
Wait till he goes in and then come around
the other side. Room number three.

705
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:28,998
Number three?
Yeah.

706
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:51,646
Man, I'm beat.

707
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:53,731
I'm so tired.

708
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,952
What, you finished the peanuts?

709
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:04,033
Yeah.

710
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:06,709
Then what'd you pack 'em for?

711
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:20,090
Jesus, Eva!

712
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:24,223
The idea was for you to sneak in.
You understand?

713
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:25,805
I don't care.

714
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:28,853
This looks familiar.

715
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:32,691
This is for you.

716
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:36,358
Huh?
This is for you.

717
01:06:36,451 --> 01:06:38,238
Oh, no. I'm not sleeping on that.

718
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:40,945
One of you guys can sleep there.
I'm taking the bed.

719
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:46,075
I fell asleep
waiting out there in the car.

720
01:06:46,169 --> 01:06:50,163
Now I'm cold.
I want a comfortable bed, at least.

721
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:58,170
Amazin'.

722
01:07:03,937 --> 01:07:05,678
[sighs]

723
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:11,354
Hey, that water smells funny.

724
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:16,780
Uh-uh-uh. I'm not gonna sleep on this cot.

725
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:21,360
[Eva chuckles]
You guys think it's so funny.

726
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:23,366
No, it's... They're good, you know.

727
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:25,368
Yeah, yeah.

728
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:27,370
I love you guys...

729
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:32,751
but this is a bitch.

730
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:38,885
[Eva] Can we all go to the beach tomorrow?

731
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:41,259
[Willie] After we go to the track.

732
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:48,141
Hey, Willie, we should
check out the dog races.

733
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:56,145
I don't like the idea of dog races.

734
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:01,033
[Eddie grunts]

735
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:03,781
[Eva] Be quiet so I can sleep.

736
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:06,864
Yeah, go to sleep so we can start
enjoying our vacation. All right?

737
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:17,424
[Willie sighs]

738
01:08:36,321 --> 01:08:37,903
It's okay.

739
01:08:39,157 --> 01:08:42,321
Looks very nice.
I'll forgive you guys.

740
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:44,026
[Willie chuckles]

741
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:50,574
Hey, Willie, man,
let's check these dog races out.

742
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:57,335
I got a good feeling.
I feel like we're gonna make a lot of money.

743
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:00,876
Really?
Yeah. It's one of those feelings.

744
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:03,795
Yeah.

745
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:10,394
Uh, yeah, maybe it's a good idea.
I don't know.

746
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:16,934
[Willie sighs]

747
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:20,062
[Willie] Dog races. [grunts]

748
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:26,069
[Eddie sighs]

749
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:31,118
[Eddie] Have sweet dreams.

750
01:09:31,209 --> 01:09:32,745
[Eva] Good night.

751
01:09:49,519 --> 01:09:51,385
[groans]

752
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:00,644
Willie?

753
01:10:04,492 --> 01:10:06,404
Mmm.

754
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:20,627
Willie. Eddie?

755
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:27,137
Shit.

756
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:39,516
Fuck!

757
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:42,815
That's nice.

758
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:51,946
They could have left a fucking note.

759
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:03,540
Shit.

760
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:36,039
Can't fucking believe it.

761
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:40,998
Vacation starts great.

762
01:11:51,682 --> 01:11:54,675
[birds calling]

763
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:23,556
[car doors opening, closing]

764
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:49,336
Where the fuck have you been all day?
You didn't even leave me a note.

765
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:52,384
I'm here alone in the middle of nowhere.
I don't know anybody.

766
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:55,304
And you can't do that much...
leave me a note when you leave.

767
01:13:56,474 --> 01:13:58,994
[muttering] Shut up, Eva...
Don't tell me to shut up! What is this?

768
01:13:59,018 --> 01:14:02,352
I thought we were going to Miami.
This is nowhere.

769
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:06,460
Man, you said you had a good feeling. Right?
I <i>had</i> a good feeling, Willie.

770
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:08,754
"Good feeling" is supposed to mean
that something's supposed to happen.

771
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:11,987
Not just like this...
You can't win 'em all, Willie.

772
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:16,108
What's going on?

773
01:14:16,202 --> 01:14:20,663
You take me to dog races and then you say,
"You can't win 'em all"?

774
01:14:20,748 --> 01:14:22,910
It's the name of the game!

775
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,413
What's going on?
Nothin'.

776
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:31,086
Nothin's going on.
Just lost almost all our money.

777
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:32,962
At dog races?

778
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:47,815
You lost all the money?
Yeah.

779
01:14:49,026 --> 01:14:50,517
God.

780
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:01,487
I'm sorry.

781
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:22,174
What are we gonna do now?

782
01:16:41,764 --> 01:16:45,474
Look, Willie, let's get outta here.
We got 50 bucks. Let's go back to New York.

783
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:48,597
I'm not goin' back to New York with no money.
What do you wanna do?

784
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:52,397
I wanna go to the track
and I wanna bet on horses, not on dogs.

785
01:16:52,483 --> 01:16:54,896
I knew you were gonna say
something like this. Come on.

786
01:16:54,985 --> 01:16:57,318
I have this terrible feeling
if we go back to the track.

787
01:16:57,404 --> 01:16:59,566
Your feelings haven't been
doing us any good.

788
01:17:02,785 --> 01:17:06,699
This is a great vacation.
Oh, shut up, Eva. Come on. Let's go.

789
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:09,702
Anything you say, Willie.
Anything you say.

790
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:12,205
Eva, what are you doing?
What do you mean?

791
01:17:12,294 --> 01:17:14,206
You're not coming with us.
What?

792
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,775
She should come with us. It'll be good luck.
She's stayin' here.

793
01:17:16,799 --> 01:17:19,792
Willie, I think she should come with us.
She's stayin' here!

794
01:17:21,804 --> 01:17:23,636
Get out. Get out!
I'm sorry, Eva.

795
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:26,260
You're the same. Just go.
I'm sorry.

796
01:17:28,227 --> 01:17:33,063
Willie, she's been in the motel all day.
We should take her with us.

797
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,772
[vehicle passes]

798
01:18:36,045 --> 01:18:39,209
Yo, little freak,
where the fuck you been at, man?

799
01:18:39,298 --> 01:18:41,460
Where you been at, man?
Wha...

800
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,758
Shit, man...
Yo, I mean, you the freak, right?

801
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:47,008
You got the hat on, man.
I see the dome piece on your top, man. Listen.

802
01:18:47,097 --> 01:18:50,465
You're supposed to take this shit, man.
You make me miss my motherfuckin' sniff, man.

803
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:54,052
Here, take this shit, man. You tell Rammell
that I ain't down with this no more.

804
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:57,765
You cool? You clean?
There you go. Good-bye. Peace.

805
01:18:57,942 --> 01:18:59,934
No shit.

806
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:12,905
[people shouting in distance]

807
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:40,936
Willie? Eddie?

808
01:19:57,876 --> 01:19:59,868
Whew.

809
01:21:10,657 --> 01:21:14,651
[Eddie, Willie chanting]

810
01:21:18,332 --> 01:21:19,823
Eva?

811
01:21:22,503 --> 01:21:24,665
Eva?
I told you horses, not dogs.

812
01:21:24,755 --> 01:21:26,417
You don't ever listen to me. Right?

813
01:21:26,507 --> 01:21:29,591
Horses. Horses. Definitely horses.

814
01:21:30,844 --> 01:21:33,507
Give me that. Give me that!
Get the fuck outta here!

815
01:21:33,597 --> 01:21:35,884
Come on. [laughs]

816
01:21:38,644 --> 01:21:40,556
Hey, it's dark in here.

817
01:21:40,646 --> 01:21:43,059
You see Mighty Joy?
Did you see Mighty Joy?

818
01:21:43,148 --> 01:21:46,482
[imitates speeding engine]
Yeah, it was great. He was great.

819
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:49,481
Think I'll shed some light
on the situation.

820
01:21:49,988 --> 01:21:51,479
Huh.
[spits]

821
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:53,189
Come on, you idiot!

822
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:01,368
Hey, look at this.
What is that?

823
01:22:04,378 --> 01:22:06,119
My God, Willie!

824
01:22:08,298 --> 01:22:10,756
What is that? What does it say?

825
01:22:10,843 --> 01:22:13,210
[exhales]
It's from Eva. It's in Hungarian.

826
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:17,179
What does it say?
Aw, this is stupid.

827
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:19,599
She's goin' to the airport.

828
01:22:21,019 --> 01:22:24,332
We can't let her go to the airport. She's really...
Where did she get all this money?

829
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:26,518
I don't know where she got the money.

830
01:22:27,693 --> 01:22:29,434
We should get her, eh?
Yeah.

831
01:22:29,528 --> 01:22:31,815
All right, that's fine. Let's go.
All right.

832
01:22:32,823 --> 01:22:34,815
We'll leave this place, eh?

833
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:38,827
Where did she get all this money?

834
01:22:40,747 --> 01:22:43,410
Are you packed?
Yeah. I'm ready to go.

835
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:46,367
Is this Eva's hat?

836
01:22:48,046 --> 01:22:50,038
It looks like Eva's hat.

837
01:22:52,426 --> 01:22:54,418
Where'd she get that hat?

838
01:22:57,055 --> 01:22:59,468
Willie, come on, will ya?
Let's get outta here.

839
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,973
You got all the money?
Yeah, I got everything.

840
01:23:04,062 --> 01:23:06,645
Take the bottle.
Don't you want your peanuts?

841
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:09,224
Why should I want the peanuts?
There's nothin' in it.

[typing on keyboard]

843
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:28,497
Yes, there is one remaining flight
to Europe today.

844
01:23:28,587 --> 01:23:32,831
It leaves in about 45 minutes.
You have plenty of time to board.

845
01:23:32,925 --> 01:23:35,508
It's a flight to Eastern Europe...
to Budapest.

846
01:23:35,594 --> 01:23:38,712
To Budapest?
There's a flight from here to Budapest?

847
01:23:38,805 --> 01:23:40,512
Yes, there is.

848
01:23:40,599 --> 01:23:43,828
That's the only flight to Europe you have?
Well, it's the only flight we have today.

849
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:46,640
We have several tomorrow.
I can check on those for you.

We have a flight to Paris at 2:05.

853
01:23:58,909 --> 01:24:01,151
Although you will have to wait
until tomorrow.

854
01:24:01,245 --> 01:24:03,077
What time does the plane leave again?

855
01:24:03,163 --> 01:24:06,577
The flight for Budapest departs
in about 44 minutes.

856
01:24:07,668 --> 01:24:10,126
Hmm.

857
01:24:14,216 --> 01:24:17,129
...are talking about, sir.
Shall I explain it more clearly?

858
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:19,131
You're a whack-off. You know that?

859
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:21,133
You have a nice day too, sir.

860
01:24:21,223 --> 01:24:23,761
What's goin' on, Willie?
This jerk says she was just here.

861
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:27,139
Yeah?
She's got on... He <i>thinks</i> she got on some flight.

862
01:24:27,229 --> 01:24:28,640
So? What do you got a ticket for?

863
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:32,644
I had to buy the ticket so I can
get on the plane to take her off the plane.

864
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:35,067
Here. Take this.

865
01:24:35,153 --> 01:24:37,486
When's the plane?

866
01:24:37,573 --> 01:24:39,467
In, like, five minutes.
You'd better hurry up.

867
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:43,388
All right, meet me at the car in ten minutes.
I'll be back at the car. Don't worry. I'll be there.

868
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:45,654
You all right?
Yeah. I'll see you later.

869
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:47,488
All right.
I'll be at the car.
