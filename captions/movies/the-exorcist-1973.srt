1
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,287
Sure do love you.

2
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,915
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mrs. MacNeil.

3
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,001
- How are you today?
- Fine, thank you.

4
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,461
That's good.

5
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:37,380
It's okay, I've got it. Thanks.

6
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,091
- Good morning, madam.
- Good morning, Karl.

7
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:44,179
Oh, Karl, we've got rats in the attic.
You'd better get some traps.

8
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:47,682
- Rats?
- I'm afraid so.

9
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,142
But the attic is clean.

10
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,060
All right, then, we've got clean rats.

11
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:54,522
- No, no. No rats.
- I just heard them, Karl.

12
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,940
Maybe plumbing.

13
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,277
Yeah, or maybe rats.
Now, will you just get the traps?

14
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,695
Yes, I go now.

15
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,739
Don't go now.
The stores aren't open yet.

16
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,657
- I'll go see.
- They're closed!

17
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,291
<i>In the group over here...</i>

18
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,704
<i>...I need a priest, a nun
and two students.</i>

19
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:14,209
<i>That's what we want.
That's exactly what we want.</i>

20
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,714
Burke. Oh, Burke.

21
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,716
- Is this scene really essential?
- Chris.

22
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,676
Just consider if we can do without it.

23
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,679
Take a look at this damn thing.
It just doesn't make sense.

24
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:30,725
It's plain. You're a teacher of the college.
You don't want the building torn down.

25
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,145
- Come on. I can read, for Christ's sake.
- Well, what's wrong?

26
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,564
Well, why are they tearing
the building down?

27
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,734
Shall we summon the writer?
He's in Paris, I believe.

28
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,069
- Hiding?
- Fucking.

29
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,741
Scene 39: Hotel. Take four.

30
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,744
<i>All right. Hustle, background. And action.</i>

31
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,512
<i>Hasn't there been enough killing?</i>

32
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,624
<i>Is this your campus?</i>

33
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,087
<i>Get the Defense Department
off this campus!</i>

34
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,924
<i>It's our school!</i>

35
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,093
<i>- You have no rights!</i>
- Hypocrite!

36
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,220
<i>Military complex, man!</i>

37
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,138
<i>And action, Chris.</i>

38
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,349
<i>I've seen enough killing in my lifetime!</i>

39
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,019
<i>There's no need for it!</i>

40
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:20,400
<i>That's right! That's right!</i>

41
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,445
<i>We're all concerned with human rights,
for God's sake...</i>

42
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:27,448
<i>...but the kids who want
to get an education have a right too!</i>

43
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:36,791
<i>Don't you understand? It's against
your own principle, for God's sake!</i>

44
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:42,630
<i>You can't accomplish anything by
shutting kids off from their...</i>

45
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:51,055
<i>- if you want... Hold it, hold it!</i>
- Quiet!

46
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:54,642
<i>If you want to effect any change,
you have to do it within the system.</i>

47
00:14:57,521 --> 00:15:00,231
<i>Okay, cut. That's a wrap.</i>

48
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,458
- I'll walk home tonight.
- Okay.

49
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,085
Here, take that
and drop it at my house, yeah?

50
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,087
- Good night, Tom.
- Good night.

51
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,586
There's not a day in my life
that I don't feel like a fraud.

52
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,074
I mean, priests, doctors, lawyers.
I've talked to them all.

53
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,108
I don't know anyone who hasn't
felt that.

54
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,391
Hello?

55
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:17,976
In here.

56
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,854
- Hi. How did your day go?
- Oh, not too bad.

57
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:25,316
It was like the, uh, Walt Disney version
of the Ho Chi Minh story.

58
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,734
Other than that, terrific.

59
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,529
- What we got, anything exciting?
- Here.

60
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,240
- Oh, all right.
- And also, you got an invitation.

61
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,951
- What's this?
- Dinner at the White House.

62
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,370
You're kidding.
Is it a big party or something?

63
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,830
I think it's five or six people.

64
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,833
Oh. Thursday, huh? All right.

65
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,042
Hi, Mom.

66
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,044
What'd you do today?

67
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,879
- Stuff.
- What's that mean, stuff?

68
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:50,883
Well, uh, me and Sharon played a game
in the backyard.

69
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,386
- You did.
- And we had a picnic down by the river.

70
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,388
That sounds good.

71
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,597
You should have seen.

72
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:59,767
This man came along on this
beautiful gray horse.

73
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,644
- Really? What kind?
- Wasn't he pretty?

74
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,896
Was it a mare, a gelding, what?

75
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,107
- I think it was a gelding.
- Mm-hm.

76
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,901
It was gray. Oh, it was so beautiful.

77
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,320
The guy let me ride it all around
and everything.

78
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,489
- You're kidding.
- She rode for half an hour.

79
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:18,578
It was so nice. Oh, I loved it.
Oh, Mom, can't we get a horse?

80
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:22,123
- Not while we're in Washington, honey.
- Why not, Mom? Ha, ha.

81
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,125
We'll see when we get home, okay?

82
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,919
- When could I have one?
- We'll see, Regan. We'll see.

83
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:30,298
Hey, listen, on the party invitations,
I wanted to write a personal...

84
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,217
- Regan, don't! Regan, come back here!
- Ha-ha-ha.

85
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,308
- All right, give it up. Give it up!
- No!

86
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,435
- Ooh!
- Ha-ha-ha.

87
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,228
- You'll be sorry! Come on.
- No!

88
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,511
Father?

89
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,138
Could you help an old altar boy?

90
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,348
I'm a Catholic.

91
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,540
All right, come on, man.

92
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,968
- What, are you crazy?
- Go ahead.

93
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:55,019
Mama?

94
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,954
Dimmy! Dimmy!

95
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,293
Oh, how are you, Mama?

96
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,629
- I'm so glad to see you.
- You look good.

97
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,505
I'm all right.

98
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,133
- How's your leg?
- How about you? You are all right?

99
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,635
I'm fine, Mama. I'm fine.

100
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,893
Your Uncle John passed by to visit me.

101
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,395
- Oh, really? When?
- Last month.

102
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,319
- Too tight?
- No.

103
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:43,407
You have to stay off it. You can't go up and
down the stairs. You have to give it a rest.

104
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,992
Okay.

105
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:58,923
I could take you somewhere where
you'd be safe. You wouldn't be alone.

106
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,885
There would be people around. You wouldn't
be sitting here listening to a radio.

107
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,891
You understand me?

108
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:13,771
This is my house
and I'm not going no place.

109
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,869
Dimmy, you worry for something?

110
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,038
- No, Mama.
- You are not happy?

111
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,957
Tell me, what is the matter?

112
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,294
Mama, I'm all right. I'm fine.
Really, I am.

113
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,996
Here it comes.

114
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,497
There.

115
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,108
- Oh, look at that.
- Do you like it?

116
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,921
Aw, isn't that funny? Ha, ha.

117
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:24,759
I better put him over here to dry, though.
He's still wet.

118
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:27,219
Oh, here we go.

119
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,930
There, he can dry there.

120
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:32,266
Hey, where'd this come from?

121
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,853
- I found it.
- Where?

122
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,606
Closet.

123
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,150
Huh.

124
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,943
You been playing with it?

125
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,112
- Yup.
- Do you know how?

126
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,114
I'll show you.

127
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,787
Wait a minute. You need two.

128
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:56,248
No, you don't. I do it all the time.

129
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,626
Oh, yeah? Well, let's both play with it.

130
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,963
You really don't want me to play, huh?

131
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:06,342
No, I do. Captain Howdy said no.

132
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,470
- Captain who?
- Captain Howdy.

133
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,138
Who's Captain Howdy?

134
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:15,017
You know. I make the questions
and he does the answers.

135
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:18,854
- Oh, Captain Howdy. Yeah, I see.
- He's nice.

136
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,981
Oh, I'll bet he is.

137
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,984
- Here, I'll show you.
- All right.

138
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:28,155
Captain Howdy,
do you think my mom's pretty?

139
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,118
Captain Howdy?

140
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,370
Captain Howdy, that isn't very nice.

141
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,039
- Well, maybe he's sleeping.
- You think?

142
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,919
Regan, why are you reading that stuff?

143
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,337
Because I like it.

144
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,257
It's not even a good picture of you.
Look at that.

145
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,009
- You look so mature.
- I wouldn't talk.

146
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:52,179
You wouldn't talk?
Well, I didn't know they were taking it.

147
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,348
I didn't have my makeup man there.

148
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,184
Let me take an eyelash off your face.

149
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:59,520
Okay. No, I didn't get it.

150
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,939
- Mm.
- What are we gonna do on your birthday?

151
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,984
Isn't it nice it's on Sunday this year?

152
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,278
No work? What can we do?

153
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,487
I don't know.

154
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:09,935
Well, what would you like to do?

155
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,991
- Got any ideas?
- Mm-mm.

156
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,826
Hmm?

157
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,829
Let me think. Let me think.
What can we do?

158
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,707
Hey, we never finished seeing
all the sights in Washington.

159
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,209
Didn't get to Lee Mansion
and lots of stuff.

160
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:25,880
Shall we do that? Go sightseeing?
If it's a nice day?

161
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:28,174
- Yeah, let's do that.
- Okay.

162
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:33,762
And tomorrow night,
I'll take you to a movie. Okay?

163
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,848
Oh, I love you.

164
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,559
I love you, Rags.

165
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,271
We'll have a good day, yeah?

166
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:45,357
You can bring Mr. Dennings, if you like.

167
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,151
Mr. Dennings?

168
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,403
Well, you know, it's okay.

169
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:50,863
Well, thank you very much...

170
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:54,033
...but why on earth would I wanna bring
Burke on your birthday?

171
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,743
Well, you like him.

172
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:59,872
Yeah, I like him. Don't you like him?
Hey, what's going on? What is this?

173
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,542
- You're gonna marry him, aren't you?
- Oh, my God. Are you kidding?

174
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,377
- What?
- Me marry Burke Dennings?

175
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,671
Don't be silly. Of course not.

176
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,757
Where did you ever get an idea like that?

177
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,926
But you like him.

178
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:15,930
Of course I like him. I like pizzas too,
but I'm not gonna marry one.

179
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,349
You don't like him like Daddy?

180
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,769
Regan, I love your daddy.

181
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,188
I'll always love your daddy, honey.

182
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:27,942
Okay? Burke just comes
around here a lot, because...

183
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,779
...well, he's lonely.
He don't got nothing to do.

184
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:35,032
Well, I heard differently.

185
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,535
Oh, you did? What did you hear, huh?

186
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,454
- I don't know. I just thought.
- Come on. What did you hear?

187
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,289
Well, you didn't think so good.

188
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,667
- How do you know? Ha, ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

189
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:47,503
Because Burke and I are just friends.
Okay? Really.

190
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:48,796
Okay.

191
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,215
You ready for sleep?

192
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:56,053
- Good night.
- Good night, honey.

193
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,701
It's my mother, Tom.

194
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,870
She's alone. I never should have left her.

195
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:26,333
At least in New York, I'd be near her.
I'd be close to her.

196
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:29,169
I could see about a transfer, Damien.

197
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,593
I need reassignment, Tom. I want out of
this job. It's wrong, it's no good.

198
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,845
You're the best we've got.

199
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,723
Am I really?

200
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:45,352
It's more than psychiatry,
and you know that, Tom.

201
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,314
Some of their problems come down
to faith...

202
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:52,026
...their vocation, the meaning of their
lives, and I can't cut it anymore.

203
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:59,575
I need out. I'm unfit.

204
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,706
Think I've lost my faith, Tom.

205
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,210
Hello?

206
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,880
Yes, this is Mrs. MacNeil.

207
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:15,007
Operator, you have got to be kidding!

208
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:18,135
I have been on this line for 20 minutes!

209
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,596
Jesus Christ. Can you believe this?

210
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,557
He doesn't even call his daughter
on her birthday.

211
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:26,018
- Maybe the circuit is busy.
- Oh, circuits, my ass!

212
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,561
He doesn't give a shit.

213
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:31,190
- Why don't you let me...?
- No, I've got it, Sharon. It's all right.

214
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:34,318
Yes. No, operator,
don't tell me there's no answer.

215
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,278
It's the Hotel Excelsior in Rome.

216
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,073
Would you try it again, please,
and let it ring?

217
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,241
Hello? Yes.

218
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:46,121
No, operator,
I've given you the number four times.

219
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:49,667
Do you take an illiteracy test to get
that job, for Christ's sakes?

220
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,211
Don't tell me to be calm, goddamn it!

221
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,390
Yeah?

222
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,685
You're kidding me.

223
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:13,065
Okay. I thought I just went to bed.

224
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,734
Yeah.

225
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:18,654
Hey, what are we doing, scene 61?

226
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:22,825
Okay. Oh, just remind Flo about
that blue belt, huh?

227
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,952
All right. Yeah, I'll see you.

228
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,008
What are you doing here?

229
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,553
My bed was shaking.

230
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,763
I can't get to sleep.

231
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,974
Oh, honey.

232
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,515
Goddamn it.

233
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,645
Jesus.

234
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:54,810
There's nothing.

235
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,062
Oh, Karl.

236
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,399
Jesus Christ, Karl, don't do that.

237
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:03,026
Very sorry, but you see, no rats.

238
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,904
No rats. Thanks a lot. That's terrific.

239
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:15,265
Oh, my God.

240
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:36,370
Okay. Unroll your fist.

241
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,372
Arm up.

242
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:41,291
Very good. That wasn't so bad, was it?

243
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:44,461
Remain perfectly still. Breathe normally.

244
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:00,394
Tell me if you feel a vibration.

245
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,355
Regan?

246
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,569
You feel anything?

247
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,572
Can you feel this?

248
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,700
I don't feel anything.

249
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,708
Put this in your mouth.

250
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,252
Keep it there.
This tells your temperature.

251
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,797
When the red light goes on,
that's your temperature.

252
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,216
I don't want it.

253
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,794
A disorder of the nerves.

254
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:09,421
At least we think it is.

255
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,506
We don't know yet exactly how it works.

256
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:14,134
It's often seen in early adolescence.

257
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,761
She shows all the symptoms.

258
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,804
Hyperactivity.

259
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,556
Her temper.

260
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,975
Performance in math.

261
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,394
Yeah. Why the math? What is that?

262
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,646
It affects her concentration.

263
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,482
Ah-ha.

264
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:32,360
- Now, this is for Ritalin.
- Okay.

265
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:34,780
Ten milligrams a day.

266
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:36,531
Is that a tranquilizer?

267
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:37,866
It's a stimulant.

268
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,660
A stimulant? My God,
she's higher than a kite now.

269
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:43,622
Her condition isn't quite what it seems.

270
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,666
Nobody knows the cause of hyperkinetic
behavior in a child.

271
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:49,294
The Ritalin seems to work
to relieve the condition.

272
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:51,838
And as to how or why,
we really don't know.

273
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:56,343
But, uh, her symptoms could be
overreaction to depression.

274
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,178
That's out of my field.

275
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,931
My daughter isn't depressed.

276
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:06,019
Well, you mentioned her father
and the separation.

277
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,855
You think I should take her
to a psychiatrist?

278
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:12,442
No. I think we should wait
and see what happens with the Ritalin.

279
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,694
I think that's the answer.

280
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:17,489
- Okay.
- Let's wait two, three weeks.

281
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:21,076
All right. And the lies she's been telling?
That's part of it, huh?

282
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:24,663
- Lies?
- Like saying her bed's shaking. That stuff.

283
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:29,084
Have you ever known your daughter
to swear?

284
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:32,045
- To use obscenities?
- No, never.

285
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:35,215
Hmm. Interesting.

286
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:40,137
Similar... Similar to
things like her lying...

287
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:44,224
- ...it's uncharacteristic for her.
- I don't understand. She doesn't swear.

288
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:48,687
Well, she let loose quite a string
while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.

289
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:53,066
I find that hard to believe.
What did she say?

290
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:57,737
Her vocabulary is rather extensive.

291
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:00,073
Well, give me an example. Like what?

292
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,450
Specifically, what did she say?

293
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,411
Specifically, Mrs. MacNeil...

294
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,748
...she advised me to keep my fingers
away from her...

295
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,751
...goddamn cunt.

296
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,550
I can't believe it.

297
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,431
- She...
- You don't think a psychiatrist...?

298
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:28,435
No. I think the best explanation
is always the simplest.

299
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:32,189
- Well, we'll wait. We'll wait and see.
- Yeah.

300
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:35,609
So in the meantime...

301
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,360
...try not to worry.

302
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,113
How?

303
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,534
The edema affected her brain,
you understand?

304
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,578
She don't let no doctor come near her.

305
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:49,164
She was all the time screaming,
talking to the radio.

306
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,917
- You should've called me when it happened.
- Listen.

307
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:54,085
Regular hospital not gonna
put up with that.

308
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:56,171
We give her a shot and bring her here...

309
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:59,216
...until the doctors fix up her leg,
then we take her right out.

310
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,801
Two or three months and she's out,
good as new.

311
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,726
- Miss?
- Yes?

312
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,144
We want to see Mrs. Karras.

313
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,854
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yes.

314
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:16,066
- Are you a relative?
- Yes, I am her brother. He is her son.

315
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,943
Just a minute.

316
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,050
You know, it's funny.

317
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:45,345
If you wasn't a priest, you'd be famous
psychiatrist on Park Avenue.

318
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:48,974
Your mother, she'd be living in a penthouse
instead of there.

319
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:57,065
You go in, Dimmy.
I'll wait for you outside.

320
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:02,654
You'll find Mrs. Karras in the last bed
on the left-hand side.

321
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,157
No, no. No, no.

322
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:09,744
Go get someone else.
Don't bother the father.

323
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:11,579
Go to your bed. Go to your bed.

324
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,541
No, no. No, no.

325
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:18,295
The father will be back to see you.
It's all right.

326
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,223
Mama.

327
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,975
It's Dimmy, Mama.

328
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,564
Dimmy.

329
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,317
Why you did this to me, Dimmy?

330
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,110
Why?

331
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,407
Come on,
I'm gonna take you out of here, Mama.

332
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,095
I'm gonna take you home.
I'll get you out of here tonight, Mama.

333
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:55,665
Mama, everything's gonna be all right.
Mama, I'm gonna take you home.

334
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:58,835
Mama, I'm gonna take you home.

335
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:04,007
- Couldn't you have put her someplace else?
- Like what? Private hospital?

336
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,552
Who got the money for that, Dimmy?
You?

337
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:42,295
There seems to be an alien pubic hair
in my drink.

338
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:47,801
- I beg your pardon?
- Never seen it before in my life. Have you?

339
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:55,016
We're pretty comfortable up there compared
to the Gemini and Mercury programs.

340
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,393
They were tight for space.

341
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,813
You see, we got about 210 cubic feet,
so we can move around.

342
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,107
If you ever go up there again,
will you take me along?

343
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,317
Ha-ha-ha. What for?

344
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,777
First missionary on Mars.

345
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:11,241
Tell me, was it public relations you did
for the Gestapo or community relations?

346
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,993
- I'm Swiss.
- Yes, of course.

347
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:18,289
And you never went bowling with Goebbels,
either, I suppose, eh?

348
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,667
Nazi bastard.

349
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,044
Over behind the church.
You know where I mean?

350
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,630
- It's a red brick wing.
- Saint Mike's.

351
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,758
What goes on there?
Who's the priest I keep seeing there?

352
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:32,720
He's there all the time. He has black hair.
He's very intense looking. Who's that?

353
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:34,013
- Damien Karras.
- Karras?

354
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:39,436
That's his office, back of Saint Mike's.
He's our... Our psychiatric counselor.

355
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:44,023
He had a pretty rough knock last night,
poor guy. His mother passed away.

356
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:46,568
She was living by herself...

357
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:50,488
...and I guess she was dead
a couple of days before they found her.

358
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,325
Cunting Hun.

359
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:58,371
Bloody, damned, butchering Nazi pig.

360
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:01,791
Stop it! I'll kill you!

361
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,053
What's the matter with you?

362
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,889
What's for dessert?

363
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,565
You sleeping?

364
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,283
You get some sleep.

365
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:43,082
Okay. Very good. All right.

366
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:47,712
Listen, Burke, your car's at the curb.
Louie's waiting. It's nice and warm.

367
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,014
Yes, honey. What?

368
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,475
Fuck it.

369
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:10,902
- I've never seen him acting up.
- Really. Blind is what he was.

370
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:22,455
- Hi, Chris. This is a great party.
- Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.

371
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:26,793
I don't need any encouragement. My idea
of heaven is a solid white nightclub...

372
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:30,964
...with me as a headliner for all eternity,
and they love me.

373
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,301
<i>Down on the east side</i>

374
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,595
<i>Of Thoity-Thoid and Thoid</i>

375
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:43,643
<i>That's my home sweet home</i>

376
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:49,691
<i>Some people think
It's the home of black eyes</i>

377
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,693
<i>Just because...</i>

378
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,153
Hey, I think we've got a guest.

379
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:57,991
You're gonna die up there.

380
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,333
Regan?

381
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:09,252
Oh, my God, honey.

382
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:11,379
Honey, what's the matter?

383
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:12,964
- Sorry, she's sick.
- It's okay.

384
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:16,259
She didn't know what she was saying.
Come upstairs. Come on.

385
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:27,020
What made you say that, Regan?

386
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,399
Do you know, sweetheart?

387
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:38,197
Mother?

388
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:40,533
What's wrong with me?

389
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:52,879
It's just like the doctor said.
It's nerves, and that's all. Okay?

390
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,882
You just take your pills
and you'll be fine. Really.

391
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:57,592
Okay?

392
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,619
Is it coming out, Willi?

393
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,413
- Yes, I think so.
- Good.

394
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:33,002
Mother! Mother!

395
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:36,172
Mother! Mother!

396
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:40,259
Mother! Mother!

397
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:43,971
- Oh, my God!
- Make it stop!

398
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,480
- I'm gonna fold.
- Big flop.

399
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:56,526
Another five for the pair. There's
the ten with two and three of clubs.

400
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:59,987
And a six. Pair of threes still best.

401
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:05,743
- I'll talk to you about it tomorrow.
- Yeah!

402
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:10,998
Yeah.

403
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:16,060
Hey, if you get a chance,
can you take a look at it for me?

404
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,371
Where'd you get the money
for the Chivas Regal...

405
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:20,758
- ...the poor box?
- Ha.

406
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:23,678
That's an insult. I got a vow of poverty.

407
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:28,182
Where'd you get it, then?

408
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:29,809
I stole it.

409
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,479
I believe you.

410
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:37,275
College presidents shouldn't drink.
Tends to set a bad example.

411
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:40,319
I figure I saved him from
a big temptation.

412
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,740
Oh, Christ!

413
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:46,617
I should have been there. I wasn't there.
Should have been.

414
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:48,286
There was nothing you could do.

415
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,496
Lie down.

416
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,458
Give me the butt. Come on.

417
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:58,796
- Now you think you can sleep?
- Yeah.

418
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:01,924
- Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
- No.

419
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:05,720
I tell fortunes by reading the creases.
Now, shut up and go to sleep.

420
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,733
Good night.

421
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:27,283
Stealing is a sin.

422
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,331
I don't want it!

423
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:18,084
- Regan, honey, it's to help you.
- I don't want it!

424
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,545
- Hold still, honey.
- I don't want it!

425
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:22,922
You fucking bastard!

426
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:28,219
Remember also, O Lord,
thy servant, Mary Karras...

427
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:36,185
...who has gone before us with the sign of
faith and sleeps the sleep of peace.

428
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:41,649
Lord, I am not worthy to receive you.

429
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:45,570
But only say the word
and I shall be healed.

430
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:50,366
May the body of Christ bring me
to everlasting life.

431
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:08,050
Well, it's a symptom...

432
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:13,806
...of a type of disturbance in the
chemical-electrical activity of the brain.

433
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:17,977
In your daughter's case, the temporal lobe,
up here in the lateral part of the brain.

434
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,353
- Mm-hm.
- It's rare...

435
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:21,647
...but it does cause bizarre
hallucinations...

436
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:23,816
...and usually just before a convulsion.

437
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:25,067
A convulsion?

438
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:28,863
The shaking of the bed.
That's doubtless due to muscular spasms.

439
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:32,283
Oh, no, no, that was no spasm.

440
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:33,826
Look, I got on the bed.

441
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:37,663
The whole bed was thumping
and rising off the floor...

442
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:40,625
...and shaking, the whole thing,
with me on it.

443
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:43,836
Mrs. MacNeil, the problem
with your daughter is not her bed.

444
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,838
It's her brain.

445
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:54,847
So, um, ahem. What causes this?

446
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:57,183
Lesion. Lesion in the temporal lobe.

447
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:59,310
It's a kind of seizure disorder.

448
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:03,814
Look, Doc, I really don't understand how
her whole personality could change.

449
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,692
- In the temporal lobe, it's very common.
- It is?

450
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:10,237
It, uh, can last for days, even weeks.

451
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:13,699
It isn't rare to find destructive...

452
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:15,868
...even criminal behavior.

453
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:20,331
Hey, do me a favor, will you?
Tell me something good.

454
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:24,752
Don't be alarmed. if it's a lesion,
in a way, she's fortunate.

455
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,505
All we have to do is remove the scar.

456
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:45,940
- Let's move her.
- Regan, can you sit up, scoot over?

457
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:53,280
A little more.

458
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:55,408
Good.

459
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:02,289
Regan, I'm just gonna move you down
on the table, okay?

460
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:04,250
Let me do this.

461
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,252
It's okay.

462
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:10,715
See? There we go.

463
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:17,430
It's just for a short time.

464
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,110
You're doing fine.

465
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:32,319
Very sticky.

466
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:37,074
Good. Now, Regan, you're gonna feel
something a little bit cold and wet.

467
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:52,048
Okay. Now you're gonna feel
a little stick here. Don't move.

468
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:57,428
Good.

469
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:05,811
Okay. You're gonna feel
some pressure here. Now, don't move.

470
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:04,870
Hook up.

471
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,238
There's nothing there.

472
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,866
No vascular displacement at all.

473
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:44,285
Do you want me to run another series?

474
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:45,578
I don't think so.

475
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:47,329
I'd like you to see her again.

476
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:50,749
Excuse me, doctor.
Chris MacNeil is on the phone.

477
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:52,501
She says it's urgent.

478
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:55,171
- You got some time?
- Of course.

479
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:02,136
- Dr. Klein?
- Yes, I'm Dr. Klein.

480
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,929
- This is Dr. Taney.
- How do you do?

481
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:06,599
Things have gotten worse since I phoned.
Come upstairs.

482
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:09,226
- Is she having spasms again?
- They've gotten violent.

483
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:11,395
- Did you give her the medication?
- Yes.

484
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:14,106
- What was that?
- Thorazine.

485
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,150
Before that, it was Ritalin.

486
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:21,113
Chris, doctors.

487
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:23,365
- This is Dr. Taney.
- Mother, please!

488
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,284
- What is it?
- Please, make it stop!

489
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:27,745
It's burning! It's burning!

490
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:30,039
Do something, doctor. Please, help her.

491
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:35,461
Please, Mother, make it stop!
He's trying to kill me!

492
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:38,130
Mother! Mother!

493
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:44,803
All right, Regan,
let's see what the trouble...

494
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:45,971
Regan!

495
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:48,390
Keep away! The sow is mine!

496
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:53,395
Fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!

497
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:05,991
Stay away from me! Stay away!

498
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:09,620
Hold her steady. Hold her tight!

499
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,497
Don't let them!

500
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,189
She's heavily sedated.

501
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:40,359
She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.

502
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:45,823
What was going on in there?
How could she fly off the bed like that?

503
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:51,745
Pathological states can induce
abnormal strength...

504
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:54,581
...accelerated motor performance.

505
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:57,042
For example...

506
00:54:57,294 --> 00:55:01,380
...say a 90-pound woman sees her child
pinned under the wheel of a truck...

507
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:05,175
...runs out and lifts the wheels
a half a foot up off the ground.

508
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:07,803
You've heard the story. Same thing here.

509
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:11,557
Same principle, I mean.

510
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:16,020
So, what's wrong with her?

511
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,398
We still think that the temporal lobe...

512
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:22,609
Oh, what are you talking about,
for Christ's sakes?

513
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:24,820
Did you see her or not?

514
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:27,197
She's acting like she's fucking
out of her mind!

515
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:31,744
Psychotic, like a split personality, or...

516
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,664
Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry.

517
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:38,459
There haven't been more than
100 authentic cases...

518
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:42,212
...of so-called "split personality,"
Mrs. MacNeil.

519
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:47,760
Now, I know the temptation is
to leap to psychiatry...

520
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:52,598
...but any reasonable psychiatrist would
exhaust the somatic possibilities first.

521
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,519
So, what's next?

522
00:55:57,937 --> 00:56:02,107
A pneumoencephalogram,
I would think, to pin down that lesion.

523
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:04,193
It will involve another spinal.

524
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,694
Oh, Christ!

525
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:09,323
Well, what we missed in the EEG
and the arteriograms...

526
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:12,076
...could conceivably turn up there.

527
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:17,081
At least it would eliminate certain
other possibilities.

528
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:33,138
Dr. Taney says the x-rays are negative.

529
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,308
In other words, normal.

530
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,067
You keep any drugs in your house?

531
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:48,654
No, of course not. Nothing like that.

532
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,072
Are you sure?

533
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,491
Well, of course, I'm sure.

534
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:54,159
I'd tell you.

535
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:56,412
Christ, I don't even smoke grass.

536
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,836
Are you planning to be home soon?

537
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:06,088
I mean, uh, to L.A., I mean.

538
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,298
Um...

539
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:10,676
No, I, uh...

540
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:14,304
I'm building a new house.

541
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:17,099
My old one has been sold.

542
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,018
I don't know.

543
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:24,314
I was gonna take...

544
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:31,488
I was gonna take Regan to Europe
for a while after she finished school.

545
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,367
Why do you ask?

546
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:42,082
I think it's time we started looking
for a psychiatrist.

547
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:12,696
Hello?

548
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:28,712
Sharon?

549
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,458
Shit.

550
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:19,805
God.

551
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,730
Sharon!

552
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,152
What do you mean,
leaving Regan by herself?

553
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:37,248
Her window's wide open.
The room is freezing.

554
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:39,032
- Didn't he tell you?
- Who?

555
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,201
- Burke is...
- What's Burke got to do with it?

556
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:43,787
Nobody was here.
When I went to get the Thorazine...

557
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:46,331
- ...I had him stay with her, and...
- Oh.

558
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:49,167
- I should have known better. Sorry.
- I guess you should have.

559
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:50,669
How were the tests?

560
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:53,171
We have to start looking for a shrink.

561
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:54,965
Hi, Chuck. Come on in.

562
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:57,509
I suppose you heard.

563
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,344
Heard what?

564
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:03,348
You haven't heard.

565
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:06,643
Burke's dead.

566
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:13,609
He must have been drunk. He fell from
the top of the steps right outside.

567
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:16,361
By the time he hit M Street,
he broke his neck.

568
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:19,031
Oh, God.

569
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:21,783
No!

570
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:29,416
Yeah, I know.

571
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:47,559
Sharon...

572
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:48,894
Oh, my God.

573
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,691
Oh, my God.

574
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:06,078
When I touch
your forehead, open your eyes.

575
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:15,170
Are you comfortable, Regan?

576
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:19,132
Yes.

577
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:22,260
How old are you?

578
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:23,804
Twelve.

579
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,974
Is there someone inside you?

580
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:30,060
Sometimes.

581
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:32,854
Who is it?

582
01:01:33,898 --> 01:01:35,273
I don't know.

583
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:38,193
Is it Captain Howdy?

584
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:39,695
I don't know.

585
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:43,865
If I ask him to tell me,
will you let him answer?

586
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:46,326
No.

587
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:48,286
Why not?

588
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:50,831
I'm afraid.

589
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:53,583
If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you.

590
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:55,585
Do you want him to leave you?

591
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:57,421
Yes.

592
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:09,725
I'm speaking to the person
inside of Regan now.

593
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:15,105
If you are there, you, too, are hypnotized
and must answer all my questions.

594
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,316
Come forward...

595
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:22,446
...and answer me now.

596
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:34,416
Are you the person inside of Regan?

597
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:40,130
Who are you?

598
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,224
- Help me!
- Let go!

599
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:39,731
Father Karras?

600
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:44,486
Have we met?

601
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:49,407
No, we haven't met,
but they said I could tell.

602
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:52,077
That you look like a boxer.

603
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:55,497
William F. Kinderman. Homicide.

604
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:57,666
What's this all about?

605
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:01,044
It's true. You do look like a boxer.

606
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:04,339
Like John Garfield in Body and Soul.

607
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:07,217
Exactly. John Garfield.
People tell you that, Father?

608
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,263
Do people tell you
you look like Paul Newman?

609
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:12,889
Always.

610
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:22,858
Well, you know this director
who was doing the film here...

611
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:24,526
...Burke Dennings?

612
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:26,194
I've seen him.

613
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:27,863
You've seen him.

614
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:32,242
You're also familiar how last week
he died?

615
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:34,119
Only what I read in the papers.

616
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:38,957
Father, what do you know on
the subject of witchcraft?

617
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:42,460
From the witching end, not the hunting.

618
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:44,462
I once did a paper on it.

619
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:45,839
Really?

620
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:48,091
From the psychiatric end.

621
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,760
I know. I read it.

622
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:55,098
All of this desecration in the church...

623
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:58,602
...do you think this has anything to do
with witchcraft?

624
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:02,314
Maybe. Some rituals used in
the black mass, maybe.

625
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:06,985
And now Dennings.
You read how he died?

626
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:08,486
In a fall.

627
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:16,494
Let me tell you how.
And please, Father...

628
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:18,705
...confidential.

629
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:22,417
Burke Dennings, good Father...

630
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:25,503
...was found at the bottom of those steps
leading to M Street...

631
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:28,590
...with his head turned completely
around...

632
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:30,717
...facing backwards.

633
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:37,515
Didn't happen in the fall?

634
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:39,768
It's possible.

635
01:05:41,562 --> 01:05:44,522
- Possible, however...
- Unlikely.

636
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:46,149
Exactly.

637
01:05:47,568 --> 01:05:51,696
So on the one hand,
we've got a witchcraft kind of murder...

638
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:57,327
...and on the other hand, a black mass-type
desecration in the church.

639
01:05:57,495 --> 01:06:00,705
You think the killer
and the desecrator are the same?

640
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,750
Maybe somebody crazy...

641
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:06,920
...somebody with a spite against
the Church.

642
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:09,881
Some unconscious rebellion.

643
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:11,383
A sick priest, is that it?

644
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:16,221
Look, Father, this is hard for you.
Please, I understand...

645
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:19,766
...but for priests on the campus here,
you're the psychiatrist.

646
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:22,352
You'd know who was sick at the time,
who wasn't.

647
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:25,313
I mean, this kind of sickness,
you'd know that.

648
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:28,358
I don't know anyone who fits
that description.

649
01:06:29,902 --> 01:06:31,403
Ah.

650
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:35,657
Doctor's ethics.
If you knew, you wouldn't tell, huh?

651
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:36,992
No, I probably wouldn't.

652
01:06:37,618 --> 01:06:40,537
Not to bother you with trivia,
but a psychiatrist...

653
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:43,540
...in sunny California, no less...

654
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:48,169
...was put in jail for not telling the
police what he knew about a patient.

655
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:53,133
- Is that a threat?
- No, I mention it only in passing.

656
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,845
Incidentally,
I mention it only in passing...

657
01:06:57,013 --> 01:07:00,098
...I could always tell the judge it was
a matter of confession.

658
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:06,187
Hey, Father, wait a minute.

659
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:08,273
- Do you like movies?
- Very much.

660
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:11,484
Well, I get passes
to the best shows in town.

661
01:07:11,652 --> 01:07:15,613
Mrs. K, though, you know,
she gets tired, never likes to go.

662
01:07:15,781 --> 01:07:17,907
- That's too bad.
- Yeah, I hate to go alone.

663
01:07:18,075 --> 01:07:20,577
I love to talk film...

664
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:24,164
...discuss, to critique.

665
01:07:24,331 --> 01:07:29,502
You want to see a film with me?
I got passes to the Crest. It's Othello.

666
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:31,504
- Who's in it?
- Who's in it?

667
01:07:31,672 --> 01:07:35,633
Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona,
and Othello, Groucho Marx. You happy?

668
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:37,802
- I've seen it.
- Ah.

669
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:41,848
One last time. You can think
of some priest who fits the bill?

670
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:46,311
- Come on.
- No, answer the question, Father Paranoia.

671
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,148
All right. All right.

672
01:07:51,108 --> 01:07:53,651
- You know who I think really did it?
- Who?

673
01:07:53,819 --> 01:07:55,653
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.

674
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:58,907
I could have you deported,
you know that?

675
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:02,243
I lied.

676
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:05,497
You look like Sal Mineo.

677
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:13,254
It looks like a type of disorder
that's, uh, rarely ever seen anymore...

678
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:15,507
...except in primitive cultures.

679
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:20,011
We call it, uh,
somnambular-form possession.

680
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:23,348
Quite frankly, we really don't know
much about it at all...

681
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:27,852
...except that it starts with a conflict
or a guilt...

682
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:31,815
...and it leads to the patient's delusions
that his body has been invaded...

683
01:08:31,982 --> 01:08:35,819
...by some alien intelligence. Um...

684
01:08:35,986 --> 01:08:37,153
A spirit, if you will.

685
01:08:37,321 --> 01:08:40,824
Look, I'm telling you again,
and you'd better believe me...

686
01:08:40,991 --> 01:08:43,827
...I am not going to lock her up
in some goddamn asylum.

687
01:08:43,994 --> 01:08:46,663
- Well, it's out of...
- And I don't care what you call it.

688
01:08:46,831 --> 01:08:48,540
I'm not putting her away.

689
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:50,208
Well, I'm sorry.

690
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:52,210
You're sorry? Jesus Christ!

691
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:57,090
Eighty-eight doctors, and all you can
tell me with all your bullshit is...

692
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:18,736
Of course, there is one outside chance
for a cure.

693
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:25,368
But, um, I think of it
as a shock treatment.

694
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:28,329
As I said, it's a very outside chance...

695
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:31,166
Would you just name it, for God's sakes?
What is it?

696
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:33,835
- Do you have any religious beliefs?
- No.

697
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:36,421
What about your daughter?

698
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:38,381
No. Why?

699
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:40,258
Have you ever heard of exorcism?

700
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:45,430
Well, it's a stylized ritual...

701
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:52,187
...in which the, uh, rabbi or the priest try
to drive out the so-called invading spirit.

702
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:54,439
It's been pretty much discarded
these days...

703
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:59,360
...except by the Catholics, who keep it
in the closet as a sort of embarrassment.

704
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:02,614
But it, uh, has worked, in fact...

705
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:05,700
...although not for the reasons they think,
of course.

706
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:09,621
It's purely force of suggestion.

707
01:10:09,788 --> 01:10:14,584
The, uh... The victim's belief in
possession is what helped cause it...

708
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:16,377
...so in that same way...

709
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:19,797
...the belief in the power of exorcism
can make it disappear.

710
01:10:22,176 --> 01:10:26,221
You're telling me that I should
take my daughter to a witch doctor.

711
01:10:27,139 --> 01:10:28,598
Is that it?

712
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:08,948
Karl?

713
01:12:10,242 --> 01:12:12,744
Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?

714
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:17,415
She's going to be well?

715
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:23,046
Karl, if you put this in Regan's bedroom,
I want you to tell me. Now, did you?

716
01:12:23,213 --> 01:12:25,882
No, not me.

717
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:27,091
I didn't.

718
01:12:45,277 --> 01:12:48,613
This was under Regan's pillow.
Did you put it there?

719
01:12:48,989 --> 01:12:50,406
Of course, I didn't.

720
01:12:51,992 --> 01:12:53,201
I didn't put it.

721
01:12:54,995 --> 01:12:57,413
- Excuse me, madam.
- What?

722
01:12:58,457 --> 01:13:00,625
- A man to see you.
- What man?

723
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:09,592
Might your daughter remember, perhaps...

724
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,762
...if Mr. Dennings was in her room
that night?

725
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:16,140
- Why do you ask?
- Mm.

726
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:18,393
Might she remember?

727
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:23,856
No, she was heavily sedated.

728
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:25,817
It's serious?

729
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:28,277
Yes, I'm afraid it is.

730
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:32,198
- May I ask...?
- We still don't know.

731
01:13:33,158 --> 01:13:34,742
Watch out for drafts.

732
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:40,331
A draft in the fall when the house is hot
is a magic carpet for bacteria.

733
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:42,291
Excuse me, madam. Anything else?

734
01:13:42,459 --> 01:13:44,585
No, Karl, we're fine. Thank you.

735
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:46,963
It's all right, Karl.

736
01:13:51,176 --> 01:13:52,802
Why are you asking all this?

737
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:54,345
It's strange.

738
01:13:55,597 --> 01:14:00,017
The deceased comes to visit,
stays only 20 minutes...

739
01:14:00,185 --> 01:14:04,355
...and leaves all alone a very sick girl.

740
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:07,608
And speaking plainly, Mrs. MacNeil...

741
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:12,905
...it isn't likely he would fall
from a window.

742
01:14:13,532 --> 01:14:16,451
Besides, a fall wouldn't do to his neck
what we found.

743
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:19,454
Except maybe one chance in a thousand.

744
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:22,248
No. My hunch...

745
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:25,793
My opinion...

746
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:29,964
...he was killed by a very powerful man:
point one.

747
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,801
And the fracturing of
his skull: point two...

748
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:36,721
...plus the various other things
we mentioned...

749
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:40,850
...would make it very probable...

750
01:14:41,018 --> 01:14:43,811
...probable, not certain...

751
01:14:44,438 --> 01:14:50,234
...that the deceased was killed and
then pushed from your daughter's window.

752
01:14:50,402 --> 01:14:54,989
But nobody was in the room
except your daughter, so how can this be?

753
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:01,162
It could be one way.

754
01:15:01,538 --> 01:15:04,457
If someone came calling
between the time Miss Spencer left...

755
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:06,792
...and the time you returned.

756
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:09,462
Judas Priest, just a second.

757
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:13,549
- The servants? They have visitors?
- Not at all.

758
01:15:13,717 --> 01:15:16,260
You were expecting a package that day,
some delivery?

759
01:15:16,428 --> 01:15:17,637
Not that I know of.

760
01:15:17,804 --> 01:15:20,473
Groceries, cleaning, uh, a package?

761
01:15:20,641 --> 01:15:23,351
I really wouldn't know.
See, Karl takes care of all that.

762
01:15:25,437 --> 01:15:26,729
I see.

763
01:15:26,897 --> 01:15:28,856
Would you like to ask him?

764
01:15:29,733 --> 01:15:32,193
No, never mind, it's...

765
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,863
It's very remote.

766
01:15:36,573 --> 01:15:39,116
No, never mind.

767
01:15:39,618 --> 01:15:41,160
Yeah.

768
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,629
Would you like some more coffee?

769
01:15:52,297 --> 01:15:53,965
Please.

770
01:16:28,917 --> 01:16:30,334
That's cute.

771
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:33,838
Your daughter, she's the artist?

772
01:16:36,133 --> 01:16:38,175
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

773
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:40,678
Incidentally, um...

774
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:43,514
...you might ask your daughter...

775
01:16:43,682 --> 01:16:47,018
...if she remembers seeing Mr. Dennings
in her room that night.

776
01:16:47,185 --> 01:16:50,521
Look, he wouldn't have any reason
in the world to go up to her room.

777
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:53,774
Oh, I know, I realize...

778
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:57,445
...but if certain British doctors never
asked, "What is this fungus?"...

779
01:16:57,613 --> 01:17:00,823
...we wouldn't today have penicillin.
Correct?

780
01:17:01,074 --> 01:17:04,660
Well, when she's better, I'll ask her.

781
01:17:04,828 --> 01:17:07,455
- Yeah, couldn't hurt.
- Okay.

782
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:10,041
Uh, in the meantime...

783
01:17:11,543 --> 01:17:12,877
That's okay.

784
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:17,214
- I really hate to ask you this, but...
- What?

785
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:21,552
For my daughter,
could you please give an autograph?

786
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,096
Of course. Uh, where's a pencil?

787
01:17:24,264 --> 01:17:26,098
Right here. Here.

788
01:17:26,683 --> 01:17:27,975
Oh.

789
01:17:28,352 --> 01:17:29,560
She'd love it.

790
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:32,730
And what's her name?

791
01:17:35,275 --> 01:17:37,526
I lied. it's for me.

792
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:43,366
- The spelling is on the back: Kinderman.
- Okay.

793
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:46,952
You know that film you made, um, Angel?

794
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,538
- Oh, yeah.
- I saw that six times.

795
01:17:49,706 --> 01:17:51,916
- Really?
- It was beautiful.

796
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:54,877
Ha, ha. Thank you.

797
01:17:57,547 --> 01:18:00,716
You're a very nice lady.

798
01:18:02,969 --> 01:18:05,304
- Thank you.
- You're a nice man.

799
01:18:06,264 --> 01:18:09,475
Uh, I'll come back
when she's feeling better.

800
01:18:13,271 --> 01:18:15,106
- Bye.
- Bye.

801
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:37,920
Please, no!

802
01:18:38,088 --> 01:18:40,172
- Do it!
- Please, don't!

803
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:43,718
<i>You bitch! Do it! Do it!</i>

804
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:45,469
Please, no!

805
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:51,058
<i>Yes! Let Jesus fuck you!</i>

806
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:54,145
<i>Let Jesus fuck you! Let him fuck you!</i>

807
01:18:58,442 --> 01:18:59,483
Aah!

808
01:18:59,651 --> 01:19:02,486
Give it! Give it to me! Aah!

809
01:19:03,196 --> 01:19:06,657
- Ugh!
<i>- Lick me! Lick me!</i>

810
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:13,247
Chris!

811
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:17,960
Mrs. MacNeil, open the door!

812
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:26,510
Open the door!

813
01:19:26,678 --> 01:19:29,138
<i>Do you know what she did...</i>

814
01:19:29,306 --> 01:19:31,348
<i>...your cunting daughter?</i>

815
01:19:51,369 --> 01:19:52,995
Chris MacNeil?

816
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:54,371
Please, go away.

817
01:19:54,539 --> 01:19:56,624
I'm Father Karras.

818
01:19:58,543 --> 01:20:00,419
I'm very sorry. Hello.

819
01:20:00,587 --> 01:20:02,922
I should have told you
I wouldn't be in uniform.

820
01:20:03,089 --> 01:20:04,673
Yeah, that would have helped.

821
01:20:04,841 --> 01:20:07,218
- Have you got a cigarette, Father?
- Sure.

822
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:12,389
Thanks.

823
01:20:24,569 --> 01:20:25,903
Cold.

824
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:27,238
Yeah.

825
01:20:29,115 --> 01:20:30,574
Uh...

826
01:20:31,743 --> 01:20:34,203
How did a shrink ever get to be a priest?

827
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:37,331
It's the other way around. The Society
sent me through medical school.

828
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:38,624
Oh.

829
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:40,125
Where?

830
01:20:41,044 --> 01:20:44,547
Harvard, Bellevue, Johns Hopkins.

831
01:20:44,714 --> 01:20:47,091
- Places like that.
- I see.

832
01:20:48,969 --> 01:20:51,929
- You're a friend of Father Dyer's, right?
- Yes, I am.

833
01:20:52,097 --> 01:20:54,473
- Pretty close?
- Pretty close.

834
01:20:54,641 --> 01:20:56,517
Did he talk to you about my party?

835
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:58,269
He sure did.

836
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:00,354
About my daughter?

837
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:02,314
No, I didn't know you had one.

838
01:21:04,609 --> 01:21:07,152
- He didn't mention her?
- No.

839
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:08,946
Oh.

840
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:11,615
Didn't tell you what she did?

841
01:21:11,783 --> 01:21:13,659
He didn't mention her.

842
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:17,705
Priests are pretty tight-mouthed,
then, huh?

843
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:19,874
That depends.

844
01:21:20,166 --> 01:21:22,167
- On what?
- The priest.

845
01:21:22,961 --> 01:21:24,420
Sure.

846
01:21:25,922 --> 01:21:29,550
I mean, what if a person,
uh, came to you...

847
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:32,970
...you know, that was a murderer
or criminal of some kind...

848
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:36,390
...and they wanted some kind of help?

849
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:38,559
I mean, would you have to turn him in?

850
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:41,770
Well, if he came to me for
spiritual advice, I'd say no.

851
01:21:41,938 --> 01:21:43,898
- You wouldn't?
- No, I wouldn't.

852
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:46,525
But I would try to convince him
to turn himself in.

853
01:21:46,693 --> 01:21:48,152
Mm-hm.

854
01:21:48,528 --> 01:21:52,615
And, uh, how do you go about
getting an exorcism?

855
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:58,370
I beg your pardon?

856
01:22:01,833 --> 01:22:07,379
If, um... If a person's, you know,
possessed by a demon, or something...

857
01:22:07,547 --> 01:22:09,965
...how do they get an exorcism?

858
01:22:10,675 --> 01:22:14,637
I'd have to get them into a time machine
and get them back to the 16th century.

859
01:22:14,804 --> 01:22:16,472
I didn't get you.

860
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,849
It just doesn't happen anymore,
Mrs. MacNeil.

861
01:22:19,017 --> 01:22:20,726
Oh, yeah? Since when?

862
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:25,981
Well, since we learned about mental
illness, paranoia, schizophrenia.

863
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:28,108
All those things they taught me
at Harvard.

864
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:30,945
Mrs. MacNeil,
since the day I joined the Jesuits...

865
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:34,865
...I've never met one priest
who has performed an exorcism. Not one.

866
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:38,160
Yeah, well...

867
01:22:40,622 --> 01:22:44,416
...it just so happens that somebody
very close to me...

868
01:22:44,876 --> 01:22:46,543
...is probably possessed.

869
01:22:47,545 --> 01:22:49,254
And needs an exorcist.

870
01:22:49,714 --> 01:22:52,549
Father Karras, it's my little girl.

871
01:22:54,094 --> 01:22:56,345
Then that's all the more reason
to forget about exorcism.

872
01:22:56,513 --> 01:22:57,763
Why? I don't understand.

873
01:22:57,931 --> 01:23:00,641
- To begin with, it could make things worse.
- Oh, how?

874
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:03,060
Secondly, the Church,
before it approves an exorcism...

875
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:06,438
...conducts an investigation to see if
it's warranted. That takes time.

876
01:23:06,606 --> 01:23:08,246
- Yeah, but...
- Meanwhile, your daughter...

877
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:11,026
- You could do it yourself.
- No. I'd need Church approval...

878
01:23:11,194 --> 01:23:14,029
- ...and that's rarely given.
- But... Uh...

879
01:23:16,074 --> 01:23:17,658
- Could you see her?
- Yes, I could.

880
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:19,546
I could see her as a psychiatrist, but l...

881
01:23:19,703 --> 01:23:22,037
Oh, not a psychiatrist. She needs a priest.

882
01:23:22,205 --> 01:23:25,874
She's seen every fucking psychiatrist
in the world, and they sent me to you.

883
01:23:26,042 --> 01:23:27,793
Now are you gonna send me
back to them?

884
01:23:27,961 --> 01:23:30,838
- Jesus Christ, won't somebody help me?
- You don't understand...

885
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:34,091
Oh, God, can't you help her?
Just help her!

886
01:24:05,123 --> 01:24:06,874
It wants no straps.

887
01:24:22,515 --> 01:24:23,849
Hello, Regan.

888
01:24:27,437 --> 01:24:30,272
I'm a friend of your mother's.
I'd like to help you.

889
01:24:30,982 --> 01:24:33,358
You might loosen these straps, then.

890
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:36,653
I'm afraid you might hurt yourself,
Regan.

891
01:24:37,363 --> 01:24:39,490
<i>I'm not Regan.</i>

892
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:41,617
I see.

893
01:24:46,539 --> 01:24:49,458
Well, then, let's introduce ourselves.
I'm Damien Karras.

894
01:24:49,667 --> 01:24:51,251
<i>And I'm the devil.</i>

895
01:24:51,419 --> 01:24:53,337
<i>Now, kindly undo these straps.</i>

896
01:24:54,005 --> 01:24:56,590
If you're the devil,
why not make the straps disappear?

897
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:59,927
<i>That's much too vulgar a display
of power, Karras.</i>

898
01:25:01,387 --> 01:25:02,721
Where's Regan?

899
01:25:03,014 --> 01:25:04,848
<i>In here, with us.</i>

900
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:09,311
Show me Regan
and I'll loosen one of the straps.

901
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:13,107
<i>Could you help an old altar boy, Father?</i>

902
01:25:14,067 --> 01:25:16,443
<i>Your mother's in here with us, Karras.</i>

903
01:25:16,611 --> 01:25:18,695
<i>Would you like to leave a message?</i>

904
01:25:18,863 --> 01:25:21,115
I'll see that she gets it.

905
01:25:26,496 --> 01:25:28,038
If that's true...

906
01:25:30,583 --> 01:25:33,460
...then you must know my mother's
maiden name.

907
01:25:35,046 --> 01:25:43,046
What is it?

908
01:26:39,944 --> 01:26:41,445
Thank you.

909
01:26:43,948 --> 01:26:48,785
Look, I'm only against the possibility of
doing your daughter more harm than good.

910
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:52,289
Nothing you could do
could make it any worse.

911
01:26:52,832 --> 01:26:54,499
I can't do it.

912
01:26:55,126 --> 01:26:57,252
I need evidence that the Church
would accept...

913
01:26:57,420 --> 01:26:59,296
- ...as signs of possession.
- Like what?

914
01:26:59,464 --> 01:27:01,882
Speaking in a language
she's never known or studied.

915
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:03,383
What else?

916
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:07,971
I don't know. I'd have to look it up.

917
01:27:08,139 --> 01:27:10,515
I thought you were supposed
to be an expert.

918
01:27:11,392 --> 01:27:13,310
There are no experts.

919
01:27:14,145 --> 01:27:17,606
You probably know as much about
possession as most priests.

920
01:27:18,191 --> 01:27:20,484
Look, your daughter doesn't say
she's a demon.

921
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:23,028
She says she's the devil himself.

922
01:27:23,196 --> 01:27:25,322
If you've seen as many psychotics
as I have...

923
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:29,159
...you'd realize that's the same thing
as saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte.

924
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:34,957
You asked me what I think is best
for your daughter.

925
01:27:35,833 --> 01:27:41,588
Six months under observation
in the best hospital you can find.

926
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:46,301
You show me Regan's double...

927
01:27:46,469 --> 01:27:50,555
...same face, same voice, everything...

928
01:27:50,723 --> 01:27:52,766
...and I'd know it wasn't Regan.

929
01:27:53,685 --> 01:27:55,269
I'd know in my gut.

930
01:27:56,688 --> 01:28:00,274
I'm telling you that that thing upstairs
isn't my daughter.

931
01:28:00,984 --> 01:28:03,402
I want you to tell me that you know
for a fact...

932
01:28:03,569 --> 01:28:06,655
...that there's nothing wrong
with my daughter except in her mind.

933
01:28:06,823 --> 01:28:09,866
Tell me you know for a fact
that an exorcism wouldn't do any good.

934
01:28:10,034 --> 01:28:11,994
You tell me that!

935
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:26,425
Did Regan know a priest was
coming over?

936
01:28:27,885 --> 01:28:31,013
- No.
- Did you know my mother died recently?

937
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:34,224
- Yes, I did. I'm very sorry.
- No.

938
01:28:34,892 --> 01:28:36,560
Is Regan aware of it?

939
01:28:37,937 --> 01:28:39,229
Not at all.

940
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:42,065
Why do you ask?

941
01:28:43,901 --> 01:28:45,902
It's not important. Good night.

942
01:29:12,555 --> 01:29:14,556
Hello?

943
01:29:16,934 --> 01:29:21,229
- Here, take it and just don't...
- Okay. Um.

944
01:29:21,397 --> 01:29:22,856
<i>Hello, Daddy?</i>

945
01:29:23,024 --> 01:29:24,608
<i>This is me.</i>

946
01:29:25,401 --> 01:29:28,528
<i>- What should I say? I don't know.
- Just talk to your daddy.</i>

947
01:29:28,696 --> 01:29:31,031
<i>- Anything you want.
- All right, um...</i>

948
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:35,911
<i>Tell him what you've been doing
and how you're feeling and like that.</i>

949
01:29:37,413 --> 01:29:38,663
<i>Uh...</i>

950
01:29:38,831 --> 01:29:41,291
<i>Well, you see, um...</i>

951
01:29:41,709 --> 01:29:44,795
<i>I mean, I hope you can hear me.
Can you hear me okay?</i>

952
01:29:44,962 --> 01:29:47,162
<i>- Well, uh, let me see.
- He's not gonna answer you.</i>

953
01:29:47,298 --> 01:29:49,383
<i>Uh, ha-ha-ha.</i>

954
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:51,885
<i>- Go on. Talk to your daddy, honey.
- Um...</i>

955
01:29:52,053 --> 01:29:54,388
<i>I don't know what to say, though. Um...</i>

956
01:29:54,847 --> 01:29:58,141
<i>Well, let's see. First we... No.</i>

957
01:29:58,518 --> 01:30:01,645
<i>- Wait. I don't know.
- Come on, Regan.</i>

958
01:30:01,813 --> 01:30:03,814
<i>- Tell him about Washington.
- Okay.</i>

959
01:30:03,981 --> 01:30:06,817
<i>See, we're in Washington now,
Daddy, and...</i>

960
01:30:09,112 --> 01:30:12,697
He broke the bread,
gave it to his disciples and said:

961
01:30:15,493 --> 01:30:18,036
"Take this, all of you, and eat it..."

962
01:30:21,874 --> 01:30:23,166
"...for this is my body."

963
01:30:29,882 --> 01:30:32,801
When the supper was ended,
he took the cup.

964
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:36,221
Again he gave you thanks and praise.

965
01:30:36,848 --> 01:30:40,225
He gave the cup to his disciples and said,
"Take this..."

966
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,936
"...all of you, and drink from it."

967
01:30:46,315 --> 01:30:48,900
"This is the cup of my blood."

968
01:30:50,403 --> 01:30:54,489
"The blood of the new and everlasting
covenant, the mystery of faith."

969
01:30:55,783 --> 01:30:58,201
<i>What an excellent day for an exorcism.</i>

970
01:31:00,371 --> 01:31:01,580
You'd like that?

971
01:31:01,747 --> 01:31:03,665
<i>Intensely.</i>

972
01:31:04,542 --> 01:31:06,918
But wouldn't that drive you
out of Regan?

973
01:31:07,086 --> 01:31:09,337
<i>It would bring us together.</i>

974
01:31:10,715 --> 01:31:11,923
You and Regan?

975
01:31:12,091 --> 01:31:13,800
<i>You and us.</i>

976
01:31:25,062 --> 01:31:28,982
- Did you do that?
- Uh-huh.

977
01:31:33,905 --> 01:31:35,906
- Do it again.
<i>- In time.</i>

978
01:31:36,073 --> 01:31:37,657
No, now.

979
01:31:37,825 --> 01:31:39,576
<i>In time.</i>

980
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:43,997
<i>Mirabile dictu, don't you agree?</i>

981
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:46,750
You speak Latin?

982
01:31:47,774 --> 01:31:49,774
<i>Ego te absolvo.</i>

983
01:31:50,798 --> 01:31:52,298
Quod nomen mihi est?

984
01:31:52,322 --> 01:31:54,322
<i>Bonjour!</i>

985
01:31:54,346 --> 01:31:55,946
Quod nomen mihi est?

986
01:31:56,070 --> 01:31:57,719
<i>La plume de ma tante.</i>

987
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:00,013
How long are you planning
to stay in Regan?

988
01:32:00,556 --> 01:32:03,058
<i>Until she rots and lies stinking
in the earth.</i>

989
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:07,312
<i>What's that?</i>

990
01:32:07,855 --> 01:32:09,523
Holy water.

991
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:12,442
<i>You keep it away.</i>

992
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:17,781
<i>It burns!</i>

993
01:32:17,949 --> 01:32:20,450
<i>Oh, it burns!</i>

994
01:32:42,199 --> 01:32:43,199
<i>No one.</i>

995
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:44,558
Who are you?

996
01:32:44,582 --> 01:32:45,582
<i>No one!</i>

997
01:32:56,946 --> 01:33:00,115
You know, I'm, like, in seclusion.

998
01:33:03,828 --> 01:33:06,288
No, I'm just exhausted from work.

999
01:33:08,624 --> 01:33:10,041
Um...

1000
01:33:10,501 --> 01:33:12,836
She's... She's all right.

1001
01:33:13,004 --> 01:33:14,879
She's just a little...

1002
01:33:17,675 --> 01:33:19,467
I don't want to talk about it, okay?

1003
01:33:22,346 --> 01:33:24,139
Um...

1004
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:28,685
Okay, I'll talk to you. I'll call you
as soon as it's over, all right?

1005
01:33:30,021 --> 01:33:32,397
No, I just... I'm really...
I'm going through something...

1006
01:33:32,565 --> 01:33:34,482
...and I just have to, uh...

1007
01:33:35,526 --> 01:33:37,193
No, no. No, no.

1008
01:33:37,445 --> 01:33:39,321
There's nothing.

1009
01:33:40,114 --> 01:33:41,781
Hey, thanks a lot.

1010
01:33:42,533 --> 01:33:44,034
Bye, now.

1011
01:33:58,090 --> 01:34:00,342
- Want a drink?
- Please.

1012
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:02,385
What do you drink?

1013
01:34:02,553 --> 01:34:04,137
Uh, Scotch.

1014
01:34:05,556 --> 01:34:08,850
- Ice, water.
- Okay.

1015
01:34:14,523 --> 01:34:16,691
No ice. I'll get some from the kitchen.

1016
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:18,501
- No, I'll take it straight.
- It's fine.

1017
01:34:18,569 --> 01:34:19,569
No, please, sit.

1018
01:34:19,737 --> 01:34:21,696
- Really? You sure?
- Yeah, sit.

1019
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:34,876
Where's her father?

1020
01:34:35,044 --> 01:34:36,252
In Europe.

1021
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:38,254
- Have you told him what's happening?
- No.

1022
01:34:38,422 --> 01:34:40,715
Well, I think you should.

1023
01:34:48,307 --> 01:34:53,603
I told Regan that was holy water. I sprinkled
it on her and she reacted very violently.

1024
01:34:55,523 --> 01:34:56,773
It's tap water.

1025
01:34:56,941 --> 01:34:58,024
What's the difference?

1026
01:34:58,192 --> 01:35:02,946
Holy water's blessed. And that doesn't
help support a case for possession.

1027
01:35:13,416 --> 01:35:16,876
She killed Burke Dennings.

1028
01:35:17,044 --> 01:35:18,253
What?

1029
01:35:21,966 --> 01:35:24,008
She killed Burke Dennings.

1030
01:35:25,636 --> 01:35:28,471
She pushed him out her window.

1031
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:43,236
<i>Who are you?</i>

1032
01:35:46,407 --> 01:35:48,867
It's a language, all right. It's English.

1033
01:35:50,327 --> 01:35:51,453
What do you mean?

1034
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:53,830
It's English in reverse. Listen.

1035
01:35:54,498 --> 01:35:56,249
<i>Give us time.</i>

1036
01:35:56,417 --> 01:35:58,376
<i>Let her die.</i>

1037
01:36:01,338 --> 01:36:03,923
<i>I am no one. I am no one.</i>

1038
01:36:04,091 --> 01:36:05,383
<i>Fear the priest.</i>

1039
01:36:07,386 --> 01:36:09,053
<i>Fear the priest.</i>

1040
01:36:11,766 --> 01:36:13,183
<i>Merrin!</i>

1041
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:23,026
<i>I am no one.</i>

1042
01:36:25,404 --> 01:36:26,863
<i>Merrin! Fear the priest.</i>

1043
01:36:28,908 --> 01:36:34,037
<i>Merrin!</i>

1044
01:36:34,622 --> 01:36:38,917
Yeah?

1045
01:36:40,169 --> 01:36:41,211
I'll be right there.

1046
01:36:59,730 --> 01:37:01,481
I don't want Chris to see this.

1047
01:37:01,649 --> 01:37:04,192
- Well, what's wrong? What is it?
- Shh.

1048
01:38:13,012 --> 01:38:15,346
You're convinced that it's genuine?

1049
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:17,307
I don't know.

1050
01:38:18,475 --> 01:38:20,768
No, not really, I suppose.

1051
01:38:21,270 --> 01:38:23,313
But I have made...

1052
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:27,859
...a prudent judgment that it meets
the conditions set down in The Ritual.

1053
01:38:28,068 --> 01:38:30,528
You would want to do the exorcism
yourself?

1054
01:38:31,822 --> 01:38:33,072
Yes.

1055
01:38:36,869 --> 01:38:38,870
Might be best to have a man
with experience.

1056
01:38:39,038 --> 01:38:42,332
Maybe someone who's spent time
in foreign missions.

1057
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,959
I understand, Your Excellency.

1058
01:38:45,419 --> 01:38:46,669
Let's see who's around.

1059
01:38:46,837 --> 01:38:50,006
In the meantime,
I'll call you as soon as I know.

1060
01:38:50,841 --> 01:38:53,134
Thank you, Your Excellency.

1061
01:38:53,510 --> 01:38:55,595
Well, he does know the background.

1062
01:38:55,763 --> 01:38:59,223
I doubt there's any danger in just
having him assist.

1063
01:38:59,391 --> 01:39:02,101
There should be a psychiatrist present,
anyway.

1064
01:39:02,269 --> 01:39:04,062
What about the exorcist?

1065
01:39:04,355 --> 01:39:05,772
Have you any ideas?

1066
01:39:06,815 --> 01:39:08,858
How about Lankester Merrin?

1067
01:39:09,318 --> 01:39:10,860
Merrin?

1068
01:39:11,153 --> 01:39:12,654
I had a notion he was in Iraq.

1069
01:39:12,821 --> 01:39:15,031
I read he was working on a dig
near Nineveh.

1070
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:16,699
You're right, but he's finished.

1071
01:39:16,867 --> 01:39:20,370
He came back three or four months ago.
He's at Woodstock now.

1072
01:39:20,537 --> 01:39:22,205
What's he doing there, teaching?

1073
01:39:22,373 --> 01:39:24,958
He's working on another book.

1074
01:39:25,125 --> 01:39:29,003
Don't you think he's too old, Tom?
How's his health?

1075
01:39:29,338 --> 01:39:32,882
He must be all right.
He's still running around digging up tombs.

1076
01:39:33,509 --> 01:39:34,592
Mm.

1077
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:38,304
- Besides, he's had experience.
- I didn't know that.

1078
01:39:38,514 --> 01:39:40,723
Ten, 12 years ago, I think, in Africa.

1079
01:39:40,891 --> 01:39:44,811
The exorcism supposedly lasted months.
I heard it damn near killed him.

1080
01:39:49,233 --> 01:39:50,608
Father?

1081
01:40:57,384 --> 01:40:59,469
- You're Mrs. MacNeil?
- Yes.

1082
01:40:59,636 --> 01:41:01,012
I'm Father Merrin.

1083
01:41:01,221 --> 01:41:03,514
- Come in.
- Thank you.

1084
01:41:04,099 --> 01:41:05,641
- Is Father Karras here?
- Yes.

1085
01:41:05,809 --> 01:41:07,852
- He's here already.
- Father?

1086
01:41:08,479 --> 01:41:11,481
- Father Karras.
- It's an honor to meet you, Father.

1087
01:41:17,988 --> 01:41:20,073
- Are you very tired?
- No.

1088
01:41:21,325 --> 01:41:24,327
I'd like you to go quickly across
to the Residence, Damien...

1089
01:41:24,495 --> 01:41:26,329
...and gather up a cassock for myself...

1090
01:41:26,497 --> 01:41:30,458
...two surplices, a purple stole,
and some holy water...

1091
01:41:30,626 --> 01:41:32,168
...and, um...

1092
01:41:32,503 --> 01:41:35,463
...your copy of The Roman Ritual.
The large one.

1093
01:41:35,631 --> 01:41:37,340
I believe we should begin.

1094
01:41:37,841 --> 01:41:40,259
Do you want to hear the background
of the case first?

1095
01:41:40,427 --> 01:41:41,677
Why?

1096
01:41:42,179 --> 01:41:44,347
This is yours to do with as you please.

1097
01:41:44,515 --> 01:41:48,101
You can choose to escape, if you want,
but you may never be able to return.

1098
01:41:48,268 --> 01:41:50,103
Don't let anyone decide for you.

1099
01:42:03,075 --> 01:42:05,701
Hail Mary, full of grace...

1100
01:42:18,590 --> 01:42:20,716
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.

1101
01:42:22,970 --> 01:42:24,554
Thank you very much.

1102
01:42:24,721 --> 01:42:26,139
You're welcome.

1103
01:42:36,441 --> 01:42:38,734
Would you like some brandy in that,
Father?

1104
01:42:40,779 --> 01:42:43,072
Well, the doctors say I shouldn't.

1105
01:42:43,740 --> 01:42:45,241
But thank God...

1106
01:42:45,409 --> 01:42:47,535
...my will is weak.

1107
01:42:56,420 --> 01:43:01,382
<i>Especially important is the warning
to avoid conversations with the demon.</i>

1108
01:43:01,550 --> 01:43:05,928
We may ask what is relevant,
but anything beyond that is dangerous.

1109
01:43:06,096 --> 01:43:08,222
He's a liar. The demon is a liar.

1110
01:43:08,599 --> 01:43:10,766
He will lie to confuse us.

1111
01:43:11,894 --> 01:43:15,980
But he will also mix lies with the truth...

1112
01:43:16,607 --> 01:43:17,940
...to attack us.

1113
01:43:19,026 --> 01:43:21,694
<i>The attack is psychological, Damien.</i>

1114
01:43:22,654 --> 01:43:24,113
<i>And powerful.</i>

1115
01:43:24,948 --> 01:43:26,449
<i>So don't listen.</i>

1116
01:43:26,617 --> 01:43:29,702
<i>Remember that. Do not listen.</i>

1117
01:43:31,413 --> 01:43:33,789
It might be helpful
if I gave you some background...

1118
01:43:33,957 --> 01:43:36,500
...on the different personalities Regan
has manifested.

1119
01:43:36,668 --> 01:43:38,544
So far, I'd say there seem to be three.

1120
01:43:39,087 --> 01:43:41,339
- She's convinced that she's...
- There is only one.

1121
01:44:04,988 --> 01:44:08,366
What is your daughter's middle name,
Mrs. MacNeil?

1122
01:44:08,659 --> 01:44:10,159
Teresa.

1123
01:44:13,205 --> 01:44:15,248
What a lovely name.

1124
01:44:51,243 --> 01:44:53,119
<i>Stick your cock up her ass...</i>

1125
01:44:53,287 --> 01:44:56,038
<i>...you motherfucking
worthless cocksucker.</i>

1126
01:44:56,206 --> 01:44:58,958
- Be silent!
- Aah!

1127
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:12,722
Our Father, who art in heaven...

1128
01:45:14,141 --> 01:45:15,558
...hallowed be thy name.

1129
01:45:15,726 --> 01:45:17,435
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done...

1130
01:45:17,644 --> 01:45:19,687
...on earth as it is in heaven.

1131
01:45:19,855 --> 01:45:22,398
Give us this day our daily bread.

1132
01:45:22,983 --> 01:45:25,526
Forgive us our trespasses...

1133
01:45:25,694 --> 01:45:28,404
...as we forgive those who trespass
against us.

1134
01:45:28,572 --> 01:45:30,781
And lead us not into temptation.

1135
01:45:30,949 --> 01:45:32,491
But deliver us from the evil one.

1136
01:45:32,701 --> 01:45:36,412
Save me, O God, by thy name.
By thy might, defend my cause.

1137
01:45:38,248 --> 01:45:43,169
Proud men have risen up against me,
and men of violence seek my life...

1138
01:45:43,337 --> 01:45:47,882
...but God is my helper
and the Lord sustains my life.

1139
01:45:48,050 --> 01:45:49,717
In every need, he has delivered me.

1140
01:45:49,885 --> 01:45:52,553
Glory be to the Father,
to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.

1141
01:45:52,721 --> 01:45:55,765
As it was in the beginning,
is now and shall be, world without end.

1142
01:45:55,932 --> 01:45:59,101
- Save your servant.
- Who places her trust in thee, my God.

1143
01:45:59,269 --> 01:46:02,897
- Be unto her, O Lord, a fortified tower.
- In the face of the enemy...

1144
01:46:04,274 --> 01:46:07,735
- Let the enemy have no power over her.
- Son of Iniquity be powerless to harm her.

1145
01:46:07,903 --> 01:46:11,739
<i>Your mother sucks cocks in hell, Karras.
You faithless slime.</i>

1146
01:46:11,907 --> 01:46:12,948
The Lord be with you.

1147
01:46:13,116 --> 01:46:15,117
- And also with you.
- Let us pray.

1148
01:46:15,285 --> 01:46:16,619
Holy Lord, almighty Father...

1149
01:46:17,954 --> 01:46:18,996
...everlasting God...

1150
01:46:19,164 --> 01:46:21,707
...and Father of our Lord, Jesus Christ...

1151
01:46:21,875 --> 01:46:25,753
...who, once and for all, consigned
that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell...

1152
01:46:25,921 --> 01:46:30,466
...who sent your only begotten son into
the world to crush that roaring lion...

1153
01:46:31,093 --> 01:46:32,968
...hasten to our call for help...

1154
01:46:33,136 --> 01:46:38,015
...and snatch from ruination and
from the clutches of the noonday devil...

1155
01:46:38,183 --> 01:46:42,395
...this human being,
made in your image and likeness.

1156
01:46:42,562 --> 01:46:47,566
Strike terror, Lord, into the beast
now laying waste to your vineyard.

1157
01:46:47,734 --> 01:46:52,530
Let your mighty hand cast him out
of your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil...

1158
01:46:53,949 --> 01:46:56,909
...so he may no longer hold captive
this person...

1159
01:46:57,119 --> 01:46:59,662
...whom it pleased you to make
in your image...

1160
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:00,830
Aah!

1161
01:47:00,997 --> 01:47:04,708
...and to redeem through your son,
who lives and reigns with you...

1162
01:47:04,918 --> 01:47:09,338
...in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.

1163
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:11,882
- Amen.
- O Lord, hear my prayer.

1164
01:47:14,803 --> 01:47:16,387
Father Karras.

1165
01:47:18,765 --> 01:47:20,516
Father Karras.

1166
01:47:22,310 --> 01:47:25,855
Damien. The response, please, Damien!

1167
01:47:26,690 --> 01:47:29,024
And let my cry come unto thee.

1168
01:47:29,192 --> 01:47:33,237
Almighty Lord, word of God the Father,
Jesus Christ...

1169
01:47:33,405 --> 01:47:35,865
...God and Lord of all creation...

1170
01:47:37,242 --> 01:47:38,962
...who gave to your holy apostles...

1171
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:42,204
...the power to tramp underfoot
serpents and scorpions.

1172
01:47:42,372 --> 01:47:44,290
Grant me...

1173
01:47:44,458 --> 01:47:46,208
...your unworthy servant...

1174
01:47:46,376 --> 01:47:48,252
- ...pardon for all my sins...
- Bastards!

1175
01:47:48,420 --> 01:47:53,048
...and the power to confront
this cruel demon.

1176
01:48:09,733 --> 01:48:14,111
See the cross of the Lord.
Be gone, you hostile power.

1177
01:48:14,321 --> 01:48:17,239
- O Lord, hear my prayer.
- And let my cry come unto thee.

1178
01:48:17,574 --> 01:48:20,409
- The Lord be with you.
- And also with you.

1179
01:48:50,899 --> 01:48:52,274
Father.

1180
01:49:14,214 --> 01:49:17,466
I cast you out, unclean spirit!

1181
01:49:17,634 --> 01:49:20,761
<i>- Shove it up your ass, you faggot!</i>
- In the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ!

1182
01:49:22,931 --> 01:49:25,099
It is he who commands you!

1183
01:49:25,308 --> 01:49:28,727
He who flung you straight from heaven
to the depths of hell!

1184
01:49:28,937 --> 01:49:30,187
<i>- Fuck him!</i>
- Be gone...

1185
01:49:30,355 --> 01:49:33,315
<i>- Fuck him, Karras!</i>
- ...from this creature of God.

1186
01:49:36,152 --> 01:49:37,361
Be gone!

1187
01:49:37,529 --> 01:49:41,657
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son...

1188
01:49:41,825 --> 01:49:43,659
...and the Holy Spirit.

1189
01:49:43,827 --> 01:49:48,289
By this sign of the Holy Cross,
of our Lord Jesus Christ...

1190
01:49:48,456 --> 01:49:52,543
...who lives and reigns with the Father
and the Holy Spirit.

1191
01:49:54,254 --> 01:49:55,629
Damien!

1192
01:49:56,298 --> 01:49:57,423
Amen.

1193
01:49:57,632 --> 01:50:00,676
God, defender of the human race...

1194
01:50:02,887 --> 01:50:04,179
...look down in pity...

1195
01:50:04,347 --> 01:50:07,349
<i>You killed your mother!
You left her alone to die!</i>

1196
01:50:07,517 --> 01:50:09,643
- Shut up!
<i>- She'll never forgive you!</i>

1197
01:50:09,811 --> 01:50:11,937
- Shut up!
- Bastard!

1198
01:50:13,523 --> 01:50:15,065
I command you...

1199
01:50:15,483 --> 01:50:18,277
...by the judge of the living
and the dead...

1200
01:50:18,445 --> 01:50:22,031
...to depart from this servant of God.

1201
01:50:24,701 --> 01:50:26,994
It's the power... Holy water.

1202
01:50:31,791 --> 01:50:35,294
It's the power of Christ that compels you.

1203
01:50:35,754 --> 01:50:43,754
- The power of Christ compels you!
- The power of Christ compels you!

1204
01:51:22,926 --> 01:51:26,303
- The power of Christ compels you.
- The power of Christ compels you.

1205
01:51:26,471 --> 01:51:29,807
He brought you low
by his blood-stained cross!

1206
01:51:29,974 --> 01:51:33,602
Do not despise my command,
because you know me to be a sinner.

1207
01:51:37,899 --> 01:51:41,110
It is God himself who commands you.

1208
01:51:44,072 --> 01:51:47,574
The majestic Christ who commands you.

1209
01:51:48,868 --> 01:51:50,786
God, the Father, commands you.

1210
01:51:54,207 --> 01:51:56,542
God, the Son, commands you.

1211
01:52:00,422 --> 01:52:03,173
God, the Holy Spirit, commands you.

1212
01:52:03,341 --> 01:52:05,509
The mystery of the cross commands you.

1213
01:52:05,677 --> 01:52:08,512
The blood of the martyrs commands you.

1214
01:52:28,658 --> 01:52:32,661
Give way to Christ, you
prince of murderers.

1215
01:52:33,955 --> 01:52:37,291
You're guilty before almighty God.

1216
01:52:37,917 --> 01:52:40,419
Guilty before his son.

1217
01:52:40,587 --> 01:52:43,672
Guilty before the whole human race.

1218
01:52:44,007 --> 01:52:46,341
It is the Lord who expels you...

1219
01:52:46,509 --> 01:52:52,097
...he who is coming to judge both the
living and the dead and the world, by fire.

1220
01:53:14,120 --> 01:53:15,704
Are you tired?

1221
01:53:23,129 --> 01:53:25,923
Let's rest before we start again.

1222
01:54:01,167 --> 01:54:04,920
Why this girl? It doesn't make sense.

1223
01:54:13,429 --> 01:54:16,557
I think the point is to make us despair.

1224
01:54:19,602 --> 01:54:21,770
To see ourselves as...

1225
01:54:23,273 --> 01:54:25,524
...animal and ugly.

1226
01:54:28,862 --> 01:54:32,865
To reject the possibility that God
could love us.

1227
01:54:40,415 --> 01:54:42,749
Will you excuse me, Damien?

1228
01:55:34,677 --> 01:55:39,014
Why? Why?

1229
01:55:40,683 --> 01:55:44,645
No. No.

1230
01:56:10,380 --> 01:56:13,757
<i>Dimmy, why you do this to me?</i>

1231
01:56:16,219 --> 01:56:19,680
<i>Please, Dimmy. I'm afraid.</i>

1232
01:56:21,224 --> 01:56:23,308
You're not my mother.

1233
01:56:24,268 --> 01:56:26,478
<i>Dimmy, please!</i>

1234
01:56:39,575 --> 01:56:41,243
What is it?

1235
01:56:46,290 --> 01:56:47,374
Her heart.

1236
01:56:47,917 --> 01:56:49,793
Can you give her something?

1237
01:56:49,961 --> 01:56:51,795
She'll go into a coma.

1238
01:56:55,758 --> 01:56:57,926
You're not my mother!

1239
01:56:58,094 --> 01:56:59,094
Don't listen.

1240
01:56:59,262 --> 01:57:00,887
<i>Why, Dimmy?</i>

1241
01:57:01,848 --> 01:57:03,181
Damien.

1242
01:57:03,349 --> 01:57:04,599
<i>- Dimmy, please.</i>
- Damien.

1243
01:57:09,022 --> 01:57:10,772
Get out.

1244
01:59:04,095 --> 01:59:08,306
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

1245
01:59:23,865 --> 01:59:25,699
Is it over?

1246
01:59:26,242 --> 01:59:27,826
Mm-mm.

1247
01:59:35,751 --> 01:59:37,544
Is she gonna die?

1248
01:59:42,884 --> 01:59:44,259
No.

1249
02:01:02,171 --> 02:01:04,130
You son of a bitch!

1250
02:01:10,096 --> 02:01:12,013
Take me.

1251
02:01:12,181 --> 02:01:13,473
Come into me.

1252
02:01:13,683 --> 02:01:16,685
Goddamn you, take me!

1253
02:01:17,353 --> 02:01:18,979
Take me!

1254
02:01:32,201 --> 02:01:33,660
No!

1255
02:01:43,254 --> 02:01:44,296
Mother.

1256
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:49,050
Mother.

1257
02:01:54,515 --> 02:01:57,350
Mother.

1258
02:02:00,021 --> 02:02:01,229
Did somebody fall?

1259
02:02:01,397 --> 02:02:02,856
- The steps!
- Help!

1260
02:02:03,024 --> 02:02:04,733
Mother!

1261
02:02:06,610 --> 02:02:07,652
Mother!

1262
02:02:09,488 --> 02:02:10,530
Rags?

1263
02:02:31,927 --> 02:02:34,346
Do you want to make your confession?

1264
02:02:40,227 --> 02:02:42,270
Are you sorry for...?

1265
02:02:42,438 --> 02:02:47,067
Are you sorry for having offended God
and for all the sins of your past life?

1266
02:02:53,532 --> 02:02:55,669
<i>"Ego te absolvo in
nomine Patris..."</i>

1267
02:02:57,020 --> 02:03:01,062
<i>"...nomine Patris et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti. Amen."</i>

1268
02:03:16,263 --> 02:03:17,680
- Where do you want this?
- What?

1269
02:03:17,848 --> 02:03:19,099
Phonograph.

1270
02:03:19,266 --> 02:03:20,475
Storage.

1271
02:03:29,985 --> 02:03:31,403
That's everything.

1272
02:03:33,489 --> 02:03:35,198
I'm gonna miss you.

1273
02:03:35,366 --> 02:03:36,741
Same here.

1274
02:03:37,284 --> 02:03:38,952
Sure you won't change your mind?

1275
02:03:54,802 --> 02:03:57,345
I found this in her room.

1276
02:04:02,017 --> 02:04:03,852
You better hurry.

1277
02:04:13,612 --> 02:04:15,447
Come on, honey, we have to get going.

1278
02:04:39,513 --> 02:04:41,306
She doesn't remember any of it.

1279
02:04:41,891 --> 02:04:43,558
That's good.

1280
02:04:47,396 --> 02:04:48,980
- All done.
- Okay.

1281
02:04:49,148 --> 02:04:50,690
Honey, this is Father Dyer.

1282
02:04:50,858 --> 02:04:53,067
- Hi, Father.
- Hello.

1283
02:04:53,944 --> 02:04:55,028
Ready, missus.

1284
02:04:56,989 --> 02:04:58,406
- Goodbye, Father.
- Goodbye.

1285
02:04:58,574 --> 02:04:59,991
I'll call you.

1286
02:05:20,804 --> 02:05:22,388
Bye.

1287
02:05:26,727 --> 02:05:28,478
- Bye, Father.
- I hope I see you again.

1288
02:05:28,646 --> 02:05:30,146
I hope so too.

1289
02:05:30,731 --> 02:05:32,607
Father Dyer?

1290
02:05:37,279 --> 02:05:39,781
I thought you'd like to keep this.

1291
02:05:48,916 --> 02:05:50,500
Why don't you keep it?

1292
02:06:55,065 --> 02:06:56,316
Lieutenant.

1293
02:06:57,359 --> 02:06:58,860
You just missed them.

1294
02:07:02,156 --> 02:07:03,656
How's the girl?

1295
02:07:04,575 --> 02:07:06,200
She seemed fine.

1296
02:07:06,910 --> 02:07:12,248
That's important.

1297
02:07:13,375 --> 02:07:15,501
Well, well...

1298
02:07:15,669 --> 02:07:18,046
...back to business, back to work.

1299
02:07:18,756 --> 02:07:21,424
- Goodbye, Father.
- Goodbye.

1300
02:07:26,138 --> 02:07:27,388
Father Dyer...

1301
02:07:29,558 --> 02:07:31,351
...do you go to films?

1302
02:07:31,518 --> 02:07:32,560
Sure.

1303
02:07:32,853 --> 02:07:35,938
Well, I got passes.

1304
02:07:36,106 --> 02:07:38,441
In fact, I got a pass to the Crest
tomorrow night.

1305
02:07:38,609 --> 02:07:39,734
Would you like to go?

1306
02:07:39,902 --> 02:07:42,654
- What's playing?
- Wuthering Heights.

1307
02:07:42,821 --> 02:07:44,322
Who's in it?

1308
02:07:45,115 --> 02:07:51,204
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role
of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.

1309
02:07:52,706 --> 02:07:54,248
I've seen it.

1310
02:07:58,629 --> 02:08:00,088
Another one.

1311
02:08:00,923 --> 02:08:03,424
- Had your lunch?
- No.
