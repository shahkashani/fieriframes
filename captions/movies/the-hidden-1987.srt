1
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:51,780
Drop it!

2
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,501
Freeze!

3
00:02:28,086 --> 00:02:29,485
Get down behind something.

4
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,782
Somebody get the police!

5
00:02:30,822 --> 00:02:32,517
Get down! Go!

6
00:02:53,177 --> 00:02:56,146
He went that way
in a black Ferrari. Go!

7
00:03:15,433 --> 00:03:17,162
Suspect is heading..

8
00:03:18,369 --> 00:03:20,200
Look out!

9
00:03:54,872 --> 00:03:57,204
Now in pursuit.
Wilshire at Parkview..

10
00:04:09,454 --> 00:04:11,217
Suspect is currently..

11
00:04:51,596 --> 00:04:53,587
Stop! Oh, my God!

12
00:04:56,367 --> 00:04:57,891
Yeah, that's him, all right.

13
00:04:58,102 --> 00:04:59,228
That's Jack.

14
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,237
Real nice man.

15
00:05:00,271 --> 00:05:01,829
Kind of quiet.
Real gentleman.

16
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:04,837
When was the last time
you saw him?

17
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:08,409
Oh, I haven't seen him in..
about a week.

18
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,815
What did he do, rob a bank?

19
00:05:10,815 --> 00:05:13,511
Tom, we've got to move.
They've got DeVries.

20
00:05:13,551 --> 00:05:15,178
High-speed pursuit,
West Hollywood.

21
00:05:15,219 --> 00:05:16,345
Thanks.

22
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:53,154
Phillips.

23
00:05:58,196 --> 00:06:00,130
Let's go.

24
00:06:00,164 --> 00:06:01,756
Yes, sir.

25
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:05,360
All right, Johnson,
back here with me.

26
00:06:20,117 --> 00:06:21,812
Watch your ass, guys.

27
00:06:21,853 --> 00:06:23,150
Hey, Beck.

28
00:06:24,188 --> 00:06:26,713
How many units
you got in pursuit, Sandy?

29
00:06:26,757 --> 00:06:28,088
Two.

30
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,252
How long?

31
00:06:30,294 --> 00:06:31,852
I wouldn't go for coffee.

32
00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:53,112
There he is.

33
00:07:00,224 --> 00:07:01,452
Give me that.

34
00:07:32,056 --> 00:07:33,182
Tommy, come on!

35
00:08:36,087 --> 00:08:38,055
Mr. DeVries' condition
is deteriorating.

36
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:40,819
We'll have to move him
back to intensive care.

37
00:08:40,858 --> 00:08:42,155
Think he'll make it, doc?

38
00:08:42,193 --> 00:08:46,152
With all the trauma,
it's a miracle he's still alive.

39
00:08:46,197 --> 00:08:48,599
I doubt he'll last the night.

40
00:08:48,599 --> 00:08:49,759
Good.

41
00:08:51,602 --> 00:08:54,230
Keep us up to date,
will you, doc?

42
00:08:57,274 --> 00:08:58,366
Detective Beck.

43
00:08:58,409 --> 00:09:00,741
No one deserves
to die like that.

44
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:03,178
I don't care
what the man's done.

45
00:09:03,214 --> 00:09:05,739
He killed 12 people,
wounded 23 more..

46
00:09:05,783 --> 00:09:08,411
stole 6 cars,
mostly Ferraris..

47
00:09:08,452 --> 00:09:10,283
robbed 8 banks,
6 supermarkets..

48
00:09:10,321 --> 00:09:12,346
4 jewelry stores,
and a candy shop.

49
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,756
Six people he carved
with a butcher knife.

50
00:09:14,792 --> 00:09:16,521
Two of them were kids.

51
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,824
If anybody deserves
to go that way..

52
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,294
it sure in the hell was him.

53
00:09:28,406 --> 00:09:31,637
Look, Ed,
Tom Beck is the best I've got.

54
00:09:31,676 --> 00:09:34,611
If I give him to you,
I'll never get him back.

55
00:09:34,645 --> 00:09:36,806
My department will crumble..

56
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:38,405
crime will run rampant..

57
00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:40,815
the city will fall into ruin..

58
00:09:40,851 --> 00:09:44,685
hordes will control the streets,
and life as we know it will end.

59
00:09:44,722 --> 00:09:47,850
I don't want Willis.
I want Beck.

60
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:51,790
Senator's coming to announce
he's running for president.

61
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:53,228
He's gotten some threats.

62
00:09:53,264 --> 00:09:56,131
You don't want some ass
blowing him away.

63
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:59,103
Ed, Willis is a better man now.

64
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:01,435
He's been with Beck
for over a year.

65
00:10:01,472 --> 00:10:03,565
Give him another shot.

66
00:10:06,143 --> 00:10:08,668
Send Beck to my office, John.

67
00:10:17,521 --> 00:10:19,216
Lieutenant Masterson.

68
00:10:19,256 --> 00:10:21,281
Yeah, I'm Masterson.
Who are you?

69
00:10:21,325 --> 00:10:23,316
Lloyd Gallagher, FBI.

70
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,294
What can I do for you?

71
00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:26,489
I'm following a suspect.

72
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,556
I need some local
law enforcement help.

73
00:10:29,633 --> 00:10:30,759
I spoke with your captain.

74
00:10:30,801 --> 00:10:33,599
He assigned me
a Detective Thomas Beck.

75
00:10:49,787 --> 00:10:51,152
All right.

76
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,287
Beck. This is agent
Lloyd Gallagher, FBI, Seattle.

77
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:02,197
You'll be working with him
the next few days.

78
00:11:02,233 --> 00:11:05,202
I'm in the middle of a case.

79
00:11:05,236 --> 00:11:07,363
Am I supposed to drop this?

80
00:11:07,404 --> 00:11:09,133
Doesn't anybody
say please anymore?

81
00:11:09,173 --> 00:11:10,299
Please.

82
00:11:10,341 --> 00:11:13,572
Oh. How can I refuse?

83
00:11:13,611 --> 00:11:14,873
You can't.

84
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,819
Bureau's getting them younger
every day now.

85
00:11:22,853 --> 00:11:25,845
Must get them
right out of high school.

86
00:11:29,627 --> 00:11:32,187
Don't put it on my desk.

87
00:11:32,229 --> 00:11:34,754
Do not put that on my desk.

88
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,232
Give me a break.

89
00:11:36,267 --> 00:11:37,632
I haven't seen my wife
in a month.

90
00:11:37,668 --> 00:11:39,135
She's fine.

91
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,104
I was with her last night.
She said to say hello.

92
00:11:41,138 --> 00:11:43,572
Sends you a big kiss.

93
00:11:43,607 --> 00:11:45,176
She's getting fat.

94
00:11:45,176 --> 00:11:47,610
Yeah, a beer belly or something.

95
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:54,143
So who we looking for,
public enemy number one?

96
00:11:55,686 --> 00:11:58,519
His name is Jack DeVries.

97
00:12:00,724 --> 00:12:02,692
- Stockbroker?
- Right.

98
00:12:02,726 --> 00:12:04,057
How long you been after him?

99
00:12:04,094 --> 00:12:05,493
About a month.

100
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:07,053
A month, huh?

101
00:12:07,097 --> 00:12:09,657
Why don't you go
buy yourself a drink?

102
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,792
Why?

103
00:12:10,835 --> 00:12:13,269
He's in the hospital.
He's dying.

104
00:12:13,304 --> 00:12:15,306
- Which hospital?
- St. Joseph's.

105
00:12:15,306 --> 00:12:16,500
First and Main.

106
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,872
He ain't going anywhere.
What's your hurry?

107
00:13:30,214 --> 00:13:31,681
Clear.

108
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,749
Still no rhythm.

109
00:13:34,785 --> 00:13:36,753
Can you feel a pulse?

110
00:13:36,787 --> 00:13:37,879
Nothing.

111
00:13:38,088 --> 00:13:40,454
OK. Let's try it again.

112
00:13:40,491 --> 00:13:42,186
Clear.

113
00:13:48,632 --> 00:13:50,190
Doctor, are you OK?

114
00:13:50,234 --> 00:13:51,326
Yeah, I'm OK.

115
00:13:51,368 --> 00:13:52,460
What happened?

116
00:13:52,503 --> 00:13:53,800
I don't know.

117
00:13:56,507 --> 00:13:58,134
Doctor.

118
00:14:06,417 --> 00:14:09,386
I got one patient
dead on the floor.

119
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,389
Are you saying
a man in his condition..

120
00:14:12,423 --> 00:14:14,823
walked the hell out of here?

121
00:14:14,858 --> 00:14:17,190
He left when I went after you.

122
00:14:17,227 --> 00:14:18,592
What do you mean?

123
00:14:20,731 --> 00:14:22,164
Can I help you?

124
00:14:28,605 --> 00:14:30,402
FBI.

125
00:14:30,441 --> 00:14:33,535
Mr. Miller has an extremely
bad stomach condition.

126
00:14:33,577 --> 00:14:34,805
Severe gastritis.

127
00:14:34,845 --> 00:14:37,814
His heart deteriorated
to where we had to schedule..

128
00:14:37,848 --> 00:14:39,213
a triple bypass.

129
00:14:39,249 --> 00:14:43,151
Yesterday afternoon
he had a massive coronary..

130
00:14:43,187 --> 00:14:45,747
but today it was as if he just..

131
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:47,484
Got up and walked out.

132
00:14:47,524 --> 00:14:49,492
I can't really explain it..

133
00:14:49,526 --> 00:14:53,155
but I know that's not the man
you're looking for.

134
00:14:53,197 --> 00:14:56,428
Jonathan Miller would never
do anything to break the law.

135
00:14:56,467 --> 00:14:59,265
He's a very kind,
honest gentleman.

136
00:15:11,215 --> 00:15:12,375
Grandpa!

137
00:15:13,384 --> 00:15:16,376
What are you,
stupid or something?

138
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,149
I'm talking to you, wank.

139
00:15:23,093 --> 00:15:24,219
I said I'm..

140
00:15:27,564 --> 00:15:29,498
I'm going to kill you.

141
00:16:17,314 --> 00:16:18,440
Asshole.

142
00:16:30,227 --> 00:16:32,195
Beck, we should get started.

143
00:16:32,229 --> 00:16:33,564
On what?

144
00:16:33,564 --> 00:16:36,863
I got a news flash for you..
DeVries is dead.

145
00:16:41,305 --> 00:16:43,640
Who's this,
public enemy number two?

146
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,200
His name is Jonathan P. Miller.

147
00:16:46,243 --> 00:16:48,234
I need to find him.

148
00:16:56,587 --> 00:16:59,420
Get away. Do not put that..

149
00:16:59,456 --> 00:17:02,482
Beck, it wasn't funny
the first time.

150
00:17:02,526 --> 00:17:04,391
This better be good.

151
00:17:08,665 --> 00:17:10,223
Quite the desperado.

152
00:17:11,235 --> 00:17:13,237
Still handing out
the death penalty..

153
00:17:13,237 --> 00:17:14,727
for unpaid traffic tickets?

154
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,537
I don't do traffic tickets.

155
00:17:38,295 --> 00:17:42,698
You got a body at a record shop
on Melrose and Stanley.

156
00:17:46,403 --> 00:17:48,394
What is it, a full moon?

157
00:17:51,441 --> 00:17:53,841
How's it going, Sarge?

158
00:17:53,877 --> 00:17:56,437
Hey, Frankie, how's it going?

159
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,448
You check the back room?

160
00:17:58,482 --> 00:17:59,881
Yeah. It's clear.

161
00:18:04,655 --> 00:18:06,646
What have we got here?

162
00:18:07,691 --> 00:18:10,216
Hey, Beck, there's a witness.

163
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,229
Apparently she came in
right after it happened.

164
00:18:13,263 --> 00:18:15,754
She got a good look at the guy.

165
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:17,061
Where is she?

166
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,192
Right here.

167
00:18:18,235 --> 00:18:20,669
Yeah. He was carrying a radio.

168
00:18:28,412 --> 00:18:30,380
What are you doing here?

169
00:18:30,414 --> 00:18:33,383
I'm checking on a couple
of traffic tickets.

170
00:18:33,417 --> 00:18:34,543
Come here.

171
00:18:37,521 --> 00:18:39,045
Sanchez, call the coroner.

172
00:18:39,089 --> 00:18:42,081
See if he can come
sometime today.

173
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,794
That way over there.

174
00:18:45,829 --> 00:18:48,389
How tall would you say he was?

175
00:18:48,432 --> 00:18:51,196
What does this
have to do with you?

176
00:18:51,235 --> 00:18:52,463
You're out of line.

177
00:18:52,502 --> 00:18:54,470
The guy you want is dead.

178
00:18:54,504 --> 00:18:56,096
Your job is done.

179
00:18:56,139 --> 00:18:59,734
I suggest you take
the next flight to Seattle.

180
00:19:08,218 --> 00:19:09,617
How we doing here?

181
00:19:09,653 --> 00:19:10,779
Hey, Sarge.

182
00:19:12,823 --> 00:19:14,450
What do you think?

183
00:19:16,526 --> 00:19:17,618
Is this him?

184
00:19:17,661 --> 00:19:18,787
It's him.

185
00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:25,258
Brem, print this
and circulate it.

186
00:19:25,302 --> 00:19:27,237
Put out a felony warrant
on Jonathan P. Miller..

187
00:19:27,237 --> 00:19:28,568
armed and dangerous.

188
00:19:28,605 --> 00:19:30,197
Shall we get started?

189
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:34,470
You have that picture of Miller?

190
00:19:40,117 --> 00:19:41,345
Use this instead.

191
00:19:41,385 --> 00:19:43,785
How did you know about Miller?

192
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,344
He worked with DeVries.

193
00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:47,414
Pulling illegal U-turns?

194
00:19:47,457 --> 00:19:50,085
He didn't have a record
till two weeks ago.

195
00:19:50,127 --> 00:19:51,219
Long before that.

196
00:19:51,261 --> 00:19:52,455
Not according to our files.

197
00:19:52,496 --> 00:19:54,293
No. According to our files.

198
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,726
If you want my help,
tell me what's going on.

199
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:02,204
A criminal's come to your city.

200
00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:04,641
You've been assigned
to help me find him.

201
00:20:04,641 --> 00:20:06,199
If it's that simple..

202
00:20:06,243 --> 00:20:09,212
why's the Bureau
sending you down here?

203
00:20:09,246 --> 00:20:10,338
You don't have
anything on Miller..

204
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,712
because he's always
changing his identity.

205
00:20:12,749 --> 00:20:15,309
You didn't have anything
on DeVries..

206
00:20:15,352 --> 00:20:18,321
until you caught up
with him as DeVries.

207
00:20:18,355 --> 00:20:21,324
Before that,
he was Arvin J. Lusk.

208
00:20:21,358 --> 00:20:23,883
Before that, William Butler.

209
00:20:24,094 --> 00:20:26,096
Miller does the same thing.

210
00:20:26,096 --> 00:20:28,496
This is the closest I've been.

211
00:20:28,532 --> 00:20:31,899
He's got to be stopped
before he moves again.

212
00:20:32,135 --> 00:20:33,534
We'll take my car.

213
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,505
Let's go.

214
00:20:58,762 --> 00:21:01,128
Bureau must be paying
pretty good these days.

215
00:21:01,164 --> 00:21:02,290
Pretty good.

216
00:21:11,742 --> 00:21:14,734
Mind me asking how much
one of these costs?

217
00:21:18,181 --> 00:21:19,409
How much?

218
00:21:19,449 --> 00:21:20,848
I don't know.

219
00:21:22,452 --> 00:21:23,851
You don't know.

220
00:21:23,887 --> 00:21:26,378
What did you do, steal it?

221
00:22:05,495 --> 00:22:08,328
Hey, can you turn that down?

222
00:22:08,365 --> 00:22:10,697
Order up on number three.

223
00:22:14,438 --> 00:22:17,373
One coffee, right?

224
00:22:23,547 --> 00:22:27,347
Senator Holt is drawing a crowd
wherever he goes.

225
00:22:27,384 --> 00:22:30,148
The senator, who was expected
to announce his candidacy..

226
00:22:30,187 --> 00:22:32,621
for president
in Los Angeles tomorrow..

227
00:22:32,656 --> 00:22:36,148
is in town to dedicate a new
branch of Child Help U.S.A.

228
00:22:38,295 --> 00:22:40,263
The work of this organization..

229
00:22:40,263 --> 00:22:43,255
in bettering the lives
of young people here..

230
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,598
stands as an example..

231
00:22:45,635 --> 00:22:47,694
that government
can and should serve..

232
00:22:47,737 --> 00:22:50,501
the needs of the small
as well as the giant.

233
00:22:54,344 --> 00:22:55,436
Senator, is it true..

234
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:57,777
you'll be announcing
your campaign plans Tuesday?

235
00:22:57,814 --> 00:23:00,339
You'll have to wait
till next Tuesday.

236
00:23:00,383 --> 00:23:02,044
Bye, guys. Thank you.

237
00:23:02,085 --> 00:23:03,484
And now Capitol Hill.

238
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,489
An old ship
is making new waves..

239
00:23:17,567 --> 00:23:19,091
It's your table, honey.

240
00:23:19,135 --> 00:23:20,466
Don't look at me.

241
00:24:04,681 --> 00:24:06,842
How far is St. Joseph's
from here?

242
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,312
About a mile.
Why?

243
00:24:08,351 --> 00:24:10,342
Which direction?

244
00:24:10,387 --> 00:24:12,685
We'll start up here
and work back.

245
00:24:12,722 --> 00:24:14,280
You're calling the shots now?

246
00:24:14,324 --> 00:24:16,315
I know how the suspect operates.
There's little time.

247
00:24:16,393 --> 00:24:17,724
How do you know Miller
was at the hospital?

248
00:24:17,761 --> 00:24:19,228
A hunch.

249
00:24:19,262 --> 00:24:21,321
What, was he visiting DeVries?

250
00:24:21,364 --> 00:24:25,391
Just tell me. Let's cut out
the Twenty Questions.

251
00:24:25,435 --> 00:24:26,561
We're on the same side.

252
00:24:26,603 --> 00:24:30,596
Miller came from the hospital.
He was there to see DeVries.

253
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,131
That's illuminating.
That solves everything.

254
00:24:33,176 --> 00:24:35,178
Miller doesn't have a chance.

255
00:24:35,178 --> 00:24:37,180
Why would he kill a guy..

256
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,580
for a lousy hundred dollars
and a radio?

257
00:24:39,616 --> 00:24:41,174
'Cause he likes it.

258
00:24:41,217 --> 00:24:44,186
He sees something he wants,
he steals it.

259
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,450
Something gets in his way,
he kills it.

260
00:24:46,489 --> 00:24:49,458
And right now,
he's hiding out in your city.

261
00:24:49,492 --> 00:24:52,359
You're talking about Miller.
Sounds more like DeVries.

262
00:24:52,395 --> 00:24:54,795
Could you be a little confused?

263
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:14,845
So, you impressed?

264
00:25:16,386 --> 00:25:17,512
I'm impressed.

265
00:25:19,322 --> 00:25:22,291
That's because this car
makes an impression.

266
00:25:22,325 --> 00:25:25,294
The question is,
do I trade in my Mercedes..

267
00:25:25,328 --> 00:25:27,728
or just hang on to it?

268
00:25:27,764 --> 00:25:29,095
I want this car.

269
00:25:29,132 --> 00:25:31,100
I'll bet you do, dear.

270
00:25:31,134 --> 00:25:33,534
Shall we go to my office?

271
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,128
Yeah.
Excuse me.

272
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,344
Sir, please.
Don't. Don't.

273
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,749
It's not a toy.

274
00:25:48,785 --> 00:25:51,413
Just let me finish
with this gentleman..

275
00:25:51,454 --> 00:25:53,854
and I'll show you another car.

276
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,414
I want this car.

277
00:25:55,458 --> 00:25:56,857
This car is sold.

278
00:25:57,661 --> 00:25:59,185
Thank you.

279
00:26:01,064 --> 00:26:02,725
Hey, buddy.

280
00:26:02,766 --> 00:26:04,734
I'm buying this car.

281
00:26:04,768 --> 00:26:06,360
Don't touch it.

282
00:26:09,806 --> 00:26:11,603
We get occasional mental cases.

283
00:26:11,641 --> 00:26:13,131
I'll take care of it.
Eddie!

284
00:26:19,249 --> 00:26:20,375
Come in.

285
00:26:26,856 --> 00:26:29,290
Hey, dickhead.

286
00:26:30,694 --> 00:26:33,356
What do you think you're doing?

287
00:26:33,396 --> 00:26:35,227
I need the keys.

288
00:26:35,265 --> 00:26:37,392
Fine.
Out of the car.

289
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,367
Don't come back.

290
00:26:45,408 --> 00:26:48,309
I won't be as friendly
next time.

291
00:26:55,185 --> 00:26:57,415
What is your problem?

292
00:26:57,454 --> 00:26:58,682
You understand English?

293
00:26:58,722 --> 00:27:00,781
Beat it!

294
00:27:00,824 --> 00:27:03,418
You want a broken nose,
you got it.

295
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:10,664
What was that?

296
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,258
Just a backfire.

297
00:27:12,302 --> 00:27:14,566
Not one of yours, I hope.

298
00:27:14,604 --> 00:27:17,129
No way, my friend.

299
00:27:17,173 --> 00:27:19,403
Have some more.
It's good stuff.

300
00:27:19,442 --> 00:27:20,704
Thank you.

301
00:27:20,744 --> 00:27:23,611
How you doing?

302
00:27:23,646 --> 00:27:25,671
Feeling good now, huh?

303
00:27:25,715 --> 00:27:27,808
You'll feel good when you do
a hundred with this baby.

304
00:27:27,851 --> 00:27:29,751
A hundred? In the city?

305
00:27:29,786 --> 00:27:31,720
In the city.
Where else?

306
00:27:31,755 --> 00:27:33,518
Anybody can do it
on the freeway.

307
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:38,190
I'm busy!

308
00:27:38,228 --> 00:27:40,287
I want the car!

309
00:27:42,298 --> 00:27:45,062
What the hell is that wacko
still doing here?

310
00:27:45,101 --> 00:27:46,261
Give me a minute.

311
00:27:48,071 --> 00:27:50,767
What the hell is Eddie
doing out there?

312
00:27:52,876 --> 00:27:54,605
Oh, my God.

313
00:27:57,147 --> 00:27:59,172
I need the keys.

314
00:27:59,883 --> 00:28:01,145
Give him the keys.

315
00:28:01,184 --> 00:28:02,776
I just signed the paper.

316
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:04,411
Give him the fucking keys!

317
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:08,816
Thank you.

318
00:28:29,112 --> 00:28:32,081
We got a couple of cars
out there with plates on them.

319
00:28:32,148 --> 00:28:35,743
One, a three-oh-eight,
to Anthony Mercurio.

320
00:28:35,785 --> 00:28:39,277
Another one, a Mercedes
registered to Anchor lmports.

321
00:28:39,322 --> 00:28:41,290
I think it's this stiff's here.

322
00:28:41,324 --> 00:28:43,292
No name.
His wallet was lifted.

323
00:28:43,326 --> 00:28:44,850
We're running it down now.

324
00:28:45,061 --> 00:28:46,494
Anybody contacted the owner?

325
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:47,757
It's in the works.

326
00:28:47,797 --> 00:28:51,563
Contact him. Check inventory
for anything missing.

327
00:28:51,601 --> 00:28:54,069
They were finishing a deal
for a red Mondial.

328
00:28:54,103 --> 00:28:55,263
It's not here.

329
00:28:55,305 --> 00:28:56,499
He took it.

330
00:28:57,507 --> 00:28:58,872
How do you know?

331
00:28:59,075 --> 00:29:00,372
He likes Ferraris.

332
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,440
Put out a want and felony
warrant on the Ferrari.

333
00:29:07,483 --> 00:29:08,575
Gotcha.

334
00:29:08,651 --> 00:29:09,743
Come on.

335
00:29:09,786 --> 00:29:11,413
Four dead bodies in four hours.

336
00:29:11,454 --> 00:29:13,649
I want Miller now!

337
00:29:29,739 --> 00:29:31,206
Get in.

338
00:29:48,291 --> 00:29:50,384
We could go over there.

339
00:29:52,729 --> 00:29:55,220
Fuck off!

340
00:30:32,635 --> 00:30:35,627
Know what bothers me
about DeVries and Miller?

341
00:30:35,672 --> 00:30:37,640
Neither has a criminal record.

342
00:30:37,674 --> 00:30:41,440
Both led normal lives,
and now they're killing people.

343
00:30:41,477 --> 00:30:44,708
You read minds,
or was that a shot in the dark?

344
00:30:44,747 --> 00:30:46,339
I read minds.

345
00:30:46,382 --> 00:30:48,475
Oh, yeah?
What was I just thinking?

346
00:30:48,518 --> 00:30:49,746
That I'm full of shit.

347
00:30:49,786 --> 00:30:50,912
Impressive.

348
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,213
Not really.
Pretty simple to read.

349
00:31:02,065 --> 00:31:03,430
I don't read minds.

350
00:31:03,466 --> 00:31:07,300
Are you doing your job,
or is this something personal?

351
00:31:07,337 --> 00:31:10,306
I guess you could say
it's personal.

352
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,103
He killed my partner.

353
00:31:15,345 --> 00:31:16,505
Which one?

354
00:31:17,547 --> 00:31:20,243
Which one killed your partner?

355
00:31:20,283 --> 00:31:21,443
Both.

356
00:31:22,885 --> 00:31:25,479
I'm surprised the Bureau
let you stay on the case.

357
00:31:25,555 --> 00:31:26,886
I hear they're not big
on revenge.

358
00:31:28,758 --> 00:31:31,318
What would you do?

359
00:31:31,361 --> 00:31:32,692
As a cop?

360
00:31:32,729 --> 00:31:34,321
As a man.

361
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,398
I lost a partner once.

362
00:31:41,671 --> 00:31:43,229
We'll get Miller.

363
00:34:30,606 --> 00:34:32,369
Buckley owns Anchor lmports..

364
00:34:32,408 --> 00:34:34,103
which owns the Mercedes.

365
00:34:34,143 --> 00:34:36,611
Let's see if Mr. Buckley
has a record.

366
00:34:39,849 --> 00:34:43,182
Looks like this guy's
an arms dealer.

367
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:44,777
Carrying a concealed weapon..

368
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,515
possession
of narcotics for sale..

369
00:34:46,556 --> 00:34:49,184
firearms possession..

370
00:34:49,225 --> 00:34:51,193
Another law-abiding citizen,
huh?

371
00:34:54,597 --> 00:34:56,588
What the hell is that?

372
00:34:56,632 --> 00:34:58,293
Flamethrower.
You believe it?

373
00:34:58,334 --> 00:35:02,236
Patrol grabbed it
from some homeboy on the street.

374
00:35:02,271 --> 00:35:05,297
What happened to the days
of zip guns?

375
00:35:05,341 --> 00:35:08,139
Get two units
to his home and office now.

376
00:35:09,145 --> 00:35:10,510
Sanchez.
Homicide.

377
00:35:10,546 --> 00:35:11,638
Sure, hold on.

378
00:35:11,681 --> 00:35:13,672
Beck, I think it's your wife.

379
00:35:17,853 --> 00:35:20,185
Hi. No, I'm sorry.

380
00:35:20,223 --> 00:35:22,214
About fifteen minutes.

381
00:35:26,062 --> 00:35:28,792
Hold on. What are you
doing for dinner?

382
00:35:28,831 --> 00:35:31,561
Sorry. I got plans.
You know, ladies.

383
00:35:31,601 --> 00:35:33,228
Not you, Sanchez.

384
00:35:36,405 --> 00:35:37,497
No plans.

385
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,838
I'm bringing somebody
for dinner.

386
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:51,118
You coming?

387
00:35:53,756 --> 00:35:55,815
I suppose you live in a castle.

388
00:35:55,858 --> 00:35:59,294
Apartment.
One bedroom, one bath.

389
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,638
Want a beer or something?

390
00:36:09,672 --> 00:36:11,230
Whatever you're having.

391
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,196
"She climbed up
on his long tail..

392
00:37:14,236 --> 00:37:16,227
"and walked up his back.

393
00:37:16,272 --> 00:37:19,105
"When she was comfortable,
they walked on.

394
00:37:19,141 --> 00:37:21,632
"They reached the end
of the forest..

395
00:37:21,677 --> 00:37:24,646
"and the fairy princess
began to laugh with joy.

396
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,241
"There was the shiny castle
on the mountaintop.."

397
00:37:28,284 --> 00:37:29,683
And here's Daddy.

398
00:37:31,153 --> 00:37:32,245
Hi, Mommy.

399
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,690
Hi, baby.
How was your day?

400
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:35,816
Interesting.

401
00:37:35,858 --> 00:37:37,257
Hi, Daddy.

402
00:37:37,293 --> 00:37:39,124
How's my girl?

403
00:37:40,296 --> 00:37:41,388
Boy!

404
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:43,159
Did you feed your turtle?

405
00:37:43,866 --> 00:37:46,334
Wait till you see
the painting she did.

406
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:48,633
She's got it
on the refrigerator already.

407
00:37:49,872 --> 00:37:51,772
Who've we got for dinner?

408
00:37:51,807 --> 00:37:53,104
FBI.

409
00:37:53,142 --> 00:37:55,667
Well, at least they're polite.

410
00:37:59,248 --> 00:38:02,445
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you were standing there.

411
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,188
Honey, this is Lloyd Gallagher.

412
00:38:06,222 --> 00:38:08,053
This is my wife Barbara.

413
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:11,321
It's very nice to have you
with us, Lloyd.

414
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,692
It's nice to be here, Barbara.

415
00:38:15,231 --> 00:38:17,426
I don't mean to disturb you.

416
00:38:17,466 --> 00:38:19,434
That's OK.
Come on in.

417
00:38:19,468 --> 00:38:21,436
This is our daughter Juliet.

418
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:23,768
Want to say good night
to Mr. Gallagher?

419
00:38:51,434 --> 00:38:52,765
Good night, baby.

420
00:39:25,234 --> 00:39:28,533
Well, um.. Tommy tells me
you're from Seattle.

421
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,466
I'm sorry?

422
00:39:34,543 --> 00:39:36,101
You're from Seattle?

423
00:39:36,145 --> 00:39:40,275
Where you're going back to
when you're done here.

424
00:39:41,817 --> 00:39:44,809
Yes.
I'll go home when I'm finished.

425
00:39:44,854 --> 00:39:47,414
Is that where
you're from originally?

426
00:39:49,525 --> 00:39:50,651
From?

427
00:39:53,562 --> 00:39:55,553
Where did you grow up?

428
00:40:03,472 --> 00:40:04,803
What's that, north?

429
00:40:05,808 --> 00:40:08,641
I have some relatives up north.

430
00:40:08,677 --> 00:40:09,803
What town?

431
00:40:14,617 --> 00:40:15,709
Ras Alhague.

432
00:40:15,751 --> 00:40:18,720
And that's in the United States?

433
00:40:18,754 --> 00:40:21,848
Well, I never heard of that one.

434
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:30,091
Your little girl.

435
00:40:34,203 --> 00:40:35,465
She's very..

436
00:40:36,906 --> 00:40:38,464
special.

437
00:40:41,911 --> 00:40:43,572
Yeah, I think so.

438
00:40:43,612 --> 00:40:45,204
You love her.

439
00:40:45,247 --> 00:40:48,216
Yes, we love her.
She's our daughter.

440
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,514
Don't FBI agents
love their kids?

441
00:40:50,553 --> 00:40:52,214
Tommy, I don't think he..

442
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:55,880
What about you?

443
00:40:56,125 --> 00:40:57,251
You married?

444
00:40:59,261 --> 00:41:01,092
- I was.
- Kids?

445
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:03,223
- One.
- Divorced?

446
00:41:03,265 --> 00:41:04,698
My wife is dead.

447
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:15,474
She and my little girl..

448
00:41:15,511 --> 00:41:19,572
were killed by the man
who killed my partner.

449
00:41:22,484 --> 00:41:23,883
I'm very sorry.

450
00:41:37,633 --> 00:41:39,100
Take it all off!

451
00:41:46,875 --> 00:41:50,106
I love you, darling!
I love you!

452
00:41:50,145 --> 00:41:51,544
That's my wife
you're talking about!

453
00:42:39,662 --> 00:42:42,460
Freddie, can I have
a bourbon and soda?

454
00:42:42,498 --> 00:42:44,591
You got it.
OK.

455
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,240
Hey, buddy, you OK?

456
00:42:55,444 --> 00:42:57,412
I said are you OK?

457
00:42:57,446 --> 00:42:59,437
You look kind of pasty.

458
00:43:00,416 --> 00:43:01,542
I'm fine.

459
00:43:04,053 --> 00:43:05,247
Sure.

460
00:44:11,587 --> 00:44:15,421
This is six Adam forty-two
requesting assistance.

461
00:44:15,457 --> 00:44:17,482
We have located missing Ferrari.

462
00:44:22,698 --> 00:44:23,824
Where?

463
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,724
I'm on my way.

464
00:44:39,348 --> 00:44:41,316
Let's go, Lloyd.

465
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:43,545
We got to get going.
They found the Ferrari.

466
00:44:43,585 --> 00:44:45,348
Brought you some Alka-Seltzer.

467
00:44:50,492 --> 00:44:51,584
It's Alka-Seltzer.

468
00:44:51,627 --> 00:44:55,154
You put it in water
and drink it.

469
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:03,763
Lloyd, as a friend..

470
00:45:03,806 --> 00:45:05,433
stay away from alcohol.

471
00:45:17,152 --> 00:45:18,551
Give me a break.

472
00:45:22,157 --> 00:45:24,557
Hey, pal, the show's over, OK?

473
00:45:28,297 --> 00:45:30,731
Can you take it outside, please?

474
00:45:31,667 --> 00:45:32,793
Please?

475
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,229
Hey, Robbie!

476
00:45:50,853 --> 00:45:52,821
All right, man, come on.

477
00:46:06,101 --> 00:46:07,591
Let's go!

478
00:46:07,636 --> 00:46:10,196
Shit!

479
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:11,501
Hey, officer!

480
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:14,532
We didn't do nothing!

481
00:46:14,576 --> 00:46:17,272
We're clean.

482
00:46:17,312 --> 00:46:19,109
Hey, baby.

483
00:46:19,147 --> 00:46:20,774
How you doing?

484
00:46:20,816 --> 00:46:22,647
Hey, where you going?

485
00:46:22,684 --> 00:46:26,450
I thought the show was inside.

486
00:46:26,488 --> 00:46:28,854
Stay away from that Ferrari,
please.

487
00:46:29,057 --> 00:46:31,457
Ma'am?
That's a police suspect vehicle.

488
00:46:37,466 --> 00:46:38,626
Yo, baby!

489
00:46:39,735 --> 00:46:42,704
Hey, honey, you know,
what's your hurry?

490
00:46:42,738 --> 00:46:45,641
The night's still young, and..

491
00:46:45,641 --> 00:46:48,838
Your name is Brenda, right?

492
00:46:48,877 --> 00:46:51,539
I seen you before.

493
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:53,275
Say, uh..

494
00:46:54,449 --> 00:46:55,848
Do you like cars?

495
00:46:57,152 --> 00:47:01,418
'Cause I got a great car,
and it's, uh..

496
00:47:01,456 --> 00:47:04,220
parked right over there
in that lot.

497
00:47:06,461 --> 00:47:08,019
What do you say?

498
00:47:11,233 --> 00:47:12,359
Yeah, baby.

499
00:47:12,401 --> 00:47:14,801
Come on.

500
00:47:16,405 --> 00:47:18,373
What have we got here?

501
00:47:18,407 --> 00:47:21,342
Been a long time
since we've seen one of these.

502
00:47:21,376 --> 00:47:23,344
What the hell's this?

503
00:47:23,378 --> 00:47:25,369
Looks like he's bled to death.

504
00:47:25,414 --> 00:47:26,574
What, from this?

505
00:47:26,615 --> 00:47:27,843
You find a weapon?

506
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:29,677
No weapon, I.D., nothing.

507
00:47:29,718 --> 00:47:32,346
This is getting stale, Tom.

508
00:47:32,387 --> 00:47:33,786
Check on the coroner.

509
00:47:33,822 --> 00:47:36,313
I'll get you an E.T.A.

510
00:47:36,358 --> 00:47:38,258
Sir..

511
00:47:38,293 --> 00:47:39,590
Here's some aspirin, sir.

512
00:47:39,628 --> 00:47:41,391
Beck thought
you might need them.

513
00:48:07,823 --> 00:48:09,688
What are you doing?

514
00:49:10,652 --> 00:49:13,621
Yo, Beck. Caught beautiful here
trying to leave.

515
00:49:13,655 --> 00:49:16,624
She's the one
that found the body.

516
00:49:16,658 --> 00:49:18,387
Let me have a minute.

517
00:49:19,428 --> 00:49:22,158
Sorry.
It's been a hell of a night.

518
00:49:22,197 --> 00:49:23,323
Are you OK?

519
00:49:24,399 --> 00:49:27,425
Can you tell me what you saw?

520
00:49:27,469 --> 00:49:30,529
I saw Brenda walk out
on my way in.

521
00:49:30,572 --> 00:49:32,540
This guy was on the floor.

522
00:49:32,574 --> 00:49:34,838
I screamed, and the cops came.

523
00:49:35,043 --> 00:49:37,034
You ever seen this guy before?

524
00:49:39,815 --> 00:49:42,249
You sure
you never seen this guy?

525
00:49:42,284 --> 00:49:43,685
I know Brenda.

526
00:49:43,685 --> 00:49:46,688
She'd never have anything
to do with that creep.

527
00:49:46,688 --> 00:49:49,589
- Beck.
- What?

528
00:49:49,624 --> 00:49:51,558
We need to find her.

529
00:49:52,627 --> 00:49:55,562
You trying to tell me
that she's part of this?

530
00:49:55,597 --> 00:49:58,794
Hey, Tom, you ain't going
to believe this.

531
00:49:58,834 --> 00:50:00,324
We have another stiff.

532
00:50:00,368 --> 00:50:02,495
In the parking lot.

533
00:50:03,505 --> 00:50:05,268
I don't believe this.

534
00:50:05,307 --> 00:50:07,366
Thank you for your help.

535
00:50:07,409 --> 00:50:10,139
What's he doing
with his pants down?

536
00:50:10,178 --> 00:50:12,806
What the hell
you think he's doing?

537
00:50:12,848 --> 00:50:14,645
Busy night, huh, Beck?

538
00:50:14,683 --> 00:50:16,548
Getting a little crowded
in my van, you know?

539
00:50:16,585 --> 00:50:18,815
Joey, let me know
when this guy gets posted.

540
00:50:18,854 --> 00:50:20,116
Yeah, right.

541
00:50:20,155 --> 00:50:21,713
- Cliff, get these out.
- Gotcha.

542
00:50:21,756 --> 00:50:23,621
Come here.

543
00:50:30,799 --> 00:50:34,166
In a span of twelve hours,
I've got five bodies..

544
00:50:34,202 --> 00:50:35,567
not counting Miller..

545
00:50:35,604 --> 00:50:38,334
who dies because he
runs out of blood.

546
00:50:38,373 --> 00:50:40,136
A stripper
screws some guy to death..

547
00:50:40,175 --> 00:50:42,302
steals his car, and takes off.

548
00:50:42,344 --> 00:50:44,369
All this in twelve hours.

549
00:50:44,412 --> 00:50:46,778
I ask you, am I crazy..

550
00:50:46,815 --> 00:50:49,511
or does this seem
just a little bizarre?

551
00:50:51,553 --> 00:50:53,521
Yeah, it's a little bizarre.

552
00:50:56,124 --> 00:50:58,126
I knew that.

553
00:50:58,126 --> 00:51:01,618
I just wanted to know
if you knew that.

554
00:51:17,112 --> 00:51:18,670
Let's get out of here.

555
00:51:34,596 --> 00:51:36,655
Step out of the car slowly.

556
00:51:36,698 --> 00:51:39,531
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

557
00:51:53,548 --> 00:51:56,540
It's going to be
one of those nights.

558
00:51:57,852 --> 00:51:59,547
Watch it!

559
00:52:13,702 --> 00:52:15,169
Shit.

560
00:52:19,307 --> 00:52:21,537
Holy smoke.

561
00:52:22,544 --> 00:52:25,138
Suspect is armed
and headed eastbound.

562
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:28,240
I'd say we're going
the right way.

563
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:33,346
There it is.

564
00:52:52,107 --> 00:52:53,665
You bitch.

565
00:53:11,092 --> 00:53:12,684
Shit!

566
00:53:12,727 --> 00:53:14,854
God damn it!

567
00:53:19,267 --> 00:53:21,292
Why not try for the tires?

568
00:53:21,336 --> 00:53:22,769
I'm trying to.

569
00:53:22,804 --> 00:53:25,136
You think it's easy?
Why don't you try it?

570
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:29,641
Son of a..

571
00:53:34,416 --> 00:53:35,883
Hold the wheel.

572
00:53:36,084 --> 00:53:38,211
You hold it.
You wanted to..

573
00:53:38,253 --> 00:53:39,584
What are you doing?

574
00:53:39,621 --> 00:53:41,111
Jesus!

575
00:53:49,798 --> 00:53:52,358
You're out of your damn mind!

576
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:16,689
You're fucking nuts.

577
00:54:26,735 --> 00:54:28,293
I'm going in.

578
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:33,298
I'll cover you.

579
00:54:34,442 --> 00:54:37,240
I'd be safer if you didn't.

580
00:54:37,278 --> 00:54:38,802
Fine. I won't cover you.

581
00:54:40,348 --> 00:54:41,576
All right. Cover me.

582
00:54:41,616 --> 00:54:44,449
Want me to cover you or not?

583
00:54:44,486 --> 00:54:46,716
I need you to cover me.

584
00:54:46,755 --> 00:54:48,347
Fine. I'll cover you.

585
00:54:50,725 --> 00:54:51,851
Jesus Christ.

586
00:56:59,587 --> 00:57:02,681
She's bleeding to death.
Why doesn't she go down?

587
00:57:02,724 --> 00:57:05,022
We got to get to her
before she dies.

588
00:57:05,059 --> 00:57:06,651
Why don't we wait
till after she's dead?

589
00:59:41,082 --> 00:59:43,346
You think it's over now.

590
00:59:44,352 --> 00:59:46,183
You're wrong.

591
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:55,461
I'm not coming out yet.

592
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:02,162
I'll kill you first.

593
01:00:33,301 --> 01:00:34,700
Roy, come..

594
01:00:34,736 --> 01:00:36,169
God!

595
01:00:51,719 --> 01:00:52,811
Lieutenant.

596
01:00:52,854 --> 01:00:54,378
Yeah, Willis,
what's your status?

597
01:00:54,422 --> 01:00:56,356
Broad just jumped, around back.

598
01:00:57,625 --> 01:00:59,354
Go on ahead.

599
01:01:07,435 --> 01:01:08,629
- Halt!
- FBI!

600
01:01:08,669 --> 01:01:10,432
Get away from the body!

601
01:01:14,609 --> 01:01:17,442
The party's over, pal.
She's dead.

602
01:01:17,478 --> 01:01:19,810
She's dead, Lieutenant.
Hell of a night, huh?

603
01:01:19,847 --> 01:01:21,781
Who was here?
Who touched the body?

604
01:01:21,816 --> 01:01:23,306
She's dead, Mr. Gallagher.

605
01:01:23,351 --> 01:01:25,319
It's over.

606
01:01:25,386 --> 01:01:26,478
Nelson, this is Willis.

607
01:01:26,521 --> 01:01:29,149
Check on the coroner's
arrival for me.

608
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:31,590
Better bring in the
Robbery /Homicide shooting team.

609
01:01:35,830 --> 01:01:37,457
What's going on up there?

610
01:01:37,498 --> 01:01:38,897
You want us up there?

611
01:01:46,908 --> 01:01:48,535
You want to make
some room there?

612
01:01:48,576 --> 01:01:49,838
Move 'em out of the way.

613
01:01:49,877 --> 01:01:51,139
Gurney coming through.

614
01:01:51,212 --> 01:01:52,338
Joey.

615
01:01:54,582 --> 01:01:56,846
Hey, look,
it's none of my business..

616
01:01:56,884 --> 01:02:00,285
but the lady had
fifteen bullet holes in her.

617
01:02:00,321 --> 01:02:03,051
You guys like
making my job miserable, huh?

618
01:02:04,826 --> 01:02:07,386
Shouldn't you go
to the ambulance now?

619
01:02:07,428 --> 01:02:09,191
Just give me a minute.

620
01:02:10,765 --> 01:02:12,562
It's not over, is it?

621
01:02:14,602 --> 01:02:16,593
I want an explanation.

622
01:02:20,808 --> 01:02:22,537
Explanation won't help you.

623
01:02:25,213 --> 01:02:27,238
I've worked homicide
for thirteen years..

624
01:02:27,281 --> 01:02:29,806
and I've seen
a lot of strange shit.

625
01:02:29,851 --> 01:02:32,843
But I have never
seen anything like this.

626
01:02:32,887 --> 01:02:35,481
You know what's going on,
and I don't.

627
01:02:35,523 --> 01:02:36,785
You're going to tell me.

628
01:02:36,824 --> 01:02:38,621
Explanation's
not going to help you.

629
01:02:39,627 --> 01:02:41,219
I'll decide that.

630
01:02:44,498 --> 01:02:46,261
Then I'm sorry.

631
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:48,666
Hey!
Don't you walk away from me.

632
01:02:52,306 --> 01:02:55,332
What I'm after
is still out there..

633
01:02:55,376 --> 01:02:58,368
and I don't know where to start.

634
01:03:06,454 --> 01:03:08,422
Tommy, what happened to you?

635
01:03:08,456 --> 01:03:09,857
Arrest him.

636
01:03:09,857 --> 01:03:11,381
Arrest him?

637
01:03:11,425 --> 01:03:12,551
Book him.

638
01:03:19,433 --> 01:03:22,630
Lloyd..
I've got to take you downtown.

639
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:24,069
Boss' orders.

640
01:03:43,224 --> 01:03:44,521
Come on.

641
01:03:51,632 --> 01:03:54,635
Woodfield,
what are you doing up so late?

642
01:03:54,635 --> 01:03:56,193
Having a ball.

643
01:03:56,237 --> 01:03:57,761
I heard you took one.
You OK?

644
01:03:57,805 --> 01:03:59,238
Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.

645
01:04:17,625 --> 01:04:19,559
I woke you, huh?

646
01:04:21,062 --> 01:04:22,188
No, I'm fine.

647
01:04:22,229 --> 01:04:23,355
I'm fine.

648
01:04:23,397 --> 01:04:24,659
If I wasn't fine..

649
01:04:24,699 --> 01:04:26,690
somebody else would call you,
wouldn't they?

650
01:04:26,767 --> 01:04:29,361
I got into a bit of a scrape,
but no big deal.

651
01:04:29,403 --> 01:04:31,394
I'm just calling
so you won't worry.

652
01:04:31,439 --> 01:04:32,736
I'll be home soon.

653
01:04:32,773 --> 01:04:34,764
I'll, uh..

654
01:04:34,809 --> 01:04:37,539
I'll be home as soon as I can.

655
01:04:38,546 --> 01:04:40,275
I love you, too. Bye.

656
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:46,516
I hope you know what
you're doing, busting a Fed.

657
01:04:46,554 --> 01:04:48,556
Let me worry about that.

658
01:04:48,556 --> 01:04:50,114
How's the arm?

659
01:04:50,157 --> 01:04:52,250
Hey, it's a scratch.

660
01:04:52,293 --> 01:04:54,318
What the hell's this,
your press secretary?

661
01:04:54,362 --> 01:04:56,764
This is the stuff
I got from Lloyd..

662
01:04:56,764 --> 01:04:58,322
firearms, personal I. D..

663
01:04:58,366 --> 01:05:00,357
and who in the hell
knows what this is?

664
01:05:00,401 --> 01:05:03,165
Must be some kind
of special FBI toy.

665
01:05:03,204 --> 01:05:04,398
Drop it off at the lab.

666
01:05:04,438 --> 01:05:05,735
We'll see what they can
figure out in the morning.

667
01:05:05,773 --> 01:05:07,570
Gotcha. No problem.

668
01:05:09,110 --> 01:05:10,236
Thanks, partner.

669
01:05:10,277 --> 01:05:11,801
Take care of that arm.

670
01:05:12,847 --> 01:05:14,838
I got that information
you wanted.

671
01:05:18,519 --> 01:05:20,544
Seattle FBI
says Agent Lloyd Gallagher..

672
01:05:20,588 --> 01:05:22,522
was killed in a forest fire
about a month ago..

673
01:05:22,556 --> 01:05:25,559
with a friend of his
named Stone, Robert Stone.

674
01:05:25,559 --> 01:05:27,720
They were hunting
in Olympic National Forest..

675
01:05:27,762 --> 01:05:29,730
the weekend
they had that big forest fire.

676
01:05:29,764 --> 01:05:32,767
Bureau figured Stone was dead.
Never found his body.

677
01:05:32,767 --> 01:05:34,826
Just figured it burned up
in the fire.

678
01:05:37,304 --> 01:05:38,464
Is that all?

679
01:05:41,275 --> 01:05:43,766
I had them wire me
a picture of Stone.

680
01:05:43,811 --> 01:05:45,335
Evidently, Mr. Stone..

681
01:05:45,379 --> 01:05:48,371
has taken over the identity
of his dead friend.

682
01:05:57,825 --> 01:06:00,692
If you don't need me,
I'm going home.

683
01:06:02,696 --> 01:06:04,254
Brem?

684
01:06:04,298 --> 01:06:05,697
Good work.

685
01:07:02,056 --> 01:07:04,650
Excuse me, Sarge.
Where do you want him?

686
01:07:07,661 --> 01:07:09,356
Take the cuffs off him.

687
01:07:17,104 --> 01:07:19,072
You want me to stay?

688
01:07:27,515 --> 01:07:28,607
Crazy thing.

689
01:07:28,649 --> 01:07:31,083
I was starting to like you.

690
01:07:31,118 --> 01:07:32,517
Sit down.

691
01:07:43,564 --> 01:07:47,523
I checked with the FBI
in Seattle.

692
01:07:47,568 --> 01:07:50,560
Lloyd Gallagher is dead.

693
01:07:52,139 --> 01:07:55,597
Your real name is Robert Stone.

694
01:07:55,643 --> 01:07:57,838
That's about all
we know about you..

695
01:07:57,878 --> 01:07:59,311
except for the fact..

696
01:07:59,346 --> 01:08:01,177
that you're driving
a stolen Porsche..

697
01:08:01,215 --> 01:08:03,240
which is probably
the only true thing..

698
01:08:03,284 --> 01:08:05,252
that you've told us so far.

699
01:08:08,722 --> 01:08:11,714
So why don't we just
have a little talk?

700
01:08:11,759 --> 01:08:14,353
Who are you,
and what are you doing here?

701
01:08:14,395 --> 01:08:15,521
Please don't ask me that.

702
01:08:15,563 --> 01:08:17,531
Don't give me that!
I've had it with you.

703
01:08:17,565 --> 01:08:19,556
You think this
is some kind of a game?

704
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,158
You think you can waltz
into this town..

705
01:08:21,202 --> 01:08:22,601
turn my department
upside-down..

706
01:08:22,636 --> 01:08:24,194
endanger my men's lives?

707
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:26,604
I'm tired of you
jerking me around.

708
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:27,834
I want answers!

709
01:08:28,042 --> 01:08:29,407
Why does it take
fifteen shots..

710
01:08:29,443 --> 01:08:31,035
to take down
some zoned-out stripper?

711
01:08:31,078 --> 01:08:33,512
Why do three
law-abiding citizens..

712
01:08:33,547 --> 01:08:36,038
go crazy
and start killing people?

713
01:08:36,083 --> 01:08:39,416
I want answers,
and I want them now!

714
01:08:40,854 --> 01:08:45,655
Miller, the stripper,
DeVries were the same..

715
01:08:45,693 --> 01:08:47,661
and it's not human.

716
01:08:48,696 --> 01:08:50,254
Excuse me?

717
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:55,669
I've been after it
for a long time.

718
01:08:55,703 --> 01:08:59,764
Now it's here,
on Earth, in your city.

719
01:08:59,807 --> 01:09:01,536
Oh, boy.

720
01:09:04,445 --> 01:09:06,413
Are we talking spacemen here?

721
01:09:08,549 --> 01:09:11,575
The way it works is
it finds a body..

722
01:09:11,652 --> 01:09:14,712
gets inside,
uses it to move around.

723
01:09:14,755 --> 01:09:17,724
It stays in that body
until the body is so damaged..

724
01:09:17,758 --> 01:09:19,487
it has to find another body.

725
01:09:19,526 --> 01:09:21,460
That's the only time
I can kill it..

726
01:09:21,495 --> 01:09:22,723
when it's between bodies.

727
01:09:22,763 --> 01:09:25,527
I missed my chance when it came
out of the stripper.

728
01:09:25,566 --> 01:09:28,330
It found another body
and changed before I got there.

729
01:09:28,369 --> 01:09:30,735
So now we don't know
who the spaceman is.

730
01:09:32,473 --> 01:09:34,566
But I don't have to look
for it anymore.

731
01:09:34,608 --> 01:09:37,168
It knows I'm here.
It'll come after me.

732
01:09:37,211 --> 01:09:39,179
Beck, I need my weapon.

733
01:09:39,213 --> 01:09:42,080
That's the only thing
that can kill it.

734
01:09:46,186 --> 01:09:48,416
So the spaceman is the one..

735
01:09:48,455 --> 01:09:50,514
that killed your partner,
your wife..

736
01:09:50,557 --> 01:09:53,355
the one that you've been
tracking for the past..

737
01:09:53,394 --> 01:09:54,486
Nine years.

738
01:09:54,528 --> 01:09:55,620
Nine years.

739
01:09:55,663 --> 01:09:56,789
Your time.

740
01:09:58,365 --> 01:10:00,526
Our time.

741
01:10:04,371 --> 01:10:06,566
I guess
a career in the police..

742
01:10:06,607 --> 01:10:09,269
didn't really prepare you
for this, did it?

743
01:10:11,445 --> 01:10:13,106
Yes, it did.

744
01:10:15,883 --> 01:10:17,680
We'll try again later.

745
01:10:47,181 --> 01:10:48,808
It's OK.

746
01:11:13,273 --> 01:11:14,638
Good morning, Lieutenant.

747
01:11:14,675 --> 01:11:16,302
Morning.

748
01:11:16,343 --> 01:11:17,537
What's eating him?

749
01:11:17,578 --> 01:11:21,309
I thought you said
he wasn't coming in today.

750
01:11:35,796 --> 01:11:37,696
Hey, John, what do you say?

751
01:11:37,731 --> 01:11:39,460
I thought you weren't
coming in today.

752
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:42,367
I have work to do.

753
01:11:42,403 --> 01:11:44,428
I'm sorry.
This is Lieutenant Masterson.

754
01:11:44,471 --> 01:11:46,803
Carol Miller,
Senator Holt's assistant.

755
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:48,273
Agents Stadt and Lowe.

756
01:11:48,308 --> 01:11:50,902
They're handling security
for the senator's speech today.

757
01:11:51,111 --> 01:11:53,443
Holt.
The one everyone applauds.

758
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:55,414
We'd like to think so.

759
01:11:56,417 --> 01:11:57,714
Where's the speech?

760
01:11:57,751 --> 01:11:59,719
Park Plaza.
You know that.

761
01:12:00,687 --> 01:12:01,779
Yeah, five.

762
01:12:01,822 --> 01:12:04,791
Five guys in the lobby,
I think, Carol.

763
01:12:04,825 --> 01:12:06,816
Take it easy, all right?

764
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:08,425
Sure. I'll be fine.

765
01:12:08,462 --> 01:12:09,759
How are you doing, Sarge?

766
01:12:09,797 --> 01:12:11,287
Hey, Frankie, how you doing?

767
01:12:52,172 --> 01:12:53,537
That was a bomb!

768
01:12:53,574 --> 01:12:55,599
Where did that come from?

769
01:12:55,642 --> 01:12:58,133
We've got an explosion
in ballistics.

770
01:12:58,178 --> 01:13:00,112
Just sit down here.

771
01:13:01,215 --> 01:13:02,773
There's smoke
through the corridor.

772
01:13:02,816 --> 01:13:04,681
Get a fire unit over here.

773
01:13:08,322 --> 01:13:11,291
Get a fire extinguisher in here.

774
01:13:14,161 --> 01:13:15,389
Was it a bomb?

775
01:13:15,429 --> 01:13:17,158
Get him out of here!

776
01:13:17,197 --> 01:13:18,357
What happened?

777
01:13:28,308 --> 01:13:31,277
What the hell is going on?

778
01:13:31,345 --> 01:13:33,313
Hey, what's going on here?

779
01:13:33,347 --> 01:13:34,439
You!

780
01:13:34,481 --> 01:13:36,244
You?
Lieutenant, what's going on?

781
01:13:36,283 --> 01:13:37,807
Where is the other one?

782
01:13:37,851 --> 01:13:39,113
What other one?

783
01:13:39,152 --> 01:13:40,585
The one you were with.

784
01:13:40,621 --> 01:13:42,748
I locked him up.
You know that.

785
01:13:42,789 --> 01:13:44,086
I want to talk to him.

786
01:13:44,124 --> 01:13:45,216
What is this?

787
01:13:45,259 --> 01:13:48,228
Listen.
I already shot you once.

788
01:13:48,262 --> 01:13:50,753
I can hardly wait
to do it again.

789
01:13:50,797 --> 01:13:52,128
Now, let's go.

790
01:13:58,338 --> 01:13:59,464
Stay back.

791
01:13:59,506 --> 01:14:01,474
Lieutenant, what's going on?

792
01:14:01,508 --> 01:14:02,600
Get back!

793
01:14:02,643 --> 01:14:03,837
Take cover!

794
01:14:06,213 --> 01:14:07,737
Tom, you OK?

795
01:14:07,781 --> 01:14:10,375
Stay back, Cliff,
it's not Masterson.

796
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:13,347
Seal this corridor off!

797
01:14:13,387 --> 01:14:14,786
Get him out of here!

798
01:14:23,497 --> 01:14:24,794
Now, Beck!

799
01:14:26,533 --> 01:14:28,194
Freeze!

800
01:14:37,844 --> 01:14:39,744
We just dumped the lieutenant.

801
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:41,611
Get an ambulance.

802
01:14:43,717 --> 01:14:46,151
Sanchez, stay away from him.

803
01:14:52,359 --> 01:14:53,621
Brooks!

804
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:55,651
Give me your gun.

805
01:14:55,696 --> 01:14:57,186
Give me your fucking gun!

806
01:14:57,230 --> 01:14:59,289
It's in my waistband, man!

807
01:14:59,333 --> 01:15:02,734
Get a shotgun
and seal off the stairwell.

808
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:08,108
Open the gate!
Gate into C-eight!

809
01:15:08,108 --> 01:15:09,370
What the hell's going on here?

810
01:15:09,409 --> 01:15:11,400
Just open..
Masterson has flipped out..

811
01:15:11,445 --> 01:15:13,072
and he's shooting up
the station, all right?

812
01:15:13,146 --> 01:15:14,272
Check your piece, Beck.

813
01:15:16,149 --> 01:15:17,377
Give me the keys, Joe.

814
01:15:22,522 --> 01:15:23,784
Buzz the gate, Joe.

815
01:15:25,158 --> 01:15:27,388
Buzz the fucking gate!

816
01:15:31,565 --> 01:15:34,534
And watch out for Masterson!

817
01:15:38,605 --> 01:15:40,573
Hey, I need a phone call.

818
01:15:47,581 --> 01:15:50,778
I just saw Masterson
dump two cops.

819
01:15:50,817 --> 01:15:53,720
He took six hits
at point-blank range..

820
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:56,382
and he's not going down.

821
01:15:56,423 --> 01:15:58,288
Is Masterson..

822
01:16:00,093 --> 01:16:01,321
Is he dead?

823
01:16:02,329 --> 01:16:03,489
The real Masterson.

824
01:16:17,377 --> 01:16:19,607
You're going to need this.

825
01:16:21,648 --> 01:16:23,479
Hey, what's going on?

826
01:16:26,219 --> 01:16:28,153
Jesus Christ.

827
01:16:28,188 --> 01:16:29,485
Let me in.

828
01:16:29,523 --> 01:16:31,150
I can't do that, Lieutenant.

829
01:16:31,224 --> 01:16:33,488
Hey, put that down.
Don't do that.

830
01:16:33,527 --> 01:16:35,188
Get down.

831
01:16:52,245 --> 01:16:53,507
You're hit. Here.

832
01:16:53,547 --> 01:16:54,741
I know.

833
01:16:54,781 --> 01:16:56,646
Alhague.

834
01:16:57,851 --> 01:17:01,514
Before I kill you, I'm curious.

835
01:17:01,555 --> 01:17:02,749
How did you find me?

836
01:17:02,789 --> 01:17:06,122
You left an angry partner
for dead on Altair.

837
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:08,127
A mistake.

838
01:17:08,161 --> 01:17:09,526
That's what it said.

839
01:17:12,432 --> 01:17:14,229
Die, you fucker!

840
01:17:14,267 --> 01:17:15,666
Son of a bitch!

841
01:17:15,702 --> 01:17:18,068
Why don't you use
that goddamn thing?

842
01:17:18,105 --> 01:17:19,197
Not yet.

843
01:17:19,272 --> 01:17:21,069
You said it's the only thing
that kills him.

844
01:17:21,108 --> 01:17:22,442
It's not that simple.

845
01:17:22,442 --> 01:17:25,639
Alhague,
how do you like being human?

846
01:17:28,715 --> 01:17:30,478
It's all right.

847
01:17:30,517 --> 01:17:32,610
Better than being Altairian.

848
01:17:32,652 --> 01:17:36,315
Altairians are a filthy people.

849
01:17:36,356 --> 01:17:40,053
We could take over this place
if we wanted.

850
01:17:40,093 --> 01:17:42,527
They have nothing here
to stop us.

851
01:17:42,562 --> 01:17:44,792
Yo, hippy,
what kind of dude are you?

852
01:17:57,410 --> 01:17:59,378
OK, what's going on, man?

853
01:18:04,084 --> 01:18:05,551
Die!

854
01:18:31,211 --> 01:18:32,803
He's going to change soon.

855
01:18:32,846 --> 01:18:34,677
I'm going to be there.

856
01:18:36,316 --> 01:18:37,647
Who the hell are you?

857
01:18:39,252 --> 01:18:40,344
Do you feel pain?

858
01:18:40,387 --> 01:18:41,479
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

859
01:18:41,521 --> 01:18:43,682
Why didn't you use that thing?

860
01:18:43,723 --> 01:18:46,089
You said it's the only thing
that would kill him.

861
01:18:50,397 --> 01:18:52,228
Wrong composition.

862
01:18:53,233 --> 01:18:54,860
Doesn't work on human flesh.

863
01:19:15,322 --> 01:19:18,291
Hey, open up the door, man.

864
01:19:18,325 --> 01:19:21,123
He's from outer space.

865
01:19:21,161 --> 01:19:23,652
Nobody knows it. It's crazy.

866
01:19:23,697 --> 01:19:25,221
Something's going on.

867
01:19:28,735 --> 01:19:30,566
Dude's from outer space.

868
01:19:49,256 --> 01:19:50,746
Seal this off.

869
01:19:50,790 --> 01:19:53,054
Get back in there.

870
01:19:53,093 --> 01:19:54,583
Back.

871
01:19:57,364 --> 01:19:59,355
Cover me.

872
01:19:59,399 --> 01:20:00,798
You go low.

873
01:20:01,801 --> 01:20:03,359
On three.

874
01:20:03,403 --> 01:20:06,497
One.. two.. three.

875
01:20:06,539 --> 01:20:08,234
- Freeze!
- Don't shoot!

876
01:20:08,275 --> 01:20:09,674
Don't move!

877
01:20:09,709 --> 01:20:10,835
Freeze!

878
01:20:12,646 --> 01:20:14,307
- Is it him?
- No.

879
01:20:14,347 --> 01:20:15,837
Beck, what's going on?

880
01:20:17,684 --> 01:20:19,743
- Is he dead?
- Yeah.

881
01:20:19,786 --> 01:20:21,447
What's the hell is going on?

882
01:20:21,488 --> 01:20:23,422
Did anybody leave this room?

883
01:20:23,456 --> 01:20:25,151
I don't know.

884
01:20:25,191 --> 01:20:28,388
Willis. He said
he was going to get a medic.

885
01:20:28,428 --> 01:20:30,828
Beck, who did this to Masterson?

886
01:20:30,864 --> 01:20:34,391
- Not Willis.
- I'm sorry.

887
01:20:34,434 --> 01:20:36,425
I think we better find him.

888
01:20:50,884 --> 01:20:52,215
Senator Holt.

889
01:21:04,230 --> 01:21:06,596
What about
the Admiral Gray appointment?

890
01:21:12,138 --> 01:21:13,435
Where?

891
01:21:17,310 --> 01:21:18,743
Jesus Christ.

892
01:21:25,885 --> 01:21:28,718
And the free lunch program..

893
01:21:43,636 --> 01:21:45,866
Freeze!
Don't move!

894
01:21:45,905 --> 01:21:47,429
Hold it right there.

895
01:21:47,474 --> 01:21:48,566
Beck. LAPD.

896
01:21:48,608 --> 01:21:50,235
Who the hell's he?

897
01:21:50,276 --> 01:21:51,402
Gallagher. FBI.

898
01:21:51,444 --> 01:21:52,911
It's OK.
He's one of mine.

899
01:21:53,113 --> 01:21:54,205
What are you doing?

900
01:21:54,247 --> 01:21:55,548
Code red. Code red.

901
01:21:55,548 --> 01:21:57,778
Sir, there may be an assassin.

902
01:21:57,817 --> 01:22:00,115
We'll take you
out the back entrance.

903
01:22:03,690 --> 01:22:05,089
Detective Willis..

904
01:22:05,125 --> 01:22:07,389
I've got orders
to disarm and detain you.

905
01:22:08,461 --> 01:22:09,758
Sure.

906
01:22:19,539 --> 01:22:21,131
Get out of here now!

907
01:22:24,411 --> 01:22:27,278
All right. In here!
Move it! Move!

908
01:22:28,281 --> 01:22:30,374
Back against the wall now.

909
01:22:42,562 --> 01:22:44,291
Freeze!

910
01:23:49,329 --> 01:23:50,762
Oh, shit.

911
01:24:16,623 --> 01:24:18,523
They're in the kitchen.

912
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:22,584
Shit.

913
01:24:22,629 --> 01:24:25,598
Jim, stay with Beck.
Charlie, go with me.

914
01:24:25,632 --> 01:24:27,600
Three-L-ten, requesting
medical attention.

915
01:24:27,634 --> 01:24:29,101
I got two downed officers here.

916
01:24:30,770 --> 01:24:33,068
Freeze! Drop it!

917
01:24:36,643 --> 01:24:38,736
Both of you in the closet, now!

918
01:24:51,124 --> 01:24:53,092
Who are you?

919
01:24:55,495 --> 01:24:57,429
Who are you, God damn it?

920
01:24:59,799 --> 01:25:01,232
What do you want?

921
01:25:15,748 --> 01:25:18,717
Let's get the senator
out of here.

922
01:25:18,751 --> 01:25:20,275
All right.
Everybody move.

923
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:21,412
Get him out of here.

924
01:25:21,454 --> 01:25:22,580
Watch that guy.

925
01:25:36,536 --> 01:25:38,333
Uniform, seal this off.

926
01:25:58,524 --> 01:26:00,719
Hey, you can't go through here.

927
01:26:11,704 --> 01:26:13,433
Did we get him?

928
01:26:22,115 --> 01:26:23,605
Question.

929
01:26:23,650 --> 01:26:26,778
Was any motive established
for why Detective Willis..

930
01:26:26,819 --> 01:26:29,151
would want to assassinate
Senator Holt?

931
01:26:29,188 --> 01:26:30,348
Lieutenant Flynn?

932
01:26:31,724 --> 01:26:33,157
The depart..

933
01:26:33,192 --> 01:26:36,753
the department is conducting
an investigation..

934
01:26:36,796 --> 01:26:39,492
but at this time
we have no motive.

935
01:26:39,532 --> 01:26:41,100
Question.

936
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:42,226
Yes, sir.

937
01:26:42,268 --> 01:26:45,795
Senator, do you still intend
to run for president?

938
01:26:45,838 --> 01:26:48,170
The senator will discuss
his campaign plans..

939
01:26:48,207 --> 01:26:49,697
after he has had
adequate time..

940
01:26:49,742 --> 01:26:51,801
to fully reflect
on the situation.

941
01:26:51,844 --> 01:26:53,675
I want to be president.

942
01:26:53,713 --> 01:26:54,839
What's that, Senator?

943
01:26:59,419 --> 01:27:01,319
I want to be president.

944
01:27:23,443 --> 01:27:24,535
Gallagher. FBI.

945
01:27:24,577 --> 01:27:27,045
Mm-hmm.
What's in the bag?

946
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:28,741
Security equipment.

947
01:27:28,781 --> 01:27:30,442
Open it up.

948
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:35,312
All right. Go!

949
01:27:39,559 --> 01:27:41,584
Freeze!
Hold it! Freeze!

950
01:28:39,085 --> 01:28:40,609
Look!

951
01:29:45,184 --> 01:29:49,712
Mommy, is Daddy
going to be all right?

952
01:29:52,058 --> 01:29:54,754
You know, your daddy
loves you very much.

953
01:31:20,846 --> 01:31:23,406
Mom, take her
out of here, please.

954
01:31:26,152 --> 01:31:27,278
Nurse!

955
01:31:28,287 --> 01:31:30,847
Get a gurney.
Get an orderly. Stat!

956
01:32:57,700 --> 01:32:59,900
