3
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,604
What is your first name,
your last name?

4
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,988
My name is Yuri Zhary.

5
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,664
Where did you come from?

6
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:44,586
I came from Kharkov.

7
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,101
What school do you go to?

8
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:05,440
I go to a technical school.

9
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:12,489
Now we're going
to have a seance.

10
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:15,868
You just look at me.

11
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,833
Look me in the eye.

12
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,004
Look in front of you.

13
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,269
Turn around, with your back to me.

14
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:47,858
Concentrate on my hand.

15
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,986
My hand is drawing you back.

16
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,379
Spread your hands.

17
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:20,182
Concentrate. All your tension
is centered in your hands.

18
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:27,272
Your hands are strained!

19
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:32,069
Concentrate all of your
will power,

20
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,571
your big desire to win,
on your hands.

21
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:40,160
Your hands are getting
more and more tense.

22
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,663
They're very tense.
Still more tense.

23
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:50,212
Look at your fingers.
Your fingers are tense.

24
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:55,425
From here the tension passes on
to your fingers.

25
00:02:55,676 --> 00:03:00,389
Look at your hands.
Yura, concentrate!

26
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,728
On my count of three
your hands will become immobile.

27
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:15,445
One, two, three!
Your hands don't move.

28
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:17,781
You can't move them.

29
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,326
You're trying to move your hands,
but they're fixed.

30
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:26,915
It's very hard for you
to make a slightest movement.

31
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,501
Now I'm going to lift
this transfixion,

32
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:36,091
and you'll be able to speak
freely, easily and articulately.

33
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:44,016
From now on you will speak
loudly and clearly.

34
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,394
Look at me.

35
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:53,567
I'm lifting the tension
from your hands and your speech.

36
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:59,990
One, two, three!

37
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,536
Go ahead, say loudly and clearly:
I can speak!

38
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:10,792
MIRROR

56
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,711
The road from the station
passed through Ignatievo,

57
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:22,090
then swerved near the farm

58
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,927
we had lived on each summer
before the war,

59
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:29,389
and through a dense oak forest
went on as far as Tomshino.

60
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,228
Usually we spotted our people

61
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:38,148
as soon as they appeared from
behind a bush in the mid-field.

62
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:43,987
If he turned from the bush
towards our house, then it's father.

63
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:48,825
If not, it meant it was not father

64
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,787
and that father would never come.

65
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,179
Am I going the right way
to Tomshino?

66
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,558
You shouldn't have taken a turn
at the bush.

67
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:17,145
- And this... What's this?..
- What?

68
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:20,732
Why are you sitting here?

69
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:24,653
- I live here.
- Where? On the fence?

70
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,991
Are you interested in the way to
Tomshino or where I live?

71
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:36,206
I brought all the instruments,
but forgot the key.

72
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:41,503
Do you happen to have a nail
or a screw-driver?

73
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,048
I don't have any nails.

74
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,260
Why are you so nervous?

75
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:51,054
Give me your hand. I'm a doctor.

76
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,687
You're bothering me.

77
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,939
Do you want me to call my husband?

78
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:08,447
You haven't got any husband.
There's no ring.

79
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:17,623
Though people don't wear rings
nowadays. Maybe only old people.

80
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,590
May I have a cigarette?

81
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,984
Why do you look so sad?

82
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,871
And why do you look so happy?

83
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:01,875
It's a pleasure to fall down
with an attractive woman.

84
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:18,725
You know, I fell and found
strange things here - roots, bushes...

85
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,313
Has it ever occurred to you

86
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:31,655
that plants can feel, know,
even comprehend...

87
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:37,077
The trees, this hazel-nut bush...

88
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:40,205
- This is the alder-tree.
- It doesn't matter.

89
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,333
They don't run about.

90
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:49,047
Like us who are rushing, fussing,
uttering banalities.

91
00:09:55,888 --> 00:10:00,851
That's because we don't trust
nature that is inside us.

92
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:06,773
Always this suspiciousness,
haste,

93
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,444
and no time
to stop and think.

94
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,406
Look, you seem to be a bit...

95
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:19,620
It's no problem for me.
I'm a doctor.

96
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,333
And what about "Ward Number Six"?

97
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:28,587
Oh, Chekhov had made it all up!

98
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:38,222
Come to Tomshino sometime.
We often have a good time there.

99
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,057
You've got blood!

100
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:44,561
- Where?
- Behind your ear.

101
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,167
Each moment of our dates, not many,

102
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,295
We celebrated as an Epiphany.

103
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:54,715
Alone in the whole world.

104
00:11:55,174 --> 00:12:00,804
More daring and lighter
than a bird.

105
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:03,557
Down the stairs, like a dizzy
apparition,

106
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:06,852
You came to take me on your road,
Through rain-soaked lilacs,

107
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,063
To your own possession,
To the looking glass world.

108
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,608
As night descended

109
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:15,194
I was blessed with grace,

110
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,112
The altar gate opened up,

111
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:20,157
And in the darkness shining.

112
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:23,035
And slowly reclining
Was your body naked.

113
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:26,872
On waking up I said:
God bless you!

114
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,250
Although I knew how daring
and undue.

115
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:33,128
My blessing was: You were fast
asleep,

116
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:36,048
Your closed eyelids
with the universal blue.

117
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,383
The lilac on the table
so strained to sweep.

118
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:41,261
Touched by the blue, your lids.

119
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,932
Were quite serene, your hand was
warm.

120
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:49,019
And rivers pulsed in crystal slits,

121
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:52,481
Mountains smoked, and oceans
swarmed.

122
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,609
You held a sphere in your palm,

123
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,987
Of crystal; on your throne
you were sleeping calm.

124
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:02,491
And, oh my God! -
Belonging only to me,

125
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:05,327
You woke and at once transformed.

126
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:08,205
The language humans speak and think.

127
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,583
Speech rushed up sonorously formed,

128
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:15,337
With the word "you" so much
reformed.

129
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:19,258
As to evolve a new sense meaning
king.

130
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:22,302
And suddenly all changed,
like in a trance,

131
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:25,597
Even trivial things,
so often used and tried,

132
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,350
When standing 'tween us,
guarding us,

133
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:31,562
Was water, solid, stratified.

134
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:34,439
It carried us I don't know where.

135
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,484
Retreating before us, like some
mirage,

136
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:39,736
Were cities, miraculously fair.

137
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,156
Under our feet the mint grass spread,

138
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,659
The birds were following our tread,

139
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:48,954
The fishes came to a river bend,

140
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:51,915
And to our eyes the sky was open.

141
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:55,544
Behind us our fate was groping,

142
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:59,047
Like an insane man with a razor
in his hand.

143
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:11,101
Oh, good heavens! Dounya!

144
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:15,814
What is it, Pasha?!

145
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,705
A fire! But be quiet.

146
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:48,639
He'll get it coming to him!

147
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:53,936
And what if Vitya is in there?
What if he's burned?

148
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:57,189
Where's Klanya?

149
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:03,070
What?

150
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:07,528
Dad!

151
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:18,343
- Alexei?
- Hello, ma!

152
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:20,596
What's wrong with your voice?

153
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:24,391
Nothing serious.
I guess it's just a sore throat.

154
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,978
I haven't spoken to anyone
for three days.

155
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:32,399
I even liked it. I think it's good
to keep silent for a while.

156
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,444
Words can't express everything

157
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:39,698
a person feels.
Words are flaccid.

158
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:46,121
I just dreamed of you in my sleep.

159
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:48,207
As though I were still a child...

160
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:53,420
By the way, what year was it
when dad left us?

161
00:20:55,464 --> 00:20:59,343
1935. Why?

162
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:05,349
And the fire? Remember the hay-loft
that burned down at the farm?

163
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:08,644
That was in '35 too.

164
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:13,857
All right, stop pulling the wool
over my eyes.

165
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:17,653
You know... Lisa died.

166
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:27,579
The one I worked in the printing
house with.

167
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:33,836
- Oh God... When?
- This morning, at 7.

168
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:40,592
And what time is it now?
What is now?

169
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:43,554
- Almost six.
- In the morning?

170
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:46,515
What's the matter with you?
In the evening.

171
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:51,979
Mom, why do we have to fight
all the time?

172
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:55,566
I'm sorry if I did anything wrong.

173
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,468
Printing-house.
Next stop: Serpukhovskaya.

174
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,924
What's the rush?

175
00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:57,479
Hello.

176
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:02,234
Where're the proofs
I've been reading?

177
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:06,947
I don't know. Just a minute.

178
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,704
Yelizaveta Pavlovna is here.

179
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:23,797
Marousia, what's wrong?

180
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,053
Something in yesterday's proofs?

181
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:34,725
In the Goslit edition?
Don't be so nervous!

182
00:24:35,726 --> 00:24:37,769
We should look in the typesetting
case.

183
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,356
Nothing terrible has happened.

184
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:57,498
It's such an important edition!

185
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:04,796
Although misprints have no place
in any edition.

186
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:07,508
Shut up, you idiot.

187
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:13,198
- What happened?
- Nothing serious.

188
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:18,745
I just want to check something.
I may be wrong...

189
00:26:19,997 --> 00:26:22,040
Let's start from the beginning.

190
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:24,918
I'd rather do it myself.

191
00:26:25,127 --> 00:26:28,213
Everybody's rushing,
no one's got any time!

192
00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:37,181
You think I'm afraid?

193
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:39,975
No, let other people
be afraid.

194
00:26:40,184 --> 00:26:43,770
Some people should work,
and others should be afraid.

195
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:04,791
Well, nothing awful has happened.

196
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:07,920
If it happened, it happened.
We've been printing all night...

197
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:25,372
I waited for you since yesterday's
morning.

198
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:28,667
That you won't come they probably
guessed.

199
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:31,545
Remember what a beautiful weather
it was?

200
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:34,923
A holiday weather!
And I walked coatless.

201
00:28:35,632 --> 00:28:38,385
Today you're here, and they have
arranged.

202
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,597
An utterly gloomy and cloudy day,

203
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:44,892
It rains, and it's getting unusually
late,

204
00:28:45,392 --> 00:28:48,896
The rain drops run down the cold
terrain,

205
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:53,775
Unsoothable by word, unwipable
by hand...

206
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:24,264
You see, it wasn't there, was it?
Everything is all right.

207
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:29,228
It wasn't...
That would've been a horrid mistake.

208
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:31,396
Why are you crying then?

209
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:38,278
I even saw that word typeset.

210
00:29:38,487 --> 00:29:39,738
What word?

211
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:00,342
Great!

212
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:10,602
This is pure alcohol.
Not much, but it might help.

213
00:30:11,937 --> 00:30:15,357
You've got all drenched up.
You look like a scarecrow!

214
00:30:15,566 --> 00:30:19,027
Really, I'm all wet.

215
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:26,827
I guess I'll go and take a shower.
Where's my comb?

216
00:30:28,078 --> 00:30:31,456
You know who you resemble now?

217
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:35,627
- Who?
- Maria Timofeyevna.

218
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:37,504
What Maria Timofeyevna?

219
00:30:40,174 --> 00:30:43,260
Here. You've been looking for
your comb, haven't you?

220
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:49,683
Tell me, who's Maria Timofeyevna?

221
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:57,774
There was such a woman,
Captain Lebyadkin's sister.

222
00:30:59,735 --> 00:31:03,572
You're the spitting image
of Lebyadkina.

223
00:31:03,989 --> 00:31:08,118
In what way do I resemble her?

224
00:31:10,162 --> 00:31:14,958
Yes, Fyodor Mikhailovich was...
Whatever you may say...

225
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:16,710
What?

226
00:31:17,211 --> 00:31:20,255
Lebyadkin, bring some water!

227
00:31:20,506 --> 00:31:27,137
The difference is her brother would
not bring her water, but beat her.

228
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:30,349
Explain it. I don't understand.

229
00:31:31,475 --> 00:31:35,479
All your life is just that
"bring some water!"

230
00:31:37,523 --> 00:31:39,566
Just an appearance of independence.

231
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:41,985
If something doesn't suit you,

232
00:31:42,194 --> 00:31:46,156
you pretend
it doesn't exist.

233
00:31:47,074 --> 00:31:49,201
What nonsense you're talking!

234
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:52,162
I'm amazed at the patience
of your ex-husband.

235
00:31:52,371 --> 00:31:56,583
He should have run away
much sooner.

236
00:31:56,792 --> 00:31:58,418
What do you want from me?

237
00:31:58,627 --> 00:32:02,506
Have you ever admitted
you were wrong? Never!

238
00:32:02,714 --> 00:32:07,261
You just made up
this whole situation!

239
00:32:08,887 --> 00:32:13,809
As long as you haven't succeeded
in elevating your dear husband

240
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:18,856
to this nonsensical emancipated
condition of yours,

241
00:32:19,064 --> 00:32:21,358
then you can be sure
he has been saved just in time.

242
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:26,738
As for your children, you will
definitely make them miserable.

243
00:32:37,457 --> 00:32:39,501
Stop this idiocy!

244
00:33:13,035 --> 00:33:16,788
Come on now, Masha!

245
00:33:20,584 --> 00:33:22,628
Leave me alone!

246
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:31,553
My earthly life traversed but
by a half,

247
00:33:32,137 --> 00:33:34,973
I found myself lost in a twilight
forest...

248
00:34:38,704 --> 00:34:44,251
I always said
that you resemble my mother.

249
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:46,628
Apparently, that's the reason
we divorced.

250
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:52,134
I notice with horror how much
Ignat is becoming like you.

251
00:34:52,342 --> 00:34:55,846
Why with horror?

252
00:34:56,054 --> 00:35:00,017
We two could never talk
like normal human beings.

253
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:07,774
When I recall my childhood
and my mother,

254
00:35:07,983 --> 00:35:12,112
somehow she always has your face.

255
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:16,533
I know why though.

256
00:35:17,534 --> 00:35:22,080
I pity you both,
you and her.

257
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:23,749
Why?

258
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:27,211
Ignat, put the glass down!

259
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:36,970
You won't be able to live
a normal life with anyone.

260
00:35:37,179 --> 00:35:38,931
Probably.

261
00:35:39,765 --> 00:35:44,853
Don't feel offended.
You seem to be convinced

262
00:35:45,938 --> 00:35:49,024
that the very fact
of your existence close by

263
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:51,652
will make everybody happy.

264
00:35:52,027 --> 00:35:53,654
You only know how to demand.

265
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:57,991
That's because I was brought up
by women.

266
00:35:58,784 --> 00:36:01,787
If you don't want Ignat
to become like that,

267
00:36:02,037 --> 00:36:04,081
get married as soon as possible.

268
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:08,752
- Get married to whom?
- This I don't know.

269
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,964
Or give Ignat to me.

270
00:36:17,469 --> 00:36:21,181
Why didn't you make it up with
your mother? It was your fault.

271
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,102
What fault?

272
00:36:26,436 --> 00:36:29,523
She's convinced herself she knows
better than I how I should live.

273
00:36:29,898 --> 00:36:32,901
That she can make me happy.

274
00:36:35,404 --> 00:36:41,243
As far as mother is concerned,
I can feel it better than you.

275
00:36:42,161 --> 00:36:44,371
What can you feel better?

276
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,249
That we're getting more and more
distant,

277
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,711
and I can't do anything
about it.

278
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,695
Natalya, try to distract him.
He's talking of Spain again.

279
00:37:16,904 --> 00:37:19,156
It will end up in a scandal.

280
00:37:24,036 --> 00:37:28,165
I wanted to ask you for a favor...
We're redecorating now.

281
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:34,254
Ignat wants to live with you
for a week.

282
00:37:34,463 --> 00:37:36,965
I will be very happy.

283
00:38:16,088 --> 00:38:17,714
What does he say?

284
00:38:17,923 --> 00:38:21,093
He's showing the great matador
Palomo Linares.

285
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:55,002
Most of all he was excited
by the farewell he was given.

286
00:38:57,379 --> 00:39:00,299
The whole town came to see him off.
People sang and danced.

287
00:39:00,674 --> 00:39:03,427
His mother couldn't come,
she was sick.

288
00:39:04,303 --> 00:39:10,726
And his father stood aside,
sad and silent.

289
00:39:11,685 --> 00:39:15,814
He knew they were thinking
the same thing:

290
00:39:16,064 --> 00:39:18,692
that they probably will never
see each other again.

291
00:39:37,503 --> 00:39:38,962
Are you mocking at us or what?

292
00:39:40,297 --> 00:39:43,383
We taught you and taught
and it was no use.

293
00:39:43,592 --> 00:39:45,636
Now it turns out you can!

294
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:53,268
He went to Spain and didn't
understand anything.

295
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:59,358
Did you ever want
to go back to Spain?

296
00:40:00,025 --> 00:40:04,154
I can't go, I've got a Russian
husband.

297
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:07,032
And Russian children.

298
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:21,004
I'll talk to her myself!

299
00:44:19,201 --> 00:44:20,285
Ignat!

300
00:44:24,498 --> 00:44:26,208
Come here. I'm leaving.

301
00:44:45,644 --> 00:44:48,021
Always in a hurry...

302
00:44:49,273 --> 00:44:51,483
Don't put it together, just give it
to me like that.

303
00:45:02,578 --> 00:45:08,250
- Oh, I felt an electric shock.
- What shock?

304
00:45:13,172 --> 00:45:16,091
As if it had already happened...

305
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:26,435
But I've never been here before.

306
00:45:33,692 --> 00:45:37,029
Come on, give me the money
and stop dreaming.

307
00:45:42,826 --> 00:45:47,998
Clean up a bit,
make the place tidy.

308
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:15,108
Don't touch anything here.

309
00:46:15,901 --> 00:46:19,446
If Maria Nikolaevna comes
tell her to wait for me.

310
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:36,296
Come in. How are you?

311
00:46:41,969 --> 00:46:45,055
May we have another cup
for the young man?

312
00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:11,039
Take the notebook from the third
shelf in the bookcase, will you?

313
00:47:19,339 --> 00:47:22,676
Read from the page that is marked
with a ribbon.

314
00:47:29,683 --> 00:47:36,273
"To the question how sciences
and arts affect

315
00:47:36,482 --> 00:47:39,401
people's morals, Rousseau answered:
Negatively'."

316
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:44,781
Read only what is underlined
with the red pencil.

317
00:47:45,741 --> 00:47:49,369
"Notwithstanding the..."
Oh no!

318
00:47:50,454 --> 00:47:55,292
"The division of churches
separated us from Europe."

319
00:47:55,751 --> 00:47:57,794
We remained excluded

320
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:05,093
from every great event
that had shaken it.

321
00:48:05,677 --> 00:48:10,641
However, we had our own,
special destiny.

322
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:14,937
Russia, with her immense territory,

323
00:48:15,395 --> 00:48:17,773
had swallowed up the Mongol
invasion.

324
00:48:18,148 --> 00:48:25,072
The Tartars didn't dare
crossing our western borders.

325
00:48:26,323 --> 00:48:28,575
They retreated to their wilderness

326
00:48:28,784 --> 00:48:31,954
and Christian civilization
had been saved.

327
00:48:33,705 --> 00:48:37,334
To attain that goal
we had to lead

328
00:48:38,252 --> 00:48:43,173
a special kind of life
which, while leaving us Christians,

329
00:48:43,882 --> 00:48:48,262
had made us alien
to the Christian world.

330
00:48:49,888 --> 00:48:53,058
As for our historic
insignificance,

331
00:48:53,267 --> 00:48:55,769
I cannot agree with you on that.

332
00:48:55,978 --> 00:49:00,774
Don't you find
anything significant at all

333
00:49:01,108 --> 00:49:03,402
in today's situation in Russia

334
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:06,697
that would strike
a future historian?

335
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:12,161
Although I'm heartily attached
to our sovereign,

336
00:49:12,911 --> 00:49:18,000
I'm not at all delighted with
everything I see around me.

337
00:49:19,251 --> 00:49:25,465
As a man of letters,
I'm being annoyed, insulted,

338
00:49:25,841 --> 00:49:31,054
but I swear that for nothing
in the world would have made me

339
00:49:31,263 --> 00:49:34,683
change my home country
or have any other history

340
00:49:34,892 --> 00:49:37,102
than the history of our forbears,

341
00:49:37,311 --> 00:49:39,897
"such as it was given us by God."

342
00:49:40,564 --> 00:49:46,487
From Pushkin's letter to Chaadayev.
October 19, 1836.

343
00:49:52,367 --> 00:49:54,161
Go, open up.

344
00:50:11,845 --> 00:50:14,139
I'm afraid I've got the wrong
address.

345
00:51:18,287 --> 00:51:20,873
Ignat, how are you doing?

346
00:51:22,916 --> 00:51:24,960
Did Maria Nikolaevna come?

347
00:51:25,169 --> 00:51:30,424
No. Though some woman came,
but she's got the wrong apartment.

348
00:51:30,632 --> 00:51:37,472
Find something to do
or invite somebody.

349
00:51:38,015 --> 00:51:40,517
Do you know any girls?

350
00:51:40,809 --> 00:51:43,979
You mean from my class?
Oh no!

351
00:51:44,271 --> 00:51:48,942
At your age I was already in love...
During the war...

352
00:51:50,194 --> 00:51:55,199
With a redhead...
Her lips were always blistered.

353
00:51:56,283 --> 00:51:58,994
Our military instructor was chasing
after her, he was shell-shocked.

354
00:52:01,038 --> 00:52:02,581
Are you listening to me?

355
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:12,442
What did you fire at?
You think I didn't see it?

356
00:53:15,946 --> 00:53:18,699
You were firing up!

357
00:53:18,991 --> 00:53:23,203
What's wrong with that?
There's no one there.

358
00:53:23,412 --> 00:53:25,038
And what if somebody was there?

359
00:53:26,832 --> 00:53:28,500
There're only trees there.

360
00:53:28,709 --> 00:53:30,752
And what if somebody climbed a tree?

361
00:53:33,922 --> 00:53:39,469
About face! I commanded
"about face"!

362
00:53:40,721 --> 00:53:44,600
Put down your rifle.

363
00:53:45,058 --> 00:53:47,186
That's what I did.

364
00:53:47,769 --> 00:53:52,649
Did you learn drill regulations?

365
00:53:55,235 --> 00:54:01,200
About face in Russian means
exactly what I did.

366
00:54:01,742 --> 00:54:08,665
About face means a turn of
360 degrees.

367
00:54:09,833 --> 00:54:15,172
What degrees? About face!

368
00:54:25,557 --> 00:54:29,061
To the firing position
forward march!

369
00:54:34,858 --> 00:54:37,486
I'm going to send you
for your parents.

370
00:54:38,487 --> 00:54:40,364
What parents?

371
00:54:42,866 --> 00:54:44,993
You'll know very soon
what parents.

372
00:54:48,747 --> 00:54:51,750
What is the firing position?

373
00:54:52,042 --> 00:54:54,378
Down on the floor mat!

374
00:54:54,586 --> 00:54:57,506
His parents died during the siege.

375
00:55:03,595 --> 00:55:08,100
The firing position is...
a firing position.

376
00:55:13,689 --> 00:55:15,732
- Markov!
- Yes, sir!

377
00:55:17,526 --> 00:55:19,987
Name the basic elements of...

378
00:55:24,741 --> 00:55:26,785
The rifle.

379
00:55:43,594 --> 00:55:45,012
The butt.

380
00:55:48,807 --> 00:55:51,977
- The muzzle.
- It's you who's a muzzle.

381
00:56:04,364 --> 00:56:06,408
What is the muzzle then?

382
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:37,773
Guys! A grenade!

383
00:56:45,697 --> 00:56:48,617
It's a hand grenade!

384
00:57:01,171 --> 00:57:02,714
Don't do it!

385
00:57:03,674 --> 00:57:05,551
Down on the ground!

386
00:57:05,801 --> 00:57:07,636
You'll be killed!

387
00:57:46,466 --> 00:57:48,135
It's only a dummy grenade.

388
00:58:08,697 --> 00:58:13,410
And you say you're from Leningrad
and been under the siege...

389
01:01:12,923 --> 01:01:16,426
I don't believe in premonitions.

390
01:01:16,635 --> 01:01:20,430
I have no trust in superstitions.

391
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:23,892
I don't run from slander or venom.

392
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:26,061
There's no death on earth.

393
01:01:26,436 --> 01:01:29,189
All are immortal,
Everything's immortal.

394
01:01:29,398 --> 01:01:32,067
Don't be afraid of death
at seventeen,

395
01:01:32,276 --> 01:01:35,904
At seventy as well...
There's just reality and light.

396
01:01:36,446 --> 01:01:39,533
There's neither death nor darkness
in this world.

397
01:01:39,992 --> 01:01:42,411
At last we all have reached the shore,

398
01:01:43,036 --> 01:01:45,706
And I'm the one who casts a fishing
rod.

399
01:01:45,914 --> 01:01:48,333
When immortality is coming
in a shoal.

400
01:01:48,792 --> 01:01:51,962
Live in a house, and it'll never
fall.

401
01:01:52,462 --> 01:01:54,840
To any of the centuries I'd nod.

402
01:01:55,132 --> 01:01:57,885
And enter it, a house I'd install.

403
01:01:58,427 --> 01:02:01,013
That's why with me your children
share board,

404
01:02:01,305 --> 01:02:03,682
Your wives join me at my table,
and all.

405
01:02:04,099 --> 01:02:07,186
One table serves both granddad and
grandchild:

406
01:02:07,561 --> 01:02:10,314
The future's being made right now.

407
01:02:10,689 --> 01:02:13,233
Whenever I'm to raise my hand
in tide,

408
01:02:13,567 --> 01:02:16,361
I all five rays of it on you bestow.

409
01:02:16,945 --> 01:02:19,948
With collarbones, as if with
timber work,

410
01:02:20,157 --> 01:02:22,743
I propped up every day of past age.

411
01:02:23,118 --> 01:02:25,954
I measured time by a world-wide
walk,

412
01:02:26,163 --> 01:02:28,999
I passed through it like through
the Urals range.

413
01:02:29,208 --> 01:02:31,752
I chose the age up to my own measure.

414
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:35,672
We headed south, with dust flying
away,

415
01:02:36,048 --> 01:02:38,800
The weeds smoked up, and at his own
leisure,

416
01:02:39,009 --> 01:02:41,512
His feeler on the horseshoe,
the grasshopper forecast...

417
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:44,806
He prophesied me death, as if
he were a monk.

418
01:02:45,015 --> 01:02:47,935
But with my fate strapped to my
saddle fast,

419
01:02:48,143 --> 01:02:50,771
I'm riding now in the time to come.

420
01:02:50,979 --> 01:02:53,398
And surging on the stirrups to my
own drum.

421
01:02:54,066 --> 01:02:56,693
My immortality is quite enough
for me.

422
01:02:57,194 --> 01:03:00,072
For my own blood to flow ages
through,

423
01:03:00,489 --> 01:03:03,116
For steady warmth and a haven
safe and true

424
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:05,911
I'd give my life self-willingly and
freely,

425
01:03:06,119 --> 01:03:08,872
Had not its volatile, needle-like
sword.

426
01:03:09,081 --> 01:03:12,000
Been leading me, like a thread,
throughout the world.

427
01:06:27,446 --> 01:06:31,325
Marousia? And the children?

428
01:06:34,745 --> 01:06:35,996
Where are the children?

429
01:06:39,833 --> 01:06:43,212
I'm going to tell everybody
that you've stolen the book.

430
01:06:45,547 --> 01:06:49,218
- What?
- I will, you'll see.

431
01:06:52,221 --> 01:06:58,101
- Now stop it!
- Go on, tell everybody!

432
01:06:58,310 --> 01:07:01,730
I will, anyway!

433
01:07:06,985 --> 01:07:09,112
Marina!

434
01:08:32,237 --> 01:08:35,324
You could have come more often.
You know that he's missing you.

435
01:08:38,577 --> 01:08:46,084
Let Ignat live with me.

436
01:08:50,672 --> 01:08:52,257
Are you serious?

437
01:08:52,674 --> 01:08:56,595
You said yourself
that he would like to.

438
01:08:58,222 --> 01:09:00,432
With you it's better to keep one's
mouth shut.

439
01:09:00,808 --> 01:09:04,603
You mean I'm inventing this
for my own pleasure?

440
01:09:05,687 --> 01:09:09,483
Let's ask him.
Whatever he decides...

441
01:09:10,484 --> 01:09:12,528
Besides, it will make your life
much easier.

442
01:09:14,196 --> 01:09:15,906
Why would this make it easier for me?

443
01:09:21,161 --> 01:09:22,830
Have you collected your books?

444
01:09:25,582 --> 01:09:27,459
Go say goodbye to your father.

445
01:09:30,212 --> 01:09:34,758
Your mother and I would like
to ask you...

446
01:09:35,843 --> 01:09:37,010
What?

447
01:09:41,056 --> 01:09:43,517
Wouldn't it be better if you lived
with me?

448
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:45,269
How?

449
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:52,151
You and I will live together.
Haven't you said so to your mother?

450
01:09:53,110 --> 01:09:58,198
Said what? When?
No, please.

451
01:10:31,607 --> 01:10:33,942
We really look alike,
don't we?

452
01:10:34,818 --> 01:10:36,528
Not at all!

453
01:10:55,672 --> 01:10:58,884
What do you want from your mother?
What kind of relationship?

454
01:11:04,473 --> 01:11:07,810
The kind of relationship you had
in your childhood is impossible.

455
01:11:17,402 --> 01:11:22,491
You speak of some feeling of
guilt,

456
01:11:22,699 --> 01:11:24,743
of her life being ruined because of
you...

457
01:11:26,203 --> 01:11:28,413
Well, you can't get away from it.

458
01:11:31,041 --> 01:11:34,753
And what she needs is for you
to become a baby again,

459
01:11:34,962 --> 01:11:38,590
for her to be able to carry you
and protect you.

460
01:11:41,844 --> 01:11:46,849
Why on earth am I meddling in it?

461
01:11:48,433 --> 01:11:49,852
It's always like this...

462
01:12:01,196 --> 01:12:03,949
Why are you whimpering?
Explain it.

463
01:12:06,785 --> 01:12:09,496
Should I marry him or not?

464
01:12:16,753 --> 01:12:21,675
- Do I know him?
- No...

465
01:12:22,926 --> 01:12:24,386
Is he Ukrainian?

466
01:12:24,928 --> 01:12:26,889
Does it matter?

467
01:12:28,307 --> 01:12:33,228
- What is he doing?
- He is a writer.

468
01:12:35,439 --> 01:12:38,025
Doesn't his name happen to be
Dostoyevsky?

469
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,818
Yes, Dostoyevsky.

470
01:12:42,029 --> 01:12:45,407
He hasn't written anything
worthwhile. Nobody knows him.

471
01:12:46,116 --> 01:12:49,203
He must be about 40, isn't he?
Apparently he's got no talent?

472
01:12:52,748 --> 01:12:56,251
You've changed so much.

473
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:02,758
So, he has no talent, he doesn't write
anything.

474
01:13:03,008 --> 01:13:05,052
He does write, but they don't
publish him.

475
01:13:07,763 --> 01:13:11,725
Look, our precious flunk
has put something on fire.

476
01:13:15,687 --> 01:13:18,398
No need to be so ironic about
his flunking.

477
01:13:18,649 --> 01:13:21,109
If he doesn't finish school,
he'll end up being drafted.

478
01:13:21,318 --> 01:13:24,863
And you will go begging
to have him exempted from the army.

479
01:13:27,157 --> 01:13:29,618
This is all the result of your
indulging him.

480
01:13:29,827 --> 01:13:33,622
By the way, the army would be
good for him.

481
01:13:33,831 --> 01:13:35,707
Why don't you call your mother?

482
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:39,086
After Aunt Lisa's death she stayed
in bed for three days.

483
01:13:39,503 --> 01:13:45,509
Wasn't she supposed to come here
at five?

484
01:13:48,178 --> 01:13:50,931
Is it so difficult
to make the first move?

485
01:13:51,723 --> 01:13:54,059
We were talking about Ignat.

486
01:13:57,563 --> 01:13:59,606
It may be my fault, too.

487
01:14:03,402 --> 01:14:05,612
Or is it because we got so bourgeois?

488
01:14:07,114 --> 01:14:14,037
And our embourgeoisement is
so dense, so Asian.

489
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:17,666
With private ownership nonexistent,
our well-being is on the rise.

490
01:14:18,083 --> 01:14:19,751
Nothing makes any sense anymore.

491
01:14:20,043 --> 01:14:22,004
Why do you get so irritated?

492
01:14:22,337 --> 01:14:25,924
I know a family
whose 15-year-old son said:

493
01:14:26,133 --> 01:14:28,468
"I'm leaving you.
It disgusts me to see

494
01:14:28,677 --> 01:14:30,888
how you weasel around
trying to please everybody."

495
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:34,266
Good boy.
Not like our booby.

496
01:14:37,102 --> 01:14:39,563
Unfortunately, our boy would never
say such a thing.

497
01:14:39,771 --> 01:14:42,024
I can imagine that family of yours!

498
01:14:42,483 --> 01:14:47,321
They're no worse than we are.
He works for a newspaper.

499
01:14:48,322 --> 01:14:51,116
And thinks he's a writer, too.

500
01:14:56,830 --> 01:14:58,540
Though he's unable to understand

501
01:14:58,749 --> 01:15:01,627
that a book is not a way of making
money but a statement.

502
01:15:03,587 --> 01:15:06,423
A poet is called upon
to provoke a spiritual jolt

503
01:15:06,632 --> 01:15:08,675
and not to cultivate idolaters.

504
01:15:17,059 --> 01:15:19,978
What am I going to do?

505
01:15:20,896 --> 01:15:23,732
You're going to get married.

506
01:15:24,107 --> 01:15:28,487
Do you happen to remember
who was it who saw a bush on fire?

507
01:15:29,404 --> 01:15:31,031
I mean the angel as a bush?

508
01:15:32,115 --> 01:15:35,953
I don't remember.
In any case, it was not Ignat.

509
01:15:37,246 --> 01:15:39,790
Maybe we should send him
to a cadet school?

510
01:15:40,874 --> 01:15:46,922
An angel as a flame coming from
a bush appeared to Prophet Moses.

511
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,634
He led his people out across the sea.

512
01:15:51,218 --> 01:15:54,304
Why has nothing like that
ever appeared to me?

513
01:16:06,942 --> 01:16:12,114
With an amazing regularity
I keep seeing one and the same dream.

514
01:16:14,575 --> 01:16:18,996
It seems to make me return

515
01:16:20,414 --> 01:16:22,457
to the place, poignantly dear to my
heart,

516
01:16:22,666 --> 01:16:25,043
where my grandfather's house
used to be,

517
01:16:26,503 --> 01:16:34,261
in which I was born 40 years ago
right on the dinner table.

518
01:16:36,763 --> 01:16:40,684
Each time I try to enter it, something
prevents me from doing that.

519
01:16:43,437 --> 01:16:46,773
I see this dream again and again.

520
01:16:50,569 --> 01:16:56,533
And when I see those walls made of
logs and the dark entrance,

521
01:16:57,242 --> 01:17:00,579
even in my dream I become aware
that I'm only dreaming it.

522
01:17:01,788 --> 01:17:08,253
And the overwhelming joy is clouded
by anticipation of awakening.

523
01:17:12,132 --> 01:17:15,302
At times something happens
and I stop dreaming

524
01:17:15,511 --> 01:17:19,264
of the house and the pine trees
of my childhood around it.

525
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,811
Then I get depressed.

526
01:17:26,021 --> 01:17:29,900
And I can't wait to see
this dream

527
01:17:31,318 --> 01:17:34,071
in which I'll be a child again

528
01:17:35,405 --> 01:17:38,033
and feel happy again

529
01:17:39,201 --> 01:17:44,998
because everything will be still
ahead, everything will be possible...

530
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:36,175
Mommy!

531
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:52,519
- Mom, they opened up!
- What's the matter with you?

532
01:20:59,776 --> 01:21:01,195
Hello.

533
01:21:04,907 --> 01:21:05,991
Hello.

534
01:21:15,667 --> 01:21:19,963
- Are you Nadezhda Petrovna?
- I don't think I...

535
01:21:20,172 --> 01:21:23,467
I'm Matvey Ivanov's stepdaughter.

536
01:21:24,802 --> 01:21:26,929
He was a friend of your husband.

537
01:21:27,846 --> 01:21:30,933
What Matvey?

538
01:21:31,141 --> 01:21:35,354
The doctor. He used to live here.

539
01:21:35,562 --> 01:21:40,484
Then he moved to Yurievets
and became a legal expert.

540
01:21:43,737 --> 01:21:46,490
Are you from town?

541
01:21:46,698 --> 01:21:49,785
We're from Moscow,
but we have a room in Yurievets.

542
01:21:56,583 --> 01:21:59,837
We were evacuated last fall.

543
01:22:01,713 --> 01:22:05,926
The air raids on Moscow began
and I have two kids.

544
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:09,138
My mother has some old connections
here...

545
01:22:13,725 --> 01:22:17,229
My husband is not here,
he's in town.

546
01:22:22,484 --> 01:22:25,154
Stop scratching yourself!

547
01:22:25,863 --> 01:22:29,575
Actually I came to see you.
It's a ladies' little secret.

548
01:22:36,373 --> 01:22:40,002
Come on in.
Don't stand there...

549
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:50,179
Wipe your feet.
Masha's just washed the floor.

550
01:23:15,662 --> 01:23:20,584
Sit here for a while.
We won't be long.

551
01:27:34,505 --> 01:27:38,634
Why are you sitting in the dark?
Did it go out?

552
01:27:40,844 --> 01:27:42,888
You should've called us.

553
01:27:45,390 --> 01:27:48,101
- What's your name?
- Alyosha.

554
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:54,983
I've got a son, too.
Not so big as you, of course.

555
01:27:55,567 --> 01:27:58,737
It's not easy having kids now,
with the war going.

556
01:27:59,613 --> 01:28:02,115
I wish I had a girl too.

557
01:28:02,741 --> 01:28:05,410
Want to have a look? He's asleep.

558
01:28:06,161 --> 01:28:09,081
We'll be quiet.
He's such a darling.

559
01:28:55,252 --> 01:28:58,088
The other day he asked his father:

560
01:28:58,797 --> 01:29:02,593
"Why is 5 kopecks bigger
than 10 kopecks?"

561
01:29:03,135 --> 01:29:08,307
I was just dumfounded, and
his father didn't know what to say.

562
01:29:09,850 --> 01:29:14,938
He always wanted a daughter.
He even thought of a girl's name.

563
01:29:16,356 --> 01:29:21,195
And I prepared a pink layette.

564
01:29:22,446 --> 01:29:24,490
Then I had to make everything anew.

565
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:29,536
He put us up to a lot of trouble,
little rascal.

566
01:29:32,539 --> 01:29:34,833
We woke you up, didn't we?

567
01:29:35,042 --> 01:29:38,837
That's your mommy's fault,
she just can't stop talking.

568
01:29:39,296 --> 01:29:44,384
See, we've got company.
Some strangers, aren't they?

569
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:50,015
You just wouldn't wake up,
would you?

570
01:29:50,849 --> 01:29:55,229
All right, honey, go back to sleep.

571
01:30:04,947 --> 01:30:09,243
Do they become me? And the ring?

572
01:30:10,327 --> 01:30:14,873
- What's wrong?
- I just felt queasy.

573
01:30:15,791 --> 01:30:19,670
Of course, you've made a long trip.
I should have known better.

574
01:30:20,128 --> 01:30:22,965
Have a drink. It will warm you up.

575
01:30:26,135 --> 01:30:31,056
I just talk and talk
when I ought to make supper.

576
01:30:31,515 --> 01:30:34,351
Oh please, you don't have to do it.

577
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:40,440
- But I can't let you go like that.
- We had a meal before leaving.

578
01:30:41,066 --> 01:30:43,569
I don't like his cough!

579
01:30:45,946 --> 01:30:48,407
Well, he runs wild...

580
01:30:48,657 --> 01:30:52,786
We must have my husband
examine him.

581
01:30:53,245 --> 01:30:57,541
We can't wait, we have a two-hour
walk to make.

582
01:30:57,749 --> 01:31:01,712
And what about the earrings?
My husband's got the money.

583
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:06,341
We're going to have a cock
slaughtered. Only may I ask you...

584
01:31:07,301 --> 01:31:11,013
I'm three months pregnant
and having fits of sickness.

585
01:31:11,221 --> 01:31:14,057
Even when I'm milking a cow,
it gets so bad...

586
01:31:14,808 --> 01:31:19,521
As for the cock...
Could you?

587
01:31:21,815 --> 01:31:23,442
Well, I myself...

588
01:31:25,235 --> 01:31:26,570
What, you too?

589
01:31:27,029 --> 01:31:31,366
No, but I've never done it before.

590
01:31:31,575 --> 01:31:36,038
Oh, it's nothing. Sure, in Moscow
you ate them already slaughtered.

591
01:31:39,374 --> 01:31:42,711
I usually do it right here,
on this little log.

592
01:31:43,545 --> 01:31:46,799
Here's the axe. My husband
has sharpened it this morning.

593
01:31:47,549 --> 01:31:50,803
- You mean, right in the room?
- We'll put a basin under.

594
01:31:51,011 --> 01:31:56,016
And tomorrow you'll take
a chicken with you.

595
01:31:56,225 --> 01:31:57,684
No, I can't.

596
01:31:58,393 --> 01:32:03,065
Maybe we'll ask Alyosha to do that?
After all, he's a man.

597
01:32:05,275 --> 01:32:07,069
Why Alyosha?

598
01:32:07,528 --> 01:32:13,742
All right, hold it tight. If it breaks
loose, it'll smash the dishes.

599
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:29,550
Oh no, I don't feel... Well?

600
01:33:18,974 --> 01:33:23,979
Calm down. Everything will be
all right.

601
01:33:25,481 --> 01:33:27,107
I wish I could see you

602
01:33:27,316 --> 01:33:30,027
not only when I feel too bad.

603
01:33:31,737 --> 01:33:34,198
- Do you hear me?
- Yes.

604
01:33:41,205 --> 01:33:42,998
At last I soared up.

605
01:33:43,207 --> 01:33:45,959
What's wrong, Marousia?
You feel bad?

606
01:33:46,168 --> 01:33:52,382
Don't be surprised.
I love you.

607
01:33:53,967 --> 01:33:58,972
Are you leaving already? And the
earrings? My husband'll be right here.

608
01:33:59,181 --> 01:34:03,143
- He's got the money.
- We changed our mind.

609
01:34:03,352 --> 01:34:07,147
It's fifteen versts to the town.
It's going to be dark soon.

610
01:34:07,356 --> 01:34:09,399
That's all right, don't worry.

611
01:34:22,663 --> 01:34:26,333
A man has but one body,
Like a single cell.

612
01:34:26,542 --> 01:34:29,753
The soul is sick and tired
Of its too solid shell,

613
01:34:29,962 --> 01:34:33,132
With ears, mouth, eyes
The size of a nickel coin.

614
01:34:33,423 --> 01:34:37,803
And skin all scarred and diced,
Spread over a skeleton.

615
01:34:38,137 --> 01:34:41,723
Through cornea it wings
To a heavenly spring,

616
01:34:41,932 --> 01:34:45,894
To ice-laden slings,
To a chariot birds bring.

617
01:34:46,103 --> 01:34:49,648
It hears through the grating
Of its living prison pen.

618
01:34:50,023 --> 01:34:54,486
The fields' and forests' rattling,
The Seven Seas' refrain.

619
01:34:55,070 --> 01:34:59,533
Without body a soul's nude,
As a body's nude without a shirt:

620
01:34:59,825 --> 01:35:04,496
No thought's forthcoming, no good,
No idea's born and no word.

621
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:09,084
A question that has no answer:
Whoever can come back.

622
01:35:09,585 --> 01:35:13,797
From the floor where no dancer
Was ever to leave track?

623
01:35:14,339 --> 01:35:18,760
I dream of another soul,
In quite a different garb:

624
01:35:19,136 --> 01:35:22,723
While shifting between dole
And hope, it burns up,

625
01:35:22,931 --> 01:35:27,019
Like alcohol, and goes
Away, casts no shadow.

626
01:35:27,478 --> 01:35:31,523
And just leaves as mementoes
The lilacs smelling of meadow.

627
01:35:31,732 --> 01:35:36,820
Run on, my child, do not lament
The fate of poor Eurydice,

628
01:35:37,196 --> 01:35:41,241
Just keep on driving to globe's end
Your copper hoop for all to see.

629
01:35:41,450 --> 01:35:45,662
As long as answering to your step,
However slight might be a tone,

630
01:35:46,246 --> 01:35:50,876
The earth sends signals gay and pep
To every energetic bone.

631
01:38:35,499 --> 01:38:39,378
Mom, the kerosene stove is smoking.

632
01:38:40,879 --> 01:38:42,005
What?

633
01:39:00,732 --> 01:39:02,776
Everything will depend on him.

634
01:39:02,985 --> 01:39:05,779
Do you think a sore throat could
have such an after-effect?

635
01:39:09,408 --> 01:39:11,451
A sore throat has nothing to do
with it.

636
01:39:15,747 --> 01:39:18,500
- This is a common case.
- Common?

637
01:39:25,632 --> 01:39:33,098
A mother dies suddenly,
then the man's wife and child...

638
01:39:34,850 --> 01:39:38,479
A few days and the man is no more,
though he was quite healthy.

639
01:39:38,687 --> 01:39:40,731
But no one died in his family.

640
01:39:42,608 --> 01:39:49,490
There're such things as conscience...
memories...

641
01:39:49,907 --> 01:39:51,658
What memories have to do it with it?

642
01:40:01,376 --> 01:40:06,256
- You think he's guilty of something?
- He thinks so.

643
01:40:06,507 --> 01:40:08,342
Leave me alone.

644
01:40:12,763 --> 01:40:18,018
- Did you say something?
- Leave me alone!

645
01:40:20,145 --> 01:40:24,191
I just wanted to be happy.

646
01:40:25,359 --> 01:40:29,029
And what's going to happen to your
mother if you don't get up?

647
01:40:34,743 --> 01:40:39,206
It's nothing, everything will be
all right...

648
01:40:41,250 --> 01:40:42,960
Everything will be...

649
01:41:59,119 --> 01:42:02,456
Would you rather have a boy
or a girl?

650
01:46:07,618 --> 01:46:11,914
The End
