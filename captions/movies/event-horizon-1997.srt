2
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,640
(Thunder rumbles)

3
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,040
(Liquid sloshes)

4
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,640
(Pages rustle)

5
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,640
(Screaming)

6
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,640
(Alarm beeping)

7
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,160
(Alarm stops)

8
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,480
Claire...

9
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,520
I miss you.

10
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,320
(Water dripping)

11
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,920
(Rinses razor)

12
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,120
(PA) Dr. Weir, report to
Lewis & Clark in Docking Bay four.

13
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,080
- Ion drive set.
- Thank you.

14
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,920
Heading: vector one-nine degrees.

15
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,440
We are prepped for lockdown.

16
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,480
(Beep)

17
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,720
I can't believe this.
It's ridiculous.

18
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,280
I haven't got more than my hand
in weeks, and now this shit.

19
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,880
Why can't we go to Mars, Captain?

20
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,720
I mean, Mars has...has got women.

21
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,040
Smith's right. Neptune...
there's nothing out there.

22
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,560
(Smith) Yeah, we'll be on our own.

23
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,640
That's the rules.
They drop the ball, we get the call.

24
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,800
Have you got our course plotted?

25
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,520
Locked and cocked.

26
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,480
Mr. Justin?

27
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,760
Everything's green
on my screen, Skipper.

28
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,000
- Start countdown.
- Ion drive in 10 minutes.

29
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,960
Thank you, Lieutenant. Let's go.

30
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,600
- Smith, follow me.
- Yes, ma'am.

31
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,360
(Captain) Justin, prep those tanks.

32
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,800
(Justin) Yes, sir.

33
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,440
Mr. Cooper. Ion drive in 10 minutes.

34
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,360
Ooh, time to play "spam-in-the-can".

35
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,920
- Skipper!
- Peters.

36
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,920
Captain Miller,
I just wanted to say that...

37
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,480
The clock is ticking, Doctor.

38
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,480
(Miller) Waiting for
a personal invitation, Mr. Smith?

39
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,920
- No, sir!
- Captain, I don't...

40
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,800
Follow the crew to the grav tanks.
We're almost under way.

41
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,800
Square away that bunk, Mr. Cooper,

42
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,600
or you're walking to Neptune.

43
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,360
What's the hold-up, Peters?

44
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,160
Loading the CO2 scrubbers, sir.

45
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,000
You stand right here.

46
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,400
(Smith) Thanks, DJ.

47
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,360
(Miller) Hats off.

48
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,440
- First time in a grav couch?
- Yeah.

49
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,840
Uh-huh.

50
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,400
I think your captain has a problem
with me.

51
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,640
Oh, well, don't worry about him.

52
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,080
He just loves having complete
strangers on his ship. DJ!

53
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,560
(DJ) Yeah!

54
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,880
Nah. Is this necessary?

55
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,680
When the ion drive fires
you'll be taking about 30 Gs.

56
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,880
Without a tank, the force
would liquefy your skeleton.

57
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,400
I've seen the effect on mice.

58
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,440
Claustrophobic?

59
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,080
Very.

60
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,360
Hmm.

61
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,480
(Woman whispers) Billy.

62
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,520
(Whoosh)

63
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,200
(Woman) I'm so alone.

64
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,600
Hello?

65
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,000
Is anyone there?

66
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,240
(Woman) Billy?

67
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,080
I'm so cold.

68
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,720
Claire.

69
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,840
I'm waiting.

70
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:33,120
Aah!

71
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,760
(Coughing)

72
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,600
You're all right. Breathe. DJ!

73
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,600
OK, Dr Weir.
Let's get you up. Come on.

74
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,040
I'm fine!

75
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,960
OK. There you go.

76
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,720
Move nice and slow. You've been
in stasis for 56 days.

77
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,560
You're a little disorientated.
Understand?

78
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,760
I'm all right. Thank you.

79
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,920
OK. Take that. Don't rush it.

80
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,080
All yours.

81
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,960
(Coughing)

82
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,840
You OK, Doc?

83
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,880
Want some coffee?

84
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,080
What?

85
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,480
(Slowly) Would you
like some coffee?

86
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,400
No. Thank you.

87
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,720
All right. Suit yourself.

88
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,920
What about you, Starck?
Want something hot and black?

89
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,560
- Is that an offer?
- No.

90
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,200
Then how about some coffee?

91
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,520
- Starck?
- Yes, sir.

92
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,240
Why aren't you on the bridge?

93
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,080
- Mind if I get dressed?
- Yes. Let's go, people!

94
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,320
(Peters) OK, Denny,
here we go. Happy birthday.

95
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,320
Play horsey, Mommy! Play horsey!

96
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,560
(Cooper) Oh! Oh!

97
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,440
Hey! No balls indoors.

98
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,560
(Cooper) Yo, apologise.
(Man) Sorry, Mama Bear.

99
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,400
- Uh, Peters?
- Yes, sir.

100
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,720
I did try to find
a replacement for you,

101
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,320
but it was impossible. I am sorry.

102
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,600
I talked to my ex. He's going
to take Denny for Christmas.

103
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,840
I'll get him for the summer,
so everything's all right.

104
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,760
(Cooper) Smitty!

105
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,640
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.

106
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,760
In approximately
2 hours and 23 minutes,

107
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,160
we'll be arriving at Neptune.

108
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,440
I thank you.

109
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,680
Ooh. Good.

110
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,560
Everything's five by five.

111
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,600
- USAC notified of our position?
- Yes, sir.

112
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,480
All right, people, listen up.

113
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:37,120
We have an addition to our crew.
Dr Weir, care to join us?

114
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,000
Introductions all around.

115
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,240
This is my XO... Lieutenant Starck.

116
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,520
Mr. Justin, Engineering.

117
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,520
The funky spaceman is Mr. Cooper.

118
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,640
What do you do here, Coop?

119
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,760
Doc. I'm your best friend.

120
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,840
Life-saver and heartbreaker.

121
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,040
(Miller) He's a rescue technician.

122
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,280
This is Peters, medical technician.

123
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,920
And my pilot...Mr. Smith.

124
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,280
The gloomy Gus in the corner
over there, that's, uh...

125
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,160
DJ Trauma.

126
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,040
(Laughter)

127
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,280
All right. All right.
Now, then, I got a question.

128
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,880
What the fuck are we doing here?

129
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,360
Perhaps the good doctor
will tell us.

130
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,400
Thank you. Uh, I want to say

131
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,920
how much I appreciate
this opportunity...

132
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,480
Yes. You appreciate
being here, Doctor,

133
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,600
but understand - we don't.

134
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,000
We were taken off leave
and sent into Neptune space.

135
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,440
We are three billion clicks
from the nearest outpost.

136
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,920
The last time USAC attempted
a rescue this far out...

137
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,960
we lost both ships.
So if you please...

138
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:42,040
Right. Well, everything
I'm about to tell you

139
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,920
is considered code black
by the NSA.

140
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,800
USAC intercepted
a radio transmission

141
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,680
from a decaying orbit
around Neptune.

142
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,600
The source of this transmission

143
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,800
has been identified
as the Event Horizon.

144
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,640
Yeah. Well, that's bullshit,
for starters.

145
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,440
I lost leave for this?
Thank you so much!

146
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,160
Smitty, sit down.

147
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,040
Cooper, as you were.

148
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,840
Just let the man speak.

149
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,080
(Weir) What was made public
about the Event Horizon...

150
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,280
that she was a research vessel,

151
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,920
that her reactor went critical,
and she blew up...

152
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,920
none of that is true.

153
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,200
The Event Horizon was
a secret government project

154
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,640
to create a spacecraft capable
of faster-than-light flight.

155
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,000
Uh, excuse me.
You can't actually do that.

156
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,360
(Starck) The law of relativity
prohibits it.

157
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,560
Relativity, yes. We can't break
the law of relativity,

158
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,920
but we can go around it.

159
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,000
The ship doesn't really
go faster than light.

160
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,080
It creates a gateway
to jump instantaneously

161
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,160
from one point to another
light years away.

162
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,440
How?

163
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,920
Well, that's difficult to...
it's all math.

164
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,400
Try us, Doctor.

165
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,320
Right. Well, uh,
using layman's terms...

166
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,920
we use a retaining magnetic field

167
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,480
to focus
a narrow beam of gravitons.

168
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,440
These, in turn, fold space-time

169
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,960
until the space-time curvature
becomes infinitely large

170
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,440
and you produce a singularity.
Now, the singularity...

171
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,360
Layman's terms.

172
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,120
Well, fuck layman's terms.
Do you speak English?

173
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,960
Uh...

174
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,640
Imagine for a minute
that this piece of paper...

175
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,320
Uh, excuse me.
That's Vanessa, and that's mine.

176
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,960
This piece of paper
represents space-time,

177
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,320
and you want to get from "A"...

178
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,000
- Ooh.
- to "B" there.

179
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,320
Now, what's the shortest
distance between two points?

180
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,160
- A straight line.
- (Laughter)

181
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,520
Wrong. The shortest distance
between two points is zero,

182
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,400
and that's what the gateway does...

183
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,120
it folds...space

184
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,920
so that point "A" and point "B"

185
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,840
coexist in the same
space and time.

186
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,640
When the spacecraft
passes through the gateway,

187
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,920
space returns to normal.

188
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,240
It's called a gravity drive.

189
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,760
(Justin) How do you know all this?

190
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,680
I built it.

191
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,200
Well, I see why they sent you.

192
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,920
So if the ship didn't blow up,
then what happened?

193
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,840
Well...
the mission was going perfectly,

194
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,440
they reached safe distance
using conventional thrusters,

195
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,240
they had the go-ahead
to use the gravity drive

196
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,880
to open the gateway
to Proxima Centauri,

197
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,040
and then, they just disappeared,

198
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,240
vanished without a trace. Until now.

199
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,360
Where has she been, Doctor?

200
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,760
That's what we're here to find out.

201
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,360
(Weir) We've been unable
to verify life contact.

202
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,960
The TDRS did receive
this single transmission.

203
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,480
(High-pitched squealing)

204
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,160
(Deep howling noise)

205
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,880
(Transmission ends)

206
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,360
- What the fucking hell is that?
- Listen to this.

207
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,480
Houston passed the recording
through several filters

208
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,600
and managed to isolate what
appears to be a human voice.

209
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,920
(Indistinct voices and squealing)

210
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,440
(Transmission ends)

211
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,120
- I'm not sure it is language.
- Latin.

212
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,480
- What?
- I mean, I think...

213
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,880
Well, it sounds like Latin.

214
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,320
- Can you translate it?
- Play it again.

215
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,880
(High-pitched squealing)

216
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,160
(Indistinct voice)

217
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,320
Right there. You hear that?

218
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,440
(Replays recording)

219
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,160
Sounds like "liberate me"
something or other.

220
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,400
I can't make out the rest.

221
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,520
"Liberate me"?

222
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,400
"Save me."

223
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,400
(Alarm sounding)

224
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,200
(Miller) All right. Stations, people.

225
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,120
Crossing the horizon. Optimum
approach angle is 14 degrees.

226
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,640
(Miller) Come around to 3-3-4.

227
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,040
3-3-4.

228
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,760
Make your approach
vector negative 14 degrees.

229
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,880
1-4 degrees.

230
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,000
Locked on Event Horizon's
navigation beacon.

231
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,960
She's in the upper ionosphere,

232
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,560
and it looks like
we're in for some heavy chop!

233
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,400
- Bring us in tight.
- Yes, sir.

234
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,160
- Mr. Justin, how's my ship?
- Smooth sailing, sir.

235
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,200
Matching speed on my mark.

236
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,240
Three, two, one, mark!

237
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,560
- Range?
- 10,000 metres, sir.

238
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,520
- Starck!
- Yes, sir!

239
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,800
Check radio.
See if anybody's listening.

240
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,520
This is the USAC Lewis & Clark
hailing Event Horizon.

241
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,040
Event Horizon, do you read?

242
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,840
(Miller) Dr Weir!
I think you'll want to see this.

243
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,960
- Where is she?
- Dead ahead, 5,000 metres!

244
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,080
- Starck?
- Event Horizon, do you read?

245
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,640
3,000 metres and closing!

246
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,120
- Can't see anything!
- 1,500 metres, sir. Too close.

247
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,960
- Where is it?
- Right in front!

248
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,920
- 1,000 metres.
- Proximity warning!

249
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,080
900! 800!

250
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,520
700!

251
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,840
- We're gonna hit!
- Starck!

252
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,160
God!

253
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,560
Reverse thrusters! Full!

254
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,480
There she is.

255
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,840
(Justin) Jesus.

256
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,800
Very impressive ship, Doctor.

257
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,600
Thank you.

258
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,240
Mr. Smith, are you up for a flyby?

259
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,920
Y-yes, sir. Yes, sir. I'd love to.

260
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,760
(Thunder rolls)

261
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,760
That's the main airlock,
we can dock in there.

262
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,120
All right. Smith, use the arm

263
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,640
and lock us onto
that antenna cluster.

264
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,440
Go carefully here. That's not
a load-bearing structure.

265
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,000
It is now, Doctor.

266
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,160
Everything five by five?

267
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,080
Locked into the Event Horizon.

268
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,200
Light 'em if you got 'em.

269
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,640
Thank you very much, sir.

270
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,640
Starck, give me a read.

271
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,640
The reactor's still hot.

272
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,880
We've got several
small radiation sources,

273
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,760
but they're leaks, nothing serious.

274
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,280
(Miller) Pressure?

275
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,840
The hull's intact,
but there's no gravity,

276
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,240
and thermal units are off-line.

277
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,840
The crew couldn't survive
unless they were in stasis.

278
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,120
- Find them, Starck.
- Already on it, Captain.

279
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,920
Bio-scan on-line.

280
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,920
(Starck) There's something
wrong with the scan.

281
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,600
- Radiation interference?
- Not enough.

282
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,840
I'm picking up life forms
but I can't get a lock.

283
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,760
These readings don't make sense.

284
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,400
OK. We do it the hard way...
room by room.

285
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,720
Starck, deploy the umbilicus.

286
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,080
- Smitty, fire up the War Room.
- Sir.

287
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,720
Mr. Justin, you're up for a walk?

288
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,920
Yes, sir.

289
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,960
Doctor, I'll need you here.

290
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,440
Captain... I need to be on that ship.

291
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,280
Once it's secured,
we'll bring you on board...

292
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,440
That's unacceptable. I need to be...

293
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,200
Once we've secured the ship.

294
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,480
I need you to guide us.
Help us do our job.

295
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,400
Oh, oh, honey, honey, honey.

296
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,360
You forgot your briefcase.

297
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,280
(Cooper) Stand clear!

298
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,520
(Miller) Anything
gets funky, Cooper...

299
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,480
I'll be on it!

300
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,920
Yo, Baby Bear...

301
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,320
keep your nose clean.

302
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,000
DJ, showtime.

303
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,280
Video feed is clear.

304
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,160
Are you with us, Dr Weir?

305
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,360
Yes, I'm with you.

306
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,280
We are crossing the umbilicus,

307
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,080
making our approach
to the Event Horizon.

308
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,720
You're at the outer airlock door.

309
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,320
(Click)

310
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,800
(Miller) Magnetic boots on.

311
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,840
(Click)

312
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,040
(Starck) We've got pressure.

313
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,400
(Miller) Place is a deep-freeze.

314
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,600
We got ice crystals everywhere.

315
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,640
That's the central corridor
that you're in.

316
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,760
It connects the front of the
ship to Engineering at the rear.

317
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,760
(Miller) Mr. Justin, take Engineering.

318
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,120
(Justin) Yes, sir.

319
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,080
Peters and I
will take the forward decks.

320
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,640
(Beeping)

321
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,920
(Miller) Doctor, what are these?

322
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,360
(Peters) Yeah. I've got
another one over here.

323
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,800
In an emergency, they destroy
the central corridor

324
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,960
and split the ship in half,

325
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,880
and then the crew can use
the foredecks as a lifeboat.

326
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,360
(Miller) I'm in Medical.

327
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,920
No casualties.

328
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,320
Place looks like
it's never been used.

329
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,480
(Weir) You haven't seen any crew?

330
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,800
If we saw any crew,
Doctor, you'd know it.

331
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,000
Scanning for life readings.

332
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,360
This place is a tomb.

333
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,640
Oh, fuck me!

334
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,560
(Starck) Miller. Miller, are you OK?

335
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,640
(Cooper) Skipper's
got a case of the willies.

336
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,840
(Starck) Cooper, back to your post.

337
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,080
Miller, your heart rate
just rocketed.

338
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,480
I'm fine.

339
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,600
(Justin) I think
I've reached the door

340
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,000
to the first
containment, Dr Weir.

341
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,800
(Weir) The engineering decks
are on the other side.

342
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,760
OK. Let's take a look.

343
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,480
What the hell is this place, Dr Weir?

344
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,560
It's to enter the second containment

345
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,440
Without compromising
the magnetic fields.

346
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,400
Looks like a meat grinder to me.

347
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,280
(Peters) I'm on the bridge.

348
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,920
Got some blood here.

349
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,120
(Justin) There must have been
a coolant leak.

350
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,320
Man, this shit is everywhere.

351
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,760
Coolant levels on reserve

352
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,880
but well within the safety line.

353
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,280
Ms Peters, could you
turn back and left?

354
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,320
- What is it?
- "Ship's log."

355
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,560
(Straining)

356
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,040
It's stuck.

357
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,640
It's pretty jammed in there.

358
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,680
Oh!

359
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,000
What the hell happened to his eyes?

360
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,480
Explosive decompression.

361
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,760
Decompression doesn't do that.

362
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,920
(Smith) Looks like
it was caused by...

363
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,960
I don't know, an animal.

364
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,200
Look at the soft tissue,
the massive abrasions.

365
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,320
Corpse-cicle.

366
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,200
(Justin) I'm scanning
for life forms.

367
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,760
Man, I'm getting some really
strange readings in here.

368
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,600
Let me see
if I can get some power up.

369
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,160
That's the core, the gravity drive...

370
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,040
The heart of the ship.

371
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,080
(Beeping)

372
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,040
Justin? Justin, you're breaking up!

373
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,960
Aah!

374
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,600
Justin, come in!

375
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,560
Ahh...

376
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,400
- What's up?
- The life scan lit up.

377
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,200
(Beeping)

378
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,160
Something's wrong. Pull him out.

379
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,040
Oh, shit!

380
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,840
Aah!

381
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,560
He's in trouble!

382
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,920
- Go, Coop!
- I'm gone!

383
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,760
Aah!

384
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,680
Uh!

385
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,720
(Miller) Boarding party, sound off.

386
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,360
This is Miller. Can anybody hear me?

387
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,960
What the fuck was that?

388
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,040
Pressure emergency!
We've lost the starboard baffle!

389
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,520
The hull's been breached!

390
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,200
I'll contain it
as long as I can! Get out!

391
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,040
We're losing atmosphere!

392
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,200
There are pressure suits
in the airlock. Go!

393
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,800
Here I come!
Here I come!

394
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,240
Hold on, Baby Bear!

395
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,200
I'm almost there, almost there!

396
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,160
I got you! I got you! Uh!

397
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,560
Oh! Watch out! Watch!

398
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,880
I got you. What the fuck is this?

399
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,440
Hold on! Uh!

400
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,480
(Smith) Captain Miller!
Do you copy? Over!

401
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,600
Smitty, where you been?

402
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,640
We have a situation, sir!
We've lost the starboard baffle,

403
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,640
and the hull's been breached!

404
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,640
The safety circuits have failed!

405
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,440
Time for a weld?

406
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,240
No, sir! We've got 218 litres of gas,

407
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,000
and then we've got nothing!

408
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,400
The oxygen tanks failed.
Sir, we are fucking dead!

409
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,120
What about the Event Horizon?

410
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,320
What?

411
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,080
She's got air and power!

412
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,840
It's our only chance!

413
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,160
There's no way
I'm getting on that bastard!

414
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,240
It beats dying, Mr. Smith.

415
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,120
I want all personnel on board
the Event Horizon pronto.

416
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,440
- Meet at the air tanks.
- I'm ahead of you, sir.

417
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,240
Bringing thermal units on-line.

418
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,960
Hold tight. Prep for Gs.

419
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,680
Gravity in five seconds.

420
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,560
(Cooper shouting)

421
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,920
Wake up!

422
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,200
Open your eyes, all right?

423
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,560
(Thunder rumbling)

424
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,960
Dr Weir.

425
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:00,080
Well, I brought
most primary systems on-line...

426
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,240
for now.

427
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,600
Thank you. Starck, what's our status?

428
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,000
The antenna array is completely
fried.

429
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,120
We've got no radio,
no laser, no high gain.

430
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,960
No one's coming to help.

431
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,520
- This air tastes bad.
- Yeah. Carbon dioxide.

432
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,480
And the CO2 filters here are shot.

433
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,080
Take the Clark's.
That gives us...what?

434
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,480
Enough breathable air for 20 hours,

435
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,920
but after that, we'd better be going.

436
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,040
(Thunder rumbling)

437
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,440
(Smith) I'm on the port side,

438
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,800
approaching the dorsal heat sink.

439
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,120
Holy shit.

440
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,000
Captain Miller.

441
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,960
Captain Miller, do you copy?

442
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,480
Smith. How's my ship?

443
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,040
Sir, we've got
a seven-metre fracture.

444
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:06,480
We can repair her,
but it'll take a long time.

445
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,360
Negative. 20 hours, we suffocate.

446
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,840
Understood, sir.

447
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,480
(Miller) What happened here, Doctor?

448
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,560
OK. How is he?

449
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,640
His vital signs seem stable,

450
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,760
but he's unresponsive to stimuli.

451
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,200
I don't know.

452
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,080
He might wake up in 15 minutes.

453
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,280
He might not wake up ever.

454
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,760
(Cooper) Skipper, this sounds weird,

455
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,280
but, I mean,
there was, like, nothing,

456
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,640
and then Justin appeared,

457
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,000
and, um, there was liquid,

458
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,240
and the whole core just turned solid.

459
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,480
It's just not physically possible.

460
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,160
Doctor, please, don't start
in with that physics shit.

461
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,400
I'm telling you, I saw it.

462
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,400
It would mean the gateway was open.

463
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,440
Then the gateway was open.

464
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,840
It couldn't be because the
gravity drive wasn't activated.

465
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,880
I'm telling you what I saw...

466
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,960
It can't start by itself!

467
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,840
Mr. Cooper, you are out of line!

468
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,840
Doctor, Mr. Justin may die.

469
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:23,040
Now, whatever happened to him
could happen to all of us.

470
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,960
Mr. Cooper says he saw something.

471
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,920
I believe he saw something.

472
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,120
I need an explanation.

473
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:39,120
Well, in my view, Mr. Cooper's
delusional...

474
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,720
but maybe he saw an optical effect

475
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,320
caused by gravitational distortion.

476
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,720
An optical effect!
That's fucking poetic.

477
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,160
Cooper!

478
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,960
I'm sorry. I'm all right. OK.

479
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,720
Gravitational distortion...

480
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,240
what could create that, Doctor?

481
00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:00,600
If, somehow, a burst of gravity
waves escaped from the core,

482
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,480
it could distort space-time.

483
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,240
It could make Justin
seem to disappear.

484
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,200
It could also have damaged
the Lewis & Clark.

485
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,160
However, I think this
is entirely unlikely.

486
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,320
What's in the core, Doctor?

487
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,640
It's complicated.

488
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,360
Well, how much time do you need?
We have...

489
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,960
17 hours and 48 minutes.

490
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,320
What's in the core?

491
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,440
(Weir) This is the gateway.

492
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,760
Now, these three magnetic rings,
when they align,

493
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,240
it creates an artificial black hole,

494
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,640
which allows the ship
to travel to any point in space.

495
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,160
(Starck) A black hole,

496
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,920
the most destructive force
in the universe...

497
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,640
and you've created one?

498
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,240
Absolutely. Yes.

499
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,040
Because we can use that immense
power to bend space-time.

500
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,480
Look, it would take the Lewis & Clark

501
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,120
a thousand years
to reach our nearest star,

502
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:55,280
but the Event Horizon
could be there in a day.

503
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,480
- If it worked.
- Come down. It's quite safe.

504
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,440
(Miller) So if Justin
was sucked through,

505
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,280
he's been wherever
the Event Horizon's been.

506
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,160
(Weir) Theoretically, yes,
but I told you,

507
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,400
the gateway can't just open.

508
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,640
I see. I want this room sealed off.

509
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,880
Second containment is off limits.

510
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,200
(Starck) Yes, sir.

511
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,080
Captain, there's no danger.

512
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,920
The gateway's contained.
It's perfectly safe.

513
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,920
Safe?!

514
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,960
Doctor, my ship is in pieces,

515
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,560
and one of my crewmen almost died.

516
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,760
No one else goes near this.

517
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,120
(Peters) Come on.

518
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,720
(Sighs)

519
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,880
There's got to be something
on this log.

520
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,760
You can do this.

521
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,960
(Scraping)

522
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,240
DJ?!

523
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,280
(Scraping)

524
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,360
DJ, where are you?

525
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,640
(DJ) I'm up on Deck 4.

526
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,200
(Scraping)

527
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,600
Mommy.

528
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,480
- Peters!
- Aah!

529
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,600
What is it? You all right?

530
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,960
Phew!

531
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,120
What's up? You was out there so long.

532
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,880
I'd rather spend 12 hours outside

533
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,600
than another five seconds in here.

534
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,760
It's the final entry
in the ship's log.

535
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,280
I'm very proud of my crew.

536
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,920
I'd like to name my station heads:

537
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,560
Chris Chambers, Janice Reuben,

538
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,680
Ben Fender, Dick Smith.

539
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,200
We've reached safe distance...

540
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,640
(Weir) That's John Kilpack,
ship's captain.

541
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,240
We're preparing
to engage the gravity drive

542
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,840
and open the gateway
to Proxima Centauri.

543
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,400
"Ave atque vale."

544
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,960
"Hail and farewell."

545
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,800
(Static and high-pitched howling)

546
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,720
What is that?

547
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,080
I'll see if I can clean it up.

548
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,440
It's a power drain.

549
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,360
It's the core.

550
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:01,160
Stay here. I don't want
anybody else near that thing.

551
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,720
Wait for me, Doctor!

552
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,600
(Miller) What's causing the drain?

553
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,320
(Weir) Magnetic fields are holding.

554
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:11,200
There may be a short
in the fail-safe circuit.

555
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,400
Can you give us a hand?

556
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,440
(Choking)

557
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,920
Justin! Justin, can you hear me?

558
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,840
- He's coming!
- Who's coming?

559
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,760
The dark.

560
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,520
Aah!

561
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,360
Ah, yeah. That's the one.

562
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,440
(Claire) Billy.

563
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,960
Billy.

564
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:41,320
(Weir breathing heavily)

565
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,280
(Claire) Billy.

566
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,280
(Weir gasping)

567
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,680
Miller!

568
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,880
Captain Miller,
I've got some problems here!

569
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,600
Be with me...

570
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,320
forever.

571
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,840
Dr Weir!

572
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,360
(Splash)

573
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,120
(DJ) Carbon dioxide
can produce hallucinations,

574
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,320
impair judgement.

575
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,960
Goddamit, it was not a hallucination.

576
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,160
Doctor, you were in the duct.

577
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,360
You must have heard something.

578
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,480
You must have seen something.

579
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,880
(Peters) I did.

580
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:03,080
About an hour ago, I saw my son
lying on the examination table.

581
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,280
and...

582
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,400
in his legs were crawling...

583
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:11,720
Ms Peters, it sounds a little like
shock.

584
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,440
You're traumatised...

585
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,160
No. No. Excuse me! No!

586
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,360
I've seen bodies before.
This was different.

587
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,160
(Miller) She's right.

588
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,080
This...this was real.

589
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,000
I felt... I felt heat.

590
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,600
This is not something
that's in our heads.

591
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,320
Smitty, have you seen

592
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,160
anything unusual at all?

593
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,000
No, I haven't seen anything,

594
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,360
and I don't need to see
anything, sir,

595
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,280
but this ship is fucked.

596
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,040
Well, thank you, Mr. Smith.

597
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,760
(Smith) Yeah, you don't...

598
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,200
(Miller) OK, OK! All right, Doc.

599
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,680
Breaking the laws of physics costs!

600
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,200
You killed the last crew, now us!

601
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,200
- DJ!
- It's just a fucking ship.

602
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,160
It's just a ship, a hunk of metal.

603
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,040
There's nothing odd going on.

604
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,440
DJ...

605
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,360
(Smith) Fine.

606
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,760
Oh, DJ...

607
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,680
(Peters) OK. Let's see this.

608
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,000
You all right?

609
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,920
Yeah. I'm just... I'm sorry.

610
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,840
(Peters) Whoa! Goddamit!

611
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,400
(Miller) Hey. Smitty. Smitty!

612
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,760
(Smith) There's no fucking chance...

613
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,080
That's enough! I want you cool! Now!

614
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:22,440
All right.

615
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,600
You're going outside
on the Clark with Cooper

616
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,760
and you're going to repair
the ship. No mistakes.

617
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,560
Mistakes, nobody goes home.
Understood?

618
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,520
(Smith) Yes, sir. All right.

619
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,080
Get moving.

620
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,520
(Starck) Miller.

621
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,880
What, Starck?

622
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,800
I ran the bio-scan.

623
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,520
The results were bioreadings...

624
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,240
Of an indeterminate origin. Yes.

625
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,040
Tell me something useful, Lieutenant.

626
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,840
- I've got a theory.
- Let's hear it.

627
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,440
There's a connection

628
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,640
between the readings
and the hallucinations,

629
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,920
Iike part of a defensive
reaction, an immune system.

630
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,640
I don't have time...

631
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,080
- Listen.
- To what?

632
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,520
This ship is reacting,

633
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,600
and the reactions
are getting stronger.

634
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,720
As if the ship brought back
something with it.

635
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,880
What are you telling me?
That this ship is alive?

636
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,280
You wanted an answer.

637
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:21,320
I want to survive the next 10 hours.

638
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,600
(Thunder rumbling)

639
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,400
(Peters) Justin?

640
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,480
Justin!

641
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,360
Justin!

642
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,080
(Bang on door)

643
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,760
(Bang on door)

644
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,040
(Banging)

645
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,520
(Banging stops)

646
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,120
Did you hear that?!
Did you hear that?!

647
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:07,040
You heard it. What is it?

648
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,160
Listen to me.

649
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,720
It's DJ, all right?

650
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,520
Neither of us heard anything.

651
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,080
Just calm down. Get your breath back.

652
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,080
OK.

653
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,520
- Now, tell me.
- I was...

654
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,320
(Banging continues
and Peters screams)

655
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,960
(Peters) Make it stop!

656
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,400
Make it stop!

657
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,000
(Weir) Open the door.

658
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,640
(Peters) No!

659
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,880
(DJ) Weir, stop!

660
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,400
Stop him!

661
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,760
(Starck) What are you doing?!

662
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,800
Aah!

663
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:43,400
In our current environment,
self-control is an asset.

664
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,600
(Alarm buzzing)

665
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,120
(Starck) What is it?

666
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:54,000
Um...the forward airlock.

667
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,640
Miller, Smith, Cooper,
anyone in the airlock?

668
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,800
(Miller) That's a negative, Starck.

669
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,160
Justin.

670
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,560
(Peters) Justin!
(DJ) No!

671
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,880
(Peters) Justin, no!

672
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,480
Justin, no! Justin, open the door!

673
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:11,960
Miller, come in.

674
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,760
Miller, come in.
We have an emergency.

675
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,480
What's going on, Starck?

676
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,160
Justin's in the airlock.

677
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,440
Say again.

678
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,000
(Starck) Justin's
in the airlock without a suit.

679
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,360
- I'm on it.
- No, sailor.

680
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,000
- Skipper, you need me.
- Stay there.

681
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,880
- He's engaged the override.
- Shut it down.

682
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,560
- I'll try.
- Coming to him, Starck.

683
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,440
Justin! Open this door now!

684
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,480
(Miller) Starck, give me status.

685
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,800
He's engaged the override.
We can't open the door.

686
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,760
- I'll get the kit.
- Justin, open the door!

687
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,200
Justin, open the door.

688
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,720
Did you hear it?

689
00:49:55,720 --> 00:50:00,360
- Keep him talking.
- Yes, I heard it. What is it?

690
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:03,680
It shows you things...
horrible things.

691
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,280
What does?

692
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,800
The dark inside me...
from the other place.

693
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,280
- I won't go back there.
- Baby Bear, open the door!

694
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,640
- What's happening?
- He won't listen.

695
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:18,880
If he opens the airlock
he'll turn inside out.

696
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,120
(Peters) Stay with me!
(Starck) Almost got it...

697
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,880
Stay with me, Justin! Open that door!

698
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,400
If you could see what I've seen,
you wouldn't stop me.

699
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,920
That's not you talking!

700
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,400
That's not you talking.

701
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:35,120
That's it, there. Open the door.
Go for that button.

702
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,640
OK.

703
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,480
OK, OK...

704
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,280
No! No!

705
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,120
(Screaming)

706
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:45,440
He's activated the door.
It's on a 30-second delay.

707
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,000
(Miller) Justin!

708
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,480
Aah!

709
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:55,480
(Computer voice) Stand by
for decompression in 25 seconds.

710
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,600
(Justin) Where am I? Hey...

711
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,680
- Open it!
- Open the door...

712
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,040
I can't.

713
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,000
It won't open when
the outside door's triggered.

714
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,600
- Oh, God.
- Mama Bear...open the door.

715
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,840
Come on. Please...

716
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,320
- Captain!
- Patch me through.

717
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:16,240
- Tell them to open it.
- I can't, Justin.

718
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,120
- I don't want to die.
- You're not gonna die.

719
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,400
Listen, I'll get you out.

720
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,240
Oh, my God.

721
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,680
It's starting. My eyes!

722
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:34,040
Don't think about them.
Shut them as tight as you can.

723
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,400
Five seconds.

724
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,680
Tuck yourself into a ball.

725
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,960
(Justin) I can't breathe!

726
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,280
Oh! Oh, God!

727
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,920
Oh, God, it hurts!

728
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,160
I want you to huff and puff
and empty your lungs.

729
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,040
Do you hear me, Justin?!

730
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,640
(Screaming)

731
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,560
(Miller) Do it! Now!

732
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,520
(Justin screaming)

733
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,440
OK, Baby Bear.

734
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,040
(Miller) Got him. I got him.

735
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,200
Stand by, people.

736
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,640
Stand by!

737
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,520
We've got pressure.

738
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,280
(Peters) We're coming, Justin!

739
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,600
We're coming!

740
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,440
(DJ) We're going to
need five units here.

741
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,040
(DJ) Hold his head still.

742
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,360
(Peters) OK!

743
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,280
(Justin coughing)

744
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,720
Give me some more glycerine now!

745
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:34,600
- One thing at a time.
- Christ, he's bleeding!

746
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:47,440
I stopped the bleeding.
Stabilised him best I can.

747
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,000
(Sighs)

748
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,200
He won't be pretty, but he
should live...if we get back.

749
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,680
We'll make it.

750
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,600
Starck, what's our time like?

751
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,800
CO2 levels will become
toxic in four hours.

752
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,960
All right. Peters,
we've got to find out

753
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:08,240
what happened to the other crew
before it happens to us.

754
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:12,480
I can work on the bridge,
but I won't go back to Medical.

755
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,240
- Fine.
- Yes, sir.

756
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:20,640
(Starck) Justin said
something about...

757
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,840
"the dark inside me."

758
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:25,040
What's that mean?

759
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,920
Doctor?

760
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,800
I-I don't think it means anything.

761
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,560
(Miller) Don't you
walk away from me, mister.

762
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,720
I'd like some answers, Doctor.

763
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:45,080
Why did one of my
men try to commit suicide?

764
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:48,440
I'd like to know
what caused that noise.

765
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,360
Look, thermal changes in the hull

766
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,640
could have caused it
to expand and contract,

767
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,160
causing reverberations.
It's possible.

768
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,920
Bullshit! You built this ship.

769
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:59,000
You've given me nothing
but bullshit.

770
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,280
What do you to hear?

771
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,200
You said the ship's drive
creates a gateway.

772
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,600
Yeah.

773
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,040
To what?

774
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,600
I don't know.

775
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,920
Where did you send it?

776
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,440
I don't know.

777
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,840
Where has it been for seven years?

778
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:18,200
- I don't know.
- That's not good enough.

779
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:22,400
You're the expert.
I need answers. That's your job.

780
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,920
Now, the other place, where is that?

781
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,840
I don't know! I don't know!

782
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:30,760
Look, there's a lot of things
happening around here

783
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,600
that I don't fully understand.

784
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,000
I need time.

785
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,880
I see.

786
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,920
Well, that's exactly
what we don't have, Doctor.

787
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,360
(Man) Captain!

788
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,960
Don't leave me!

789
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,400
Don't leave me!

790
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,400
Please!

791
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:15,160
For God's sakes, help me!

792
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,720
It's in your head.

793
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,600
It's just in your head.

794
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,040
(Screams)

795
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,240
God help us.

796
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,480
(Thunder rumbling)

797
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:59,280
(Miller) I'm telling you,
it was his voice I heard.

798
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,240
He was calling to me...a young
bosun named Eddie Corrick.

799
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,440
We served on the Goliath together.

800
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,840
When the O2 tanks ruptured,

801
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:12,720
four of us made it to the lifeboat,

802
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,400
but Corrick was still on board
when the fire broke out.

803
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,600
You ever seen fire in zero gravity?

804
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,840
It's beautiful.

805
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,080
It's like liquid.

806
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:30,520
It slides all over everything.

807
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:33,800
Comes up in waves.

808
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,680
And they just kept hitting him,

809
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:39,880
wave after wave.

810
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,880
He was screaming for me to save him.

811
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,480
What did you do?

812
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:48,160
I did the only thing I could.

813
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:53,880
I closed the lifeboat hatch,
and I left him behind.

814
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:00,840
I swore I'd never lose another man.

815
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,200
I've known you a long time.

816
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,520
You never told me that.

817
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,880
That's just it, DJ.
I never told anybody.

818
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,400
But this ship knew about it.

819
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:15,560
It knows my fears.
It knows my secrets.

820
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:19,720
Gets inside your head,
and it shows you.

821
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:22,080
I wasn't going to tell you this.

822
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:27,520
I've been listening
to the distress signal,

823
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,400
and I, um...

824
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:34,200
think I made a mistake
in the translation.

825
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,760
(Turns on tape player)

826
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,600
(Voice) "Liberate tutemet..."

827
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,400
(Turns off tape player)

828
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,840
Go on.

829
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:48,240
I thought it said "liberate me"...

830
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,120
"Save me."

831
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:53,120
But it's not "me."

832
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:56,000
It's "liberate tutemet"...

833
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,240
"Save yourself."

834
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,440
And it gets worse.

835
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,960
(Voice) "Liberate tutemet
ex inferis."

836
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,520
There.

837
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,720
I think...

838
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,000
That says "ex inferis."

839
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,440
"Save yourself...

840
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,400
"from hell."

841
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:23,680
Look, if what Dr Weir
tells us is true,

842
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,640
this ship has been beyond

843
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,280
the boundaries of our universe,

844
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,960
of known scientific reality.

845
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,680
Who knows where it's been,

846
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,040
what it's seen...

847
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:40,520
and what it's brought back with it?

848
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,640
From hell.

849
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,640
You don't believe
in that stuff, do you?

850
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:56,680
Whoever sent that message,
he sure believes in hell.

851
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:58,640
(Cooper on intercom)
"Captain Miller!"

852
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,800
It better be good, Coop.

853
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:07,840
(Cooper) Ready to repressurise
the Clark and get out of here.

854
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:09,320
On my way.

855
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,880
(Miller) Come on, baby.
Don't let me down.

856
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,440
(Miller) Hello, baby.

857
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:26,680
Papa's home.

858
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:29,200
(Smith) She's holding.

859
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,560
Oh, shit.

860
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:33,160
(Cooper) Skipper, we're
still venting trace gasses.

861
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:35,440
Give me 20 minutes to plug it.

862
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,200
(Miller) Cooper,
you are the life-saver.

863
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,400
20 minutes and we're under way.

864
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,640
Shit.

865
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,560
(Thunder rumbling)

866
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,480
Got any coffee?

867
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,400
Yeah, but it's cold.

868
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,920
Great.

869
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,480
(Screeching and screaming)

870
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,840
Starck!

871
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,720
(Screeching and screaming continues)

872
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,960
Oh!

873
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,240
Miller!

874
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,120
(Screaming and yelling)

875
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:23,880
(Voice) "Liberate tutemet
ex inferis."

876
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:27,320
(Screaming and yelling)

877
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,240
We're leaving.

878
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,160
(Thunder rumbling)

879
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,040
No, we can't leave.

880
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,720
Our orders are specific.

881
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:42,160
Rescue the crew, salvage the ship.

882
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:45,040
They're dead, Doctor.
Your ship killed them.

883
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,880
- We came to do a job.
- We're aborting!

884
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,400
Starck, download the files

885
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,240
from the Event Horizon's computers.

886
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:55,440
DJ, get Justin prepped
and ready to move to the Clark.

887
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,360
There's stuff I want from Medical.

888
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:01,000
- Move him to the tank.
- No problem. Do it.

889
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,840
- Peters.
- Yes, sir.

890
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,960
(Miller) Get the CO2 scrubbers.
Take Smitty with you.

891
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,560
(Weir) Captain...

892
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,000
Captain...

893
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,640
Don't do this.

894
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,360
It's done.

895
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:19,600
You can't leave my ship!

896
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:22,040
I have no intention of leaving her.

897
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:24,600
I will take the Lewis & Clark

898
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:28,280
and launch TAC missiles
at the Event Horizon.

899
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:29,800
No.

900
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,880
(Alarm beeping)

901
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,960
Captain, bio-scans
just went off the scale.

902
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:43,600
The core's draining power
from the rest of the ship.

903
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:47,080
Get the files.
Vacate. I want off this ship.

904
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:50,720
You can't leave. She won't let you.

905
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,920
Just get your gear
or you're walking home.

906
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,120
I am home.

907
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:58,920
(Peters) Let's go!

908
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,840
Ready?

909
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:02,360
(Smith) Shot.

910
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,640
Come on. Come on.

911
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,120
Ready?

912
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,560
Shot.

913
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:13,960
Shot. OK.

914
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:16,800
Can we go? This place freaks me out.

915
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:20,120
- You wanna breathe going home?
- No! Let's go!

916
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,200
Shit! 25! Come on!

917
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,400
We need 25! Peters!

918
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,560
Come out! Got it!

919
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,040
(Breathing heavily)

920
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,280
(Peters gasps)

921
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,240
Aah!

922
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,320
Oh, no, Peters.

923
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,240
Oh.

924
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,720
Oh, God.

925
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,160
(Claire) Billy.

926
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,400
Claire?

927
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,920
Claire.

928
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:23,840
It's me. I'm home.

929
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,640
I'm home.

930
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:35,120
I know I wasn't there
when you needed me, and...

931
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:37,600
I'm sorry I...

932
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:41,120
I let my work come between us.

933
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:46,840
God, Claire, no.

934
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:48,760
I'm begging you.

935
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:50,840
Please, please don't.

936
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:52,920
Not again, please.

937
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,440
I've been so...

938
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,240
(Groaning)

939
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,520
I've been so...

940
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:06,120
(Claire) Billy.

941
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:08,160
It's all right.

942
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,680
I've been so alone.

943
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:16,000
You'll never be alone again.

944
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,200
You're with me now.

945
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:20,400
You're with me,

946
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:25,200
and I have such wonderful,
wonderful things...

947
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,600
to show you.

948
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:30,360
(Squish)

949
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:31,880
(Screaming)

950
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:46,320
Damn, I'm good!

951
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,520
Coop...

952
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:53,400
Coop, how long are you going to take?

953
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:56,280
You can kiss my ass, Smith. I'm done.

954
01:06:56,280 --> 01:07:00,080
Just let me collect my tools,
and we can go.

955
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:02,640
- Two minutes, tops.
- Roger that.

956
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,200
(Clank)

957
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:12,000
Weir! Dr Weir!

958
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,880
Weir!

959
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,000
Weir!

960
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:23,560
Dr Weir, get your ass
back on board now! Weir!

961
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:25,400
Shit.

962
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,880
Captain Miller, do you copy? Over.

963
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:30,360
Captain Miller, do you copy? Over.

964
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:31,520
Go ahead, Smitty.

965
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:35,440
I've just seen Weir messing
around on the Clark, sir.

966
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:39,440
Stand by, Smitty.
I wanna check something out.

967
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,760
- Smith, get out.
- Come again, sir?

968
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:50,160
Explosives are missing.
Weir's put it on Clark.

969
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:53,600
No, sir. No way.
I've just put it back together.

970
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,080
Get off there, Smith!

971
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,640
Where the fuck are you?

972
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,440
(Thunder rumbling)

973
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,000
Got you.

974
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,560
Hang on, Smitty! I'm coming!

975
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,840
No!

976
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,080
Shit!

977
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:35,920
(Cooper) Shit!

978
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,800
Where the fuck am I going?

979
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:40,760
Why does this shit
happen to me? Fuck.

980
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:44,920
All right, think, Coop. Think. Think!

981
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:48,560
Get back to the ship.
Get back to the ship.

982
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:52,200
Blow my air tank.
I'll blow my air tank.

983
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:55,240
All right. Fuck.

984
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:56,920
Oh, this better work.

985
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:58,600
This shit better work.

986
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:01,240
Here I go. One, two, three.

987
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:02,680
Come on. Come on!

988
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:04,840
Come on! Yes!

989
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:07,000
Yes! Yes!

990
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,360
Here I come, motherfuckers!

991
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:16,800
DJ.

992
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:19,320
What was that?

993
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:22,920
Clark's gone.
Smitty and Cooper are dead.

994
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:24,280
What the...?

995
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:26,480
You spot Weir, take him out.

996
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,360
Understood.

997
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:30,400
Be careful, DJ.

998
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,240
Don't worry about Weir.

999
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:34,120
I'll take care of him.

1000
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:44,000
(DJ choking)

1001
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,320
DJ?

1002
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,880
Aah!

1003
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:00,640
(Miller) "DJ! DJ, answer me!"

1004
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,360
(Slice)

1005
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:14,560
(Gurgles)

1006
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,160
(Miller) OK, Dr Weir.

1007
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,360
You don't wanna leave your ship?

1008
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:57,640
(Cocks gun) You never will.

1009
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,880
(Thunder rumbling)

1010
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:28,480
(Clank)

1011
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,640
(Thunder rumbling)

1012
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:55,600
Starck.

1013
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:18,400
It's OK.

1014
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:20,320
It's OK.

1015
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:24,360
I'll get you out of here.

1016
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:29,160
OK, OK...

1017
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,560
Easy.

1018
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:48,560
(Thunder rumbling)

1019
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:50,840
(Miller) Oh, my God.

1020
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:54,160
What happened to your eyes?

1021
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:58,040
Where we're going,
we won't need eyes to see.

1022
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:00,040
What are you talking about?

1023
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:04,160
I created the Event Horizon
to reach the stars,

1024
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:08,280
but she's gone much,
much further than that.

1025
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:11,440
She tore a hole in our universe...

1026
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:14,600
a gateway to another dimension...

1027
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:18,280
a dimension of pure chaos...

1028
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:20,680
pure evil.

1029
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:24,640
When she crossed over,
she was just a ship,

1030
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:27,880
but when she came back...

1031
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,760
she was alive.

1032
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:33,920
Look at her, Miller.

1033
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:37,040
Isn't she beautiful?

1034
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:41,160
Your beautiful ship
killed its crew, Doctor.

1035
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:45,120
Well...

1036
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,320
now she has another crew.

1037
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,360
Now she has us.

1038
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:59,880
What do you think
you're doing, Doctor?

1039
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:04,320
You wanted to know
where the ship has been...

1040
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,600
so now you'll find out.

1041
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,640
(Starck grunting)

1042
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,400
If you miss me,
you blow out the hull.

1043
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:24,520
What makes you think I'll miss?

1044
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,880
(Cooper) That's right! I'm back!

1045
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:29,920
I'm...oh, shit! I can't stop! Hey!

1046
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,560
Hey! Fuck.

1047
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,200
(Groans)

1048
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,880
What?! Who the fuck?!

1049
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,600
Who the...? Oh, shit!

1050
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,280
(Screams)

1051
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:43,280
(Miller) No!

1052
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:46,040
(Groans)

1053
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:35,640
(Screaming)

1054
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:09,520
Miller!

1055
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:11,960
Miller!

1056
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:16,280
(Alarm beeping)

1057
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:25,880
- Give me your hand!
- (Grunting)

1058
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:31,480
Ow!

1059
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:35,560
- Come on!
- I can't!

1060
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,080
I'm not leaving you!

1061
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,040
(Metal screeches)

1062
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,960
(Alarm buzzing)

1063
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,920
Forward airlock.

1064
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:07,520
It can't be Weir.

1065
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:09,440
I'm not taking any chances.

1066
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,320
You watch your back.

1067
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:23,840
Yo! Don't hit me!

1068
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,480
Cooper!

1069
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:27,680
Take it off! Take it off!

1070
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:29,880
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

1071
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:32,080
You're OK. You're OK. It's over.

1072
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:33,760
No, it's not.

1073
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:36,920
Weir's activated the gravity
drive. We got to shut it down.

1074
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:40,720
- How? The bridge is gone.
- What about Engineering?

1075
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:42,640
Dr Weir was the expert.

1076
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:46,120
I don't want to go
where the other crew went.

1077
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:47,560
We'll blow it.

1078
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:49,920
- Blow it?
- Like Weir said.

1079
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:51,360
Blow the corridor,

1080
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:55,240
separate us from the ship,
use the foredecks as a lifeboat.

1081
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:58,960
TDRS should pick up
our emergency beacon.

1082
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:02,600
We put ourselves in stasis,
and stand by for rescue.

1083
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:04,600
I'll manually arm these explosives.

1084
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:06,080
Skipper, will this work?

1085
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:09,600
Go activate the emergency beacon
and you get back here.

1086
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,000
- Yes, sir.
- I'm coming.

1087
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,360
- You stay here.
- Miller.

1088
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,240
Close this door
behind me, Lieutenant.

1089
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:20,360
(Thunder rumbling)

1090
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:32,000
(Computer) "Gateway opening

1092
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,720
Yes.

1093
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:45,320
Blood?

1094
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,800
Oh, fuck me.

1095
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,640
Fuck me.

1096
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,440
Starck!

1097
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:09,480
Aah!

1098
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:13,120
Aah!

1099
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:22,520
Starck!

1100
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:27,560
Run!

1101
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:34,280
(Computer) "Gateway opening
in T-minus three minutes."

1102

is authorised."

(Computer) "The main
corridor is now armed."

1104
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,120
We're armed. She's ready to blow.

1105
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,960
I repeat. She's ready to blow.

1106
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:52,880
Miller. Miller, can you hear me?

1107
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:55,800
We have to get out of here now.

1108
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:57,240
(Fire roars)

1109
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:58,720
You let me burn!

(Computer) "Gateway opening
in T-minus two minutes."

01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:27,600
(Fire roars)

1112
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:37,560
Miller!

1113
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:40,560
Aah!

1114
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:55,520
(Miller coughing)

1115
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,320
(Corrick) You left me behind.

1116
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:02,560
No, you're not Edward Corrick.
I watched him die.

1117
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:08,200
Weir?

1118
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:10,160
(Laughs)

1119
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:12,120
The ship brought me back.

1120
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:15,120
I told you she won't let me leave.

1121
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:17,000
She won't let anyone leave.

1122
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,200
Did you really think
you could destroy this ship?

1123
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:23,240
She's defied space and time.

1124
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:26,680
She's been to a place
you couldn't possibly imagine.

1125
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:28,440
And now...

1126
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:30,960
it is time to go back.

1127
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:33,240
I know. To hell.

1128
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:37,040
You know nothing.
Hell is only a word.

1129
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:41,120
The reality is much, much worse.

1130
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:46,200
Now let me show you.

1131
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:47,680
(Screaming)

1132
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,560
Help me!

1133
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:51,440
(Screaming)

1134
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:54,000
No!

1135
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,240
No. No. No.

1136
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:59,080
(Weir) You see?

1137
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:02,440
No, they're not dead.
They're not dead.

1138
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:04,480
Not yet.

1139
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,520
(Yells)

1140
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,680
(Miller) You - won't -

1141
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:11,200
take - my - crew!

1142
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,560
(Yells)

1143
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:29,440
(Moaning)

1144
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,720
They're not your crew any more.

1145
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:33,640
They belong to the ship.

1146
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:36,080
(Computer) "Gateway opening."

1147
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:49,240
(Yells)

1148
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:50,760
Take me.

1149
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:53,600
You take me! You leave them alone!

1150
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,320
No.

1151
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:57,040
There is no escape.

1152
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:01,560
(Weir) The gateway is open,

1153
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:03,960
and you are all coming with me.

1154
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:06,320
Aah!

1155
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,640
Do you see?

1156
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:12,960
(Moaning)

1157
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:15,840
(Weir) Do you see?

1158
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,600
Aah!

1159
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,040
Do you see?!

1160
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:22,440
Yes...

1161
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,400
I see.

1162
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:29,200
(Beeping)

1163
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:34,040
No!

1164
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:36,040
(Thunder rumbling)

1165
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:49,680
Miller.

1166
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:59,840
(Man) This is Rescue One.
We have contact.

1167
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:03,520
Approaching the wreckage
of the Event Horizon.

1168
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,320
Prepare to board.

1169
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:17,280
(Man) I'm entering
the grav couch bay.

1170
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:21,120
It doesn't appear to have been
damaged in the explosion.

1171
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:25,920
There appear to be
three survivors:

1172
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:29,160
Cooper, Justin,
Lieutenant Starck.

1173
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:32,640
Justin seems to have suffered
massive injuries,

1174
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:34,440
but he's still alive.

1175
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:38,080
The grav couches still have power.

1176
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:43,120
I'm opening the first tank now.

1177
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:47,360
(Starck gasping)

1178
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:54,680
(Man) It's all right. It's OK.

1179
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:56,120
You're safe now.

1180
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:57,560
Justin. Cooper.

1181
01:26:57,560 --> 01:26:59,880
They're fine. They're fine.
They're with us.

1182
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:01,480
You're with us.

1183
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:04,360
(Screams)

1184
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:05,640
(Cooper) Starck.

1185
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:07,160
Stay calm. It's all right.

1186
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:09,080
(Cooper) Starck, calm down. It's me.

1187
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:10,720
Breathe deeply. Breathe deeply.

1188
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:12,480
I need a sedative here now!

1189
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:14,240
(Cooper) I got you, Starck..

1190
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:15,560
It's OK.

1191
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:17,200
Sedative now!

1192
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:19,120
(Cooper) Starck, we're safe.

1193
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:21,000
(Man) OK, OK! I need it now!

1194
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,200
(Cooper) We're safe.
