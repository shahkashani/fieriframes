3
00:01:00,401 --> 00:01:04,501
Axxon N., the longest running radio play in history

4
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:08,835
tonight, continuing in the Baltic region.

5
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:12,800
A gray winter day in an old hotel.

6
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,990
The stairway is dark

7
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,100
I don't recognize this hallway.
Where are we?

8
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,220
At our room now

9
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,450
I don't have the key

10
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,150
No, you gave it to me. I have it

11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What's wrong with me?

12
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,750
This is the room? I don't recognize it

13
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,960
- Take off your clothes.
- Sure.

14
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,180
You know what whores do?

15
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,420
Yes

16
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,620
They fuck

17
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,550
- Do you want to fuck me?
- Take off your clothes

18
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,620
I'll tell you what I want

19
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,020
Fine

20
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,520
I'm afraid

21
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,120
I'm afraid

22
00:04:31,676 --> 00:04:35,575
I am going to find out one day.

23
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,175
When will you tell him?

24
00:04:46,674 --> 00:04:50,174
Who could have known?

25
00:04:55,073 --> 00:04:57,573
What time is it?

26
00:05:11,871 --> 00:05:14,871
I have a secret.

27
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,969
There have been no calls today.

28
00:05:41,668 --> 00:05:45,167
I hear someone.

29
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:58,565
I do not think it will be much longer now.

30
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,000
You are looking for something?

31
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,100
Yes

32
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,940
- Are you looking to go in?
- Yes

33
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,600
An opening?

34
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,100
- Look for an opening. Do you understand?
- Yes, I understand

35
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,200
- Do you understand I look for an opening?
- Yes. I understand completely.

36
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,800
Good. Good that you understand.

37
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That's good!

38
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You understand!

39
00:09:26,741 --> 00:09:27,776
May I help you?

40
00:09:27,876 --> 00:09:30,240
I am a new neighbor.

41
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,840
I live just down the street.

42
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,340
Ma'm?

43
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:44,639
Hello!

44
00:09:46,838 --> 00:09:48,838
I don't mean to intrude

45
00:09:50,838 --> 00:09:52,838
I am your new neighbor.

46
00:09:53,238 --> 00:09:58,237
I hope that it is not being incovenient for you?

47
00:09:58,437 --> 00:10:00,437
No, no.

48
00:10:00,937 --> 00:10:03,036
Please, sit down.

49
00:10:06,836 --> 00:10:09,836
Such a lovely home!

50
00:10:11,135 --> 00:10:12,235
Thank you.

51
00:10:12,335 --> 00:10:14,335
We enjoy it very much.

52
00:10:14,335 --> 00:10:16,335
Please.

53
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:22,934
Uh, would you like uh, coffee?

54
00:10:23,434 --> 00:10:26,334
That would be lovely.
Thank you.

55
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:27,833
And for you, ma'm?

56
00:10:27,933 --> 00:10:30,833
The same, Henry, thank you.

57
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:39,632
I've, I've been going around
meeting new neighbors.

58
00:10:39,832 --> 00:10:42,767
I think that it is important
know one's neighbors.

59
00:10:42,867 --> 00:10:46,731
To say 'hello' to them.

60
00:10:50,831 --> 00:10:54,830
Yes, it's very rare these days
but that's very nice.

61
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,730
Which house are you living in?

62
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,829
Just down the way.

63
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,830
Tucked back in the small woods.

64
00:11:07,229 --> 00:11:10,528
The brick house.

65
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:14,428
I think I know the one.

66
00:11:15,828 --> 00:11:19,727
It is difficult to see it from the road.

67
00:11:36,225 --> 00:11:38,225
Thank you.

68
00:11:58,523 --> 00:12:01,222
Milk and sugar?

69
00:12:07,722 --> 00:12:09,821
Oh, yes, very good.

70
00:12:10,421 --> 00:12:11,756
Will that be all ma'm?

71
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,856
Yes. Yes, thank you.

72
00:12:15,021 --> 00:12:18,020
I'll be just close by if you need me.

73
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
Thank you, Henry.

74
00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:31,619
So...

75
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:35,018
You have a new role to play, I hear.

76
00:12:37,018 --> 00:12:38,718
Up for a role

77
00:12:38,818 --> 00:12:42,817
But, I'm afraid,
far from getting it.

78
00:12:42,852 --> 00:12:46,717
No, no, I definitively heard that you have it.

79
00:12:49,817 --> 00:12:51,817
Oh?

80
00:12:52,216 --> 00:12:54,216
It is an...

81
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,815
Is it an interesting role?

82
00:12:59,315 --> 00:13:02,215
Oh yes, very

83
00:13:04,315 --> 00:13:07,914
Is it about marriage?

84
00:13:10,814 --> 00:13:13,814
Um... perhaps, in some ways...
but... um...

85
00:13:13,849 --> 00:13:17,713
Your husband, he's involved?

86
00:13:19,313 --> 00:13:21,313
No.

87
00:13:36,211 --> 00:13:40,810
A little boy went out to play.

88
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:43,810
When he opened his door...

89
00:13:43,811 --> 00:13:47,011
...he saw...
the world.

90
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:51,209
As he passed through the doorway...

91
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:56,109
...he caused, a reflection.

92
00:13:56,509 --> 00:13:59,708
Evil was born

93
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:06,807
Evil was born,
and followed the boy.

94
00:14:12,707 --> 00:14:15,506
I'm sorry...
what is that?

95
00:14:18,306 --> 00:14:21,406
An old tale.

96
00:14:21,806 --> 00:14:24,805
And a variation:

97
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,706
A little girl...

98
00:14:26,806 --> 00:14:30,206
...went out to play.

99
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:35,804
...lost in the marketplace...

100
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,203
...as if half born.

101
00:14:44,603 --> 00:14:49,802
Then, not through the marketplace,
you see that, don't you?

102
00:14:49,902 --> 00:14:54,202
But through the alley behind the marketplace.

103
00:14:54,302 --> 00:14:59,501
This is the way to the Palace.

104
00:15:03,001 --> 00:15:07,400
But it isn't something you remember.

105
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,799
Forgetfulness, it happens to us all.

106
00:15:14,099 --> 00:15:19,199
And me?... why, I'm the worst one!

107
00:15:20,099 --> 00:15:23,498
Oh, where was I?

108
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:33,297
Yeah.. Is there is a murder in your film?

109
00:15:37,297 --> 00:15:41,496
Ah, no, it's not part of the story...

110
00:15:42,796 --> 00:15:43,896
No!

111
00:15:43,996 --> 00:15:46,795
I think you are wrong about that!

112
00:15:47,795 --> 00:15:49,795
No.

113
00:15:49,795 --> 00:15:52,295
Brutal fuckin' murder!

114
00:15:53,895 --> 00:15:56,794
Ah... I don't like this kind of talk

115
00:15:57,294 --> 00:16:00,934
The things you've been saying,
I think should go now.

116
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,193
Yes...

117
00:16:04,293 --> 00:16:13,092
Me... I.. I can't seem to remember if it's
today, two days from now, or yesterday!

118
00:16:13,692 --> 00:16:18,792
I suppose that if it was 9:45...

119
00:16:18,827 --> 00:16:22,191
I'd think it was after midnight!

120
00:16:26,691 --> 00:16:28,790
For instance...

121
00:16:28,825 --> 00:16:30,825
If today...

122
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,790
...was tomorrow...

123
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:41,390
...you would'nt even remember
that you owed on an unpaid bill.

124
00:16:44,789 --> 00:16:45,788
Actions...

125
00:16:45,888 --> 00:16:49,488
...do have consequences.

126
00:16:53,487 --> 00:16:55,687
And yet

127
00:16:56,087 --> 00:16:58,787
...there is the magic.

128
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,986
If it was tomorrow...

129
00:17:04,686 --> 00:17:10,685
...you would be sitting over there.

130
00:17:24,784 --> 00:17:28,083
You see?

131
00:17:37,082 --> 00:17:39,182
Excuse me, ma'm?

132
00:17:40,682 --> 00:17:44,681
Excuse me, ma'm,
telephone.

133
00:17:46,481 --> 00:17:48,481
It's for you.

134
00:17:49,681 --> 00:17:51,781
It's your agent.

135
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,680
Greg!

136
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:03,279
Greg!

137
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:06,279
Oh my god! Oh my god!

138
00:18:18,277 --> 00:18:20,277
My God

139
00:18:34,975 --> 00:18:38,710
Nikki, it's we who are happy
and fortunate to have you on board

140
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:41,775
...on this film,
in this role.

141
00:18:42,774 --> 00:18:45,854
I meant everything I said in praising Devon.

142
00:18:46,674 --> 00:18:49,674
And forgive me, I do love making speeches.

143
00:18:50,574 --> 00:18:51,973
I mean this too...

144
00:18:52,073 --> 00:18:55,373
You have everything you need to soar
back to the top...

145
00:18:55,473 --> 00:18:57,773
...and to stay perched there.

146
00:18:57,808 --> 00:19:02,672
This film, you and Devon,
a great director.

147
00:19:03,572 --> 00:19:06,472
Yes, do I hear?

148
00:19:07,572 --> 00:19:09,671
The script is well, we're going to plunge into.

149
00:19:09,771 --> 00:19:13,471
If all play our role,
do our best...

150
00:19:13,571 --> 00:19:15,771
...if we work hard together

151
00:19:15,971 --> 00:19:18,570
... well, this could be the one...

152
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:22,200
This is a starmaker, if ever I saw
one, you'll see

153
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:26,669
I think we have a chance to pull it off...

154
00:19:27,569 --> 00:19:28,969
what do you say?

155
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:31,869
Let's do it!

156
00:19:32,369 --> 00:19:35,968
If you don't fuck it up Kingsley,
I'm sure we can!

157
00:19:37,168 --> 00:19:40,168
I never felt better in my life.

158
00:19:40,568 --> 00:19:43,018
Champaign and caviar is on its way.

159
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:50,566
Tonight, Nikki Grace and Devon Berk.

160
00:19:50,766 --> 00:19:53,466
Marsha, honey I know where you live,
do not pull my hair.

161
00:19:53,566 --> 00:19:54,701
We're back in:

162
00:19:54,801 --> 00:19:58,765
5,4,3,2,1.

163
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:02,665
Mamas, lock up you daughter's doors!

164
00:20:02,765 --> 00:20:08,764
Nikki, really, this news, this
shocking revelation by Devon...

165
00:20:08,864 --> 00:20:12,464
...must send a shiver down your spine!

166
00:20:12,864 --> 00:20:14,164
Are you going to be able to be true
to hubby with a wolf in the den?

167
00:20:14,264 --> 00:20:18,463
do with a bad wolf round you

168
00:20:19,363 --> 00:20:20,698
Now, Marilyn...

169
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:25,562
I'm sure we'll get on famously,
in a professional way

170
00:20:25,662 --> 00:20:28,762
and that's how it will stay,
professional.

171
00:20:34,261 --> 00:20:38,961
And, Devon, your naughty boy,
are you hiding a smile?

172
00:20:39,861 --> 00:20:42,760
Is your devilish mind scheming?

173
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,360
If you're looking for shock value Marilyn,
I suggest that you look in the mirror.

174
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:54,359
What a bitting wit!

175
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:59,693
But I tell you this:
Marilyn Levins is going to be watching,

176
00:20:59,793 --> 00:21:03,958
and she will be reporting to you
everything she finds out!

177
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:11,157
There, and there, and there and beyond
around the world!

178
00:21:11,257 --> 00:21:15,156
The Marilyn Levins Starlight Celebrity
show will be back next week

179
00:21:15,256 --> 00:21:16,691
...from Hollywood, California.

180
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,256
Where stars make dreams...

181
00:21:19,356 --> 00:21:23,255
...and dreams make stars.

182
00:21:24,855 --> 00:21:28,455
How were you assholes thinking? That
was the biggest crock of shit I ever saw!

183
00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:29,655
Show's popular!

184
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:31,755
Bullshit!

185
00:21:32,254 --> 00:21:34,655
Oh, you guys, how did it go?
Honey, you were great!

186
00:21:34,755 --> 00:21:37,690
- You were amazing, how do you feel?
You were incredible. - Good...

187
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:41,153
You absolutely nailed it. Did you hear her?
Did you hear what Marilyn said?

188
00:21:41,253 --> 00:21:43,453
She said you blowed! You were perfect!

189
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:46,353
So Devon, this one's off limits, right?

190
00:21:46,853 --> 00:21:48,052
Don't even think about it...

191
00:21:48,152 --> 00:21:51,452
...If I don't kill you, her husband will,
and he is THE most powerful guy around.

192
00:21:51,552 --> 00:21:54,652
He knows everything. There is not a
thing he does'nt know.

193
00:21:54,752 --> 00:21:57,651
I can tell you stories that
would color your hair.

194
00:21:57,751 --> 00:21:59,651
So listen to me when I tell you.

195
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:03,251
Around Nikki, keep it in your pants.

196
00:22:04,051 --> 00:22:06,250
What the fuck are you guys talking about?

197
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:10,050
She's a nice girl, she's so far
from my style, it's not even funny.

198
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:14,149
Beautiful, Devon. Great.
We'll be able to sleep tonight

199
00:22:16,249 --> 00:22:19,849
You gotta admit though...
She's got a nice ass.

200
00:22:25,648 --> 00:22:27,348
- It's good.
- Goodnight guys!

201
00:22:27,448 --> 00:22:30,528
- Goodnight, I'll talk to you tomorrow.
- OK.

202
00:22:30,547 --> 00:22:32,747
- Bye!
- Let's go!

203
00:23:08,043 --> 00:23:10,043
Good morning Mrs. Grace.

204
00:23:23,741 --> 00:23:26,441
Fantastic.

205
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:28,640
It all in the beans!

206
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,140
And I'm just full of beans!

207
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,640
Is that our set?

208
00:23:37,939 --> 00:23:40,539
Yeah It's not finished yet

209
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:43,939
There's Smithie's House.

210
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:46,039
Smithie's House.

211
00:24:01,836 --> 00:24:06,436
I should have guessed you two professionals
would be here early and beavering away...

212
00:24:06,536 --> 00:24:09,546
We're just laying about drinking capuccino.

213
00:24:09,636 --> 00:24:12,035
Devon makes a great capuccino.

214
00:24:12,135 --> 00:24:13,335
Care for one?

215
00:24:13,435 --> 00:24:17,735
Thanks, but Prey and I just had a cup of tea.

216
00:24:17,736 --> 00:24:21,835
Actually, it was a terrible cup of tea
at the commissary.

217
00:24:23,934 --> 00:24:28,033
'Terrible' is an adequate description of it.

218
00:24:45,831 --> 00:24:48,831
Well, I thought since we're here
and Smithie site's been started...

219
00:24:48,931 --> 00:24:51,531
We might go over some of the scenes
that take place there.

220
00:24:51,631 --> 00:24:55,030
Not the love scene, of course, but some of
the earlier scenes

221
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:58,210
that indicate so beautifully your character.

222
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:04,429
Lets take, for instance,
scene 35...

223
00:25:04,829 --> 00:25:10,628
...the scene where Devon...
you arrive,

224
00:25:10,663 --> 00:25:17,727
...Billy, at Smithie's house to find Sue,
- Nikki- looking out the window.

225
00:25:17,762 --> 00:25:19,627
I remember the scene

226
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,527
Well...

227
00:25:21,627 --> 00:25:23,727
...we'll go through it...

228
00:25:24,727 --> 00:25:27,326
...and then we'll maybe take it on
the set and plug it out as possible

229
00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:29,326
I guess we should just jump right in?

230
00:25:29,426 --> 00:25:30,526
- That would be jolly good.
- Ok

231
00:25:30,626 --> 00:25:32,326
And, I'll start it off...

232
00:25:32,426 --> 00:25:36,525
...on page 57.

233
00:25:36,825 --> 00:25:41,225
Nikki, this is just a rough run-through
So don't be hard on yourself...

234
00:25:41,325 --> 00:25:44,424
I am expecting from you, an Academy Award
performance, right out of the gate, so...

235
00:25:44,524 --> 00:25:46,724
Thanks, Devon.
Get going, please

236
00:25:54,023 --> 00:25:56,193
I didn't think you'd be here...

237
00:25:59,023 --> 00:26:01,322
No, of course you wouldn't

238
00:26:01,922 --> 00:26:04,422
...that's because you...

239
00:26:05,422 --> 00:26:07,422
what

240
00:26:07,422 --> 00:26:09,621
what do you want?

241
00:26:11,221 --> 00:26:14,621
I said some things last night as you know.

242
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:16,721
Yeah.

243
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,420
And I want to apologize

244
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:25,119
- Apologize?
- Yeah.

245
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:31,819
The things you said weren't the truth?

246
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:34,518
I didn't say that

247
00:26:36,018 --> 00:26:38,518
Were they the truth?

248
00:26:48,117 --> 00:26:50,117
Are you crying?

249
00:26:51,516 --> 00:26:53,516
Uh huh...

250
00:26:54,216 --> 00:26:56,216
Yeah.

251
00:26:59,415 --> 00:27:02,215
Are you sorry about last night?

252
00:27:03,215 --> 00:27:05,615
Are you?

253
00:27:07,914 --> 00:27:10,214
Why are you crying?

254
00:27:12,014 --> 00:27:13,814
I'm sorry, Billy.

255
00:27:13,914 --> 00:27:16,313
I'm so sorry

256
00:27:17,413 --> 00:27:19,413
what?

257
00:27:22,713 --> 00:27:25,612
Oh, shit.

258
00:27:29,012 --> 00:27:32,111
Look in the other room.

259
00:27:32,811 --> 00:27:34,611
What is that?

260
00:27:34,711 --> 00:27:36,346
Freddy!

261
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,611
No, someone's there.

262
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:46,910
This stage is ours and ours alone.

263
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:53,309
Well, let's have a look.

264
00:29:01,801 --> 00:29:03,801
Who was it?

265
00:29:03,801 --> 00:29:07,021
Disappeared where it's real hard to disappear.

266
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:16,599
Maybe we should talk,
maybe this is the time.

267
00:29:16,699 --> 00:29:20,199
Let's be serious for a moment
about something other than this scene.

268
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:21,698
- Why?
- what is it?

269
00:29:21,798 --> 00:29:23,798
Sit down, I'll tell you.

270
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:30,197
It was Freddy who first heard about it

271
00:29:32,097 --> 00:29:35,697
If you have an assistant who can hold his
liquor, then...

272
00:29:35,797 --> 00:29:38,096
...Freddy can do that with the best of them.

273
00:29:38,196 --> 00:29:41,196
Somebody's got to do it,
Gable's dead.

274
00:29:42,896 --> 00:29:46,695
Now, Freddy is purposefully out and about
gathering what in this business...

275
00:29:46,795 --> 00:29:48,795
...is the most valuable commodity...

276
00:29:48,895 --> 00:29:50,695
...information.

277
00:29:50,795 --> 00:29:55,629
Information is indispensable.
You probably know this from your own lives..

278
00:29:55,729 --> 00:30:00,094
...we all have people who gather...
agents, friends, producers...

279
00:30:00,194 --> 00:30:02,694
And sometimes they share,

280
00:30:04,193 --> 00:30:06,693
...sometimes not.

281
00:30:07,093 --> 00:30:10,893
Politics, ego,

282
00:30:11,792 --> 00:30:13,592
...fear...

283
00:30:13,692 --> 00:30:14,992
Kingsley?

284
00:30:15,092 --> 00:30:18,172
sometimes I just isn't told the whole story.

285
00:30:20,191 --> 00:30:22,891
Kingsley, get to the point.

286
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:34,490
'On High In Blue Tomorrows'
it is, in fact, a remake.

287
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:37,190
It's a remake?

288
00:30:38,589 --> 00:30:40,189
I wouldn't do a remake.

289
00:30:40,289 --> 00:30:42,989
No, no no, I know, of course,
But you didn't know

290
00:30:43,089 --> 00:30:47,588
The original was a differrent name.
Started, but never finished.

291
00:30:49,188 --> 00:30:52,988
Now, Freddy has found out that our producers
know the history of this film...

292
00:30:53,088 --> 00:30:57,887
... and have taken it upon themselves not to pass on that information to us.

293
00:30:57,987 --> 00:30:59,587
Purposefully.

294
00:30:59,687 --> 00:31:01,886
Not on me, and I assume not the two of you...

295
00:31:01,986 --> 00:31:03,286
True?

296
00:31:03,386 --> 00:31:05,686
No, absolutely.

297
00:31:05,786 --> 00:31:07,786
Nobody told me anything.

298
00:31:07,786 --> 00:31:10,185
No. Me neither.

299
00:31:10,585 --> 00:31:13,485
I thought this was an original script.

300
00:31:14,285 --> 00:31:16,285
Yeah, well...

301
00:31:19,284 --> 00:31:21,684
Anyway, the film it was never finished...

302
00:31:21,784 --> 00:31:25,184
Something happened before
the film was finished.

303
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:29,483
I don'tot understand.
why wasn't it finished?

304
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:35,782
Well, after the characters
had been filming for some time,

305
00:31:35,882 --> 00:31:44,081
...they discovered something... something...
inside the history.

306
00:31:44,681 --> 00:31:47,281
Please, Kingsley.

307
00:31:47,681 --> 00:31:51,581
The two leads,
were murdered.

308
00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:04,579
It was based on a Polish-gypsy folk tale.

309
00:32:05,179 --> 00:32:07,679
The title in German was 'Vier Sieben'.

310
00:32:07,779 --> 00:32:09,779
'Four Seven'.

311
00:32:10,378 --> 00:32:12,578
And it was said to be cursed.

312
00:32:18,777 --> 00:32:21,377
...so it turned out to be.

313
00:32:28,476 --> 00:32:30,476
What?

314
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,900
Did you understand what I said?

315
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:36,875
I don't understand.

316
00:32:36,975 --> 00:32:38,975
Hmm, you don't speak Polish.

317
00:32:39,175 --> 00:32:40,900
No.

318
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Half of it...

319
00:32:45,174 --> 00:32:48,474
I think she understands more
than she lets on...

320
00:32:49,274 --> 00:32:51,274
But I don't speak it.

321
00:33:01,472 --> 00:33:03,472
Take a seat.

322
00:33:12,071 --> 00:33:14,271
What's this all about?

323
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:24,869
I've been hypnotized,
or something

324
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:27,669
Hypnotized?

325
00:33:30,669 --> 00:33:32,868
And I'm...

326
00:33:36,568 --> 00:33:38,568
I'm...

327
00:33:41,467 --> 00:33:43,467
I'm going to kill someone.

328
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:47,667
Oh, yeah?
Who you going to kill?

329
00:33:50,266 --> 00:33:52,366
I don't know.

330
00:33:57,166 --> 00:33:59,965
Who hypnotized you?

331
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:06,764
The saw him looking at me once when I...

332
00:34:06,864 --> 00:34:11,164
...when I looked around the bar, and...

333
00:34:11,864 --> 00:34:15,163
He done moved his hands...

334
00:34:17,163 --> 00:34:19,563
...and he said that I...

335
00:34:19,963 --> 00:34:22,663
...which I would'nt know who I was.

336
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,722
How are you going to kill this person?

337
00:34:27,462 --> 00:34:30,262
With a screwdriver

338
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:03,458
Your wife...

339
00:35:07,057 --> 00:35:10,137
I've been with her since I was a little boy.

340
00:35:10,657 --> 00:35:12,657
A little boy?

341
00:35:15,756 --> 00:35:18,356
Nothin' little about you now...

342
00:35:19,356 --> 00:35:23,055
As far as I heard, that is.

343
00:35:27,955 --> 00:35:29,955
why are you doin this?

344
00:35:30,155 --> 00:35:32,454
Doin what?

345
00:35:35,454 --> 00:35:37,654
Don't play dumb with me, Billy.

346
00:35:38,653 --> 00:35:40,653
I got husband.

347
00:35:40,753 --> 00:35:43,253
You got a wife and two kids.

348
00:35:46,153 --> 00:35:49,052
why are you doin this?

349
00:35:49,952 --> 00:35:52,552
'cause I never met you before.

350
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:55,452
what?

351
00:35:55,851 --> 00:35:58,851
I didn't know you before

352
00:36:01,251 --> 00:36:04,650
I never had this feeling.

353
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,150
You have it too...

354
00:36:12,549 --> 00:36:14,549
Don't you?

355
00:36:18,549 --> 00:36:21,348
I can't afford to, Billy.

356
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:27,948
All I see from this is blue tomorrows.

357
00:36:33,447 --> 00:36:35,447
OK, cuts.

358
00:36:39,146 --> 00:36:41,146
That was brilliant We're moving on...

359
00:36:41,246 --> 00:36:43,766
Check the gate please.
Camera reload.

360
00:36:44,046 --> 00:36:46,545
- Good, good.
- 27 for lunch.

361
00:36:47,945 --> 00:36:49,945
- Did you feel good about
it? - Yeah, I felt great. - Ok

362
00:36:50,045 --> 00:36:53,845
So we're going to leave this lovely weather?

363
00:36:55,344 --> 00:36:58,844
- Freddy, did you have an ashtray..
- I had one...

364
00:37:14,842 --> 00:37:16,242
Going well?

365
00:37:16,342 --> 00:37:18,642
Very well, thank you, Freddy.

366
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:21,541
Very enjoyable

367
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:25,441
Enjoyable, yes,
thats is the word.

368
00:37:26,541 --> 00:37:31,040
Are you enjoying yourself Freddy?

369
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:36,839
Well, there is a vast network, right?

370
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:40,339
An ocean of possibilities

371
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:44,339
I like dogs.

372
00:37:44,439 --> 00:37:48,038
It used to raise rabbits
I've always loved animals.

373
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:50,838
Their nature...

374
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:52,838
...how they think...

375
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:56,937
I saw dogs reason their way out of problems.

376
00:37:57,037 --> 00:38:01,836
watched them think through the
trickiest situation.

377
00:38:02,836 --> 00:38:05,636
Do you have a couple of bucks I can borrow?

378
00:38:05,736 --> 00:38:09,336
I've got this terrible landlord.

379
00:38:22,534 --> 00:38:24,534
Thanks.

380
00:38:25,434 --> 00:38:27,464
I got a lot of nerve, I know.

381
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:33,333
It seems like only yesterday
I was carrying my own weight.

382
00:39:12,028 --> 00:39:14,728
is the 19 year old neice...

383
00:39:14,928 --> 00:39:18,162
Ever since we went into pre-production,
she's been

384
00:39:18,262 --> 00:39:19,827
...fascinated by Smithie.

385
00:39:19,927 --> 00:39:22,587
Keeps going on and on about Smithie...

386
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:27,226
...asking in that ancient foreign voice of hers

387
00:39:28,526 --> 00:39:31,126
Who is playing Smithie?

388
00:39:55,523 --> 00:39:57,523
Where did everyone go?

389
00:39:58,023 --> 00:40:02,922
Sorry she taken Mr. Berg upstairs

390
00:40:09,921 --> 00:40:11,921
Alright.

391
00:40:33,518 --> 00:40:35,218
I listen to you, but...

392
00:40:35,318 --> 00:40:38,218
...I don't hear him.

393
00:40:39,318 --> 00:40:41,698
Excatly sure what your getting in?

394
00:40:42,417 --> 00:40:44,867
I am going to put my arm around you

395
00:40:46,417 --> 00:40:50,197
I want to hold you close. You don't mind that, do you?

396
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:54,716
What do you mean?

397
00:40:54,916 --> 00:40:58,015
Sometimes people don't say exactly
what they mean

398
00:40:58,115 --> 00:41:01,265
And you have been guilty of this all evening.

399
00:41:05,915 --> 00:41:08,414
Now, I'll tell you something.

400
00:41:08,714 --> 00:41:10,114
And I will mean,

401
00:41:10,214 --> 00:41:13,514
...everything I say.

402
00:41:15,113 --> 00:41:17,913
My wife is not a free agent.

403
00:41:18,113 --> 00:41:20,313
I don't allow her that.

404
00:41:21,113 --> 00:41:23,512
The bonds of marriage are real bonds.

405
00:41:23,612 --> 00:41:25,612
The vows we take,

406
00:41:25,647 --> 00:41:28,912
...we honor and enforce them.

407
00:41:28,913 --> 00:41:33,312
For our selves, by ourselves, or,

408
00:41:33,911 --> 00:41:37,911
if necessary,
they are enforced for us.

409
00:41:39,111 --> 00:41:40,545
Either way, she is...

410
00:41:40,645 --> 00:41:42,645
...bound.

411
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:45,510
Do you understand this?

412
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:53,909
There are consequences to one's actions.

413
00:41:54,009 --> 00:41:58,408
And there would, for certain, be consequences to...

414
00:41:58,608 --> 00:42:00,608
...wrong actions.

415
00:42:02,008 --> 00:42:04,008
Dark, they would be, and...

416
00:42:04,408 --> 00:42:07,007
...inescapable.

417
00:42:10,907 --> 00:42:13,506
why instigate a need to suffer?

418
00:42:40,503 --> 00:42:42,703
Bucky J, are you there?

419
00:42:42,803 --> 00:42:45,303
- Is he there?
- Yes, he is there.

420
00:42:45,403 --> 00:42:48,502
I'd say we haven't still got the 2K quite in the right place

421
00:42:48,602 --> 00:42:52,202
I think I'd say up about 2 feet, you'd know better than me.

422
00:42:52,302 --> 00:42:53,702
But it's still...

423
00:42:53,802 --> 00:42:56,801
Boss, you want the 2K down?

424
00:42:58,001 --> 00:42:58,601
Want it down?

425
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:03,401
Yeah, I'd say about 2 foot down Bucky.

426
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,240
How much you want it to do down?

427
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,500
Yeah, a bit more...

428
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,200
- Keep...
- How far?

429
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,099
Another foot Bucky.

430
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:15,599
I haven't even touched it yet.

431
00:43:15,799 --> 00:43:21,198
Well then put it 2 foot from where it is...
no, a foot down from where it is Bucky.

432
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:22,898
'... oss'.

433
00:43:22,998 --> 00:43:24,498
What?

434
00:43:24,598 --> 00:43:26,698
Got it, boss.

435
00:43:28,798 --> 00:43:32,497
Bucky, I... Bucky just lower it 2 foot, would you?

436
00:43:32,597 --> 00:43:33,532
From there.

437
00:43:33,632 --> 00:43:35,632
No, Bucky.
It's going up.

438
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:38,596
I want it down, Bucky,
Two foot lower.

439
00:43:38,696 --> 00:43:40,996
This goddamn time I had a cramp

440
00:43:41,096 --> 00:43:43,546
Just a minute, I'm getting on it...

441
00:43:48,195 --> 00:43:49,895
Thank you Bucky.

442
00:43:49,995 --> 00:43:53,495
Does we it in something else...
- go talk to him...

443
00:43:53,695 --> 00:43:57,094
Just uh... relax for a minute.

444
00:44:03,593 --> 00:44:07,493
Listen, get medics on the scene, and see what's behind this.

445
00:44:07,593 --> 00:44:10,293
- Yes, but. who..

446
00:44:10,393 --> 00:44:11,727
...Phil's on it.

447
00:44:11,827 --> 00:44:14,992
- Phil's in... We got Phil up there now, Bucky J doin a deal.
- Ok

448
00:44:15,092 --> 00:44:20,972
- Please guys, lets work on these lighting cues,
alright, we need to work together...

449
00:44:21,691 --> 00:44:25,091
We're almost lit,
couple of minutets

450
00:44:25,191 --> 00:44:27,391
Alright, Tim and Sally, five minute warning,
five minute warning.

451
00:44:27,491 --> 00:44:32,590
Last looks on first team please,
five minute warning.

452
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:36,089
Lockups go to place please,
lockups to place.

453
00:44:40,389 --> 00:44:44,289
I'm heading out, you need anything?

454
00:44:45,088 --> 00:44:47,088
Quittin time already?

455
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:49,688
Passed.

456
00:44:55,287 --> 00:44:56,987
Wanna stay for a drink?

457
00:44:57,087 --> 00:45:00,587
Naw, I'm late for gym.
- Gym?

458
00:45:01,786 --> 00:45:05,386
Is that with a 'g' or a 'j'?

459
00:45:05,586 --> 00:45:07,586
Oh, that's original.

460
00:45:07,586 --> 00:45:10,385
'G'

461
00:45:11,985 --> 00:45:13,985
what do you do...

462
00:45:14,185 --> 00:45:16,185
...at the gym?

463
00:45:16,485 --> 00:45:18,485
I exercise!

464
00:45:19,184 --> 00:45:21,384
why would you do that?

465
00:45:21,984 --> 00:45:23,984
See ya

466
00:45:25,384 --> 00:45:28,083
Stay for one little drink?

467
00:45:29,183 --> 00:45:31,583
I'm so lonely...

468
00:45:32,283 --> 00:45:35,482
Oh, poor small infant child...

469
00:45:38,382 --> 00:45:40,382
One?

470
00:45:44,581 --> 00:45:47,281
Damn

471
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,880
Will there be anything else?

472
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:05,579
- No, thank you, Jim.
- My pleasure.

473
00:46:22,777 --> 00:46:25,177
You want to stay for dinner?

474
00:46:26,976 --> 00:46:28,976
Maybe

475
00:46:29,076 --> 00:46:31,076
I think you should.

476
00:46:31,576 --> 00:46:33,576
You do?

477
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:36,375
I really do.

478
00:46:41,675 --> 00:46:43,974
This is a nice drink.

479
00:46:46,474 --> 00:46:48,474
Nice fire.

480
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:52,473
wife and children gone..

481
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,272
You talk too much.

482
00:47:02,972 --> 00:47:06,172
So sorry, baby.

483
00:47:09,071 --> 00:47:12,171
Don't ruin this...

484
00:47:15,471 --> 00:47:19,170
There's nothing to ruin Billy.

485
00:47:31,969 --> 00:47:33,368
Done cut.

486
00:47:33,468 --> 00:47:36,468
We copy cut.
Check gate.

487
00:47:44,767 --> 00:47:47,267
Yeah, I was right. Did anyone else read
the script?

488
00:47:47,367 --> 00:47:51,566
The light should fade after Billy's line, do you see?

489
00:47:52,966 --> 00:47:53,866
Look.

490
00:47:53,966 --> 00:47:57,886
Alright alright, we go again please!
Back to 1 everybody!

491
00:48:06,064 --> 00:48:07,464
A car...

492
00:48:07,564 --> 00:48:10,564
A click Al, it wasn't a car, it was a 'click'.

493
00:48:10,664 --> 00:48:12,564
Guys on lockup outside, can we work on that please?

494
00:48:12,664 --> 00:48:17,463
Really, I can't have cars going by without...
No, we had ITC...

495
00:48:17,563 --> 00:48:22,813
I don't think it was... It's something in the wire...
Will you pick that up?

496
00:48:26,762 --> 00:48:30,162
Thanks. I've got a lot of nerve, I know...

497
00:48:30,362 --> 00:48:34,562
...it seems that only yesterday Iwas carrying my own weight.

498
00:48:36,061 --> 00:48:37,461
Thanks, Devon.

499
00:48:37,561 --> 00:48:39,561
My pleasure...

500
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:45,360
That is exactly what we need.

501
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,559
- Camera department, you guys ready?
- Yeah

502
00:48:53,659 --> 00:48:55,759
- OK.
- Where you gonna go sir?

503
00:48:55,794 --> 00:48:56,593
Can I have some coffee?

504
00:48:56,693 --> 00:48:59,258
Yeah, coffee comming in..

505
00:49:02,058 --> 00:49:06,398
After shooting, do you want to go get
something to eat with me?

506
00:49:12,857 --> 00:49:16,656
I bet you know a cute little Italian resaurant.

507
00:49:17,956 --> 00:49:19,756
Tucked away,

508
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:23,355
private, great food.

509
00:49:24,955 --> 00:49:28,155
I do!

510
00:49:29,155 --> 00:49:31,554
How did you know that?

511
00:49:33,354 --> 00:49:35,454
Did I say a night?

512
00:49:45,053 --> 00:49:46,153
They're ready for you.

513
00:49:46,253 --> 00:49:49,052
Wait just a minute.

514
00:50:01,351 --> 00:50:04,650
I'll see you after the shoot.

515
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:13,350
Good luck and run...

516
00:50:13,549 --> 00:50:15,549
And action!

517
00:50:57,144 --> 00:50:59,144
Billy.

518
00:51:10,742 --> 00:51:13,242
Is it this what you want?

519
00:51:20,341 --> 00:51:23,441
I won't fall in love with you.

520
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:49,438
And cut!

521
00:51:50,638 --> 00:51:52,638
Are you two happy?

522
00:52:09,535 --> 00:52:11,535
What?

523
00:52:12,635 --> 00:52:14,635
I don't know.

524
00:52:16,835 --> 00:52:18,835
Tell me.

525
00:52:20,634 --> 00:52:22,634
What?

526
00:52:24,234 --> 00:52:26,234
Something's happened.

527
00:52:26,533 --> 00:52:28,983
I think my husband knows about you.

528
00:52:29,033 --> 00:52:31,233
About us

529
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:33,833
He'll kill you...
and me...

530
00:52:34,233 --> 00:52:36,233
He'll...

531
00:52:38,332 --> 00:52:41,692
Damn... it sounds like dialogue from our script!

532
00:52:42,732 --> 00:52:44,732
Cut. Cut it!

533
00:52:45,031 --> 00:52:47,031
What's going on?

534
00:52:49,031 --> 00:52:49,731
What?

535
00:52:49,831 --> 00:52:54,430
What the bloody hell is going on?

536
00:53:08,428 --> 00:53:11,628
And we just don't know the actual, real reasons.

537
00:53:11,728 --> 00:53:14,038
...why this film wasn't finished.

538
00:53:14,528 --> 00:53:17,527
Now, you know some stories,

539
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:20,927
But stories are stories.
Hollywood is full of them.

540
00:53:21,027 --> 00:53:21,862
Thank God.

541
00:53:21,962 --> 00:53:24,227
In this case, the same thing.

542
00:53:24,327 --> 00:53:27,126
Stories which grew out of imagination.

543
00:53:27,726 --> 00:53:31,326
And we're surrounded by these
old stories every day

544
00:53:32,026 --> 00:53:35,946
And they shouldn't be taken as truth.
Or given creedence.

545
00:53:36,125 --> 00:53:39,525
Or jeapordize Nikki's performance.

546
00:53:41,325 --> 00:53:43,124
Unless the stories are true.

547
00:53:43,224 --> 00:53:45,224
Devon...

548
00:53:49,724 --> 00:53:54,723
There is absolutely no proof that anyting
bad happened around this film.

549
00:54:25,519 --> 00:54:28,219
Tie me on and I'll come.

550
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:30,519
Wait, stop, stop baby...

551
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,620
Oh, God! Oh yeah. Oh God Damn.

552
00:54:41,017 --> 00:54:42,452
Ok, our first time...

553
00:54:42,552 --> 00:54:45,017
...fuck and it's good.
Oh, please

554
00:54:45,117 --> 00:54:47,357
Babe, you talk too fuckin' much.

555
00:54:48,417 --> 00:54:52,407
- Are you gonna talk through this whole thing?.
- Oh yeah.

556
00:54:57,515 --> 00:54:59,515
It's time.

557
00:55:18,513 --> 00:55:20,013
Remember...

558
00:55:20,113 --> 00:55:21,813
Rembember that thing

559
00:55:21,913 --> 00:55:26,412
When I said that thing about me...

560
00:55:26,812 --> 00:55:28,412
Remember that?

561
00:55:28,512 --> 00:55:30,612
Yeah...

562
00:55:35,811 --> 00:55:40,151
Remember I told you, about this thing
this thing that happened.

563
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:45,510
It's a story that happened yesterday.

564
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:48,309
But I know that it's tomorrow.

565
00:55:48,909 --> 00:55:50,509
That doesn't make sense

566
00:55:50,609 --> 00:55:51,909
It was that scene...

567
00:55:52,009 --> 00:55:53,609
...that we did yesterday.

568
00:55:53,709 --> 00:55:56,408
When I'm getting groceries for you
with your car

569
00:55:56,508 --> 00:55:59,808
And I was in that alley, and I parked the
car, there's always parking there.

570
00:55:59,908 --> 00:56:01,743
...So there I am...

571
00:56:01,843 --> 00:56:05,307
What?
Sue, damn!

572
00:56:08,607 --> 00:56:10,707
It's a scene we did yesterday.

573
00:56:10,707 --> 00:56:12,507
You weren't in it.

574
00:56:12,607 --> 00:56:17,906
That one where I'm in the alley, I'm going to get
groceries for you with your car.

575
00:56:18,006 --> 00:56:20,606
And I parked there 'cause there's always
parking.

576
00:56:20,706 --> 00:56:22,405
You know the one?

577
00:56:22,505 --> 00:56:25,305
I see this writing on metal.

578
00:56:25,306 --> 00:56:29,506
And I started remembering something...
I'm remembering...

579
00:56:29,604 --> 00:56:33,604
This whole thing starts floodin' in...
this whole memory.

580
00:56:35,504 --> 00:56:39,503
I start to remember...
And I... I don't know...

581
00:56:39,703 --> 00:56:43,203
I do not know what it is...

582
00:56:43,303 --> 00:56:48,302
It's me, Devon, it's me...
Nikki...

583
00:56:49,202 --> 00:56:51,202
That doesn't make any sense

584
00:56:52,302 --> 00:56:54,302
What is this?

585
00:56:55,501 --> 00:56:59,401
It's me, Devon, it's me...
Nikki...

586
00:56:59,901 --> 00:57:02,901
Look at me, you fucker!

587
00:57:12,499 --> 00:57:15,599
Please, please

588
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:17,899
Please

589
00:57:17,999 --> 00:57:19,999
Forgive me.

590
00:57:22,498 --> 00:57:24,498
Please

591
00:59:22,384 --> 00:59:24,384
Look in the other room...

592
00:59:25,684 --> 00:59:26,983
What the hell is that?

593
00:59:27,083 --> 00:59:27,883
Freddy!

594
00:59:27,983 --> 00:59:29,983
No, somebody's over there.

595
00:59:34,782 --> 00:59:38,142
The stage is supposed to be ours and ours alone.

596
00:59:42,482 --> 00:59:44,482
I'll go look

597
00:59:46,981 --> 00:59:48,981
- I'm sorry
- It's ok..

598
01:00:47,774 --> 01:00:49,774
Billy!

599
01:00:53,473 --> 01:00:55,473
Billy!

600
01:00:55,473 --> 01:00:57,473
Billy!

601
01:01:29,969 --> 01:01:31,969
Billy!

602
01:01:35,668 --> 01:01:37,668
Billy!

603
01:01:40,967 --> 01:01:42,967
Billy!

604
01:01:46,967 --> 01:01:48,967
Billy!

605
01:06:27,133 --> 01:06:29,133
Who the hell are you?

606
01:06:32,833 --> 01:06:34,632
Hey!

607
01:06:34,732 --> 01:06:38,132
Look at us and tell us
if you've known us before.

608
01:06:40,432 --> 01:06:42,432
There was a man...

609
01:06:42,532 --> 01:06:44,532
...I once knew

610
01:06:48,531 --> 01:06:52,330
Was it like this.. look around.

611
01:06:54,630 --> 01:06:58,830
Did he do that thing... you know
that little shaking thing?

612
01:06:59,330 --> 01:07:01,979
While he was...

613
01:07:02,014 --> 01:07:04,629
You know...

614
01:07:07,629 --> 01:07:09,629
Wasn't that great...

615
01:07:11,428 --> 01:07:13,428
Yeah

616
01:07:19,127 --> 01:07:20,527
I'd let him do...

617
01:07:20,627 --> 01:07:24,327
...anything

618
01:07:48,224 --> 01:07:50,023
Strange...

619
01:07:50,123 --> 01:07:52,123
...what love does.

620
01:07:57,323 --> 01:08:00,322
So strange.

621
01:08:06,422 --> 01:08:08,422
In the bedroom

622
01:08:10,421 --> 01:08:15,320
- You'll be dreaming...
- The kind of sleep...

623
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:20,020
When you open the eyes...

624
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:24,319
someone familiar will be there.

625
01:09:08,214 --> 01:09:10,214
This is the street.

626
01:09:15,513 --> 01:09:18,113
Do you want to see?

627
01:09:28,912 --> 01:09:31,911
Just down the way.

628
01:10:03,408 --> 01:10:05,408
It was...

629
01:10:05,442 --> 01:10:07,442
...to see...

630
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:13,407
Very pretty...

631
01:10:13,441 --> 01:10:15,441
I know...

632
01:10:17,406 --> 01:10:21,305
Pick a cigarette.

633
01:10:21,405 --> 01:10:24,905
Erase him in the white silk.

634
01:10:31,304 --> 01:10:33,304
Arrive closer

635
01:10:33,804 --> 01:10:35,804
It approximate

636
01:10:37,903 --> 01:10:41,403
And it look...

637
01:10:41,438 --> 01:10:44,503
...through of the hole.

638
01:12:45,588 --> 01:12:47,588
Breakfast

639
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,300
I didn't mean anything by that.
I just asked a question.

640
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:01,600
Why did you ask if it means nothing?
Whatever you want, is that it?

641
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:03,700
No, whatever you want.

642
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:06,600
Oh... Now it's me!

643
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:09,900
Always you.

644
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:14,600
Lie to me, but don't lie to yourself.
So sly...

645
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:19,600
- Don't push me!
- I'll push you to hell!

646
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,800
Stop it!

647
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:24,770
I can't give you children, I know that...

648
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:29,620
- Are you listening to me?
- I'm going out now.

649
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:34,700
I'm not who you think I am!
I'll never let you have her!

650
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:45,400
Never!

651
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Never!

652
01:16:11,050 --> 01:16:14,700
- Excuse me, do you know the time?
- 9:45.

653
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Thank you.

654
01:18:41,946 --> 01:18:45,945
I don't really understand what I'm doing here.

655
01:18:50,045 --> 01:18:53,944
That's one hell of a fuckin' climb getting up here.

656
01:18:56,444 --> 01:19:00,544
So I was told you could help me.

657
01:19:11,442 --> 01:19:14,242
I guess I'll just tell you the thing..

658
01:19:15,342 --> 01:19:18,741
I just know that am I.

659
01:19:36,839 --> 01:19:38,839
There was this man...

660
01:19:40,339 --> 01:19:44,138
...I once knew...

661
01:19:44,338 --> 01:19:46,438
His name was...

662
01:19:47,738 --> 01:19:50,938
It doesn't matter what his name was...

663
01:19:53,337 --> 01:19:56,637
A lot of guys change.

664
01:19:57,037 --> 01:19:59,417
They don't change, but they reveal

665
01:20:01,536 --> 01:20:04,406
In time they reveal what they really are.

666
01:20:04,636 --> 01:20:07,736
You know what I mean?

667
01:20:09,535 --> 01:20:12,935
It is an old story.

668
01:20:14,835 --> 01:20:16,835
Well this guy...

669
01:20:17,334 --> 01:20:20,234
...he revealed something.

670
01:20:21,834 --> 01:20:23,834
Looking back on it...

671
01:20:26,333 --> 01:20:29,833
All along it was being revealed.

672
01:20:32,833 --> 01:20:35,932
He was planning something...

673
01:20:36,732 --> 01:20:40,232
...planning something with me in mind.

674
01:20:51,830 --> 01:20:55,730
When I get mad,
I really get mad

675
01:20:57,330 --> 01:21:02,329
I gouged a man's eye out when I
was 15 once, he was trying to rape me...

676
01:21:02,429 --> 01:21:05,999
I mean, the fucker had it out
pushing my legs apart.

677
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:09,709
I got a finger on his eyes socket,

678
01:21:09,728 --> 01:21:13,368
pretty quick, rape was quite a long
way off his mind.

679
01:21:15,628 --> 01:21:18,428
He was crying and screaming like a baby.

680
01:21:19,127 --> 01:21:21,927
'What a fuckin man you are,' I said.

681
01:21:25,826 --> 01:21:27,826
There was goo...

682
01:21:28,226 --> 01:21:31,376
He still could still see me with the one eye.

683
01:21:31,426 --> 01:21:36,025
See me comin' at him, grabbin' his nuts
and tearin' at 'em.

684
01:21:37,825 --> 01:21:40,345
He'd seen that alright, felt it too.

685
01:21:41,624 --> 01:21:44,984
He was screamin' and wailin' like a little baby.

686
01:21:46,924 --> 01:21:49,624
He sat in the corner cryin'

687
01:21:49,923 --> 01:21:53,623
Alone and huggin' his nuts 'till the ambulance come

688
01:21:54,923 --> 01:21:57,723
the ambulance guys, they say:

689
01:21:57,823 --> 01:22:00,822
'What the fuck happened here?'

690
01:22:02,822 --> 01:22:04,022
I say:

691
01:22:04,122 --> 01:22:08,532
...'He come to a reapin' what he had been sowin', that's what.'

692
01:22:09,021 --> 01:22:11,021
They say:

693
01:22:11,321 --> 01:22:14,721
'Fucker been sowing some kind of heavy shit...'

694
01:22:56,216 --> 01:22:58,216
It's the shits...

695
01:23:01,815 --> 01:23:04,685
I really thought you would last, you two.

696
01:23:06,414 --> 01:23:09,014
I saw it coming...

697
01:23:11,114 --> 01:23:13,913
Sorry, I did!

698
01:23:15,413 --> 01:23:18,313
You're full of shit Dorry...

699
01:23:28,612 --> 01:23:30,612
Sucks... He was the one...

700
01:23:31,211 --> 01:23:34,511
I really thought he was,
you know?

701
01:23:39,110 --> 01:23:41,910
So what He's gone

702
01:23:43,910 --> 01:23:45,910
Find someone else

703
01:23:49,109 --> 01:23:52,109
It is not easy when you feel like shit...

704
01:23:54,309 --> 01:23:56,408
Oh, baby...

705
01:24:01,808 --> 01:24:03,808
Tonight we'll change that.

706
01:24:04,007 --> 01:24:06,507
Yeah. Tonight it will be good.

707
01:24:07,107 --> 01:24:10,677
There's always a chance
with tits like yours, Kerri.

708
01:24:11,307 --> 01:24:13,307
Thanks

709
01:24:15,806 --> 01:24:17,806
Tits

710
01:24:18,006 --> 01:24:20,006
Tits and ass.

711
01:24:31,304 --> 01:24:35,204
These are going to bring 'em in like sin

712
01:24:37,304 --> 01:24:41,703
- Pretty.

713
01:24:43,603 --> 01:24:47,502
They are pretty baby,
Nice.

714
01:24:49,502 --> 01:24:50,802
Sweet.

715
01:24:50,902 --> 01:24:52,902
Thanks guys

716
01:25:41,896 --> 01:25:44,995
I started saving some money
- Oh

717
01:25:46,095 --> 01:25:48,895
So now we rich?

718
01:25:49,695 --> 01:25:52,195
so I drink this piss called beer.

719
01:25:54,394 --> 01:25:56,794
What is the money for?

720
01:25:56,994 --> 01:26:00,894
If it won't bring something like hope?

721
01:26:17,992 --> 01:26:20,891
I'm pregnant.

722
01:26:25,591 --> 01:26:27,591
Oh... Funny one!

723
01:26:29,190 --> 01:26:32,190
I am pregnant.

724
01:26:39,489 --> 01:26:41,489
What is this?

725
01:26:43,089 --> 01:26:45,469
You don't seem too happy about it!

726
01:26:53,487 --> 01:26:55,487
Your pregnant?

727
01:27:03,286 --> 01:27:06,086
What is it?

728
01:27:07,086 --> 01:27:09,285
What's wrong?

729
01:27:15,885 --> 01:27:18,475
It just that it come as a shock to me

730
01:28:39,275 --> 01:28:41,275
Hello?

731
01:28:42,874 --> 01:28:44,874
Hello?

732
01:29:13,971 --> 01:29:15,971
Billy?

733
01:29:39,967 --> 01:29:43,967
I seen a man come at me with a crow bar once.

734
01:29:44,667 --> 01:29:48,666
Guess he figured I was two-timing him.

735
01:29:50,466 --> 01:29:52,466
I was coming home.

736
01:29:52,566 --> 01:29:55,766
We were shacked up at the time.

737
01:30:00,465 --> 01:30:03,865
He was waiting for me in the half-light.

738
01:30:07,464 --> 01:30:09,564
Waitin' for me to come home.

739
01:30:10,064 --> 01:30:13,564
I guess he worked himself
into some kind of frenzy.

740
01:30:13,763 --> 01:30:16,963
I opened the fuckin' door.

741
01:30:17,763 --> 01:30:21,473
And I seen his fuckin' shape burst out
of the chair...

742
01:30:22,562 --> 01:30:24,562
and a crow-bar goin up

743
01:30:24,762 --> 01:30:28,362
I screamed and turned

744
01:30:30,361 --> 01:30:32,461
Fuckin' crow bar comes down...

745
01:30:32,461 --> 01:30:36,261
...smashin' into that fuckin' door

746
01:30:36,361 --> 01:30:38,561
...cheap piece of shit...

747
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:41,650
...it just splinters into 1000 pieces

748
01:30:41,660 --> 01:30:44,960
...like it was glass, shit flyin' everywhere

749
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:48,559
I don't take this kind of behavior.

750
01:30:53,459 --> 01:30:55,658
I seen what this fucko is up to

751
01:30:56,558 --> 01:30:58,558
Bam!

752
01:30:59,458 --> 01:31:02,258
I kick him in the nuts so hard that
they go crawling into his brain

753
01:31:02,358 --> 01:31:03,892
...for refuge.

754
01:31:03,992 --> 01:31:07,057
He goes down like a $2 whore.

755
01:31:07,357 --> 01:31:13,097
...cryin' and shit and tell me that he's
never done nothing but love me bullshit...

756
01:31:15,456 --> 01:31:19,456
Were you in fact seeing another man?

757
01:31:22,055 --> 01:31:25,695
I was screwing a couple guys for drinks,
no big deal.

758
01:31:30,454 --> 01:31:33,154
This one guy, he was kinda cute

759
01:31:33,754 --> 01:31:39,984
Fucker had a dick like a rhinocerous.
He'd fuck the shit out of you, I'll tell you what...

760
01:31:44,953 --> 01:31:47,543
He'd buy me a couple of drinks after.

761
01:31:52,252 --> 01:31:53,752
We'd talk.

762
01:31:53,852 --> 01:31:57,051
He'd tell me about a town he grew up in.

763
01:31:57,351 --> 01:32:00,851
All the little girls he'd fuck

764
01:32:02,051 --> 01:32:05,621
There was a chemical factory in this town
and, uh...

765
01:32:06,850 --> 01:32:12,240
Telling us it was putting so much shit
in the air you couldn't think straight.

766
01:32:13,649 --> 01:32:15,949
I got to a lot of the people.

767
01:32:18,349 --> 01:32:21,648
there was a lot of crazy shit going on there.

768
01:32:23,248 --> 01:32:26,048
People having weird dreams, and...

769
01:32:28,347 --> 01:32:31,147
...seeing things that wasn't there.

770
01:32:33,747 --> 01:32:37,046
So one time, this one little girl...

771
01:32:39,546 --> 01:32:42,046
...she was starin' off at somethin' one time...

772
01:32:42,146 --> 01:32:44,146
...starts screaming

773
01:32:44,945 --> 01:32:48,945
They.. the... people hanging around,
they come to her and

774
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:52,745
...ask her what's wrong, and uh...

775
01:32:56,544 --> 01:32:59,274
She says she sees the end of the world.

776
01:33:01,743 --> 01:33:04,743
...on fire, and smoke and blood rain'.

777
01:33:05,243 --> 01:33:08,143
You know, like they say...

778
01:33:10,042 --> 01:33:13,642
The wailing and the gnashing of teeth.

779
01:33:16,192 --> 01:33:18,192
Hey!

780
01:33:22,341 --> 01:33:24,341
Look at me!

781
01:33:24,641 --> 01:33:27,640
And I tell me if you've known me before.

782
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:35,139
Yes,
we will do that.

783
01:33:47,238 --> 01:33:49,238
Where is the paper towels?

784
01:34:09,335 --> 01:34:12,335
They're behind you, on the table.

785
01:34:25,134 --> 01:34:30,033
It removes myself...
from this sinful dream...

786
01:34:32,533 --> 01:34:35,932
...which invaded my heart.

787
01:35:59,522 --> 01:36:01,522
Who is she?

788
01:36:07,621 --> 01:36:09,621
Who is she?

789
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:42,700
I almost didn't recognize you

790
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:48,100
You startled me

791
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:53,700
Strange...to find you on the street

792
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:01,600
You seem upset.

793
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:04,900
Are you?

794
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:07,800
Should I be?

795
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:12,600
- No, but...
- So I shouldn't be?

796
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:17,600
No

797
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:19,600
But still, you seem so

798
01:37:22,100 --> 01:37:24,200
I think you don't recognize me

799
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:30,460
I think you don't recognize my manners

800
01:37:33,100 --> 01:37:35,100
That's true

801
01:37:35,900 --> 01:37:39,000
- You seem different
- You too

802
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:48,800
I'm used to seeing you in our home,
not on the street,

803
01:37:51,050 --> 01:37:53,050
at night

804
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:56,600
Me too

805
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:07,100
There was a murder

806
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:13,100
How awful!

807
01:38:14,300 --> 01:38:16,600
- Where?
- Just down the way

808
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:20,200
I think...

809
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:22,600
...you knew the victim

810
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:28,000
- Who was it?
- Don't know the name

811
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:33,120
But I have seen you with this person

812
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:39,400
- You have?
- Yes

813
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:44,570
I think I've seen the two of you together

814
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:55,400
That's awful

815
01:39:22,498 --> 01:39:24,498
Who are those people?

816
01:39:24,798 --> 01:39:26,798
Hey, hello!

817
01:39:27,997 --> 01:39:29,997
Good to see you.

818
01:39:29,997 --> 01:39:31,332
Come in, come in.

819
01:39:31,432 --> 01:39:34,190
Get some hot-dog.

820
01:39:37,196 --> 01:39:39,796
You said 3 o'clock.

821
01:39:40,596 --> 01:39:42,596
Yes, that's right.

822
01:39:43,396 --> 01:39:45,396
You're right on time.

823
01:39:47,801 --> 01:39:50,251
The situation is becoming dangerous

824
01:39:55,965 --> 01:39:56,765
Give me my hammer.

825
01:39:56,865 --> 01:39:58,865
Give me that!

826
01:39:59,065 --> 01:40:01,065
Gives me now.

827
01:40:06,565 --> 01:40:09,558
Did you see?

828
01:40:24,065 --> 01:40:26,465
There is no paper.
For the toilet.

829
01:40:26,964 --> 01:40:28,964
There is no paper.

830
01:40:29,465 --> 01:40:33,558
It is under the sink,
in the cupboard.

831
01:40:45,964 --> 01:40:47,964
what?

832
01:40:51,765 --> 01:40:55,265
They are a group that performs in
travelling shows.

833
01:40:55,364 --> 01:40:58,057
In the Baltic region

834
01:41:00,664 --> 01:41:03,964
What's that got to do with you?

835
01:41:04,664 --> 01:41:07,758
I will care for the animals.

836
01:41:14,064 --> 01:41:17,757
It was said that I have a way with animals.

837
01:41:27,064 --> 01:41:30,364
Fucker went to some eastern europe shithole

838
01:41:30,864 --> 01:41:33,857
...with the fuckin' circus.

839
01:41:36,664 --> 01:41:39,455
Can you fuckin believe that?

840
01:41:42,663 --> 01:41:44,663
That circus...

841
01:41:44,663 --> 01:41:49,557
...talk about carnies... Carnies, gypsies,
conmen, you name it.

842
01:41:50,863 --> 01:41:53,356
A real fuckin' ball of shit.

843
01:42:00,363 --> 01:42:03,303
There was this guy they had working there.

844
01:42:06,264 --> 01:42:08,264
He'd start talkin'.

845
01:42:08,363 --> 01:42:10,756
...you know, real regular.

846
01:42:11,957 --> 01:42:13,957
Talkin' up the crowd.

847
01:42:13,963 --> 01:42:15,963
They'd start listening...

848
01:42:16,163 --> 01:42:19,063
... Pushin' in closer.

849
01:42:20,163 --> 01:42:23,256
He did some sort of thing on people.

850
01:42:26,763 --> 01:42:29,656
They all called him the phantom.

851
01:42:33,863 --> 01:42:37,263
He got in a bar room fight one night...

852
01:42:37,863 --> 01:42:39,663
All the bar was arrested.

853
01:42:39,763 --> 01:42:43,055
A lot of them fuckin' circus clowns.

854
01:42:46,363 --> 01:42:49,583
So when they take 'em all down to the station,

855
01:42:49,862 --> 01:42:51,862
Guess what?...

856
01:42:53,363 --> 01:42:55,763
...the Phantom's done gone and disappeared.

857
01:42:55,863 --> 01:42:58,873
This is the kind of shit I'm talking about.

858
01:43:07,862 --> 01:43:10,553
He was a marine from North Carolina.

859
01:43:14,363 --> 01:43:16,862
I had a sister with one leg.

860
01:43:16,962 --> 01:43:21,255
...she had a sort of carved stick for the other one.

861
01:43:25,262 --> 01:43:29,362
She killed three kids in the first grade.

862
01:43:29,462 --> 01:43:32,855
This is the kind of shit.

863
01:43:43,362 --> 01:43:45,362
Fuckin' funny.

864
01:43:48,861 --> 01:43:50,861
People.

865
01:43:51,662 --> 01:43:54,162
All got their own peculiarities.

866
01:43:55,062 --> 01:43:57,754
Their own way of livin'

867
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:17,160
What about school?

868
01:46:17,260 --> 01:46:19,260
One more day.

869
01:46:19,959 --> 01:46:21,759
One more day?

870
01:46:21,859 --> 01:46:23,859
Maybe two.

871
01:46:32,359 --> 01:46:34,359
Susan?

872
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:37,652
What are you doing here?

873
01:46:42,259 --> 01:46:43,560
What?

874
01:46:43,660 --> 01:46:45,660
I thought you were gone.

875
01:46:56,759 --> 01:46:58,759
Billy.

876
01:47:00,859 --> 01:47:02,859
Billy.

877
01:47:04,359 --> 01:47:05,494
Something's wrong.

878
01:47:05,594 --> 01:47:07,750
Bad wrong.
Do you feel it?

879
01:47:14,359 --> 01:47:16,359
Sue?

880
01:47:16,659 --> 01:47:18,558
Billy.

881
01:47:18,658 --> 01:47:20,658
Do you love me?

882
01:47:21,159 --> 01:47:23,159
what?

883
01:47:26,958 --> 01:47:28,658
Billy.

884
01:47:28,758 --> 01:47:30,758
Sue.

885
01:47:31,959 --> 01:47:35,651
Don't you remember anything?
How it was?

886
01:47:37,258 --> 01:47:40,408
I don't understand what you're talking about.

887
01:47:42,359 --> 01:47:44,359
Are you kidding?

888
01:47:44,558 --> 01:47:46,558
No.

889
01:47:48,558 --> 01:47:50,558
You go on, Sue.

890
01:47:50,659 --> 01:47:52,458
You go on now...

891
01:47:52,558 --> 01:47:55,148
Would you like me to call the police?

892
01:47:55,358 --> 01:47:57,358
No, we can handle this.

893
01:48:05,158 --> 01:48:05,858
Billy.

894
01:48:05,958 --> 01:48:07,958
Something is wrong

895
01:48:08,258 --> 01:48:10,258
I love you, Billy.

896
01:48:10,558 --> 01:48:14,051
I've had just enough.

897
01:48:16,258 --> 01:48:18,258
I love you

898
01:48:20,258 --> 01:48:22,258
Go away, Susan.

899
01:48:22,258 --> 01:48:24,258
I love you

900
01:48:25,657 --> 01:48:27,657
Sue!

901
01:48:29,058 --> 01:48:31,058
I don't care

902
01:48:31,158 --> 01:48:33,351
It's something more.

903
01:48:39,858 --> 01:48:43,350
I do not care It's something more.

904
01:50:39,001 --> 01:50:41,001
Gordy

905
01:50:45,401 --> 01:50:47,401
What do you want?

906
01:50:50,581 --> 01:50:52,581
Where is he?

907
01:50:53,001 --> 01:50:56,201
What's the point?
Are you blind? He's gone!

908
01:51:00,001 --> 01:51:02,001
Everybody?

909
01:51:04,301 --> 01:51:07,101
Why answer your stupid question?

910
01:51:07,601 --> 01:51:10,121
You're nothing! You've done nothing!

911
01:51:16,101 --> 01:51:18,101
Where did he go?

912
01:51:20,201 --> 01:51:24,351
No idea. He talked... mumbled
something about Inland Empire.

913
01:53:11,553 --> 01:53:15,347
I come about an unpaid bill that needs payin'

914
01:53:20,853 --> 01:53:22,853
All right

915
01:53:29,153 --> 01:53:34,147
Do you know a man who lives here?

916
01:53:52,753 --> 01:53:54,753
Do you know him?

917
01:53:55,153 --> 01:53:58,144
Yes. What is it? What do you want?

918
01:53:58,853 --> 01:54:01,545
Which you want?

919
01:54:05,153 --> 01:54:09,546
He has an unpaid bill that needs payin'

920
01:54:10,352 --> 01:54:14,246
You already said that.

921
01:54:19,052 --> 01:54:21,712
Do you know a man who lives next door?

922
01:54:21,853 --> 01:54:24,644
Crimp is the name...

923
01:54:33,053 --> 01:54:35,545
It was a funny name.

924
01:54:36,452 --> 01:54:40,145
They was called Crimp.

925
01:55:08,552 --> 01:55:10,552
Hey?

926
01:56:43,001 --> 01:56:45,251
There's someone there

927
01:56:47,001 --> 01:56:49,001
I have to tell you

928
01:56:50,351 --> 01:56:52,351
There's someone

929
01:57:07,001 --> 01:57:09,001
Do you recognize her?

930
01:57:14,551 --> 01:57:16,551
I don't see her

931
01:57:19,001 --> 01:57:21,521
You understand she was sent for you?

932
01:57:22,601 --> 01:57:24,601
I don't know where I am

933
01:57:37,101 --> 01:57:39,701
- I hear her now
- Do you see her?

934
01:57:42,301 --> 01:57:44,301
No

935
01:57:45,601 --> 01:57:47,601
It was...

936
01:57:51,001 --> 01:57:53,001
...red

937
01:57:59,101 --> 01:58:01,101
You work for someone?

938
01:58:04,101 --> 01:58:06,101
Yes

939
01:58:07,801 --> 01:58:10,301
The one she spoke of

940
01:58:15,101 --> 01:58:17,101
Yes, I work for him

941
01:58:18,301 --> 01:58:20,301
So you understand

942
01:58:24,601 --> 01:58:26,601
The horse was taken...

943
01:58:28,101 --> 01:58:30,101
...to the well

944
01:58:45,901 --> 01:58:47,901
Take the pistol

945
01:58:50,801 --> 01:58:52,801
Let's go!

946
01:59:04,801 --> 01:59:07,201
Right away! It's past midnight!

947
02:00:17,648 --> 02:00:21,640
I am going to find out one day.

948
02:00:25,848 --> 02:00:27,848
It was red.

949
02:00:32,747 --> 02:00:34,747
Where was I?

950
02:00:40,247 --> 02:00:44,240
This isn't the way it was.

951
02:00:58,347 --> 02:01:01,839
It was the man in the green coat.

952
02:01:04,647 --> 02:01:09,340
It had something to do with
the telling of time.

953
02:02:20,646 --> 02:02:22,646
I am a whore.

954
02:02:27,645 --> 02:02:29,645
Where am I?

955
02:02:29,645 --> 02:02:31,937
I'm afraid

956
02:04:28,444 --> 02:04:32,336
Just a moment.

957
02:04:36,144 --> 02:04:39,037
I need to make a collect call.

958
02:05:58,701 --> 02:06:00,701
Look at me

959
02:06:02,001 --> 02:06:04,591
And tell me if you've known me before

960
02:06:45,342 --> 02:06:50,242
Someone is gonna fuckin' kill me...
Someone is gonna fuckin' kill me...

961
02:06:59,342 --> 02:07:01,242
Someone is gonna fuckin' kill me...

962
02:07:01,342 --> 02:07:03,333
You gotta let me in. I know a girl.

963
02:07:03,433 --> 02:07:06,133
Carolina.
I know Carolina.

964
02:09:16,340 --> 02:09:22,920
- I don't really understand what I'm doing.
- It's one hell of a fuckin' climb getting up here.

965
02:09:24,140 --> 02:09:26,330
There was this man...

966
02:09:27,339 --> 02:09:31,033
...I once knew

967
02:09:34,339 --> 02:09:37,979
I'm trying to tell you so you understand
how it went.

968
02:09:41,740 --> 02:09:44,239
The thing is, I don't know...

969
02:09:44,339 --> 02:09:47,832
...what was before or after.

970
02:09:52,839 --> 02:09:55,429
I don't know what's happened first...

971
02:09:55,839 --> 02:09:59,332
...and it's kinda layin' a mindfuck on me.

972
02:10:09,639 --> 02:10:10,274
My husband...

973
02:10:10,374 --> 02:10:14,039
...he's fuckin' hidin' somethin'

974
02:10:15,039 --> 02:10:19,099
He was acting all fuckin' weird one
night before he left...

975
02:10:23,539 --> 02:10:27,129
He was talkin this foreign talk and...

976
02:10:28,639 --> 02:10:31,832
...tellin' loud fuckin' stories...

977
02:10:44,938 --> 02:10:47,332
I'm not who you think I am.

978
02:10:50,138 --> 02:10:52,138
Are you listening to me?

979
02:10:54,538 --> 02:10:56,629
I know it for a fact.

980
02:10:58,138 --> 02:11:02,031
I can't father children.

981
02:11:04,938 --> 02:11:10,531
Like this... his face all red...
his eyes buggin' out...

982
02:11:40,237 --> 02:11:42,737
I figured one day...

983
02:11:44,137 --> 02:11:46,138
...I'd just wake up and...

984
02:11:46,338 --> 02:11:50,330
...I find out what the hell yesterday
was all about.

985
02:11:54,538 --> 02:11:58,230
I'm not too keen on thinking about tomorrow.

986
02:12:00,537 --> 02:12:02,628
And today's slippin' by.

987
02:12:21,437 --> 02:12:23,730
I guess after my son died,

988
02:12:25,236 --> 02:12:27,236
I went into a bad time.

989
02:12:29,336 --> 02:12:34,796
When I was watching everything go around me
while I was standing in the middle.

990
02:12:41,136 --> 02:12:45,330
Watchin it, like in a dark theater.

991
02:12:47,836 --> 02:12:50,127
before they bring lights up.

992
02:12:55,336 --> 02:12:57,336
...I'm sittin there,

993
02:12:58,736 --> 02:13:00,736
...wonderin...

994
02:13:02,737 --> 02:13:05,027
...'how can this be?'

995
02:13:46,635 --> 02:13:48,235
Hello?

996
02:13:48,335 --> 02:13:51,627
Yeah, she's still here.

997
02:13:54,635 --> 02:13:57,785
I don't think it will be too much longer now.

998
02:13:59,536 --> 02:14:01,536
Yeah, the horse to the well.

999
02:14:02,535 --> 02:14:04,535
Yeah.

1000
02:14:07,535 --> 02:14:11,428
Yeah, he's around here someplace.

1001
02:14:14,735 --> 02:14:18,329
Sure, I'm on it.

1002
02:15:08,635 --> 02:15:10,635
What have you been up to?

1003
02:15:10,834 --> 02:15:12,834
Where did you go?

1004
02:15:15,535 --> 02:15:17,535
Where 'you been?

1005
02:15:22,834 --> 02:15:24,834
Someone's there.

1006
02:15:27,634 --> 02:15:29,634
Look.

1007
02:15:52,333 --> 02:15:54,725
Hey, watch this move!

1008
02:18:58,631 --> 02:19:01,224
You' dyin lady.

1009
02:19:29,930 --> 02:19:33,030
what you say about Pomona?

1010
02:19:34,031 --> 02:19:37,124
what you say about Pomona?

1011
02:19:38,330 --> 02:19:42,030
You asked about the bus.

1012
02:19:42,530 --> 02:19:46,024
Can't get no bus to Pamona.

1013
02:19:47,730 --> 02:19:50,530
You can get the bus for Pamona here.

1014
02:19:51,430 --> 02:19:54,624
If you get on the subway first.

1015
02:19:56,930 --> 02:20:00,123
I never can get no bus.

1016
02:20:04,130 --> 02:20:07,830
You can go all around Hollywood.

1017
02:20:07,930 --> 02:20:12,423
I was in Hollywood Irvine,

1018
02:20:12,630 --> 02:20:17,223
And you can get to Pomona for 3,50.

1019
02:20:17,224 --> 02:20:21,023
From Hollywood, Irvine to Pamona

1020
02:20:22,930 --> 02:20:26,030
I never heard of no bus there.

1021
02:20:27,830 --> 02:20:30,923
I ride on the bus to Pomona...

1022
02:20:30,930 --> 02:20:34,321
.. last summer to visit my friend...

1023
02:20:34,330 --> 02:20:38,220
.. who lives there.
Her name is Nico.

1024
02:20:38,255 --> 02:20:42,930
I stayed with her two weeks.

1025
02:20:44,730 --> 02:20:47,629
My cousin comes from Pomona.

1026
02:20:49,329 --> 02:20:53,623
She has a place there, and said
I can stay there.

1027
02:20:56,329 --> 02:20:58,822
What time is it

1028
02:21:00,830 --> 02:21:02,920
I don' know.

1029
02:21:04,429 --> 02:21:06,629
It's after midnight.

1030
02:21:07,429 --> 02:21:09,429
After midnight?

1031
02:21:10,330 --> 02:21:14,723
My friend Nico, who lives in Pomona...

1032
02:21:14,729 --> 02:21:20,422
...has a blonde wig.
she wears it at Paris.

1033
02:21:20,829 --> 02:21:26,429
but she's on hard drugs and turning tricks now.

1034
02:21:28,529 --> 02:21:32,422
She looks very good in her blonde wig...

1035
02:21:33,429 --> 02:21:35,229
just like a movie star.

1036
02:21:35,329 --> 02:21:38,429
Even girls fall in love with her.

1037
02:21:38,629 --> 02:21:42,822
When she's looking so good...

1038
02:21:43,629 --> 02:21:47,722
In her blonde star wig

1039
02:21:48,029 --> 02:21:52,329
She blows kisses and loves

1040
02:21:52,429 --> 02:21:58,522
But she has got a hole in her vagina wall

1041
02:22:00,329 --> 02:22:05,221
She has torn a hole

1042
02:22:06,128 --> 02:22:08,229
...into her intestine

1043
02:22:08,329 --> 02:22:10,628
...from her vagina.

1044
02:22:10,728 --> 02:22:11,828
Shit baby...

1045
02:22:11,928 --> 02:22:15,321
you didn't tell us that shit...

1046
02:22:16,829 --> 02:22:19,228
She has a shitty doctor,

1047
02:22:19,328 --> 02:22:22,119
But it is too expensive.

1048
02:22:24,328 --> 02:22:29,121
And now she knows her time has run out.

1049
02:22:31,528 --> 02:22:34,519
She scored a few more times,

1050
02:22:35,628 --> 02:22:39,321
And then, like that,

1051
02:22:39,328 --> 02:22:43,327
...she will stay at home, with her monkey.

1052
02:22:43,627 --> 02:22:46,328
It has a pet monkey.

1053
02:22:46,363 --> 02:22:51,427
This monkey shits everywhere,
But she doesn't care

1054
02:22:51,927 --> 02:22:53,927
This monkey can scream.

1055
02:22:53,927 --> 02:22:58,221
It screams like it in a horror movie.

1056
02:23:04,928 --> 02:23:09,420
But there are those who are good with animals.

1057
02:23:11,027 --> 02:23:15,219
Who have a way with animals.

1058
02:24:14,927 --> 02:24:17,619
It's ok..
You dying is all

1059
02:24:48,226 --> 02:24:51,419
I'll show you the light now...

1060
02:24:55,626 --> 02:24:59,019
It burns bright, for heaven.

1061
02:25:03,626 --> 02:25:07,018
No more blue tomorrows.

1062
02:25:14,026 --> 02:25:17,118
You goin high now love.

1063
02:26:40,924 --> 02:26:42,924
And...

1064
02:26:43,825 --> 02:26:45,825
And.. Print it!

1065
02:26:49,824 --> 02:26:51,424
It was fantastic.

1066
02:26:51,524 --> 02:26:55,917
Check the gate.
check the gate please!

1067
02:27:14,824 --> 02:27:17,824
Lets go right now for Nikki Grace.

1068
02:27:18,324 --> 02:27:19,824
Nikki Grace, everybody.

1069
02:27:19,924 --> 02:27:21,924
Bravo!

1070
02:28:10,823 --> 02:28:12,823
What's a matter with Nikki.

1071
02:28:38,923 --> 02:28:40,923
Nikki.

1072
02:28:40,923 --> 02:28:42,923
Nikki.

1073
02:28:50,023 --> 02:28:51,623
Nikki.

1074
02:28:51,723 --> 02:28:54,113
You were wonderful.

1075
02:30:42,820 --> 02:30:46,314
I guess after my son died,

1076
02:30:46,621 --> 02:30:50,813
, I went into a bad time.

1077
02:30:51,920 --> 02:30:57,221
When I was watching everything go around me
while I was standing in the middle.

1078
02:30:57,321 --> 02:31:02,011
Watching it, like in a dark theater.

1079
02:31:03,621 --> 02:31:07,513
before they bring the lights up.

1080
02:31:18,020 --> 02:31:19,220
Hello?

1081
02:31:19,320 --> 02:31:21,320
Yeah

1082
02:31:21,321 --> 02:31:23,321
She's still here

1083
02:31:24,820 --> 02:31:26,820
Yeah...

1084
02:31:27,920 --> 02:31:29,520
He's around here someplace.

1085
02:31:29,620 --> 02:31:31,620
That is right.

1086
02:42:30,510 --> 02:42:32,802
Heather?

1087
02:42:35,710 --> 02:42:37,710
Paul?

1088
02:46:18,007 --> 02:46:20,699
Sweet...
