1
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,939
(Woman) Hey, Rose.

2
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,357
Hey, Dorothy.

3
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,756
(Shuffling)

4
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,682
(Thump and groan)

5
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,320
I'm gonna go over there.

6
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:34,333
We're waitin'.

7
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,423
(Birds)

8
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,772
Alvin.

9
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,274
Alvin Straight!

10
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:04,279
Rose left a couple of hours ago.

11
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,201
Did you hear me hollerin' for
Rose? I wasn't lookin' for Rose.

12
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:13,872
- I haven't seen Alvin today.
- Did I ask?

13
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,707
Straight, you're late!

14
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,131
(Mutters)

15
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:41,358
Alvin!

16
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,736
- Come in, Bud.
- What the... Alvin?!

17
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,987
(Door creaks)

18
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,323
Where the hell are you?

19
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:51,076
I can't see a thing.

20
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,579
Over here, Bud. Watch your step.

21
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,706
What the hell's going on?

22
00:06:56,707 --> 00:07:00,919
What are you doin'
layin' on the floor? You nuts?

23
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,714
Supposed to be down
at Davmar's one hour ago.

24
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,299
What's going on?

25
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,052
Oh, my God!

26
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,637
(Alvin) Hey, Dorothy.

27
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:13,473
What's the number for 911?

28
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:16,393
- No, Dorothy.
- What you doin'?

29
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:20,564
I'll call the bar
and tell 'em we're not comin'.

30
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:24,443
Are you crazy?
We have a stricken man here.

31
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,070
Are you stricken, Alvin?

32
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:30,240
Put the phone down!

33
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,325
Dad, what's all the yellin'?

34
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,748
Wh-what... uh,
have you done to my dad?

35
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,750
Oh, for cry eye!

36
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,836
Dad?

37
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,880
Are you OK, Dad?

38
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:48,425
I just need a little help
gettin' up, honey.

39
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,555
(Car rattles)

40
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,978
(Engine revs severely)

41
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,857
(Bumps)

42
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,291
I'm goin' to Davmar's.
I'll be right back.

43
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,501
OK, Bud.

44
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,721
I'm not goin'.

45
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,306
Dad.

46
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,557
I'm not goin'.

47
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,768
You promised me, Dad.

48
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:59,746
OK, Mr Straight,
put this robe on.

49
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,165
Just bring me the doctor.

50
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,672
(Door opens and closes)

51
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,111
(Rose stammers) You like birds.

52
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:38,493
I build... uh, birdhouses...
uh, for bluebirds.

53
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:41,204
Oh, that's nice.

54
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:45,250
Yeah, it's Pete... uh,
Pete sells my...

55
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,628
uh, birdhouses...
at the Ace Hardware.

56
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:52,424
- I'll look for them next time.
- Yeah?

57
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,759
No operation.

58
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,472
This morning you fall and can't
get up, that's your hips, Alvin.

59
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,808
And you'll need a walker now.

60
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,268
No walker.

61
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,271
Fine, a second cane, then.

62
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,607
You say you're having
trouble seeing.

63
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,318
That could be
a diabetes-related problem.

64
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,737
I'd like to run some tests.

65
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,990
No tests and no X-rays.

66
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:21,995
Well, I see and hear
that you smoke.

67
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:25,915
My guess is you're in the early
stages of emphysema.

68
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,710
And Alvin,
you have circulation problems

69
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,796
and I'm worried
about your diet.

70
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,717
If you don't
make some changes quickly,

71
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,178
there will be
some serious consequences.

72
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,314
It... has a... a red roof.

73
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:34,109
Another pretty one, Rose.

74
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,487
I want to... uh,
paint the... uh, next one blue.

75
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,114
That's a good idea.

76
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,333
What... uh, did the doctor say?

77
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:57,173
He said
I was gonna live to be 100.

78
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:36,421
I think I'll go
and mow the lawn.

79
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,674
Uh, I can... uh,
cut it for you, Dad.

80
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,301
I got it, sweetheart.

81
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,604
(Tries ignition again)

82
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,922
God darn!

83
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,111
No, we'll...
we won't be mowin' today.

84
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,990
Storm's comin' in.

85
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,785
Yeah.

86
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,411
(Thunderclap)

87
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,547
I love a lightnin' storm.

88
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,215
Uh, me too, Dad.

89
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,094
(Phone)

90
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,531
(Rose) Hello?

91
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,660
This is... is Rose.

92
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:35,123
Yeah... Yeah... Uh-huh.

93
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,917
Oh, no...

94
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,587
When?

95
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:45,133
OK... right... right...

96
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,093
I'll tell him.

97
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:50,513
Yeah... OK... Bye.

98
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,191
Uh, that was... Bobby.

99
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,738
Uncle Lyle... had a...

100
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,072
...a stroke.

101
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,074
(Severe thunderclap)

102
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,457
Dad?

103
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,903
No, Bobby,
he... he didn't say much.

104
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,196
Uh, they've both...

105
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,489
uh, been so...

106
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,907
uh, stubborn.

107
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,411
No, no,
it was longer, I remember.

108
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:59,749
It was... uh, July, uh, 7th,
19... 88, uh, Bobby.

109
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,045
I always... remember the dates.

110
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,257
Yeah.

111
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,514
I don't know... uh,
what he'll do.

112
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,622
(Alvin) Rose, darlin'?

113
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,169
Rose?

114
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,589
I'm gonna go back on the road.

115
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,632
I've gotta go see Lyle.

116
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:35,928
But, Dad...

117
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,891
How are you?

118
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:46,022
Well, I... haven't quite
got that figured yet.

119
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:05,208
One, your eyes are bad.

120
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:08,294
That's why you don't...
uh, drive your car.

121
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:12,340
Uh, two, Uncle Lyle...
uh, lives in... uh, Wisconsin,

122
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:16,010
which is... uh, 317 miles away.

123
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:20,223
You would have to... uh,
stay all night... in Des Moines.

124
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:24,310
Then there's no...
uh, bus... to Zion.

125
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,814
Three, your... uh, hips are bad.

126
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,191
You can hardly... uh, stand...

127
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:34,237
for two minutes... And
when you... uh, do stand up...

128
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:37,865
this... is the sound you make...

129
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,785
when you... stand.

130
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,870
(Moans)

131
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:53,214
Uh, four, uh,
you are... uh, 73 years old...

132
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,882
You were... uh, born

133
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:59,887
when, uh, Calvin... uh, Coolidge
was president... of America.

134
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:06,185
Uh, you are...
uh, 73 years old, Dad.

135
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,771
And... I cannot drive you there.

136
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,859
Rose, darlin', I'm not dead yet.

137
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,783
Uh, what are we...
uh, building, Dad?

138
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,871
Havin' a party?

139
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,998
Oh, jeez...
I love... uh, parties.

140
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,960
Oh, me too.

141
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,753
And so... where's it at?

142
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,297
Where's what at?

143
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,425
Your... uh, party.

144
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:42,054
I'm not havin' a party.

145
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:45,266
I thought
YOU were havin' a party.

146
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,851
I am?

147
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:50,188
Well, yeah.
Look at all that Braunschweiger.

148
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,024
Oh, yeah,
it's a lot of Braunschweiger.

149
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:56,068
It's... uh, for my dad,
uh, for his... his trip.

150
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,779
Uh, my dad...
he's going to... uh, Wisconsin.

151
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,491
I... asked him how
he's... uh, going to get there...

152
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:05,286
Uh... but he...
uh, won't say nothing.

153
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:09,457
Wisconsin?
That is a real party state.

154
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,875
Yeah.

155
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:15,588
I... uh, hate...
uh, Braun... uh... schweiger.

156
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,218
Yeah.

157
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:49,372
Alvin, you've got three
five-gallon cans there.

158
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,210
15 gallons of gas.

159
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:57,755
What do you need
so much gas for, Alvin?

160
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:01,342
Sig, you're one nosey
son of a gun.

161
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:04,095
(Man sniggers)
You got that right.

162
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,765
- I wanna buy that.
- What?

163
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,308
The grabber.

164
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,608
Oh, jeez, Alvin.

165
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:21,279
- That's MY grabber, Alvin.
- Well?

166
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:30,579
Oh, jeez, Alvin. I don't...
I... I do have two of them...

167
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,166
I think five dollars is right.

168
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:38,713
That's a darn good grabber,
Alvin.

169
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,423
- I... I...
- Well?

170
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,925
They're hard to come by, Alvin.

171
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:47,805
It's gonna take me two months
to get another one on order.

172
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:59,400
Jeez, Alvin, ten dollars.

173
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,152
Ring her up.

174
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,881
(Sighs)

175
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:40,066
What do you need
that grabber for, Alvin?

176
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,276
Grabbin'.

177
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,269
(Motor starts)

178
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:41,710
Oh, jeez, Dad.

179
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,090
(Rumbling)

180
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,313
Listen to that
old grain elevator.

181
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,861
It's... uh, harvest time.

182
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:21,917
Uh, that... uh, trailer is too
h-heavy for... for that.

183
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:25,296
It's a lawn mower.
You're going to...

184
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:29,008
...drive a... a lawn mower
to another state?

185
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:36,974
Rosie, I've...
I've gotta go see Lyle.

186
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:42,771
And I... I've gotta make
this trip on my own.

187
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:45,483
I know you understand.

188
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,573
I guess so.

189
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,962
Look up at the sky, Rosie.

190
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:23,145
The sky is sure full
of stars tonight.

191
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:48,128
Crimenetto, it's Alvin
and he's driving his lawn mower.

192
00:25:56,346 --> 00:26:00,766
Alvin! What are you settin' out
to do here?

193
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,351
For cry eye, Alvin!

194
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:05,813
Alvin, you're gonna get blown
right off the road,

195
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,398
that's what I'm afraid!

196
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:20,494
He'll never make it
past The Grotto.

197
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,044
(Truck horn)

198
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,473
(Crickets)

199
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,251
(Ignition turns over)

200
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,714
(Turns over a second time)

201
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,928
(Turns over again and dies)

202
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,856
(Vehicle approaching)

203
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,464
I'm havin'
a little engine trouble.

204
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:27,759
What the heck is that
you're driving there?

205
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,723
It's a Rehds. Could you
give me a lift into town?

206
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:37,519
Yeah, to The Grotto. This
is the Sun Ray Tour. Get in.

207
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:42,065
- I'll get you help there.
- I'd appreciate that.

208
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,528
(Chattering from bus)

209
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,171
My Edward loved
his riding mower.

210
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,415
Hey, come here, hurry. Hurry up.

211
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:57,140
Poor Alvin.

212
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:11,071
So the man... in a... pick-up,
he brought my dad back.

213
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:15,409
Ohh... mm, I must've been
at the beauty shop.

214
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,330
What kinda pick-up?

215
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,179
(Door creaks)

216
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,143
A Ford.

217
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:46,231
But what's your dad doin'
with that gun?

218
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,983
I don't know.

219
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,696
(Fires)

220
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,532
(Fires again)

221
00:33:56,951 --> 00:34:00,412
I gave you that old Rehds
last time, right?

222
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,122
That you did.

223
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:07,127
- You tradin' in that Rehds now?
- No, I don't believe I will.

224
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:12,466
Pete told me you used that rider
in a real interestin' way.

225
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:16,344
- You still plannin' to do that?
- Yeah, Tom.

226
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:21,349
I know not to talk you out of
somethin' you set your mind to,

227
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:25,479
but Alvin, you've always
struck me as smart.

228
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,564
Well, that's appreciated.

229
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,274
Until now.

230
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,484
(Both laugh)

231
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,824
(Alvin) What year?

232
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:39,159
(Salesman) '66.

233
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,454
Kohler engine.
We've used it for parts

234
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:45,916
but I always replace them.
The guts are good.

235
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:49,836
It's got the old transmission.
Nothing fancy.

236
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:53,298
- Is it a good machine?
- It's good.

237
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:56,802
Tom, I got $325.

238
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,470
That's a fact.

239
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:02,933
Sounds good to me, Alvin.
Let's go settle up with Alice.

240
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:06,061
One more thing,
sometime you can find out

241
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:09,940
about these old machines,
if you know who run 'em.

242
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:14,277
- Do you know who owned it?
- You bet... Me.

243
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,487
All right.

244
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:05,138
(Fire roaring
and crickets rattling)

245
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:40,966
(Honks horn)

246
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,133
(Crickets)

247
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,888
(Fire crackling)

248
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:48,408
I couldn't get a ride.

249
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,166
Are you hungry?

250
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,336
Whaddaya got?

251
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,004
Weeners.

252
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,091
Weeners?

253
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,927
Weeners. Wanna try one?

254
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,615
Here's a good stick for you.

255
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,696
What a hunk ofjunk.

256
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:11,241
Eat your dinner, missy.

257
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:09,841
So... how long you been
out on the road?

258
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:14,512
Well, I been travellin'
most of my life.

259
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,764
Where you from?

260
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:19,476
Laurens.

261
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:26,107
Got a wife back there? Kids?

262
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:32,822
My wife, Francis delivered
14 babies. Seven of 'em made it.

263
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,242
My daughter,
Rose lives with me.

264
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,248
Francis died in '81.

265
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,509
Where's your family?

266
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,932
Are you runnin' away?

267
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,393
(Sighs softly)

268
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,401
How far along are ya?

269
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,866
Five months.

270
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:22,247
(Owl hoots)

271
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,634
Well, I'm headin'
to see my brother Lyle.

272
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:39,180
Huh?

273
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:43,977
I said I'm goin' to see
my brother Lyle in Mount Zion.

274
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:48,690
- Where's that?
- Wisconsin.

275
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:52,068
- Oh...
- Just across the state line.

276
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,319
Cheddar Heads.

277
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,571
(Both chuckle)

278
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,614
Aren't those the dumbest things

279
00:42:56,615 --> 00:43:00,076
you ever seen somebody
stick on their head?

280
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:04,205
I hear that's
a real party place - Wisconsin.

281
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:12,046
Guess I'll never
get to find out.

282
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:22,098
There's a blanket
in the trailer.

283
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,976
Why don't you go get it?

284
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,733
My family hates me.

285
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:21,824
They'll really hate me
when they find out.

286
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,205
You didn't tell 'em?

287
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:30,500
No. No one knows.
Not even my boyfriend.

288
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:43,054
Well, they may be mad,

289
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:47,433
but I don't think they're
mad enough to wanna lose you

290
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:50,311
or your little problem.

291
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:52,563
I don't know about that.

292
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:57,568
Well, of course, neither do I,
but a warm bed and a roof

293
00:44:57,736 --> 00:45:02,448
sounds a might better
than eatin' a hot dog on a stick

294
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:06,202
with an old geezer that's
travellin' on a lawn mower.

295
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:17,630
My daughter Rose is...

296
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:22,051
Some people call her
a little bit slow but she's not.

297
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:26,806
She's got a mind
like a bear trap for facts.

298
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:33,479
She keeps everything
organised around the house.

299
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,023
She was a real good mom.

300
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:39,026
She had four kids.

301
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:44,031
One night, somebody else
was watchin' the kids

302
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:47,869
and there was a fire.

303
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:52,165
Her second boy
got burned real bad.

304
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:55,710
Rose had nothin'
to do with it but, ah...

305
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:59,672
...on account of the way Rose is,
the State figured

306
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:03,176
she wasn't competent
to take care of them kids

307
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:06,512
and they took 'em all
away from her.

308
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:11,851
There isn't a day goes by that
she don't pine for them kids.

309
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,116
(Fire crackling)

310
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:34,874
When my kids were real little,
I used to play a game with 'em.

311
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:39,337
I'd give each one
of 'em a stick and -

312
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:44,133
one for each one of 'em -
then I'd say "you break that."

313
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,677
'Course they could, real easy.

314
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:51,682
Then I'd say "tie them sticks in
a bundle and try to break that".

315
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:57,396
'Course they couldn't.
Then I'd say "that bundle...

316
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,899
...that's family."

317
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:19,335
Why don't you sleep
in the trailer?

318
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:23,923
This chair's just fine
for me tonight.

319
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:28,052
No, I'll be fine
sleepin' out here.

320
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:31,347
Lookin' at the stars
helps me think.

321
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:34,976
Well...

322
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,871
Thank you.

323
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,016
(Birds)

324
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:23,960
(Hum of lawn mower)

325
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,042
(Distant thunder)

326
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,549
(Big thunderclap)

327
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:54,091
Woo!

328
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,065
What the?

329
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:20,196
What the hell?

330
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:52,144
Hey, how're you doin'?

331
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:53,395
Doin' good.

332
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,257
(Hum of lawn mower)

333
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:21,423
(Cheers and applause)

334
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:39,108
Hey, Irene.

335
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:43,654
You don't think about
gettin' old when you're young.

336
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:45,281
You shouldn't.

337
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:57,459
Must be something good
about gettin' old.

338
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:02,464
Well, I can't imagine anything
good about being blind and lame

339
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:06,260
at the same time, but... still

340
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:11,265
at my age, I've seen about all
that life has to dish out.

341
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:15,227
I know to separate the wheat

342
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:20,316
from the chaff and let
the small stuff fall away.

343
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:25,362
Let's go, man. 

344
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:31,535
So, ah... what's the worst part
about being old, Alvin?

345
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:39,543
The worst part of being old is
rememberin' when you was young.

346
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:47,926
(Hum of lawn mower)

347
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:56,060
(Roar of big engines)

348
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,772
(Hum of lawn mower)

349
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:59,123
(Car horn)  

350
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:00,541
(Car skids)  

351
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:01,959
(Crash)  

352
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,007
(Motor dies)

353
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:11,552
(Wind whistles)

354
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:41,498
Can I help you, lady?

355
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:45,794
No, you can't help me.
No one can help me.

356
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:50,257
I've tried driving with my
lights on, sounding my horn!

357
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:55,262
I scream, I roll the window down
and bang on the door

358
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:58,557
and play Public Enemy real loud!

359
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:02,519
I've prayed to St Francis
of Assisi, St Christopher too!

360
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:06,565
What the heck! I've tried
everything and still every week

361
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:08,984
I hit at least one deer!

362
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:13,989
I have hit 13 deer in seven
weeks driving down this road!

363
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:20,245
And I HAVE to drive
down this road every day,

364
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:23,248
40 miles to work and back.

365
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:29,421
I HAVE to drive to work
and I HAVE to drive home!

366
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,552
Where do they come from?

367
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,483
Oh... he's dead.

368
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:56,406
And I LOVE deer.

369
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,291
(Car screams away)

370
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:13,335
Well, they sure picked the right
place to practise a burn on.

371
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:16,838
(Hums "Taps")

372
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:30,894
(Man) That Rumelthanger place
was an eyesore.

373
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:51,832
(Motor clicks)

374
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:55,252
(Chugging)

375
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:01,258
(Bigger click)

376
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:18,233
What do you suppose?

377
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:20,444
(Woman) Is that a lawn mower?

378
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:24,406
(Thundering motor)

379
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:51,850
(Breathes deeply)

380
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:53,894
(Man) Mister, you OK?

381
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:04,863
Jeez, mister, you're lucky
she didn't roll on you.

382
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:14,414
I guess the belt broke.

383
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:16,750
(Man) I wouldn't be surprised.

384
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:20,086
You don't have brakes
on that trailer, right?

385
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:23,173
I worked for John Deere
for 30 years,

386
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:27,093
you shouldn't be hauling a rig
behind a mower.

387
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:30,222
At least not down
a hill like that.

388
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:33,058
I'm Danny Riordan.

389
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:35,811
Alvin Straight.

390
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:40,398
Alvin, let's get you
and this rig off the road

391
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:43,276
and see what the damage is.

392
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:58,166
Let's get this off the road.

393
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:01,920
Sure you're OK?

394
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:31,825
(Birds)

395
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:41,251
OK.

396
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:45,672
You OK? Everything all right?
I'm going back to the exercise.

397
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:47,841
Thanks. Appreciate it.

398
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:54,014
(Sighs)

399
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:57,392
Well... let's
take a look at this mower.

400
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:03,273
- This is what '65, '66?
- '66.

401
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:12,616
Well... tell you right now,
Alvin,

402
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:15,160
you won't be going
anywhere tonight.

403
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:18,371
Aside from your, ah,
drive belt being busted,

404
01:05:18,372 --> 01:05:20,957
you got transmission problems.

405
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:24,336
- Where you headed?
- Mount Zion.

406
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:27,464
Mount Zion, Wisconsin?
Past Prairie du Chien?

407
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,925
That's 60 more miles of hills.

408
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:31,843
That's across the Mississippi.

409
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:34,304
(Danny)
What's in Mount Zion, Alvin?

410
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:36,097
My brother lives there.

411
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:40,518
- Why didn't you take your car?
- I'm not licensed.

412
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:44,731
- (Woman) Couldn't he visit?
- He's had a bad stroke.

413
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:48,026
Where are you coming from?

414
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:49,903
Back a piece.

415
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:52,280
(Danny) West Union?

416
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:54,115
- Hawkeye?
- Nope.

417
01:05:55,868 --> 01:06:00,080
Well, not New Hampton?
You haven't come that far.

418
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:03,333
You've come a long ways,
haven't you?

419
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:06,503
Yeah, I have. Laurens, Iowa.

420
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:08,213
(Woman) Laurens?!

421
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:13,218
That's west of The Grotto. How
long have you been on the road?

422
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:14,719
What's the date?

423
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,137
October eighth.

424
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:24,729
Five weeks. I left Laurens
on the fifth of September.

425
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:28,191
You been bunkin' in that?

426
01:06:28,192 --> 01:06:31,069
That's my rollin' home.

427
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:33,238
Where you been settin' up camp?

428
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:37,909
In the fields. I pull off.
I don't travel at night.

429
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:40,370
Haven't you been scared,
being alone?

430
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:42,372
There are weird people
everywhere.

431
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:47,377
Well, ma'am, I fought
in the trenches in World War II.

432
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:51,506
Why should I be scared
of an Iowa cornfield?

433
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:54,801
Well, um...

434
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:57,137
till we get
this mower fixed...

435
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:02,475
why don't you... ah,
bivouac in our yard here?

436
01:07:02,476 --> 01:07:05,937
There's a bathroom
in the garage you can use.

437
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:08,523
Well, that's
awful generous of you

438
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:12,944
and I'm sure my machine here
is agreeable to that too.

439
01:07:15,781 --> 01:07:19,617
Sure wanna thank you folks
for helping me today.

440
01:07:19,618 --> 01:07:22,120
There's a lot of rain forecast.

441
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:25,790
Sure don't want to get stuck
in that trailer.

442
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:30,420
I... I do a little woodwork.
I thought you'd like a few fish.

443
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:33,548
My daughter does woodwork.
She makes birdhouses.

444
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:35,175
(Both) Oh, that's nice.

445
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:45,435
- You finished there?
- I believe I am.

446
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:29,896
(Fly buzzing)

447
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:18,862
- I'm in need of a phone.
- Sure. Come in.

448
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:22,824
I wanna tell my daughter
about my recent travels.

449
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:24,492
Sure. Come in.

450
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:29,497
If it's all the same with you,
do you have a cordless phone?

451
01:09:29,748 --> 01:09:34,544
- Door's wide open, come...
- I can call from out here.

452
01:09:43,721 --> 01:09:48,099
Here you go. You're welcome
to sit in the kitchen.

453
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:51,561
We can leave, if you're
lookin' for privacy.

454
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:56,399
Out here's fine.
Is the area code still 712 here?

455
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:59,652
No, Alvin.
That hill rolled you into 319.

456
01:09:59,653 --> 01:10:03,364
You need to dial one
and your area code.

457
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:04,782
712, thank you.

458
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:22,217
'Hello? '

459
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:23,509
Rose?

460
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:24,928
Dad? Dad...

461
01:10:27,848 --> 01:10:30,225
Uh, I'm... so glad to hear you.

462
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:41,736
It's gonna cost him a bundle
to fix that mower.

463
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:45,448
I don't think
he's got that kinda money.

464
01:10:45,449 --> 01:10:48,368
I wouldn't drive
that thing to Excelsior.

465
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:51,204
It's a lawn mower,
for God's sake.

466
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:56,042
Uh, your social security cheque?
Ah... it's here, Dad.

467
01:10:56,043 --> 01:10:58,920
Rose, can you send me my cheque?

468
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:01,172
Uh, yeah.

469
01:11:01,173 --> 01:11:04,884
He's damn lucky
he made it down that hill.

470
01:11:04,885 --> 01:11:08,429
- He could've died easily.
- Yeah.

471
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:10,473
He's none too strong.

472
01:11:10,474 --> 01:11:14,143
See how he has to walk
with the canes?

473
01:11:14,144 --> 01:11:16,354
OK, Dad.

474
01:11:17,648 --> 01:11:18,856
(Chuckles)

475
01:11:21,193 --> 01:11:23,611
I... I...

476
01:11:26,156 --> 01:11:30,952
OK, OK, Dad, OK.
I... I have a pencil, Dad.

477
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:33,746
The hills just get worse

478
01:11:33,747 --> 01:11:36,624
the closer you get
to the Mississippi.

479
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:41,462
Go ahead and drive him, honey.

480
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:45,216
Mount Zion can't
be half a day. It's fine.

481
01:11:45,217 --> 01:11:48,469
You're a good man,
Danny Riordan.

482
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:53,016
And that's why I married you,
despite what my mother said.

483
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:56,311
Now, shoo!

484
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:57,562
Dad?

485
01:11:57,563 --> 01:11:59,355
I miss you, Dad.

486
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:02,442
I love you, Rosie.

487
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:04,527
'I love you too, Dad.'

488
01:12:04,528 --> 01:12:06,195
Uh, bye, Dad.

489
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:09,615
Bye... Dad.

490
01:12:09,616 --> 01:12:10,825
(Tone)

491
01:12:12,911 --> 01:12:14,162
Ahem.

492
01:12:36,143 --> 01:12:37,560
(Door creaks)

493
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:41,522
(Footsteps)

494
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:45,151
What are you cookin'
there, Alvin?

495
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:47,695
Oh, I'm makin'
my Mexican coffee.

496
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:50,281
Ah. Mind if I join you?

497
01:12:50,282 --> 01:12:53,576
Get you a chair...
that iron one there.

498
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:59,916
You'll be a guest
in your own back yard.

499
01:13:02,419 --> 01:13:06,547
Amm, I talked to the Olsen
twins, and, ah... they estimate

500
01:13:08,967 --> 01:13:13,388
it'll cost around 250 dollars
to get your mower fixed.

501
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:16,557
Well, that's twice
what it oughta be,

502
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:19,477
I guess it's cos
they're twins, huh?

503
01:13:19,478 --> 01:13:21,145
(Both laugh)

504
01:13:21,146 --> 01:13:26,150
I'd be happy to drive you the
rest of the way to Mount Zion.

505
01:13:26,944 --> 01:13:31,364
Be a nice Sunday drive.
We enjoy crossin' the river,

506
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:34,033
especially now
with the trees in colour.

507
01:13:34,034 --> 01:13:36,702
Well, I appreciate that, but...

508
01:13:36,703 --> 01:13:39,997
...I wanna finish this one
my own way.

509
01:13:51,885 --> 01:13:53,302
Try this.

510
01:13:58,225 --> 01:13:59,434
Thank you.

511
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:04,939
Well, you know, Alvin,
there's a lotta hills

512
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:07,775
bigger than Clairmont's
between here and Zion.

513
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:10,945
Even if you get that mower
runnin' again,

514
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:13,197
it may still break down.

515
01:14:13,198 --> 01:14:17,743
Well, you're a kind man
talkin' to a stubborn man.

516
01:14:17,744 --> 01:14:21,122
I still wanna finish this
the way I started.

517
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:26,669
No, no...

518
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:29,046
Hi, Verlyn.

519
01:14:29,047 --> 01:14:32,300
- How the heck you doin'?
- Fine.

520
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:33,676
Wonderful.

521
01:14:33,677 --> 01:14:35,094
He's there.

522
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:51,277
Well... they gave you
a plate of her brownies.

523
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:53,196
(Laughs) Yeah.

524
01:14:53,197 --> 01:14:54,947
How's that for timing?

525
01:14:54,948 --> 01:14:57,033
Janet makes the best brownies...

526
01:14:57,034 --> 01:14:58,868
(Both) in Lafayette county.

527
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:02,622
She won prizes every year
at the county fair.

528
01:15:02,623 --> 01:15:05,166
- Mmm... help yourself.
- Thank you.

529
01:15:09,713 --> 01:15:13,758
Mmm... I've been doin' errands
and I'm heading for a beer.

530
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:16,552
I thought you'd like
to join me.

531
01:15:16,553 --> 01:15:18,888
Well, I don't drink
any more, but...

532
01:15:18,889 --> 01:15:22,099
I'm always up for a change
of scenery.

533
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:23,351
Well, come on.

534
01:15:31,818 --> 01:15:35,613
Well, I'm ridin' a little higher
and a little faster.

535
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:38,741
Except when you came down
that hill.

536
01:15:38,742 --> 01:15:40,576
(Both laugh)

537
01:15:47,459 --> 01:15:51,629
I picked up a mournful taste
for liquor in France.

538
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:55,466
When I came back,
I couldn't drink enough of it.

539
01:15:55,467 --> 01:16:00,596
I wasn't worth a stick
of stove wood... I was mean.

540
01:16:03,517 --> 01:16:06,435
A preacher helped me
put some distance

541
01:16:06,436 --> 01:16:10,815
between me and the bottle.
And he helped me see...

542
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:15,653
the reason I was drinkin', I was
seein' all them things here,

543
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:17,738
that I'd seen over there.

544
01:16:23,453 --> 01:16:28,457
♪ Though things may look very
dark, your dream is not... ♪

545
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:31,335
Lots of men came back
drinkin' hard.

546
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:37,383
Well... everyone
tryin' to forget.

547
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:42,263
I can see it
in a man right away.

548
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:47,268
Yup.

549
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:49,312
♪ The rainbow,
you will suddenly... ♪

550
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:06,203
There was one time...

551
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:10,166
when we just...

552
01:17:12,002 --> 01:17:16,422
Were waiting for
the first warm meal in ten days.

553
01:17:23,513 --> 01:17:25,848
We... thought
we'd seen the worst.

554
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:32,104
We hadn't had
much trouble from the air.

555
01:17:35,567 --> 01:17:37,943
I was on the rise...

556
01:17:37,944 --> 01:17:39,945
with the quartermaster,

557
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:45,076
workin' on more coffee
for me and my buddies.

558
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:50,373
(Sobbing) A stray Fokker
came over the treetops...

559
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:55,461
and dropped
an incendiary on the mess tent.

560
01:17:55,462 --> 01:17:56,962
(Sounds of war)

561
01:17:56,963 --> 01:17:58,589
All my buddies...

562
01:18:00,467 --> 01:18:05,012
The Kraut banked right in front
of me on that hill...

563
01:18:06,973 --> 01:18:10,059
and now I can...
see the... Swastika.

564
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:27,618
That is one thing
that I can't shake loose...

565
01:18:27,619 --> 01:18:30,705
All my buddies faces
are still young.

566
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:38,546
And the thing is, the more years
I have, the more they've lost.

567
01:18:39,297 --> 01:18:40,798
(Sobbing quietly)

568
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:44,468
And it's not always buddies
faces that I see,

569
01:18:44,469 --> 01:18:46,429
sometime they're German faces.

570
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:53,978
Near the end we were shootin'
moon-faced boys.

571
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:02,153
I was a sniper.

572
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:06,991
Where I grew up, you learned
how to shoot to hunt food.

573
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:12,329
They'd post me up front.
Darn near ahead of the lines.

574
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,834
And I'd sit... forever.

575
01:19:18,628 --> 01:19:23,048
It's an amazing thing what you
can see while you're sittin'.

576
01:19:23,049 --> 01:19:29,263
I'd look for the officers, the
radio guys or artillery spotter.

577
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:35,561
Sometime I'd spot
a gun nest by the smoke

578
01:19:37,355 --> 01:19:40,191
and I'd fire into it.

579
01:19:40,192 --> 01:19:43,986
Sometime it was just
a movement in the woods.

580
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:51,702
We had a scout,

581
01:19:53,205 --> 01:19:54,413
a little fella...

582
01:19:55,874 --> 01:19:57,082
name of Kotz.

583
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:02,421
He was a Polish boy
from Milwaukee.

584
01:20:05,634 --> 01:20:10,179
He'd always take recon
and he was darn good at it.

585
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:15,643
We went by his word and he saved
our skin many a time.

586
01:20:17,938 --> 01:20:20,189
He was a little fella...

587
01:20:26,696 --> 01:20:29,156
We'd broken
out of the hedgerows...

588
01:20:30,784 --> 01:20:33,911
We were makin'
a run across the open

589
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:37,456
and we come upon a woods.

590
01:20:39,543 --> 01:20:41,335
We started drawin' fire.

591
01:20:43,421 --> 01:20:45,422
I took my usual position...

592
01:20:47,175 --> 01:20:51,011
and I saw somethin' movin',
real slow like.

593
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:58,602
I waited ten minutes,
it moved again and I shot.

594
01:21:00,146 --> 01:21:01,981
The movement stopped.

595
01:21:04,150 --> 01:21:08,821
The next day
we found Kotz... head shot.

596
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:14,243
He'd been workin'
his way back toward our lines.

597
01:21:16,246 --> 01:21:20,916
Everyone in the unit thought
a German sniper had taken him...

598
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:25,838
Everyone, all these years.

599
01:21:28,341 --> 01:21:29,967
Everyone but me.

600
01:22:27,233 --> 01:22:28,442
Ha ha!

601
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:31,236
See, Harald... brainiac...

602
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:38,202
Got the mower assembly free with
this here little old wrench...

603
01:22:38,203 --> 01:22:40,120
You said it wouldn't work.

604
01:22:40,121 --> 01:22:43,582
I'd say it worked
pretty good. Wouldn't you?

605
01:22:47,379 --> 01:22:51,924
So help me slide her out.
We can get settled up.

606
01:23:17,033 --> 01:23:18,701
(Harald snarls)

607
01:23:18,702 --> 01:23:24,123
Uh... I got parts and labour
that add up to $247.80.

608
01:23:29,045 --> 01:23:33,549
Well, I'd say that's a little
heavy for light work.

609
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:35,551
Don't you think?

610
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:38,887
I've got an old man's eyes,
but, ah...

611
01:23:38,888 --> 01:23:41,890
I'm noticin' some new tyre here.

612
01:23:41,891 --> 01:23:45,436
Well, now... ah,
we got those off a resell,

613
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:47,479
but the treads are good!

614
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:52,234
Well, friend, are you chargin'
me for good or for new?

615
01:23:52,235 --> 01:23:55,279
Ahhhh... Thorvald?

616
01:23:56,823 --> 01:24:00,159
Ahh... we can make
an adjustment there.

617
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:06,248
Well, I think the adjustment
should be about thirty dollars.

618
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:10,002
Is that what
your pencil's sayin'?

619
01:24:10,003 --> 01:24:12,046
And, ah... about the labour...

620
01:24:14,632 --> 01:24:19,553
I appreciate that you boys have
done some real time on this...

621
01:24:19,554 --> 01:24:23,974
of course, a man's gotta ask
when he's workin' with twins -

622
01:24:23,975 --> 01:24:25,809
especially a bickerin' pair -

623
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:29,438
how much workin' was fightin'?

624
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:31,482
(Danny) He got that right.

625
01:24:31,483 --> 01:24:33,192
(Both) Shut up, Danny.

626
01:24:33,193 --> 01:24:37,905
If I was to judge by this joyous
affair I saw today,

627
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:42,159
I would calculate maybe 20
per cent taken off the labour.

628
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:43,577
Anything else, mister?

629
01:24:45,789 --> 01:24:50,793
Well, I'm not from these parts,
but where I come from,

630
01:24:50,877 --> 01:24:55,672
I would say that that was a
little rich for Iowa oil.

631
01:24:55,673 --> 01:24:58,342
Take the oil, no charge.

632
01:24:58,343 --> 01:25:02,805
Well, that's a splendid offer
and I do appreciate it.

633
01:25:04,307 --> 01:25:05,682
What's the tally?

634
01:25:05,683 --> 01:25:08,018
Ah... ahhh...

635
01:25:15,485 --> 01:25:17,444
Hundred and eighty even?

636
01:25:17,445 --> 01:25:19,822
Done. (Chuckles)

637
01:25:19,823 --> 01:25:24,827
Thanks to you boys, I'm gonna
get this rig back on the road.

638
01:25:25,453 --> 01:25:30,457
I've drove it all the way across
Iowa and I'm hopin' it holds on

639
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:34,628
till I get to Wisconsin.
My brother lives there.

640
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:37,756
I haven't seen him
in ten years.

641
01:25:37,757 --> 01:25:40,551
There's no one
knows your life better

642
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:43,345
than a brother
that's near your age.

643
01:25:43,346 --> 01:25:46,098
He knows who and what you are

644
01:25:46,099 --> 01:25:49,351
better than anyone on Earth.

645
01:25:49,352 --> 01:25:53,856
My brother and I said some...
unforgivable things

646
01:25:53,857 --> 01:25:59,236
the last time we met, but, I'm
tryin' to put that behind me.

647
01:26:01,447 --> 01:26:05,159
And this trip is a hard
swallow... of my pride,

648
01:26:07,579 --> 01:26:10,289
I just hope I'm not too late.

649
01:26:19,048 --> 01:26:21,592
A brother's a brother.

650
01:26:32,979 --> 01:26:34,188
Well...

651
01:26:35,982 --> 01:26:38,483
Guess I'll be turnin' in.

652
01:26:38,484 --> 01:26:43,071
I'll, ah... see you in the
morning, then, before you go.

653
01:26:43,072 --> 01:26:45,115
I'm gonna leave awful early.

654
01:27:04,969 --> 01:27:09,306
I wanna thank you for your
kindness to a stranger.

655
01:27:09,307 --> 01:27:13,435
It's been a genuine pleasure
havin' you here, Alvin.

656
01:27:13,436 --> 01:27:15,312
Write to us, sometime.

657
01:27:15,313 --> 01:27:16,521
I will.

658
01:27:27,742 --> 01:27:29,409
(Lawn mower starts up)

659
01:31:28,941 --> 01:31:30,192
(Passing truck)

660
01:32:04,727 --> 01:32:06,811
I noticed your campfire.

661
01:32:06,812 --> 01:32:11,650
I brought you some dinner...
Mashed potatoes, meat loaf.

662
01:32:11,651 --> 01:32:14,861
Well, thank you kindly.
I've had my dinner,

663
01:32:14,862 --> 01:32:18,031
but would you
join me for a while?

664
01:32:18,032 --> 01:32:19,282
Sure.

665
01:32:26,582 --> 01:32:27,791
Thank you.

666
01:32:36,217 --> 01:32:39,177
I hope you don't
mind me trespassin'.

667
01:32:39,178 --> 01:32:41,513
Oh, no, not at all.

668
01:32:41,514 --> 01:32:43,098
Made a fine choice.

669
01:32:43,099 --> 01:32:46,601
You're camped next to
one of the oldest cemeteries

670
01:32:46,602 --> 01:32:50,605
in the Midwest.
French Catholic trappers.

671
01:32:50,606 --> 01:32:54,317
- The Marquette party.
- Two of his men.

672
01:32:56,445 --> 01:32:59,322
I couldn't help but notice

673
01:32:59,323 --> 01:33:01,825
the rather unusual
mode of transport.

674
01:33:03,828 --> 01:33:07,956
Well, you're not the first
person to notice that, Padre.

675
01:33:09,709 --> 01:33:13,003
My eyes are bad. I can't drive.

676
01:33:13,004 --> 01:33:16,089
I don't like someone else
drivin' the bus,

677
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:19,092
and I need to get
to my brother's.

678
01:33:19,093 --> 01:33:20,343
Fair enough.

679
01:33:20,344 --> 01:33:22,053
Where is he?

680
01:33:22,054 --> 01:33:25,849
Well, he's so close,
I can practically feel him.

681
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:27,267
Mount Zion.

682
01:33:27,268 --> 01:33:28,935
What's his name?

683
01:33:28,936 --> 01:33:31,771
Lyle Straight.

684
01:33:31,772 --> 01:33:36,776
Is he that fella that came in
with a stroke some weeks ago?

685
01:33:38,946 --> 01:33:40,572
Do you know him?

686
01:33:40,573 --> 01:33:43,700
I work at the hospital
in Boscobel.

687
01:33:43,701 --> 01:33:45,785
I remember him comin' in.

688
01:33:45,786 --> 01:33:49,039
Caught my attention
because... he lives in my parish.

689
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:50,582
Well, he's a Baptist.

690
01:33:50,583 --> 01:33:53,460
Oh, I believe he told me that.

691
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:58,131
Told me a few things,
matter of fact,

692
01:33:58,132 --> 01:34:01,051
but he didn't
mention having a brother.

693
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:07,724
Well, neither one of us has had
a brother for quite some time.

694
01:34:11,771 --> 01:34:15,231
So, you saw him?
Is he all right?

695
01:34:15,232 --> 01:34:20,612
I only saw him that once and
I haven't heard anything more.

696
01:34:33,334 --> 01:34:38,338
Well, Lyle and I grew up
as close as brothers could be.

697
01:34:38,756 --> 01:34:43,468
We were raised on a farm
in Moorhead, Minnesota.

698
01:34:43,469 --> 01:34:48,473
We worked hard. My mom and dad
darn near killed themselves

699
01:34:48,933 --> 01:34:52,185
tryin' to make that farm work.

700
01:34:52,186 --> 01:34:56,731
And me and Lyle would
make games out of our chores.

701
01:34:58,442 --> 01:35:02,487
We'd dream up somethin'
about racin' and wagerin'

702
01:35:02,488 --> 01:35:06,366
do anything to keep
our mind off the cold.

703
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:07,992
Lord, it was cold.

704
01:35:07,993 --> 01:35:12,789
He and I used
to sleep out in the yard

705
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:16,000
every summer night,
if it wasn't pourin'.

706
01:35:16,001 --> 01:35:20,422
Nine months of winter,
we couldn't get enough summer.

707
01:35:20,423 --> 01:35:23,758
We'd bunk down
when the sun went down.

708
01:35:23,759 --> 01:35:28,513
We'd talk to each other
until we went to sleep.

709
01:35:28,514 --> 01:35:33,017
We'd talk about the stars
and whether there might be

710
01:35:34,311 --> 01:35:38,231
somebody else like us
out in space,

711
01:35:38,232 --> 01:35:41,317
places we wanted to go and...

712
01:35:41,318 --> 01:35:44,237
it made
our trials seem smaller.

713
01:35:46,323 --> 01:35:50,452
Yeah, we pretty much talked
each other through growin' up.

714
01:35:55,291 --> 01:36:00,628
Oh, whatever happened
between you two?

715
01:36:01,964 --> 01:36:05,884
Story as old as the Bible.
Cain and Abel.

716
01:36:09,430 --> 01:36:10,638
Anger, vanity.

717
01:36:13,893 --> 01:36:17,562
You mix that together
with liquor, and...

718
01:36:17,563 --> 01:36:22,776
you've got two brothers who
haven't spoken in ten years.

719
01:36:24,737 --> 01:36:29,741
Well, whatever it was
that made me and Lyle so mad...

720
01:36:31,076 --> 01:36:33,286
don't matter any more.

721
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:36,122
I wanna make peace.

722
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:39,334
I wanna sit with him,

723
01:36:40,628 --> 01:36:42,462
look up at the stars...

724
01:36:43,756 --> 01:36:45,590
like we used to do...

725
01:36:46,884 --> 01:36:48,134
so long ago.

726
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:56,518
Well, sir...

727
01:36:56,602 --> 01:36:59,604
I say "Amen" to that.

728
01:37:06,445 --> 01:37:07,695
(Fire crackles)

729
01:37:19,917 --> 01:37:21,543
(Hum of lawn mower)

730
01:37:57,371 --> 01:37:58,621
Howdy.

731
01:38:15,764 --> 01:38:19,642
I haven't had a drink
in a lot of years.

732
01:38:19,643 --> 01:38:22,353
Now I'm gonna have me a beer.

733
01:38:22,354 --> 01:38:23,855
What flavour?

734
01:38:23,856 --> 01:38:26,900
What does
a Miller's Lite taste like?

735
01:38:37,995 --> 01:38:39,245
There you go.

736
01:38:44,835 --> 01:38:47,754
- How's it taste?
- It's good.

737
01:38:47,755 --> 01:38:50,590
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

738
01:38:50,591 --> 01:38:55,511
It's an interesting rig you got
outside. Get up the hill OK?

739
01:38:55,512 --> 01:38:59,807
That hill and 200 more
just like it.

740
01:38:59,808 --> 01:39:01,893
How far did ya come?

741
01:39:01,894 --> 01:39:04,145
From Iowa.

742
01:39:04,146 --> 01:39:06,522
I'm headed
for Lyle Straight's place.

743
01:39:06,523 --> 01:39:10,401
Iowa! My God,
you must be thirsty.

744
01:39:10,402 --> 01:39:11,653
(Cough)

745
01:39:13,822 --> 01:39:15,073
(Scraping)

746
01:39:24,375 --> 01:39:25,625
(Sighs)

747
01:39:50,609 --> 01:39:51,859
(Scraping)

748
01:39:56,073 --> 01:39:57,323
Another beer?

749
01:39:57,324 --> 01:39:59,283
This will do me fine.

750
01:39:59,284 --> 01:40:02,745
I wonder could you point me
to Lyle's place?

751
01:40:02,746 --> 01:40:06,290
I haven't seen him
in an awful long time.

752
01:40:06,291 --> 01:40:10,753
Well, you just... ah,
cross 61 here, on "W",

753
01:40:10,754 --> 01:40:15,758
Take "W" on down to Weed Road
and then on to Remington Road.

754
01:40:15,843 --> 01:40:19,512
(Barman) On your right
will be Lyle's place.

755
01:40:19,513 --> 01:40:22,265
If he's there that is.

756
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:28,081
(Motor clicks)

757
01:41:28,082 --> 01:41:29,499
(Chugs)

758
01:41:34,296 --> 01:41:35,546
(Squeaks)

759
01:41:39,051 --> 01:41:40,468
(Motor dies)

760
01:41:52,648 --> 01:41:53,898
(Motor hissing)

761
01:42:42,948 --> 01:42:44,198
(Turns off engine)

762
01:42:44,199 --> 01:42:45,783
How you doin'?

763
01:42:45,784 --> 01:42:47,034
Not too good.

764
01:42:51,331 --> 01:42:52,999
This thing's just tired.

765
01:42:58,755 --> 01:43:02,550
Is there anything
I can do to help you?

766
01:43:02,551 --> 01:43:06,304
Well, I don't know.
It just quit on me.

767
01:43:06,305 --> 01:43:08,890
Why don't you try her again?

768
01:43:08,891 --> 01:43:11,601
(Motor turns over and ignites)

769
01:43:11,602 --> 01:43:14,937
I'm headin'
to Lyle Straight's place.

770
01:43:14,938 --> 01:43:17,440
(Tractor engine
starts with a roar)

771
01:45:21,106 --> 01:45:22,940
Lyle!

772
01:45:27,195 --> 01:45:28,571
Lyle?

773
01:45:38,415 --> 01:45:39,832
(Lyle) Alvin?

774
01:46:20,582 --> 01:46:22,625
(Husky voice) Sit down, Alvin.

775
01:47:13,635 --> 01:47:19,014
Did you ride that thing all
the way out here to see me?

776
01:47:20,350 --> 01:47:21,767
I did, Lyle.

777
01:51:49,202 --> 01:51:52,287
