185
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:16,670
Would one still call
those, "bohemians?"

186
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:20,206
My grandfather
was Bohemian.

187
01:06:21,877 --> 01:06:23,538
You know,
in the Prague sense.

188
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:28,742
I strongly doubt that he would
have had any bloody sympathy...

189
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:30,786
...for those kinds
of bohemians.

190
01:06:32,588 --> 01:06:36,786
And then of course, they are often
the true artists, are they not?

191
01:06:38,227 --> 01:06:40,491
Are you interested
in art, by any chance?

192
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:43,594
Maybe painting,
perhaps?

193
01:06:44,867 --> 01:06:45,925
(LAUGHING) Yes.

194
01:06:47,236 --> 01:06:54,074
Well, as we were discussing,
the derivation of the usage of bohemian...

195
01:06:54,577 --> 01:06:58,035
...in reference to artists or
artistic types, wasn't that it?

196
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:05,884
I don't know
the origin, exactly.

197
01:07:07,156 --> 01:07:09,556
Of course there's Puccini's opera,
<i>"La Boh�me".</i>

198
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:12,526
That's based on the French book,
<i>"Sc�nes de la vie de boh�me."</i>

199
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:14,756
Probably published
mid-nineteenth century.

200
01:07:15,798 --> 01:07:22,362
There was an oddly
beautiful Finnish film...

201
01:07:25,007 --> 01:07:26,702
...some years ago
based on the book.

202
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:30,803
But where the use of
bohemian or <i>boh�me</i> in French,

203
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,313
came from to
begin with...

204
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:35,777
I can only speculate.

211

...that this guitar was owned and
played by Manuel el Sevillano.

212
01:08:39,215 --> 01:08:44,847
It was recorded on a wax cylinder
in the 1920's, believe it or not.
