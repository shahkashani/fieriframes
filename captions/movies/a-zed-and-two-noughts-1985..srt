DAVID ATTENBOROUGH: If the
evolutionary span of life on Earth

44
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:48,915
is represented by a year of 365 days,

45
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:55,249
then man made his first appearance
on the evening of the 31st of December,

46
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,624
just as the daylight was fading.

47
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:03,999
It had taken some 4,000 million years
for that entrance to be made.

48
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:08,290
A very slow,
uneven progress of life forms,

49
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:12,499
changing and evolving in a long,
continuous procession.

50
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:18,874
It's comparatively easy to comprehend
how one species gave way to another.

51
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:23,582
But perhaps more difficult to understand
the evolutionary leap necessary

52
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:28,040
to bridge the most sophisticated
of the apes, with man.

53
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,749
And more difficult, still,

54
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:33,082
to contemplate
how life could create itself,

55
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,249
apparently, out of nothing.

56
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:42,374
ON SPEAKER: The conditions
for the origin of life on Earth

57
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,165
can never be reproduced again.

58
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:47,665
The atmosphere is now rich in oxygen,

59
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:52,082
the necessary ingredient
for the respiratory life of all animals.

60
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:02,082
But in the beginning
there was little or no oxygen.

61
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:06,790
There was methane, ammonia,
carbon monoxide, water,

62
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:12,540
electrical storms, ultraviolet light,
the first carbon compounds.

63
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:17,790
And around volcanic springs like these,
an abundance of hydrogen.

64
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,790
These conditions were advantageous

65
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:24,749
for the formation of the first
cyanophytes or blue-green algae.

66
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,582
Their utilisation of hydrogen in water,

67
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,874
using chlorophyll
in the process of photosynthesis

68
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:34,249
liberated oxygen in abundant quantities

69
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:37,874
to change radically
the atmosphere of the Earth.

70
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,915
Their arrival marks a major step

71
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,665
towards the evolution
of higher forms of life.

because she couldn't.

77

amputated at the groin.

Some of her lovers thought,

84
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:33,499
she might liked to be buried
in a short coffin.

should be filled with flowers.

you'll find this film inaccurate.

160
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,790
Oh, don't ruin it for me, Fallast.

161
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:52,290
I'm going to take it in stages.
Needs absorbing.

162
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,499
I'm sure I must have got it wrong before

163
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,415
and I'm on the lookout for clues.

164
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,499
What sort of clues?

165
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:02,249
Gonna try and separate the true clues
and the red herrings.

166
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:08,582
I'm told, that all eight parts
of the second copy of this film

167
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:09,915
are out on loan as well.

168
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,832
OLIVER: Perhaps someone else
is also looking for red herrings.

169
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:17,582
ATTENBOROUGH:
Myriads of simply-structured organisms,

170
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:22,707
whose ancestors began to appear some,
2,000 million years ago

171
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:26,374
from among the primitive bacteria
and the first algae.

172
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:31,082
Protozoa, primitive jellyfish,

173
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:34,915
sponges, coral polyps, colonisers.

174
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:40,957
Innumerable individuals
making the first oceans a rich soup,

175
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:45,832
ripe for the further and more
sophisticated development of life forms.

176
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,915
ALBA: Oliver, entrez!

177
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:57,749
- Where is Oswald?
- OLIVER: Uh, he's just working.

178
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:02,332
Work consoles him, I think.

179
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,749
How did you first know my wife?

180
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,540
I met her at the zoo with my daughter,

181
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:16,082
when I took to Beta to the insect house
to watch butterflies.

182
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:20,290
Your wife said they should be let free.

183
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,040
She didn't approve of zoos, did she?

184
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,874
OLIVER: Why is your
daughter called Beta?

185
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:34,915
ALBA: Alpha, Beta, Gamma.
I wanted 26 children.

186
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,457
Beta wasn't the first.
The first one died.

187
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,582
I had an infection, mercury poisoning.

188
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,999
Where I come from,
you take mercury to procure an abortion.

189
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:49,124
There aren't 26 letters in the Greek
alphabet, there's only 23.

190
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:53,790
- What's Oswald Deuce doing here?
- Watching an apple fade away.

191
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,249
How original!

192
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:59,124
- "A" is for...
- Angelfish.

193
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,207
- "B" is for...
- Butterfly.

194
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,582
PLATE: Do you think that's wise?

195
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,540
There are too many of them.

196
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,124
Will they survive the cold?

197
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,249
This zoo is too crowded.

198
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,665
Bit too many staff, for a start.

199
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,790
Haven't you got anything
better to do than watch me?

200
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,124
Venus de Milo's been asking after you.

201
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:44,374
I cannot stand the idea
of her body rotting away

202
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,624
for nothing.

203
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,540
Or was it for some reason?

204
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,165
Where's this?

205
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:04,457
ALBA: It's where I was born.
It's called L'Escargot.

206
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,915
OSWALD: Tell me what happened,
in detail.

207
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,540
You know what happened.

208
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,999
Paula and Griselda
were shopping for china...

209
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:20,915
- What was Griselda wearing?
- A green hat, black shoes.

210
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,915
- We left there about 3:00...
- Was she wearing a scarf?

211
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:27,249
Yes. We turned out
of the car park and then...

212
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,290
Why was she buying china?

213
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:34,749
(LAUGHS) She said she needed china.
She bought 6 soup-bowls...

214
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,915
What were they like?

215
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:42,040
They were white with blue markings
and an egg-timer and a milk-jug.

216
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:45,957
An egg-timer? What the hell
did she want with an egg-timer?

217
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,582
I imagine, Oswald, to time eggs.

218
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:52,165
- Well, why would she want to time eggs?
- Oswald, think what you're saying.

219
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,957
What else did she buy?

220
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,499
Paula wanted to go to the fishmonger.

221
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,457
- I bought a lobster.
- Why did you buy a lobster for?

222
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:05,999
- Oswald, this is getting silly.
- Did my wife buy anything?

223
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,165
Oh, yes, prawns.

224
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,915
- Prawns?
- Yes!

225
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,415
Thank you! That will do for now.

226
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,582
But all this is a long way back
in the story.

227
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,415
Oh, well. Thank you, for telling me.

228
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,749
Oswald, where are you going?

229
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:25,165
ATTENBOROUGH:
The variety of shape, form and structure

230
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,957
in the development of animals
at this time is extraordinary.

231
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:33,540
Side-scuttling crabs,
slow-moving snails,

232
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:37,832
animals that look like stones,
that take on the colour of sand,

233
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:41,124
animals that resemble plants,
that scavenge,

234
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:44,124
that develop poisons
and stinging apparatus,

235
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:47,082
that live on detritus and each other,

236
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:51,874
creating systems of defence and attack,
whose ingenuity is limitless.

237
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,499
Anything in the papers, then?

238
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:02,124
- Why don't you sit down, Plate?
- Thanks very much, Oliver.

239
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,790
I heard you was in here.

240
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:07,749
- There's a funny smell in here.
- It's me, I've stopped washing.

241
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,207
PLATE: Now, I'm sorry,
to hear about your wife.

242
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,874
OLIVER: So am I.

243
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:16,707
Venus de Milo has been asking after you.

244
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,040
(SCOFFS)

245
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,374
Everyone's pimp and messenger,
eh, Plate?

246
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:22,749
Suit yourself.

(MILO READING)

248
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:43,582
OLIVER: Milo,
have you ever done it with animals?

249
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:45,874
If that's what you want,
if it would help,

250
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:47,624
I could invent for you.

251
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:50,040
It'll cost ï¿½5 a story.

252
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:55,624
That's what Anaï¿½s Nin charged in 1927,
only she did it professionally.

253
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,582
I haven't started professionally, yet.

254
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:02,540
ï¿½5 or an introduction to a publisher.

255
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:07,832
- Or a credit note to a large bookshop...
- That's all right! All right, go on!

256
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,874
MILO: Once upon a time,
there were three bears...

257
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:14,249
OLIVER: No nursery stories.

258
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:16,790
MILO: No? All right.

259
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:24,249
A circus owner in Anchorage
kept a polar bear called Fairbanks

260
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:26,249
to entertain Eskimo wives...

261
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:29,124
Unlikely!
And how come you know about Alaska?

262
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,332
I was attentive in geography.

263
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:35,665
The bear had a narrow snout,

264
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:40,499
a sweet nature,
and a rough and probing tongue.

265
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:42,040
It also liked honey...

266
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:44,082
It's beginning to sound
like a bedtime story.

267
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:46,915
- Isn't that just what you wanted?
- And there are no bees in Alaska.

268
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,832
There are as many bees
in Alaska as snails.

269
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:52,415
Why do you like snails?

270
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:54,082
OLIVER: They're a nice
primitive form of life.

271
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:56,124
They helped the world decay

272
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:59,124
and they're hermaphrodite
and can satisfy their own sexual needs.

273
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:01,957
MILO: I don't believe it.
OLIVER: Neither do I.

274
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:06,082
The circus owner by leasing out
the bear with a jar of honey

275
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:08,457
had two profitable sources of income.

276
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:11,582
God, Milo! This is another
whingeing story about money.

277
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:14,915
- And I disapprove of circuses.
- MILO: I disapprove of zoos.

278
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,790
OLIVER: Just shut up and get out.

279

Take that off. Put this on.

314
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:55,582
It belongs to my wife.

315
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,457
And this hat.

316
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,957
Open the coat down the front.

317
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:26,415
Fold your arms.

318
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:31,957
All right, begin.

319
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:37,249
In Botswana,
they kept a bull in a cave...

320
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:38,832
I've heard it.

321
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:41,457
You have? Hmm.

322
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:44,165
Well...

323
00:27:44,916 --> 00:27:48,999
In the 1870s,
in the Regent's Park Zoo in London

324
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:55,749
there was an enclosure
reserved for certain rare animals

325
00:27:55,791 --> 00:28:01,457
that came to be called,
"The Obscene Animals Enclosure."

326
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:08,582
One of the animals,
in this special enclosure,

327
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:13,082
was a toad.
At least it had the body of a toad.

328
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:15,624
It was all your bloody fault!

329
00:28:15,708 --> 00:28:18,082
- What was?
- The death of my wife!

330
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:19,457
I see.

331
00:28:19,541 --> 00:28:25,082
I'm expected to have a pilot's licence?
How could I anticipate swans?

332
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:29,624
You were wearing white feathers
and you were driving a Ford Mercury.

333
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,915
- So?
- You were asking for trouble.

334
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,082
Why?

335
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:37,999
You said you took mercury
to procure an abortion.

336
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,582
You were pregnant.

337
00:28:40,666 --> 00:28:43,415
How the hell did you know
I was pregnant?

338
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:46,582
Pregnant women
are notoriously unreliable.

339
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:52,249
Especially, when they're trying
to procure an abortion.

340
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:56,207
It was all your fault, you bitch!

341
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,457

I normally get 25 for 4,000 words.

346
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,790
That's one-eighth of what Pauline Rï¿½age
got for The Story of O.

347
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,249
- Did I tell it well?
- Yes!

348
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:26,290
Write it down,
I'll see it gets published.

349
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:28,582
That's what your brother said.

350
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:29,832
Is it?

351
00:29:32,708 --> 00:29:36,165
Isn't it time you and he
became a little more friendly?

352
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,665
How is he?

353
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:42,374
He's miserable

354
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:45,624

MILO: With an apple?

357
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:57,415
OLIVER: In the intestines,
in the liver, pancreas,

358
00:29:57,458 --> 00:30:00,874
the spleen, near the womb.

359
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:06,332
MILO: I'm going to see Oliver.
Do you want me to give him a message?

360
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:09,999
OSWALD: No, I've got nothing to say.

361
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:14,499
Yes, tell him to look after himself.

Tell him, I'm bleeding. He'll come.

379
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:53,582
He always used to come
when I was bleeding.

HOYTEN: What's Oliver looking for?

381
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:02,415
I don't know.
I mean, look at all this stuff.

382
00:32:05,416 --> 00:32:08,207
Maybe he's looking for an answer
to his wife's death.

383
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:11,040
He will not find it here.
This is just a straightforward account.

ATTENBOROUGH: The squid

is among the most intelligent
of the invertebrates.

Have I got to sit through them all?

I was pregnant.

394
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:46,915
I not only lost a leg in that crash,
I lost a child.

395
00:32:47,291 --> 00:32:50,207
Though I wasn't,
by any means, trying to.

- De Milo.
- ALBA: Who is she?

409
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:51,290
Actually, her trade name is Venus,
her clients call her De Milo.

He's the surgeon who removed my leg.

432
00:35:05,916 --> 00:35:09,040
He wants to be a painter,
a Dutch painter.

00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:12,165
In fact, the Dutch painter Vermeer,
no less!

434
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,040

only painted 26 paintings

Van Meegeren.

441

He's the cousin of the faker

the lady standing at a virginal.

445

I suspect it's because
you never see her legs.

446

She's not standing really.

447
00:35:48,166 --> 00:35:50,915
She's strapped and stitched
to her music stool.

448
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:54,749
Van Meegeren has a great reputation
for stitching.

Stitching?

450

- No, I can't.

- Because...

460
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:32,665
those two brothers don't
get too close to Alba Bewick.

461
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:34,957
How do I do that?

462
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:37,290
Distract them.

463
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:39,874

Oliver!

470
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:12,999
I was thinking, at the crash,
which way was the wind blowing?

471
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:15,874
Was it blowing off the buildings
at the north side,

472
00:37:15,916 --> 00:37:17,582
or the buildings on the south side?

473
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:19,915
Stop, Oliver, enough.

474
00:37:19,958 --> 00:37:23,749
You've got to stop!
What difference does it make?

475
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:26,957
You exhaust me with your obsessions.
Both of you!

476
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:28,749
You're our only witness.

477
00:37:28,791 --> 00:37:30,999
What sort of witness was I?

478
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:35,290
In searing pain?
A face full of feathers? An egg yolk?

479
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:40,415
My leg smashed to pulp, bleeding.
And you ask me for wind directions.

480
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:43,374
Sorry.

481
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:47,874
- Where's Beta?
- She's with Oswald.

482
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:52,249
Look, it was an accident.

483
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:54,874
5,000 accidents happen every day.

484
00:37:54,916 --> 00:37:57,540
- This one's...
- Bizarre, tragic, farcical!

485
00:37:57,583 --> 00:38:00,249
- This one is different...
- They're acts of God!

486
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:04,415
Fit only to amaze the survivors
and irritate the insurance company.

487
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:06,582
This one is different, for God's sake!

488
00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:07,707
Is it?

489
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:11,624
The wives of two zoologists die in a car
driven by a woman called Bewick,

490
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:14,165
who's attacked by a swan on Swan's Way!

491
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:18,624
You are already beginning to build
yourself a case for the supernatural.

492
00:38:18,708 --> 00:38:21,374
But another set of details,
from the same crash,

493
00:38:21,416 --> 00:38:24,374
could produce something
completely different!

494
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:27,332
(SIGHING)

495
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:38,499
And what about me?

496
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,999
Don't I deserve some consideration?

497
00:38:44,208 --> 00:38:48,582
With a daughter, who can't sit still,
and why should she?

498
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,207
Take her out for me, will you?

499
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:56,874
Van Meegeren is going to fit me
with an artificial leg tomorrow.

500
00:38:58,708 --> 00:38:59,915
Kiss me.

501
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:04,665
I haven't been kissed since your wife
kissed me a month ago.

502
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:07,415
Kiss me on the cheek.

503
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:10,124
Here, where she did.

504
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:27,749
And the ostrich eats anything at all.

505
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:30,457
And buries its head in the sand
when it's afraid.

506
00:39:30,958 --> 00:39:35,082
- And the elephant lives to be 100.
- And never forgets a face.

507
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:39,124
So, you see between us,
we know everything.

508
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:40,749
You don't know everything.

509
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:42,915
Between us, we do.

510
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:44,790
All right, then.

511
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:48,332
You see that woman over there?

512
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:51,665
What color knickers is she wearing?

513
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,999
- Red ones, to match her hat.
- No, she isn't.

514
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:56,082
- How do you know?
- I know.

515
00:39:58,375 --> 00:40:00,165
Well, Oliver,

516
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:02,957
you could always go and ask
and find out.

517
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:05,582
Go on, ask her.

518
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,499
Excuse me, madam,
I'm sorry to bother you.

519
00:40:20,583 --> 00:40:22,790
I think we may just have met before.

520
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:26,040
May I trouble you in the interest
of that child's education?

521
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:27,874
May I ask you a few questions?

522
00:40:27,916 --> 00:40:30,582
- Like?
- Like? Uh...

523
00:40:31,583 --> 00:40:33,665
Are these ostrich feathers?

524
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:38,749
- Who are you exactly? Do I know you?
- I'm an animal behaviourist, madam.

525
00:40:39,666 --> 00:40:42,957
Then your question doesn't sound
very well informed.

526
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:47,082
- What animals are you a behaviourist of?
- All animals. Madam...

527
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:49,582
Can I ask you a personal question?

528
00:40:50,791 --> 00:40:54,582
Which do you prefer...
What color are your knickers?

529
00:40:54,625 --> 00:40:56,540
- Black and white striped.
- Thank you!

530
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:58,207
It's a pleasure.

531
00:41:05,125 --> 00:41:10,624
- You see, black and white stripes.
- You didn't know. I knew all the time.

532
00:41:10,708 --> 00:41:13,249
- You did?
- Yes, I saw them yesterday.

533
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:17,165
Well, why did you make me
go through all that, then?

534
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,582
Excuse me.

535
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:24,499
Just in case you don't believe me,
I can show you.

536
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:27,457
Ah! No, thank you very much!
We believe you.

537
00:41:27,541 --> 00:41:31,457
- I insist!
- It's really quite all right. Thank you!

538
00:41:34,416 --> 00:41:37,457
If you are both zoologists as you claim,

539
00:41:37,541 --> 00:41:39,915
you pride yourself on your powers
of observation.

540
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:42,499
You must continue these experiments.

541
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:47,082
If you don't look at the evidence,
you're cheating the child.

542
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:51,499
Come with me or I swear
I'll kick this table over.

543
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:54,207
Go on, then.

544
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:57,957
God!

545
00:41:58,041 --> 00:42:00,165
And now I'll knock over this one,
if you don't go with me at once.

546
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,165
All right! Where to?

547
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:04,707
Just follow me.

548
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:09,582
Go on, then.

549
00:42:10,416 --> 00:42:12,040
Thanks very much.

550
00:42:18,166 --> 00:42:21,707
All right, smart zoologist.
Now see for yourself.

551
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,749
(CHUCKLES UNCOMFORTABLY)

552
00:42:26,416 --> 00:42:27,582
Go on.

553
00:42:31,958 --> 00:42:33,249
(EXCLAIMING)

554
00:42:33,291 --> 00:42:35,582
That will cost you ï¿½40.

555
00:42:35,666 --> 00:42:39,124
And there's another thing,
Van Meegeren and I believe

556
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:41,249
it's better for you
and your precious brother

557
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:45,082
not to see Alba Bewick,
before it's too late.

558
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:46,249
Too late?

559
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:49,415
If you both feel so lonely,
you can't help yourself,

560
00:42:49,458 --> 00:42:51,290
come and see me.

561
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:54,790
Together, if you must.
And I don't tell dirty stories.

562
00:43:18,583 --> 00:43:22,415
Don't press too hard, my back aches.

563
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:26,540
- Where does it ache?
- Across the hips and along the spine.

564
00:43:26,583 --> 00:43:31,207
Don't worry. It's a natural condition.
Let's have you in a sitting position.

565
00:43:33,416 --> 00:43:36,832
- Tell me, what happened to my leg?
- What do you mean?

566
00:43:36,916 --> 00:43:40,415
- Where is it now? Have you sold it?
- It was incinerated.

567
00:43:40,458 --> 00:43:42,582
- Where?
- Don't concern yourself with it.

568
00:43:42,666 --> 00:43:45,749
- Where?
- In the hospital incinerator.

569
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:48,707
What is your connection with the zoo?

570
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,707
I am veterinarian consultant.
Why do you ask?

571
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:54,999
- Do you perform amputations on animals?
- If they are necessary.

572
00:43:56,041 --> 00:43:58,915
Do you fit animals
with artificial limbs?

573
00:43:58,958 --> 00:44:01,499
Where are these questions leading, Alba?

574
00:44:01,583 --> 00:44:05,082
Is animal surgery
so different from human surgery?

575
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:06,457
(CHUCKLES)

576
00:44:06,541 --> 00:44:08,665
There are many similarities.

577
00:44:21,041 --> 00:44:23,582
- What's this for?
- It's for a surprise.

578
00:44:23,625 --> 00:44:25,249
What sort of a surprise?

579
00:44:25,333 --> 00:44:27,749
Don't be alarmed.
I'm sure you'll like it.

580
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:30,957
What sort of surprise
will it be if we tell you?

581
00:44:31,041 --> 00:44:37,040
- You take too many liberties.
- I do. They're all in your interest.

582
00:44:42,833 --> 00:44:45,915
- Is that a real angelfish?
- Yes.

583
00:44:45,958 --> 00:44:47,415
BETA: Can it fly?

584
00:44:47,458 --> 00:44:49,415
OLIVER: Well, if it could,
it still couldn't escape.

585
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,957
It's a caged fish.

586
00:44:51,041 --> 00:44:53,915
- BETA: Can it swim away?
- Where would it swim to?

587
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,624
The Sargasso sea.
That's where all fish go.

588
00:44:56,708 --> 00:44:57,749
OLIVER: Is it?

589
00:44:57,791 --> 00:45:01,124
BETA: Yes, that's where
my mother's leg has gone.

590
00:45:01,208 --> 00:45:03,915
OLIVER: How come?
BETA: It was taken by a shark.

591
00:45:03,958 --> 00:45:06,499
OSWALD: Called Van Meegeren, perhaps.

592
00:45:06,583 --> 00:45:10,457
BETA: Who's he?
OLIVER: Oh, just a keeper of legs.

593
00:45:11,958 --> 00:45:14,249
BETA: Do you keep
lots of black and white fish?

594
00:45:14,333 --> 00:45:16,665
- OLIVER: Yes.
- BETA: Zebra-fish?

595
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,624
OSWALD: We also have parrot-fish,

596
00:45:18,708 --> 00:45:21,790
elephant-fish,
rat-fish and tiger-sharks.

597
00:45:21,875 --> 00:45:25,749
OLIVER: You see, fish anticipated
everything that was to come.

598
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:29,082
I don't know why evolution bothered
to go on. Why go further?

599
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:31,415
OSWALD: There are no swan-fish.

600
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:41,624
ALBA: Oliver? Oswald?

601
00:45:41,708 --> 00:45:43,749
What are you doing here so late?

602
00:45:43,833 --> 00:45:45,082
Reptiles.

603
00:45:46,083 --> 00:45:47,124
ALBA: I want to tell you about...

604
00:45:47,208 --> 00:45:48,582
(SHUSHING)

605
00:46:08,916 --> 00:46:10,374
Sit here.

606
00:46:10,416 --> 00:46:14,124
ATTENBOROUGH: Reptiles differed from
their immediate amphibious ancestors

607
00:46:14,208 --> 00:46:17,665
by having a skin capable
of retaining body moisture.

608
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:20,374
Which meant that animals
for the first time...

609
00:46:20,416 --> 00:46:23,624
ALBA: Isn't it a bit late
to be watching reptiles?

610
00:46:23,708 --> 00:46:26,207
OSWALD: 400 million years too late.

611
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:31,665
ALBA: What's all this watching for?
OSWALD: I'm trying to work it out.

612
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:33,540
What out?

613
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:37,249
Why we should come all this way,
slowly and painfully,

614
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:40,749
inch by inch, fraction by fraction,
second by second,

615
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:43,957
so that my wife should die by a swan?

616
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:45,874
ALBA: Very personal view of evolution.

617
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:49,749
OSWALD: What have a swan and my wife
got in common?

618
00:46:49,791 --> 00:46:51,749
- ALBA: Me!
- You?

619
00:46:51,833 --> 00:46:55,040
And my car, my amputated leg,

620
00:46:55,916 --> 00:46:57,124
my lost child.

621
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,582
ATTENBOROUGH:
Before the vast majority of reptiles

622
00:46:59,666 --> 00:47:00,832
died out mysteriously...

623
00:47:00,916 --> 00:47:02,582
OSWALD: Reptiles didn't die out.

624
00:47:03,958 --> 00:47:07,249
They grew feathers and became birds.

625
00:47:07,333 --> 00:47:10,499
So our swan was a flying lizard?

626
00:47:10,583 --> 00:47:12,915
Did Jupiter know that
when he raped Leda?

627
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:15,457
He didn't rape her. She was willing.

628

(SCOFFS) Mon dieu, Oswald!
Are you implying I was?

629
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:19,957
What do you mean?

630
00:47:20,041 --> 00:47:23,082
You've been trying to tell me,
you and Oliver,

631
00:47:23,125 --> 00:47:25,582
that I was responsible
for your wife's death.

632
00:47:25,666 --> 00:47:28,332
No, we haven't.

633
00:47:29,541 --> 00:47:31,915
And things have suddenly changed.

of new sexual apparatus...

635
00:47:37,833 --> 00:47:39,582
Where is Oliver?

636
00:47:39,625 --> 00:47:41,082
He's working.

637
00:47:42,791 --> 00:47:47,082
He keeps stealing snails,
letting butterflies free.

638
00:47:47,875 --> 00:47:52,249
He should go there.
It's full of snails and butterflies.

639
00:47:52,791 --> 00:47:58,749
If you left a bicycle by the back door,
and you went indoors to use the toilet,

640
00:47:58,833 --> 00:48:03,832
when you came out,
the saddle was covered in snails,

641
00:48:03,916 --> 00:48:06,082
licking up your sweat.

642
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:10,832
I haven't been there for 15 years.

643
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:14,374
I'd quite like to die there.

644

You must go there for me.
You might find my Felipe Arc-en-Ciel.

- Oh! I don't know, I've forgotten.

00:48:33,416 --> 00:48:35,374
You'd better try them all.

Ah! Start with this one. It looks right.

651
00:48:48,583 --> 00:48:52,415
OSWALD: Why'd you keep all these?
ALBA: I've always had them.

652

You must never throw a key away.

- What leg?

Don't be so sensitive.

You'd be surprised,
what a novelty it is.

Come on. I want more than a kiss.

The charge is ï¿½30.

(CLATTERING)

00:50:31,833 --> 00:50:32,999
Never.

667
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,874
Do you think that
black and white stripes are useful?

668
00:50:37,625 --> 00:50:39,249
I'm sure they are.

669
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:43,499
Since the zebra
is such a beautiful animal,

670
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:47,249
you'd have thought, perhaps, that man
would have invented a fanciful hybrid.

671
00:50:47,291 --> 00:50:48,415
Wouldn't you?

672
00:50:49,166 --> 00:50:51,165
You know, like a centaur.

673

A black and white centaur,
half-woman, half-zebra,

with striped breasts,
ever-ready haunches and a white tail.

No black hair.

676
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:11,457
They'd only put it in a zoo.

677
00:51:12,041 --> 00:51:15,915
- Next to the unicorn.
- And the mermaid.

678

Animals are always kept for profit.

679
00:51:21,208 --> 00:51:23,624
Maybe that's what they are for.

680
00:51:23,708 --> 00:51:26,624
There are many ways of making a profit.

681

If I had the money to own a zoo,

682
00:51:29,166 --> 00:51:31,665
I would stock it with
mythological animals.

from the attentions
of Oliver and Oswald.

I can't patrol the world like a sentry.

691
00:52:10,958 --> 00:52:13,540
You could surely offer more
attractive alternatives

692
00:52:13,583 --> 00:52:15,624
than a woman with one leg.

693
00:52:18,083 --> 00:52:21,582
Would they be interested in a woman
with no legs at all?

694
00:52:22,875 --> 00:52:26,582
Since you, obviously, put more
interest in her than you do in me,

695
00:52:26,666 --> 00:52:29,082
you ought to be able to answer
the question yourself.

- He wrote fiction, so he doesn't count.

To protect to me
from unnecessary attentions.

- Oh, you're imagining it.
- Pinocchio's legs were wooden.

Would a crocodile do?

Well, it might,

I could tell you about

00:58:02,083 --> 00:58:04,624
- At the moment, I am.
- Why you?

782
00:58:04,708 --> 00:58:06,749
'Cause I'm enjoying this!

783
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:09,040
You're here but worried
about exploitation.

784
00:58:09,291 --> 00:58:12,249
And Alba's not here
but in bed without a leg.

785
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:35,874
Now, open your eyes.

786
00:58:37,041 --> 00:58:39,124
We've not found your Felipe Arc-en-Ciel,

787
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:41,707
but we have found you an apartment.

788
00:58:42,208 --> 00:58:44,707
Now you'll be safe
from art and medicine.

789
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:47,665
ALBA: It looks very expensive!

790
00:58:49,208 --> 00:58:51,165
And a little bit vulgar.

791
00:58:52,583 --> 00:58:58,082
It's certainly convenient for the zoo.
And who's going to pay for all this?

792
00:58:58,166 --> 00:58:59,207
OSWALD: We are!

793
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:03,540
And here is a reminder
of how it really goes.

(THE TEDDY BEARS PICNIC PLAYING)

795
00:59:06,916 --> 00:59:08,915
âª If you go down in the woods today

796
00:59:08,958 --> 00:59:11,457
âª You're sure of a big surprise âª

797
00:59:11,541 --> 00:59:15,415
I see,
exchanging one prison for another.

798
00:59:16,291 --> 00:59:18,624
But the music is still the same.

799
00:59:20,541 --> 00:59:23,790
- So, I am to be a kept woman?
- Not so you'd notice.

800
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:27,165
Will I be able to escape if I want to?

801
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:29,707
Of course!
You know, I don't believe in cages.

802
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:34,624
- Suppose, I don't want to escape.
- Good grief, Alba!

803
00:59:34,708 --> 00:59:36,707
You're free to come and go,
as you please.

804
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:40,040
Good! Just want to get that straight.

805
00:59:40,083 --> 00:59:42,582
You know they clip
the wings of birds in the zoo.

806
00:59:42,625 --> 00:59:45,040
Yeah, but they always grow again.

807
00:59:45,375 --> 00:59:48,915
Now that wasn't a such a bright thing
to say in the circumstances, was it?

808
00:59:48,958 --> 00:59:50,124
Sorry.

809
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:54,832
- Who has the keys?
- You can have the keys.

810
00:59:54,916 --> 00:59:58,290
The keys aren't in it.
Look, you are as free as a bird!

OLIVER: Prove it?
ALBA: Mmm-hmm.

814
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,749
OLIVER: All right.

815
01:00:11,791 --> 01:00:15,457
All right, you just sit on your balcony
at 9:00 tomorrow morning

816
01:00:15,541 --> 01:00:18,915
and I'll show you how easy it is
to free birds.

817
01:00:18,958 --> 01:00:23,290
ALBA: Okay, let's see how all that
changes in the face of new evidence.

818
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:30,832
I am about to become a mother,
and you are about to become a father.

819
01:00:30,916 --> 01:00:32,249
- Or fathers.
- You what?

820
01:00:32,333 --> 01:00:33,457
- You are?
- I am.

821
01:00:33,541 --> 01:00:34,582
- Good Lord.
- Why not?

822
01:00:34,625 --> 01:00:36,249
- You can?
- Of course.

823
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:39,624
- Is leglessness a form of contraception?
- I'm not sure.

824
01:00:39,708 --> 01:00:41,249
- You're not sure?
- I'm delighted.

825
01:00:41,291 --> 01:00:45,707
You're delighted.
A pregnant cripple and you're delighted?

826
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:47,749
Think of what it will do
to my sense of balance.

827
01:00:47,791 --> 01:00:51,415
- It might help give you more stability.
- Then you recommend it.

828
01:00:51,458 --> 01:00:55,415
Recommendation's one thing,
a woman on crutches is another.

829
01:00:55,458 --> 01:00:57,915
So, who's the father?

830
01:00:58,583 --> 01:01:00,249
Well, well, well.

831
01:01:00,875 --> 01:01:02,624
Why don't you discuss it
between yourselves?

832
01:01:02,708 --> 01:01:04,082
Well, don't you know?

833
01:01:04,125 --> 01:01:08,582
Grand dieu, does an animal behaviourist
need to ask such questions?

834
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:12,790
As far as I'm concerned you both are.

835
01:01:12,875 --> 01:01:14,749
- But you're...
- No buts!

836
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:19,540
You are brothers, aren't you?

837
01:01:19,583 --> 01:01:22,332
What's a few spermatozoa among brothers?

838
01:01:58,916 --> 01:02:03,165
Oliver,
invigorating as the sight may be to you,

839
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:08,457
perhaps you can tell me
something about their escape.

840
01:02:08,541 --> 01:02:09,832
You think I should know?

841
01:02:10,916 --> 01:02:15,124
FALLAST: I understand that you are
critical about my custody of birds.

842
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:22,332
They look like twins.
Could they fly like that, do you think?

843
01:02:22,416 --> 01:02:25,332
- Joined together like that?
- OSWALD: They could learn.

844
01:02:26,583 --> 01:02:29,415
- Could my fish learn?
- I'm sure.

845
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,415
It's lonely.

846
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:35,624
I'll show you what to do. Come with me.

847
01:02:35,708 --> 01:02:37,957
ATTENBOROUGH:
Both the tiger and the zebra

848
01:02:38,041 --> 01:02:39,957
carry their own prison bars.

849
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:45,249
But whereas the tiger's stripes,
undoubtedly serve as camouflage,

850
01:02:45,333 --> 01:02:46,582
the stripes of the zebra

851
01:02:46,666 --> 01:02:49,749
are now no longer believed
to be protective colouring.

852
01:02:51,416 --> 01:02:55,082
OLIVER: The flamingo, Jerome,
lives on crustaceans.

853
01:02:55,125 --> 01:02:56,874
The richer the diet,
the pinker the feathers.

854
01:02:57,333 --> 01:02:59,082
Your birds are too pale.

855
01:02:59,166 --> 01:03:02,165
Fresh prawns
are rather difficult to keep

856
01:03:02,458 --> 01:03:03,749
as I'm sure you understand.

857
01:03:03,833 --> 01:03:06,874
OLIVER: A flamingo enclosure
is 10 feet by 12.

858
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:11,749
You have 123 birds which gives each bird
one square foot each.

859
01:03:11,833 --> 01:03:14,665
FALLAST: Flamingos normally roost
standing on one another's feet.

860
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:19,790
OSWALD: There you are, a mirror image.
It's not that impossible to find.

861
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,707
OLIVER: Flamingos never
experience a temperature

862
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:24,665
lower than five degrees centigrade.

863
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:26,582
FALLAST: Nor do they
respect traffic signals.

864
01:03:27,416 --> 01:03:30,749
Your fugitive cold and anaemic flamingos

865
01:03:30,791 --> 01:03:33,499
don't look terribly at home
waiting for a taxi, do they?

866
01:03:33,583 --> 01:03:36,915
Well, you've got it wrong.
They're waiting for a bus

867
01:03:37,416 --> 01:03:38,749
to Africa.

868
01:03:39,416 --> 01:03:42,707
How charming. Oliver, a warning.

869
01:03:43,583 --> 01:03:46,915
Snails, butterflies and now birds
have escaped from the zoo.

870
01:03:46,958 --> 01:03:49,290
I can't prove that
you're responsible, Oliver,

871
01:03:49,375 --> 01:03:53,124
but I'm sure my suspicions
are not too far from the truth.

872
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:54,582
Be careful.

Oh, you're joking. You can't be serious.

Why do we have to have
two of everything?

- Symmetry is all.
- We're twins.

I know you are.

Just because you've chosen now
to reveal your amazing secret,

919
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:55,207
doesn't mean I have to be surprised.

- Who told you?
- No one.

- They knew we were brothers,

that we were twins.

And have you tried?

In this present maimed company
I can admit to anything.

1116

A white mare was my downfall, literally.

1117

but I still lust after riding her.

up and down this cage every day.

Do you really think it will walk
fewer miles with you inside him?

with a crease in your trousers?

not go in there with them.

How can I let out the tiger?
They'd only shoot it.

Oliver, if you don't come out
we'll shoot it anyway.

I can't consider the possibilities

could we satisfy the experts?

You seem to have satisfied

1147

By providing the zoo
with a one-legged gorilla.

1148
01:26:16,583 --> 01:26:19,165
Do you feel that the gorilla
was ill-used?

1149
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:22,082
If you feel that my care is incomplete,
I must look at the animal again.

1150
01:26:22,125 --> 01:26:25,207
What for? To amputate its other leg?

1151
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:28,374
If it's painful, cut it off.
Is that your answer?

1152
01:26:28,416 --> 01:26:31,874
Animals on the whole are designed
with a view of symmetry.

1153
01:26:31,916 --> 01:26:34,624
Surely in your experiments
you must have seen it.

1154
01:26:34,708 --> 01:26:38,207
One of decay's first characteristics
is to spoil that symmetry,

Yes, it was!

It's not like you to speculate
on the weather.

you've been waiting for, perhaps.

what you've been wanting to do

- Yes.

- Yes.

- Yes, I am.
