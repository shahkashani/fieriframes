About four nights now.

You're not sleeping at all?

Well, some, but real restless.

Well, I think four nights
is a little too soon to tell.

not eat or drink anything

I think I might need
to try some medication.

Why do you say that?

398

The reason I've been
having trouble sleeping

is these dreams
I've been having.

I didn't think
it was anything at first,

but then
the other day I woke up

402
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:29,568
and the bed was wet.

403

Couple days before that,

406

I had a dream that
my dog attacked me

are variable.

Okay.

00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:03,462
I'm gonna start by asking
you some questions.

640
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:07,041
Okay. I already answered all
the questions on the form.

641
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:08,466
Yeah, I know.
I looked at them,

642
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,546
but I need to get
a profile started on you.

643
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:13,552
Right. Well...

644
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,349
Out of the five
possible symptoms

645
00:52:19,428 --> 00:52:21,351
needed to be diagnosed
with schizophrenia,

646
00:52:21,764 --> 00:52:24,984
delusions, hallucinations,
disorganized speech,

647
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:28,689
disorganized behavior
and the negative symptoms,

648
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,024
I've had two.

649
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,528
Delusions and hallucinations.

650
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:40,579
So, I took this quiz
in the back of the book.

651
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:45,004
I scored a five
out of a possible 20.

652
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:48,082
Schizophrenia starts
at 12. So...

653
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:53,838
They say it might be
a brief psychotic disorder.

654
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:59,101
Yeah. Whatever it is,
I need to know what to do

655
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:01,182
or what to get on

656
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:03,309
to get this thing
under control.

657
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,815
Look. I'm a counselor.

658
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:11,984

but I'm not a psychiatrist.

00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:13,566

anything to you.

00:53:13,649 --> 00:53:17,529
I can talk to you, I can
recommend where to send you,

661
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,113
but that's it.

662
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:26,834
Now, that said, if you
want to talk, I'll listen.

663
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:31,421
For a lot of people,
that's a good start.

664
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:35,217
Now you said here

665
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,638
that your mother was diagnosed

666
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:39,467
with paranoid schizophrenia
in her 30s.

667
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:40,972
And you're at 35.

668
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:44,475
You wanna talk about that?

669
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:51,816
Yeah, I don't know
my mother's symptoms.

670
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:54,607
I was just 10.

671
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:58,652
My brother was 17. And...

672
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:05,159
I don't know. She just
left me in the car

673
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,289
in the parking lot
at the grocery store one day.

674
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:13,088
And she didn't come back.

675
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,431
And then they
found her a week later

676
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:20,928
eating trash out of a dumpster

677
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:22,851
in Northern Kentucky.

678
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:27,807
My dad had to put her in the
State Hospital in Columbus.

679
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:32,690
And she's been in
assisted living ever since.

680
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:38,491
Yep.

681
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:41,495
My dad raised me.

682
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:45,161
He died last April.

683
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:51,171
So tell me about these dreams.

our schedule will be, but...

That's all right.

686
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:15,862
But I really do think you should
continue with the sign language.

687
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:19,279
And any additional therapies that
kids need for the cochlear implant.

688
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:20,860
SAMANTHA: Absolutely.
Okay.

You didn't say one word
about this to me.

Don't you think
you owe me that?

might respect me enough

what I'd have to say?

and something happened.

01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:16,124
And we fought.

797
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:20,207
And he ran it through my leg.

798
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:31,136
(STUTTERING)
It's hard to explain,

I'm afraid

802
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:54,120
something might be coming.

01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:16,851
I've been to a counselor.

808
01:08:19,012 --> 01:08:20,355

809
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:23,520

You know what I come from.

811
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:36,412
And I promised myself...

812
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:46,164
I promised myself
I would never leave.

813
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:58,639
And I am doing
everything that I can

814
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:02,889
to make that true.

815
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:31,542
Okay, since the doctor's
approved her surgery,

816
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:34,049
we just need to
get her scheduled.

817

The next possible opening
is the 21st of next month.

01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:56,029
I don't think
we'll have any problem.

824
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:58,737
We should be able to get 20,
maybe 30 in this next week.

825
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:02,116
But we're looking to see how
that's gonna shape up, so...

826
01:10:03,241 --> 01:10:04,834
Curtis?
Yeah.

827
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:06,794
What do you think?

828
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:08,291
Yeah. That sounds good.

829
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,832
We'll get it done.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

831
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:23,845
Come in.

832
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:27,898
What you need, Curtis?

833
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:32,774
I need a favor, Jim.

834
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:33,980
What's that?

835
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:36,486
Can you take Dewart
off my crew?

836
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:38,989
Just reassign him
someplace else.

837
01:10:43,656 --> 01:10:46,830
What's the trouble?
He not pulling his weight?

838
01:10:47,785 --> 01:10:50,004
No, nothing like that.
He's a good worker.

839
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:52,207
He's a good man.
He's my friend.

840
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:56,090
I think it'd be easier

841
01:10:56,169 --> 01:10:58,672
not being in charge of
someone I'm so close to.

842
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:01,803
You know, I understand.

843
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:06,934
This is part of what it means
to manage people, Curtis.

844
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:08,435
You're gonna
have to learn that.

845
01:11:09,307 --> 01:11:11,776
Yes, sir.
I appreciate that, but...

846
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:16,148
Well, it would just be
very helpful in this case.

847
01:11:17,315 --> 01:11:18,362
Okay.

848
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:21,907
Well, I can
put him with Russell.

849
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:23,283
Anybody else you'd prefer?

850
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:25,706
No. Whoever
you think's right.

851
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,993
Okay. Okay.

852
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:31,374
Thank you.

853
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:35,337
You been missing
a lot of work, Curtis.

854
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:39,132
I know. My daughter's had
a lot of doctor's visits.

855
01:11:39,212 --> 01:11:40,384
I haven't let
anything get behind.

856
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:42,553
No. But don't. Okay?

857
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:44,551
Yes, sir.

858
01:11:58,356 --> 01:12:01,109
SAMANTHA: I know they just
usually do oysters and fries,

859
01:12:01,192 --> 01:12:04,116
but what if we did something
healthier on the side?

860
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:06,913
What, like 'slaw?

861
01:12:07,448 --> 01:12:10,247
I don't know.
Maybe a vegetable or salad.

862
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:22,635
Dewart's been telling me how strange
Curtis has been acting lately.

863
01:12:24,257 --> 01:12:25,804
I am so sorry.

864
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,011
It's not like
you don't have enough

865
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:31,189
on your plate with Hannah.

866
01:12:31,264 --> 01:12:32,686
Things are fine.

867
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:39,025
We're fine.

868
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:53,961
Can I help you?

869
01:12:54,662 --> 01:12:55,959
Yeah.

870
01:12:58,457 --> 01:12:59,925
Can I look at one
of these gas masks?

871
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:01,298
Sure.

872
01:13:01,669 --> 01:13:02,795
Which one you want to look at?

873
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:04,631
The newest one.

874
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,972
How much?
$178.

875
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:15,312
Anything cheaper?

876
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:18,694
No. That's the cheapest
one I got in the store.

877
01:13:18,978 --> 01:13:21,527
They go all the way up to $290.

878
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:25,322
I don't know what
you want to spend,

879
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:27,779
but a gas mask ain't something
you want to go cheap on.

880
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:30,998
You got any kids' sizes?

881
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,499
No.

882
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:34,702
Kids can't wear those.

883
01:13:34,785 --> 01:13:37,504
They gotta have a special
thing, it's like a hood.

884
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:40,416
I don't fool with those.

885
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:05,533
What the hell are you doing?

886
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:19,504
What you got going on here?

887
01:14:21,332 --> 01:14:25,883
I'm just adding on
to the storm shelter.

888
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:29,344
Why?
Just because.

889
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:33,678
You running water to it?

890
01:14:33,761 --> 01:14:35,889
Oh, yeah.
From our well.

891
01:14:36,681 --> 01:14:38,979
Running sewer out
to the city line.

892
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:42,565
How much you spending
on this thing?

893
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:43,646
It's not bad.

894
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:44,901
Doesn't look it.

895
01:14:48,776 --> 01:14:50,824
You take your eye off the ball
one minute in this economy

896
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:52,576
and you're screwed.

897
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:54,573
You got the cash for this?

898
01:14:54,657 --> 01:14:55,749
Yeah.

899
01:14:58,202 --> 01:15:00,330
Don't put nothing on credit cards.
That shit'll eat you up.

900
01:15:00,413 --> 01:15:01,585
I'm not.

901
01:15:10,297 --> 01:15:11,970
Samantha called me.

902
01:15:13,426 --> 01:15:14,678
I figured.

903
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:19,189
Called you to
come tell me to quit?

904
01:15:19,265 --> 01:15:21,267
She called
'cause she's worried.

905
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:23,523
Says you've been stressed out.

906
01:15:26,856 --> 01:15:28,449
So?
So what?

907
01:15:29,233 --> 01:15:30,860
You stressed out?

908
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:35,331
No. No more
than anybody else.

909
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:38,542

Hey, look.
You wanna come by

912
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:46,550
and have dinner sometime, Kyle?
That's fine.

913
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:48,502
We'll have a beer and
talk about the old days,

914
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:49,587
but you got something
to say, just say it.

915
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,297
You can stop
that shit right now.

916
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,597
I'll come over there
and remind you

917
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:55,426
what it's like to
get your ass whipped.

918

I'm just coming here
to check on you.

Well, I appreciate it, Kyle.

920

You been to see Mom?

921
01:16:13,694 --> 01:16:15,537
Yeah.
A few days ago.

922
01:16:18,324 --> 01:16:19,917
She all right?

923
01:16:22,078 --> 01:16:23,295
You should see her.

924
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:25,589
Take your girls.

925
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:28,839
Yeah. Yeah,
I'll get around to it.

Mmm-hmm.

927
01:16:37,968 --> 01:16:40,391
You need a hand?
No. I've got it.

928
01:16:43,057 --> 01:16:44,183
Okay.

929
01:16:46,477 --> 01:16:47,945
Call me if you need me, okay?

930
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:49,237
I will.

01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:58,034

you could do me a favor.

for you, okay, buddy?

You sure?
Yeah.

01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:17,182
I know it'll
make my girls happy.

All right. All right.
I will, little brother.

Curtis.

961
01:21:08,947 --> 01:21:10,369
Dewart told me
you took equipment

962
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:13,328
from work for a project
at your house.

963

Said that's why you
wanted him off your crew.

I came out here
to see it myself.

Yeah. It was just
a hauler and a backhoe.

966
01:21:27,341 --> 01:21:30,595
It was Saturday.
I had them back in less than eight hours.

You know that doesn't matter.

She got into a program at OSU,

995
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:18,646
so she'll be
transferring near there.

We cancel the beach trip.

I love you,
but if I open the door,

I don't have a job right now.

Well, I know
that times are hard,

1179
01:51:14,710 --> 01:51:16,963
but I think it's really important
for you to separate yourself

1180
01:51:17,045 --> 01:51:18,638
from that storm shelter.

1181
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:21,763
I think you need to break
away from it for a while.

1182
01:51:21,842 --> 01:51:24,061
We can start you on some
medication that I think will help,

1183
01:51:24,136 --> 01:51:26,810

would mean a lot.

to Myrtle Beach each summer.

We were gonna go this month.

1186
01:51:34,688 --> 01:51:36,782
I think that would be okay

1187
01:51:37,316 --> 01:51:39,944
if we start the medication now.

1188
01:51:41,236 --> 01:51:43,330
And it would give you all some
time to prepare as a family.

1189
01:51:43,405 --> 01:51:45,499
But I want to be clear,

1190
01:51:45,574 --> 01:51:48,293
when Curtis gets back, he'll need
to take more time than that.

1191
01:51:49,328 --> 01:51:50,955
What does that mean?

1192
01:51:52,372 --> 01:51:56,172
I mean that he'll need hands-on
therapy at a real facility.

to leave my family?
