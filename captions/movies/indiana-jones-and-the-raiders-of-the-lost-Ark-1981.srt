The Nazis have discovered Tanis.

166
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:05,650
EATON: Just what does
that mean to you, uh, Tanis?

167
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:06,776
Well, it...

168
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,279
The city of Tanis is one of the possible
resting places of the Lost Ark.

169
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:11,031
The Lost Ark?

170
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:12,365
Yeah, the Ark of the Covenant.

171
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:13,617
The chest the Hebrews used

172
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,035
to carry around
the Ten Commandments.

173
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:16,202
What do you mean,
"commandments"?

174
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:17,787
You talking
about the Ten Commandments?

175
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,956
Yes, the actual
Ten Commandments.

176
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,541
The original stone tablets

177
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,585
that Moses brought down
out of Mount Horeb and smashed,

178
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,712
if you believe
in that sort of thing.

179
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,673
Any of you guys
ever go to Sunday school?

180
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:30,759
- Well, I...
- Oh, look.

181
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:32,427
The Hebrews took
the broken pieces

182
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,888
and put them in the Ark.
When they settled in Canaan,

183
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,599
they put the Ark in a place
called the Temple of Solomon.

184
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:38,725
In Jerusalem.

185
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,310
Where it stayed for many years.

186
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,479
Until, all of a sudden,
whoosh, it's gone.

187
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:43,730
Where?

188
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,690
Well, nobody knows
where or when.

189
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:47,651
However, an Egyptian pharaoh...

190
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:48,735
- Shishak.
- Yes.

191
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:51,571
...invaded the city of Jerusalem
right about 980 BC,

192
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:54,616
and he may have taken the Ark
back to the city of Tanis

193
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,618
and hidden it
in a secret chamber

194
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:57,952
called the Well of Souls.

195
00:17:58,536 --> 00:17:59,621
Secret chamber?

196
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,331
BRODY: However, about a year

197
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,583
after the pharaoh
would return to Egypt,

198
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,920
the city of Tanis was
consumed by the desert

199
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:10,090
in a sandstorm which
lasted a whole year.

200
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,425
Wiped clean by the wrath of God.

201
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,179
Uh-huh.

202
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,972
Obviously, we've come
to the right men.

203
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:19,599
Now you seem to know, uh,

204
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:20,934
all about this Tanis, then.

205
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,435
No, no, not really.

206
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,938
Ravenwood is the real expert.

207
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:27,023
Abner did the first serious work
on Tanis.

208
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:29,651
Collected some of its relics.

209
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,529
It was his obsession, really.

210
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:33,947
But he never found the city.

211
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,367
Frankly, we're somewhat
suspicious of Mr. Ravenwood.

212
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,119
An American being mentioned
so prominently

213
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:41,371
in a secret Nazi cable.

214
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,790
Oh, rubbish.
Ravenwood's no Nazi.

215
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,625
Well, what do the Nazis
want him for, then?

216
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,169
Well, obviously,
the Nazis are looking

217
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:50,046
for the headpiece
to the Staff of Ra

218
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,340
and they think Abner's got it.

219
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:55,093
What exactly is a headpiece
to the Staff of Ra?

220
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,678
Well, the staff
is just a stick...

221
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,012
I don't know, about this big,

222
00:18:58,221 --> 00:18:59,848
nobody really knows
for sure how high...

223
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:02,934
And it's... it's, uh...
it's capped

224
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,520
with an elaborate headpiece...

225
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:08,565
in the shape of the sun,
with a crystal in the center.

226
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,233
And what you did was

227
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:13,069
you take the staff
to a special room in Tanis...

228
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:14,487
A map room with a miniature

229
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:15,989
of the city all laid out
on the floor,

230
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,074
and if you put the staff
in a certain place,

231
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:21,035
at a certain time of day,
the sun shone through here

232
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,873
and made a beam that came down
on the floor here...

233
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:27,876
and gave you the exact location
of the Well of the Souls.

234
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,378
Where the Ark of the Covenant
was kept, right?

235
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,714
Which is exactly what the Nazis
are looking for.

236
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,049
What does this Ark look like?

237
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,468
Uh...

238
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:38,845
INDY: There's a picture of it
right here.

239
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:45,351
That's it.

240
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,193
EATON: Good God.

241
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,820
Yes, that's just
what the Hebrews thought.

242
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,280
Uh...

243
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,824
now, what's that supposed to be
coming out of there?

244
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,576
INDY: Lightning...

245
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:03,620
fire...

246
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:05,872
power of God or something.

247
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:08,750
EATON: I'm beginning to understand

248
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,251
Hitler's interest in this.

249
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,711
BRODY: Oh, yes.

250
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:13,963
The Bible speaks of the
Ark leveling mountains,

251
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:17,550
and laying waste
to entire regions.

252
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:21,513
An army which carries
the Ark before it...

253
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,056
is invincible.

254
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:45,620
You did it, didn't you?

255
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,330
They want you to go for it.

(LAUGHING) Oh, Marcus!

257
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,627
They want you to get a hold of
the Ark before the Nazis do

258
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,879
and they're prepared
to pay handsomely for it.

259
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:56,130
And the museum?

260
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:57,465
The museum gets the Ark
when we're finished?

261
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:58,925
Oh, yes.

262
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,471
Oh...

263
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:05,598
The Ark of the Covenant.

264
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:08,351
Nothing else has come close.

265
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:09,644
That thing represents everything

266
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:13,147
we got into archeology
for in the first place.

270

271
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:24,784
I think I know where to start.

272
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:31,875

still be with him?
