After the funeral,
he gave it to the yard man.

I don't care.

161
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,106
Kids eat that kinda stuff in Korea.

162
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:17,069
In the stench and slime
of the feedlot...

163
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,822
he'd remember how
I'd looked the night before...

164
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,449
how I ran my hand through his hair
and traced the outline...

165
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,410
of his lips with my fingertip.

166
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,245
He wanted to die with me...

167
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:29,415
and I dreamed of being
lost forever in his arms.

168
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,379
The whole time,
the only thing I did wrong...

169
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:38,006
was throwing out my fish
when he got sick.

170
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:42,094
Later I got a new one, but this incident
kept on bothering me, and I turned to Kit.

171
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,096
Well, he was sick.

172
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:46,223
You couldn't do much about that.

173
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:49,017
I guess not.
So?

174
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:51,145
Well, it scared me.

175
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,689
Ah, don't worry about it.

176
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:56,859
I didn't mind tellin' Kit
about stuff like this...

177
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,403
'cause strange things
happened in his life too...

178
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,030
and some of the stuff
he did was strange.

179
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:05,159
For instance, he faked
his signature whenever he used it...

180
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:09,204
to keep other people from forging
important papers with his name.

181
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:16,295
And as he lay in bed
in the middle of the night...

182
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:20,799
he always heard a noise like somebody
was holding a seashell against his ear.

183
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:24,553
And sometimes he'd see me comin'
toward him in beautiful white robes...

184
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,473
and I'd put my cold hand
on his forehead.

185
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,567
Did it go the way
it's supposed to?

186
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,446
Yeah.

187
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,781
Is that all there is to it?

188
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:47,159
Yep.

189
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,165
Gosh, what was
everybody talkin' about?

190
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,668
Don't ask me.

191
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,715
Well, I'm glad it's over.

192
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,134
For a while I was afraid
I might die before it happened.

193
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,929
Had a wreck
or some deal like that.

194
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:10,057
Did you see where that tree
fell in the water?

195
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,975
Yeah.

196
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:15,521
River must've washed
the roots away.

197

You don't care
about anything I say, though.

198
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,777
You know what I think?
What?

199
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:24,696
We should crunch our hands
with this stone.

200
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,032
That way we'd never forget
what happened today.

201
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:30,369
But it would hurt.
Well, that's the point, stupid.

202
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,582
Don't call me stupid.

203
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,711
Okay, but I'm gonna keep it
for a souvenir.

204
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,800
Well, maybe one that's lighter.

205
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,523
[Holly Narrating] Kit made a solemn vow
he would always stand beside me...

206
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,692
and let nothin' come between us.

207
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,319
He wrote this out in writin',
put the paper in a box...

208
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,863
with some of our little tokens
and things...

209
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:11,326
then sent it off in a balloon
he'd found while on the garbage route.

210
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,913
His heart was filled with longin'
as he watched it drift off.

211
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,915
Something must've told him...

212
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,251
we'd never live these days
of happiness again...

213
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,587
that they were gone forever.

[No Audible Dialogue]

215
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:36,059
Then, sure enough, Dad found out
I'd been runnin' around behind his back.

216
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,770
He was madder
than I'd ever seen him.

217
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:42,274
As punishment for deceivin' him,
he went and shot my dog.

218
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:13,180
He made me take extra music lessons
every day after school...

219
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,766
and wait there
till he came to pick me up.

220
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:18,644
He said that if the piano
didn't keep me off the streets...

221
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,771
maybe the clarinet would.

222
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,365
Sure is pretty.

223
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:37,913
What did you come out here for?

224
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,169
I wasn't aware
there was any law against it.

225

Well, she means
an awful lot to me, sir.

You know, before I met her...

228
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,528
nobody could ask me
how I was doin' with my girl.

229
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:12,072
Matter of fact,
I didn't really have one.

on your Willys here?

Look, I got a lot of respect
for her too, sir.

234
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,064
That's about as good a one
as I know to tell you.

235
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,900
Well, it's not good enough.

236
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:54,948
What do you think would happen to her
if she stuck around with a guy like you?

237
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,201
She'd get along okay.

00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,746
And if she didn't, why...

239

she could just take off.

Just take right on off.
I wouldn't mind.

Kit made me get my books from school
so I wouldn't fall behind.

322
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,541
We'd be startin' a new life, he said,
and we'd have to change our names.

323
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,669
His would be James.
Mine would be Priscilla.

324
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,339
We'd hide out like spies
somewhere in the north...

325
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:43,674
where people didn't ask
a lot of questions.

326
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:50,056
I coulda snuck out the back
or hid in the boiler room, I suppose...

327
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,683
but I sensed
that my destiny now lay with Kit...

328
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,393
for better or for worse...

329
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,356
and that it was better to spend a week
with one who loved me for what I was...

330
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,775

Yeah, me too.

335
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,261
We hid out in the wilderness
down by a river...

336
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:30,304
in a grove of cottonwoods.

337
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,307
It being the flood season,
we built our house in the trees...

338
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:37,562
with tamarisk walls and willows
laid side by side to make a floor.

339
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:41,065
There wasn't a plant in the forest
that didn't come in handy.

340
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:05,673
We planned a huge network
of tunnels under the forest floor...

341
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,901
and our first order of business
every morning was to decide...

342
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,094
on a new password for the day.

343
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:14,015
Now and then we'd sneak out at night
and steal a chicken or a bunch of corn...

344
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:16,100
or some melons
from a melon patch.

345
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:21,355
Mostly, though, we just lay
on our backs and stared at the clouds.

346
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:24,233
And sometimes it was like bein'
in a big marble hall...

347
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:28,279
the way we talked in low voices
and heard the tiniest sound.

348
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:45,087
They hadn't found but one set of bones
in the ashes of the house...

349
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,298
so we knew they'd be lookin' for us.

350
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:49,383
Kit made sure we'd be prepared.

351
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:57,308
He gave me lectures
on how a gun works...

352
00:32:57,434 --> 00:33:00,436
how to take it apart
and put it back together again...

353
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:02,855
in case I had
to carry on without him.

354
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:06,108
He said that if the devil came at me,
I could shoot him with a gun.

355

One day I carried 30 pounds of wood

00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:42,554
They say Mexico's nice.

477
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:47,267
Kit, maybe I'd better get a shovel.

478
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,353
Okay.
I'll catch up with you.

479
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:51,188
Okay.

480
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:55,859
I found a lid.
It was layin' on the ground over there.

481
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:57,986
Put that down. It's dirty.

482
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:05,243
[Laughing]

483
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:13,210
[Holly] You missed!
You're a pissant.

484
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,883
Hey, you're throwing big ones!

485
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:22,219
Ho! Ho!

486
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:27,140
Cato?
The shovel's in the truck.

487
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:13,562
Kit never let on why he shot Cato.

488
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:16,940
He said that just talkin' about it
could bring us bad luck...

489
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:20,652
and that right now we needed
all the luck we could get.

490
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:25,449
[Kit]
You never told me about her.

491
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:49,931
Look at all this junk.

492
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:53,810
How's he doin'?

493
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,854
[Kit Exhales]

494
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,150
I got him in the stomach.

495
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:06,031
Is he upset?

496
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:08,575
He didn't say anything
to me about it.

497
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:28,178
Bunch of junk.

498
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:40,690
He stole that cage.

499
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:42,734
I saw him doin' it.

500
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:52,285
What you lookin' in there for? Can't
afford any of that. I'm just lookin'.

501
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:57,499
[Kit] Why don't you go in there
and keep him company for a while?

502
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:04,673
Hi.

503
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:06,841
[Weakly]
Hi.

504
00:48:06,968 --> 00:48:08,843
That your spider in there?

505
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:10,887
In that bottle?

506
00:48:11,973 --> 00:48:13,431
Yeah.

507
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,851
What do you feed him?

508
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:20,438
Flies.

509
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:24,192
Grasshoppers,
when I can catch 'em.

510
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,069
Does he bite?

511
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,489
He ain't never bit me.

512
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,908
[Car Horn Honking]

513
00:48:51,721 --> 00:48:53,346
Hi.

514
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,309
Hi.
Where's Cato?

515
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:59,352
Well, he's gone.

516
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:01,438
Gone?
Yeah.

517
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:03,732
Where?
He said not to tell.

518
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:05,567
Oh, yeah?

519
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:09,571
He said for you
to give us a lift into town.

520
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,283
You're the ones
with the Studebaker, aren't you?

521
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:18,121
I need to pick up something in the house.
I can't allow that.

522
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:22,542
What?
You go in there, I'll have to kill you.

523
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:25,503
What's going on?
Can't afford to take chances.

524
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,839
Come on outta there, young lady.

525
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:33,470
Let's us go out in this field here.
Come on.

526
00:49:33,638 --> 00:49:37,098
Ah, skip that. I'm gonna have
to keep my eye on you, though.

527
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,100
Okay.
You don't mind?

528
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:44,397
Hi.

529
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:49,069
What's gonna happen
to Jack and me?

530
00:49:49,195 --> 00:49:50,987
Have to ask Kit.

531
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:53,323
He says "frog," I jump.

532
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:54,908
Okay.

533
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:58,703
[Holly] What's your friend's name?
Jack.

534
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,580
Hmm.

535
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,248
You love him?

536
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:04,042
I don't know.

537
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:08,338
I gotta stick by Kit.
He feels trapped.

538
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:11,216
[Girl]
I can imagine.

539
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:14,344
[Holly] Well, I've felt that way.
Hadn't you?

540
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,602
Okay. Come on, you two.
Down in the cellar.

541
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:25,855
Go on.

542
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:30,735
Hey.

543
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:33,863
Do you promise to stay there for an hour?
Yeah.

544
00:50:34,907 --> 00:50:36,533
You expect me to believe that?

545
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:38,576
Yeah.

546
00:50:41,122 --> 00:50:43,623
I'm gonna shut the door.

547
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,966
Think I got 'em?
I don't know.

548
00:50:53,092 --> 00:50:55,301
Well, I'm not goin'
down there and look.

549
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:19,367
[Holly Narrating] Suddenly I was
thrown into a state of shock.

550
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:22,454
Kit was the most trigger-happy
person I'd ever met.

551
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:26,291
He claimed that as long as you're playing
for keeps and the law's coming at you...

552
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:29,085
it's considered okay
to shoot all witnesses.

553
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:33,173
You had to take the consequences,
though, and not whine about it later.

554
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,599
He'd never seemed
like a violent person before...

555
00:51:42,767 --> 00:51:45,769
except for once, when he said
he'd like to rub out a couple of guys...

556
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,979
whose names
he didn't care to mention.

557
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:50,482
It all goes to show
how you can know a person...

558
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:53,151
and not really know him
at the same time.

559
00:51:58,282 --> 00:51:59,991
We're in for it now...

560
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:02,202
if they catch us.

561
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:13,213
What did you put him in there for?

562
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:17,300
Just to keep him out of the sun.

563
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:53,169
At this moment,
I didn't feel shame or fear...

564
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:55,171
but just kind of blah...

565
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:59,467
like when you're sittin' there
and all the water's run out of the bathtub.

566
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:02,470
Are you tired?
Yeah.

567
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,472
Yeah, you look tired.

568
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:10,186
Listen, honey,
when all this is over...

569
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:12,730
I'm gonna sit down
and buy you a big, thick steak.

570
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:14,649
I don't want a steak.

571
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:18,653
Yeah, well, we'll see about that.

572
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:20,822
Hey, look.

573
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:23,283
They're probably gonna
blame that on me too.

574
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:25,034
Bastards.

575
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:29,414
The whole country
was out lookin' for us...

576
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,083
for who knew
where Kit would strike next?

577
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,043
Sidewalks cleared out.

578
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:37,005
Stores closed their doors
and drew the blinds.

579
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:38,631
Posses and vigilance committees...

580
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:41,509
were set up
from Texas to South Dakota.

581
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:44,721
Children rode back and forth
to school under heavy guard.

582
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:47,891
A famous detective
was brought in from Boston.

583
00:53:48,017 --> 00:53:50,894
He could find no clues.

584
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:56,691
People left their lights on
when they went to sleep.

585
00:53:56,817 --> 00:53:59,277
My clarinet teacher said
I probably wasn't responsible...

586
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:01,905
but others said I was.

587
00:54:02,031 --> 00:54:05,450
Then, on Thursday,
the governor of Oklahoma sent out...

588
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:09,579
the National Guard to stand watch
at the Federal Reserve Bank in Tulsa...

589
00:54:09,705 --> 00:54:12,665
when word got out
that Kit meant to rob it.

590
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:15,543
It was like the Russians had invaded.

591
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:35,063
We needed supplies, so we went to a
rich man's house. - [Doorbell Rings]

592
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:39,359
Kit figured it'd be safer and quicker
than shoppin' in the downtown.

593
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:41,653
A maid came to the door.
[Kit] Hi.

594
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:45,406
I'm here to check the meter.
My tools are in here.

595
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,118
Oh, this is Holly.
She's from Texas.

596
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:54,207
Later we found out she was deaf,
and we hadn't even known it.

597
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:57,043
Excuse me.

598
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:01,673
Hi.
Yes?

599
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:03,341
This your place?

600
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:06,386
Yes.
Sorry to barge in on you.

601
00:55:06,512 --> 00:55:09,138
Anyone else here besides you two?

602
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:10,556
No.

603
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:15,395
Good deal.

604
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:18,189
[Airplane Passes Overhead]

605
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:23,486
Oh, we're on the run...

606
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:25,446
and, uh...

607
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:27,657
we'd like to hang out here
for a while.

608
00:55:27,783 --> 00:55:30,618
Couple hours, maybe.
How'd that be?

609
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:32,996
Stay as long as you like.

610
00:55:33,122 --> 00:55:35,790
[High-pitched Tone Droning]

611
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:56,686
Next time I ring,
that means it's time to clear out.

612
00:56:42,483 --> 00:56:46,527
I left Kit in the parlor and went
for a stroll outside the house.

613
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:50,114
The day was quiet and serene,
but I didn't notice...

614
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,158
for I was deep in thought...

615
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:55,078
and not even thinkin'
about how to slip off.

616
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:09,759
The world was like a faraway planet
to which I could never return.

617
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:12,178
I thought,
what a fine place it was...

618
00:57:12,304 --> 00:57:15,515
full of things that people
can look into and enjoy.

619
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:19,852
Listen to your parents and teachers.

620
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:23,231
They got a line on most things,
so don't treat 'em like enemies.

621
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:26,442
There's always an outside chance
you can learn somethin'.

622
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:34,867
Try to keep an open mind.

623
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:38,121
Try to understand
the viewpoints of others.

624
00:57:38,247 --> 00:57:41,124
Consider the minority opinion...

625
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:45,336
but try to get along with the majority
of opinion once it's accepted.

626
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:54,971
Of course, Holly and I have had fun,
even if it has been rushed.

627
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:57,223
And, uh...

628
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:59,225
so far, we're doin' fine.

629
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:01,352
Hadn't got caught.

630
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,479
Excuse the grammar.

631
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:13,573
Hi.

632
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:16,075
Kit's downstairs
playin' with the Dictaphone.

633
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:21,539
Sometimes he acts like there's
somethin' wrong with his bean.

634
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,839
Hope nothin'
ever goes wrong with mine.

635
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:32,341
You think he's crazy, huh?

636
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:35,344
I don't know.
He's kinda odd.

637
00:58:43,604 --> 00:58:46,647
They claim I got him wrapped
around my little finger...

638
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,941
but I never told him
to shoot anybody.

639
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:55,865
Gosh, I like your house. Thank you.
[Doorbell Rings]

640
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,679
Hi.

641
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:21,599
Hi. Uh, Mr. Scarborough here?

642
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:23,059
Yeah.

643
00:59:23,227 --> 00:59:26,020
The thing about him,
he's down with the flu. He's sick.

644
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:27,772
Really?

645
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:29,232
Yeah.

646
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:31,692
I'd invite you inside,
except it's contagious.

647
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:34,904
Don't want to start an epidemic.
No, of course not.

648
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:37,448
Uh, it's only,
he called last night...

649
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,867
and asked if I could come by.

650
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,911
Well, he-he didn't have it last night.

651
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:50,878
What's that?

652
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:54,382
Well, I'd...
I'd like to leave a message...

653
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:56,175
if that's okay.

654
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:57,593
Sure.

655
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:01,514
[Writing]
[Paper Tears]

656
01:00:04,685 --> 01:00:08,312
Uh, you have to excuse me now.
I have to go back inside.

657
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,106
Bye.

658
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:26,580
Hey, Tex, we're outta here!

659
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:43,806
Hi. Whatcha doin'?

660
01:00:43,932 --> 01:00:47,310
Just thinking.
Yeah, good a way to kill time as any.

661
01:00:47,436 --> 01:00:48,811
She okay?

662
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:50,771
Yes.

663
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:52,815
Good.

664
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:55,276
Oh, uh, we're gonna take
the Cadillac for a while.

665
01:00:55,402 --> 01:00:57,570
How'd that be?
Fine.

666
01:00:57,696 --> 01:01:00,281
Don't worry.
I won't let her drive.

667
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:02,950
Oh, and, uh, here.

668
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:05,828
Here's a list of everything I borrowed.
Car's on there too.

669
01:01:05,954 --> 01:01:08,247
Okay, ma'am, let's go.
Out that way.

670
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:11,250
Go on.

671
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:15,755
You're my friend, aren't you?
Yes.

672
01:01:15,881 --> 01:01:17,798
Okay. No monkey business, now.

673
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:28,267
Groceries.

674
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:35,191
[Kit] That guy could sell that list
I gave him as a sample of my handwriting.

675
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,920
Hey, why are you always walkin'
ahead of me?

676
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:47,828
Well, why are you
always walkin' behind me?

677
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:51,332
Don't!

678
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:53,793
Anybody ever done that to you before?
No.

679
01:01:53,919 --> 01:01:55,419
Positive?

680
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:56,962
Yes.

681
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:01,384
Guess there's no way
I'll ever know for sure.

682
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:07,890
That guy must pay through the nose
to keep this place up.

683
01:02:08,016 --> 01:02:11,477
Lawn. Gas and electric.

684
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:13,145
Bagworms.

685
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:15,398
Plus the upkeep on the cars.

686
01:02:16,525 --> 01:02:18,692
Yeah, you get
a little money in your pocket...

687
01:02:18,819 --> 01:02:20,861
and you think
all your problems are solved.

688
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:23,572
Well, let me tell you,
they're not.

689
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:48,222
I'd like to get outta here.

690
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:51,434
As soon as I start the car.

691

[Engine Starts]

692
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,688
And fix my hat.

693
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:11,412
[Holly Narrating] Fearin' there'd be
roadblocks on the highways...

694
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:14,790
we took off across that region
known as the Great Plains.

695
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:17,918
Kit told me to enjoy
the scenery, and I did.

696
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:20,963
"Rumor:

697
01:03:21,089 --> 01:03:23,716
Pat Boone is seriously
considering giving up his career...

698
01:03:23,842 --> 01:03:27,678
so he can return to school full-time
and complete his education.

699
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:30,514
Fact: Pat has told intimates...

700
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,434
that so long as things
are going well for his career...

701
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,645
it's the education
that will have to take a backseat."

702
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:38,439
I don't blame him.

703

"Rumor: Frank Sinatra
and Rita Hayworth are in love.

Fact: True.
But not with each other."

705
01:03:50,911 --> 01:03:52,328
Yeah.

706
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:57,416
Through desert and mesa...

707
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:59,668
across the endless miles
of open range...

708
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:03,172
we made our headlong way,
steerin' by the telephone lines...

709
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,841
toward the mountains of Montana.

710
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:13,933
Kit would sometimes ram a cow
to save on ammo, and we'd cook it.

711
01:04:14,059 --> 01:04:17,269
Once we had to eat
a bunch of salt grass.

712
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:19,355
It tasted like cabbage.

713
01:04:24,736 --> 01:04:28,364
For gas we used the leakage
from the valves of the pipelines...

714
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:30,241
we found along the way.

715
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:34,119
"Drip gas" is what it's called
in that part of the country.

716
01:04:34,246 --> 01:04:37,039
Little by little,
we approached the border.

717
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:41,043
Kit was glad to leave South Dakota
behind and cursed its name.

718
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:44,213
He said that if the Communists
ever dropped the atomic bomb...

719
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:47,716
he wished they'd put it
right in the middle of Rapid City.

720
01:04:50,679 --> 01:04:52,805
That's Montana over there.

721
01:04:54,224 --> 01:04:56,183
[Kit]
I never been to Montana.

722
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:04,775
Acquaintance of mine's
been there, but I hadn't.

723
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:08,445
Never had any reason to.

724
01:05:11,283 --> 01:05:13,409
[Holly]
State bird's the meadowlark.

725
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:55,242
We lived in utter loneliness,
neither here nor there.

726
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:57,786
Kit said that "solitude"
was a better word...

727
01:05:57,912 --> 01:06:00,748
'cause it meant more exactly
what I wanted to say.

728
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:03,917
Whatever the expression,
I told him we couldn't go on...

729
01:06:04,044 --> 01:06:05,794
livin' this way.

730
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,756
Why not?

731
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:11,467
I mean, I'm havin' fun.
At least I'm not bitchin'.

732
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:15,137
Well, I feel kinda like
an animal livin' out here.

733
01:06:15,263 --> 01:06:17,806
There's no place to bathe and...

734
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:20,643
not any place to get
anything good to eat.

735
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:26,523
Well, I'll catch you a big trout
soon as we get to the mountains.

736
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:38,118
Everybody loves trout.

737
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:41,246
I'm serious.

738
01:06:54,094 --> 01:06:58,514
In the distance, I saw a train
making its way silently across the plain...

739
01:06:58,682 --> 01:07:02,101
like the caravan
in The Adventures of Marco Polo.

740
01:07:02,227 --> 01:07:05,104
It was our first taste
of civilization in weeks...

741
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:07,898
and I asked Kit
if we could have a closer look.

742
01:07:16,825 --> 01:07:18,784
Before we left, he shot a football...

743
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:21,495
that he considered excess baggage.

744
01:07:21,621 --> 01:07:24,790
Afterwards, he took and buried
some of our things in a bucket.

745
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:27,459
He said that nobody else
would know where we'd put 'em...

746
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:31,463
and that we'd come back someday
maybe and they'd still be sittin' here...

747
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:34,007
just the same,
but we'd be different.

748
01:07:34,134 --> 01:07:35,884
And if we never got back, well...

749
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,637
somebody might dig 'em up
a thousand years from now...

750
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:40,389
and wouldn't they wonder.

751
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:42,599
[Horn Blaring]

752
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:22,347
Maybe we shoulda tried to hop it.

753
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,560
It was goin' too fast.

754
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:30,481
Yeah, I coulda pulled the car
up on the tracks, slowed it down some.

755
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:32,483
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.

756
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:35,569
Well, maybe we oughta be stuck here.

757
01:08:35,695 --> 01:08:37,696
I'm not sayin' I know.

758
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,451
You're crazy.

759
01:08:53,213 --> 01:08:55,964
Kit took the bottle
and spun it around...

760
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:59,176
leaving to fate
which direction we should take.

761
01:09:04,182 --> 01:09:06,308
Well, maybe the slope here
is throwin' it off some.

762
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:10,020
We ought to find a more flat place.
How about over here?

763
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:16,610
Aw, forget it.
It doesn't matter.

764
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:18,946
If I'm worth a damn,
I'll pick the right direction.

765
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:21,782
If I'm not, well, I don't care.
See what I mean?

766
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:25,285
No. Well, I shouldn't
expect miracles, should I?

767
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:39,091
We'll keep on headin'
for that mountain.

768
01:09:39,217 --> 01:09:41,802
Just remember
I said it wasn't such a hot idea.

769
01:09:44,848 --> 01:09:46,640
We took off at sunset...

770
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:49,518
on a line toward
the mountains of Saskatchewan...

771
01:09:49,644 --> 01:09:53,647
for Kit, a magical land
beyond the reach of the law.

772
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:57,693
He needed me now more than ever,
but somethin' had come between us.

773
01:09:57,861 --> 01:10:00,529
I'd stopped
even payin' attention to him.

774
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:03,198
Instead I sat in the car
and read a map...

775
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:05,701
and spelled out
entire sentences with my tongue...

776
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:08,579
on the roof of my mouth,
where nobody could read 'em.

777
01:10:13,126 --> 01:10:15,419
That night we moved
closer to the border...

778
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:18,881
and clear across the prairie,
at the very edge of the horizon...

779
01:10:19,007 --> 01:10:22,801
we could make out the gas fires
at the refineries at Missoula...

780
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:25,929
while to the south we could see
the lights of Cheyenne...

781
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:29,391
a city bigger and grander
than I'd ever seen.

782
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:34,730
I felt all kind of things
lookin' at the lights of Cheyenne...

783
01:10:34,898 --> 01:10:37,691
but most important,
I made up my mind to never again...

784
01:10:37,817 --> 01:10:39,943
tag around with the hell-bent type...

785
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:42,529
no matter how in love
with him I was.

786
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:45,240
Finally, I found the strength
to tell Kit this.

787
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:47,451
I pointed out that
even if we got to the far north...

01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:50,895
[Man #4]
Joni James is from South Dakota.

947
01:25:51,021 --> 01:25:52,897
Yeah, I know.
She got outta there too.

948
01:25:53,023 --> 01:25:55,107
[Man #5]
Kit, who's your favorite singer?

949
01:25:55,234 --> 01:25:57,568
Eddie Fisher. Who's yours?
Eddie Fisher.

950
01:25:57,694 --> 01:26:01,364
Damn. You want a pen?
[Man #6] How old are you?

951
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:03,950
Don't you read the papers?
[Men Chuckling]

952
01:26:04,076 --> 01:26:05,952
You ever been married?
No, I haven't.

953
01:26:06,078 --> 01:26:08,412
[Man #7] Hey, Kit?
Yeah?

954
01:26:08,539 --> 01:26:10,498
You afraid of death?

955
01:26:10,624 --> 01:26:12,375
[Kit]
I haven't thought about it much.

956
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:15,920
[Man, Indistinct]
[Kit] Say again?

957
01:26:16,046 --> 01:26:18,339
[Indistinct]
Yep.

958
01:26:21,343 --> 01:26:25,638
Hey, Tom, I don't mean to tell you how to run
your show here, but these cuffs are pinchin' some.

959
01:26:25,764 --> 01:26:27,348
What do you say now?

960
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:30,393
I need to get your signature
on some paperwork here, Kit.

961
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:33,980
Well, I'll have to read it first.
Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?

962
01:26:34,106 --> 01:26:35,481
Sure thing.

963
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:37,233
Come on.

964
01:26:38,318 --> 01:26:40,987
You boys keep out of trouble.
[Man] Don't worry about us.

965
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:44,031
[Tom] Holly's over here, Kit,
if you want to see her.

966
01:26:44,157 --> 01:26:45,992
Sure.

967
01:26:50,789 --> 01:26:55,084
[Tom] I give him the papers to sign.
I'm gonna get him a Coke.

968
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:57,879
You want to give me
a little slack there?

969
01:27:03,010 --> 01:27:04,760
Hi.

970
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:09,056
[Soldier]
Double-time, push!

971
01:27:12,185 --> 01:27:15,146
Don't worry, now.
I'm gonna get you off these charges.

972
01:27:15,272 --> 01:27:17,541
There's a whole lot of other boys
out there waitin' for you...

973
01:27:17,566 --> 01:27:19,400
and you're gonna have a lot of fun.

974
01:27:25,782 --> 01:27:27,742
Boy, we rang the bell, didn't we?

975
01:27:30,579 --> 01:27:32,538
I'll say this, though:

976
01:27:33,957 --> 01:27:36,334
That guy with the deaf maid?

977
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:38,419
He's just lucky he's not dead too.

978
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:48,596
'Course, uh,
too bad about your dad.

979
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:52,642
Yeah.

980
01:27:52,768 --> 01:27:55,561
We're gonna have to sit down
and talk about that sometime.

981
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:51,701
There you go, Tom.

982
01:28:52,786 --> 01:28:55,579
Thank you.
Thank you very much, Chief Sims.

983
01:28:56,707 --> 01:28:59,226
Sorry if I caused you any inconvenience.
You didn't cause me any trouble.

984
01:28:59,251 --> 01:29:01,836
Thanks anyway.

985
01:29:01,962 --> 01:29:03,671
Well...

986
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:07,049
Kit.
Tom.

987
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:08,551
Good luck.
Thank you.

988
01:29:08,677 --> 01:29:10,469
I mean it.
I know. Good luck to you too.

989
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:13,556
Now we go.
Okay. Thank you.

990
01:29:14,683 --> 01:29:16,517
Come on, Red.

991
01:29:34,745 --> 01:29:37,371
Kit and I were taken back
to South Dakota.

992
01:29:37,497 --> 01:29:40,041
They kept him in solitary,
so he didn't have a chance...

993
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:41,888
to get acquainted
with the other inmates...

994
01:29:41,918 --> 01:29:45,671
though he was sure they'd like him,
especially the murderers.

995
01:29:45,797 --> 01:29:50,134
Myself, I got off with probation
and a lot of nasty looks.

996
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:53,345
Later I married the son
of the lawyer who defended me.

997
01:29:55,557 --> 01:29:59,477
Kit went to sleep in the courtroom
while his confession was bein' read...

998
01:29:59,603 --> 01:30:02,313
and he was sentenced
to die in the electric chair.

999
01:30:02,439 --> 01:30:05,399
On a warm spring night,
six months later...

1000
01:30:05,525 --> 01:30:09,111
after donatin' his body
to science, he did.

1001
01:30:13,325 --> 01:30:17,078
Sir, where'd you get that hat?

1002
01:30:17,204 --> 01:30:18,913
State.

1003
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:22,583
Boy, I'd like
to buy me one of them.

1004
01:30:22,709 --> 01:30:26,420
[Soft Chuckle]
You're quite an individual, Kit.

1005
01:30:30,175 --> 01:30:33,552
Think they'll take that
into consideration?
