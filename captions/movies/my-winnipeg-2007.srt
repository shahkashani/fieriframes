1
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:25,585
<i>Um, OK,
"I wasn't born yesterday, dearie."</i>

2
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,921
I wasn't born yesterday, dearie.

3
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:29,923
<i>"I know all about fur
and all about blood."</i>

4
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:32,675
I know all about fur
and all about blood.

5
00:00:32,715 --> 00:00:36,304
<i>- "Where did it happen?"</i>
- Where did it happen? In the backseat?

6
00:00:36,344 --> 00:00:39,349
<i>- Where did what happen?</i>
- The real party.

7
00:00:39,389 --> 00:00:43,520
<i>We'll just do that over again.
"The real party. Did he pin you down?"</i>

8
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,398
- The real party. Did he pin you down?
<i>- "Or did you just lie back..."</i>

9
00:00:47,438 --> 00:00:51,236
Or did you just lie back
and let nature take its course?

10
00:00:51,276 --> 00:00:54,030
<i>"Or did you just lie back
and let nature take its course?"</i>

11
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,700
Or did you just lie back
and let nature take its course?

12
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,454
<i>"Was it a boy on the track team
or the man with the tire iron?"</i>

13
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:06,042
Was it the boy on the track team
or the man with the tire iron?

14
00:01:06,082 --> 00:01:09,671
<i>OK, a little angrier.
"Was it a boy on the track team?"</i>

15
00:01:09,711 --> 00:01:13,841
Was it a boy on the track team
or the man with the tire iron?

16
00:01:13,881 --> 00:01:16,481
<i>- Excellent. Cut.
- Cut it.</i>

17
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,432
* Winnipeg, Winnipeg

18
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,270
* Wonderful Winnipeg

19
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:34,157
* Hail my town, hail my home

20
00:01:35,737 --> 00:01:39,538
* The world that moves
round and round.

21
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,450
* Winnipeg, Winnipeg

22
00:01:45,413 --> 00:01:47,413
* Wonderful Winnipeg

23
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,875
* Where I belong

24
00:01:51,627 --> 00:01:55,827
* And joys redound
in one long, happy song.

25
00:01:57,967 --> 00:02:01,367
* Here are friends
and kindly faces

26
00:02:03,055 --> 00:02:05,455
* Folks I'm glad to know

27
00:02:07,268 --> 00:02:09,968
* Memories, familiar places

28
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:14,131
* To cherish with a glow

29
00:02:16,486 --> 00:02:18,486
* Winnipeg, Winnipeg

30
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,990
* Wonderful Winnipeg

31
00:02:25,536 --> 00:02:28,737
* It's no Eden
that you would see

32
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:32,715
* Yet it's home sweet home to me.

33
00:02:57,109 --> 00:02:59,109
All aboard!

34
00:03:37,316 --> 00:03:39,316
Winnipeg.

35
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,610
Winnipeg.

36
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,700
Winnipeg.

37
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,100
Snowy, sleepwalking Winnipeg.

38
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,870
My home for my entire life.

39
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:04,049
My entire life.

40
00:04:06,804 --> 00:04:08,804
I must leave it.

41
00:04:09,014 --> 00:04:11,014
I must leave it.

42
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,860
I must leave it now.

43
00:04:16,605 --> 00:04:19,505
But how to escape one's city?

44
00:04:19,775 --> 00:04:24,407
How to wake oneself enough
for the frightening task...

45
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,347
of how to find one's way out?

46
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:33,874
The greatest urban train yard
in the world.

47
00:04:33,914 --> 00:04:36,014
Arteries. Iron veins.

48
00:04:36,917 --> 00:04:38,917
Ways out.

49
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,257
The dream train.

50
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:43,297
Chugging, dreaming.

51
00:04:45,968 --> 00:04:50,168
Sleep-chugging,
out of the lap of the city.

52
00:04:52,016 --> 00:04:55,354
Out of the lap described
by the Forks,

53
00:04:55,394 --> 00:04:58,194
of the Red, the Assiniboine.

54
00:04:59,148 --> 00:05:01,148
The Forks,

55
00:05:01,984 --> 00:05:04,384
Assiniboine and the Red.

56
00:05:05,362 --> 00:05:13,455
The rivers that forced animals and hunters
alike onto the same waterside pathways.

57
00:05:13,495 --> 00:05:15,495
The Forks, the lap.

58
00:05:16,874 --> 00:05:18,874
The Forks, the lap.

59
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:22,711
The Forks, the lap.

60
00:05:24,506 --> 00:05:26,506
The Forks, the lap.

61
00:05:30,215 --> 00:05:32,975
The reason we are here, right here,

62
00:05:33,015 --> 00:05:35,227
in the centre of the continent,

63
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:39,167
the heart of the heart
of the continent.

64
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,810
The hunted lap. The woolly lap.
The lap of my mother.

65
00:05:53,285 --> 00:05:56,985
Arteries.
The Forks beneath the Forks.

66
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:05,466
An old tale from the first nations
has it there are subterranean Forks -

67
00:06:05,506 --> 00:06:11,513
two secret rivers meeting,
directly beneath the Assiniboine and Red,

68
00:06:11,553 --> 00:06:18,054
this double pairing of rivers being
extra supernaturally powerful.

69
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:24,912
The animals, the hunters,
the boatways, water and rails -

70
00:06:25,067 --> 00:06:28,367
these are the reasons we're here.

71
00:06:33,158 --> 00:06:37,790
Pulling out of the station.
Pulling out of the station.

72
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,376
What if I had already left
decades ago?

73
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,416
What if? What if?

74
00:06:44,586 --> 00:06:47,186
Winnipeg... always winter.

75
00:06:48,257 --> 00:06:50,257
Always winter.

76
00:06:51,593 --> 00:06:53,593
Always sleepy.

77
00:06:55,931 --> 00:06:57,931
Winnipeg...

78
00:06:59,017 --> 00:07:01,117
Winnipeg... Winnipeg.

79
00:07:05,816 --> 00:07:08,237
The train tracks cross
the streetcar tracks

80
00:07:08,277 --> 00:07:12,866
and in turn cross the streets
and the alleyways...

81
00:07:12,906 --> 00:07:18,038
everything beneath thin layers
of time, asphalt and snow.

82
00:07:18,078 --> 00:07:21,078
Are these arteries still here?

83
00:07:21,456 --> 00:07:26,004
Are they dug out every night
and reburied every dawn?

84
00:07:26,044 --> 00:07:29,800
We Winnipeggers are so stupefied
with nostalgia,

85
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,135
we're actually never quite sure.

86
00:07:32,175 --> 00:07:34,846
I never really know anything
for sure,

87
00:07:34,886 --> 00:07:38,850
except that after a lifetime of trying
and many botched attempts,

88
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:42,790
this time I'm leaving for good...
again!

89
00:07:45,105 --> 00:07:48,402
Back in Winnipeg's earliest years,
the Canadian Pacific Railway

90
00:07:48,442 --> 00:07:50,737
used to sponsor
an annual treasure hunt.

91
00:07:50,777 --> 00:07:53,490
This contest required
our citizens to wander the city

92
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:56,618
in a day-long combing
of our streets and neighbourhoods.

93
00:07:56,658 --> 00:07:59,746
First prize was a one-way ticket
on the next train out of town,

94
00:07:59,786 --> 00:08:02,624
the idea being that once someone
had spent a full day

95
00:08:02,664 --> 00:08:06,628
looking this closely at his own hometown,
he would never want to leave.

96
00:08:06,668 --> 00:08:09,798
That the real treasure
was right here all along.

97
00:08:09,838 --> 00:08:14,386
And you know what? Not one treasure-hunt
winner ever got on that train and left.

98
00:08:14,426 --> 00:08:17,026
Not one, not in 100 years.

99
00:08:20,015 --> 00:08:23,812
Well, I don't need a treasure hunt.
I've got my own ticket.

100
00:08:23,852 --> 00:08:25,981
I just have to make my way
through town,

101
00:08:26,021 --> 00:08:29,526
through everything
I've ever seen and lived...

102
00:08:29,566 --> 00:08:33,166
everything I've loved and forgotten.

103
00:08:34,404 --> 00:08:37,367
Through the thick, furry frost
and out to the city limits,

104
00:08:37,407 --> 00:08:40,620
then I'm on my way, out of here...

105
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:44,833
out from the heart
of the heart of the continent,

106
00:08:44,873 --> 00:08:47,873
the woolly, furry, frosty lap.

107
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:53,842
The Forks, the animals, hunters,
boatways, trains and Mother.

108
00:08:53,882 --> 00:08:56,511
These are the reasons we're here.

109
00:08:56,551 --> 00:09:01,516
These are these reasons we've stayed.
These are the reasons I'm leaving.

110
00:09:01,556 --> 00:09:06,730
These are the very things
that are going to help me get out of here.

111
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,570
The Forks, the lap, the fur.

112
00:09:10,732 --> 00:09:13,532
The Forks, the lap, the fur.

113
00:09:17,739 --> 00:09:23,205
Mother appears occasionally on the train
to check on the passengers.

114
00:09:23,245 --> 00:09:25,245
My mother...

115
00:09:26,164 --> 00:09:30,865
a force as strong
as all the trains in Manitoba.

116
00:09:32,921 --> 00:09:36,217
As perennial as the winter,
as ancient as the bison,

117
00:09:36,257 --> 00:09:39,512
as supernatural
as the Forks itself.

118
00:09:39,552 --> 00:09:42,052
Her lap, a magnetic pole,

119
00:09:43,264 --> 00:09:47,665
a direction from which I can't turn
for long.

120
00:09:49,187 --> 00:09:52,233
It must be the sleepiness
which keeps Winnipeggers here.

121
00:09:52,273 --> 00:09:55,779
If only I can stay awake, pay attention
to where I'm going, where I've been,

122
00:09:55,819 --> 00:09:57,819
and get out of here.

123
00:09:58,655 --> 00:10:02,055
Stay awake.
Stay awake. Stay awake.

124
00:10:16,881 --> 00:10:19,081
We sleep as we walk...

125
00:10:21,636 --> 00:10:23,636
...walk as we dream.

126
00:10:26,141 --> 00:10:32,190
Winnipeg has ten times the sleepwalking
rate of any other city in the world.

127
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:37,737
And because we dream of where we walk
and walk to where we dream,

128
00:10:37,777 --> 00:10:39,877
we are always lost...

129
00:10:41,156 --> 00:10:43,156
befuddled.

130
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:56,464
Asleep on foot, the Winnipegger
is a citizen of the night -

131
00:10:56,504 --> 00:10:58,504
the Winnipeg night.

132
00:10:59,841 --> 00:11:01,841
Why is this so?

133
00:11:03,469 --> 00:11:05,569
Why are we so sleepy?

134
00:11:06,014 --> 00:11:09,214
Why can't we just open our eyes?

135
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:12,313
Is it the mystically paired
river Forks?

136
00:11:12,353 --> 00:11:15,316
The bio magnetic influence
of our bison?

137
00:11:15,356 --> 00:11:19,320
The powerful northern lights?
We don't know.

138
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,360
We sleep.

139
00:11:24,532 --> 00:11:26,532
We sleepwalk.

140
00:11:27,222 --> 00:11:29,222
We sleepwalk.

141
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:37,509
We show up on old doorsteps,

142
00:11:38,046 --> 00:11:43,246
old homes - our old homes,
those of our sweethearts -

143
00:11:44,636 --> 00:11:50,476
and we are allowed by civic law to carry
the keys of these old, dreamy domiciles,

144
00:11:50,516 --> 00:11:53,617
of these old, dreamy addresses.

145
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:59,819
And those that live at the old homes

146
00:11:59,859 --> 00:12:03,859
must always take in
a lost sleepwalker...

147
00:12:04,072 --> 00:12:08,473
must let the confused one
stay till he wakes.

148
00:12:08,576 --> 00:12:11,176
In Winnipeg, it's the law.

149
00:12:13,831 --> 00:12:16,531
These old dreamy addresses.

150
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,300
Keys... keys.

151
00:12:26,094 --> 00:12:28,094
Winnipeg.

152
00:12:33,226 --> 00:12:35,226
Home.

153
00:12:40,942 --> 00:12:45,531
Unlike other sleepwalkers who carry
with themselves great balls of keys,

154
00:12:45,571 --> 00:12:48,771
keys to all their old addresses,

155
00:12:48,908 --> 00:12:52,413
I keep just the one key with me
at all times,

156
00:12:52,453 --> 00:12:54,653
the key to 800 Ellice.

157
00:12:58,292 --> 00:13:00,292
Home.

158
00:13:05,925 --> 00:13:07,925
Dreams...

159
00:13:09,303 --> 00:13:11,303
dreaming...

160
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,639
dreaming...

161
00:13:16,477 --> 00:13:18,773
Every night,
I have the same happy dream,

162
00:13:18,813 --> 00:13:22,213
that I'm back
in my childhood home.

163
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:28,616
It was the biggest house
in the neighbourhood, also the strangest.

164
00:13:28,656 --> 00:13:31,577
I was proud of this strangeness -
and ashamed, too,

165
00:13:31,617 --> 00:13:34,205
depending on who saw me
enter its front door,

166
00:13:34,245 --> 00:13:36,749
for it was actually
three structures in one -

167
00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:42,255
most embarrassingly, a beauty salon
run by my mom and my Aunt Lil...

168
00:13:42,295 --> 00:13:48,886
a sprawling seven-room suite in back
for my aunt and grandmother...

169
00:13:48,926 --> 00:13:52,098
and up top, a big baby boomer
bedroom cluster

170
00:13:52,138 --> 00:13:54,475
for my mom, dad, three siblings -

171
00:13:54,515 --> 00:13:58,515
Ross, Cam, Janet
and Toby, our Chihuahua,

172
00:14:00,229 --> 00:14:03,730
our long, long, long-dead
Chihuahua.

173
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
A big cube of home.

174
00:14:10,698 --> 00:14:12,898
A chunk of happy home.

175
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:19,166
I've often wondered what effect
growing up in a hair salon had on me.

176
00:14:19,206 --> 00:14:22,406
Designed by my mother in 1940...

177
00:14:25,713 --> 00:14:29,009
I loved the noises, the shop
always a-whir with gossip,

178
00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:31,595
laughter, buzzing, snipping,

179
00:14:31,635 --> 00:14:36,642
the clatter of trays dropped on the floor,
door chimes, the phone always ringing.

180
00:14:36,682 --> 00:14:41,083
Shrieks. Shrieks over the roar
of the dryers.

181
00:14:41,562 --> 00:14:44,191
The air always acrid
with lotions,

182
00:14:44,231 --> 00:14:45,985
or fuzzy with sprays -

183
00:14:46,025 --> 00:14:49,826
cloudy, cloudy, cloudy
with hairsprays.

184
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:52,321
Helmets. Helmets.

185
00:14:53,908 --> 00:14:57,621
Cutting of hair.
The torturing of hair.

186
00:14:57,661 --> 00:15:01,261
Helmets. The drying of hair.
Helmets.

187
00:15:02,082 --> 00:15:04,082
Sweepings of hair.

188
00:15:04,126 --> 00:15:10,176
The hair chute for the sweepings,
leading down into the basement.

189
00:15:10,216 --> 00:15:13,095
The air vent leading upstairs,

190
00:15:13,135 --> 00:15:16,974
right into my bedroom,
bringing me every word of conversation

191
00:15:17,014 --> 00:15:20,314
that roiled
out of that gynocracy.

192
00:15:21,185 --> 00:15:23,230
At school, I reeked
of hair product -

193
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:26,233
pomades for the elderly,
lotions for the elderly.

194
00:15:26,273 --> 00:15:28,903
I smelled of corn plasters
and Barbicide,

195
00:15:28,943 --> 00:15:32,740
of girdles and talc,
fur coats and purses,

196
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,980
the insides of purses,

197
00:15:35,282 --> 00:15:38,370
the smells of female vanity
and desperation.

198
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:42,811
I grew under their influences
into what I am.

199
00:15:47,044 --> 00:15:49,944
I will always love this shop.

200
00:15:53,884 --> 00:15:56,284
White... block... house.

201
00:15:58,305 --> 00:16:00,705
White... block... house.

202
00:16:05,979 --> 00:16:09,479
I can't stop dreaming of this home.

203
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:13,150
It's changed since we sold it.

204
00:16:14,488 --> 00:16:17,589
It keeps changing in my dreams.

205
00:16:19,326 --> 00:16:22,827
New shapes -
similar, but confusing.

206
00:16:23,664 --> 00:16:27,961
All the other addresses that appear
where 800 Ellice should be...

207
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:30,601
smaller, longer, darker...

208
00:16:31,213 --> 00:16:33,513
lower, older, bigger...

209
00:16:37,261 --> 00:16:39,561
but never just my home.

210
00:16:44,935 --> 00:16:46,935
Home. Home.

211
00:16:48,856 --> 00:16:52,957
The dreams are sweet
back home, back home.

212
00:16:53,152 --> 00:16:57,553
But the waking is bitter...
bitter... bitter.

213
00:17:02,202 --> 00:17:04,202
Bitterness.

214
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:09,086
Bitterness, sweet as the cold
of our winters.

215
00:17:09,126 --> 00:17:12,506
We're the coldest city in the world.

216
00:17:12,546 --> 00:17:17,511
What enchantments this cold offers up
to the person with the right attitude!

217
00:17:17,551 --> 00:17:20,013
What exuberant lungfuls
of fresh air the city has

218
00:17:20,053 --> 00:17:24,518
for those who want to scoop it up
in their mouths!

219
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:27,354
Happiness,
dazzling outdoor happiness

220
00:17:27,394 --> 00:17:30,440
for anyone who cares to put on
a pair of mitts and embrace it,

221
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,780
squeeze every last snowflake
of joy from it.

222
00:17:37,154 --> 00:17:42,455
Back in 1906, we Winnipeggers
built our own Happyland.

223
00:17:45,245 --> 00:17:48,845
Our own Luna Park,
our own Dreamland.

224
00:17:49,249 --> 00:17:53,380
You'd never know it, but between these
West End streets of Aubrey and Dominion,

225
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,632
between Portage Avenue
and the Assiniboine,

226
00:17:55,672 --> 00:17:59,553
sprawled the immense permanent
playground, teeming with oddity.

227
00:17:59,593 --> 00:18:02,293
Wind-chilled rollercoasters

228
00:18:02,512 --> 00:18:07,185
and Ferris wheels
enveloped themselves in frost half the year,

229
00:18:07,225 --> 00:18:11,026
a Happyland for us
wintry Winnipeggers.

230
00:18:12,272 --> 00:18:15,272
Happyland... keeping us happy.

231
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:21,742
All a dream, all a dream.

232
00:18:21,782 --> 00:18:25,454
I need to wake up,
keep my eyes open somehow.

233
00:18:25,494 --> 00:18:29,708
I need to get out of here.
I need to get out of here.

234
00:18:29,748 --> 00:18:31,543
What if?

235
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,755
What if I film my way out of here?

236
00:18:34,795 --> 00:18:37,896
It's time for extreme measures.

237
00:18:39,382 --> 00:18:44,482
I need to make my own Happyland,
back at 800 Ellice.

238
00:18:50,977 --> 00:18:55,442
In commemoration of what would be
my parents' 65th wedding anniversary,

239
00:18:55,482 --> 00:18:59,613
I sublet for one month
the house in which I grew up.

240
00:18:59,653 --> 00:19:03,200
Mother, as always,
is game for anything.

241
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,078
Eager is she to dip into
the past of her home.

242
00:19:07,118 --> 00:19:11,618
I hire movers.
Tax deduction. I'm a filmmaker.

243
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:16,046
Only here can I properly
recreate the archetypal episodes

244
00:19:16,086 --> 00:19:17,881
from my family history.

245
00:19:17,921 --> 00:19:20,634
Only here can I isolate
the essence

246
00:19:20,674 --> 00:19:25,305
of what in this dynamic
is keeping me in Winnipeg.

247
00:19:25,345 --> 00:19:29,684
And perhaps, once this isolation
through filmed reenactment is complete,

248
00:19:29,724 --> 00:19:32,979
I can free myself from
the heinous power of family and city

249
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:35,819
and escape once and for all.

250
00:19:36,731 --> 00:19:39,986
In addition to shooting everything,
I keep a meticulous logbook

251
00:19:40,026 --> 00:19:43,365
charting this strange plunge
back in time.

252
00:19:43,405 --> 00:19:47,827
It's 1963-ish, a time I believe
most likely to conceal

253
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:53,667
the key to all the memories and feelings
that enervate me to this day.

254
00:19:53,707 --> 00:19:57,921
In my old living room,
Mother puts everything back just as it was.

255
00:19:57,961 --> 00:20:00,382
The old black-and-white TV
in one corner,

256
00:20:00,422 --> 00:20:04,223
the planters,
crummy sofa, comfy chair.

257
00:20:04,884 --> 00:20:07,889
For one month,
I get to sleep in my old bedroom,

258
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:12,018
the letters Y-U-G still carved
dyslexically upon its door

259
00:20:12,058 --> 00:20:14,958
so Santa will know I'm there.

260
00:20:15,395 --> 00:20:19,496
Everything is the same
as in my childhood.

261
00:20:19,941 --> 00:20:22,195
The scope of this experiment
excludes my father.

262
00:20:22,235 --> 00:20:24,280
I decide to keep him
out of the formula.

263
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,242
My mother, missing him terribly
since his death 30 years ago,

264
00:20:27,282 --> 00:20:29,327
lobbies strongly for his inclusion.

265
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:31,371
We settle on a compromise
and pretend

266
00:20:31,411 --> 00:20:33,873
we've had him exhumed
and reburied in the living room,

267
00:20:33,913 --> 00:20:36,584
beneath a mound of earth
concealed by the area rug.

268
00:20:36,624 --> 00:20:42,024
This seems to buy her off -
for the time being, anyway.

269
00:20:44,257 --> 00:20:50,014
For the reenactments which concern me,
I hire actors to play my brothers and sister.

270
00:20:50,054 --> 00:20:52,058
Finding these actors isn't hard.

271
00:20:52,098 --> 00:20:55,562
In fact, I'm able to get substitutes
that bear uncanny resemblances

272
00:20:55,602 --> 00:20:58,102
to the vintage originals.

273
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:02,944
My sister Janet, who in 1967
was a Pan Am Games gold medallist

274
00:21:02,984 --> 00:21:06,656
and is now a member of the
Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame.

275
00:21:06,696 --> 00:21:11,494
My brother Cameron,
who died in 1963 at the age of 16.

276
00:21:11,534 --> 00:21:15,248
My brother Ross,
always big man on campus.

277
00:21:15,288 --> 00:21:19,627
My dog Toby - lived to be 11,
never successfully house-trained -

278
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:22,881
to be played by
my girlfriend's dog, Spanky.

279
00:21:22,921 --> 00:21:26,259
Actors for them all,
except Mother.

280
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:28,845
At the last second,
the woman who has sublet this place

281
00:21:28,885 --> 00:21:31,181
decides she doesn't want to leave.

282
00:21:31,221 --> 00:21:33,433
She put a bit of a damper
on things.

283
00:21:33,473 --> 00:21:35,685
...all of our old things...

284
00:21:35,725 --> 00:21:38,354
Experiment
seems to be going well.

285
00:21:38,394 --> 00:21:41,232
We start with something easy
the first few hours, and everyone -

286
00:21:41,272 --> 00:21:44,944
the hired actors, Mother, the strange lady
who won't leave her house -

287
00:21:44,984 --> 00:21:47,614
are all comfortable enough
to gather around the TV

288
00:21:47,654 --> 00:21:51,409
and watch the only television drama
ever produced in Winnipeg.

289
00:21:51,449 --> 00:21:53,786
Don't try to sweet-talk me.

290
00:21:53,826 --> 00:21:57,927
It's talk. talk. talk.
All you do is talk.

291
00:21:58,289 --> 00:22:00,627
I'm going to do it
for real this time!

292
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:03,630
It was a daily TV drama
called "LedgeMan",

293
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:07,300
and my mother's been the female lead
in this show since 1956.

294
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:10,887
<i>Don't think they don't know
that you're a coward and a baby</i>

295
00:22:10,927 --> 00:22:14,827
<i>who has to get his own way
all the time.</i>

296
00:22:16,015 --> 00:22:20,855
<i>You're looking pretty cocky
now that you've given me shingles</i>

297
00:22:20,895 --> 00:22:26,496
<i>and made me lick dirt for
all those reporters down there.</i>

298
00:22:27,026 --> 00:22:29,822
Every day,
the show runs at noon.

299
00:22:29,862 --> 00:22:33,743
The same oversensitive man
takes something said the wrong way,

300
00:22:33,783 --> 00:22:36,120
climbs out on a window ledge
and threatens to jump.

301
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,831
- I'm gonna jump.
- And every day, his mother appears

302
00:22:38,871 --> 00:22:42,335
at the nearest window and tells him
to remember all the reasons for living.

303
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:46,214
<i>In spite of what you think. you
have never been a disappointment to me.</i>

304
00:22:46,254 --> 00:22:47,799
Don't make me do it.

305
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:51,177
<i>Why. when you were
a child model for Hudson Bay.</i>

306
00:22:51,217 --> 00:22:55,264
<i>I was so full of pride
I could hardly breathe.</i>

307
00:22:55,304 --> 00:23:00,520
<i>That little checked suit.
and not a hair out of place.</i>

308
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,814
Don't try to sweet-talk me!

309
00:23:02,854 --> 00:23:06,275
- By the end of each episode...
- I love you. Mom.

310
00:23:06,315 --> 00:23:10,113
...the son is convinced
to come in to safety.

311
00:23:10,153 --> 00:23:12,365
But the next day,
he is back out there again.

312
00:23:12,405 --> 00:23:14,534
Next... on "LedgeMan"...

313
00:23:14,574 --> 00:23:17,374
Suicide on Portage and Main!

314
00:23:21,747 --> 00:23:27,255
Mother's never missed a day in
the 50 years the show has been broadcast.

315
00:23:27,295 --> 00:23:29,882
Surprisingly, after half a century
of acting on TV,

316
00:23:29,922 --> 00:23:32,385
Mother is resistant to playing
the role of herself

317
00:23:32,425 --> 00:23:34,887
in this exciting experiment of mine,

318
00:23:34,927 --> 00:23:37,723
which could actually not just unlock
the secrets of a family,

319
00:23:37,763 --> 00:23:40,518
- but create a new genre of film.
<i>- Six alpha, take one.</i>

320
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:44,230
Can't I have the lines?
It would be so much better for her.

321
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:47,900
She's always been stubbornly
resistant to my most important ideas.

322
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,654
Just to show me who's boss, she'll
forget a line or transpose its syllables,

323
00:23:51,694 --> 00:23:53,573
anything to destroy a take.

324
00:23:53,613 --> 00:23:58,744
OK, with the car? Oh, I'm sorry.
There's no such thing as an accident!

325
00:23:58,784 --> 00:24:03,207
<i>- Let's just try it again.</i>
- Yeah, I just went a little off there.

326
00:24:03,247 --> 00:24:06,210
I just know
she's doing it to be difficult.

327
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:10,089
Sorry, I'm getting further
and further away from the lines.

328
00:24:10,129 --> 00:24:13,593
We fight on the set, but her
refusal to acknowledge the real past

329
00:24:13,633 --> 00:24:16,554
becomes scientifically significant,
I think.

330
00:24:16,594 --> 00:24:18,594
Very telling.

331
00:24:18,888 --> 00:24:21,892
- Uh, may I hear that again?
<i>- Sure."No innocent..."</i>

332
00:24:21,932 --> 00:24:27,732
This is gonna be a good month,
the month of my great escape.

333
00:24:27,772 --> 00:24:29,872
<i>That's good, and cut!</i>

334
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:34,405
It's a singular chance,
this month.

335
00:24:34,445 --> 00:24:38,246
Who gets to vivisect
his own childhood?

336
00:24:38,949 --> 00:24:43,622
The first full scene up is
the straightening of the hall runner,

337
00:24:43,662 --> 00:24:47,043
something we did every exasperating day
of my childhood.

338
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:49,754
An unbelievable source of frustration
for everyone,

339
00:24:49,794 --> 00:24:52,673
for the rug could actually
never be straightened out,

340
00:24:52,713 --> 00:24:55,009
no matter how much
anyone pulled from either end.

341
00:24:55,049 --> 00:24:58,304
And Mother always nagged
from the sidelines.

342
00:24:58,344 --> 00:25:01,932
The actors put in a limp performance,
displaying little affect,

343
00:25:01,972 --> 00:25:05,061
and it's me behind the camera
who gets frustrated instead of them.

344
00:25:05,101 --> 00:25:07,480
An inspired Spanky
tries to help out

345
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,275
by getting in the way
just as dead, dead Toby always did.

346
00:25:11,315 --> 00:25:15,321
But almost none of the data collected
in this reenactment will be of any use.

347
00:25:15,361 --> 00:25:19,241
But still, it's working.
Mother is in the moment.

348
00:25:19,281 --> 00:25:24,582
Never underestimate the tenacity
of a Winnipeg mother.

349
00:25:30,668 --> 00:25:35,341
The year 1957 saw Winnipeg embroiled
in the scandal of the Wolseley Elm

350
00:25:35,381 --> 00:25:37,635
growing out of the centre
of Wolseley Avenue,

351
00:25:37,675 --> 00:25:40,179
surrounded by a curb
and a fringe of grass

352
00:25:40,219 --> 00:25:44,808
that Ripley's Believe It or Not declared
was the smallest park in the world.

353
00:25:44,848 --> 00:25:48,312
In 1957, the city assigned a crew
to remove the elm.

354
00:25:48,352 --> 00:25:51,565
In the ensuing standoff,
a dozen elderly neighbourhood women

355
00:25:51,605 --> 00:25:55,194
encircled the tree arm in arm
to fend off the city workers' buzz saws.

356
00:25:55,234 --> 00:25:58,197
Within minutes the police had arrived,

357
00:25:58,237 --> 00:26:00,532
paddy wagons and all,
or the old biddies.

358
00:26:00,572 --> 00:26:04,245
A crowd gathered. "If they want to
chop down this tree," said one woman,

359
00:26:04,285 --> 00:26:06,622
"they're going to have to
chop us down first."

360
00:26:06,662 --> 00:26:08,707
In the end, the matter
was settled peacefully

361
00:26:08,747 --> 00:26:10,834
by newly elected mayor Stephen Juba,

362
00:26:10,874 --> 00:26:14,338
who pulled up in his Cadillac
and sent the workers home.

363
00:26:14,378 --> 00:26:16,878
Later that week, vandals,

364
00:26:16,922 --> 00:26:22,805
obviously working for the city,
blew up the tree with dynamite.

365
00:26:22,845 --> 00:26:29,561
What if? What if city hall ever listened
to the wishes of the people?

366
00:26:29,601 --> 00:26:31,601
1919.

367
00:26:32,771 --> 00:26:34,942
Returning soldiers
and police on the right.

368
00:26:34,982 --> 00:26:37,382
Our workers, stage left.

369
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:41,699
The drama of our city's
most glorious moment,

370
00:26:41,739 --> 00:26:44,139
the 1919 General Strike.

371
00:26:44,533 --> 00:26:46,578
The clash of the marchers,

372
00:26:46,618 --> 00:26:51,417
their grand parades surging from
each direction, meeting in the middle.

373
00:26:51,457 --> 00:26:54,157
Meeting where? On this day,

374
00:26:54,251 --> 00:26:58,351
in front of St. Mary's Academy for Girls.

375
00:27:01,592 --> 00:27:04,096
St. Mary's Academy for Girls,

376
00:27:04,136 --> 00:27:06,807
where the quaking little princesses
of the middle class

377
00:27:06,847 --> 00:27:09,601
tremble out their fathers'
fear of workers -

378
00:27:09,641 --> 00:27:13,272
fear the workers might actually
get paid fairly someday.

379
00:27:13,312 --> 00:27:16,442
But the workers are not to be denied.
Neither police truncheon

380
00:27:16,482 --> 00:27:20,070
nor the wealth of the bourgeoisie
can stall their determination.

381
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:23,407
The newspapers paint the workers
as Bolshevik rapists,

382
00:27:23,447 --> 00:27:27,578
which galvanizes the girls' worrisome
fathers into a frenzy of paranoia

383
00:27:27,618 --> 00:27:30,372
and sets the nuns,
those ever-opiating nuns,

384
00:27:30,412 --> 00:27:35,252
foolish as the turkeys they raise,
puffing up into a gobbling panic.

385
00:27:35,292 --> 00:27:40,716
Such was the crucible of the continent's
labour movement here in Winnipeg.

386
00:27:40,756 --> 00:27:44,457
Brave men, doing what had to be done,

387
00:27:44,551 --> 00:27:52,252
teaching the next generation to throw off
its girlish fears of the inevitable.

388
00:28:06,281 --> 00:28:10,181
The workers.
The workers' night school -

389
00:28:10,494 --> 00:28:12,956
and some of their most eager
students sleepwalk

390
00:28:12,996 --> 00:28:16,418
right out to the barricades
to meet their new teachers.

391
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:19,713
What they want they know not,
but they're gonna get it,

392
00:28:19,753 --> 00:28:23,592
and our city will be at the forefront
of the workers' rights movement

393
00:28:23,632 --> 00:28:25,632
from here on in.

394
00:28:30,889 --> 00:28:33,185
You can feel the spirit
of labour still

395
00:28:33,225 --> 00:28:36,688
whenever you walk around
St Mary's Academy at night.

396
00:28:36,728 --> 00:28:40,984
You can still see the impotent
old fence, now snow-buried,

397
00:28:41,024 --> 00:28:46,424
that once tried to keep
those heroic Bolsheviks at bay.

398
00:28:47,698 --> 00:28:52,871
Now a single sleepwalker
re-marches the same historic route

399
00:28:52,911 --> 00:28:56,312
the strikers took past the school.

400
00:28:56,873 --> 00:29:01,880
Is he remembering with his blood
those long-ago days of excitement?

401
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:06,343
Or is he just another sleepwalker
jingling his keys in his pocket?

402
00:29:06,383 --> 00:29:10,555
He's barely noticed
by anyone at St. Mary's.

403
00:29:10,595 --> 00:29:13,642
He is as invisible as I am otherwise.

404
00:29:13,682 --> 00:29:15,682
Maybe it is I.

405
00:29:26,486 --> 00:29:30,367
The closest I ever got to
St. Mary's Academy for Girls...

406
00:29:30,407 --> 00:29:33,370
I remember getting lost
as a three-year-old who rode off from home

407
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:35,580
on the seat of my little green dump truck

408
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,208
and ending up
on the grounds of St. Mary's,

409
00:29:38,248 --> 00:29:41,248
forbidden territory for a boy.

410
00:29:42,294 --> 00:29:46,675
Soon, I was surrounded by solicitous
schoolgirls who coddled me, teased me,

411
00:29:46,715 --> 00:29:50,554
held my hand, pressed me
into their blouses and kissed me

412
00:29:50,594 --> 00:29:52,764
in a kind of competition for me,

413
00:29:52,804 --> 00:29:57,404
which ended only
with the arrival of a big nun.

414
00:30:04,733 --> 00:30:07,404
Now my encounters with the students
of this fenced-in school

415
00:30:07,444 --> 00:30:11,032
are limited only
to little lunchtime sightings.

416
00:30:11,072 --> 00:30:15,120
The girls like to smoke
at Munson Park across the street.

417
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,160
Delinquent girls -

418
00:30:17,287 --> 00:30:21,187
nothing stokes
my mother's engines more!

419
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:25,797
Well, delinquent girls are
all in the past for me, Mother.

420
00:30:25,837 --> 00:30:27,924
It's time to get back to work,

421
00:30:27,964 --> 00:30:33,464
back to the task
of disentangling myself from this town.

422
00:30:35,221 --> 00:30:38,268
One scene I'm anxious to get at
is the re-creation of the time

423
00:30:38,308 --> 00:30:41,396
my sister hit a deer on the highway
coming back from Kenora.

424
00:30:41,436 --> 00:30:44,816
I felt at the time
my mother really overreacted.

425
00:30:44,856 --> 00:30:47,777
I need to view this episode again.

426
00:30:47,817 --> 00:30:51,448
Was it my sister's fault?
Was it my mother's?

427
00:30:51,488 --> 00:30:53,283
...and action!

428
00:30:53,323 --> 00:30:55,323
Mother!

429
00:30:55,658 --> 00:30:57,658
I had an accident!

430
00:30:57,702 --> 00:31:00,302
<i>An accident? With the car?</i>

431
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:05,295
<i>- I ran into a deer.
- A deer, on the highway?</i>

432
00:31:05,335 --> 00:31:08,935
There's no such thing
as an accident!

433
00:31:09,172 --> 00:31:13,178
<i>- What were you doing out there?</i>
- I told you, a track team party.

434
00:31:13,218 --> 00:31:18,016
Out in the woods where the boys
can run faster than you?

435
00:31:18,056 --> 00:31:21,227
- Come on.
- The deer wasn't dead.

436
00:31:21,267 --> 00:31:23,980
And I just stood there crying
until a driver stopped.

437
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:27,317
- And what did he want?
- He helped me, Mother.

438
00:31:27,357 --> 00:31:30,653
He got a tire iron and he put
the deer out of his misery.

439
00:31:30,693 --> 00:31:33,693
I'll bet.
Let's see the damage.

440
00:31:38,326 --> 00:31:41,414
Now, what do you have
to say for yourself?

441
00:31:41,454 --> 00:31:45,710
There's the deer fur and the blood
and the dent, just like I said.

442
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,879
I wasn't born yesterday, dearie.

443
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,519
Where did it happen?
In the backseat?

444
00:31:51,798 --> 00:31:54,761
- Where did what happen?
<i>- The real party.</i>

445
00:31:54,801 --> 00:32:00,433
Did he pin you down, or did you just
lie down and let nature take its course?

446
00:32:00,473 --> 00:32:03,394
Mother. She knows
how to read all the signs,

447
00:32:03,434 --> 00:32:06,731
those gentle substitutions
for dark wishes.

448
00:32:06,771 --> 00:32:08,399
<i>Who did it?</i>

449
00:32:08,439 --> 00:32:12,570
Was it the boy on the track team
or the man with the tire iron?

450
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:17,242
Mother, you're not making any sense.
You sound like a crazy person.

451
00:32:17,282 --> 00:32:19,782
<i>We'll see how crazy I am.</i>

452
00:32:19,951 --> 00:32:22,247
I know what it's like out there.

453
00:32:22,287 --> 00:32:25,166
<i>Every night, the same old story.</i>

454
00:32:25,206 --> 00:32:29,754
Take it off, put it in,
pull it out, do this, do that.

455
00:32:29,794 --> 00:32:31,994
Don't try my patience.

456
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:34,592
The signs,
hiding in plain sight.

457
00:32:34,632 --> 00:32:40,098
No innocent girl stays out past ten
with blood on her fender.

458
00:32:40,138 --> 00:32:43,893
- It's my life, not yours.
- Well, who gave you that life?

459
00:32:43,933 --> 00:32:46,521
- I never asked for it!
<i>- Neither did I!</i>

460
00:32:46,561 --> 00:32:48,690
And so help me,
if I could turn you in

461
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:52,694
for somebody who knows how to
take care of themselves, I would!

462
00:32:52,734 --> 00:32:55,613
Well, I wish you had.
I'd rather be an orphan!

463
00:32:55,653 --> 00:32:59,951
Don't tempt me!
Every night I look at my pills.

464
00:32:59,991 --> 00:33:02,991
One little push is all I need.

465
00:33:04,495 --> 00:33:07,291
<i>It was the man with the tire iron.</i>

466
00:33:07,331 --> 00:33:12,032
He saw the blood and the fur,
and that was that!

467
00:33:12,837 --> 00:33:15,800
It wasn't like that.
You weren't there.

468
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,635
Did he pay you?

469
00:33:17,675 --> 00:33:20,375
No! What do you think I am?

470
00:33:20,845 --> 00:33:24,308
What did all the tears
for the deer accomplish?

471
00:33:24,348 --> 00:33:26,894
<i>All it did was put you
in the mood for the other.</i>

472
00:33:26,934 --> 00:33:29,434
I'll never see him again!

473
00:33:30,646 --> 00:33:35,987
Of course not. It only took him
five minutes to find out what you are.

474
00:33:36,027 --> 00:33:38,656
My sister hit
and killed a deer.

475
00:33:38,696 --> 00:33:42,410
My mother sees through this euphemism,
for it is a euphemism.

476
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:45,496
Everything that happens in this city
is a euphemism.

477
00:33:45,536 --> 00:33:49,250
Mother understands in a second
what this deer blood and fur means,

478
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:51,419
and somehow she's right.

479
00:33:51,459 --> 00:33:54,005
She can read our family
and our civic secrets,

480
00:33:54,045 --> 00:33:59,594
our desire and our shame,
as easily as she can read a newspaper.

481
00:33:59,634 --> 00:34:01,470
Mother...

482
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:04,432
maybe the most psychic
of all Winnipeggers.

483
00:34:04,472 --> 00:34:07,852
No matter where I am,
I can feel her watching me.

484
00:34:07,892 --> 00:34:12,231
I can feel her hand on my shoulder
when I'm out sleepwalking,

485
00:34:12,271 --> 00:34:15,271
guiding me back to my own bed.

486
00:34:17,777 --> 00:34:22,033
I don't think it matters
if she's awake or asleep, living or dead,

487
00:34:22,073 --> 00:34:26,174
she'll always know
exactly what I'm doing.

488
00:34:28,037 --> 00:34:31,542
Winnipeggers have always been
skilled at reading past the surface

489
00:34:31,582 --> 00:34:34,670
and into the hidden depths
of their city.

490
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:39,342
On a small scale, we had
Curious Lou Profeta back in the 1930s.

491
00:34:39,382 --> 00:34:43,304
He was famous for de-spooking furniture
that Winnipeggers feared haunted.

492
00:34:43,344 --> 00:34:46,057
The city once even hired him
to spiritually cleanse

493
00:34:46,097 --> 00:34:51,098
a streetcar that was
giving passengers the jitters.

494
00:34:55,606 --> 00:34:58,235
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
always cited Winnipeg

495
00:34:58,275 --> 00:35:00,571
as having the greatest
psychic possibilities

496
00:35:00,611 --> 00:35:03,908
of any city he had ever visited,
possibly because of the lap,

497
00:35:03,948 --> 00:35:05,743
the fur, the frost, et cetera,

498
00:35:05,783 --> 00:35:10,915
but especially because of the Forks
and the Forks beneath the Forks.

499
00:35:10,955 --> 00:35:13,834
The first nation's people knew
how to read what Conan Doyle

500
00:35:13,874 --> 00:35:16,860
only sensed in this city,
for centuries burying their dead

501
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:21,258
as close as possible to the most
powerful confluence of our four rivers,

502
00:35:21,298 --> 00:35:25,298
Red and Assiniboine,
Red and Assiniboine.

503
00:35:31,016 --> 00:35:33,771
In the 1920s,
Thomas Glendenning Hamilton,

504
00:35:33,811 --> 00:35:36,524
distinguished Winnipeg medical doctor
and politician,

505
00:35:36,564 --> 00:35:39,944
held at his home
elaborately documented s�ances

506
00:35:39,984 --> 00:35:42,863
in the hope
of contacting his dead son.

507
00:35:42,903 --> 00:35:46,242
These nocturnal confabulations
quickly spun out

508
00:35:46,282 --> 00:35:49,620
into the viscous and cottony
hallucinations you see here,

509
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:53,040
depictions of the war
constantly waged in this city

510
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:57,211
between the two worlds
in which Winnipeggers live now

511
00:35:57,251 --> 00:36:01,851
and which they expect
to inhabit in the future.

512
00:36:04,091 --> 00:36:07,513
The most intriguing work in
the paranormal field here in Winnipeg

513
00:36:07,553 --> 00:36:10,975
was led by medium
Gweneth Lloyd back in 1939,

514
00:36:11,015 --> 00:36:13,686
the same year she co-founded
what became eventually

515
00:36:13,726 --> 00:36:15,938
the Royal Winnipeg Ballet.

516
00:36:15,978 --> 00:36:18,732
She conducted a number
of notorious s�ances

517
00:36:18,772 --> 00:36:21,110
in which she danced out,
rather than spoke,

518
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:24,822
the restless messages
from the denizens of the beyond.

519
00:36:24,862 --> 00:36:27,366
The most famous of these meetings
she conducted

520
00:36:27,406 --> 00:36:30,202
at our provincial
legislative building,

521
00:36:30,242 --> 00:36:33,247
which also happens to be
the world's largest Masonic temple,

522
00:36:33,287 --> 00:36:36,625
secretly constructed along
ancient occult specifications

523
00:36:36,665 --> 00:36:40,087
in 1922 by our premier,
Rodmond P. Roblin,

524
00:36:40,127 --> 00:36:43,674
who, along with his entire cabinet,
were third-degree Masons.

525
00:36:43,714 --> 00:36:46,552
That's the Greek god Hermes
atop our dome,

526
00:36:46,592 --> 00:36:50,431
disguised as the Golden Boy
by an armful of wheat,

527
00:36:50,471 --> 00:36:54,184
our sleepy eyes never suspecting
his fearsome pagan power

528
00:36:54,224 --> 00:36:59,225
and unlikely presence here
in modern North America.

529
00:37:00,522 --> 00:37:04,820
Present at the medium's table that night
were our city's most respected city fathers,

530
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:08,115
including the incorruptible
Mayor Cornish

531
00:37:08,155 --> 00:37:11,656
and... the madams,
or shop stewards,

532
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,079
of our illustrious brothel collectives,

533
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:18,208
women respected for their political acumen
and clout in the community.

534
00:37:18,248 --> 00:37:25,248
Countless streets in our core area
are now named for these great women.

535
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:49,151
* It's a moody Manitoba morning

536
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:55,026
* Nothing's really happening,
It never does...

537
00:41:55,066 --> 00:42:00,657
One last time through January,
the coldest, darkest month.

538
00:42:00,697 --> 00:42:02,659
* To bring me a letter...

539
00:42:02,699 --> 00:42:06,120
Deepest part of the winter,
no end in sight.

540
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,260
The condoms come off.

541
00:42:08,329 --> 00:42:11,084
These are the bareback months
of Winnipeg.

542
00:42:11,124 --> 00:42:13,545
Your breath freezes
in front of your face

543
00:42:13,585 --> 00:42:17,006
and falls to your feet with a tinkle.

544
00:42:17,046 --> 00:42:20,301
Man and dog,
we walk the streets...

545
00:42:20,341 --> 00:42:22,941
my guide dog through time.

546
00:42:24,178 --> 00:42:26,578
* And I like it that way

547
00:42:28,016 --> 00:42:30,228
Even people who have never
encountered snow

548
00:42:30,268 --> 00:42:32,730
can imagine what it's like
to walk through it.

549
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:35,692
You leave footprints, declivities.

550
00:42:35,732 --> 00:42:38,611
When you step on fresh snow,
you pack it down.

551
00:42:38,651 --> 00:42:42,865
You pack it down onto the sidewalk, and
when all the loose snow later blows away,

552
00:42:42,905 --> 00:42:46,411
it actually leaves a positive record
of that negative space.

553
00:42:46,451 --> 00:42:50,081
It leaves your footstep
as a kind of little relief record of it.

554
00:42:50,121 --> 00:42:53,042
I like to think of these things
as snow fossils.

555
00:42:53,082 --> 00:42:56,587
They don't last 600 million years.
They only last a few months.

556
00:42:56,627 --> 00:42:59,257
But you can actually trace
through these snow fossils

557
00:42:59,297 --> 00:43:03,553
your own passage up and down your
sidewalk over the course of a winter.

558
00:43:03,593 --> 00:43:09,100
It's a way of walking backward
and forward in winter's time.

559
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:11,140
Winnipeg.

560
00:43:11,893 --> 00:43:17,025
We negotiate the great white ways,
the snow labyrinths,

561
00:43:17,065 --> 00:43:22,071
mazes of ectoplasm which determine
our paths through our lives here.

562
00:43:22,111 --> 00:43:25,742
We have little or no choice
where we go, where we sleep,

563
00:43:25,782 --> 00:43:27,782
what we feel.

564
00:43:30,078 --> 00:43:35,578
A city of palimpsests, of skins,
of skins beneath skins.

565
00:43:38,586 --> 00:43:42,186
How to decode the signs of the city?

566
00:43:43,633 --> 00:43:46,033
Another civic law here -

567
00:43:46,427 --> 00:43:50,767
we're not allowed to destroy
old signage, any old signage.

568
00:43:50,807 --> 00:43:53,908
Instead it's kept, kept forever

569
00:43:54,852 --> 00:43:57,752
at the old signage graveyard.

570
00:43:58,105 --> 00:44:01,405
Dip into the layers
of Winnipeg...

571
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:07,116
a city just four years older
than my grandmother.

572
00:44:07,156 --> 00:44:11,956
Sometimes so young-seeming,
sometimes so ancient.

573
00:44:12,286 --> 00:44:16,987
Frightening.
Frightening is one's place in time.

574
00:44:25,216 --> 00:44:29,722
When the snow starts falling,
the city starts to feel lawless -

575
00:44:29,762 --> 00:44:31,762
lawless but safe.

576
00:44:32,556 --> 00:44:38,064
All the painted lines on the street
are erased by snow, and anything goes.

577
00:44:38,104 --> 00:44:41,400
It's a big game
of bump'em-cars out there.

578
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,277
The lights look pretty.

579
00:44:43,317 --> 00:44:46,447
You can't even see
out of your windshield half the time.

580
00:44:46,487 --> 00:44:50,201
You know you can glide sideways,
skidding through a red light,

581
00:44:50,241 --> 00:44:53,041
and the cops will let it go.

582
00:45:04,463 --> 00:45:07,468
In Winnipeg, it's way more fun
for us to cross the city

583
00:45:07,508 --> 00:45:10,108
using only its back lanes.

584
00:45:11,303 --> 00:45:15,601
The city possesses a vast network
of these unofficial streets,

585
00:45:15,641 --> 00:45:19,105
a fine grid-like work
of narrow unspoken-of byways

586
00:45:19,145 --> 00:45:22,108
that hold a charm all of their own.

587
00:45:22,148 --> 00:45:25,903
They're not even allowed on city maps,
but the populace knows all about them

588
00:45:25,943 --> 00:45:30,143
and uses them
more than legitimate streets.

589
00:45:32,992 --> 00:45:36,580
A dispute between the city's
two main taxi companies was settled

590
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:39,709
by giving one company the rights
to use the regular streets,

591
00:45:39,749 --> 00:45:46,715
while the other company must pick up and
drop off its fares only in the back lanes.

592
00:45:46,755 --> 00:45:50,886
It's inside these black arteries
where the real Winnipeg is found,

593
00:45:50,926 --> 00:45:54,515
where memories
most plausibly come alive.

594
00:45:54,555 --> 00:45:59,061
The network of these lanes suggests
the grid of a secret city

595
00:45:59,101 --> 00:46:01,981
laid right on top
of the known one.

596
00:46:02,021 --> 00:46:05,025
Lanes with names remembered
only by word of mouth

597
00:46:05,065 --> 00:46:09,530
lie on top of streets named after
politicians and land developers.

598
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:14,034
The lanes are illicit things
best not discussed - shameful.

599
00:46:14,074 --> 00:46:16,704
They receive the breech ends
of the houses,

600
00:46:16,744 --> 00:46:20,541
the side of the home not meant
for polite company.

601
00:46:20,581 --> 00:46:23,544
They are the weedy landscapes
of shameful abandonment,

602
00:46:23,584 --> 00:46:26,046
the conduits of refuse removal.

603
00:46:26,086 --> 00:46:29,049
Here we strew what we no longer
want to acknowledge,

604
00:46:29,089 --> 00:46:31,886
and everything,
most notably the Winnipeg special -

605
00:46:31,926 --> 00:46:34,513
a mattress bent over
with fatal stains -

606
00:46:34,553 --> 00:46:39,953
is quickly covered up
by the forgetfulness of our snow.

607
00:46:43,854 --> 00:46:46,442
I am man's best friend,
and also man's...

608
00:46:46,482 --> 00:46:50,404
In the alleyways,
strange wavelengths dominate.

609
00:46:50,444 --> 00:46:53,657
The dispatcher
seems to speak directly to you.

610
00:46:53,697 --> 00:46:56,243
Yes, I got that this morning...

611
00:46:56,283 --> 00:46:59,538
The driving is softer,
soft as a cushion,

612
00:46:59,578 --> 00:47:01,878
a white pillow plumped.

613
00:47:08,128 --> 00:47:11,258
Then there's the strange case
of Lorette -

614
00:47:11,298 --> 00:47:13,427
a hermaphrodite street.

615
00:47:13,467 --> 00:47:17,268
It's half front street,
half back lane.

616
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:21,890
No one speaks of Lorette.

617
00:47:40,035 --> 00:47:43,165
Even the architecture
in Winnipeg is sad,

618
00:47:43,205 --> 00:47:46,405
has an addled concept of itself.

619
00:47:47,584 --> 00:47:51,381
Emblematic of this is
the Arlington Street Bridge,

620
00:47:51,421 --> 00:47:54,718
a vast span of unfrosted
steel girders

621
00:47:54,758 --> 00:47:59,264
which arches over
the city's sprawling train yards,

622
00:47:59,304 --> 00:48:06,304
where trains couple in the fog,
rumble on awhile, then noisily divorce.

623
00:48:06,979 --> 00:48:09,608
The bridge, manufactured
some 100 years ago

624
00:48:09,648 --> 00:48:11,819
by the Vulcan Iron Works of London,

625
00:48:11,859 --> 00:48:16,406
was originally destined for Egypt,
where it was to span the Nile.

626
00:48:16,446 --> 00:48:20,911
But a mistake in specs made the fit
with that river impossible,

627
00:48:20,951 --> 00:48:27,752
and the bridge was sold at a bargain price
to bargain-crazy Winnipeg.

628
00:48:29,543 --> 00:48:33,507
The bridge has not adjusted well
to its always-strapped foster home,

629
00:48:33,547 --> 00:48:37,469
and it often turns in its sleep
when it is possibly dreaming

630
00:48:37,509 --> 00:48:40,180
of its lush and joyous
originally intended home

631
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:43,321
and pops a girder out of place.

632
00:48:46,226 --> 00:48:48,939
The sounds that groan up
from the yard at night

633
00:48:48,979 --> 00:48:53,680
resemble the agonies
of some colossal arthritis.

634
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:10,002
Just as the Arlington Street Bridge
dreams of the Nile,

635
00:49:10,042 --> 00:49:14,339
we have another dreaming
man-made feature of the skyline,

636
00:49:14,379 --> 00:49:18,051
this one an impostor of
the landscape, Garbage Hill,

637
00:49:18,091 --> 00:49:22,264
the only hill in otherwise
board-flat Winnipeg.

638
00:49:22,304 --> 00:49:25,510
Made from a half-century
of the population's trash,

639
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:31,106
then grassed over and passed off
as a park a generation ago.

640
00:49:31,146 --> 00:49:34,609
This great mound,
home to tobogganing children,

641
00:49:34,649 --> 00:49:38,249
dreams its filthy dreams of garbage.

642
00:49:41,573 --> 00:49:44,077
It's not uncommon for kids
sliding down this hill

643
00:49:44,117 --> 00:49:47,456
to be impaled on a rusty piece of rail
or old car fender

644
00:49:47,496 --> 00:49:50,996
that's been heaved up by the frost.

645
00:49:56,421 --> 00:49:58,421
My Winnipeg.

646
00:50:02,302 --> 00:50:06,433
A horrific chain reaction of architectural
tragedies started in the late '90s

647
00:50:06,473 --> 00:50:09,644
when our titanic Eaton's department store
on Portage Avenue

648
00:50:09,684 --> 00:50:14,284
hit that prairie iceberg and sank -
bankruptcy.

649
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:18,612
Eaton's once dominated this city,
to the point where over 65 cents

650
00:50:18,652 --> 00:50:22,616
of every Winnipeg shopping dollar
was spent at this single store.

651
00:50:22,656 --> 00:50:27,496
To say it defined Winnipeg retail
would be no exaggeration.

652
00:50:27,536 --> 00:50:29,789
After the bankruptcy,
our civic government,

653
00:50:29,829 --> 00:50:33,001
without even trying to dream up
a second life for the old store,

654
00:50:33,041 --> 00:50:36,441
suddenly and unforgivably
razed it.

655
00:50:37,546 --> 00:50:40,509
Demolition is one of our city's
few growth industries.

656
00:50:40,549 --> 00:50:45,805
Overnight, construction of a new arena
on the old Eaton's site was announced.

657
00:50:45,845 --> 00:50:50,310
Curiously, after years
of fighting, resisting, refusing

658
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:52,646
to build a new rink
for the NHL Jets,

659
00:50:52,686 --> 00:50:54,814
allowing them
to abandon us for Phoenix,

660
00:50:54,854 --> 00:51:00,111
city council suddenly rushed out this
new architectural lie to Winnipeggers.

661
00:51:00,151 --> 00:51:04,783
The result, a sterile new thrift rink
for minor league hockey,

662
00:51:04,823 --> 00:51:06,952
with too few seats
to reach the NHL minimum,

663
00:51:06,992 --> 00:51:10,455
should a miracle ever give us
another shot at playing in the big leagues,

664
00:51:10,495 --> 00:51:13,792
a ridiculous,
politically motivated tragedy

665
00:51:13,832 --> 00:51:17,732
with the corporate name "Empty Centre".

666
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:22,550
I'm sure memories will accumulate
in this "Empty Centre",

667
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:26,721
which has nothing but low-priced newness
to recommend it.

668
00:51:26,761 --> 00:51:29,182
Until then, this thoughtless
new building just sits

669
00:51:29,222 --> 00:51:33,561
on the windswept downtown corner
like a zombie in a cheap new suit,

670
00:51:33,601 --> 00:51:37,482
its brick coat somehow meant
as an homage to atomized Eaton's,

671
00:51:37,522 --> 00:51:41,486
but coming off more as an insult
to the grand old department store,

672
00:51:41,526 --> 00:51:43,526
and an insult to us.

673
00:51:46,573 --> 00:51:48,673
Now the real tragedy.

674
00:51:48,908 --> 00:51:52,038
Since we've suddenly ended up
with two large hockey arenas,

675
00:51:52,078 --> 00:51:54,541
the real Winnipeg Arena,
the old Winnipeg Arena,

676
00:51:54,581 --> 00:51:58,670
the most fabled, myth-and-memory-packed
landmark in our city's history,

677
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:00,380
has been condemned.

678
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:05,220
Condemned!
In fact, demolition has already begun.

679
00:52:05,633 --> 00:52:09,556
For 50 years, this ice hockey cathedral
fit Winnipeg and its sport

680
00:52:09,596 --> 00:52:11,724
like a skull fits its brain.

681
00:52:11,764 --> 00:52:14,644
This building was my male parent,

682
00:52:14,684 --> 00:52:20,484
and everything male in my childhood
I picked up right here.

683
00:52:20,732 --> 00:52:24,571
I was even born here...
right in this dressing room.

684
00:52:24,611 --> 00:52:26,611
Look at it.

685
00:52:27,906 --> 00:52:30,160
Born during a game between
the Winnipeg Maroons

686
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,412
and the Trail Smoke Eaters.

687
00:52:32,452 --> 00:52:35,248
I was bundled up and taken
straight home after the game

688
00:52:35,288 --> 00:52:39,294
and brought back a few days later
to watch my first complete contest.

689
00:52:39,334 --> 00:52:42,255
My dad worked behind the bench
for the Winnipeg Maroons,

690
00:52:42,295 --> 00:52:44,257
the 1964 Allan Cup winners,

691
00:52:44,297 --> 00:52:47,260
senior hockey champs
in the days of the Original Six.

692
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,596
And for the Canadian national team
as well,

693
00:52:49,636 --> 00:52:52,432
as Winnipeg hosted
in wave upon frightening wave

694
00:52:52,472 --> 00:52:55,602
visits from the revolutionary
juggernaut Soviet team,

695
00:52:55,642 --> 00:52:57,937
years before the hubristic NHL

696
00:52:57,977 --> 00:53:01,107
deigned to hold
its first Summit Series in 1972.

697
00:53:01,147 --> 00:53:05,028
Here's my ticket for game three
of that series, a four-all tie,

698
00:53:05,068 --> 00:53:07,447
a dull game compared
to the electrifying contests

699
00:53:07,487 --> 00:53:11,451
typically held here at the world capital
of international hockey.

700
00:53:11,491 --> 00:53:13,703
The NHL never liked us
here in Winnipeg.

701
00:53:13,743 --> 00:53:18,416
They raked us of our best players
when we joined up with them in 1979.

702
00:53:18,456 --> 00:53:20,793
I grew up in the locker rooms,

703
00:53:20,833 --> 00:53:23,796
was breastfed there
in the wives' chambers,

704
00:53:23,836 --> 00:53:27,383
and was often lent out to visiting teams
as a stick boy.

705
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:30,720
I met my first superstar
in the Soviet showers,

706
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:35,141
dazzled by Anatoly Firsov
as he emerged from the steam,

707
00:53:35,181 --> 00:53:38,186
naked except for the lather
mantling his torso.

708
00:53:38,226 --> 00:53:40,271
Positively smitten by him,

709
00:53:40,311 --> 00:53:43,274
I once stole
his famed number 11 jersey,

710
00:53:43,314 --> 00:53:45,818
taking it home and sliding it
over my nude body

711
00:53:45,858 --> 00:53:48,613
to take a few erotically charged
secret slap shots

712
00:53:48,653 --> 00:53:52,825
before tossing it into the Forks
for fear the KGB would catch me wearing it.

713
00:53:52,865 --> 00:53:58,665
I nearly fainted from the touch
of its fabric and the fear.

714
00:54:01,707 --> 00:54:06,005
On off days, I would go to the arena
for the strange pleasure I could produce

715
00:54:06,045 --> 00:54:09,383
by flipping down
every one of the 10,000 seats,

716
00:54:09,423 --> 00:54:14,523
admiring them,
then flipping them all back up again.

717
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:23,050
Urine, breast milk, sweat -

718
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:28,236
the hockey cathedral�s
holy trinity of odours.

719
00:54:28,276 --> 00:54:32,532
These are the smells that will haunt
this holy site forever,

720
00:54:32,572 --> 00:54:37,078
no matter what blasphemy is built
here in its stead.

721
00:54:37,118 --> 00:54:41,219
And rest assured,
it shall be a blasphemy.

722
00:54:41,747 --> 00:54:43,709
When the national team was disbanded

723
00:54:43,749 --> 00:54:48,548
by a federal bureaucrat's stroke of a pen
in 1970, my father died.

724
00:54:48,588 --> 00:54:51,884
With nothing left to do, he died.

725
00:54:51,924 --> 00:54:56,305
I'd like to say he spontaneously combusted
right on the ice of the arena.

726
00:54:56,345 --> 00:55:00,226
That would have been great.
But it was quieter than that.

727
00:55:00,266 --> 00:55:05,567
He shrank into a puff
of cigarette smoke and was gone.

728
00:55:06,063 --> 00:55:10,152
Now my building lies
like a heart ripped open in the snow,

729
00:55:10,192 --> 00:55:13,531
closed to the public
which worshipped in it.

730
00:55:13,571 --> 00:55:16,659
What if Eaton's
had never gone down?

731
00:55:16,699 --> 00:55:18,699
What if?

732
00:55:19,076 --> 00:55:24,083
But an odd assortment of players
in their 70s, 80s, 90s and beyond

733
00:55:24,123 --> 00:55:29,297
continues to play in the old barn despite
the first few thumps of the wreckers' ball.

734
00:55:29,337 --> 00:55:32,758
The team is called
the Black Tuesdays,

735
00:55:32,798 --> 00:55:38,055
in defiance of the day in October 1929
when the world crashed into depression.

736
00:55:38,095 --> 00:55:43,060
The players are old Jets, Maroons,
or from earlier eras -

737
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:45,771
the Warriors, the Victorias,

738
00:55:45,811 --> 00:55:49,233
even the Falcons, who won Canada's
first Olympic gold medal in hockey

739
00:55:49,273 --> 00:55:51,273
in Antwerp, 1920.

740
00:55:51,984 --> 00:55:57,241
Cec Browne, voted athlete
of Manitoba's first century in 1970.

741
00:55:57,281 --> 00:56:00,881
Ollie Turnbull.
Buster Thornsteinson.

742
00:56:02,495 --> 00:56:05,295
Curly-headed George Cumbers.

743
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:09,253
Smiley Dzama, so named
for the numerous head injuries

744
00:56:09,293 --> 00:56:12,423
which have left him eternally happy.

745
00:56:12,463 --> 00:56:15,468
Other veteran greats -
Baldy Northcott,

746
00:56:15,508 --> 00:56:18,220
Fred Dunsmore,
greatest of all the Maroons

747
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:21,098
and best athlete
in the history of Manitoba.

748
00:56:21,138 --> 00:56:24,685
As a child, lived at three different
addresses, all of them on Minto Street.

749
00:56:24,725 --> 00:56:27,688
Strangely, and perhaps a testament
to the mystical synchronicities

750
00:56:27,728 --> 00:56:31,192
always holding sway in this city,
his future wife Margaret dwelt as a child

751
00:56:31,232 --> 00:56:35,279
in the same three houses, long before
ever meeting her future husband.

752
00:56:35,319 --> 00:56:38,119
Billy Mosienko, Winnipegger,

753
00:56:38,572 --> 00:56:42,661
scorer of the fastest hat trick
in NHL history of 21 seconds,

754
00:56:42,701 --> 00:56:46,874
and owner of a fantastic
bowling alley on North Main.

755
00:56:46,914 --> 00:56:49,835
On the Falcons,
Konnie Johannesson...

756
00:56:49,875 --> 00:56:53,672
Frankie Fredrickson,
the most beautiful of all the Falcons...

757
00:56:53,712 --> 00:56:55,260
Huck Woodman.

758
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:58,560
It is even rumoured that the heavily
bandaged goaltender who plays

759
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:02,360
is the late Terry Sawchuk, the NHL's
all-time leader in wins and shutouts

760
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,893
at the time of his mysterious death
over three decades ago.

761
00:57:05,933 --> 00:57:09,134
But that's impossible,
of course.

762
00:57:11,772 --> 00:57:14,026
They suit up in the collapsing
old dressing room

763
00:57:14,066 --> 00:57:17,566
where they laced them up as youths.

764
00:57:19,446 --> 00:57:23,869
No one knows why the Black Tuesdays
formed. They aren't saying.

765
00:57:23,909 --> 00:57:26,372
I'd like to think they did it
to protest the grotesque greed

766
00:57:26,412 --> 00:57:28,916
of the National Hockey League,
which made the sport too rich

767
00:57:28,956 --> 00:57:33,057
for this sleepwalking,
working-class town.

768
00:57:35,629 --> 00:57:40,761
Game-playing reveries,
lost in time, mischievous time.

769
00:57:40,801 --> 00:57:43,801
Time flies when you're flying.

770
00:57:53,647 --> 00:57:58,904
The unfeeling coroner's chisel
breaks in the bones of the temples,

771
00:57:58,944 --> 00:58:01,044
gets at the memories.

772
00:58:04,283 --> 00:58:08,497
With great sadness, for the last time
ever, and wearing a hard hat,

773
00:58:08,537 --> 00:58:11,750
I relieve myself as I've done
a million times before

774
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:14,670
in the building's famed
urinal trough,

775
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:19,174
the last man in the illustrious history
of this temple to do so.

776
00:58:19,214 --> 00:58:23,178
Within minutes,
the trough will be ripped into oblivion,

777
00:58:23,218 --> 00:58:29,419
and soon, too, will the great careers
of these wonderful souls.

778
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:39,931
OK, we're gonna go.
Five, four, three, two, one.

779
00:58:41,069 --> 00:58:43,069
Fire go off!

780
00:58:54,249 --> 00:58:56,949
Go, Jets, go! Go, Jets, go!

781
00:58:58,378 --> 00:59:01,078
Go, Jets, go! Go, Jets, go!

782
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,440
Kind of a strange victory.

783
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:09,266
Only the part of the arena
added in 1979

784
00:59:09,306 --> 00:59:11,977
to accommodate the arrival
of the NHL in town

785
00:59:12,017 --> 00:59:16,148
falls off the arena
when the dynamite goes off.

786
00:59:16,188 --> 00:59:18,888
This I interpret as a sign,

787
00:59:19,441 --> 00:59:24,541
a sign that we should never
have joined that league.

788
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:30,245
I really sort of hoped that this would be
some kind of stay of execution,

789
00:59:30,285 --> 00:59:32,285
but, no.

790
00:59:33,622 --> 00:59:38,170
Why did this happen?
Why was this allowed to happen?

791
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:40,310
The arena, my father,

792
00:59:42,089 --> 00:59:46,470
the paternal amphitheatre
of our game, murdered,

793
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:49,848
all because he lacked luxury boxes.

794
00:59:49,888 --> 00:59:52,976
Here we pride ourselves on
the tradition of labour,

795
00:59:53,016 --> 00:59:58,190
and we allow our shrine to be outraged
for its lack of luxury boxes.

796
00:59:58,230 --> 01:00:02,611
I'm ashamed of us,
ashamed to be a Winnipegger.

797
01:00:02,651 --> 01:00:04,651
Farewell.

798
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:07,350
Farewell, beloved father.

799
01:00:16,164 --> 01:00:19,336
One final experiment at 800 Ellice.

800
01:00:19,376 --> 01:00:23,090
It was really rare for me
to side with my mother in family disputes.

801
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:26,885
I must revisit an incident
which puts her in a sympathetic light

802
01:00:26,925 --> 01:00:30,722
to see if it parses out
the same way this time around.

803
01:00:30,762 --> 01:00:32,862
...frame, and action.

804
01:00:33,348 --> 01:00:36,520
<i>Wake up, Mother!
Wake up! Wake up, Mother!</i>

805
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:38,560
- Wake up!
- No! Mm.

806
01:00:40,105 --> 01:00:42,734
<i>- Mother, please wake up!</i>
- What do you want?

807
01:00:42,774 --> 01:00:45,904
You have to feed us.
We're so hungry.

808
01:00:45,944 --> 01:00:48,573
Well, go and make yourselves
something.

809
01:00:48,613 --> 01:00:51,910
I'm too old to cook anymore.
My cooking days are over.

810
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:54,871
- Do you want us to starve?
- I don't know where the pans are.

811
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:57,707
Well, just go make yourselves
some toast.

812
01:00:57,747 --> 01:01:01,127
- We burned the toast.
- Nothing tastes good unless you make it.

813
01:01:01,167 --> 01:01:04,756
- We throw everything out.
- Or throw it up. It won't stay down.

814
01:01:04,796 --> 01:01:07,801
Well, I don't have any more recipes
in my head.

815
01:01:07,841 --> 01:01:10,341
My cooking days are over.

816
01:01:10,468 --> 01:01:13,098
Whatever you make for yourself,
we can share a little.

817
01:01:13,138 --> 01:01:15,538
No. What's mine is mine.

818
01:01:16,308 --> 01:01:18,937
We brought the parakeet with us.

819
01:01:18,977 --> 01:01:20,977
What was that?

820
01:01:21,646 --> 01:01:25,485
- We brought the parakeet with us.
- How dare you!

821
01:01:25,525 --> 01:01:28,113
- You were warned.
- We tried to be nice.

822
01:01:28,153 --> 01:01:30,782
- And you didn't listen.
- Oh!

823
01:01:30,822 --> 01:01:34,828
- Go get her, Muli!
<i>- Oh, get him away from me, please!</i>

824
01:01:34,868 --> 01:01:38,468
- Spray your filth in her hair.
- Oh!

825
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:42,836
My mother's always had
a strange fear of birds -

826
01:01:42,876 --> 01:01:45,964
I don't know where it came from -
and messy hair, too.

827
01:01:46,004 --> 01:01:48,425
I remember once we were down
in Warroad, Minnesota,

828
01:01:48,465 --> 01:01:51,511
visiting some friends who had
a 75-year-old mynah bird

829
01:01:51,551 --> 01:01:55,598
that had an immense vocabulary
and was allowed to fly free in the house.

830
01:01:55,638 --> 01:01:59,269
It landed on my mother's shoulder,
and she smashed it to the floor.

831
01:01:59,309 --> 01:02:02,355
Destroyed, just killed the thing
with one blow.

832
01:02:02,395 --> 01:02:04,691
The thing had been living happily
for 75 years

833
01:02:04,731 --> 01:02:08,361
and its life was snuffed out
just like that.

834
01:02:08,401 --> 01:02:10,401
Oh!

835
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:11,823
<i>Get him away from me!</i>

836
01:02:11,863 --> 01:02:14,617
I'll call him off if you get up
and make us some meat loaf.

837
01:02:14,657 --> 01:02:16,657
- Right now!
- Oh!

838
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:22,121
There's another one
for the logbook.

839
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:32,500
Whittier Park, 1926,
early in the winter...

840
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:34,846
a first horrible snap of cold.

841
01:02:34,886 --> 01:02:36,723
A fire in the paddocks,

842
01:02:36,763 --> 01:02:39,893
started when a squirrel
scorched itself on a power cable.

843
01:02:39,933 --> 01:02:45,064
The horses panicked, frightened,
wildly fleeing from the flames.

844
01:02:45,104 --> 01:02:50,487
One last race for their lives,
out into that cruel snap of cold,

845
01:02:50,527 --> 01:02:53,573
no other way to escape the flames
but to cross the Red River.

846
01:02:53,613 --> 01:02:57,869
Swimming in the current,
swimming, fighting the current,

847
01:02:57,909 --> 01:03:01,289
that current clogging with
jagged chunks of freeze-up.

848
01:03:01,329 --> 01:03:04,500
The ice takes on heft, deadliness.

849
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:08,504
Horribly, everything clogs.
Both horse and ice clog together,

850
01:03:08,544 --> 01:03:13,344
an ice-and-horse jam
piles and paralyses, locks -

851
01:03:13,424 --> 01:03:16,512
locks each animal in place
by its panicked, bulging neck,

852
01:03:16,552 --> 01:03:18,652
by its frenzied head.

853
01:03:22,934 --> 01:03:25,563
The heads stay this way
for the whole winter -

854
01:03:25,603 --> 01:03:27,690
five months at the Forks -

855
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:30,735
like 11 knights
on a vast white chessboard.

856
01:03:30,775 --> 01:03:33,275
A great public spectacle.

857
01:03:33,444 --> 01:03:39,645
We grow used to the sadness,
simply incorporated into our days.

858
01:03:39,784 --> 01:03:44,290
Soon, the Holly Snowshoe Club embarks
on weekly jaunts out to the horse heads

859
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:47,085
and holds little jamborees there.

860
01:03:47,125 --> 01:03:52,382
Winter strollers visit the heads frequently,
often on romantic rambles.

861
01:03:52,422 --> 01:03:56,094
Lovers gather to sit among,
or even on, the frozen heads

862
01:03:56,134 --> 01:04:00,598
for picnics or to spoon beneath
the moonlit dome of our city.

863
01:04:00,638 --> 01:04:04,811
The horse heads are always frozen
in those same transports of animal panic,

864
01:04:04,851 --> 01:04:09,440
an abandonment reading unambiguously
to the young lovers of Winnipeg.

865
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:13,444
The city enjoys a tremendous baby boom
the following autumn.

866
01:04:13,484 --> 01:04:15,684
Humans born of horses.

867
01:04:16,779 --> 01:04:18,779
Happiness.

868
01:04:25,371 --> 01:04:28,334
Now without a racetrack
to slake the city's thirst for betting,

869
01:04:28,374 --> 01:04:31,921
Winnipeggers turn to wagering
on unsanctioned, illicit events -

870
01:04:31,961 --> 01:04:35,091
the Golden Boy pageants held
at the Paddlewheel Nightclub,

871
01:04:35,131 --> 01:04:38,970
which sits atop the brand-new Hudson's
Bay department store on Portage Avenue,

872
01:04:39,010 --> 01:04:42,810
Eaton's little sister down the street.

873
01:04:43,389 --> 01:04:45,389
Man pageants.

874
01:04:46,017 --> 01:04:49,063
The men are beautiful,
the betting is heavy.

875
01:04:49,103 --> 01:04:52,525
Otherwise incorruptible Mayor Cornish
ignores our city's bylaws

876
01:04:52,565 --> 01:04:56,863
and presides as the lone judge
at these lurid contests.

877
01:04:56,903 --> 01:04:59,657
He picks the Golden Boy,
makes or loses fortunes

878
01:04:59,697 --> 01:05:03,536
for those patrons in thrall
to the vice of gambling.

879
01:05:03,576 --> 01:05:06,330
Trotting, trotting, trotting...

880
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:08,970
on parade for the mayor...

881
01:05:09,081 --> 01:05:11,381
on parade for Winnipeg,

882
01:05:12,418 --> 01:05:15,018
thoroughbreds one and all.

883
01:05:15,212 --> 01:05:19,927
Women only
in the Crinoline Court section, please!

884
01:05:19,967 --> 01:05:23,681
The advent of modern
Winnipeg nightlife.

885
01:05:23,721 --> 01:05:28,821
What does one have to do
to be named the Golden Boy?

886
01:05:29,685 --> 01:05:32,185
What is beauty?
Who knows?

887
01:05:35,941 --> 01:05:39,030
That's for the mayor to decide.

888
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:41,070
Desire.

889
01:05:41,405 --> 01:05:45,005
Selecting the lucky one...
the one...

890
01:05:45,284 --> 01:05:47,284
the Golden Boy.

891
01:05:53,542 --> 01:05:57,089
The Mayor Cornish era ended in 1940
when scandal erupted

892
01:05:57,129 --> 01:06:02,094
over the high number of Golden Boys
holding down golden jobs at city hall.

893
01:06:02,134 --> 01:06:07,058
These debauched Cornish years
were known as "the orange Jell-O days",

894
01:06:07,098 --> 01:06:09,143
when the city jiggled
to the tempo

895
01:06:09,183 --> 01:06:11,937
set by that simple but timelessly
delicious dessert

896
01:06:11,977 --> 01:06:14,899
served in the Paddlewheel
as its house speciality.

897
01:06:14,939 --> 01:06:17,639
Jell-O. Only orange Jell-O.

898
01:06:19,276 --> 01:06:23,032
Night manna, squirting through the teeth
into the outer regions of the mouth

899
01:06:23,072 --> 01:06:25,117
and then back
into its centre again.

900
01:06:25,157 --> 01:06:30,557
An endless cycle,
the wheel of Jell-O, the Paddlewheel.

901
01:06:31,247 --> 01:06:35,044
Betting action at the Paddlewheel,
that once-vibrant penthouse of iniquity,

902
01:06:35,084 --> 01:06:38,422
drops off rapidly
in the decades that follow.

903
01:06:38,462 --> 01:06:41,425
Hard to work up much enthusiasm
for the pipe-smoking contest

904
01:06:41,465 --> 01:06:43,636
held every weekend in the '50s,

905
01:06:43,676 --> 01:06:50,876
and by the '60s, there is nothing much
left but memories of better times.

906
01:06:52,393 --> 01:06:55,494
Nowadays, I fear for the store.

907
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:59,944
Even sleepwalkers
are hard to find here.

908
01:06:59,984 --> 01:07:03,280
One last time, I can still
make my way up to the fifth floor.

909
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:06,020
Unimpeded by any customers,

910
01:07:06,073 --> 01:07:08,786
where the Bay rents out space
to the always nomadic

911
01:07:08,826 --> 01:07:11,121
Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame.

912
01:07:11,161 --> 01:07:13,707
There I can find my sister,

913
01:07:13,747 --> 01:07:16,627
and of course, Fred Dunsmore.

914
01:07:16,667 --> 01:07:20,631
Oh, Fred, why does the Hall of Fame
always choose such thin ice

915
01:07:20,671 --> 01:07:24,510
upon which to erect
its memorial columns?

916
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:28,514
Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame has moved
many times since I first heard of it.

917
01:07:28,554 --> 01:07:31,976
Every time it moves into a building,
the building goes bankrupt.

918
01:07:32,016 --> 01:07:37,273
It has to pick up all its photos and banners
and sleepwalk to another home.

919
01:07:37,313 --> 01:07:39,513
I worry about the Bay.

920
01:07:41,025 --> 01:07:43,112
Will we always have
the Bay blankets,

921
01:07:43,152 --> 01:07:46,282
the blankets worn by my dad's teams,
the famous point blankets

922
01:07:46,322 --> 01:07:51,036
which have been currency
for our fur traders since 1670?

923
01:07:51,076 --> 01:07:54,290
The city council can't possibly
tear this building down.

924
01:07:54,330 --> 01:07:57,334
Not again would they dare
commit such a murder.

925
01:07:57,374 --> 01:08:02,381
Well, why not? They've killed before,
and they're unrepentant.

926
01:08:02,421 --> 01:08:05,721
What if they do it again?
What if?

927
01:08:10,095 --> 01:08:12,095
Wake up.

928
01:08:12,222 --> 01:08:15,269
You must make one last visit
to your beloved Sherbrooke Pool,

929
01:08:15,309 --> 01:08:17,396
already two-thirds closed.

930
01:08:17,436 --> 01:08:21,567
Built in 1931 as a Depression-era
make-work project,

931
01:08:21,607 --> 01:08:25,070
the facility is actually
three swimming pools in one building,

932
01:08:25,110 --> 01:08:27,698
but stacked vertically,
one atop another,

933
01:08:27,738 --> 01:08:31,368
perhaps the only building of its sort
in the world.

934
01:08:31,408 --> 01:08:33,708
Segregated by gender...

935
01:08:34,411 --> 01:08:36,511
segregated by depths.

936
01:08:39,917 --> 01:08:44,417
Families swam on the main level,
street level.

937
01:08:45,130 --> 01:08:48,630
But one level deeper, it was girls.

938
01:08:48,759 --> 01:08:50,759
Girls only.

939
01:08:52,763 --> 01:08:58,061
And deeper still, in the deepest
of deepest basements,

940
01:08:58,101 --> 01:09:01,001
it was the boys, only boys...

941
01:09:01,146 --> 01:09:04,046
...in the steam and dankness.

942
01:09:08,237 --> 01:09:11,742
Back in grade five, I was invited
for a Saturday swim at the baths

943
01:09:11,782 --> 01:09:14,745
by my old school chums,
only to find upon arriving

944
01:09:14,785 --> 01:09:19,666
my friends had no intention
of ever getting into the water.

945
01:09:19,706 --> 01:09:25,047
Instead, they stripped naked to cavort
the day long in the changing rooms.

946
01:09:25,087 --> 01:09:29,468
The little savages in their Saturday trances
wanted me to strip too,

947
01:09:29,508 --> 01:09:32,137
surrounded me,
aroused with excitements,

948
01:09:32,177 --> 01:09:35,307
and threatened to send high-arcing
streams of urine onto me

949
01:09:35,347 --> 01:09:38,810
unless I joined them
in their downy caperings...

950
01:09:38,850 --> 01:09:42,850
with engorged little members...
hairless.

951
01:09:44,231 --> 01:09:46,231
Why? Why? Why?

952
01:09:47,484 --> 01:09:49,784
Why don't we just swim?

953
01:09:51,989 --> 01:09:53,992
While making my way
to this boys' level,

954
01:09:54,032 --> 01:09:56,578
the pool beneath the pool
beneath the pool,

955
01:09:56,618 --> 01:09:58,956
I always thought of the Forks
beneath the Forks,

956
01:09:58,996 --> 01:10:01,208
and a mystical power overtook me.

957
01:10:01,248 --> 01:10:06,254
Something shifted in my chest
the lower I went, a power shift.

958
01:10:06,294 --> 01:10:08,632
It was always rumoured
the water in the boys' pool

959
01:10:08,672 --> 01:10:11,802
came directly from the Forks
beneath the Forks.

960
01:10:11,842 --> 01:10:14,042
I believe that rumour.

961
01:10:14,761 --> 01:10:21,761
The two lower segregated levels of the pool
are closed now, since 1966.

962
01:10:23,103 --> 01:10:25,103
Why?

963
01:10:27,691 --> 01:10:29,691
What if? What if?

964
01:10:34,489 --> 01:10:37,289
"If Day"! February 19, 1942.

965
01:10:38,285 --> 01:10:43,041
At dawn, 5,000 Nazis invade Winnipeg
and declare martial law.

966
01:10:43,081 --> 01:10:48,004
Fascist officers arrest Mayor Queen,
Premier Bracken and his entire cabinet.

967
01:10:48,044 --> 01:10:52,801
Schoolteachers and politicians alike are
imprisoned in our historic lower Fort Garry,

968
01:10:52,841 --> 01:10:56,972
which is suddenly a concentration camp,
flying the swastika.

969
01:10:57,012 --> 01:11:00,809
By midmorning, Portage Avenue
is already renamed Hitlerstrasse.

970
01:11:00,849 --> 01:11:04,104
Winnipeg itself
is renamed Himmlerstadt.

971
01:11:04,144 --> 01:11:07,941
Citizens are bullied,
harassed, molested.

972
01:11:07,981 --> 01:11:10,581
What if? What if? What if?

973
01:11:11,735 --> 01:11:14,698
Talk about a terrifying detour
through time.

974
01:11:14,738 --> 01:11:18,410
For us here in Winnipeg,
where time cuts many pranks,

975
01:11:18,450 --> 01:11:21,851
this detour is horribly plausible.

976
01:11:22,037 --> 01:11:26,376
The 5,000 Nazis are actually
Rotary Club volunteers

977
01:11:26,416 --> 01:11:29,045
wearing costumes
rented from Hollywood,

978
01:11:29,085 --> 01:11:31,798
and "If Day" is a huge success,

979
01:11:31,838 --> 01:11:36,386
frightening Winnipeggers
into colossal war-bond purchases.

980
01:11:36,426 --> 01:11:40,827
To Winnipeggers,
the word "if" is terrifying.

981
01:11:40,889 --> 01:11:44,389
In Winnipeg, every day is "If Day",

982
01:11:44,726 --> 01:11:48,148
and one must be careful
when changing trains

983
01:11:48,188 --> 01:11:54,588
not to take the wrong line,
not to end up looping back endlessly.

984
01:11:55,445 --> 01:11:58,366
That's why one must stay awake
if he actually wants to get

985
01:11:58,406 --> 01:12:01,953
to where he thinks he's going,
to his Happyland.

986
01:12:01,993 --> 01:12:05,874
For time, for the wrathful nature
of this ancient land,

987
01:12:05,914 --> 01:12:10,615
plays one more trick upon him -
wrathful nature.

988
01:12:11,628 --> 01:12:15,133
Quickly, prairie herds descend
upon us again.

989
01:12:15,173 --> 01:12:18,428
From the plains of Silver Heights,
the pained cries rising

990
01:12:18,468 --> 01:12:22,640
from between two mating tilinkti,
or homosexual bulls,

991
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:26,436
held to be sacred for their double spirit
by the Ojibwe,

992
01:12:26,476 --> 01:12:29,647
spark a colossal buffalo stampede
down into Happyland,

993
01:12:29,687 --> 01:12:32,400
trampling the playground under hoof,

994
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:36,940
leaving it completely flat
within ten minutes.

995
01:12:37,362 --> 01:12:41,284
Then, a third stampede -
this one by our forgotten men -

996
01:12:41,324 --> 01:12:44,120
our veterans of the Great War.

997
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:47,760
Joined by our first nation's people,

998
01:12:48,039 --> 01:12:51,294
those swelling ranks
of our heartsick dispossessed,

999
01:12:51,334 --> 01:12:54,297
these souls descend onto
the devastation of Happyland

1000
01:12:54,337 --> 01:12:59,010
and sweep up every last piece of
happiness they can, for they need it.

1001
01:12:59,050 --> 01:13:02,847
Every fragment of plaything -
rollercoaster, arcade and Ferris wheel,

1002
01:13:02,887 --> 01:13:06,387
every last sliver of... happiness -

1003
01:13:06,808 --> 01:13:10,480
they remove it with the swiftness
of a starving man clearing his plate.

1004
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:13,691
These forgotten souls,
forgotten families, forgotten tribes

1005
01:13:13,731 --> 01:13:18,446
remove themselves and these odd spoils
to their secret homes upon the rooftops

1006
01:13:18,486 --> 01:13:23,326
to reconstitute, as well as they can
from this rubble, their own Happyland.

1007
01:13:23,366 --> 01:13:29,666
Out of sight, out of mind,
invisible, still there to this day...

1008
01:13:30,248 --> 01:13:32,648
still there to this day.

1009
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:34,875
Wrathful nature...

1010
01:13:35,253 --> 01:13:37,253
...benevolent bison.

1011
01:13:41,759 --> 01:13:45,223
For Winnipeg has always forbidden
the shantytowns and hobo villages

1012
01:13:45,263 --> 01:13:47,392
which typically pop up
in other cities.

1013
01:13:47,432 --> 01:13:50,561
Still on the books here is a law
which keeps our homeless out of sight,

1014
01:13:50,601 --> 01:13:56,776
up on the rooftops of our city, above us,
an aboriginal Happyland in the clouds.

1015
01:13:56,816 --> 01:13:58,903
Aboriginal Happyland...

1016
01:13:58,943 --> 01:14:00,943
forgotten Happyland.

1017
01:14:02,613 --> 01:14:05,613
Forgotten people... Happyland.

1018
01:14:09,078 --> 01:14:11,078
Happyland.

1019
01:14:19,589 --> 01:14:23,219
I'm near the edge of town now,
time running out.

1020
01:14:23,259 --> 01:14:27,390
I'm really going.
How will Winnipeg be without me?

1021
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:30,931
Who will look after
all its regrets?

1022
01:14:32,268 --> 01:14:35,369
I need to think of her as I go.

1023
01:14:35,730 --> 01:14:38,401
The Winnipeg Citizen
was a collective newspaper

1024
01:14:38,441 --> 01:14:41,404
that got the workers' word out
during the 1919 strike,

1025
01:14:41,444 --> 01:14:44,907
the only collective
daily paper in the world.

1026
01:14:44,947 --> 01:14:47,869
I know the Citizen never had
a Page Three Girl,

1027
01:14:47,909 --> 01:14:51,789
but if it had, she wouldn't be
just any tabloid pinup.

1028
01:14:51,829 --> 01:14:54,729
She would be... Citizen Girl!

1029
01:14:56,626 --> 01:14:59,881
A concerned comrade,
sad but strong,

1030
01:14:59,921 --> 01:15:02,258
strong enough to pry herself
from the inky pages

1031
01:15:02,298 --> 01:15:04,760
and climb to the very top
of our city

1032
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:08,598
to tend to those
in our aerial Happyland.

1033
01:15:08,638 --> 01:15:12,602
And from on high up in Happyland,
straddling our Forks from above,

1034
01:15:12,642 --> 01:15:18,774
she could undo all the damage done
during Winnipeg's first trip through time.

1035
01:15:18,814 --> 01:15:22,069
With one wave of her hand,
she could restore Eaton's,

1036
01:15:22,109 --> 01:15:25,448
the Jets and the arena,
my old arena home.

1037
01:15:25,488 --> 01:15:28,409
She would find a gentle forest
for the Black Tuesdays,

1038
01:15:28,449 --> 01:15:30,786
those wonderful old souls.

1039
01:15:30,826 --> 01:15:33,414
She would rename Minto
after Fred Dunsmore,

1040
01:15:33,454 --> 01:15:36,000
reopen all three levels
of the Sherbrooke Pool.

1041
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:40,463
Citizen Girl would plant a new sapling
right in the middle of Wolseley Avenue.

1042
01:15:40,503 --> 01:15:43,799
With one wave of the hand,
she would refill the Paddlewheel,

1043
01:15:43,839 --> 01:15:45,885
raise Whittier Park
from its ashes,

1044
01:15:45,925 --> 01:15:49,805
keep all our horses and schoolgirls
safe and right-minded,

1045
01:15:49,845 --> 01:15:53,643
and once again turn on the sign
at Clifford's.

1046
01:15:53,683 --> 01:15:57,772
She would look after this city,
my city, my Winnipeg.

1047
01:15:57,812 --> 01:16:00,816
She would be its new lap,
and then

1048
01:16:00,856 --> 01:16:03,444
I would know it was OK
to finally leave,

1049
01:16:03,484 --> 01:16:08,574
to leave the city in her hands -
secure, cared for, loved.

1050
01:16:08,614 --> 01:16:13,015
Then I could go to where
there are no ghosts.

1051
01:16:16,372 --> 01:16:18,167
Ghosts.

1052
01:16:18,207 --> 01:16:20,544
How can one live
without his ghosts?

1053
01:16:20,584 --> 01:16:23,297
What's a city
without its ghosts?

1054
01:16:23,337 --> 01:16:25,437
Unknown... unknown...

1055
01:16:27,508 --> 01:16:29,508
unknown.

1056
01:16:35,516 --> 01:16:38,020
I don't know what this experiment
did to my mother.

1057
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:41,232
She really developed an attachment
for my dead brother Cameron,

1058
01:16:41,272 --> 01:16:43,372
gone these 40 years -

1059
01:16:43,566 --> 01:16:47,466
or at least for Brandon,
who played him.

1060
01:16:48,904 --> 01:16:51,204
It's better between us.

1061
01:16:51,407 --> 01:16:53,407
Yes.

1062
01:16:53,492 --> 01:16:55,592
Now that you've gone.

1063
01:16:55,744 --> 01:16:59,044
I didn't used to like
being close.

1064
01:17:00,249 --> 01:17:02,249
Why?

1065
01:17:02,334 --> 01:17:04,934
I just wasn't comfortable.

1066
01:17:05,629 --> 01:17:08,029
Are you comfortable now?

1067
01:17:08,215 --> 01:17:10,315
Mostly, I guess I am.

1068
01:17:10,759 --> 01:17:12,759
Me too.

1069
01:17:14,096 --> 01:17:16,725
That Freezie wrapper looks sticky.

1070
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:19,465
I don't mind. I don't mind.

1071
01:17:23,063 --> 01:17:25,063
Who's alive?

1072
01:17:25,524 --> 01:17:27,524
Who is alive?

1073
01:17:27,610 --> 01:17:29,610
Who's alive anymore?

1074
01:17:31,572 --> 01:17:33,572
So hard to remember.

1075
01:17:33,616 --> 01:17:36,816
Sometimes... sometimes I forget.

1076
01:17:38,746 --> 01:17:42,247
I forget my brother Cameron
is gone.

1077
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:47,500
I forget my father's been gone
since I was 21.

1078
01:17:48,255 --> 01:17:50,634
At some point,
when you miss a place enough,

1079
01:17:50,674 --> 01:17:55,139
the backgrounds in photos become
more important than the people in them.

1080
01:17:55,179 --> 01:17:58,934
The old living room where we spent
almost every waking hour,

1081
01:17:58,974 --> 01:18:02,874
lying on couches
in front of the TV set.

1082
01:18:03,103 --> 01:18:05,103
My parents and I...

1083
01:18:06,815 --> 01:18:08,815
lying on couches,

1084
01:18:09,276 --> 01:18:11,276
lying on couches,

1085
01:18:12,279 --> 01:18:14,279
lying on couches.

1086
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:18,158
A chunk of home.

1087
01:18:20,162 --> 01:18:22,562
White... block... house.
