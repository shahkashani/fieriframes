1
00:03:27,922 --> 00:03:29,673
eXistenZ.

2
00:03:29,674 --> 00:03:31,007
Written like this.

3
00:03:31,008 --> 00:03:32,342
One word.

4
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,221
Small "e."
Capital "X."

5
00:03:36,055 --> 00:03:37,848
Capital "Z."

6
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,807
eXistenZ.

7
00:03:39,808 --> 00:03:43,061
It's new.
It's from Antenna Research.

8
00:03:43,062 --> 00:03:44,604
And it's here.

9
00:03:44,605 --> 00:03:46,481
Right now.

10
00:03:46,982 --> 00:03:50,192
We encourage consumer loyalty,
and we want you to help...

11
00:03:50,193 --> 00:03:54,281
...with our product testing.
We're a team. Antenna and you.

12
00:03:54,698 --> 00:03:57,534
Those of you who've come
to our seminars before...

13
00:03:57,535 --> 00:04:01,286
...will know that I normally lead
the groups through our new games.

14
00:04:01,287 --> 00:04:03,164
But tonight it won't be me.

15
00:04:03,165 --> 00:04:05,042
No.

16
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:09,003
For our test launch
of eXistenZ, by Antenna...

17
00:04:09,004 --> 00:04:12,340
...we've brought you
a seminar leader who's special.

18
00:04:14,093 --> 00:04:15,551
Yes, it is.

19
00:04:16,094 --> 00:04:19,430
The world's greatest
game designer is here...

20
00:04:19,431 --> 00:04:22,933
...in person, to lead you,
our first test enclave...

21
00:04:22,934 --> 00:04:27,312
...through her newest creation,
eXistenZ, by Antenna.

22
00:04:27,313 --> 00:04:30,774
I give you the game-pod
goddess herself...

23
00:04:30,775 --> 00:04:32,985
...Allegra Geller.

24
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:49,877
Allegra! Allegra!

25
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,014
The world of games
is in a kind of a trance.

26
00:05:02,557 --> 00:05:07,353
People are programmed
to accept so little.

27
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:12,817
But the possibilities are so great.

28
00:05:14,485 --> 00:05:19,073
eXistenZ is not just a game.

29
00:05:21,575 --> 00:05:23,994
It's an entirely new game system.

30
00:05:24,996 --> 00:05:26,413
And...

31
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,958
...it involves a whole lot
of new toys...

32
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,296
...which you're gonna be
the first to try out.

33
00:05:45,974 --> 00:05:49,477
We have 12 prototype
MetaFlesh Game-Pods.

34
00:05:49,478 --> 00:05:54,482
That means that for our first-wave
test enclave, we need 12 volunteers...

35
00:05:54,483 --> 00:05:59,279
...who will port into these slave units
with the game-pod goddess herself.

36
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:01,739
Hold it.

37
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,949
Not so fast.

38
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,743
Right.

39
00:06:06,912 --> 00:06:08,913
Did I miss the port-in?

40
00:06:08,914 --> 00:06:11,707
Just the first wave.
You can be part of the second.

41
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:14,502
You and the guy at the back.

42
00:06:14,503 --> 00:06:18,798
You, sir. This lady here.
Just come up. Thank you.

43
00:06:19,132 --> 00:06:21,258
Noel Dichter?

44
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:22,593
Yes.

45
00:06:23,095 --> 00:06:24,929
I have to scan you.

46
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,263
Weapons check?

47
00:06:26,848 --> 00:06:31,393
More for recording devices. Lot of
money invested in these games, Noel.

48
00:06:31,394 --> 00:06:35,398
Assistants will help you to port
your pod into your bio-ports...

49
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:37,775
...using Antenna Research's new...

50
00:06:37,984 --> 00:06:39,402
What's in this case?

51
00:06:39,403 --> 00:06:41,152
I brought my game-pod.

52
00:06:41,153 --> 00:06:46,199
Original Marway tissue architecture.
I know it's kind of obsolete.

53
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,954
I couldn't afford the Antenna 15 upgrade.
I figured out this method--

54
00:06:49,955 --> 00:06:52,081
You won't need it tonight.

55
00:06:52,915 --> 00:06:54,792
Everything's provided for.

56
00:07:04,677 --> 00:07:06,052
How are you doing?

57
00:07:06,053 --> 00:07:07,721
You think two hours, tops?

58
00:07:07,722 --> 00:07:09,932
Well, two, three hours.

59
00:07:10,308 --> 00:07:12,518
So you're saying three hours?

60
00:07:12,727 --> 00:07:14,061
Okay.

61
00:07:15,605 --> 00:07:18,356
Everything's in order.
Are you ready, Allegra?

62
00:07:18,357 --> 00:07:20,525
Sure. This is my favourite part.

63
00:07:20,526 --> 00:07:22,528
Take it away.

64
00:07:29,785 --> 00:07:31,619
All right.

65
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,208
I'm ready to download eXistenZ,
by Antenna Research, into all of you.

66
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:42,004
Now, I'm warning you,
it's going to be a wild ride.

67
00:07:42,005 --> 00:07:44,132
But don't panic.

68
00:07:44,133 --> 00:07:46,926
No matter what happens, okay?

69
00:07:47,844 --> 00:07:51,306
I'll see you back here
in no time at all.

70
00:08:23,755 --> 00:08:26,631
She seems to be very shy.

71
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:31,095
Never occurred to me
that a big star would be shy.

72
00:08:31,096 --> 00:08:35,182
She spends most of her time alone
in a room, designing her games.

73
00:08:35,183 --> 00:08:38,519
She'd like it best
if she never had to show them.

74
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:18,350
Death to the demoness
Allegra Geller!

75
00:09:24,023 --> 00:09:27,191
Death to Antenna Research!

76
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,880
Get her out of here.
Save her!

77
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:51,174
There might be more of them.
Go on!

78
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:54,219
- Me? Take her?
- We have enemies in our own house.

79
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,888
Trust no one. Trust no one!

80
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:16,450
Miss Geller, you're coming with me.

81
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:23,039
I'm responsible for you.
You're supposed to come with me.

82
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,077
Well, what are we
gonna do out here?

83
00:11:02,202 --> 00:11:05,873
Do you know your way around?
Do you know any country people?

84
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:09,834
Not country people.
Games people.

85
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:15,215
Countryside's full of games-development
people, project coordinators...

86
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,009
...little factories.

87
00:11:17,217 --> 00:11:20,345
So you know your way.
We can hide out.

88
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,806
Maybe.

89
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:26,017
It seems like I have some enemies
I didn't know I had.

90
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,353
" Death to Allegra Geller."

91
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,646
How would you like to hear
someone scream...

92
00:11:30,647 --> 00:11:33,400
..." Death to Ted Pikul"?

93
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,071
How'd you know my name?

94
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,281
You're labelled.

95
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,547
What's that?

96
00:11:57,798 --> 00:11:59,384
My pink-fone.

97
00:12:03,095 --> 00:12:04,430
Ted Pikul.

98
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,516
What hap--

99
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,851
What?

100
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,480
What did you do that for?

101
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,442
- That was our lifeline to civilization.
- That was a range-finder.

102
00:12:16,443 --> 00:12:19,569
As long as you have that,
they know where we are.

103
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,948
- You mean head office?
- Anybody.

104
00:12:27,578 --> 00:12:30,956
Pikul, why don't you have a gun?

105
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,500
What?

106
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,084
You're not armed.

107
00:12:34,085 --> 00:12:37,380
They told me you're my security,
but you have no weaponry.

108
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,631
Who told you that?

109
00:12:39,632 --> 00:12:41,717
I'm a marketing trainee.

110
00:12:45,263 --> 00:12:47,222
Fucking hell.

111
00:12:48,057 --> 00:12:53,227
I'm marked for death, and they send me
on the road with a PR nerd.

112
00:12:54,188 --> 00:12:56,398
" Marked for death."

113
00:12:57,108 --> 00:12:59,693
" Marked for death." Oh, Jesus.

114
00:13:01,112 --> 00:13:03,445
Don't sweat it, Pikul.

115
00:13:03,446 --> 00:13:05,740
Don't sweat it.
I'm gonna handle it.

116
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:09,452
And right now we need to stop.

117
00:13:10,037 --> 00:13:11,664
We do? Why?

118
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:16,168
So we can have an intimate
moment together.

119
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,935
If you're gonna do it, do it.

120
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,626
Did somebody bite you?

121
00:13:58,877 --> 00:14:00,211
What?

122
00:14:03,757 --> 00:14:06,259
What I just dug out of you.

123
00:14:07,594 --> 00:14:08,927
It's a tooth.

124
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:13,141
A human...

125
00:14:13,516 --> 00:14:15,268
...tooth.

126
00:14:19,814 --> 00:14:22,525
Let me see that weirdo pistol.

127
00:14:37,332 --> 00:14:41,084
The bullets are human teeth.

128
00:14:41,545 --> 00:14:44,004
This one's got a cavity.

129
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,802
That thing was designed to get past any
kind of metal or synthetics detector.

130
00:14:50,803 --> 00:14:52,346
It's all flesh and bone.

131
00:14:52,347 --> 00:14:56,891
I suppose the smaller calibre pistols
would have to fire baby teeth.

132
00:14:56,892 --> 00:15:00,562
The tooth fairy could go
into the arms business.

133
00:15:59,913 --> 00:16:02,123
Where were you just now?

134
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:06,043
I was wandering through eXistenZ.

135
00:16:06,044 --> 00:16:08,672
The new system, I mean.

136
00:16:09,923 --> 00:16:12,425
I like it in there.

137
00:16:13,343 --> 00:16:17,221
Of course, without another player
you're only a tourist.

138
00:16:18,056 --> 00:16:20,349
It's frustrating.

139
00:16:21,184 --> 00:16:23,811
Why won't you let me contact Antenna?

140
00:16:26,731 --> 00:16:30,776
They've gotta be going crazy
wondering what's happened to you.

141
00:16:32,153 --> 00:16:35,740
I mean, it's not like
we've done something wrong.

142
00:16:35,782 --> 00:16:40,118
We just ran because we didn't know
how many of them there were, right?

143
00:16:44,623 --> 00:16:48,502
We owe it to Antenna
to let them know you're all right...

144
00:16:50,128 --> 00:16:53,173
...and to get them to send
somebody to help you...

145
00:16:53,174 --> 00:16:55,175
...who knows what he's doing.

146
00:16:55,384 --> 00:16:58,428
Besides, I can't...

147
00:16:58,429 --> 00:17:02,349
I can't just keep doing this,
whatever it is...

148
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,185
...you know, forever.

149
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,481
Not having any idea when it's going--

150
00:17:10,941 --> 00:17:12,692
What are you doing?

151
00:17:12,693 --> 00:17:14,611
Where's your bio-port?

152
00:17:16,029 --> 00:17:18,698
Don't tell me you've
never been fitted.

153
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,575
I can't believe it.

154
00:17:20,576 --> 00:17:22,952
I was never fitted.
What do you care?

155
00:17:22,953 --> 00:17:26,873
You wanna get into the biz,
and you've never played my games?

156
00:17:31,336 --> 00:17:34,339
You've never played any game?

157
00:17:36,341 --> 00:17:37,801
Look.

158
00:17:39,594 --> 00:17:42,722
I've been dying to play your games...

159
00:17:43,724 --> 00:17:48,060
...but I have this phobia
about having my body penetrated...

160
00:17:48,061 --> 00:17:50,104
...surgically.

161
00:17:50,646 --> 00:17:52,941
You know what I mean.

162
00:17:53,984 --> 00:17:56,026
No, I'm not sure that I do.

163
00:17:56,027 --> 00:17:59,197
Getting a bio-port fitted.

164
00:18:00,323 --> 00:18:03,326
I don't know. I can't do it.

165
00:18:03,577 --> 00:18:06,286
It's too freaky.
Makes my skin crawl.

166
00:18:06,287 --> 00:18:09,706
They just pop your spine
with a little hydro-gun.

167
00:18:09,707 --> 00:18:11,959
They shoot the port plug into it.

168
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,544
It's like getting your ears pierced.

169
00:18:14,545 --> 00:18:18,466
With only an infinitesimal
chance of permanent spinal paralysis.

170
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:22,469
- I've read all about it.
- It's your chosen profession.

171
00:18:24,514 --> 00:18:27,016
Besides, once you're ported...

172
00:18:27,517 --> 00:18:30,394
...there's no end to the games
you can play.

173
00:18:30,603 --> 00:18:34,022
You can't seriously wanna
play games now.

174
00:18:34,023 --> 00:18:37,985
Not here. Not while we're being
hunted down by crazy people.

175
00:18:45,493 --> 00:18:49,745
My baby here took a huge hit
in the church, Pikul.

176
00:18:49,746 --> 00:18:52,874
One of those UmbyCords
got ripped out of her.

177
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,042
Ripped out of her.

178
00:18:55,043 --> 00:19:00,506
Just as the game architecture was being
downloaded from her to the slave pods.

179
00:19:01,466 --> 00:19:04,678
That's a very vulnerable time for her.

180
00:19:06,096 --> 00:19:10,182
She could be crying out
for help right here...

181
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:12,226
...right now.

182
00:19:13,187 --> 00:19:16,355
The only way I can tell...

183
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:19,276
...if the game's
not been contaminated...

184
00:19:19,443 --> 00:19:24,907
...the pod is not about to be crippled
for life because of my negligence...

185
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:30,328
...is to play eXistenZ...

186
00:19:30,704 --> 00:19:33,456
...with somebody friendly.

187
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:38,044
Are you friendly?

188
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:40,963
Or are you not?

189
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:46,386
Sure.

190
00:19:49,514 --> 00:19:51,391
Let's do it.

191
00:19:52,434 --> 00:19:54,143
Let's do it now.

192
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:56,979
Let me see.

193
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,607
To get an illegal...

194
00:19:59,608 --> 00:20:02,610
...unregistered bio-port installed...

195
00:20:02,611 --> 00:20:05,988
...at about midnight...

196
00:20:06,197 --> 00:20:10,076
...we just drive up to your local
country gas station, right?

197
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:25,048
Anything else I can do for you?

198
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:26,717
Well, Gas...

199
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:30,096
...you could check
your bio-port plugs.

200
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:32,639
The what? Spark plugs?

201
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,141
You heard me.

202
00:20:34,142 --> 00:20:37,894
My friend here
has a bio-port problem.

203
00:20:37,895 --> 00:20:40,231
A bio-port. Now...

204
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,985
...that's a sort of hole
in your spine, isn't it?

205
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,573
Lots of assholes around here,
but that's generally it.

206
00:20:52,701 --> 00:20:56,288
I don't know why you'd be
talking to me about that, lady.

207
00:20:57,706 --> 00:21:00,000
Sure you do.

208
00:21:21,771 --> 00:21:23,982
Allegra Geller.

209
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:26,692
You've changed my life.

210
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,656
What was your life like before?

211
00:21:31,906 --> 00:21:33,616
Before?

212
00:21:34,618 --> 00:21:37,244
Before it was changed
by Allegra Geller.

213
00:21:37,745 --> 00:21:40,248
I operated a gas station.

214
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,959
You still operate a gas station.

215
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:48,422
Only on the most pathetic
level of reality.

216
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:51,717
Geller's work liberated me.

217
00:21:51,801 --> 00:21:53,219
Liberated?

218
00:21:53,303 --> 00:21:55,429
Did you ever play her game ArtGod?

219
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,848
One word. Capital "A."
Capital "G."

220
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,809
I don't have a bio-port.

221
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:06,231
"Thou, the player of the game, art God."
Very spiritual.

222
00:22:06,274 --> 00:22:08,401
Funny too.

223
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:12,863
God, the artist, the mechanic.

224
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:14,240
Funny.

225
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:20,538
Here we go.

226
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,130
Those are sterilized...

227
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:31,422
...aren't they?

228
00:22:31,423 --> 00:22:32,715
Not to worry.

229
00:22:32,716 --> 00:22:36,552
You could fire in a bio-port
in a slaughterhouse...

230
00:22:36,553 --> 00:22:39,473
...and never generate an infection.

231
00:22:39,474 --> 00:22:42,058
Then why the clean overalls?

232
00:22:45,104 --> 00:22:46,562
It's a mental thing.

233
00:22:46,563 --> 00:22:48,648
Helps me focus.

234
00:22:48,649 --> 00:22:53,903
The one thing you don't wanna do
is miss with the stud-finder.

235
00:22:55,697 --> 00:22:56,739
Oh, God.

236
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,074
God?

237
00:22:58,534 --> 00:23:00,327
The mechanic.

238
00:23:02,204 --> 00:23:04,748
Step into my office.

239
00:24:36,254 --> 00:24:38,924
See? That didn't hurt, did it?

240
00:24:38,925 --> 00:24:41,343
I didn't expect that to hurt.

241
00:24:42,302 --> 00:24:44,513
I expect the next part to hurt.

242
00:24:50,728 --> 00:24:52,853
That's what I expect to hurt.

243
00:24:52,854 --> 00:24:55,441
I haven't crippled anyone yet.

244
00:24:56,275 --> 00:24:57,775
How many have you done?

245
00:24:57,776 --> 00:24:59,235
Three.

246
00:25:00,112 --> 00:25:03,406
Well, you'll be my third.

247
00:25:28,557 --> 00:25:30,099
Easy.

248
00:25:31,184 --> 00:25:33,477
- What was going on, Gas?
- Hell...

249
00:25:33,478 --> 00:25:36,688
...he's acting
like I'm attacking him.

250
00:25:36,689 --> 00:25:39,191
People usually pay me to do this.

251
00:25:39,192 --> 00:25:41,527
Yeah? All two of them!

252
00:25:42,278 --> 00:25:43,821
As you can see...

253
00:25:43,822 --> 00:25:46,866
...I've decided not to have
a bio-port installed.

254
00:25:59,671 --> 00:26:01,838
This is it, you see.

255
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:04,424
This is the cage of your own making...

256
00:26:04,425 --> 00:26:09,888
...which keeps you trapped and pacing
about in the smallest space forever.

257
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,642
Break out of your cage, Pikul.

258
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,771
Break out now.

259
00:26:28,866 --> 00:26:31,242
The swelling doesn't last for long.

260
00:26:31,243 --> 00:26:33,870
Tomorrow you won't even notice it.

261
00:26:35,539 --> 00:26:37,415
I love it.

262
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:39,710
Great.

263
00:26:44,006 --> 00:26:47,132
What's going on?
I can't move my legs!

264
00:26:47,133 --> 00:26:48,635
The procedure comes...

265
00:26:48,636 --> 00:26:50,428
...with its own epidural.

266
00:26:50,429 --> 00:26:53,180
Just like when you have a baby.

267
00:26:53,181 --> 00:26:56,559
Kind of instant paralysis
from the waist down.

268
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,895
That's why it didn't hurt you.

269
00:26:58,896 --> 00:27:01,106
It'll wear off in no time.

270
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:04,943
I'm gonna go wash up.

271
00:27:04,944 --> 00:27:08,821
You two make yourselves at home.

272
00:27:20,543 --> 00:27:24,128
We don't have to wait
for the swelling to go down.

273
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,013
You're gonna port into me
while I'm paralysed?

274
00:27:35,557 --> 00:27:38,309
You wanted to play my game,
didn't you?

275
00:27:38,685 --> 00:27:41,562
Yeah, I did. I do, but--

276
00:27:41,646 --> 00:27:43,438
Here? Now?

277
00:27:43,439 --> 00:27:46,233
It's an instant-on world, isn't it?

278
00:27:47,484 --> 00:27:49,278
What's that for?

279
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,321
Feels...

280
00:27:51,322 --> 00:27:52,657
...cold.

281
00:27:53,533 --> 00:27:56,911
New ports are sometimes
a bit tight.

282
00:27:57,661 --> 00:27:59,789
Wouldn't wanna hurt you.

283
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,958
How come...

284
00:28:04,377 --> 00:28:07,712
...bio-ports don't get infected?

285
00:28:07,713 --> 00:28:09,589
I mean...

286
00:28:11,259 --> 00:28:14,386
...they open right
into your body.

287
00:28:16,598 --> 00:28:21,477
Listen to what you're saying, Pikul.
Don't be ludicrous.

288
00:28:32,946 --> 00:28:36,241
Don't you think
you could call me Ted?

289
00:28:36,618 --> 00:28:39,202
Maybe afterwards.

290
00:29:09,858 --> 00:29:11,859
Shit!

291
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,193
Pikul!

292
00:29:13,569 --> 00:29:15,154
I can't believe it.

293
00:29:15,155 --> 00:29:16,531
You blew my pod!

294
00:29:17,449 --> 00:29:18,990
You neural-surged.

295
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:20,034
What do you mean?

296
00:29:20,035 --> 00:29:22,996
I jacked you into my pod
and you panicked.

297
00:29:23,371 --> 00:29:25,122
It's totally fucked!

298
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,584
This is a disaster.

299
00:29:28,084 --> 00:29:31,129
I was nervous,
but I didn't panic.

300
00:29:31,755 --> 00:29:36,717
I was forced to trust you, and you
panicked and you neural-surged...

301
00:29:36,718 --> 00:29:38,594
...and you blew my pod.

302
00:29:39,345 --> 00:29:41,388
You can get a new pod.

303
00:29:42,266 --> 00:29:43,599
Pikul.

304
00:29:44,684 --> 00:29:46,978
In this pod...

305
00:29:46,979 --> 00:29:51,523
...is the only, the original
version of eXistenZ.

306
00:29:51,524 --> 00:29:55,485
An entire game system that cost
38 million to develop.

307
00:29:55,486 --> 00:29:58,155
Not including prerelease
marketing costs.

308
00:29:58,156 --> 00:30:01,449
And I'm locked outside my own game.

309
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,578
I can't get me in or it out.

310
00:30:05,204 --> 00:30:10,000
Are you serious?
That's the only version that exists?

311
00:30:10,126 --> 00:30:13,210
It's the only one
and it's stuck inside...

312
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:15,964
...and it's your fault.

313
00:30:19,927 --> 00:30:25,349
I've devoted five of my most passionate
years to this strange little creature.

314
00:30:27,768 --> 00:30:30,561
And I've never regretted it, Pikul.

315
00:30:31,606 --> 00:30:36,025
I knew it was the only thing
that could give my life any meaning.

316
00:30:38,987 --> 00:30:41,322
Why is it my fault?

317
00:30:41,824 --> 00:30:43,908
I'm telling you, I didn't.

318
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:45,576
I did not neural-surge.

319
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:46,786
I didn't.

320
00:30:46,787 --> 00:30:49,288
I didn't feel any surging.

321
00:30:49,623 --> 00:30:51,290
It's not your fault.

322
00:30:53,044 --> 00:30:55,169
It's my fault.

323
00:30:56,838 --> 00:30:59,090
Oh, no, Gas. Not you.

324
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:02,468
I wouldn't try to use
that bio-port again.

325
00:31:02,469 --> 00:31:06,014
Except maybe for a toaster
or something.

326
00:31:07,808 --> 00:31:09,684
What's going on?

327
00:31:10,477 --> 00:31:14,897
You're worth a lot of money
if you're dead.

328
00:31:14,981 --> 00:31:16,232
What are you talking about?

329
00:31:16,233 --> 00:31:20,569
You know what I'm talking about.
It's all over the countryside.

330
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:25,241
Five million dollars for her dead body.
No questions asked.

331
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:30,704
But she changed your life.

332
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:32,373
Yeah.

333
00:31:32,707 --> 00:31:34,624
Now I'm gonna change hers.

334
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:39,671
Why did you install
a bad port into me?

335
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:41,966
There's a bonus for killing...

336
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:46,929
...Allegra Geller's latest game,
or whatever it is.

337
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:49,931
I think I just did that, didn't I?

338
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:56,897
But can you kill me, Gas?
Can you kill a person?

339
00:31:57,732 --> 00:31:59,608
Can you do that?

340
00:32:00,442 --> 00:32:01,985
Hide my body...

341
00:32:02,863 --> 00:32:05,447
...contact the crazies...

342
00:32:05,573 --> 00:32:08,158
...trust them to pay up?

343
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:11,620
Hand over my now decaying,
fucking grotesque corpse...

344
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:15,666
...really expect them to hand over
five mill cash?

345
00:32:16,208 --> 00:32:20,253
I mean, don't you ever go
to the fucking movies?

346
00:32:21,589 --> 00:32:24,215
I like your script.

347
00:32:27,052 --> 00:32:29,261
I wanna be in it.

348
00:32:54,621 --> 00:32:57,791
Oh, God, I think he's dead.

349
00:33:01,002 --> 00:33:03,422
He wanted to kill you.

350
00:33:08,803 --> 00:33:11,762
That's two people in one day...

351
00:33:11,763 --> 00:33:14,682
...who wanted to actually kill you.

352
00:33:15,517 --> 00:33:18,436
I've never been more popular.

353
00:33:18,854 --> 00:33:20,980
Allegra, we need help.

354
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:26,777
You're right. I've gotta
get this pod fixed.

355
00:33:49,091 --> 00:33:51,051
We're going skiing?

356
00:34:08,903 --> 00:34:11,237
Look at that huge bug.

357
00:34:11,572 --> 00:34:13,824
It's got two heads.

358
00:34:13,825 --> 00:34:18,162
It's not a bug. it's a mutated
amphibian. it's a frog...

359
00:34:18,163 --> 00:34:21,373
...salamander-lizard thing.

360
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,708
Sign of the times.

361
00:34:31,925 --> 00:34:35,928
What happens if somebody comes up here
and really wants to ski?

362
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:40,642
Nobody actually physically
skis anymore. You know that.

363
00:34:52,446 --> 00:34:54,488
No, don't use that!

364
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:57,492
And bring me the sterile wash.

365
00:35:01,245 --> 00:35:03,873
My darling.

366
00:35:10,213 --> 00:35:12,924
Allegra Geller.

367
00:35:14,176 --> 00:35:16,468
I am so pleased...

368
00:35:16,469 --> 00:35:20,430
...and so astonished to see you here.

369
00:35:20,431 --> 00:35:21,973
Kiri Vinokur...

370
00:35:21,974 --> 00:35:24,352
...my bodyguard, Ted Pikul.

371
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,355
Sterile wash.

372
00:35:30,316 --> 00:35:32,484
I hear this ridiculous story...

373
00:35:32,485 --> 00:35:35,654
...about some fatwa against you.

374
00:35:35,655 --> 00:35:38,990
The company are desperately
trying to find you.

375
00:35:38,991 --> 00:35:42,036
Is this really serious?
Are you in danger?

376
00:35:42,537 --> 00:35:45,413
There have been a couple
of attempts on my life.

377
00:35:45,414 --> 00:35:48,166
This is unbearable.
The company must stop this.

378
00:35:48,167 --> 00:35:50,836
They owe you every kind
of protection.

379
00:35:50,837 --> 00:35:55,673
I don't know if they can do anything.
It seems to be open season on me.

380
00:35:56,509 --> 00:35:58,677
You're safe here.
I assure you.

381
00:35:59,303 --> 00:36:03,598
I will contact Antenna right away
and have them send some people over--

382
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,267
No, Kiri, don't.

383
00:36:06,268 --> 00:36:07,936
Tell no one we're here.

384
00:36:07,937 --> 00:36:11,605
I can't be sure that Antenna
is completely safe for me.

385
00:36:11,606 --> 00:36:13,317
I understand. Yes.

386
00:36:13,943 --> 00:36:15,693
You know...

387
00:36:16,444 --> 00:36:20,239
...you can hide out in one
of the guest chalets...

388
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,659
...as long as you like.

389
00:36:23,578 --> 00:36:26,704
And I'll make sure
you get fresh towels.

390
00:36:27,581 --> 00:36:31,209
And make sure I don't lose everything
I have in here.

391
00:36:32,586 --> 00:36:34,421
You bet.

392
00:36:46,516 --> 00:36:48,643
Take that.

393
00:36:49,603 --> 00:36:50,937
Good.

394
00:36:54,149 --> 00:36:56,985
Pull this back.

395
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:00,654
What did you port into?

396
00:37:02,157 --> 00:37:03,657
Pikul's bio-port.

397
00:37:03,658 --> 00:37:06,661
That's what caused
all the damage?

398
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:10,998
It was a flawed installation.
My first.

399
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:13,126
Well...

400
00:37:14,795 --> 00:37:16,878
...it fried a lot of expensive...

401
00:37:16,879 --> 00:37:18,839
...neural webbing.

402
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,423
You see?

403
00:37:20,424 --> 00:37:23,052
Looks like an animal in there.

404
00:37:23,595 --> 00:37:27,139
Feels like you're operating
on somebody's pet dog.

405
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,225
I told you, Landry,
we have become...

406
00:37:30,226 --> 00:37:32,894
...glorified veterinarians.

407
00:37:33,396 --> 00:37:35,772
Put a little in there, please.

408
00:37:39,945 --> 00:37:44,114
The eXistenZ game-pod is basically
an animal, Mr. Pikul.

409
00:37:44,616 --> 00:37:50,246
It's grown from fertilized amphibian
eggs stuffed with synthetic DNA.

410
00:37:50,871 --> 00:37:52,873
Only Antenna has this.

411
00:37:53,332 --> 00:37:56,960
Wow. Where do the batteries go?

412
00:37:58,504 --> 00:38:00,130
Very funny.

413
00:38:01,173 --> 00:38:02,966
He's not kidding.

414
00:38:02,967 --> 00:38:08,263
He's a total PR nerd. it ports
into you. You're the power source.

415
00:38:08,389 --> 00:38:12,600
Your body, your nervous system,
your metabolism, your energy.

416
00:38:12,601 --> 00:38:16,145
You get tired, rundown,
it won't run properly.

417
00:38:19,775 --> 00:38:23,945
Iandry here will finish up
the pod work. Now, let's...

418
00:38:23,946 --> 00:38:27,908
...get that nasty bio-port out,
put a nice fresh one in.

419
00:38:35,207 --> 00:38:36,957
It hurts.

420
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,793
I think it's infected.

421
00:38:38,794 --> 00:38:41,462
No, it's not infected.

422
00:38:42,755 --> 00:38:45,008
It's just excited.

423
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:48,552
It wants action.

424
00:38:48,553 --> 00:38:51,680
I really don't think
I want action. Me, I mean.

425
00:38:51,681 --> 00:38:54,809
The bearer of the excited bio-port.

426
00:38:58,271 --> 00:39:03,317
My baby has now taken three major hits.
One in the church...

427
00:39:03,318 --> 00:39:06,987
...one in the gas station
and one on the operating table.

428
00:39:06,988 --> 00:39:10,366
The only way I can tell
if everything's okay...

429
00:39:10,783 --> 00:39:15,454
...is to play eXistenZ
with somebody friendly.

430
00:39:15,663 --> 00:39:20,459
Are you friendly or are you not?

431
00:39:24,297 --> 00:39:27,716
You're telling me this thing
will run off my body's energy?

432
00:39:27,717 --> 00:39:30,052
That's how they work.

433
00:39:31,887 --> 00:39:35,891
See? You're humming along already.

434
00:39:38,937 --> 00:39:40,813
EXistenZ.

435
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,775
Only from Antenna.

436
00:39:44,776 --> 00:39:46,735
Here we go.

437
00:39:47,486 --> 00:39:50,197
You've got a bit
of an unfair advantage.

438
00:39:50,198 --> 00:39:55,703
How can I possibly compete
with the designer of the system?

439
00:39:55,911 --> 00:39:59,623
Well, you could...

440
00:39:59,624 --> 00:40:03,001
...beat the guy that
invented poker, couldn't you?

441
00:40:25,941 --> 00:40:28,568
- You want that one?
- Yeah, that one.

442
00:40:28,569 --> 00:40:31,403
- Are you sure you want that one?
- Yes.

443
00:40:31,404 --> 00:40:33,865
- I wouldn't recommend it.
- Why not?

444
00:40:33,866 --> 00:40:38,035
The graphics on this one are better.
There's no comparison.

445
00:40:38,412 --> 00:40:41,163
- This is the one you want.
- That one?

446
00:40:41,164 --> 00:40:43,457
That was beautiful.

447
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:54,093
I feel just like me.

448
00:40:54,386 --> 00:40:56,971
Is that kind of transition normal?

449
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:02,809
That kind of smooth interlacing
from place to place?

450
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:04,937
Depends on the style of the game.

451
00:41:04,938 --> 00:41:08,857
You can get jagged brutal cuts,
slow fades...

452
00:41:09,609 --> 00:41:12,236
...shimmering little morphs.

453
00:41:15,281 --> 00:41:16,991
This is amazing.

454
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:21,412
I had no idea.

455
00:41:24,332 --> 00:41:27,668
Look at this.
Games I've never heard of.

456
00:41:28,002 --> 00:41:29,336
Wait a minute.

457
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:31,505
That reminds me.

458
00:41:31,964 --> 00:41:36,635
What precisely is the goal of the game
that we're playing now?

459
00:41:37,052 --> 00:41:42,515
You have to play the game to find out
why you're playing the game.

460
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:45,102
It's the future, Pikul.

461
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:48,731
You'll see how natural it feels.

462
00:42:13,505 --> 00:42:14,839
Look at this.

463
00:42:20,303 --> 00:42:23,889
Can this be the future too?
Ever see anything like this before?

464
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:26,184
These are delicate.

465
00:42:26,269 --> 00:42:27,351
You got to be...

466
00:42:27,352 --> 00:42:29,062
...careful.

467
00:42:30,021 --> 00:42:31,648
Yes, I can imagine.

468
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:33,315
Cortical Systematics...

469
00:42:33,316 --> 00:42:37,111
...is the latest and the hottest.
Not just a new game...

470
00:42:37,112 --> 00:42:39,280
...but a new system.

471
00:42:39,739 --> 00:42:43,368
Will it work with an industry
standard bio-port?

472
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:45,578
I'm D'Arcy Nader.

473
00:42:46,413 --> 00:42:51,083
Welcome to D'Arcy Nader's
Game Emporium.

474
00:42:51,084 --> 00:42:55,129
Is there anything I can be
helping you with?

475
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:57,881
We're just looking.

476
00:43:02,553 --> 00:43:04,847
I have...

477
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:07,308
...what you're looking for.

478
00:43:10,061 --> 00:43:11,938
Who sent you?

479
00:43:14,315 --> 00:43:16,734
It's none of your business
who sent us.

480
00:43:16,735 --> 00:43:18,276
We're here.

481
00:43:18,277 --> 00:43:20,278
That's all that matters.

482
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:24,116
God.

483
00:43:24,825 --> 00:43:26,744
What happened?

484
00:43:28,204 --> 00:43:30,706
I didn't mean to say that.

485
00:43:30,998 --> 00:43:32,999
Your character said it.

486
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,085
It's a kind of schizophrenic feeling,
isn't it?

487
00:43:36,086 --> 00:43:37,670
You'll get used to it.

488
00:43:37,671 --> 00:43:41,299
There are things that have to be said
to advance the plot.

489
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:44,677
Those things get said whether
you wanna say them or not.

490
00:43:44,678 --> 00:43:45,929
Don't fight it.

491
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:48,223
Just go with it.

492
00:43:48,516 --> 00:43:51,852
But should you be saying this
in front of him?

493
00:43:55,105 --> 00:43:56,606
Look at him.

494
00:44:03,029 --> 00:44:06,241
- What's he doing?
- He's gone into a game loop.

495
00:44:06,992 --> 00:44:11,663
He won't come out of it until you give
him a proper line of game dialogue.

496
00:44:15,334 --> 00:44:17,419
This is tricky.

497
00:44:18,545 --> 00:44:20,880
Start by repeating your last line.

498
00:44:20,881 --> 00:44:24,300
Include his name so he knows
you're talking to him.

499
00:44:29,514 --> 00:44:31,725
We're here, D'Arcy Nader...

500
00:44:32,433 --> 00:44:34,935
...and that's all that matters.

501
00:44:34,936 --> 00:44:39,732
Yes, you're right.
That is all that matters.

502
00:44:43,611 --> 00:44:47,658
Now, you said you have
what we want.

503
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:49,742
We're waiting.

504
00:44:50,243 --> 00:44:53,370
You're going to need
these micro-pods...

505
00:44:53,371 --> 00:44:55,998
...to download your new identities.

506
00:44:56,749 --> 00:44:59,627
I assume that you both
have had these...

507
00:45:00,086 --> 00:45:02,545
...industry standard bio-ports...

508
00:45:02,546 --> 00:45:05,257
...that you mentioned installed.

509
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,010
Yes, of course,
we both have bio-ports.

510
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:13,473
We do, don't we?

511
00:45:13,557 --> 00:45:15,017
I assumed we did.

512
00:45:18,103 --> 00:45:20,398
In the game, we might not.

513
00:45:21,024 --> 00:45:22,775
We better check.

514
00:45:24,193 --> 00:45:25,694
Yeah, it's there.

515
00:45:25,695 --> 00:45:28,613
Looks a little different,
but it's there.

516
00:45:31,785 --> 00:45:34,160
Yeah, I see what you mean.

517
00:45:34,953 --> 00:45:38,164
Yes, we both have bio-ports.

518
00:45:38,749 --> 00:45:40,083
Good.

519
00:45:41,043 --> 00:45:42,794
Port in.

520
00:45:42,795 --> 00:45:47,299
And this will tell you
all you need to know...

521
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,133
...for now.

522
00:45:49,134 --> 00:45:54,764
I'm going to leave, while you two
finish up here because...

523
00:45:55,724 --> 00:46:00,729
...it wouldn't be good for us all
to be seen together.

524
00:46:09,321 --> 00:46:13,031
I assume that Nader is our
entry point into the game.

525
00:46:13,032 --> 00:46:16,035
Yeah, kind of disappointing.

526
00:46:16,036 --> 00:46:17,120
Nader?

527
00:46:17,121 --> 00:46:21,707
He's not a very well-drawn character.
His dialogue was just so-so.

528
00:46:21,708 --> 00:46:23,043
His accent...

529
00:46:37,474 --> 00:46:40,434
The pods are so small...

530
00:46:40,685 --> 00:46:44,438
...they plug directly
into the bio-port.

531
00:46:55,616 --> 00:46:56,658
Oh, God.

532
00:46:56,659 --> 00:46:57,994
What happened?

533
00:46:59,036 --> 00:47:04,208
The whole pod just disappeared
into your back.

534
00:47:04,625 --> 00:47:06,543
It disappeared into my back?

535
00:47:06,544 --> 00:47:09,337
It's working its way
round my spinal cord?

536
00:47:09,338 --> 00:47:11,673
Don't panic. it's just a game.

537
00:47:11,674 --> 00:47:13,841
Do you feel anything yet?

538
00:47:16,137 --> 00:47:18,013
No, I don't.

539
00:47:18,139 --> 00:47:20,724
Not a thing.
I don't feel a thing.

540
00:47:22,977 --> 00:47:25,104
Do you want me to do you?

541
00:48:03,267 --> 00:48:05,351
What the hell was that?

542
00:48:06,561 --> 00:48:10,272
That wasn't me.
It was my game character.

543
00:48:10,273 --> 00:48:13,484
I wouldn't have done that.
Not here anyway.

544
00:48:31,545 --> 00:48:35,590
Our characters are obviously
supposed to jump on each other.

545
00:48:36,299 --> 00:48:37,967
It's most probably...

546
00:48:39,301 --> 00:48:42,471
...a pathetically
mechanical attempt...

547
00:48:42,472 --> 00:48:47,060
...to heighten the emotional tension
of the next game sequence.

548
00:48:56,444 --> 00:48:58,154
No use fighting it.

549
00:48:58,321 --> 00:49:02,366
What about our new identities?

550
00:49:02,367 --> 00:49:04,785
Do you feel yours yet?

551
00:49:05,077 --> 00:49:07,914
They'll take care of themselves.

552
00:49:14,545 --> 00:49:17,297
I'm very worried about my body.

553
00:49:17,465 --> 00:49:19,591
Your what?

554
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,055
Where are our real bodies?

555
00:49:25,347 --> 00:49:27,098
Are they all right?

556
00:49:27,099 --> 00:49:30,018
What if they're hungry?
What if there's danger?

557
00:49:32,188 --> 00:49:34,939
They're just where we left them.

558
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:37,525
They're sitting quietly...

559
00:49:37,526 --> 00:49:39,610
...eyes closed.

560
00:49:43,699 --> 00:49:46,493
It's just like meditating.

561
00:49:52,625 --> 00:49:54,625
I feel really vulnerable.

562
00:49:55,668 --> 00:49:57,671
Disembodied.

563
00:50:03,469 --> 00:50:05,678
Don't sweat it.

564
00:50:10,767 --> 00:50:14,438
All your senses
are still operating.

565
00:50:18,609 --> 00:50:22,361
You'll pop right out
of the game if there's a problem.

566
00:51:00,858 --> 00:51:03,569
Trying to remember who you are?

567
00:51:05,946 --> 00:51:10,241
Hey, it works!
I must be Yevgeny Nourish.

568
00:51:10,242 --> 00:51:12,787
And you are new to trout farm.

569
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,206
Yes, I'm...

570
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:19,500
I'm very new.

571
00:51:19,501 --> 00:51:21,294
Did you say "trout farm"?

572
00:51:22,004 --> 00:51:24,006
Yeah, trout farm.

573
00:51:24,007 --> 00:51:28,635
You know, raising baby trout from eggs
and releasing them in rivers.

574
00:51:28,636 --> 00:51:31,471
Entire place used to be trout farm.

575
00:51:31,472 --> 00:51:37,102
From outside, you would never guess
it's now factory for making game-pods.

576
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:41,815
Seems like most everything
used to be something else, yes?

577
00:51:49,364 --> 00:51:52,575
You're new, but you seem
to know what you're doing.

578
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:55,996
It surprises me more
than it surprises you.

579
00:51:59,624 --> 00:52:03,128
You're new, but you seem
to know what you're doing.

580
00:52:31,948 --> 00:52:34,659
I've been trained by the very best.

581
00:52:38,872 --> 00:52:43,125
So have I, my friend.
So have I.

582
00:52:43,417 --> 00:52:46,670
Where are you planning
to have lunch?

583
00:52:49,716 --> 00:52:51,675
I'm new here.

584
00:52:52,885 --> 00:52:55,428
I have no plans for lunch.

585
00:52:56,139 --> 00:53:00,057
May I suggest the Chinese restaurant
in the forest?

586
00:53:00,058 --> 00:53:03,979
Everyone knows where it is.
Just ask.

587
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:08,567
Well, won't you be going there too?

588
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:11,695
Unfortunately, I have
other plans for lunch.

589
00:53:11,696 --> 00:53:14,239
But I do suggest
you order the special.

590
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,534
And don't take no for answer.

591
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:21,496
All right, I'll do that.

592
00:53:30,255 --> 00:53:31,673
Iarry.

593
00:53:33,634 --> 00:53:34,969
Yes?

594
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:38,596
They need this in the back.
They asked for you.

595
00:54:58,968 --> 00:55:03,471
I saw you make contact, Larry. What
did the guy on the assembly line say?

596
00:55:03,472 --> 00:55:06,432
Can you believe the game version
of your pod?

597
00:55:06,433 --> 00:55:07,768
It's sick...

598
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:11,771
...and so unconvincing! I mean,
using mutated animal organs...

599
00:55:11,772 --> 00:55:16,400
...and nervous systems as game-pod parts
is certainly feasible...

600
00:55:16,986 --> 00:55:19,071
...but everything's so dirty.

601
00:55:19,447 --> 00:55:21,073
Absurd.

602
00:55:21,615 --> 00:55:23,241
Grotesque.

603
00:55:34,128 --> 00:55:39,549
I saw you make contact, Larry. What
did the guy on the assembly line say?

604
00:55:43,094 --> 00:55:46,847
He told me where to have lunch.

605
00:56:28,223 --> 00:56:31,766
We have nice sea bass today.

606
00:56:31,767 --> 00:56:34,687
Shall I bring it for everyone?

607
00:56:35,396 --> 00:56:37,397
We want the special.

608
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:51,369
Did you hear me, Chinese waiter?

609
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:54,373
We want the special.

610
00:56:55,041 --> 00:57:00,671
The special is for special occasions.
I cannot give you the special.

611
00:57:04,299 --> 00:57:09,721
But this is a special occasion.

612
00:57:10,765 --> 00:57:13,058
It's her birthday.

613
00:57:15,770 --> 00:57:19,355
A birthday is a special occasion.

614
00:57:19,356 --> 00:57:23,276
I will therefore bring the special
for everybody.

615
00:57:32,619 --> 00:57:35,371
I guess the special
isn't very popular.

616
00:57:35,372 --> 00:57:37,206
I guess not.

617
00:57:46,382 --> 00:57:48,927
I wanna put the game on pause.

618
00:57:50,929 --> 00:57:53,472
The game can be paused, can't it?

619
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,851
I mean, all games
can be paused, right?

620
00:57:56,934 --> 00:57:59,854
Yeah, sure. But why? What's wrong?

621
00:57:59,855 --> 00:58:03,941
Aren't you dying to see
what's so special about the special?

622
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:09,029
I'm feeling a little disconnected
from my real life.

623
00:58:09,113 --> 00:58:11,865
I'm losing touch
with the texture of it.

624
00:58:11,866 --> 00:58:14,159
You know what I mean?
I actually think...

625
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,871
...there's an element
of psychosis involved here.

626
00:58:19,665 --> 00:58:21,250
This is a great sign.

627
00:58:21,251 --> 00:58:25,421
Your nervous system is fully
engaging with the game architecture.

628
00:58:29,592 --> 00:58:33,012
EXistenZ is paused!

629
00:58:46,775 --> 00:58:48,986
Did I do that?

630
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,364
I guess I did.

631
00:58:54,408 --> 00:58:56,452
So how does it feel?

632
00:58:56,993 --> 00:58:58,328
What?

633
00:59:02,082 --> 00:59:04,250
Your real life.

634
00:59:04,585 --> 00:59:07,044
The one you came back for.

635
00:59:07,045 --> 00:59:09,840
It feels completely unreal.

636
00:59:10,007 --> 00:59:13,384
You're stuck now, aren't you?

637
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,804
You wanna go back
to the Chinese restaurant...

638
00:59:16,805 --> 00:59:19,849
...because there's
nothing happening here.

639
00:59:19,975 --> 00:59:23,186
We're safe. it's boring.

640
00:59:26,232 --> 00:59:28,608
It's worse than that.

641
00:59:39,244 --> 00:59:40,787
I'm not sure...

642
00:59:43,331 --> 00:59:45,291
I'm not sure here...

643
00:59:45,292 --> 00:59:46,960
...where we are...

644
00:59:47,461 --> 00:59:49,879
...is real at all.

645
00:59:52,966 --> 00:59:55,510
This feels like a game to me.

646
00:59:57,261 --> 00:59:58,846
And you...

647
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:02,100
...you're beginning to feel
like a game character.

648
01:00:08,982 --> 01:00:10,817
Definitely not.

649
01:00:29,502 --> 01:00:31,796
Let's go back.

650
01:01:01,784 --> 01:01:04,953
Special order for the birthday girl.

651
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:15,797
Hope you enjoy it very much.

652
01:01:21,512 --> 01:01:23,929
Look, it's our two-headed friend.

653
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:26,183
Doesn't look too healthy.

654
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:29,810
I think I lost my appetite.

655
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:32,105
Oh, a shame.

656
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:34,940
Mutant reptiles and amphibians...

657
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:40,571
...provide new and previously
unimagined taste sensations.

658
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:44,158
Shall I clear all this away?

659
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:52,083
We're happy.

660
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:55,752
Very good.

661
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:57,338
Enjoy.

662
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:29,577
Pikul, what are you doing?

663
01:02:29,578 --> 01:02:31,789
I don't know.

664
01:02:33,415 --> 01:02:37,128
I find this disgusting,
but I can't help myself.

665
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:40,839
Good.

666
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:44,092
"Good"? You think this is good?

667
01:02:44,426 --> 01:02:45,551
Yeah.

668
01:02:45,552 --> 01:02:47,554
It's a genuine game urge.

669
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:50,348
It's something your character
was born to do.

670
01:02:51,433 --> 01:02:52,851
Don't fight it.

671
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:55,061
I'm fighting it.

672
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:59,232
But it isn't doing me any good.

673
01:03:43,026 --> 01:03:45,319
Oh, my God.

674
01:03:47,573 --> 01:03:50,115
This looks awfully familiar.

675
01:03:55,538 --> 01:03:57,415
You sure this is okay?

676
01:03:58,208 --> 01:04:02,629
Yeah, it should be okay.

677
01:04:28,487 --> 01:04:31,198
Do you have that bridge
in real life?

678
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:35,786
Absolutely not.
My teeth are perfect.

679
01:05:05,482 --> 01:05:10,778
Death to the demoness
Allegra Geller.

680
01:05:16,827 --> 01:05:19,162
That's not funny.

681
01:05:22,415 --> 01:05:23,917
Sorry.

682
01:05:27,003 --> 01:05:28,963
But, you know...

683
01:05:30,841 --> 01:05:33,968
...I do feel the urge
to kill someone here.

684
01:05:34,386 --> 01:05:35,762
Who?

685
01:05:43,687 --> 01:05:45,605
I need to kill our waiter.

686
01:05:50,861 --> 01:05:53,363
Well, that makes sense.

687
01:05:56,491 --> 01:05:57,951
Waiter!

688
01:05:58,827 --> 01:06:00,327
Waiter!

689
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:08,378
When he comes over, do it.
Don't hesitate.

690
01:06:09,545 --> 01:06:12,298
But everything in the game...

691
01:06:12,299 --> 01:06:16,301
...is so realistic.
I don't think I really could.

692
01:06:16,302 --> 01:06:19,347
You won't be able to stop yourself.
Enjoy it.

693
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:23,309
Free will is obviously
not a big factor...

694
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:25,644
...in this little world of ours.

695
01:06:25,978 --> 01:06:30,482
It's like real life. There's
just enough to make it interesting.

696
01:06:35,988 --> 01:06:38,198
He's too nice.

697
01:06:38,199 --> 01:06:40,117
I won't do it.

698
01:06:41,744 --> 01:06:45,289
What can I do to make
your lunch more pleasant?

699
01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:49,042
I found this in my soup...

700
01:06:49,043 --> 01:06:51,962
...and I'm very upset.

701
01:07:41,511 --> 01:07:43,262
It's all right.

702
01:07:44,097 --> 01:07:48,892
Just a little misunderstanding...

703
01:07:48,893 --> 01:07:51,187
...over the check.

704
01:07:57,569 --> 01:08:00,779
Pay no attention
and enjoy your meal.

705
01:08:12,667 --> 01:08:15,626
I feel a serious game urge...

706
01:08:15,627 --> 01:08:17,672
...to get out of here.

707
01:08:24,262 --> 01:08:27,055
Through the kitchen. That way.

708
01:08:36,857 --> 01:08:40,193
Did you like the meal
I prepared for you?

709
01:08:41,945 --> 01:08:43,947
It was very...

710
01:08:44,865 --> 01:08:46,032
...revealing.

711
01:08:46,033 --> 01:08:47,909
It certainly was for me.

712
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:51,829
You both passed our little test
with flying colours.

713
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:55,792
- Why did the Chinese waiter have to die?
- A waiter hears...

714
01:08:55,793 --> 01:08:59,795
...many things spoken when
people are relaxing and eating.

715
01:08:59,796 --> 01:09:03,425
A waiter has many opportunities
for betrayal.

716
01:09:07,179 --> 01:09:08,304
He betrayed you?

717
01:09:08,305 --> 01:09:11,725
He betrayed us. Us!

718
01:09:12,017 --> 01:09:13,852
Come. This way.

719
01:09:15,978 --> 01:09:17,314
Come.

720
01:09:23,445 --> 01:09:26,905
These are the breeding pools.

721
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:28,366
Breeding pools.

722
01:09:28,367 --> 01:09:29,950
Is this...

723
01:09:29,951 --> 01:09:33,162
Is this where you caught
today's special?

724
01:09:34,123 --> 01:09:37,415
We originally were raising
these mutant creatures...

725
01:09:37,416 --> 01:09:40,794
...for their nervous systems
for game-pods.

726
01:09:40,795 --> 01:09:45,715
But then we found they
could be quite tasty.

727
01:09:45,716 --> 01:09:49,596
So we opened the restaurant,
and now that is our cover.

728
01:09:49,638 --> 01:09:52,722
We are also raising them
as components...

729
01:09:52,723 --> 01:09:56,185
...for undetectable and
hypoallergenic weapons.

730
01:09:56,436 --> 01:09:59,229
Right under the noses
of our enemies.

731
01:09:59,230 --> 01:10:02,816
And speaking of our enemies,
it's important...

732
01:10:02,817 --> 01:10:06,945
...that you go back to work
at Cortical Systematics.

733
01:10:06,946 --> 01:10:11,450
We need to maintain as many
agents there as possible.

734
01:10:11,451 --> 01:10:14,202
It's owned by Cortical Systematics?

735
01:10:14,203 --> 01:10:18,999
Yeah. Their corporate slogan should be:
" Enemies of Reality."

736
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,252
Someday soon, we will
destroy trout farm...

737
01:10:22,253 --> 01:10:25,089
...and all game-pods inside.

738
01:10:27,175 --> 01:10:29,260
We love you.

739
01:10:31,303 --> 01:10:36,766
Now that you have proven to be
true and trustworthy Realists.

740
01:10:40,937 --> 01:10:43,439
We'll be in touch.

741
01:11:02,167 --> 01:11:04,836
I'm looking for D'Arcy Nader.
Is he here?

742
01:11:17,516 --> 01:11:22,228
Hugo Carlaw, is D'Arcy Nader here?

743
01:11:23,271 --> 01:11:25,398
He's in the back.

744
01:11:28,693 --> 01:11:31,820
You want him, there he is.

745
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:44,125
You shouldn't have killed
the Chinese waiter.

746
01:11:44,334 --> 01:11:46,126
Why not?

747
01:11:46,127 --> 01:11:49,839
He was your contact
at the trout farm.

748
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,340
Damn good man.

749
01:11:54,344 --> 01:11:56,470
His dog brought me this.

750
01:11:57,346 --> 01:12:01,099
We were contacted by Yevgeny Nourish.
He knew who we were.

751
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:04,728
Nader told him that you were coming.
Nader was a mole...

752
01:12:04,729 --> 01:12:06,939
...for Cortical Systematics.

753
01:12:07,231 --> 01:12:10,109
You're with the Realist Underground.

754
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:14,738
I was placed here
to keep an eye on Nader.

755
01:12:15,197 --> 01:12:19,159
If Nourish isn't our real contact,
who is he?

756
01:12:19,326 --> 01:12:22,120
He's a double agent
for Cortical Systematics.

757
01:12:22,121 --> 01:12:25,790
He was working with Nader
to subvert the Realist cause...

758
01:12:25,791 --> 01:12:31,004
...and doing it rather well. He got
you to assassinate your own contact.

759
01:12:35,009 --> 01:12:37,719
But now you're gonna
put a stop to him.

760
01:12:40,181 --> 01:12:42,723
I don't wanna be here.

761
01:12:43,142 --> 01:12:44,809
Come on, Pikul.

762
01:12:44,810 --> 01:12:49,397
You've just got a bad case
of first-time user anxiety.

763
01:12:49,398 --> 01:12:51,273
I don't like it here.

764
01:12:51,274 --> 01:12:53,358
I don't know what's going on.

765
01:12:53,359 --> 01:12:58,155
We're both stumbling around together
in this unformed world...

766
01:12:58,156 --> 01:13:01,158
...whose rules and objectives
are largely unknown...

767
01:13:01,159 --> 01:13:04,621
...seemingly indecipherable
or possibly nonexistent...

768
01:13:04,622 --> 01:13:06,497
...always on the verge...

769
01:13:06,498 --> 01:13:10,669
...of being killed by forces
that we don't understand.

770
01:13:10,711 --> 01:13:13,378
That sounds like my game, all right.

771
01:13:13,379 --> 01:13:16,924
That sounds like a game that's
not gonna be easy to market.

772
01:13:16,925 --> 01:13:20,261
But it's a game everybody's
already playing.

773
01:13:32,690 --> 01:13:36,735
The cashier said it would be
in a familiar place.

774
01:13:37,987 --> 01:13:40,697
Is there such a thing here?

775
01:13:40,698 --> 01:13:43,200
My assembly bay.

776
01:14:13,355 --> 01:14:15,524
Is that it over there?

777
01:14:32,791 --> 01:14:37,212
God, it's ugly even for a game-pod.

778
01:14:38,464 --> 01:14:43,760
I have a terrible urge to port into it.
What about you?

779
01:14:43,761 --> 01:14:48,682
Sure. Yeah.
Desperate to port into it.

780
01:14:57,815 --> 01:14:59,442
All right. Here we go.

781
01:14:59,443 --> 01:15:02,653
- You wanna give me a hand?
- You're not serious!

782
01:15:03,237 --> 01:15:06,407
That's a diseased pod.
You port into that--

783
01:15:06,408 --> 01:15:08,534
Yes, exactly.

784
01:15:09,244 --> 01:15:11,621
Help me.

785
01:15:21,507 --> 01:15:25,217
How long does it take
for the infection to take hold?

786
01:15:28,096 --> 01:15:29,930
No time at all.

787
01:15:31,225 --> 01:15:34,226
Then you quietly port
into the other pods...

788
01:15:34,352 --> 01:15:37,272
...and spread the infection to them.

789
01:15:39,357 --> 01:15:41,233
Oh, God.

790
01:15:42,276 --> 01:15:44,153
What's happening?

791
01:15:44,987 --> 01:15:46,530
Something's wrong.

792
01:15:47,782 --> 01:15:50,200
I'm gonna unport you now.

793
01:15:51,661 --> 01:15:53,579
Oh, God! Don't!

794
01:15:54,163 --> 01:15:56,206
That really hurts.

795
01:15:56,207 --> 01:15:58,542
I'm gonna cut you free.

796
01:16:03,881 --> 01:16:06,050
No! I'm afraid!

797
01:16:31,033 --> 01:16:32,951
Pikul...

798
01:16:33,577 --> 01:16:36,079
...I'm bleeding to death.
