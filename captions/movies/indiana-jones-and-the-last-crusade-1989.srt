00:17:57,928 --> 00:18:01,098
INDY: Well, it's sandstone.
Christian symbol.

168
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,517
Early Latin text.

169
00:18:03,976 --> 00:18:05,853
Mid-12th century, I should think.

170
00:18:05,936 --> 00:18:07,771
That was our assessment, as well.

171
00:18:07,855 --> 00:18:08,939
Where did this come from?

172
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,984
My engineers unearthed it
in the mountain region north of Ankara

173
00:18:12,067 --> 00:18:14,278
while excavating for copper.

174
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:16,864
Can you translate the inscription?

175
00:18:18,115 --> 00:18:19,825
(READING LATIN)

176
00:18:19,908 --> 00:18:23,662
"...who drinks the water
I shall give him, says the Lord,

177
00:18:23,746 --> 00:18:26,707
"will have a spring inside him

178
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:29,668
"welling up for eternal life.

179
00:18:31,587 --> 00:18:33,422
"Let them bring me
to your holy mountain

180
00:18:33,505 --> 00:18:35,633
"in the place where you dwell.

181
00:18:35,716 --> 00:18:38,636
"Across the desert
and through the mountain

182
00:18:39,595 --> 00:18:42,139
"to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon,

183
00:18:43,057 --> 00:18:45,684
"to the temple where the cup that...

184
00:18:48,937 --> 00:18:53,192
"Where the cup that holds the blood
of Jesus Christ resides forever."

185
00:18:54,985 --> 00:18:57,363
The Holy Grail, Dr. Jones.

186
00:18:58,697 --> 00:19:01,909
The chalice used by Christ
during the Last Supper.

187
00:19:02,826 --> 00:19:05,746
The cup that caught His blood
at the Crucifixion

188
00:19:05,829 --> 00:19:08,749
and was entrusted to
Joseph of Arimathea.

189
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,585
The Arthur legend.

190
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:14,088
I've heard this bedtime story before.

191
00:19:14,171 --> 00:19:15,964
Eternal life, Dr. Jones!

192
00:19:16,048 --> 00:19:18,801
The gift of youth
to whoever drinks from the Grail.

193
00:19:18,884 --> 00:19:21,261
Now, that's a bedtime story
I'd like to wake up to.

194
00:19:21,345 --> 00:19:22,596
An old man's dream.

195
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,141
Every man's dream,
including your father's, I believe.

196
00:19:30,229 --> 00:19:32,272
Grail lore is his hobby.

197
00:19:32,356 --> 00:19:33,941
He's a teacher of medieval literature.

198
00:19:34,024 --> 00:19:35,859
The one the students hope
they don't get.

199
00:19:37,027 --> 00:19:39,321
Walter, you're neglecting your guests.

200
00:19:39,405 --> 00:19:41,532
DONOVAN: Be along in a moment, dear.

201
00:19:46,995 --> 00:19:48,831
Hard to resist, isn't it?

202
00:19:48,914 --> 00:19:52,501
The Holy Grail's final resting place
described in detail.

203
00:19:52,751 --> 00:19:54,420
What good is it?

204
00:19:54,503 --> 00:19:58,298
This Grail tablet speaks of deserts
and mountains and canyons.

205
00:19:58,549 --> 00:19:59,800
It's pretty vague.

206
00:19:59,883 --> 00:20:01,510
Where do you want to start looking?

207
00:20:01,593 --> 00:20:03,929
Maybe if the tablet were intact,
you'd have something to go on,

208
00:20:04,012 --> 00:20:05,639
but the entire top portion is missing.

209
00:20:05,723 --> 00:20:09,059
Just the same, an attempt to recover
the Grail is currently underway.

210
00:20:11,854 --> 00:20:15,023
Let me tell you another
bedtime story, Dr. Jones.

211
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:18,152
After the Grail was entrusted
to Joseph of Arimathea,

212
00:20:18,235 --> 00:20:21,113
it disappeared,
and was lost for a thousand years

213
00:20:21,196 --> 00:20:24,950
before it was found again
by three knights of the First Crusade.

214
00:20:25,033 --> 00:20:26,493
Three brothers, to be exact.

215
00:20:26,577 --> 00:20:28,579
I've heard this one, as well.

216
00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:30,706
Two of these brothers
walked out of the desert

217
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:33,834
150 years after having found the Grail

218
00:20:33,917 --> 00:20:35,961
and began the long journey
back to France,

219
00:20:36,044 --> 00:20:38,088
but only one of them made it.

220
00:20:38,172 --> 00:20:41,550
And before dying of extreme old age,

221
00:20:41,633 --> 00:20:46,263
he supposedly imparted his tale to a...
to a Franciscan friar, I think.

222
00:20:46,805 --> 00:20:49,099
Not "supposedly," Dr. Jones.

223
00:20:49,808 --> 00:20:54,229
This is the manuscript in which
the friar chronicled the knight's story.

224
00:20:54,855 --> 00:20:57,274
It doesn't reveal the location of
the Grail, I'm afraid,

225
00:20:57,441 --> 00:20:59,151
but the knight promised
that two markers

226
00:20:59,234 --> 00:21:00,778
that had been left behind would.

227
00:21:01,153 --> 00:21:04,490
This tablet is one of those markers.

228
00:21:04,573 --> 00:21:06,784
It proves the knight's story is true.

229
00:21:06,867 --> 00:21:09,453
But as you pointed out, it's incomplete.

230
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:12,498
Now, the second marker is entombed
with the knight's dead brother.

231
00:21:13,081 --> 00:21:15,667
Our project leader
believes that tomb to be located

232
00:21:15,751 --> 00:21:18,420
within the city of Venice, Italy.

233
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:22,883
As you can now see, Dr. Jones,

234
00:21:23,425 --> 00:21:25,969
we're about to complete a great quest

235
00:21:26,053 --> 00:21:29,097
that began almost 2,000 years ago.

236
00:21:29,807 --> 00:21:31,558
We're only one step away.

237
00:21:31,642 --> 00:21:34,812
That's usually when the ground falls out
from underneath your feet.

238
00:21:35,646 --> 00:21:37,523
You could be more right than you know.

239
00:21:37,815 --> 00:21:38,899
Yes?

240
00:21:39,149 --> 00:21:40,818
We've hit a snag.

241
00:21:41,777 --> 00:21:45,864
Our project leader has vanished,
along with all his research.

242
00:21:46,782 --> 00:21:49,451
We received a cable from his colleague,
Dr. Schneider,

243
00:21:49,535 --> 00:21:53,247
who has no idea of his whereabouts
or what's become of him.

244
00:21:53,664 --> 00:21:57,000
I want you to pick up the trail
where he left off.

245
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:00,170
Find the man,
and you will find the Grail.

246
00:22:01,713 --> 00:22:04,508
You've got the wrong Jones,
Mr. Donovan.

247
00:22:06,343 --> 00:22:08,303
Why don't you try my father?

248
00:22:08,387 --> 00:22:10,180
We already have.

249
00:22:10,264 --> 00:22:13,225
Your father is the man
who has disappeared.

250
00:22:24,862 --> 00:22:27,114
BRODY: Your father and I have been
friends since time began.

251
00:22:27,197 --> 00:22:28,407
I've watched you grow up, Indy.

252
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,200
I've watched the two of you grow apart.

253
00:22:30,284 --> 00:22:32,286
I've never seen you this concerned
about him before.

254
00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:33,495
Dad?

255
00:22:33,579 --> 00:22:35,706
He's an academic, a bookworm.
He's not a field man.

256
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:36,874
Dad?

257
00:22:37,499 --> 00:22:38,542
Dad?

258
00:22:39,042 --> 00:22:40,294
Dear God.

259
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,425
BRODY: What has the old fool
got himself into now?

260
00:22:47,509 --> 00:22:50,512
I don't know, but whatever it is,
he's in over his head.

261
00:22:51,221 --> 00:22:52,264
Dad?

262
00:22:52,848 --> 00:22:55,601
It's today's mail, and it's been opened.

263
00:22:58,186 --> 00:22:59,271
Mail.

264
00:22:59,897 --> 00:23:01,565
That's it, Marcus.

265
00:23:04,026 --> 00:23:05,527
Venice, Italy.

266
00:23:08,864 --> 00:23:10,240
BRODY: What is it?

267
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:15,412
INDY: It's Dad's Grail diary.

268
00:23:17,331 --> 00:23:20,417
Every clue he followed.
Every discovery he made.

269
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,003
A complete record of his search
for the Holy Grail.

270
00:23:24,755 --> 00:23:26,673
This is his whole life.

271
00:23:27,215 --> 00:23:29,760
Why would he have sent this to me?

272
00:23:29,843 --> 00:23:31,261
I don't know,

273
00:23:31,345 --> 00:23:33,972
but someone must want it pretty badly.

274
00:23:44,107 --> 00:23:46,026
Do you believe, Marcus?

275
00:23:58,121 --> 00:24:00,916
Do you believe the Grail actually exists?

276
00:24:02,292 --> 00:24:06,880
The search for the Cup of Christ
is the search for the divine in all of us.

277
00:24:07,255 --> 00:24:09,967
But if you want facts, Indy,
I've none to give you.

278
00:24:11,134 --> 00:24:14,554
At my age, I'm prepared to
take a few things on faith.

279
00:24:20,477 --> 00:24:21,645
Call Donovan, Marcus.

280
00:24:21,728 --> 00:24:24,648
Tell him I'll take that ticket
to Venice now.

281
00:24:26,316 --> 00:24:28,318
I'll tell him we'll take two.

282
00:24:33,407 --> 00:24:36,076
All right, tell me what's going to happen
when we get to Venice.

283
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,120
Don't worry, Dr. Schneider
will be there to meet you.

284
00:24:38,203 --> 00:24:39,621
- Schneider?
- I maintain an apartment in Venice.

285
00:24:39,705 --> 00:24:40,747
It's at your disposal.

286
00:24:40,831 --> 00:24:42,749
Oh, well, that's good. Thank you.

287
00:24:44,876 --> 00:24:47,170
Dr. Jones, good luck.

288
00:24:48,005 --> 00:24:51,008
Now be very careful.
Don't trust anybody.

289
00:25:25,167 --> 00:25:27,127
<i>Signora? Signorina?</i>

290
00:25:34,718 --> 00:25:37,554
- Ah, Venice...
- Yes.

291
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,725
How will we recognize
this Dr. Schneider when we see him?

292
00:25:42,225 --> 00:25:44,853
I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.

293
00:25:44,936 --> 00:25:46,271
WOMAN: Dr. Jones?

294
00:25:47,939 --> 00:25:49,066
INDY: Yes?

295
00:25:49,733 --> 00:25:51,401
I knew it was you.

296
00:25:52,069 --> 00:25:54,237
You have your father's eyes.

297
00:25:56,281 --> 00:25:59,534
And my mother's ears,
but the rest belongs to you.

298
00:26:00,243 --> 00:26:02,788
Looks like the best parts
have already been spoken for.

299
00:26:03,663 --> 00:26:05,791
- Marcus Brody?
- That's right.

300
00:26:06,416 --> 00:26:07,626
Dr. Elsa Schneider.

301
00:26:07,709 --> 00:26:08,877
How do you do?

302
00:26:09,795 --> 00:26:12,756
ELSA: The last time I saw your father,
we were in the library.

303
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:15,342
He was very close to tracking down
the knight's tomb.

304
00:26:15,425 --> 00:26:17,302
(LAUGHS) I've never seen him
so excited.

305
00:26:17,385 --> 00:26:19,721
He was as giddy as a schoolboy.

306
00:26:19,805 --> 00:26:21,807
INDY: Who? Attila the Professor?

307
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:25,060
He was never giddy,
even when he was a schoolboy.

308
00:26:25,811 --> 00:26:27,771
<i>Fräulein,</i> will you permit me?

309
00:26:27,979 --> 00:26:29,856
- I usually don't.
- I usually don't, either.

310
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,359
- In that case, I permit you.
- It would make me very happy.

311
00:26:32,442 --> 00:26:34,778
But I'm already sad.
By tomorrow, it will have faded.

312
00:26:34,861 --> 00:26:35,862
Tomorrow I'll steal you another.

313
00:26:35,946 --> 00:26:38,281
I hate to interrupt you,
but the reason we're here...

314
00:26:38,365 --> 00:26:40,325
Yes. I have something to show you.

315
00:26:40,408 --> 00:26:42,202
I left your father working in the library.

316
00:26:42,285 --> 00:26:45,372
He sent me to the map section
to fetch an ancient plan of the city.

317
00:26:45,455 --> 00:26:48,291
When I got back to his table,
he'd gone, with all his papers,

318
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:50,877
except for that scrap,
which I found near his chair.

319
00:26:50,961 --> 00:26:51,962
Roman numerals.

320
00:26:52,587 --> 00:26:54,339
ELSA: Here is the library.

321
00:26:54,714 --> 00:26:57,342
INDY: That doesn't look
much like a library.

322
00:26:57,592 --> 00:26:59,553
BRODY: Looks like a converted church.

323
00:26:59,636 --> 00:27:01,721
In this case, it's the literal truth.

324
00:27:01,805 --> 00:27:03,557
We are on holy ground.

325
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:07,269
These columns over here
were brought back as spoils of war

326
00:27:07,352 --> 00:27:10,647
after the sacking of Byzantium
during the Crusades.

327
00:27:12,065 --> 00:27:13,608
Now, please excuse me.

328
00:27:13,692 --> 00:27:15,402
The library's closing in a few moments.

329
00:27:15,485 --> 00:27:18,446
I'll arrange for us to stay a little longer.

330
00:27:21,074 --> 00:27:24,661
Marcus, I've seen this window before.

331
00:27:24,744 --> 00:27:25,745
Where?

332
00:27:25,829 --> 00:27:27,998
Right here, in Dad's diary.

333
00:27:36,548 --> 00:27:37,757
INDY: You see?

334
00:27:37,841 --> 00:27:40,635
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals.

335
00:27:41,386 --> 00:27:43,388
Dad was onto something here.

336
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,307
Well, now we know
the source of the numbers,

337
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,350
but we still don't know what they mean.

338
00:27:47,434 --> 00:27:48,935
Dad sent me this diary for a reason.

339
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:51,730
Until we find out why,
I suggest we keep it to ourselves.

340
00:27:51,813 --> 00:27:53,023
Find something?

341
00:27:53,106 --> 00:27:55,108
Yes. Three, seven and ten.

342
00:27:55,192 --> 00:27:57,694
That window seems to be
the source of the Roman numerals.

343
00:27:57,777 --> 00:27:59,362
My God, I must be blind.

344
00:27:59,446 --> 00:28:02,616
Dad wasn't looking for a book
about the knight's tomb,

345
00:28:02,699 --> 00:28:04,659
he was looking for the tomb itself.

346
00:28:04,743 --> 00:28:06,077
Don't you get it?

347
00:28:06,161 --> 00:28:08,121
The tomb is somewhere in the library.

348
00:28:08,205 --> 00:28:10,123
You said yourself it used to be a church.

349
00:28:10,207 --> 00:28:11,333
Look.

350
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:12,792
Three.

351
00:28:15,128 --> 00:28:16,296
Three.

352
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,839
Seven.

353
00:28:17,923 --> 00:28:19,466
Seven. Ten.

354
00:28:21,176 --> 00:28:22,385
And ten.

355
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,262
Now where's the ten?

356
00:28:25,931 --> 00:28:27,891
Look around for the ten.

357
00:28:37,067 --> 00:28:38,693
INDY: Three and seven.

358
00:28:38,944 --> 00:28:40,862
Seven and seven

359
00:28:41,738 --> 00:28:42,906
and ten.

360
00:29:03,593 --> 00:29:04,594
Ten.

361
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:08,431
"X" marks the spot.

You don't disappoint, Dr. Jones.

365

You're a great deal like your father.

366
00:30:10,535 --> 00:30:12,078
Except he's lost, and I'm not.

367
00:30:12,162 --> 00:30:13,663
Lower me down.

368
00:30:23,715 --> 00:30:26,134
Look after this for me, will you?

369

Come on.

370
00:30:48,907 --> 00:30:51,701
Pagan symbols. Fourth or fifth century.

371
00:30:51,868 --> 00:30:52,869
Right.

372
00:30:53,036 --> 00:30:55,413
600 years before the Crusades.

373
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:57,999
The Christians would have
dug their own passages

374
00:30:58,083 --> 00:31:00,293
and burial chambers centuries later.

375
00:31:00,377 --> 00:31:01,336
INDY: That's right.

376
00:31:01,419 --> 00:31:03,963
If there's a knight of
the First Crusade down here,

377
00:31:04,047 --> 00:31:05,548
that's where we'll find him.

- Pretty sure.

Watch out.

383
00:32:17,662 --> 00:32:18,872
It's petroleum.

384
00:32:18,955 --> 00:32:21,791
I should sink a well down here
and retire.

385
00:32:38,975 --> 00:32:40,143
Give me the lighter.

This is it. We found it.

Look.

396
00:34:56,946 --> 00:35:01,117
The engraving on the shield,
it's the same as on the Grail tablet.

397
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,455
The shield is the second marker.

398

What's that?

399
00:35:07,373 --> 00:35:10,376

of the Grail tablet.

Just like your father,
giddy as a schoolboy.

Wouldn't it be wonderful
if he were here now to see this?

00:35:21,137 --> 00:35:23,306
He never would have
made it past the rats.

He hates rats.

Because you're looking
for the Holy Grail.

seek the Cup of Christ?

Is it for His glory, or for yours?

I didn't come for the Cup of Christ.
I came to find my father.

It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta"?

The knights of the First Crusade

455

laid siege to the city
of Alexandretta for over a year.

The entire city was destroyed.

Marcus, you remember
what the Grail tablet said,

459
00:41:41,767 --> 00:41:43,436
"Across the desert
and through the mountain

"to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."

But where exactly?

462
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,737
Your father would know.

463
00:41:54,697 --> 00:41:57,658
Your father did know.
Look. He made a map.

464
00:41:58,367 --> 00:42:00,327
He must have pieced it together
from clues scattered through

465

the whole history of the Grail quest.

466

A map with no names.

467
00:42:03,748 --> 00:42:07,543
Now, he knew there was a city
with an oasis due east, here.

468
00:42:07,626 --> 00:42:10,463
He knew the course turned south
through the desert to a river,

469
00:42:10,546 --> 00:42:12,381
and the river led
into the mountains, here.

00:42:12,465 --> 00:42:13,758
Straight to the canyon.

471
00:42:13,883 --> 00:42:16,343
He knew everything
except where to begin,

472
00:42:16,427 --> 00:42:18,220
the name of the city.

473

Alexandretta.

- Yes. Now we know.

more than he was looking for.

00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:08,221
Where are these missing pages,
this map?

653
00:54:08,305 --> 00:54:09,681
We must have these pages back.

654
00:54:09,765 --> 00:54:11,016
You're wasting your breath.

655
00:54:11,099 --> 00:54:12,893
He won't tell us,

656
00:54:12,976 --> 00:54:14,811
and he doesn't have to.

657
00:54:15,479 --> 00:54:18,440
It's perfectly obvious
where the pages are.

658
00:54:19,191 --> 00:54:20,942
He's given them to Marcus Brody.

659
00:54:21,026 --> 00:54:22,068
HENRY: Marcus?

660
00:54:22,444 --> 00:54:24,529
You didn't drag poor Marcus along,
did you?

661
00:54:24,613 --> 00:54:26,031
He's not up to the challenge.

662
00:54:26,114 --> 00:54:27,574
He sticks out like a sore thumb.

663
00:54:27,657 --> 00:54:28,784
We'll find him.

664
00:54:28,867 --> 00:54:30,535
The hell you will.

665
00:54:30,619 --> 00:54:32,287
He's got a two-day head start on you,

666
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:33,789
which is more than he needs.

667
00:54:34,289 --> 00:54:36,208
Brody's got friends
in every town and village

668
00:54:36,291 --> 00:54:37,375
from here to the Sudan.

669
00:54:37,459 --> 00:54:40,128
He speaks a dozen languages,
knows every local custom.

670
00:54:40,212 --> 00:54:42,047
He'll blend in, disappear.

671
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:43,965
You'll never see him again.

672
00:54:44,049 --> 00:54:46,635
With any luck,
he's got the Grail already.

673
00:54:47,803 --> 00:54:49,888
Does anyone here speak English?

674
00:54:49,971 --> 00:54:51,056
Or even ancient Greek?

675
00:54:51,139 --> 00:54:52,307
Water? No, thank you, sir.

676
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:53,725
No. Fish make love in it.

677
00:54:54,726 --> 00:54:57,062
Goodness me. Thank you so much.
No, I don't like that.

678
00:54:57,145 --> 00:54:58,313
No, I really don't want...

679
00:54:58,396 --> 00:55:00,565
No, no, thank you very much.

680
00:55:00,649 --> 00:55:02,651
No, thank you, madam. I'm a vegetarian.

681
00:55:03,151 --> 00:55:05,862
Does anyone understand
a word I'm saying here?

682
00:55:05,946 --> 00:55:07,405
Mr. Brody!

683
00:55:07,489 --> 00:55:08,657
Sallah. What a relief.

684
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:11,076
Marcus Brody, sir.

685
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:12,869
- But where is Indy?
- He's in Austria.

686
00:55:12,953 --> 00:55:14,412
A slight detour.

687
00:55:14,496 --> 00:55:15,539
You are on your own?

688
00:55:15,622 --> 00:55:18,333
Yes, but don't panic.
Everything's under control.

689
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:20,669
Have you, have you
arranged our supplies?

690
00:55:20,752 --> 00:55:22,587
Yes, of course.
But where are we going?

691
00:55:22,671 --> 00:55:24,130
This map will show you.

692
00:55:24,214 --> 00:55:26,174
It was drawn by...

693
00:55:26,675 --> 00:55:28,093
Mr. Brody.

694
00:55:28,677 --> 00:55:30,011
Welcome to Iskenderun.

695
00:55:30,178 --> 00:55:32,097
The director
of the Museum of Antiquities

696
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:33,306
has sent a car for you.

697
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:35,684
Well, your servant, sir.

698
00:55:35,934 --> 00:55:37,018
And I am his.

699
00:55:37,853 --> 00:55:39,062
Follow me, please.

700
00:55:39,521 --> 00:55:41,106
My reputation precedes me.

701
00:55:41,189 --> 00:55:43,358
There is no museum in Iskenderun.

702
00:55:43,441 --> 00:55:44,818
Papers, please.

703
00:55:44,901 --> 00:55:47,279
Papers? Of course.

704
00:55:47,362 --> 00:55:48,822
- Run.
- Yes.

705
00:55:48,905 --> 00:55:50,657
Papers. Got it here.

706
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:52,367
Just finished reading it myself.

707
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:54,619
- Run.
- Yes.

708
00:55:54,703 --> 00:55:56,621
<i>Egyptian Mail,</i> morning edition. Run.

709
00:55:56,705 --> 00:55:57,914

710
00:55:58,039 --> 00:55:59,457
Run!

711
00:56:14,306 --> 00:56:16,141
Okay, okay, quick, quick, quick!

714
00:56:36,912 --> 00:56:38,663
Dr. Schneider. Message from Berlin.

715
00:56:38,747 --> 00:56:40,540
You must return immediately.

716
00:56:40,624 --> 00:56:43,460
- A rally at the Institute of Aryan Culture.
- So?

717
00:56:43,543 --> 00:56:47,714
Your presence on the platform
is requested at the highest level.

718
00:56:47,797 --> 00:56:50,800
Thank you, <i>Herr</i> Oberst.
I will meet you at Iskenderun.

719
00:56:50,884 --> 00:56:52,802
Take this diary
to the Reichmuseum in Berlin.

720
00:56:52,886 --> 00:56:55,430
It will show them our progress,
ahead of schedule.

721
00:56:55,513 --> 00:56:57,933
Without the map,
I'm afraid it's no better than a souvenir.

722
00:56:58,016 --> 00:56:59,267
Let me kill them now.

723
00:56:59,351 --> 00:57:00,435
No.

724
00:57:00,518 --> 00:57:02,354
If we fail to recover
the pages from Brody,

725
00:57:02,437 --> 00:57:04,022
we'll need them alive.

726
00:57:04,105 --> 00:57:06,608
Always do what the doctor orders.

727
00:57:14,532 --> 00:57:15,951
Don't look at me like that.

728
00:57:16,826 --> 00:57:18,620
We both wanted the Grail.

729
00:57:18,703 --> 00:57:20,622
I would have done anything to get it.

730
00:57:20,705 --> 00:57:22,707
You would have done the same.

731
00:57:22,791 --> 00:57:24,709
I'm sorry you think so.

732
00:57:35,971 --> 00:57:39,516
I can't forget how wonderful it was.

733
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:40,642
Thank you.

734
00:57:40,725 --> 00:57:42,644
It was rather wonderful.

Let's try and get these ropes loose.

743

We've got to get to Marcus
before the Nazis do.

You said he had two days' start.
That he would blend in. Disappear.

Are you kidding? I made that up.

746

You know Marcus.
He got lost once in his own museum.

01:05:59,474 --> 01:06:04,020
Well, he who finds the Grail
must face the final challenge.

819
01:06:04,103 --> 01:06:05,897
What final challenge?

820
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:08,774
Three devices of such lethal cunning.

821
01:06:08,858 --> 01:06:10,485
- Booby traps?
- Oh, yes.

But I found the clues that
will safely take us through,

so that I wouldn't have to remember.

and you want me to go to Berlin?

A knight? What do you mean?

I was chosen

1223
01:50:22,188 --> 01:50:25,733
because I was the bravest,
the most worthy.

1224

The honor was mine until another came

to challenge me to single combat.
