162

Now I remember why I took that desk job.

163

- Dr. Drumlin, how are you?
- Dr. Drumlin.

164
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,889
Glad you could make it, David.

165
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:13,601
If I'd known it was gonna take
three planes, I might've reconsidered.

166
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,144
How is that new office?

167
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:19,899
I'm still settling in. They already wanna take
half my budget and give it to the Pentagon.

168
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,944
Ellie. Still waiting for E.T. To call?

169
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:27,115
- Well, I understand we're having a little...
- Good to see you too.

170
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,283
Asshole.

171
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,785
Uh-oh. Looks like
it's gonna be a long night.

172
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:35,415
Science must first be accountable to the
people who are paying for it, the taxpayers.

173
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,960
We need to stop wasting money
on pie-in-the-sky abstractions...

174
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:42,088
...and start spending it on practical,
measurable ways...

175
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:45,133
...to improve the lives of the people
who are footing the bill.

176
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,428
Not unlike my L-band,
globular-clusters work.

177
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,639
Wait, you're saying you wanna do away
with all pure research now?

178
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:55,143
What's wrong with science being practical?
Even profitable?

179
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:59,188
Nothing, as long as your motive
is the search for truth.

180
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:02,483
Which is exactly what
the pursuit of science is.

181
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,862
That's a rather interesting position...

182

...coming from a man on a crusade
against the evils of technology...

183
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:10,950
...Father Joss.

184
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,995
PALMER:
I'm not against technology, doctor.

185
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:18,416
I'm against the men who deify it
at the expense of human truth.

186
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:25,465
Kent, I've been meaning to have
a word with you. Over here, please.

187
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,508
KENT:
Yeah, I'll just...

188
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:34,641
I think that hurt my chances
with that interview. What do you think?

189
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,101
You're a priest?

190
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,854
No, not really.

191
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:43,608
I got my Masters in Divinity...

192
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:47,362
...then dropped out of seminary to
do some secular humanitarian work...

193
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,031
...coordinating efforts
for Third World churches.

194
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,284
I couldn't live with
the whole celibacy thing.

195
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,038
You could...

196
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,791
You could call me a man of the cloth...

197
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,210
...without the cloth.

198
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,215
You wanna get out of here?

199
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:12,637
All right, you see that sort of large,
W-shaped constellation right there?

200
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,263
That's Cassiopeia.

201
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:18,977
And Cassiopeia A gives off
a whole lot of radio signals.

202
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:23,648
I actually listen to them a lot.
It's a remnant of a supernova.

203
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:27,235
When did you know
you wanted to be an astronomer?

204
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,195
Well, when l...

205
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:33,199
When I was about 8 years old,
I was watching the sunset...

206
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:36,744
...and I asked my dad,
"What's that bright star over there?"

207
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,580
Dad, what's that star there?

208
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:43,251
And he said that it wasrt
really a star at all. It was actually...

209
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,086
That's not a star, it's a planet.

210
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,879
- A whole planet called Venus...

211
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,048
That's the planet Venus.

212
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:55,346
- Which should be over there soon.

213
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,224
He said,
"You know why they called it Venus?

214
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,686
Because they thought
it was so beautiful and glowing.

215
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,938
But what they didn't know...

216
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,733
...is that it's filled with...

217
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:11,654
...deadly gases and sulfuric acid rain."

218
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:16,909
"Wow," I thought,
"This is it! I'm hooked."

219
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:22,457
You know, there are four hundred billion
stars out there...

220
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,876
...just in our galaxy alone.

221
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:29,130
If only one out of a million
of those had planets...

222
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,467
...all right, and ifjust one
out of a million of those had life...

223
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:37,263
...and ifjust one out of a million
of those had intelligent life...

224
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:42,560
...there would be literally millions
of civilizations out there.

225
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:46,064
Well, if there wasrt...

226
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,983
...it'd be an awful waste of space.

227
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,324
Amen.

228
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:09,670
PALMER: So I was lying there,
just looking at the sky.

229
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:16,427
And then I felt something. I don't know, l...

230
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,806
All I know is that I wasrt alone.

231
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:24,894
And for the first time in my life
I wasrt scared of nothing, you know?

232
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,021
Not even dying.

233
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,403
It was God.

234
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:39,200
And there's no chance that...

235
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:43,621
...you had this experience because
some part of you needed to have it?

236
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:48,376
I mean, I'm a reasonably intelligent guy,
but this...

237
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:55,216
No, this... No, my intellect,
it couldn't even touch this.

238
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,425
No.

239
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,472
I've been to Sunday school a few times.

240
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,642
Uh-huh. And?

241
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:10,064
Well, I just kept asking all these
really annoying questions like:

242
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,192
"All right, then where did Mrs. Cain
come from?"

243
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,071
And pretty soon they called my dad
and they asked him...

244
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,991
...if he wouldn't mind just
keeping me home from now on.

- Yeah.

You're close to him, aren't you?

248
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:35,047
Yeah, I was.
He died when I was 9 years old.

249
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,926

00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:45,394
...the most important discovery
of the human race nonsense, okay?

315
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:46,979
There's 400 billion stars...

316
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:50,024
And two probabilities.
One, there is intelligent life...

317
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:53,235
...but it's so far away you'll
never contact it in your lifetime.

318
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,613
- And two!
- You're making a decision...

319
00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:00,200
There's nothing but noble gases and carbon
compounds and you're wasting your time.

320
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:03,454
In the meantime, you won't be published,
won't be taken seriously.

321
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,331
And your career will be over.

322
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:08,876
So what? It's my life.

323
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,791
Hey, Kent. You were right.

324
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:52,670
Screw Drumlin. We're gonna raise
the money. We're going to New Mexico.

325
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:55,381
KENT: Chicago has all the stuff,
but let me know how it goes.

326
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:58,425
I've got some more corporate stops
on the East Coast for you.

327
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:01,762
Hey, Fish, did that investor from Houston
ever get back to us?

328
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,931
FISHER:
I'm gonna hit him up on my way to L.A.

329
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,266
ELLIE: Try begging for some of that
Hollywood money.

330
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:10,062
Why not? They've been making money
off of aliens for years, right?

331
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,065
- Begging is good for the soul.
- We'll see about that.

332
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,900
- Just do me a favor.
- Yeah.

333
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,861
Try not to be too confrontational.

334
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,489
Huh? Confrontational? Me?
What do you mean?

335
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,282
I'm gonna see if I left anything.

336
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:59,486
ELLIE: This is a unique time in our history,
in the history of any civilization.

337
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:02,448
It's the moment
of the acquisition of technology.

338
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:05,492
That's the moment
where contact becomes possible.

339
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:11,039
The Very Large Array in New Mexico
is the key to our chances for success.

340
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:13,459
With its 27 linked radio telescopes...

341
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:17,004
...we can search more accurately
than at any other conventional facility.

342
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:22,342
Now, we've gotten approval to buy
the telescope time from the government.

343
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,012
Now all we really need is the money.

344
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,806
A nice presentation, doctor.

345
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:33,020
But while our foundation arm has a mandate
to support experimental programs...

346
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:37,149
...we must confess that
your proposal seems less like science...

347
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,026
...and more like science fiction.

348
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:42,988
Science fiction.

349
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,202
You're right.

350
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,245
It's crazy.

351
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,999
In fact, it's even worse than that: Nuts.

352
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:57,044
You wanna hear something nutty?

353
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,880
A couple guys wanted to build
something called an airplane.

354
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:03,217
You get people to go in it and fly like birds.
Ridiculous, right?

355
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,344
Or what about
breaking the sound barrier...

356
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:09,139
...or rockets to the moon,
or atomic energy or a mission to Mars?

357
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,183
Science fiction, right?

358
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,476
Look.

359
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:16,897
All I'm asking is for you to
just have the tiniest bit of vision.

360
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:20,651
You know, to just step back for one minute
and look at the big picture.

361
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,277
To take a chance on something...

362
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:26,073
...which might end up being
the most profoundly impactful moment...

363
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:30,410
...for humanity, for the history of history.

364
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,165
I'm sorry.

365
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,918
I just spent the last 13 months...

366
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:41,922
...coming into rooms like this
and talking to people like you.

367
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,050
The truth is, you're my last chance, so...

368
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,677
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

369
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,136

370
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:58,772
Yes, sir.

00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,068

Frank, look at the size
of that son of a bitch!

Welcome back, Dr. C.

377
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,521
How'd it go?

378
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,442
- How was the trip?
- I've had better.

379
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:29,029
Drumlin. What is this?
This his personal vendetta now?

380
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:33,116
It's not just Drumlin. There's been enormous
pressure from other scientists as well.

381
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:36,536
It doesn't matter anyway,
Hadders funding us for another two years.

Uh... These are government-owned
telescopes, they can lease to whomever.

383
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:43,835
And they don't want the high priestess
of the desert using them anymore.

- Doesrt matter, we're a joke to them.

388
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:57,391
They want us out.

We've got three months

Fine. I'll start looking for other funding.
I'll just start...

Just this once, Ellie. We lost.

Fine.

394
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,751
But I'm not stopping.

395
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,921
If I have to go it alone, I'll go it alone.
I've done it before.

401
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,824
Thanks for being with us, Palmer.

402
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:40,786
You have had quite a ride
this last couple of years.

403
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:43,413
Yeah, I sure have, Larry.

404
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,083
You know, Fish, I was thinking.

405
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:50,587
Who would make the best astronomers?
I mean, think about it.

406
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:56,760
Who has the perfect synthesis
of career and lifestyle?

00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,846
- I give.
- Vampires!

Are you anti-technology?
Are you anti-science?

409
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,601
PALMER:
No, not at all.

410
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,646
The question that I'm asking is this:

411
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:11,024
Are we happier as a human race?

412
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:16,113
Is the world fundamentally a better place
because of science and technology?

413
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:19,282
We shop at home, we surf the Web...

414
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:22,285
...but at the same time we feel emptier...

415
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:27,290
...and more cut off from each other
than at any other time in human history.

416
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,127
I mean, we're becoming
a synthesized society...

417
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:33,630
...in a great, big hurry
to get to the next...

418
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:50,522
I think it's because we're looking
for the meaning. What is the meaning?

419
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,400
We have mindless jobs,
we take frantic vacations.

to buy more things...

00:35:57,029 --> 00:36:00,699
...that we think are gonna fill
these holes in our lives.

422
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:03,410
Is it any wonder that we've lost

Make me a liar, Fish.

475
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:04,484
It could be AWACS out of Kirtland
jamming us.

00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,027
But I'm doubting it.

All right, let's see
if F.U.D.D.'s reading it too.

Willie, patch it back
and give me the off-axis.

Thank you, Elmer.

Somewhere in Lyra, I think.

00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,361
- Vega?
FISHER: Can't be.

It's only 26 light years away.

FISHER: Coming up.

Vega.

00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:59,456
Vega. I scanned it a bunch of times at
Arecibo. It was negative results, always.

That was a three,

Those are primes.

Two, three, five, seven,
those are all prime numbers.

There's no way
that's a natural phenomenon.

- Okay, okay.

Let's just calm down
and pull up the star file on Vega.

512
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:23,623
FISHER: It doesn't make any sense.
The system is too young...

513
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,792
...so it can't have a planetary system...

514
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,379
...let alone life
or a technological civilization.

515
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,131
Maybe they didn't grow up there.
Maybe they're visiting.

Spacecraft? This system is
full of debris. It would get clobbered.

Well, not if they used their laser blasters
and photon torpedoes.

00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:43,560
- That's not funny.
- How else are we gonna explain it?

519
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,938
Willie's right. If we go public with this
and we're wrong, that's it.

MAN 1 [ON TV]: The rumors are flying,
the implications extraordinary.

This morning's detection of an unidentified
radio source from deep space...

...can neither be confirmed nor denied.

But the military presence arriving...

538

MAN 2: Sources close to the VLA report
that the planet has been contacted...

...living outside of our solar system.
Again, there is no confirmation...

541
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:21,949
...that the official IAU communiqué
was sent from this government facility.

Twenty-two stations worldwide
now confirming the signal.

00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,838
Vega is currently below our horizon...

00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,466
...so what you're hearing
is the signal from-

00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:42,428
Get decryption people in here now.
Lunacharsky is visiting at Cal Tech.

548
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:44,055
Explain this to me.

549
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:48,142
If the source of the signal is so
sophisticated, why the remedial math?

550
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,103
Exactly, why don't they speak English?

551
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:53,481
Maybe because 70 percent of the planet
speaks other languages.

552
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:56,442
Mathematics is
the only truly universal language.

553
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:59,737
It's no coincidence
that they're using primes.

554
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:02,156
- I don't get it.
- Prime numbers.

555
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:06,119
That would be integers that are
only divisible by themselves and one.

556
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:12,625
We think this may be a beacon,
some kind of an announcement...

557
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:13,918
...to get our attention.

558
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:17,797
If it's attention you want, you got that.
One thing: Vega.

559
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:21,509
People have been looking at Vega for years
with no results.

560
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:24,512
And now yesterday they start
broadcasting primes. Why?

561
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,558
Well, it's hardly yesterday, because the
signal has been transmitting for 26 years.

562
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,184
Dr. Arroway.

563
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:34,564
- Excuse me, who are you?
- Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.

564
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,023
Let me first say that your...

565
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:40,153
Actually, first, could you ask the gentlemen
with the firearms to wait outside?

566
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,321
This is supposed to be a civilian facility.

567
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:51,414
- Doctor, with all due respect to your...
- Excuse me.

568
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:55,126
Hey, hey, hey.
Hi, I'm so glad you're back.

569
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,921
Come on, I got something for you to hear.
Is this great?

570
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,507
- Who are all these people?
- I have no idea.

571
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:04,677
Sit down. And we could use some help
with the spectrum analysis.

572
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,804
- Listen to that. I'll get on it.
- Headsets.

573
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:09,056
So I'll just come right to the point,
shall I?

574
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:13,352
Your having sent this all over the world may
constitute a breach of national security.

575
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,188
This isn't a person-to-person call.

576
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:19,901
You can't think that a civilization sending
this would intend it just for Americans.

577
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:21,903
I'm saying you might have consulted us.

578
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:25,865
- The contents could be extremely sensitive.
- You want to classify prime numbers?

579
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:29,786
Mike, please. We're only in line
with Vega so many hours a day.

580
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:34,415
The only way to monitor the signal
is to get the cooperation of other stations.

581
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:38,961
If Dr. Arroway hadrt acted quickly,
we could have lost key elements.

582
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,755
Okay, fine, they've got the primes.

583
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:44,050
If you're right about there being a more
significant transmission...

584
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,885
Which will need help
to receive and decode.

585
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,887
Doctor, do you understand that my job
is to protect...?

586
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,847
KENT: Shh!
- What?

587
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:52,099
- Listen.
- I hear it.

588
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:54,018
- Hear what?
- Harmonic.

589
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:58,439
Bingo. I had Willie ask Rattan
to retune to 8.9247 gigahertz.

590
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,107
There's a lot more here, folks.

591
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:03,236
- Fish, let's get on the negative sideband.
FISHER: I'm already on it.

592
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:04,987
KITZ: What is going on?
DRUMLIN: Another signal.

593
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,489
Another signal, look at that.

594
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:09,784
A second signal at double the frequency.
It looks like a...

595
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,327
Somebody get a TV monitor.

596
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,955
Patch the recording
into the image processor.

597
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:17,416
- You want the new data?
- Yeah, the new frequency we just recorded.

598
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,544
David, explain this to me, please.

599
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:22,839
With the prime there's another signal.
Looks like a TV transmission.

600
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,173
WILLIE:
We're hot.

601
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:27,426
Do me a favor, go get the blinds.
There is a lot of glare.

602
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:29,095
You're patched in.

603
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:33,432
All right, it's definitely an image.
Let's try and stabilize it.

604
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:38,980
What do you make of that, Fish?

605
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:42,567
It's two different interlaced frames.
I'm framing one.

606
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:48,698
ELLIE: It's just noise.
FISHER: Trying frame two.

607
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:53,202
I've got an offset carrier here.
I think it's audio.

608
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:54,620
Plug it in, plug it in.

609
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,251
Center that segment.

610
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,961
FISHER:
Centering.

611
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:08,801
- Can you clean it up any more than that?
FISHER: I'm working on it.

612
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:23,149
What the hell...?

613
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:25,151
Try zooming out.

614
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,156
All right, freeze.

615
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:31,657
Reverse values.

616
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:35,453
Try zooming out again.

You're not gonna believe this.

...and he's our first ambassador

629
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:42,353
- Actually...
- The broadcast from the '36 Olympics...

630
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:45,523
...was the first television transmission
that went into space.

631
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:49,068
That they recorded it and sent it back
is saying, "Hello, we heard you."

Or, "Sjeg Heil, you're our kind of people."

Good afternoon.

I'm glad to be joined by my
science and technology advisor.

646
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:39,243
This is the product
of years of exploration...

647
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:42,663
...by some of the world's
most distinguished scientists.

648
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:47,084
Like all discoveries, this one
will and should continue to be reviewed...

649
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:50,046
...examined and scrutinized.

650
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:53,340
It must be confirmed by other scientists.

651
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:59,305
The fact that something of this magnitude
is being explored is another...

652
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:03,350
Fish, what is the story over here?
I thought Ellie was supposed to be on.

I don't know.

Guys? Guys? Um...

655
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:12,276
You know those interlaced frames
that we thought were noise?

656
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:15,780
This has structure. I'm hearing structure.

657
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:19,408
If this discovery is confirmed...

658
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:23,245
...it will be one of the most stunning
insights into our universe...

659
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:25,498
...that science has ever uncovered.

660
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:31,170
Its implications are as far-reaching
and awe-inspiring as can be imagined.

661
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:34,840
Even as it promises answers
to some of our oldest questions...

662
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:38,469
...it poses still others,
even more fundamental.

663
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:42,306
We will continue to listen closely
to what it has to say...

664
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:46,060
...as we continue the search for answers
and for knowledge...

665
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:51,941
...that is as old as humanity itself
but essential to our people's future.

I'll answer your questions at the end,
but first a few corrections.

669
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:03,494
The message was received Friday morning,
6:31 a.m. Mountain Standard Time.

670
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:08,290
It was largely mathematical, and in spite of
reports you may have seen to the contrary...

671
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:11,001
...appears to be completely benign

Let me say that again.
The message is completely benign.

with heads of state from around the world...

Thank you, Rachel. Hello.

In 1936
a very faint television signal...

680
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:52,168
...transmitted the opening ceremonies
of the Olympic Games...

681
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:56,005
...as a show
of German superior technology.

682
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,175
That signal left Earth
at the speed of light...

[PHONE RINGING]

...and 26 years later arrived in the vicinity
of the star we call Vega.

685
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:10,102
That signal has been sent back to us
hugely amplified...

686
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:12,938
...an unmistakable sign of intelligence.

687
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:14,607
ELLIE:
You're online, Kent, go ahead.

688
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:18,986
KENT: The Adolf transmission used 25 frames
per second but we're receiving 50.

689
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:23,115
So we canned the other 25
through a series of search algorithms.

690
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:25,826
We found a series of markers
on the top of each frame.

691
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,703
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, go ahead.

692
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:31,123
- Send it, Willie.
WILLIE: Okay, here it comes.

693
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:35,711
KENT:
It's digital...

694
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:40,132
...massive amounts of data which
extend right to the higher harmonics.

695
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,551
Jackpot.

696
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,387
ELLIE:
All right, as you'll see...

697
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:48,849
...interlaced with the frames
of the original Hitler image...

698
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:51,977
...we found these sections.

699
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:55,648
Now, we thought they were just noise,
but they're actually data...

700
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:57,107
...huge amounts of it.

701
00:53:57,275 --> 00:54:01,820
When we combine this with the data from
the amplification of the original signal...

702
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:05,282
...we get these encrypted pages of text.

703
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:09,662
Now, no two are alike and
we've uncovered over 10,000 already.

704
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:12,248
What does it mean, doctor?

705
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,750
Well, we have no idea.
It could be anything.

706
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:17,628
It could be the first volume
of an Encyclopedia Galactica.

707
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:20,714
Instructions to acquaint us
with their colonization procedures.

Moses with a few billion
new commandments.

709
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:25,302
How long will it take to decode it?

710
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:28,847
It could take forever.
We really need a primer...

711
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:32,101
We need to get the best
decryption people we have.

712
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:36,855
I intend to use the VLA
as my command post.

713
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:40,442
In the meantime, my office
has made out a preliminary budget.

714
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:44,571
Wait a minute.
This is a privately-funded operation.

715
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:47,074
We're only leasing dish time
from the government...

716

If there's a more clear case
of eminent domain, I've never seen it.

717
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:53,122
I'm going to recommend
we militarize this project.

718
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,666
What? This is my project.

719
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:59,211
Nobody knows more about these scenarios
than I do. David, tell them...

720
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:02,756
Excuse me, could we calm down here?

721
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:07,636
Now, I'm going to recommend that
Dr. Drumlin coordinate the decryption effort.

722
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:11,181
However, in light of Dr. Arroway's
long experience in these matters...

723
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:15,561
...for the time being, she will continue
to direct operations at the VLA...

724
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:20,399
...understanding that future discoveries
will be kept in strictest confidence...

725
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,484
...until such time as the president...

726
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:26,655
...can decide the most suitable
course of action. Understood?

727
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,032
Yes.

Health officials from around the world are
concerned that the message from Vega...

736

...might trigger a rash of mass suicides...

737

...not unlike the recent cult deaths
near San Diego...

738
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,568
Even a scientist has to admit...

739
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:09,281
...that there are some pretty serious
religious overtones to all this.

Let's hear from someone
whose organization...

741
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:14,370
...has been accused of conducting
its own inquisition:

742
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:17,164
Richard Rank,
head of the Conservative coalition.

743
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:18,415
Thank you.

744
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:22,961
This is yet another example of science
intruding into matters of faith.

745
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:27,299
This means they
have been reacting to TV signals...

746
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:30,427
...they got from the 1930s.
They're just getting them.

Like a bolt from the blue it came.

751

The message from Vega has caused
thousands of believers and non-believers...

...to descend upon the VLA facility
here in the desert of New Mexico.

many to pray...

Buried within the message itself
is the key to decoding it.

863
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:06,980
Within the layering of the matrix,
we have these basic equations:

864
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:12,986
So with this very elementary foundation,
they have given us a kind of...

...we find this.

872

Yes.

875
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:47,312
It is our belief that
the message contains instructions...

876
01:07:47,521 --> 01:07:50,982
...for building something,
some kind of machine.

877
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:54,277
A machine? That does what, doctor?

878
01:07:54,445 --> 01:07:56,654
We don't know.
It might be some type...

879

...of advanced communication device,
or a teaching machine of some kind.

880
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:06,956
Or it might turn out to be
some kind of a transport.

881
01:08:07,374 --> 01:08:09,834
- Transport?
- There's no proof of that.

882
01:08:10,002 --> 01:08:13,838
The fact is, you don't know what it does.
It could be anything.

Could be a Trojan horse. We build it
and out pours the entire Vegan army.

Why bother risking the personnel?
It could be a weapon.

01:08:20,387 --> 01:08:22,680
Right. Some kind of
a doomsday machine.

- We pose no threat to them.

But right now my job is to protect
American lives from any threat.

In that regard, I am obligated
to assume the worst.

Well, yes, and I am forced
to agree with you.

No, of course not. I understand.

911
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:41,426
What I meant to say...

912
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:45,054
...is the message was written
in the language of science.

913
01:09:45,222 --> 01:09:48,600
Now, if it had been religious in nature,
it should have taken the form...

914
01:09:48,767 --> 01:09:51,394
...of a burning bush
or a booming voice from the sky.

915
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:53,688
But a voice from the sky...

916
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:57,609
...is exactly what you found,
Doctor Arroway.

I'm sorry I'm late, ma'am.

918
01:10:03,115 --> 01:10:08,328
Now, I agree with Mr. Rank
that there are unavoidable...

919
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:10,705
...religious implications at stake here.

920
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:13,291
But that doesn't justify
taking an alarmist position.

921
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:18,087
My hope here is that we can find
a common ground...

candidate for the Machine seat...

1076
01:19:49,075 --> 01:19:51,368
...has unexpectedly dropped out
of the running.

1077
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:54,872
Russell met with reporters this afternoon
at his Houston home.

1078
01:19:55,207 --> 01:19:59,168
I told my dad
that I didn't want him to go.

1079

Daddy, don't go.

1080

for the Machine seat.

So is this kosher?
Fraternizing with the enemy?

Selectors and selectees mingling around?

1091

Can we talk about Einstein?

1092
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:41,752
Yeah, sure. Okay.

1093

- Special relativity.
- Yeah.

1094

This machine...

1095
01:20:45,715 --> 01:20:50,636
...now, if it works, and you travel to Vega
at even close to the speed of light...

1096
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:53,305
...when you come back...
- lf you come back.

1097
01:20:55,475 --> 01:20:57,476
If you come back...

1098
01:20:57,644 --> 01:21:01,939
...you'll only be 4 years older, but over
50 years would have passed here on Earth.

1099
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:03,816
Basically, yeah.

1100
01:21:04,317 --> 01:21:06,902
And everybody that you care about...

1101

this isn't dangerous, all right?

The rest of the candidates and myself,
we fully understand the risks we're taking.

Why?

1106

Because it's a historic opportunity.
The world needs...

No, you, Ellie. You. You personally.

1108

By doing this,
you're willing to give your life.

1109
01:21:35,473 --> 01:21:37,641
You're willing to die for it.

1110
01:21:39,477 --> 01:21:40,769
Why?

1111
01:21:44,482 --> 01:21:48,193
From as long as I can remember,
I've been searching for...

1112
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:50,487
...something...

1113
01:21:50,697 --> 01:21:54,491
...some reason why we're here.
What are we doing here? Who are we?

1114
01:21:55,493 --> 01:21:59,371
If this is a chance to find out
even just a little part of that answer...

1115
01:22:00,874 --> 01:22:03,876
I don't know,
I think it's won'th a human life.

Myself, I have one final question,
Dr. Arroway.

1124
01:23:04,062 --> 01:23:06,397
If you should meet these Vegans...

1125
01:23:06,606 --> 01:23:10,901
...and were permitted only
one question to ask of them...

1126
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:12,736
...what would it be?

1127
01:23:14,197 --> 01:23:16,240
Well, I suppose it would be:

1128
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:18,075
"How did you do it?

1129
01:23:18,618 --> 01:23:23,080
How did you evolve? How did you
survive this technological adolescence...

1130
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:25,165
...without destroying yourself?"

1131

I personally would like to have answered.

Madam Chairman,
I have one more question.

1139
01:23:49,065 --> 01:23:50,816
Yes, Mr. Joss.

1140
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:53,444
Dr. Arroway...

1141
01:23:54,821 --> 01:23:57,156
Would you consider yourself...

1142
01:23:57,657 --> 01:24:00,284
...a spiritual person?

1143
01:24:02,954 --> 01:24:04,705
Uh...

1144
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:08,792
I don't really understand
the point of the question.

1145
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:11,837
I consider myself a moral person.

1146
01:24:12,005 --> 01:24:13,964
PATEL:
I'm sure we all agree that is the case...

1147
01:24:14,132 --> 01:24:16,633
...but I think what Mr. Joss
is in fact asking...

1148
01:24:16,801 --> 01:24:18,635
Do you believe in God...

1149
01:24:20,638 --> 01:24:22,639
...Dr. Arroway?

1150
01:24:27,145 --> 01:24:29,563
As a scientist...

1151
01:24:29,731 --> 01:24:33,192
...I rely on empirical evidence,
and in this matter...

1152
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:37,071
...I don't believe
that there is data either way.

1153
01:24:37,655 --> 01:24:42,076
PATEL: So your answer would in fact be
that you don't believe in God.

1154
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:48,540
I don't understand the relevance
of the question.

1155
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:54,379
Dr. Arroway,
95 percent of the world's population...

1156
01:24:54,547 --> 01:24:58,509
...believes in a supreme being
in one form or another.

1157
01:24:59,677 --> 01:25:02,888
I believe that makes the question
more than relevant.

1158
01:25:05,558 --> 01:25:07,267
PATEL:
Dr. Arroway?

1159
01:25:17,195 --> 01:25:19,196
I believe, um...

1160
01:25:23,201 --> 01:25:25,702
I believe I've already
answered that question.

1161

I'm proud of what
we've achieved as a species...

1378
01:41:24,161 --> 01:41:27,288
...wholly-owned subsidiaries...

1379
01:41:27,456 --> 01:41:29,832
...of Hadden Industries.
- Of Hadden Industries.

1380
01:41:33,003 --> 01:41:36,172
They still want
an American to go, doctor.

1381
01:41:39,802 --> 01:41:42,136
Wanna take a ride?

1382
01:42:24,263 --> 01:42:28,558
WOMAN: And augmenting our restraint and
communications console subsystem...

1383
01:42:28,725 --> 01:42:30,726
...we have your personal recording unit.

1384
01:42:30,894 --> 01:42:35,022
Normal, infrared and ultraviolet lenses.

1385
01:42:35,190 --> 01:42:39,235
Digital microchip good for
thousands of hours of recording.

1386
01:42:40,445 --> 01:42:42,530
Okay, look, I understand...

1387
01:42:42,698 --> 01:42:46,117
...the reason for recording
and documenting the mission.

1388
01:42:46,285 --> 01:42:49,120
But I just... I wanna go on record
one more time.

1389
01:42:49,288 --> 01:42:52,790
The transmitted specs
never said anything about any chair...

1390
01:42:53,041 --> 01:42:57,545
...or a restraining harness or survival gear.

1391
01:42:57,713 --> 01:42:59,547
Why can't we just trust the original...?

1392
01:42:59,715 --> 01:43:03,843
Doctor, both the IMC Board
and the SI team reviewed the matter...

1393
01:43:04,052 --> 01:43:07,805
...and concluded that
the design impact is negligible.

1394
01:43:07,973 --> 01:43:09,682
Bottom line is...

1395
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:12,185
...we're not putting anybody
aboard this machine...

1396
01:43:12,394 --> 01:43:15,396
...unless there is
some sort of minimal protection.

1397
01:43:15,564 --> 01:43:17,440
End of story.

1398
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:23,112
- Okay.
MAN: Ellie...

1399
01:43:23,989 --> 01:43:28,075
...we've been giving these to the astronauts
since the beginning of the space program.

1400
01:43:29,411 --> 01:43:31,704
It's never been made public, of course.

1401
01:43:31,914 --> 01:43:33,998
It's fast and it's painless.

1402
01:43:36,752 --> 01:43:39,629
I'm gonna travel 26 light years
to commit suicide?

1403
01:43:39,796 --> 01:43:42,006
Something may go wrong.

1404
01:43:42,174 --> 01:43:44,926
There may be
an unforeseen mechanical failure.

1405
01:43:45,677 --> 01:43:48,763
You could be marooned, unable to return.

1406
01:43:49,932 --> 01:43:53,059
There are a thousand reasons
we can think of for you to have this...

1407
01:43:53,268 --> 01:43:56,437
...but mostly it's for the reasons
we can't think of.

1408
01:44:21,505 --> 01:44:22,546
[KNOCKING]

1409
01:44:22,714 --> 01:44:23,839
Come in.

1410
01:44:25,384 --> 01:44:29,387
- Dr. Arroway, time to get ready.
- Thank you.

1411
01:44:40,065 --> 01:44:41,774
I know you don't have much time.

1412
01:44:41,942 --> 01:44:45,027
As soon as I found out about the Machine,
I called the president.

1413
01:44:45,237 --> 01:44:47,321
I came with Kitz.

1414
01:44:47,489 --> 01:44:49,782
I had to see you one more time.

1415
01:44:49,950 --> 01:44:51,701
- Oh, God, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1416
01:44:51,868 --> 01:44:53,744
No, I'm glad you came.

1417
01:44:53,912 --> 01:44:56,789
There's something I gotta say to you.

1418
01:44:57,666 --> 01:45:01,919
The reason I didn't vote for you to go was
a good reason, but it wasrt the real one.

1419
01:45:03,005 --> 01:45:05,006
I didn't vote for you to go...

1420
01:45:06,550 --> 01:45:08,718
...because I don't wanna lose you.

1421
01:45:09,761 --> 01:45:12,596
You find your way home, all right?

1422
01:45:28,989 --> 01:45:30,406
Twenty-three hours ago...

1423
01:45:30,574 --> 01:45:34,618
...the world was stunned by the
announcement of a second Machine...

1424
01:45:34,786 --> 01:45:37,913
...and its passenger,
Eleanor Ann Arroway.

1425
01:45:38,123 --> 01:45:41,709
Now the question
that's on everyone's mind:

1426
01:45:41,877 --> 01:45:43,878
Will history repeat itself?

1427
01:45:44,046 --> 01:45:46,339
With a piece of engineering
this complex...

1428
01:45:46,506 --> 01:45:50,593
...with so many unknowns,
could the unthinkable occur?

1429
01:45:50,761 --> 01:45:54,221
The security in Hokkaido
has been incredibly tight.

1430
01:45:54,389 --> 01:45:57,725
No reporters whatsoever
have been allowed near the site.

1431
01:48:19,701 --> 01:48:21,702
Thanks.

1432
01:48:38,261 --> 01:48:41,263
Magnetic restraint is secure.
All life support functions normal.

1433
01:48:41,473 --> 01:48:44,642
Roger that. Ellie, this is Control.
Do you copy?

1434
01:48:44,809 --> 01:48:47,144
Ellie to Control, reading you five-by-five.

1435
01:48:47,312 --> 01:48:51,398
- Comm 1, Give me Ellie's PRD.
- Video unit recording and transmitting.

1436
01:48:52,359 --> 01:48:54,902
- Are you reading me?
STEVE: That's affirmative.

1437
01:48:55,070 --> 01:48:57,363
Video looks good.

1438
01:48:57,531 --> 01:49:00,074
- Copy that, Control.
- Okay.

1439
01:49:00,242 --> 01:49:03,118
Ellie, we're gonna proceed
to button you up.

1440
01:49:03,286 --> 01:49:05,955
Roger, Control. I'm ready.

1441
01:49:09,376 --> 01:49:11,752
- Dynamics...
- I can confirm the walkway retraction.

1442
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:12,920
STEVE: Systems?
MAN 1: Go.

1443
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:14,463
STEVE: Communications?
MAN 2: Go.

1444
01:49:14,631 --> 01:49:16,298
STEVE: Life support?
WOMAN: Go.

1445
01:49:16,466 --> 01:49:18,759
Ellie, we are go for closure.

1446
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:22,096
I'm go here.

1447
01:49:22,973 --> 01:49:26,475
STEVE: Mechanical, initiate
IPV closure sequence.

1448
01:49:28,103 --> 01:49:30,312
Hold on, let me get you a chair.

1449
01:49:31,022 --> 01:49:32,064
ELLIE:
I'm go.

1450
01:49:32,232 --> 01:49:36,110
- It's nice to smell you again, Mr. Kitz.
- You too.

1451
01:49:36,278 --> 01:49:38,112
Wouldrt peg him as a Polo man.

1452
01:49:47,664 --> 01:49:48,998
I got a visual on the door.

1453
01:49:49,165 --> 01:49:51,125
WOMAN:
IPV escape system is armed.

1454
01:49:51,293 --> 01:49:53,294
Door is looking good.

1455
01:49:58,508 --> 01:50:00,175
Door alignment looks good.

1456
01:50:28,788 --> 01:50:30,873
Ellie, we are showing green
across the board.

1457
01:50:31,041 --> 01:50:34,376
Copy that, Control. IPV is secure.

1458
01:50:41,509 --> 01:50:43,510
GERRY:
We are at 30 percent.

1459
01:50:43,678 --> 01:50:44,970
Copy that, 30 percent.

1460
01:50:49,851 --> 01:50:52,519
- How you doing in there, EI?
- Kent?

1461
01:50:53,271 --> 01:50:56,065
- Is that you?
- That's a big affirmative.

1462
01:50:56,983 --> 01:50:58,567
Who let you in there, huh?

1463
01:50:58,735 --> 01:51:00,861
A higher power intervened.

1464
01:51:02,906 --> 01:51:04,239
Well, I'm glad you came.

1465
01:51:08,995 --> 01:51:10,162
GERRY:
Thirty-five percent.

1466
01:51:10,914 --> 01:51:12,414
Copy that, 35 percent.

1467
01:51:12,582 --> 01:51:13,916
- Mechanical?
- We're good.

1468
01:51:14,084 --> 01:51:15,417
Forty percent.

1469
01:51:19,047 --> 01:51:20,923
I'm picking up a moderate vibration here.

1470
01:51:22,092 --> 01:51:25,719
- Dynamics, can you confirm vibration?
GERRY: Everything looks good here.

1471
01:51:25,929 --> 01:51:29,181
She's feeling the same thing
they felt at the Cape at this point.

1472
01:51:29,349 --> 01:51:30,933
Ellie, the vibration is normal.

1473
01:51:31,101 --> 01:51:33,602
GERRY: We are at 50 percent.
All systems nominal.

1474
01:51:33,770 --> 01:51:35,771
Copy that, 50 percent.

1475
01:51:40,944 --> 01:51:42,945
Vibration is getting a little stronger now.

1476
01:51:43,113 --> 01:51:45,948
We're picking up
some low-frequency noise.

1477
01:51:46,324 --> 01:51:49,410
- Mechanical, can you confirm?
- It looks fine to me.

1478
01:51:49,577 --> 01:51:52,955
STEVE: Roger. Gerry, what do you think?
- I'm still go.

1479
01:51:53,123 --> 01:51:54,748
People, we are still go.

1480
01:51:56,501 --> 01:51:58,961
What...? Something's happening.

1481
01:52:00,213 --> 01:52:02,881
I'm... There's...

1482
01:52:03,049 --> 01:52:05,884
There's a light. Do you see that?
I'm seeing some...

1483
01:52:06,636 --> 01:52:09,096
Something, some...

1484
01:52:09,264 --> 01:52:11,807
I can't tell whether it's daylight or not.

1485
01:52:11,975 --> 01:52:14,893
There it is again.
It's coming from the bottom.

1486
01:52:15,937 --> 01:52:17,479
Here, let me show you. See that?

1487
01:52:17,647 --> 01:52:19,565
Negative. Ellie, you're breaking up.

1488
01:52:19,733 --> 01:52:22,568
- Comm 1, can we boost her signal?
- Already at maximum.

1489
01:52:22,736 --> 01:52:24,278
GERRY:
Sixty-five percent.

1490
01:52:24,446 --> 01:52:26,155
The material is changing.

1491
01:52:26,322 --> 01:52:29,825
It's bordering on translucence.
But the system is intact.

1492
01:52:33,121 --> 01:52:37,499
It's gotta be some kind
of electromagnetic field.

1493
01:52:37,667 --> 01:52:40,669
- Are you reading this?
- Negative, we're seeing only interference.

1494
01:52:40,837 --> 01:52:46,175
It's becoming completely translucent.
I can't describe it. I can't even explain it.

1495
01:52:48,636 --> 01:52:49,678
Seventy percent.

1496
01:52:49,846 --> 01:52:52,181
People, we have intermittent comm,
but we are go.

1497
01:52:52,348 --> 01:52:56,810
- Initiate secondary drive systems.
GERRY: Initiating auxiliary booster sequence.

1498
01:52:57,020 --> 01:52:58,854
MAN:
We're go for ignition.

1499
01:53:05,904 --> 01:53:08,363
We have auxiliary booster ignition.

1500
01:53:14,037 --> 01:53:15,537
Life support, how is she doing?

1501
01:53:15,705 --> 01:53:18,957
We still have data. Heart and respiration
are high but within limits.

1502
01:53:19,125 --> 01:53:20,209
Ellie, do you copy?

1503
01:53:20,418 --> 01:53:23,420
If you could hear, I am okay to go.

1504
01:53:27,217 --> 01:53:29,009
If you could hear me...

1505
01:53:32,096 --> 01:53:33,472
Eighty percent.

1506
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:36,475
All vibration and G-levels are in the green.

1507
01:53:41,898 --> 01:53:44,233
Control, if you're reading me...

1508
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:46,735
...I am okay to go. Okay to go,

1509
01:53:46,903 --> 01:53:50,697
GERRY: Eighty-five percent.
MAN: All bearing tips are on the profile.

1510
01:53:51,574 --> 01:53:54,660
Ninety percent. We're detecting
some structural instability.

1511
01:53:54,828 --> 01:53:58,747
- Confirmed. Is she holding?
- We're within limits, barely.

1512
01:54:00,250 --> 01:54:06,171
I'm okay to go.

1513
01:54:12,095 --> 01:54:13,554
My God!

1514
01:54:24,607 --> 01:54:27,109
Okay to go. I'm okay.

1515
01:54:27,527 --> 01:54:29,027
Hundred percent target velocity.

1516
01:54:29,195 --> 01:54:30,404
MAN:
Steve?

1517
01:54:30,572 --> 01:54:34,950
Tremendous EMI levels around the Machine.
All field measurements are off-scale.

1518
01:54:35,118 --> 01:54:37,578
Steve, we're approaching our abort limits.

1519
01:54:39,956 --> 01:54:41,039
Okay to go.

1520
01:54:46,254 --> 01:54:47,462
I hear her!

1521
01:54:47,630 --> 01:54:50,465
I hear her. Barely, but she's there.

1522
01:54:50,633 --> 01:54:53,635
- Okay to go.
- She says she's okay to go.

1523
01:54:56,639 --> 01:54:58,765
Steve, we're real close.

1524
01:54:58,933 --> 01:55:01,810
- Electrical, reading in the core?
MAN: Internal environment normal.

1525
01:55:01,978 --> 01:55:04,980
Inside the core, the weather's beautiful.

1526
01:55:09,068 --> 01:55:10,319
I'm okay to go.

1527
01:55:10,820 --> 01:55:14,281
Okay to go. I'm okay to go.

1528
01:55:14,866 --> 01:55:17,200
STEVE:
Initiate drop sequence.

1529
01:55:19,787 --> 01:55:21,496
On my mark.

1530
01:55:22,206 --> 01:55:24,750
Ten, nine...

1531
01:55:25,835 --> 01:55:27,836
...eight...

1532
01:55:28,171 --> 01:55:31,173
...seven, six...

1533
01:55:31,341 --> 01:55:33,967
...five, four...

1534
01:55:34,135 --> 01:55:36,803
...three, two...

1535
01:55:36,971 --> 01:55:38,347
I'm okay to go.

1536
01:55:42,310 --> 01:55:44,102
Oh, God!

1537
01:55:53,363 --> 01:55:55,030
Ellie to Control.

1538
01:55:55,698 --> 01:56:05,749
Ellie to Control, do you read me?

1539
01:56:11,506 --> 01:56:14,925
I'm gonna try to keep recording.

1540
01:56:15,677 --> 01:56:20,222
I'm going through
some kind of a tunnel.

1541
01:56:34,904 --> 01:56:36,446
There's a light source ahead.

1542
01:56:36,948 --> 01:56:40,158
Brilliant and blue-white.

1543
01:56:41,369 --> 01:56:42,995
Residual radiation?

1544
01:56:54,757 --> 01:56:56,049
It's a star.

1545
01:56:56,634 --> 01:57:00,053
I must have gone through a wormhole.

1546
01:57:05,101 --> 01:57:06,518
It's Vega.

1547
01:57:17,739 --> 01:57:19,281
I'm in another wormhole now.

1548
01:57:22,952 --> 01:57:24,077
I had no idea.

1549
01:57:24,245 --> 01:57:26,038
A series of them.

1550
01:57:29,042 --> 01:57:30,292
They're alive.

1551
01:57:30,460 --> 01:57:34,421
It's like some kind of a transit system.

1552
01:57:35,423 --> 01:57:36,798
It's a subway.

1553
01:57:36,966 --> 01:57:38,467
[YELLS]

1554
01:57:42,138 --> 01:57:43,930
Okay.

1555
01:57:44,098 --> 01:57:46,391
Okay, I've gotta keep talking.

1556
01:57:48,936 --> 01:57:52,814
It's a triple... No, quadruple system.

1557
01:57:53,232 --> 01:57:54,483
It's beautiful.

1558
01:57:57,820 --> 01:57:59,237
They're alive.

1559
01:58:07,413 --> 01:58:09,081
Another wormhole!

1560
01:58:09,415 --> 01:58:11,249
This one is much more violent!

1561
01:59:44,677 --> 01:59:46,344
Some...

1562
01:59:46,804 --> 01:59:49,139
...celestial event...

1563
01:59:50,391 --> 01:59:52,100
No...

1564
01:59:52,268 --> 01:59:55,937
No words. No words...

1565
01:59:57,607 --> 01:59:59,816
...to describe it.

1566
02:00:01,235 --> 02:00:03,111
Poetry.

1567
02:00:04,280 --> 02:00:07,782
They should have sent a poet.

1568
02:00:08,075 --> 02:00:10,660
It's so beautiful.

1569
02:00:10,828 --> 02:00:12,287
Beautiful.

1570
02:00:14,123 --> 02:00:19,419
So beautiful.

1571
02:00:20,296 --> 02:00:26,885
I had no idea.

1572
02:00:28,137 --> 02:00:31,473
I had no...

1573
02:00:32,767 --> 02:00:36,061
I had no idea.

1574
02:00:37,396 --> 02:00:44,402
I had no idea. I had no idea.

1575
02:03:02,375 --> 02:03:03,750
Hi, Sparks.

1576
02:03:05,628 --> 02:03:07,128
Dad?

1577
02:03:14,595 --> 02:03:16,471
I missed you.

1578
02:03:22,103 --> 02:03:23,269
Arert you...?

1579
02:03:23,479 --> 02:03:26,689
I'm sorry I couldn't
be there for you, sweetheart.

1580
02:03:36,492 --> 02:03:38,159
You're not real.

1581
02:03:39,662 --> 02:03:41,162
None of this is real.

1582
02:03:41,330 --> 02:03:43,498
That's my scientist.

1583
02:03:44,583 --> 02:03:48,962
When I was unconscious, you downloaded
my thoughts, my memory even.

1584
02:03:49,797 --> 02:03:51,840
Pensacola.

1585
02:03:54,343 --> 02:03:57,303
We thought this might
make things easier for you.

1586
02:04:10,818 --> 02:04:14,446
- Why did you contact us?
- You contacted us.

1587
02:04:14,613 --> 02:04:16,281
We were just listening.

1588
02:04:17,158 --> 02:04:18,450
And there are others?

1589
02:04:18,617 --> 02:04:20,243
Many others.

1590
02:04:25,082 --> 02:04:26,583
They all...

1591
02:04:26,750 --> 02:04:29,878
...travel here through that
transit system that you built?

1592
02:04:30,421 --> 02:04:31,921
We didn't build it.

1593
02:04:33,090 --> 02:04:34,591
We don't know who did.

1594
02:04:36,677 --> 02:04:39,637
No, they were gone
long before we ever got here.

1595
02:04:40,264 --> 02:04:42,098
Maybe someday they'll come back.

1596
02:04:42,933 --> 02:04:45,643
All the other civilizations that you find,
they come here?

1597
02:04:45,853 --> 02:04:47,061
Not all.

1598
02:04:48,856 --> 02:04:52,025
- Is this some test?
- No, no tests.

1599
02:04:54,945 --> 02:04:56,529
You have your mother's hands.

1600
02:05:06,707 --> 02:05:08,875
You're an interesting species...

1601
02:05:09,543 --> 02:05:11,503
...an interesting mix.

1602
02:05:12,421 --> 02:05:15,215
You're capable of
such beautiful dreams...

1603
02:05:16,258 --> 02:05:18,718
...and such horrible nightmares.

1604
02:05:19,887 --> 02:05:21,721
You feel so lost...

1605
02:05:22,306 --> 02:05:25,266
...so cut off, so alone.

1606
02:05:26,727 --> 02:05:28,478
Only you're not.

1607
02:05:30,564 --> 02:05:32,106
See...

1608
02:05:32,566 --> 02:05:34,192
In all our searching...

1609
02:05:34,401 --> 02:05:37,904
...the only thing we've found
that makes the emptiness bearable...

1610
02:05:38,072 --> 02:05:39,697
...is each other.

1611
02:05:43,452 --> 02:05:45,370
What happens now?

1612
02:05:46,413 --> 02:05:47,914
Now?

1613
02:05:48,832 --> 02:05:50,625
You go home.

1614
02:05:50,793 --> 02:05:52,210
ELLIE:
Home?

1615
02:05:52,378 --> 02:05:55,463
But I have so many questions.

1616
02:05:55,631 --> 02:05:57,757
Do we get to come back?

1617
02:05:58,634 --> 02:06:00,885
This was just a first step.

1618
02:06:01,053 --> 02:06:02,804
In time, you'll take another.

1619
02:06:04,390 --> 02:06:06,766
But other people need to see
what I've seen...

1620
02:06:06,934 --> 02:06:09,978
This is the way it's been done
for billions of years.

1621
02:06:11,981 --> 02:06:14,607
- But l...
- Small moves, Ellie.

1622
02:06:16,068 --> 02:06:17,986
Small moves.

1623
02:07:01,071 --> 02:07:02,864
We've got video on Ellie.
Five-by-five.

1624
02:07:03,073 --> 02:07:04,949
STEVE:
She's through! She is in the net.

1625
02:07:05,117 --> 02:07:08,119
She's alive. Get the White House.
Get the president on the phone.

1626
02:07:08,287 --> 02:07:10,663
What's going on, Steve? How is she?
How is she?

1627
02:07:10,831 --> 02:07:12,540
STEVE:
Ellie, this is Control. Do you copy?

1628
02:07:12,708 --> 02:07:14,751
KENT: What's going on?
- I don't know. Hang on.

1629
02:07:14,918 --> 02:07:16,544
- She is alive.
STEVE: Put her on the PA.

1630
02:07:16,712 --> 02:07:18,296
Ellie, just hold on tight.

1631
02:07:18,922 --> 02:07:22,216
We're still trying to determine
the nature of the malfunction...

1632
02:07:22,384 --> 02:07:24,886
...but the important thing is you're okay.

1633
02:07:25,054 --> 02:07:26,220
What?

1634
02:07:26,388 --> 02:07:30,183
It's all right, Ellie.
The important thing is that you're safe.

1635
02:07:31,143 --> 02:07:33,436
What malfunction?

1636
02:07:34,772 --> 02:07:36,230
What...?

1637
02:07:37,399 --> 02:07:39,025
What happened?

1638
02:07:40,361 --> 02:07:42,028
What day is this?

1639
02:07:42,696 --> 02:07:45,698
I'm sorry, Ellie,
did you say what day?

1640
02:07:46,784 --> 02:07:49,035
How long was I gone?

1641
02:07:50,788 --> 02:07:55,583
Ellie, the IPV dropped
straight through the Machine.

1642
02:07:55,751 --> 02:07:57,418
You didn't go anywhere.

1643
02:07:58,295 --> 02:08:01,631
But I did. I did go.

1644
02:08:01,799 --> 02:08:04,175
That's what I've been trying
to tell everyone.

1645
02:08:08,639 --> 02:08:11,724
But the headset
didn't record a single image?

1646
02:08:11,892 --> 02:08:14,519
Just this. Static.

1647
02:08:14,728 --> 02:08:15,770
Thank you.

1648
02:08:15,938 --> 02:08:19,357
Now, doctor, let me show you
what we saw.

1649
02:08:28,826 --> 02:08:32,662
Forty-three separate remote cameras
show exactly the same event.

1650
02:08:32,830 --> 02:08:34,372
The IPV dropped straight through.

1651
02:08:34,540 --> 02:08:38,126
Everyone who watched
saw exactly the same thing.

1652
02:08:38,293 --> 02:08:40,128
Nothing happened.

1653
02:08:41,463 --> 02:08:43,756
How do you explain this, doctor?

1654
02:08:45,759 --> 02:08:46,884
I can't.

1655
02:08:47,094 --> 02:08:48,553
CLINTON:
I would encourage you...

1656
02:08:50,347 --> 02:08:54,517
...not to inflame this situation
beyond the facts.

1657
02:08:54,685 --> 02:08:58,104
Let us deal with this on the facts.

1658
02:08:58,272 --> 02:09:01,149
We are monitoring
what has actually happened.

1659
02:09:01,316 --> 02:09:06,654
We are taking what we believe
is factually appropriate steps.

1660
02:09:06,822 --> 02:09:10,032
Amid a flurry of accusations
and counter-accusations...

1661
02:09:10,242 --> 02:09:12,827
...by the nations representing
the Machine Consortium...

1662
02:09:12,995 --> 02:09:15,913
...the president has ordered
a special inquiry.

1663
02:09:16,123 --> 02:09:18,916
However, the appointment
to the committee of Michael Kitz...

1664
02:09:19,126 --> 02:09:21,961
...who has recently resigned
as National Security Advisor...

1665
02:09:22,129 --> 02:09:24,464
...has raised a number of eyebrows
on Capitol Hill.

1666
02:09:24,631 --> 02:09:28,426
I have made no decision to run for
Congress, I have announced no candidacy.

1667
02:09:28,594 --> 02:09:31,179
The fact that I resigned
as National Security Advisor...

1668
02:09:31,346 --> 02:09:33,055
...has nothing to do with anything...

1669
02:09:33,223 --> 02:09:36,392
...other than I want to devote
all of my energy to this inquiry.

1670
02:09:37,144 --> 02:09:41,814
The people of the world have a right
to know what really happened.

1671
02:09:42,649 --> 02:09:45,151
And yet every scientific
instrument confirms...

1672
02:09:45,319 --> 02:09:49,489
...the IPV was out of contact
for only a fraction of a second.

1673
02:09:49,656 --> 02:09:51,699
Isn't that correct, doctor?

1674
02:09:53,410 --> 02:09:55,703
A fraction of a second Earth time, yes.

1675
02:09:56,580 --> 02:09:57,830
SENATOR:
Earth time?

1676
02:09:57,998 --> 02:10:01,626
ELLIE: Senator, I believe that the Machine
opened up a wormhole...

1677
02:10:01,794 --> 02:10:06,756
...a tunnel through the fabric of space-time,
also known as an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

1678
02:10:06,924 --> 02:10:11,052
Now, because of the effects of general
relativity, what I experienced as 18 hours...

1679
02:10:11,220 --> 02:10:13,471
...passed instantaneously on Earth.

1680
02:10:13,639 --> 02:10:17,975
Isn't it true that these wormholes you
speak of are merely theoretical predictions?

1681
02:10:18,143 --> 02:10:20,895
There is no evidence
they actually exist, is there?

1682
02:10:21,063 --> 02:10:22,772
ELLIE:
There is no direct evidence, no.

1683
02:10:22,940 --> 02:10:24,690
KITZ:
Tell me something, doctor...

1684
02:10:24,858 --> 02:10:27,985
...why do you think these aliens
would go to all this trouble?

1685
02:10:28,153 --> 02:10:32,365
Bring you tens of thousands of light years
and then send you home without proof?

1686
02:10:33,033 --> 02:10:35,743
They said that's how it's been done
for billions of years.

1687
02:10:36,119 --> 02:10:39,705
KITZ: That's very neat. You have no proof
because they didn't want you to have any.

1688
02:10:39,873 --> 02:10:44,627
A phenomenon known in psychiatric circles,
I believe, as a self-reinforcing delusion.

1689
02:10:45,212 --> 02:10:46,838

some kind of an episode. Yeah, I do.

1691
02:10:51,301 --> 02:10:54,178
Doctor, I'd like to propose
an alternate hypothesis...

1692
02:10:54,388 --> 02:10:58,057
...and I'd like you to bring
your scientific expertise to bear on it.

1693
02:10:58,225 --> 02:11:01,435
To fake a signal from Vega...

...what would you need?

02:11:05,399 --> 02:11:09,193
You would need a satellite to transmit
the signal, but it would be impossible to...

1696
02:11:09,361 --> 02:11:13,281
You'd need a satellite and need launch
capabilities to put the satellite into orbit.

1697
02:11:13,448 --> 02:11:16,659
And the message itself.
To put something like this together...

1698
02:11:16,827 --> 02:11:19,120
...so complex,
drawing on many disciplines...

Lmpossible?

Is there anyone who might
have been up to the challenge?

Someone with extraordinary
technical expertise...

That he engineered this?

KITZ:
S. R. Hadden...

1711
02:11:53,989 --> 02:11:58,868
...a legendary power broker and manipulator
in perhaps his final bid for immortality.

1712
02:11:59,036 --> 02:12:01,704
Maybe he wanted to explore
and exploit new technologies...

02:12:01,872 --> 02:12:04,081
...and get the governments
to pick up the tab.

1714
02:12:04,291 --> 02:12:07,043
Perhaps this was his
final altruistic gesture...

...to unite the world in some common goal.
Maybe all of the above.

with the scientific precept...

Yes.

It means that all things being equal...

tends to be the right one.

KITZ:
Exactly.

Now, you tell me.
What is more likely here?

Wait a minute, let me get this straight.

You admit you have absolutely no
physical evidence to back up your story?

Yes.

You admit that you very well may have
hallucinated this whole thing?

- Yes.
- You admit that if you were in our position...

Yes.

Then why don't you simply withdraw
your testimony and concede...

...that this journey to the center of
