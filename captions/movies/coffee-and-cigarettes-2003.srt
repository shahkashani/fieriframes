1
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,996
Yeah, hello. You're Steve?

2
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:14,063
Steven. Hi.

3
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:16,293
- Sit down.
- Roberto?

4
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,109
- I'm all wound up.
- Yeah.

5
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,336
You're wound up? I'm wound up, too.

6
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,942
- Yes.
- All wound up.

7
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,842
- What are you drinking? Coffee?
- Coffee, yes.

8
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,181
- Very good for me. For you?
- I love coffee.

9
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,652
- You love it, too?
- I love it.

10
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:38,290
- Steve.
- Steven.

11
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,094
I love coffee.

12
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,520
What do you do?

13
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:48,827
You know, I just relax, sit around,
maybe have a cigarette.

14
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:52,030
Cigarettes and coffee
I think go together good.

15
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,537
You think you drink too much of it?

16
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,268
No. Coffee is good for health.

17
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,979
I like to drink before I go to sleep.

18
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:03,207
I drink a lot of coffee before I go to sleep
so I can dream faster.

19
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,977
I can dream like when they put a camera
on the Indy 500...

20
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:09,452
when they put a camera in the car,
and it's just whipping by like that.

21
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,614
Dream after dream after dream after dream.

22
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:14,158
People ask me the next day,
what did you dream about?

23
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,990
I say, I don't have time.
I don't have time to tell you this.

24
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:27,969
- Do you smoke?
- Only when I drink coffee.

25
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,006
Do you know my mother?

26
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:34,847
- Do I know your mother?
- Yeah.

27
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,243
I don't know. I don't think so.

28
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:41,351
- Coffee. They should freeze it, you know?
- Yes.

29
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:45,048
Fill an ice-cube tray with coffee
and put sticks in it, for kids.

30
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,422
So they can start when they're kids,
when they're playing and stuff.

31
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:51,189
Like a Popsicle. A caffeine Popsicle.

32
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,196
Very good. I don't understand nothing. Yes.

33
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,415
- Can you hear me?
- What?

34
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,383
Can you hear me? It's very loud over here.

35
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,921
You having trouble hearing me?
Maybe we should switch.

36
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,354
Yes, thank you very much. I'd like to switch.

37
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,063
Good here.

38
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:36,403
- Good?
- I kind of liked it better over there.

39
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:39,544
- You go...
- Do you mind?

40
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:41,738
Yes, me, too. I prefer, yes.

41
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:48,885
Steve, yes.

42
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,728
- When do you leave?
- The United States?

43
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:05,098
No, here.

44
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:09,265
I have to leave soon, actually.
I have a dentist appointment.

45
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:14,672
But I don't want to go.
I don't like the dentist.

46
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,312
I gotta go, I guess.

47
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,318
- Yes.
- I haven't gone in a while.

48
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,947
Good. You don't go?

49
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:30,988
- I should go, but I don't feel like going.
- No?

50
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:38,333
I am free, very free.

51
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,501
You wanna go for me?

52
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:43,268
Thank you very much.

53
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,707
- You wanna go to the dentist?
- Yes, I can go for you.

54
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:46,971
Great.

55
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:49,972
- Here's the address.
- Good.

56
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:52,310
Good. Very good.

57
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,612
- The name of the guy.
- Yeah, 4:30.

58
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:59,156
- Steven, thank you very much.
- No problem.

59
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,484
- You don't mind?
- No, thank you.

60
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,890
Dentist appointment, very good.

61
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,227
I have to go. I am sorry, Steve.

62
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,198
Steve, I have to go to the dentist. I am late.

63
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,168
- Thank you, excuse me. Sorry.
- Take it easy, don't be late.

64
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:20,841
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too, in a way.

65
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,517
What are we doing in Memphis, anyway?

66
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,926
- It was your idea to come here.
- Your idea.

67
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,463
It was my idea? It was your idea.

68
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,772
Very funny.

69
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,581
Don't smoke those sawdust cigarettes
in here.

70
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,253
I hate those things.

71
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,319
- So what?
- What are you, a cowboy?

72
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,981
- These are fresh. This is fresh tobacco.
- No, this is fresh.

73
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,756
- This is the stupid dope fresh cigarettes.
- That stuff is stale. What are you, crazy?

74
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,233
- I'm not crazy.
- Shut up.

75
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,764
How we doing here? Need a refill?

76
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,169
- Yeah.
- No.

77
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,973
- Sir?
- Yes.

78
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,678
Shit. I'm sorry.

79
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:13,290
- Come on, what are you doing, man?
- Damn, I'm sorry about that.

80
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:17,260
Let's not even pay the check.
This place is terrible.

81
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,291
This all you're gonna have?

82
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,764
- Give me a light.
- Just coffee and cigarettes?

83
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:24,801
That's not too healthy, is it now?

84
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,804
- Can I get you a sandwich or something?
- No.

85
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:30,469
- Y'all from around here?
- No.

86
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,210
Are you brother and sister?

87
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,608
- Yes.
- No.

88
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,381
Are you two twins?

89
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:39,779
- Yes.
- No.

90
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,384
Yes, we are.

91
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,881
I thought so.
You know who y'all remind me of?

92
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,025
- Who?
- Heckle and Jeckle.

93
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,620
Shit.

94
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,892
You know, the talking magpies?

95
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:58,966
Anyway, who's the evil twin?
That's the way it works, right?

96
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,165
- This coffee tastes like mud.
- Really.

97
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,677
Which one of us do you think
looks like the evil one?

98
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:12,407
I'd say he's the evil one, right?
He's got the evil eye.

99
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,853
- I'm only kidding.
- You better be.

100
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:21,016
You know, I just thought of something,
with you two being twins and all.

101
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:23,594
- Did y'all go to Graceland yet?
- No.

102
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,424
You should. It's real cool.

103
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:27,896
- Mind if I sit down?
- Yes, I do.

104
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:31,162
Yes, you can sit down.
What are you, on a break?

105
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:35,162
Not really, but it's kind of slow.
Tell you what, you can help me out.

106
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:39,368
Just stay right there. You got me covered
and my boss can't see me.

107
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:43,073
It's his evil nature, right?

108
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,945
Anyway, what I just thought of,

109
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:49,088
do you know that
Elvis Presley's got a twin brother?

110
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:53,055
Yeah, his name is Jesse Garon.
You know, Elvis' middle name is Aaron.

111
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:57,195
Aaron, Garon. Anyway,
everybody thinks that he died at birth.

112
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,955
But my theory is...

113
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:02,568
that his mother didn't wanna raise two kids.
She wasn't expecting twins.

114
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:05,067
She couldn't afford to raise both.
She gave one away.

115
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:09,698
She just sent one off. So Jesse grew up
in Arkansas, or Mississippi, or something.

116
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:13,573
So he didn't know he had a brother, Elvis.
But one day, like, 1968 or '69...

117
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:17,238
he's looking at himself in the mirror
and says, "Damn, I look like Elvis".

118
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:19,977
So he comes to Memphis, looks up Elvis.

119
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:23,589
Elvis sees him, he says,
"Yeah, you're my brother. I can't believe it!"

120
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:26,281
"How you doing? What can I do for you?"

121
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,121
And his brother says, "Well, I don't know".

122
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,162
"Sure would be nice
to be you for one night."

123
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:35,964
So Elvis had this concert
where his brother sang.

124
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:40,937
They tried to see if they could trick people.
Damn if he didn't sound like his brother!

125
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:42,937
Then Elvis had an idea.

126
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:46,010
I'm tired of the music scene.
I'll send him out on tour.

127
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:49,808
Big mistake, because it was his brother
who started to go to Vegas...

128
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,612
and wear them big collars,
the white jumpsuits, and the capes.

129
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:57,278
Elvis wouldn't do that.
And it was his brother who got really fat.

130
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,290
You know, eating those
banana-fried butter sandwiches and all.

131
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:05,090
The Colonel said, "We gotta get rid
of this guy. He can't be Elvis anymore."

132
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:08,792
So they started feeding him pills.
I think they killed him.

133
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:13,968
So what? What are you saying?
What's the punch line?

134
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,136
- Y'all are Elvis fans?
- No.

135
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,618
You wanna hear something about Elvis?
I'll tell you something about him.

136
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:28,652
- You ever heard of Otis Blackwell?
- No, ma'am.

137
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,722
- You ever heard of Junior Parker?
- No, ma'am.

138
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:35,620
Yeah, I didn't think so.
You know, Elvis robbed their music, man.

139
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:40,129
He paid them $10 for their music,
and all these other black musicians, too.

140
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,133
- That's what I think of Elvis.
- Here's where my theory fits.

141
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:46,204
I don't think it was Elvis.
I think it was his brother.

142
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,533
So in that case, it's all right?

143
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:54,878
My favorite Elvis quote is, "The only thing
colors can do for me is shine my shoes".

144
00:11:56,382 --> 00:12:00,546
I don't think the King said that.
See, I think it was his evil twin.

145
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:05,750
Danny, what you doing over there?
You got tables to wait on. Come on.

146
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,723
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah, don't get fired, man.

147
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,859
Slaphappy hillbilly.

148
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:13,925
Cheers.

149
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,667
Something smells funny in here.

150
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:27,237
Is that my shirt you got on?

151
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:31,210
No, I don't think so.

152
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:33,784
Yeah, I think it is.
This doesn't smell like me.

153
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,181
Yeah? What do you smell like?

154
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,414
I smell like me,
and this doesn't smell like me.

155
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,388
- I smell like me, too.
- But this smells like you.

156
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,390
That's because I am me.

157
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:44,796
Is that my shirt?

158
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,524
- Why you always copying me, anyway?
- I'm not copying you.

159
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,134
- Why don't you get your own style?
- I have my own style.

160
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:53,898
No, you're always copying me.
Your style is my style because you copy it.

161
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:56,132
- It's my style.
- No, it's not your style.

162
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:59,039
Service is bad, the coffee is bad,
the music sucks.

163
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:00,304
Those are my shoes.

164
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,209
- These are my shoes.
- Those are my shoes.

165
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:04,373
- These are my shoes.
- Those are my other shoes.

166
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,448
Bullshit.

167
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,030
- Hey.
- Hey, Tom.

168
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,965
- All right.
- I'm glad you could make it.

169
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,430
You are here.

170
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,610
You know, you can call me Jim.

171
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:09,805
I mean, you know, my friends call me Jim,
or Jimmy, or Iggy, or Jiggy.

172
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:11,706
Call me Iggy.

173
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:17,449
Okay, all right, whichever way you go.
I'll go either way, Jim or Iggy...

174
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,648
You call me Iggy.

175
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,528
Look, I'm sorry I'm late, Jim.
Boy, four-car pileup.

176
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,793
I delivered a baby this morning
at about 9:00.

177
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:32,699
I was saving lives,
I was out there on the highway, it was...

178
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,868
You know, there's nothing worse
than roadside surgery.

179
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:39,705
You don't have your own tools,
and it's just... It's murder.

180
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:43,849
I performed a tracheotomy
with a ballpoint pen and...

181
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,475
I've been busy.

182
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,850
Wait a minute. You're a doctor?

183
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:55,721
Yeah, I'm a doctor.

184
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,922
Music and medicine, really.
It's really been my thing.

185
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,560
It's combining the two
and living in that place where they overlap.

186
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:10,839
A lot of people say it shows up in the music.
I don't know. I mean, it's...

187
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,104
Well, okay. Yeah, I can see that.

188
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:19,711
Yeah, okay. I think the organization
and the whole thing...

189
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:21,114
- The humanity, I guess.
- Yeah.

190
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:25,951
- The humanity of the thing. The regard.
- Yeah, the regard.

191
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:30,924
- I guess it's a big day for you, then.
- It is. It was a medical morning.

192
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,725
- Everybody's all right?
- Everybody's fine.

193
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,967
You've been here a while, I see.

194
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,901
I've been here. Drinking a little coffee.

195
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,405
- Yeah, I see.
- I ordered you some.

196
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,606
You ordered for me?

197
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,113
I mean, is it cool? Is that cool?

198
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:54,311
Yeah, okay. Coffee, yeah.

199
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,253
- I could go for a coffee.
- Okay, man.

200
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,649
Come on, have some coffee.

201
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,824
Okay, coffee it is.

202
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,351
Are those your cigarettes?

203
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,580
No, they were just sitting here
when I got here.

204
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,985
- You don't smoke, do you?
- No. I gave it up.

205
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,957
- Not for me, either.
- Boy, enough of that.

206
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,255
That was enough, 25 big ones.

207
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,130
- Finished.
- Got the energy now.

208
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:47,536
Since I quit, I mean, just everything...

209
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:49,801
Yeah, you're focused.

210
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:52,706
- Zeroed in. Bang, you know?
- Me, too.

211
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:57,783
I feel sorry for suckers still puffing away,
you know?

212
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,846
- No willpower.
- No willpower. Pacifier.

213
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:02,879
Silly.

214
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:09,320
You know, the beauty of quitting is,
now that I've quit...

215
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,860
I can have one. Because I've quit.

216
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,996
I mean, it's just like jewelry.

217
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:22,698
You know, it's not really...
I don't even inhale.

218
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:27,245
You want to join me in one?

219
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,406
Yeah, since I quit. Okay.

220
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,245
- Now that you've quit, you can have one.
- Sure, yeah.

221
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,387
I can do that. All right.

222
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,724
Boy, thank you.

223
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:49,766
Yeah, you know what I mean?
Now that we've quit...

224
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:59,037
Cigarettes and coffee, man.
That's a combination.

225
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,713
Can't beat it.

226
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:08,954
We're really the coffee-and-cigarettes
generation, when you think about it.

227
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:14,519
You know what I mean? In the '40s,
it was the pie-and-coffee generation.

228
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:19,392
Like Abbott and Costello on TV, man.
They always wanted pie and coffee.

229
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:24,134
Yeah, like Abbott and Costello.
They were always ordering pie and coffee.

230
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,396
Have some coffee.
Have some pie and coffee.

231
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,699
What are you waiting for?

232
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,780
You hang out here a lot?

233
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,281
This is my hangout.

234
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:47,487
I just wondered, 'cause I didn't see
anything of yours on the jukebox.

235
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:57,592
If you don't like it here, we could
go down to Taco Bell or something.

236
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,964
Maybe that's more your style.

237
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:06,104
What are you saying, man?
You're saying I'm a Taco Bell kind of guy?

238
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,615
No. I mean, if you don't like it here.

239
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,145
- You said you don't like it here.
- No, I didn't say that.

240
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,514
We could go to
the International House of Pancakes.

241
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:17,656
Maybe that's more up your alley.
I don't know.

242
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:21,759
I didn't say that. I don't wanna go
to the International House of Pancakes.

243
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,451
I'm comfortable.

244
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:34,863
Coffee is good, though, at IHOP.

245
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,669
You like the coffee down there at IHOP?

246
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:45,982
I drink the coffee at IHOP.
I like the coffee. You don't like it?

247
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:49,610
Yeah, man. I like the IHOP coffee.

248
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,048
- Classy brew.
- Yeah, that's good coffee.

249
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:58,489
Yeah, that's good coffee at the IHOP.

250
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:08,539
I almost forgot. Listen.

251
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:12,002
I worked with this drummer
the other day in LA.

252
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,374
And this guy, man, his name is Giant Robo.

253
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:20,348
He was clanging and banging really hard.
Man, I thought of you.

254
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:21,577
Maybe you want to...

255
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:25,053
This is somebody,
I think you ought to check him out.

256
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:29,822
You mean,
you think I need a professional drummer?

257
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:31,857
I'm not good enough?

258
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:34,698
What are you talking about?

259
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:38,234
No, but I'm just...
You know, it's a musician.

260
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:42,431
I thought... I just wanted to tell you
about this guy. It'd be great, man.

261
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:47,272
It's hard and industrial, and he's beating,
and I just thought, "wow".

262
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,879
What are you trying to tell me?
I need a drummer?

263
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,552
I could use a drummer?

264
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:02,082
The drumming on my records sucks?
What are you saying?

265
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,025
Forget it, man.

266
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:43,301
You know what?

267
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:46,829
- I think I really got to get going.
- You got to go?

268
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:49,133
Maybe another cup?
Maybe another cigarette?

269
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,900
Boy, I'd like to.

270
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:55,311
No. I really gotta go. I mean...

271
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,483
My wife, she's alone in a motel.

272
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,146
Maybe we could call her up,
come on down here.

273
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,350
Have a cup of coffee
and a couple of cigarettes.

274
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:12,864
She doesn't smoke.
You know, it's the willpower.

275
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:14,829
- I see.
- I don't want to start her.

276
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,298
No, you don't want to get her started.

277
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,537
- This is our little thing here.
- Yeah, right.

278
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,638
But we can just sort of...

279
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:26,977
We can just keep zipping along, you know.

280
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:29,011
I'll be thinking of you.

281
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:32,648
- Gotta go.
- I guess so.

282
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,818
- See you soon.
- Yeah, okay.

283
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:40,818
I wish you could stay a little longer.

284
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:46,220
- We were just starting to get going here.
- Gotta go.

285
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:51,898
Okay, Jim.

286
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:54,331
- Next time.
- Okay, next time.

287
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:57,141
- You take care.
- You take care, too.

288
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:23,935
He's not on here, either.

289
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,390
- You're a fucking moron, you know that?
- Now what?

290
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:31,330
I can't believe that
you're still smoking those fucking things.

291
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:33,562
Vinny, they'll fuck you up.

292
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,967
They'll kill you. Believe me.

293
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:39,340
Were you put on this fucking earth
to annoy me?

294
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:41,308
You said you were gonna quit.

295
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,914
Instead, you spend a fortune...

296
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:47,246
so those big tobacco companies
can get fucking rich.

297
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:48,943
And then you get cancer.

298
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:53,080
And then the fucking doctors
and the hospitals, they can get rich.

299
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:55,089
And the undertakers, too.

300
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,455
All because you want to smoke
like a fucking moron.

301
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:00,530
I can't help it. I'm fucking addicted, okay?

302
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:02,833
So, coffee and cigarettes?

303
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:06,600
That's your lunch? That ain't healthy, is it?

304
00:25:06,609 --> 00:25:09,408
You're drinking coffee
so don't break my fuckin' balls.

305
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,999
Vinny, I had lunch already.

306
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:15,378
So I'm on a diet, okay? Jesus!

307
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:22,278
Here comes my freaking kid.

308
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,730
Do me a favor.
Don't tell your mother, please.

309
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:37,892
What the fuck am I talking about?
She smokes like a locomotive, anyway.

310
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,401
How you doing, Junior?

311
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,805
- He don't talk much, does he?
- Not lately.

312
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,576
Lately he's been the silent type.

313
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:52,350
I gave you $10 last night.
So what did you do with it?

314
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:02,822
I just gave you $5.

315
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,595
Listen, I'll give you $1 more. That's it.

316
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:14,395
Can I at least get a hug?
For $6, can I get a freaking hug?

317
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:16,541
$10 for a hug?

318
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:20,872
You gotta be out of your freaking mind.
All right, come here. I'll give you.

319
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:26,042
You better go get yourself something to eat,
and something good.

320
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:29,779
Yeah, just like him.
Get some coffee and cigarettes.

321
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:32,550
Oh, brother!
What the fuck are you talking about?

322
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,385
Look how much coffee you're drinking.

323
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,687
You got the whole fucking pot
over there with you.

324
00:26:36,862 --> 00:26:39,558
So what? They always bring me a whole pot.

325
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:42,130
I like coffee. Keeps me going.

326
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:46,530
It keeps you going, all right.
You're a fucking maniac. A caffeine maniac.

327
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:48,570
- You're drinking coffee, ain't you?
- Yeah.

328
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,231
- So?
- So maybe you should try to quit.

329
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,744
- I ain't no fucking quitter.
- I'll drink to that.

330
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:07,157
Fucking moron.

331
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,954
Shit, here comes my kid again.

332
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,897
How much did you spend?

333
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:19,264
And that's all you got for $4?

334
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,573
Peas and something to drink for $4?

335
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:26,333
- What the heck is in that bag?
- It's those Chinese peas.

336
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:28,977
They're not?

337
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:31,305
They're Japanese?

338
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,644
Chinese, Japanese. Same thing.

339
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:38,449
Try one.

340
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:52,095
Jesus Christ! Tastes like black pepper.

341
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,804
Give me those.

342
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:59,003
Little bastard. Did you see that?
He tried to fucking poison me.

343
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:03,205
No, he didn't, Joe. Listen to me.
Those things are very expensive.

344
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:06,146
They're like a delicacy. A refined taste.

345
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:08,282
Refined taste, my ass.

346
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,659
Jesus Christ, not again.

347
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,987
I can't even light a fucking cigarette
around here without getting busted.

348
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:21,826
You know something?
You really are a fucking moron.

349
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,002
I'm gonna get to those
big tobacco companies...

350
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:28,037
and I'm gonna thank them
when they put you in the fucking ground.

351
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:32,473
And did I ever tell that you're like
a fucking wife that I don't need?

352
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:37,144
Can't fucking enjoy a cigarette.

353
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:54,081
Excuse me, miss.
Can I get you some more coffee?

354
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,987
I really wish you hadn't done that.

355
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:03,225
I had it the right color,
the right temperature. It was just right.

356
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:07,997
Sorry.

357
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:55,353
Hi.

358
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:02,485
Sorry. Sorry about the coffee.

359
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:55,201
- Does your name happen to be Gloria?
- No.

360
00:31:56,448 --> 00:32:00,885
'Cause I thought maybe you...
You're not friends with...

361
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:05,715
Sorry.

362
00:32:40,926 --> 00:32:43,224
So can I get you something else?

363
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,893
A sandwich? Something to eat
along with your coffee?

364
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:52,099
It's not a very healthy lunch,
just the coffee and cigarettes.

365
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,238
It's not my lunch, okay?

366
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:03,573
Sorry.

367
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:05,093
Alex.

368
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:07,896
You startled me.

369
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,237
How are you, Isaach?

370
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,035
Okay?

371
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:18,143
Very well.

372
00:35:19,384 --> 00:35:21,113
I'm happy to see you.

373
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:24,584
I was so sick of being in Paris.
You can't imagine.

374
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:28,653
Sit down.

375
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,830
So, I was happy to get your call.

376
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:41,431
So long time we didn't see each other.

377
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:47,802
- I ordered you some coffee, okay?
- Yeah, sure. Thanks.

378
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:51,779
So, everything is okay?

379
00:35:53,952 --> 00:35:56,819
Everything is okay. Very good.

380
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,487
I am fine.

381
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,233
So, are you sure that
everything is okay with you?

382
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,371
Everything is okay.

383
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,808
And you?

384
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:59,742
Me? Things are okay.

385
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:03,344
Not perfect, you know,
but pretty much okay.

386
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:07,357
Good. I'm very happy to see you.

387
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,651
I'm happy to see you, man.

388
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,276
It's just that
since I didn't see you for so long...

389
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:35,579
and you called to say you wanted to see me,
I thought maybe something was wrong.

390
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:39,850
No. I just wanted to see you, that's all.

391
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:43,952
Me too, man. I wanted to see you too.

392
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,868
Are you sure there's nothing
you want to tell me?

393
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,568
- Nothing bothering you?
- But why?

394
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:07,214
- Do you want something to be wrong?
- Not at all.

395
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:12,078
When I got your call, I had an intuition
that something was bothering you.

396
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:15,715
Something maybe you need to talk about.
That's all, man.

397
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,092
Isaach, there is nothing wrong.

398
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:21,391
Really.

399
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:24,959
Okay?

400
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:31,840
Are you sure?

401
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:35,242
Are you crazy, Isaach?

402
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:45,018
Are you sure you have nothing...

403
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,822
you know, to let out?

404
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:54,458
Should I invent something bad?

405
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,698
I could invent something bad for you.

406
00:38:56,868 --> 00:39:00,929
Not at all.
No. I don't want you to invent something.

407
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,497
You know, I'm your best friend.

408
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:06,473
You should feel completely free
to tell me the truth.

409
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:09,476
To tell me whatever is bothering you.

410
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:12,006
Cut the shit.

411
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,715
Okay, I understand. That's cool.

412
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:24,158
Thank you.

413
00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:27,295
No problem.

414
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:30,056
Isaach, no problem.

415
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:57,189
I guess I'm gonna go.

416
00:39:57,762 --> 00:40:00,196
Really? So soon?

417
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,362
Yeah, you know, man...

418
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:07,834
if you don't want to talk to me about it,
I don't want to be a problem.

419
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:13,938
There is no problem, Isaach.
Don't you understand? No problem.

420
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,673
I understand. But listen...

421
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:22,383
if you don't want to talk now,
call me anytime, okay?

422
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:27,255
Now maybe it's not the right time for you,
that's all.

423
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,404
So, I was very happy to see you.

424
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:51,112
Yes, me too.

425
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:56,550
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but there is nothing wrong. Really.

426
00:40:58,623 --> 00:40:59,954
It's okay.

427
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:02,991
I do understand.

428
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:05,925
No. You don't understand.

429
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:10,093
Call me.

430
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:12,292
See you, Isaach.

431
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,131
Soon.

432
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:34,340
- Hi, so nice to see you.
- You too.

433
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,076
It's been ages.

434
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:42,192
Last time, what?
A couple of years ago in Sydney, wasn't it?

435
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,520
Really, was that two years ago?

436
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,095
How are Jeff and Beryl?

437
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:53,167
You know, same old, same old.
Still stuck in their odd little parental ways.

438
00:42:55,373 --> 00:42:58,740
So you're not with Mr. Cate and the baby
on this trip?

439
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:03,741
No. Unfortunately, I'm by myself.
I'll see them next week.

440
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:09,442
Everyone's good?

441
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:14,091
Yeah, I want a baby.

442
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:16,959
At some point.

443
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,724
- What can I get for you?
- What are you having, Catie?

444
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,461
Can I have an espresso, please?
In a large cup?

445
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:31,639
Yeah, I'll have an espresso too, thanks.
A double.

446
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:34,744
And can I have some hot milk on the side?
And could you heat it?

447
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:37,574
- I think we can manage that.
- Thank you.

448
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:46,080
I'm sorry I'm late.
I know you haven't got a lot of time.

449
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,791
Don't worry about it.
I just wish I could stay here longer.

450
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:55,430
Do you stay here overnight,
or do you just do your press stuff here?

451
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,931
Your junket.

452
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:02,597
No, I stay overnight
and I do the interviews here too.

453
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:04,297
I just think it's easier.

454
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,670
They do the interviews in my suite upstairs.

455
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:09,244
They're setting up for the next interview...

456
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:13,611
and I just thought maybe it would be nicer
if we met down here.

457
00:44:16,287 --> 00:44:19,017
No, thanks, Shell. You're not...

458
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:22,585
Go on.

459
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:25,789
They're not going to stop you smoking.

460
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:33,196
- There you go, cous'.
- Thanks.

461
00:44:38,376 --> 00:44:41,174
So you mean they give you
this full-on hotel suite...

462
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:44,007
and they also use it for your publicity?

463
00:44:46,217 --> 00:44:48,208
Seems kind of cheap.

464
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:53,122
Well, it's a suite.
So they just divide up the room.

465
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:55,156
Yeah, but why couldn't
they get you a suite...

466
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,123
and get another suite to do your press in?

467
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,327
It's pretty low-budget, this thing I did.

468
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:03,198
Yeah, still.

469
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:06,529
It's pretty cheap, man.

470
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:11,331
Can I get you anything else?

471
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,908
- No, thanks. That's great.
- You're welcome.

472
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:23,179
Kind of weird getting in here.
I almost didn't...

473
00:45:25,256 --> 00:45:27,918
until they found out I was your cousin.

474
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,257
There're some photographer,
paparazzi guys hanging out front.

475
00:45:34,265 --> 00:45:37,200
I guess they kind of
follow you around, right?

476
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:41,736
You know, whatever so-called celebrities
are around, I suppose.

477
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:46,373
God, that must be
a real fucking drag sometimes, right?

478
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,175
I mean, not like me.

479
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:52,208
I'm free.

480
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,877
Practically broke, but I'm completely free.

481
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:58,021
No one's stalking me,
that's for fucking sure.

482
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,615
Except when they thought I was you.

483
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:06,424
I got into this club once
because they thought I was you.

484
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:11,060
Then they found out I wasn't
and asked me to leave.

485
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:12,930
Pretty fucking rude.

486
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:18,367
Don't get me wrong.
I mean, it must be fabulous. You got it all.

487
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:20,635
You got a good husband, beautiful baby.

488
00:46:20,878 --> 00:46:23,870
Travel all over the world,
stay in fancy hotels.

489
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:26,480
Parties...

490
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:30,652
You know what they say,
the grass is always greener.

491
00:46:31,222 --> 00:46:32,814
So, how's...

492
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:36,085
Shit.

493
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:37,616
- Johnny.
- Who?

494
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,763
Jimmy. Tommy. Sorry.

495
00:46:41,232 --> 00:46:42,494
How is he?

496
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,835
We broke up almost two years ago.

497
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,767
Tommy, yeah. What a dickhead.

498
00:46:53,511 --> 00:46:56,241
Got a new boyfriend now. Lee. Remember?

499
00:46:57,415 --> 00:46:59,849
He's in a band. Wrote you about him.

500
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:02,742
He's a pretty huge part of my life.

501
00:47:03,621 --> 00:47:05,851
Sorry, Shell, I don't think you did.

502
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:08,491
Yeah, I even sent you his fucking CD.

503
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:12,528
Your assistant
probably didn't give it to you.

504
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:18,128
It's okay. It's totally cool.
I mean, I know how busy your life is.

505
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:22,036
- Do you remember where you sent it?
- No.

506
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:25,475
I mean, one week you're in LA...

507
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,644
then you're in London,
then you're in Sydney.

508
00:47:27,812 --> 00:47:31,680
I mean, you're in a different fucking city
every day of the week.

509
00:47:44,562 --> 00:47:48,328
I'd love to hear the music.
What does it sound like?

510
00:47:50,134 --> 00:47:51,567
It's really...

511
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:54,827
kind of hard...

512
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:58,171
and it's industrial, kind of throbbing...

513
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:03,905
I don't think you'd get it.

514
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:10,047
- What are they called?
- They're called Sqürl.

515
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,082
Squirrel.

516
00:48:12,323 --> 00:48:15,019
No, Sqürl. You know, like they say it here.

517
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:18,252
S-Q-U-R-L, with an umlaut
over the "U". Sqürl.

518
00:48:19,764 --> 00:48:23,200
Sqürl. I get it. Right.

519
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,161
So can I buy the CD
until I find the one you sent?

520
00:48:26,337 --> 00:48:31,036
No, not yet. They recorded it independently,
you know, so...

521
00:48:31,542 --> 00:48:34,875
But I think the record company's
gonna put it out finally.

522
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:36,205
I think.

523
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:44,551
I'm gonna have to find that CD
so I can listen to it.

524
00:48:45,623 --> 00:48:47,591
You're not gonna find it.

525
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,420
Shell, that isn't fair, actually.

526
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:53,962
- It's true. You're not gonna find it.
- Really?

527
00:48:55,866 --> 00:48:59,893
I fucking know you're not.
'Cause I just remembered...

528
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:03,267
I didn't actually send it to you.

529
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:06,467
I think I just thought
about sending it to you.

530
00:49:22,927 --> 00:49:25,987
Almost forgot. This is for you.

531
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:29,224
Thanks. What is it?

532
00:49:32,403 --> 00:49:35,930
This is really expensive stuff.
It must have cost hundreds.

533
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:43,144
Cool, thanks. I could use this stuff.

534
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:47,173
Make me look like a movie star, right?

535
00:49:50,788 --> 00:49:52,779
- Cheers.
- Cheers, gorgeous.

536
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:02,259
Seriously, Catie, thanks for seeing me.

537
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:06,192
No, thanks for seeing me.

538
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:11,470
And thanks for all the fancy swag.

539
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:14,643
It's nothing.

540
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,777
It is swag, isn't it?

541
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:23,378
They probably give you
all kinds of free stuff...

542
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:25,048
jewelry, clothes.

543
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:27,984
Probably give you cars, right?

544
00:50:28,292 --> 00:50:30,954
No, they don't give me cars.

545
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,896
They sometimes give me makeup,
from time to time.

546
00:50:34,899 --> 00:50:36,958
But I just thought...

547
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:39,466
I don't know, I just wanted...

548
00:50:39,637 --> 00:50:41,867
Didn't have time to go shopping.

549
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:45,664
No, really, it's fine.
I mean, it's great. I can use it.

550
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,572
It's just funny, don't you think?

551
00:50:48,746 --> 00:50:53,376
When you can't afford something,
it's really expensive.

552
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:56,251
And then when you can afford it, it's free.

553
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:00,990
Kind of backward, don't you think?

554
00:51:03,327 --> 00:51:06,694
The world's a bit like that, I guess,
in a lot of ways.

555
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:10,097
Speaking of paparazzi...

556
00:51:10,334 --> 00:51:13,201
I saw these photos of you the other day
in the tabloids.

557
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:15,565
Don't tell me that. Yuck.

558
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,401
What was I wearing?

559
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:20,033
Sorry.

560
00:51:22,046 --> 00:51:24,776
Hello? Hi, Lindsey.

561
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:31,080
I'm downstairs, in the coffee room
with my cousin Shelly.

562
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:33,746
It's already...

563
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:39,119
Okay, yeah. I'll be up in a minute. Bye.

564
00:51:39,296 --> 00:51:40,888
- Got to get back to work?
- Yeah.

565
00:51:41,065 --> 00:51:42,623
Back to the grind?

566
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:46,863
Do you want to come up to the room?

567
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:50,135
It won't be very interesting,
but you're welcome to come up.

568
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:53,200
What, and watch you do TV interviews
and stuff?

569
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,469
Like Entertainment Tonight?

570
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:09,055
Maybe you can send me that CD,
or a letter, or something.

571
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:13,754
- Yeah, but you wouldn't read it.
- Stop it. I would if you actually sent it.

572
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:19,765
I've really gotta go. Sorry.

573
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:23,934
It was great seeing you.
Have you got my numbers?

574
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:31,941
Take care. Send my love to everyone.

575
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:38,185
Yeah, send my love to everyone
on your end.

576
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,927
If they even remember me.

577
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:47,120
- Bye, Catie.
- See you, Shell.

578
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:51,324
Put that on my room
and anything else she wants.

579
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:54,369
- Maybe next time I'll get to meet Lou.
- Yeah.

580
00:52:55,806 --> 00:52:57,000
It's Lee.

581
00:53:05,449 --> 00:53:06,780
Excuse me.

582
00:53:08,986 --> 00:53:11,887
Can I have a tequila?
Thanks, a double, and the menu.

583
00:53:12,056 --> 00:53:14,991
I'm sorry, there's no smoking in the lounge.

584
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:09,234
So, Jack, you going to tell me
about your tesla coil?

585
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,438
You said you didn't want to hear about it.

586
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:15,271
Yeah, but that was a while ago.

587
00:55:16,847 --> 00:55:19,509
I don't know if I want to talk about it.

588
00:55:22,286 --> 00:55:23,617
Come on, Jack.

589
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:26,779
You dragged it all the way down here
in your little red wagon.

590
00:55:26,957 --> 00:55:29,118
Come on, just tell me about it.

591
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:37,456
I built it based on the inventor
Nikola Tesla's original designs.

592
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:40,603
It's an air transformer...

593
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:44,501
with primary and secondary coils
that are tuned to resonate.

594
00:55:45,209 --> 00:55:48,007
It's basically a step-up transformer...

595
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:52,478
which converts relatively low-voltage
high current to high-voltage low current...

596
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:54,344
at high frequencies.

597
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:57,653
Do you remember...

598
00:55:57,855 --> 00:56:01,689
when we were kids,
you had a little Barbie makeup mirror?

599
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:04,157
Yeah, I remember that.

600
00:56:04,628 --> 00:56:07,153
It had a little fluorescent light on it?

601
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:10,793
Nikola Tesla invented fluorescent light.

602
00:56:11,635 --> 00:56:14,365
Without him,
we wouldn't have alternating current...

603
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:18,167
radio, television, x-ray technology...

604
00:56:19,176 --> 00:56:22,839
induction motors, particle beams, lasers.

605
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:26,243
None of that would even exist,
if it weren't for him.

606
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:28,348
Or the rock band, Tesla.

607
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:32,680
Funny.

608
00:56:35,092 --> 00:56:37,026
Tesla was a true genius.

609
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:42,224
If we had paid more attention to his ideas,
the world would be a much better place.

610
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:45,527
We'd have free mass communication,
free transportation...

611
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:47,260
free energy for everyone.

612
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:51,100
That's why they discredited him in the end.
For free energy.

613
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:57,043
He perceived the Earth
as a conductor of acoustical resonance.

614
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:03,251
What a beautiful idea.

615
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:10,590
So, Jack, are you going to show me
how the coil works?

616
00:57:11,962 --> 00:57:13,554
Yeah, all right.

617
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:18,394
You'll need these.

618
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:49,098
- All right, you ready, Meg?
- I'm ready.

619
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,457
Damn it. Something went wrong.

620
00:58:23,934 --> 00:58:25,629
It was cool, though.

621
00:58:26,636 --> 00:58:29,969
Yeah, but it wasn't supposed to stop.
It was supposed to keep working.

622
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:32,005
I don't know what happened.

623
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:34,609
I think maybe you blew a capacitor?

624
00:58:34,978 --> 00:58:37,378
No, I didn't blow a capacitor, Meg.

625
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:42,315
Maybe it tripped your GFI.

626
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:45,318
Yeah, your Ground Fault Interrupter.

627
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:48,821
Yeah, I know what a GFI is.
That's not what happened.

628
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:51,958
You don't have to snap at me.

629
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:12,174
I think maybe the spark gaps
are too far apart on your spark coil vibrator.

630
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,389
Yeah, that could be it.

631
00:59:24,995 --> 00:59:26,155
I guess.

632
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,865
Yeah, it is. That's it.

633
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:36,202
You're right about that.
I didn't check that earlier.

634
00:59:49,352 --> 00:59:51,843
I'm gonna go home and check it out.

635
00:59:53,723 --> 00:59:56,419
- Are you going to go bowling tomorrow?
- Yeah, I'll be there.

636
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:58,719
All right, I'll see you there.

637
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:49,343
Earth as a conductor
of acoustical resonance.

638
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:14,467
Hello, who is this?

639
01:01:15,038 --> 01:01:18,303
Laura. Hi, this is Alfred Molina
for Steve Coogan.

640
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:25,038
M-O-L-I-N-A.

641
01:01:27,384 --> 01:01:28,942
The actor, yes.

642
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:33,482
I was just double-checking that Steve...

643
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:35,985
He is. Great, okay.

644
01:01:36,293 --> 01:01:38,818
Just in case you need it,
my cell phone number...

645
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:40,121
Hello?

646
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:52,964
- Hello, Alfred.
- Steve, hello.

647
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:57,244
Hi. I'm so glad you could make it.
Please sit down.

648
01:01:57,914 --> 01:02:02,214
I was just talking to Laura, your assistant,
seeing if you were on your way here.

649
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,852
- I'm here.
- Fantastic.

650
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:06,648
I took the liberty of ordering some tea.

651
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:08,857
Shall I be mother?

652
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:11,883
That's okay, I'll be my own mother.

653
01:02:12,329 --> 01:02:14,194
Some milk there for you.

654
01:02:15,532 --> 01:02:16,692
Real tea.

655
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:19,595
It's hard to come by.

656
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:24,365
I have this fantasy where if I ever won
a Golden Globe or an Academy Award...

657
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:29,001
I'd use the opportunity to tell the Yanks
how to make a decent cup of tea.

658
01:02:30,447 --> 01:02:33,007
- Here's to a good cup of tea.
- Cheers.

659
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:40,389
I love your coat.

660
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:43,192
Yeah, it's Viv Westwood.

661
01:02:46,062 --> 01:02:48,690
I've got a weakness for British designers.

662
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:51,026
I don't know what it is
about American designers.

663
01:02:51,201 --> 01:02:53,431
They're just too safe.

664
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:58,730
Aren't you going to be a little bit warm?
It's about 85 outside.

665
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:02,244
No, I take it off when I go out.

666
01:03:03,046 --> 01:03:05,412
It's just the air conditioning.

667
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:17,252
- So how long have you been living in LA?
- We've been here about seven years.

668
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,386
We love it here.

669
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:22,826
I do love visiting LA.

670
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:27,595
But I always say, it's a great place to visit,
it's an even nicer place to leave.

671
01:03:29,773 --> 01:03:31,104
The palm trees...

672
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,999
Palm trees annoy the fuck out of me.

673
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,746
It's not for everybody. I like it here.

674
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:40,974
I came out here for the work and stuff.

675
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:46,949
It's great to finally meet you.

676
01:03:47,257 --> 01:03:50,192
I've got to say I'm a huge fan of your stuff...

677
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,624
all the stuff you've done on TV,
the comedy stuff.

678
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:57,630
I've got all the tapes.
I get them sent over. It's fantastic.

679
01:03:58,335 --> 01:03:59,632
Thank you.

680
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:10,001
Likewise, I'm certainly very aware of you.

681
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:11,541
Great.

682
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:16,812
I saw that TV series you did.

683
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:19,612
Yeah, you saw that?

684
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:21,981
Yeah. Interesting.

685
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:26,151
- We got canceled.
- Yeah, I heard that.

686
01:04:27,664 --> 01:04:29,962
Comedy's such a difficult thing.

687
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:40,673
Your career seems to be going terribly well.
You've got a lot of heat at the moment.

688
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,041
Is that why you're here?

689
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:49,514
The merry-go-round of meetings. It's nice.

690
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:54,179
People are finally starting
to take a bit of notice, which is great.

691
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:57,019
- Are you meeting on anything interesting?
- Yeah.

692
01:05:06,169 --> 01:05:10,868
I've got to say you were just fantastic...

693
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:15,943
in 24 Hour. No, seriously,
24 Hour Party People was just a knockout.

694
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:18,846
- I mean, brilliant. Great work.
- Thank you.

695
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,607
Really brilliant. It was...

696
01:05:23,186 --> 01:05:24,778
And the reviews...

697
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:27,552
They were pretty fucking great.

698
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,385
I was amazed because it was...

699
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:34,052
I didn't think many people would get
all the cultural references.

700
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:37,131
Sort of, Manchester, early '80s,
the whole music scene.

701
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:38,426
You'd be surprised.

702
01:05:38,635 --> 01:05:42,799
But a lot of people didn't have any kind
of reference to make to it because...

703
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:45,400
They know about the bands over here...

704
01:05:45,575 --> 01:05:49,739
but the whole thing, your character,
and his running the TV show...

705
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:51,743
Do you want a cigarette?

706
01:05:51,915 --> 01:05:54,748
- Sorry, they're French.
- No, that's okay. Thanks.

707
01:06:01,391 --> 01:06:03,256
I'll save it for later.

708
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:06,285
Okay.

709
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:19,438
So, Laura said that...

710
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:25,570
you were really keen to meeting.
She wouldn't tell me what it was.

711
01:06:25,748 --> 01:06:29,275
I didn't want to say it over the phone
because it would've sounded weird.

712
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:32,512
I can imagine how she thought.
This was coming out of nowhere.

713
01:06:32,522 --> 01:06:34,683
I phone her up,
and she doesn't know me from Adam.

714
01:06:34,858 --> 01:06:37,622
I said, "I must talk to Steve Coogan".

715
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,522
But I wanted to see you in person.

716
01:06:39,696 --> 01:06:41,857
When I found out you'd be here
for a few days...

717
01:06:42,098 --> 01:06:44,794
I thought this was the perfect opportunity
to let you know...

718
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:47,697
Anyway, I'll get right to it.

719
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,931
I'm so excited about this.

720
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,934
Let me try and put it in context.

721
01:06:56,346 --> 01:06:59,008
I've always had a big passion for history...

722
01:06:59,182 --> 01:07:01,173
and people's lives...

723
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:06,152
and all the little events
of how you get from A to B...

724
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:09,684
and all the small details in people's lives...

725
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:13,192
that are kind of really full of epic qualities.

726
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:16,699
So I've been doing all this research and...

727
01:07:19,903 --> 01:07:21,370
I've come up with this.

728
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:25,030
And what state is...
Is it greenlit or is it just a treatment?

729
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:26,732
What stage is it?

730
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:30,537
I'm sorry. God, it's so embarrassing.

731
01:07:30,747 --> 01:07:34,478
It's not some... This isn't work.
It's got nothing to do with work.

732
01:07:34,651 --> 01:07:36,414
It's not a project.

733
01:07:36,586 --> 01:07:40,545
I did some genealogical research,
and I came across...

734
01:07:41,024 --> 01:07:42,321
What I discovered was...

735
01:07:42,492 --> 01:07:44,187
- Mr. Coogan?
- Yes?

736
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,055
- It is you, isn't it?
- It is, yes.

737
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:49,259
- I'm such a huge fan.
- You're not that huge.

738
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,429
Only where it counts.

739
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:56,531
- Could I bother you for an autograph?
- Absolutely.

740
01:07:56,773 --> 01:07:59,003
- Great.
- I've been recognized.

741
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:01,104
Where do you want it?

742
01:08:01,678 --> 01:08:05,170
- Paper is fine.
- Spoilsport.

743
01:08:06,716 --> 01:08:08,707
- No, don't do that.
- Sorry.

744
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:11,887
- I probably have something in my bag.
- Okay.

745
01:08:12,355 --> 01:08:14,380
Just give me a second here.

746
01:08:15,725 --> 01:08:16,885
Oh, gosh.

747
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:19,384
- I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.

748
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:23,357
- Give me one more minute.
- Take your time.

749
01:08:23,533 --> 01:08:27,526
- Here, please, in there.
- Okay, and what's your name?

750
01:08:27,737 --> 01:08:28,795
Katy.

751
01:08:29,706 --> 01:08:31,731
- With a "Y".
- All right.

752
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:33,800
What Katy did next.

753
01:08:34,811 --> 01:08:37,541
- Hello.
- Alfred's an actor too.

754
01:08:40,383 --> 01:08:42,578
- Here.
- Thank you. Great.

755
01:08:44,587 --> 01:08:47,147
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

756
01:08:53,329 --> 01:08:55,763
- Wow.
- Let's get back to this.

757
01:08:55,932 --> 01:08:58,924
I don't want to take up too much
of your time. I know you're busy.

758
01:08:59,102 --> 01:09:02,003
As I said, I did this genealogical research...

759
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:06,174
I was just doing it for my own interest.
I wasn't looking for anything specific.

760
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:08,109
I just came across this.

761
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:12,106
I'll cut a long story short.

762
01:09:12,582 --> 01:09:13,742
Steve Coogan.

763
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:16,409
Drum roll.

764
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:20,319
The thing is, Steve...

765
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:24,020
you and I are cousins.

766
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:30,966
How do you mean? You mean artistically?

767
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:36,135
No, I mean in the normal way.
We're cousins. We're related.

768
01:09:39,709 --> 01:09:42,701
- It's amazing, isn't it?
- Yeah. Are you sure?

769
01:09:42,712 --> 01:09:44,976
The way it works out is this, look...

770
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:47,872
My great-great grandfather...

771
01:09:48,818 --> 01:09:50,843
is your great-great uncle.

772
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:56,014
And further back, we shared
the same great-great-great grandfather.

773
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:01,497
My ancestry is Irish,
but I knew there was an Italian...

774
01:10:01,698 --> 01:10:04,064
That's it. The Italian connection is...

775
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:07,361
the great-great-great-great grandfather,
Giuseppe.

776
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:10,464
- Isn't that amazing?
- Yeah, this is...

777
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:12,334
This is a lot of detail.

778
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:15,739
- It's my thing, I kind of do a little...
- Amazing.

779
01:10:15,912 --> 01:10:20,178
I think it's just great to be able to say
that I'm related to Steve Coogan.

780
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:24,342
Likewise, I can tell people
I'm related to Albert Molina.

781
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:25,680
Alfred.

782
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:32,355
It's my grandmother who's the big one
on the family tree.

783
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:33,825
She'll be very thrilled.

784
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:37,397
She's a huge fan of your work.
She loved you in...

785
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:41,764
Boogie Nights.

786
01:10:41,938 --> 01:10:44,406
Right, with the shorts and the shotgun?

787
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:46,872
Yeah, she talked about that once.

788
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:48,738
Great.

789
01:10:48,945 --> 01:10:52,904
I know this is coming right out of the blue,
but just think of the possibilities.

790
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:55,380
It's fantastic. Let's look at the facts.

791
01:10:55,551 --> 01:10:59,920
We're both actors.
We're cousins, we've established that.

792
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:04,186
We could maybe work together,
do a play maybe.

793
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,351
We could make a movie.

794
01:11:06,529 --> 01:11:09,123
We could actually do a movie
about this story.

795
01:11:09,298 --> 01:11:12,790
About discovering this amazing thing
between us, that we're cousins.

796
01:11:12,802 --> 01:11:14,702
The story could be two actors...

797
01:11:14,871 --> 01:11:18,739
who discover that they're cousins.
We can actually play ourselves.

798
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:22,604
We'd be in the movie.
I'd be Fred Molina, you'd be Steve...

799
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:25,247
We'd be cousins in the movie.

800
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:29,718
It's fantastic. It'd be great, absolutely great.

801
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:35,754
You know, or not. We could just hang out.

802
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:39,086
We should definitely go
for a beer sometime. That'd be great.

803
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:43,095
Maybe go on vacation together,
just the two of us...

804
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:45,961
sort of get to know each other.

805
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:54,173
You're not gay are you?

806
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:55,835
No.

807
01:11:56,445 --> 01:11:58,003
No, I'm married.

808
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:00,179
So was James I.

809
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:04,483
Sorry. I don't know,
that just popped into my head.

810
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:07,623
- Say it, get it out of the way.
- I understand.

811
01:12:08,124 --> 01:12:09,751
I know exactly what you're thinking.

812
01:12:09,759 --> 01:12:11,989
If somebody came up to me going,
I'm your cousin...

813
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:14,288
I'd think they were a nutter as well.

814
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:15,964
Take it from me, I'm not crazy.

815
01:12:16,132 --> 01:12:20,432
I just think
this is a fantastic, extraordinary...

816
01:12:21,137 --> 01:12:23,537
- Delightful thing for me.
- Absolutely.

817
01:12:23,706 --> 01:12:26,368
- And I just wanted you to know about it.
- Ditto.

818
01:12:26,809 --> 01:12:29,107
All I want, if I want anything...

819
01:12:29,278 --> 01:12:33,806
is for you to just acknowledge
this extraordinary thing...

820
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:38,544
and just love me.

821
01:12:46,896 --> 01:12:48,989
Yeah, I could do that.

822
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:04,540
I have to go.

823
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:08,851
I didn't tell you. I have this meeting.

824
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:11,076
- It actually moved forward.
- I see.

825
01:13:11,254 --> 01:13:15,418
It's at Universal.
Number crunchers, financiers...

826
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:24,756
- This...
- That's for you.

827
01:13:24,934 --> 01:13:26,902
- That's great.
- It's yours.

828
01:13:29,105 --> 01:13:32,871
- I'll make sure that gets filed.
- Sure.

829
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:35,901
You'll be here a couple of days, right?

830
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:38,706
So maybe we could see each other
before you go.

831
01:13:39,882 --> 01:13:42,248
Just checking the mental diary...

832
01:13:47,924 --> 01:13:51,758
This is not good, the time I'm here.

833
01:13:52,028 --> 01:13:54,121
- It's just that it's packed.
- I understand.

834
01:13:54,297 --> 01:13:55,229
No problem.

835
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:59,231
Give me your cell phone number,
and I'll call you before you go.

836
01:13:59,402 --> 01:14:01,131
There's a story there.

837
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:04,402
There's a tri-band system
here in the States...

838
01:14:04,573 --> 01:14:07,440
which is different to the system in the UK...

839
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:09,407
and it's a kind of...

840
01:14:09,912 --> 01:14:13,905
The cell phones, they don't work here.
So I'm kind of cell phone-less...

841
01:14:14,083 --> 01:14:16,210
- in the US.
- I see.

842
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:19,880
Well, give me your home number.
I'll call you.

843
01:14:20,056 --> 01:14:22,081
- You've got my PA's number, right?
- Yeah.

844
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:24,384
Great, then we're connected.

845
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:27,322
Can't you give me your number at home?

846
01:14:30,166 --> 01:14:31,633
Can I say no?

847
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:36,901
Because nothing,
absolutely nothing personal...

848
01:14:37,073 --> 01:14:41,806
It's just that I never
give my number out, ever.

849
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:43,946
It's just a personal space thing.

850
01:14:44,113 --> 01:14:48,277
It's just a rule and I always think,
stick to the rule.

851
01:14:49,085 --> 01:14:51,747
It's more of a philosophy than a rule.

852
01:14:54,957 --> 01:14:58,791
I've not given my number out
to many eminent people in the past.

853
01:14:58,961 --> 01:15:01,327
I once didn't give my number
to Sam Mendes.

854
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:03,465
So you're in good company.

855
01:15:06,102 --> 01:15:09,765
If it's good enough for Sam Mendes,
it's good enough for me.

856
01:15:15,277 --> 01:15:18,212
- I think it's me.
- Right, because mine doesn't work.

857
01:15:18,381 --> 01:15:21,111
I'm sorry, I got to take this. I'll get back.

858
01:15:21,951 --> 01:15:22,940
Hello?

859
01:15:24,387 --> 01:15:25,820
Yeah, sure.

860
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:31,455
Spike, hi. How you doing?

861
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:33,658
You got the message.

862
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:38,027
My agent just called you just to make sure
we're all on the same page.

863
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:43,567
No, the producer credit is just so you and I
can sort of keep tabs on everything.

864
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:46,003
You know, artistic integrity,
that sort of thing.

865
01:15:46,175 --> 01:15:49,042
Otherwise the whole thing
could just run away.

866
01:15:52,014 --> 01:15:54,005
You bastard, no.

867
01:15:55,184 --> 01:15:56,208
All right.

868
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:59,047
You still okay for Sunday? Good. All right.

869
01:15:59,255 --> 01:16:02,190
Will I meet you there?
All right. Nice and early.

870
01:16:02,358 --> 01:16:05,589
Okay, yeah. Lots of love. Bye, Spike.

871
01:16:07,163 --> 01:16:09,688
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's okay, fine.

872
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:15,328
Was that Spike Lee?

873
01:16:15,504 --> 01:16:19,600
No. I don't even know Spike Lee.
That was Spike Jonze.

874
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:24,274
- I love him.
- Yeah, he's a good man.

875
01:16:24,914 --> 01:16:28,111
We've been friends for a long time now.

876
01:16:28,384 --> 01:16:30,545
We're both keen hikers.

877
01:16:31,053 --> 01:16:33,749
- Well, it's very boring.
- No, go on.

878
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:38,386
We belong to a club,
and we go hiking at weekends.

879
01:16:38,794 --> 01:16:42,924
He's a very committed environmentalist.

880
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:47,224
Spike Jonze is a tree-hugger.
Jesus, I never had him down as that.

881
01:16:51,207 --> 01:16:54,301
I think he prefers the term "leaf people"...

882
01:16:55,144 --> 01:16:56,577
as do I.

883
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:04,078
Right, I mean, that's...
Don't get me wrong. That's great.

884
01:17:05,254 --> 01:17:09,418
I love trees.
I think there should be more of them.

885
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:13,117
When I use paper, I use both sides.

886
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:16,458
I would love to...

887
01:17:22,004 --> 01:17:24,837
You know, I'm going to tear up...

888
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:28,173
that stupid rule about phone numbers.

889
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:30,772
It's such shit.

890
01:17:33,082 --> 01:17:36,279
Would it be shabby of me
to give you my number now?

891
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:40,420
Yeah.

892
01:17:50,432 --> 01:17:52,992
I've got to go. I'm so sorry.

893
01:17:55,704 --> 01:17:58,036
- I'll get the check.
- Good.

894
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:13,147
Fuck.

895
01:18:50,526 --> 01:18:53,017
Damn RZA. Where the fuck you at?

896
01:19:06,208 --> 01:19:08,403
- Yo, peace.
- Bobby.

897
01:19:12,348 --> 01:19:14,213
- Pardon me for being late.
- Ain't nothing.

898
01:19:14,383 --> 01:19:18,513
- I was about to hit you on the horn.
- I had a fucking emergency house call, yo.

899
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:20,715
- A house call?
- Yeah, a house call.

900
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:25,224
Sophia and Sifu's children got sick
with the flu and the virus.

901
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:28,563
So I went by,
prescribed some herbal medicines for them.

902
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:32,029
I told them, lay off the dairy products,
chill on the citric acid...

903
01:19:32,201 --> 01:19:34,294
and they should feel a little better.

904
01:19:34,536 --> 01:19:38,472
- So you a doctor now, or something?
- Yeah, I told you.

905
01:19:38,641 --> 01:19:41,769
I've been studying alternative medicine
for two years now, son.

906
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:44,803
I mean, ancient healing techniques,
and all that.

907
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:46,072
Check this.

908
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:50,446
I even know a certain surgical procedure
that I can perform using a drill-gun.

909
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:52,118
Electric drill-gun.

910
01:19:52,821 --> 01:19:54,118
I'm dead serious.

911
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:57,726
But my hands are nice from being a DJ,
you know what I mean?

912
01:19:57,926 --> 01:20:00,724
To me, music and medicine, all go together.

913
01:20:00,896 --> 01:20:03,490
It's like two planets
revolving around the same sun.

914
01:20:03,499 --> 01:20:04,557
So bong-bong.

915
01:20:04,733 --> 01:20:06,394
- Want some tea?
- Yeah, splash me.

916
01:20:06,568 --> 01:20:08,729
It's all herbals, man. No caffeine.

917
01:20:08,904 --> 01:20:12,897
That's what I'm talking about. No caffeine.
Caffeine is ridiculous right now, man.

918
01:20:13,075 --> 01:20:14,508
Tell me about it.

919
01:20:14,677 --> 01:20:17,407
Caffeine leads to depression...

920
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:21,010
makes you all irritable,
have your heart beating fast.

921
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:23,013
Faster heart rate, you know what I mean?

922
01:20:23,185 --> 01:20:26,621
And worse than anything,
you drink that coffee, it gives you the shits.

923
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:29,985
You know what I mean?
So I try to stay away from that.

924
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:33,617
- I'm off that shit, anyway.
- Crisp and clean. No caffeine.

925
01:20:34,163 --> 01:20:38,031
- To Liquid Swords, family.
- No, to Bobby Digital.

926
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,532
- Wu-Tang forever.
- Wu-Tang forever.

927
01:20:42,471 --> 01:20:44,302
Anybody need more coffee?

928
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:46,997
- Kitchen's closing.
- No, we don't mess with caffeine.

929
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:49,144
- You don't?
- No, I don't.

930
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:51,979
Don't you know caffeine
can cause serious delirium?

931
01:20:52,147 --> 01:20:54,172
- Delirium?
- Serious delirium.

932
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:55,942
Now you tell me.

933
01:20:56,952 --> 01:20:59,318
Well, that may be my problem, delirium.

934
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:06,017
Aren't you Bill Murray, man?

935
01:21:06,729 --> 01:21:09,721
- You're Bill Murray?
- Yeah, I'm Bill Murray...

936
01:21:09,898 --> 01:21:12,799
but let's keep that just between us, all right?

937
01:21:14,503 --> 01:21:15,868
Just between us.

938
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:21,038
And you guys are related?

939
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:23,845
Yeah, we're cousins. We're family.

940
01:21:24,012 --> 01:21:27,379
No, you're messing with me
because you're both troublemakers.

941
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:30,517
- Troublemakers?
- The Wu-Tang Clan.

942
01:21:30,686 --> 01:21:32,347
Right, Wu-Tang Clan.

943
01:21:33,055 --> 01:21:35,319
- You're GZA, the genius.
- That's right.

944
01:21:35,491 --> 01:21:38,016
- And you're RZA...
- A.k.a...

945
01:21:39,995 --> 01:21:43,362
- Bobby Digital.
- Yeah, he knows hip-hop.

946
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:45,362
And you're Bill Murray.

947
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:50,103
Bill "Groundhog-Day-Ghostbusting-Ass" Murray.

948
01:21:50,105 --> 01:21:53,199
- Who ya gonna call?
- I know that. Just don't tell anybody.

949
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:55,570
What you mean, don't tell anybody,
Bill Murray?

950
01:21:55,744 --> 01:21:59,236
People will come here, they'll see you.
You're Bill Murray. It's obvious.

951
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:02,009
Unless you're wearing a disguise
or something.

952
01:22:03,185 --> 01:22:05,176
I am wearing kind of a disguise.

953
01:22:07,122 --> 01:22:09,113
Damn, that's harsh, money.

954
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:13,387
- You're a real caffeine junkie, aren't you?
- Keep it down. Just between us.

955
01:22:13,562 --> 01:22:14,961
Here, cheers.

956
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:24,731
You know, before I gave that up...

957
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:28,034
I used to drink it every single night...

958
01:22:28,210 --> 01:22:32,078
up until it was time to go to sleep.
Used to make me dream faster.

959
01:22:32,247 --> 01:22:35,774
You know, like when they flash
those cameras on those Indy 500 cars...

960
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:37,578
and they just...

961
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:43,918
That's how my dreams were.
Just whizzing by.

962
01:22:44,226 --> 01:22:47,093
- You're stupid, yo.
- He is stupid, isn't he?

963
01:22:47,296 --> 01:22:48,593
Word, yo.

964
01:22:52,668 --> 01:22:55,068
I know a guy who freezes coffee.

965
01:22:55,838 --> 01:22:58,773
Puts sticks in it,
has himself a coffee Popsicle.

966
01:22:58,941 --> 01:23:01,000
A caf pop.

967
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:09,109
Damn. That don't sound too good,
Bill Murray.

968
01:23:09,284 --> 01:23:12,685
It's not the flu or anything.
It's just a smoker's cough.

969
01:23:14,923 --> 01:23:19,155
That's what I'm saying, nicotine interferes
with your central nervous system...

970
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:21,125
your respiratorial system.

971
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:24,788
In very small doses, it causes paralysis.

972
01:23:29,104 --> 01:23:31,470
- Really?
- Yeah, really, man.

973
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:34,039
I mean, just 50mg alone...

974
01:23:34,643 --> 01:23:37,009
have been proven to be fatal
in a few minutes.

975
01:23:37,179 --> 01:23:39,807
- How much is in one cigarette?
- 3mg.

976
01:23:40,315 --> 01:23:43,307
And did you know
they also use nicotine for insecticide...

977
01:23:43,485 --> 01:23:46,545
- to kill bugs?
- It's good if it kills bugs, right?

978
01:23:48,056 --> 01:23:50,149
Are you a bug, Bill Murray?

979
01:23:52,194 --> 01:23:55,357
- Jesus, RZA, you sound like my doctor.
- He is a doctor.

980
01:23:55,797 --> 01:23:59,198
Actually, he specializes
in alternative medicine.

981
01:23:59,735 --> 01:24:02,295
That is, alternative to this planet.

982
01:24:06,542 --> 01:24:10,842
Do me a favor and don't tell anybody
you saw me here, okay?

983
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:13,639
You can trust us, Bill Murray.

984
01:24:16,485 --> 01:24:20,512
- You hiding out or something?
- Yeah, sort of, something like that.

985
01:24:22,391 --> 01:24:24,325
Now I'm thinking it may be delirium.

986
01:24:24,493 --> 01:24:26,518
- Serious delirium.
- Serious.

987
01:24:27,563 --> 01:24:31,556
If you're on the low, I got something
that'll help you with your disguise.

988
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:33,690
Take this.

989
01:24:34,436 --> 01:24:36,199
- Use whatever you want.
- Jeez.

990
01:24:36,405 --> 01:24:40,205
- Rock that, man. Stay on the low.
- You didn't have to do this. This is great.

991
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:41,933
A bag of items for you, Bill.

992
01:24:41,944 --> 01:24:43,707
- Thank you.
- Don't worry about it.

993
01:24:43,912 --> 01:24:45,573
I really appreciate this.

994
01:24:47,683 --> 01:24:48,877
This is great.

995
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:53,054
Doc, what could I do for this cough?

996
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:55,780
I was just thinking about that.
Check this out.

997
01:24:55,958 --> 01:24:59,894
- You get some hydrogen peroxide.
- We got that for cuts and stuff.

998
01:25:00,062 --> 01:25:03,395
Take 50% hydrogen peroxide, 50% water.

999
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:06,227
You gargle with it.
Do not swallow, you spit it out.

1000
01:25:06,401 --> 01:25:07,732
Don't swallow, Bill Murray.

1001
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:10,905
And if that doesn't work, try oven cleaner.

1002
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:14,234
I got that in the back, too.

1003
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:16,305
- Thank you.
- Cool.

1004
01:25:16,545 --> 01:25:19,241
Thank you. I'm going to try it right now.

1005
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:23,417
- Word.
- Word, man.

1006
01:25:23,619 --> 01:25:26,383
- Bill motherfucking Murray.
- It's crazy, yo.

1007
01:25:29,157 --> 01:25:30,886
- 3:00.
- What's up?

1008
01:25:31,093 --> 01:25:33,618
I told Ghost to be here by 3:00 a.m.

1009
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:37,162
Don't hold your breath on that.
You know how it is waiting on Ghost.

1010
01:25:37,165 --> 01:25:40,100
- We'll be here all night.
- Think we can smoke a blunt up here?

1011
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:44,068
- It's hot up in here with the 5-0.
- But we used to always smoke weed in here.

1012
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:46,935
That was until Dirt Dog done blew it up.

1013
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:50,111
Told Deflon,
"Never let Dirty inside this spot, man".

1014
01:25:50,278 --> 01:25:52,178
So what's up? What you want to do?

1015
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:54,580
- Yo, let's slide to the 'udio.
- Hit the 'udio, right.

1016
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:56,741
Play some chess? All right, then.

1017
01:25:56,918 --> 01:26:00,581
- Is that the bill for Murray?
- He don't need no money, yo.

1018
01:26:00,756 --> 01:26:03,486
- Hit him, anyway.
- Think I should tip him?

1019
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:11,663
- You think he's using the oven cleaner?
- Don't know, but let's get the fuck out.

1020
01:26:37,292 --> 01:26:39,192
Are you all right, Taylor?

1021
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:44,897
- No, not really.
- What's up?

1022
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:51,070
I don't know.
I feel so divorced from the world.

1023
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,235
I've lost touch with the world.

1024
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:58,578
Do you know that song by Mahler...

1025
01:27:00,148 --> 01:27:03,675
- I've Lost Track of the World?
- No.

1026
01:27:05,353 --> 01:27:08,322
It's one of the most beautiful...

1027
01:27:08,490 --> 01:27:10,856
and saddest songs ever written.

1028
01:27:15,163 --> 01:27:17,097
I can almost hear it now.

1029
01:27:22,771 --> 01:27:24,363
Can you hear it?

1030
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:18,391
It's gone now.

1031
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:22,062
- But did you hear it?
- I think so.

1032
01:28:25,834 --> 01:28:29,065
It resonated
right through the whole building.

1033
01:28:31,239 --> 01:28:34,003
- Where are we?
- In the armory, Taylor.

1034
01:28:35,911 --> 01:28:37,902
The armory, Taylor.

1035
01:28:40,515 --> 01:28:43,973
It sounds so heavy and ponderous.

1036
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,112
The armory.

1037
01:28:48,657 --> 01:28:51,455
Nikola Tesla...

1038
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:56,430
perceived the Earth as a conductor...

1039
01:28:57,165 --> 01:29:00,464
of acoustical resonance.

1040
01:29:04,105 --> 01:29:06,869
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1041
01:29:09,211 --> 01:29:11,179
Can you explain it to me?

1042
01:29:11,446 --> 01:29:14,040
- No, not really.
- I know.

1043
01:29:15,217 --> 01:29:17,617
Let's pretend this coffee is champagne.

1044
01:29:19,621 --> 01:29:21,384
Why would we do that?

1045
01:29:22,157 --> 01:29:24,182
Well, to celebrate life.

1046
01:29:25,827 --> 01:29:29,024
You know, like the rich, elegant people do.

1047
01:29:30,165 --> 01:29:31,894
The classy people.

1048
01:29:33,401 --> 01:29:37,394
I prefer coffee.
Simple, working man's coffee.

1049
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:44,338
You're so provincial, Bill.
Do you know what your problem is?

1050
01:29:45,914 --> 01:29:47,006
What?

1051
01:29:48,884 --> 01:29:52,581
You have no joie de vivre.

1052
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:56,050
I don't?

1053
01:29:57,826 --> 01:30:01,353
No, besides, this coffee is awful.

1054
01:30:04,065 --> 01:30:07,557
- You're right. It really is bad, isn't it?
- Dreadful.

1055
01:30:08,904 --> 01:30:10,895
I propose a toast.

1056
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:14,240
So what should we toast?

1057
01:30:17,512 --> 01:30:20,709
Paris in the 1920s.

1058
01:30:21,082 --> 01:30:23,915
Josephine Baker, the Moulin Rouge.

1059
01:30:24,586 --> 01:30:26,713
What is it? Okay?

1060
01:30:28,356 --> 01:30:29,687
And also...

1061
01:30:30,525 --> 01:30:33,050
New York in the '70s.

1062
01:30:33,395 --> 01:30:35,386
In the late '70s.

1063
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:38,129
Really? All right.

1064
01:30:38,867 --> 01:30:40,630
Cheers.

1065
01:30:46,241 --> 01:30:47,902
Delicious, isn't it?

1066
01:30:50,045 --> 01:30:53,537
Champagne, nectar of the gods.

1067
01:30:55,250 --> 01:30:58,413
Is that all you're having for lunch,
coffee and a cigarette?

1068
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:00,383
It's not very healthy.

1069
01:31:02,123 --> 01:31:03,920
We had lunch earlier.

1070
01:31:07,395 --> 01:31:08,589
We did?

1071
01:31:10,231 --> 01:31:14,327
We're on a break here, a coffee break.

1072
01:31:16,004 --> 01:31:17,767
How depressing.

1073
01:31:19,174 --> 01:31:21,267
How long is our break, anyway?

1074
01:31:21,443 --> 01:31:24,742
About 10 minutes, and it's nearly over now.

1075
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:30,645
Say it isn't true.

1076
01:31:33,421 --> 01:31:35,412
- Well?
- What?

1077
01:31:36,624 --> 01:31:39,354
I asked you to say it isn't true.

1078
01:31:39,995 --> 01:31:41,690
