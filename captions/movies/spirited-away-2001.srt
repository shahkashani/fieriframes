3
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:16,096
Good luck, Chihiro
Hope we meet again

4
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:19,098
Chihiro? Chihiro!

5
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,770
We're almost there.

6
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,608
This really is the
middle of nowhere.

7
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:28,569
I'll have to shop in the next town.

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,818
We'll just have to make do.

9
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,159
Look, there's the
elementary school.

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,158
That's your new school, Chihiro.

11
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,282
Why, it looks very nice.

12
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,126
I liked my old school.

13
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:57,181
Mom, my flowers got bent.

14
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,809
No wonder, the way
you squeeze them.

15
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,980
A little water and
they'll perk right up.

16
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:07,525
My first bouquet, and
it's farewell flowers.

17
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:11,112
What about the rose you
got for your birthday?

18
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:14,282
One rose? One rose isn't a bouquet.

19
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:16,033
You dropped the card.

20
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:20,614
Now pull yourself together.
This is a busy day for us.

21
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:45,018
SPIRITED AWAY

22
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,371
Wait a minute. Did I
take a wrong turn?

23
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,205
I don't get it.

24
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,534
That must be it up there.

25
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:08,416
The blue one on the end.

26
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,172
That's it.

27
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,250
I guess I turned off too soon.

28
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,343
Maybe if we go straight?

29
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:17,970
Oh, please. That's how
we always get lost.

30
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,173
Let's just see what's up here.

31
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,220
- What are those things?
- Houses for the guardian spirits.

32
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,610
Dad, are you sure?

33
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:35,405
Don't worry, we've
got 4-wheel drive.

34
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,361
Sit down, Chihiro.

35
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,842
What are you doing? Slow down!

36
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,682
There's a tunnel.

37
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,781
What's this building?

38
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,825
It looks like a gate.

39
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,784
Honey, I think we should go back.

40
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,824
Chihiro!

41
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,330
Honestly...

42
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:32,086
Look at this, it's just plaster.

43
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:34,289
This thing's pretty new.

44
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,801
The air's blowing in.

45
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,309
What is it?

46
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,808
Let's see what's on the other side.

47
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,558
It's creepy, Dad. Can't we go back?

48
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:56,944
Don't be such a chicken.
C'mon, let's take a look.

49
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,238
The movers will be there soon.

50
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,409
So? They've got the keys.
They'll handle everything.

51
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,577
I know, but...

52
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,746
No! I won't go.

53
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,708
Dad, let's go.

54
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,334
Come on, it'll be fun.

55
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,208
I'm staying here!

56
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,965
Chihiro, you wait in the car.

57
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,806
Mom...

58
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,097
Wait up!

59
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,195
Watch your step.

60
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:42,741
Chihiro, don't cling.
You'll make me trip.

61
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:18,064
- What is this?
- Wait, hear that?

62
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,703
- A train.
- Maybe we're near a station.

63
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,747
Let's find out. It must be close.

64
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,619
Houses, way out here?

65
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,447
I knew it.

66
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,621
It's an abandoned theme park.

67
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,754
They built lots of them
back in the nineties.

68
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,458
But they went bust when
the economy tanked.

69
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:26,051
This must be one of them.

70
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,137
Wait, where are we going?

71
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,966
Let's go back, Dad.

72
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,600
Please!

73
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:48,112
Mom, that building's moaning.

74
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,450
It's just the wind.

75
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:54,449
What a lovely spot. We should've
brought the sandwiches.

76
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,327
This would've been a river.

77
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,464
Do you smell something?

78
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,304
- Something smells good.
- You're right.

79
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:13,304
Maybe they're open for
business after all.

80
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,100
Hurry up, Chihiro.

81
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,395
Wait for me!

82
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,846
This way.

83
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:59,353
Can you believe it?
Nothing but restaurants.

84
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,727
There's nobody here.

85
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,693
Over there.

86
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,029
Come on!

87
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,746
Come take a look.

88
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,425
This is amazing.

89
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:32,469
Hello, is anybody here?

90
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,093
Come on, Chihiro.
It looks delicious.

91
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,557
You got customers!

92
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,940
Don't worry. We'll pay
when they show up.

93
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,609
You're right. Let's see now...

94
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,938
What kind of bird is this?

95
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:54,572
It's delicious! Chihiro, try some.

96
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,069
I don't want any.

97
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:59,201
Can't we go? They'll be mad at us.

98
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:02,583
Don't worry, your father's here.

99
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,912
I've got credit cards and cash.

100
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,589
Have some, Chihiro.
It's very tender.

101
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,304
- Mustard.
- Thanks.

102
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,689
Mom! Dad!

103
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,597
What a weird building.

104
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,128
A train!

105
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,591
You can't be here. Go now!

106
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:27,604
It's almost sundown.
Go before it gets dark!

107
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,316
They're lighting the
lamps. Come on!

108
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:35,111
I'll hold them off.
Get across the river!

109
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,453
What's his problem?

110
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,171
Dad?

111
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,764
Dad, let's go home.

112
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,683
Let's go, Dad!

113
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,954
Dad!

114
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,501
Mom!

115
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,966
Mommy!

116
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,038
Water!

117
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,636
No...

118
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,589
It's just a dream.

119
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,469
Wake up, wake up. Wake up!

120
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,476
Please wake up.

121
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:42,238
It's just a dream, a stupid dream.

122
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,321
Go away, disappear.

123
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,113
Disappear.

124
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,619
I'm fading away!

125
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,883
This has to be a dream.

126
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,975
Don't be afraid. I'm a friend.

127
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,140
No, no, no!

128
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,274
Open your mouth. Eat this.

129
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:04,152
Unless you eat something from
this world, you'll disappear.

130
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,650
No!

131
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:12,744
Don't worry. You won't
turn into a pig.

132
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,822
Chew it and swallow.

133
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,800
Good, now you'll be fine.

134
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,674
See for yourself.

135
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,061
I can touch you.

136
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,480
Of course. Now come.

137
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:44,686
Where's Mom and Dad?
Did they really turn into pigs?

138
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,446
You can't see them
now, but you will.

139
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,738
Quiet!

140
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:13,097
It's looking for you.
There's no time, let's run.

141
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,892
I can't stand up. What should I do?

142
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:20,934
- My legs don't work.
- Relax and take a deep breath.

143
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:28,813
In the name of the wind and
water within, unbind her.

144
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,064
Stand up!

145
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:15,322
Don't breathe while
we're on the bridge.

146
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:21,707
One tiny breath will break my spell.
We don't want anyone to see you.

147
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,338
I'm scared.

148
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,048
Be calm.

149
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,176
Welcome, your presence honors us.

150
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,596
Greetings, welcome.

151
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:39,095
- I've finished my rounds.
- Welcome back, sir.

152
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:42,053
Take a deep breath.

153
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,312
Hold it.

154
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:04,997
Welcome back. We've
been waiting for you.

155
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,086
Just a little further.

156
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,589
Master Haku!

157
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,959
Where have you...

158
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,170
A human?

159
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,304
Run!

160
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,073
Master Haku, Master Haku!

161
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,826
I smell something.
A human intruder!

162
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,203
I smell humans!
The stench of humans!

163
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,998
- They know you're here.
- Sorry, I messed up.

164
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,372
No, Chihiro, you did very well.

165
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,086
Now listen. I'll
tell you what to do.

166
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,880
If you stay here, they'll find you.

167
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,759
I'll distract them
while you get away.

168
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,383
No, don't go! Stay with me, please.

169
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,973
You have no choice, if you
want to survive here...

170
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,892
and save your parents, too.

171
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:07,520
So I wasn't dreaming.
They did turn into pigs.

172
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,143
Listen carefully.

173
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:13,443
After I'm gone, go
through the back gate.

174
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:16,488
Take the stairs all the way down.

175
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,698
You'll find the
boiler room where...

176
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,367
they stoke the fires.

177
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:23,868
Look for Kamaji.

178
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,364
Kamaji?

179
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,750
Ask him for work.

180
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,624
If he refuses, keep asking.

181
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,628
If you don't work, Yubaba
will turn you into an animal.

182
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,216
Yubaba?

183
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:39,136
She's the sorceress
who rules our world.

184
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,597
She'll try to trick
you into leaving...

185
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,391
but keep asking for work.

186
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:49,348
The work's hard, but it will protect you.
Then even Yubaba can't harm you.

187
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:53,397
Master Haku, Master Haku!

188
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:54,734
I have to go.

189
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:59,156
- Remember I'm your friend, Chihiro.
- How did you know my name?

190
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,655
You told me long ago.

191
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,910
My name is Haku.

192
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,623
Here I am!

193
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,752
Master Haku, Yubaba's waiting.

194
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,957
I know, I've been searching too.

195
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,998
Um...

196
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:28,217
Excuse me.

197
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,391
Um...

198
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,442
Are you Kamaji?

199
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:56,908
Haku sent me. Please
let me work here.

200
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:04,750
What, all at once?

201
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,665
Get to work, you little runts!

202
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:14,053
I am Kamaji, slave to the
boilers that heat the baths.

203
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,427
Step on it, boys!

204
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,600
Please let me work here.

205
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:23,980
I've got all the help I need.
There's soot everywhere.

206
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:27,105
I'll never run out of help.

207
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,533
Oh, I'm sorry.

208
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:49,298
Wait a second.

209
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,636
Out of the way.

210
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:57,942
Wait, what do I do with this?

211
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,329
Do I leave it here?

212
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,828
Finish what you start.

213
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:12,231
Get to work, runts! Wanna
turn back into soot?

214
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:16,068
And you, better watch it. You
can't just take someone's work.

215
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:19,697
If they don't work, their
spell will be broken.

216
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:23,027
There's no work for you here.
Try somewhere else.

217
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,462
You sootballs got a problem?

218
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,165
Get to work!

219
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:38,834
Chow time!

220
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:41,549
What, you guys at it again?

221
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:46,387
Give it a rest. Where's your bowl?

222
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,344
I keep telling you to leave it out.

223
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,143
Food's here. Break time!

224
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,789
The human! You're gonna catch it.

225
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,209
They're having a fit
about it upstairs.

226
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,127
She's my granddaughter.

227
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,796
Your granddaughter!

228
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:21,300
She says she wants work,
but I don't need any help.

229
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:24,971
Could you take her
to Yubaba for me?

230
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:26,889
This girl can handle herself.

231
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,433
Not a chance. Yubaba would kill me.

232
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:34,435
Not even for this? Charcoal-roasted
newt, finest quality.

233
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:40,444
If you want work, you have to
sign a contract with Yubaba.

234
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,864
Might as well try your luck.

235
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:46,868
Fine! You there, follow me.

236
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,626
What about "Yes, ma'am"
or "Thank you"?

237
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,128
Yes, ma'am.

238
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,629
What a klutz. Move it!

239
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,797
Yes, ma'am.

240
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:05,386
Leave the shoes. And the socks!

241
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:06,759
Yes'm.

242
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:16,185
Aren't you going to thank Kamaji?
He's looking out for you.

243
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,359
Thank you very much.

244
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,188
Good luck.

245
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:35,743
Yubaba lives on the top
floor in the back.

246
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:52,601
Move it, will you?

247
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,481
You'll lose your nose.

248
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,009
- One more elevator after this.
- Yes'm.

249
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,639
We're here.

250
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:36,345
Welcome, sir!

251
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:46,735
This elevator stops here.
Please use another one.

252
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,884
- He's following us.
- Quit gawking.

253
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:29,565
Here we are.

254
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,829
Your room is on the right.

255
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,830
- Lin?
- Yes, sir!

256
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,168
Something smells.

257
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,923
It's human. You reek of human.

258
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,467
Is that so?

259
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:52,929
I smell it, I do. Smells
mighty tasty, too.

260
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,928
You're hiding something.

261
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,350
Tell me the truth.

262
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,803
Maybe it's this.

263
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,521
Roasted newt? Give it here!

264
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:05,942
Not a chance. The girls
asked me to get it.

265
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:09,188
I'm begging you.
I'll settle for a leg.

266
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:13,200
Pull the lever to go up, sir.

267
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,548
Can't you even knock?

268
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:04,311
What a plain little girl.

269
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,564
Now, come.

270
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,952
I said, come!

271
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,674
Ow...

272
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,892
What a racket. Could you be quiet?

273
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,036
Please...

274
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:14,540
Let me work here.

275
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:26,016
Stop your babbling.

276
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:29,517
Why do I need a weakling like you?

277
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:34,017
Besides, this is no
place for humans.

278
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,444
Millions of spirits come here...

279
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:41,491
to purge themselves
of toil and care.

280
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,536
Your parents, my goodness!
They certainly had some nerve.

281
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:49,248
Gobbling our guests' food
like a couple of pigs.

282
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:51,577
Just deserts, I'd say.

283
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:57,420
And as for you, you'll never
see your world again either.

284
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,971
You'd make a lovely piglet.

285
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:07,176
Or perhaps a lump of coal?

286
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,483
Trembling, aren't you?

287
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:20,237
Still, I'm impressed
you made it this far.

288
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,692
Someone must've helped you.

289
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,993
I must thank your friend.

290
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:30,825
Just who was it, my dear?
You can tell me.

291
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,294
Please let me work here!

292
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:36,962
Not that again!

293
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,585
I want to work here!

294
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:43,842
Shut your mouth!

295
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:51,185
Why on earth should I hire you?

296
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:55,647
Anyone can see you're a lazy,
spoiled, stupid crybaby.

297
00:37:55,648 --> 00:38:00,778
What job would I possibly
have for someone like you?

298
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:06,861
You're wasting your time.
I've got all the bums I need.

299
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:11,955
Or maybe I'll give you the
nastiest job I've got...

300
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,124
and work you night and day...

301
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:19,252
until you breathe your
very last breath!

302
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:35,055
Now, now. What's wrong, my dear?

303
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,562
I'm coming. That's a good baby.

304
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:41,566
Are you still here?
Get out, right now.

305
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,605
I want to work here!

306
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:47,241
Keep your voice down.

307
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:51,117
I'll be right there,
just be patient.

308
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,624
That's a good baby. There, there.

309
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,917
Please give me a job!

310
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:59,917
All right, just pipe down.

311
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:04,797
There, there, good baby.

312
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:26,648
That's your contract.

313
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:29,655
Sign on the bottom line.

314
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,778
I'll put you to work.

315
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:35,289
But one peep out of
you about anything...

316
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,959
and I'll turn you into a piglet.

317
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,627
Should I sign here?

318
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:44,332
Where else? Quit dilly-dallying.

319
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:51,134
Unbelievable.

320
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:54,475
What a ridiculous oath I took.

321
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:59,480
I'm bound to give
work to whoever asks.

322
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:03,606
- Finished?
- Yes.

323
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:10,700
- Chihiro, that's your name?
- Yes.

324
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:13,657
Quite a fancy name.

325
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,874
From now on, your name is Sen.

326
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:28,091
Understand? Sen.

327
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,886
Answer me, Sen!

328
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,429
I understand.

329
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,847
Yes ma'am?

330
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:41,264
- See to her, she's starting work today.
- Very well.

331
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,140
What is your name?

332
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,902
Chi... I mean, Sen.

333
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,359
Then follow me, Sen.

334
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:59,207
Haku, I...

335
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:01,124
No idle chatter.

336
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,669
Call me Master Haku.

337
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:22,479
I'm afraid even Yubaba can't
give an order like that.

338
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,353
Humans aren't allowed here.

339
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,316
She signed the contract.

340
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,736
- What!
- I'll work hard.

341
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,490
- Don't send her to us.
- She stinks to high heaven.

342
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,993
She won't stink after
three days of our food.

343
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:40,415
If she doesn't measure up,
do with her as you will.

344
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,418
Now go back to work. Where's Lin?

345
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:46,997
What, you're dumping her on me?

346
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:48,714
You wanted an assistant.

347
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:51,839
That's right! Lin's just perfect.

348
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,260
Go, Sen.

349
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:54,462
Yes sir.

350
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:58,599
What a pain. You're
gonna pay for this.

351
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,723
Off you go.

352
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,392
Come on.

353
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,733
You pulled it off!

354
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:17,486
You're so thick, I was worried.

355
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:21,577
Keep your wits about you.
If you need anything, ask me.

356
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,996
What's wrong?

357
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:28,000
My legs are shaking.

358
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,586
This is where we live.

359
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,964
Eat, sleep and you'll be fine.

360
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,844
Your apron. Keep it clean.

361
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,227
Trousers.

362
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:47,102
You're so puny.

363
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,267
Too big.

364
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,819
Lin, are there...

365
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,945
What?

366
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,198
Are there two Hakus here?

367
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:59,903
Two of that one? I sure hope not.

368
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,411
Still too big.

369
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:04,365
He's Yubaba's apprentice.
Be careful around him.

370
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,958
Now where was that...

371
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,836
All right, here we go.

372
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:18,296
Hey, are you okay?
Don't fall apart on me.

373
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:21,431
What's all the noise, Lin?

374
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:24,055
New girl. Says she feels faint.

375
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:00,315
Meet me at the bridge. I'll take
you to your mother and father.

376
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:45,697
My shoes are gone.

377
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:01,626
Thank you.

378
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:11,537
Follow me.

379
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:57,166
Dad, Mom, it's me!

380
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,997
It's Sen.

381
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:02,080
Mom! Dad!

382
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:07,092
Are they sick? Are they hurt?

383
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:10,012
They're just sleeping.
Their stomachs are full.

384
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,678
They don't remember
they were ever human.

385
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:21,648
Listen to me! I promise
I'll save you.

386
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:25,023
Don't get too fat
or they'll eat you.

387
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,912
Hide these.

388
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:39,166
I thought they were gone.

389
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,501
For when you go home.

390
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:49,969
This was a farewell card.

391
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,880
Chihiro?

392
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:56,392
Chihiro... That's my name!

393
00:48:57,226 --> 00:48:59,895
Yubaba controls us by
stealing our names.

394
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:04,734
You're Sen here. Keep
your real name a secret.

395
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:08,146
She almost got my name.
I was turning into Sen.

396
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:12,241
Without your real name, you'll
never find your way home.

397
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:15,660
I no longer remember mine.

398
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,659
Your real name?

399
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:21,208
But it's strange, I remember yours.

400
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:26,255
Better eat, you must be hungry.

401
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:27,915
I don't want to.

402
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:32,303
I put a spell on them to
give you back your strength.

403
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:11,375
You've had a rough time.
Better eat more.

404
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:27,482
You know the way back.

405
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:30,357
Thanks Haku. I promise
to work hard.

406
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,707
Where were you? I was worried.

407
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:09,125
Sorry.

408
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,261
Out of the way.

409
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,353
Come on, give it some elbow grease.

410
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:38,447
Starting today, you two
are on the big tub.

411
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,657
What? That's Frog work!

412
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:43,953
Orders from the top.
And no shirking, either.

413
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,970
Aren't you getting wet?

414
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:11,604
Sen, come on!

415
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,064
Coming!

416
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:14,983
I'll leave this open.

417
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,888
- On the big tub, Lin?
- Stuff it.

418
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:51,682
Just look at this. Hasn't
been scrubbed in ages.

419
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:09,328
The big tub is reserved
for our filthiest guests.

420
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:11,202
It's caked with sludge.

421
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:13,958
Lin! Sen! First
customers are coming.

422
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,668
All right already!

423
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:18,004
Man, this is pure harassment.

424
00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:21,257
Go get a tag from the foreman.

425
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,550
A tag?

426
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:27,214
For an herbal bath.

427
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:28,716
Right.

428
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:31,468
Lin, what's a foreman?

429
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:38,521
Something's coming. I wonder...

430
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:51,372
ls some good-for-nothing
using the rain to sneak in?

431
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:18,140
Absolutely not, it's
too valuable to waste.

432
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,063
Good morning!

433
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,485
Feeling refreshed?

434
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:23,986
For Kasuga.

435
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,360
One deluxe sulfur bath.

436
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:29,201
No point standing there.
Back to work.

437
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:31,035
Scrub it with your hands.

438
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:32,954
Good morning!

439
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:34,121
Your bare hands.

440
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:37,500
But she said it has
to be an herbal bath.

441
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:39,252
You just don't get it.

442
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:41,421
Mugwort, right?

443
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:43,715
Relax and enjoy.

444
00:55:52,558 --> 00:55:55,432
Foreman. Yes ma'am!

445
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:58,479
Thank you!

446
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,806
But that's not...

447
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:01,399
Hey you, wait!

448
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,400
What's the trouble?

449
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:04,023
Oh, nothing at all.

450
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,903
We have an intruder.

451
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:06,821
A human?

452
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:10,026
You figure it out.
Haku's gone today.

453
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,535
Wow, you got a really good one.

454
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:15,285
This goes straight to Kamaji.

455
00:56:16,665 --> 00:56:18,708
Water should be right up.

456
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:27,672
Yank this for hot water.
Go ahead, try it.

457
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:38,644
You're really are a klutz.

458
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,855
Look at that color.

459
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:43,354
This one has dried worm salts.

460
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:46,858
With water this murky,
who's gonna see the sludge?

461
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:51,824
Yank it again when
it's full. It'll stop.

462
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:55,536
You can let go now.
I'll go get our breakfast.

463
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:56,989
Okay.

464
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,430
Ouch!

465
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:28,149
Um... The bath's not ready yet.

466
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:35,160
So many...

467
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:39,786
They're for me?

468
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,412
But I don't need them.

469
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:49,917
No, you gave me one already.

470
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:05,731
Madam!

471
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:09,402
- It's a Stink Spirit.
- Yes, and a large one, too.

472
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:11,278
It's headed straight
for the bridge!

473
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:13,857
Please turn back.

474
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:17,866
Please go! The baths are
closed for the night.

475
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:20,538
Please withdraw, please!

476
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:23,367
Stinky!

477
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:27,378
That's odd. Stink
Spirits feel different.

478
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:30,128
Well, now that it's here,
better go greet it!

479
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:34,382
All we can do is get
rid of it fast.

480
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,721
Everyone, please
return to your rooms!

481
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:38,640
Please hurry. Terribly sorry!

482
00:58:40,392 --> 00:58:42,643
Lin and Sen, Yubaba wants you.

483
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:43,640
Yes sir!

484
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:46,397
Pay attention, this is your debut.

485
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:49,397
Show the customer to the big tub.

486
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,395
Remember, one peep out
of you and you're coal.

487
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:55,570
- Got it?
- It has arrived.

488
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:07,961
No, that's not polite!

489
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:19,472
Welgum to our bazz.

490
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:24,769
Oh... Money...!

491
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:27,438
Hurry Sen, take it!

492
00:59:27,439 --> 00:59:28,891
Yez ma'am.

493
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:41,702
Wud are you wading for?
Show him to da bazz!

494
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:43,655
Diz way...

495
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:03,846
Sen!

496
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:10,641
Horrible!

497
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:12,608
Breakfast!

498
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,903
Open the windows, all of 'em!

499
01:00:57,904 --> 01:01:00,778
What? Just a minute.

500
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:09,081
- That's really filthy.
- It's not funny.

501
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:10,875
What will she do?

502
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:17,798
Ah, she's going to refill the tub.

503
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:21,924
Oh dear, she's soiling the
walls with her dirty hands!

504
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:35,900
Did you give Sen new tags?

505
01:01:35,901 --> 01:01:38,729
Never, what a waste!

506
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:22,647
All that precious herbal essence!

507
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:50,891
Sen! Sen, where are you?

508
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:53,269
- Lin!
- Are yo u okay?

509
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:56,144
I asked Kamaji to help us out.

510
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:58,775
He's sending his
best herbal essence.

511
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:02,319
Thanks. There's a thorn or
something stuck in him.

512
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,445
A thorn?

513
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,273
I can't pull it out.

514
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:08,117
A thorn? Hmm...

515
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:11,161
Get everyone downstairs!

516
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:12,158
Hurry!

517
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:17,209
Sen and Lin!

518
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:19,788
Our guest is no Stink Spirit.

519
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:23,382
Use this rope.

520
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:24,675
Yes ma'am!

521
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:34,928
Tie it good and tight!

522
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:40,143
Hurry up! Girls, lend a hand!

523
01:03:40,275 --> 01:03:42,148
It's tied!

524
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:46,655
Everyone ready? All together now!

525
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:49,655
Heave!

526
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:52,153
And heave!

527
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:54,580
Heave!

528
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:56,909
Heave!

529
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:05,671
A bicycle?

530
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:09,671
I knew it. Now, heave!

531
01:04:09,721 --> 01:04:12,424
Heave!

532
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:46,625
Sen, are you all right?

533
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:59,600
Well done.

534
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:31,135
Gold! It's gold!

535
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:33,846
Hands off! That's company property.

536
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:37,517
Quiet! Our guest is still with us.

537
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:46,316
Sen, you're in the way.
Get down from there.

538
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:49,020
Open the main gates! He's leaving!

539
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:19,885
Sen, you're a wonder!
You made us a fortune.

540
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:23,103
That was the guardian
of a great river.

541
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:24,977
Everyone, learn from Sen!

542
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:27,558
Sake on the house tonight.

543
01:06:27,859 --> 01:06:30,733
Now hand over all
that gold you picked up.

544
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:46,369
Want some? I swiped them.

545
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:48,212
Thanks.

546
01:06:48,213 --> 01:06:50,586
What a day.

547
01:06:52,884 --> 01:06:54,426
Haku missed the whole thing.

548
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,504
Not Haku again!

549
01:06:57,222 --> 01:06:59,800
Sometimes he just disappears.

550
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:03,936
They say Yubaba makes
him do bad stuff.

551
01:07:03,937 --> 01:07:04,895
Really?

552
01:07:04,896 --> 01:07:06,396
Lights out, Lin.

553
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:07,644
Okay.

554
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:35,467
There's a town. And the
water's like an ocean.

555
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:38,672
What did you expect
after all that rain?

556
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:44,511
I'm gonna get there someday.
I'll get out of here for sure.

557
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:10,336
What's wrong?

558
01:08:39,699 --> 01:08:41,401
Gold!

559
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:47,164
Who are you? You're no customer.

560
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:49,117
You're not allowed in there.

561
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:58,919
Hey, it's gold! For me?

562
01:09:04,015 --> 01:09:06,559
You can make gold?

563
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:13,065
Gimme!

564
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:22,992
Who's down here?

565
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:26,404
It's way past lights out.

566
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:33,168
Hey boss, I'm hungry.

567
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:34,378
Starved, in fact.

568
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:35,379
That voice...

569
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:37,503
There, I'll pay you now.

570
01:09:38,049 --> 01:09:40,801
I'm a customer. I want a bath.

571
01:09:40,802 --> 01:09:42,629
Wake everyone up!

572
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:51,395
Mom and Dad, the river guardian
gave me this medicine.

573
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:54,475
If you take it, you'll
be people again.

574
01:09:58,403 --> 01:10:00,605
Dad, Mom, where are you?

575
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,232
Daddy!

576
01:10:13,126 --> 01:10:14,498
What an awful dream.

577
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,292
Lin?

578
01:10:21,259 --> 01:10:23,006
Where is everybody?

579
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:32,307
Wow, it really did
turn into an ocean!

580
01:10:37,358 --> 01:10:40,562
I can see where Mom and
Dad are from here.

581
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:46,158
Kamaji lit the fires already.

582
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:48,282
Did I sleep that long?

583
01:10:51,748 --> 01:10:54,875
The customer's waiting.
Can't you work faster?

584
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:59,081
Serve everything you've
got, even leftovers!

585
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:01,882
Sen!

586
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:03,084
Lin?

587
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:06,045
I was just coming to
wake you up, look!

588
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:08,548
Gold! He gave me real gold.

589
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:10,849
We've got a real high roller.

590
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:13,428
Please, sir, try this!

591
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:20,184
Throw us some gold!

592
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:25,531
I'm starving, bring it all!

593
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:31,446
Who's this guest?

594
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:35,116
Come on, Yubaba's still asleep.
Now's your chance.

595
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:37,451
I'm going to see Kamaji.

596
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:40,128
I wouldn't go there now.

597
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:42,506
He's angry because
they woke him up.

598
01:11:42,507 --> 01:11:44,550
Lin, let's go back for more.

599
01:12:09,534 --> 01:12:13,079
What if I can't
recognize my parents?

600
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:16,657
I hope Dad hasn't gotten too fat.

601
01:12:44,735 --> 01:12:46,437
That's the dragon I saw.

602
01:12:46,737 --> 01:12:48,439
It's coming this way.

603
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:52,493
Those aren't birds!

604
01:13:03,671 --> 01:13:07,000
Haku, don't give up. Over here!

605
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:09,676
Haku!

606
01:13:28,863 --> 01:13:30,235
It's just paper.

607
01:13:58,309 --> 01:14:00,682
Haku? It is you, isn't it?

608
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:10,070
Are you hurt? Those
paper birds are gone.

609
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:11,568
You're safe now.

610
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:26,495
He's going to Yubaba.

611
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:29,548
What should I do? He'll die!

612
01:14:37,014 --> 01:14:41,765
Now the richest man in
the whole wide world...

613
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:46,144
has come to grace us
with his presence.

614
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:49,025
Greetings!

615
01:14:49,026 --> 01:14:52,571
Now let us appeal
to his generosity.

616
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:54,903
Please, sir! Over here.

617
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,452
I hope I get some.

618
01:14:59,453 --> 01:15:01,655
They say gold springs
from his palms.

619
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:05,580
Toss some this way, sir!

620
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:10,880
What are you doing?

621
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:11,965
Going upstairs.

622
01:15:11,966 --> 01:15:14,214
No you don't. What's this?

623
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:16,171
Blood!

624
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:22,343
Out of the way, we have a guest.

625
01:15:23,728 --> 01:15:25,726
Thank you for your help.

626
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:28,519
Get out of the way!

627
01:15:50,254 --> 01:15:52,127
I don't need it.

628
01:15:54,842 --> 01:15:57,386
I'm busy, please excuse me.

629
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:11,893
Quiet! Quiet down.

630
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:14,232
Back, get back!

631
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:16,696
Please excuse her manners.

632
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:20,447
The girl is new and a human.

633
01:16:22,787 --> 01:16:25,581
What's so funny?
Wipe off that smile.

634
01:16:25,623 --> 01:16:27,166
Why, I would never...

635
01:16:31,879 --> 01:16:34,457
He ate them!

636
01:18:01,177 --> 01:18:02,629
Yubaba!

637
01:19:15,042 --> 01:19:18,121
We're in a fine mess now.

638
01:19:18,545 --> 01:19:20,797
He's a No Face.

639
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:22,966
That's right, a No Face!

640
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:26,174
Your greed attracted quite a guest.

641
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:29,924
Don't do anything stupid
until I get down there.

642
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:32,809
Just look at this carpet.

643
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:35,186
Get Haku out of here.

644
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:37,264
He's useless to me now.

645
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:02,840
Bo, sleeping outside
your crib again?

646
01:20:06,552 --> 01:20:10,847
Oh I'm sorry, you were sleeping
like such a good baby.

647
01:20:10,848 --> 01:20:13,972
Baba still has work to do.

648
01:20:16,687 --> 01:20:19,686
Go back to sleep now,
that's a good baby.

649
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:49,632
Ouch, let me go!

650
01:20:49,887 --> 01:20:51,846
Oh, thanks for helping me.

651
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:55,266
But I'm in a hurry,
please let me go.

652
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:57,811
You came to make me sick.

653
01:20:58,145 --> 01:21:00,939
The outside has bad germs.

654
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:05,687
I'm a human. Maybe you
never saw one before.

655
01:21:05,736 --> 01:21:08,154
You'll get sick out there.

656
01:21:08,155 --> 01:21:10,406
Stay here and play with me.

657
01:21:10,407 --> 01:21:12,075
Are you sick?

658
01:21:12,076 --> 01:21:15,036
I'm in here 'cause
I'll get sick outside.

659
01:21:15,037 --> 01:21:17,622
Staying inside will make you sick!

660
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:21,501
You see, someone I really
care about is badly hurt.

661
01:21:21,502 --> 01:21:23,252
I've got to go right now.

662
01:21:23,253 --> 01:21:24,830
Please let me go.

663
01:21:24,838 --> 01:21:30,134
If you go, I'll start crying.
Then Baba will come and kill you.

664
01:21:30,135 --> 01:21:31,969
I'll break your little arm.

665
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:33,262
You're hurting me!

666
01:21:33,263 --> 01:21:35,932
Please, I'll come
play with you later.

667
01:21:35,933 --> 01:21:37,726
No, I wanna play now!

668
01:21:41,522 --> 01:21:43,895
Blood! See? It's blood!

669
01:21:55,285 --> 01:21:56,987
Haku!

670
01:21:57,121 --> 01:21:59,330
Go away!

671
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:00,623
It's you, isn't it?

672
01:22:00,624 --> 01:22:02,167
Hang on!

673
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:03,501
Be quiet!

674
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:04,828
Haku!

675
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:11,593
Go away!

676
01:22:14,054 --> 01:22:15,597
No!

677
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:34,407
I'm not afraid of blood.
I'll cry if you don't play.

678
01:22:34,408 --> 01:22:36,451
Please be a good boy and wait.

679
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:39,868
If you don't play
with me I'll cry...

680
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:43,166
Please, wait!

681
01:22:43,167 --> 01:22:46,667
What a racket. Simmer down.

682
01:22:47,754 --> 01:22:50,377
You're a little
butterball, aren't you?

683
01:22:58,015 --> 01:23:00,349
I am a bit transparent here.

684
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:01,392
Baba...

685
01:23:01,852 --> 01:23:05,977
Oh dear, can't you even tell
me from your own mother?

686
01:23:14,114 --> 01:23:16,991
There, that gives you a
little more freedom.

687
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:20,492
Let's see now. What
shall we turn you into?

688
01:23:38,305 --> 01:23:41,140
This is our little secret.
If you tell anyone...

689
01:23:41,141 --> 01:23:43,389
I'll do the same to you.

690
01:23:44,728 --> 01:23:46,062
Who are you?

691
01:23:46,063 --> 01:23:48,564
Yubaba's older twin sister.

692
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:52,485
Thanks to you I've had
a nice tour of the place.

693
01:23:52,486 --> 01:23:54,654
Now hand over the dragon.

694
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:57,274
What are you going to do?
He needs help.

695
01:23:57,407 --> 01:24:00,701
That dragon's a thief.
He works for my sister.

696
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:03,829
He stole a valuable
seal from my house.

697
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:06,783
Haku would never do that.
He's too kind.

698
01:24:07,084 --> 01:24:10,753
All dragons are kind.
Kind and stupid...

699
01:24:10,754 --> 01:24:15,551
and eager to learn my
sister's magical ways.

700
01:24:15,759 --> 01:24:19,554
This boy will do anything
that greedy woman wants.

701
01:24:19,596 --> 01:24:21,806
Now step aside.

702
01:24:21,807 --> 01:24:24,433
It's too late for him anyway.

703
01:24:24,434 --> 01:24:27,687
The thing he stole had
a protection spell.

704
01:24:27,688 --> 01:24:30,016
Now the thief will die.

705
01:24:30,607 --> 01:24:32,480
No, don't!

706
01:24:39,783 --> 01:24:41,909
What are you up to now?

707
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:44,784
All right, that's enough.
Back to your room.

708
01:24:52,254 --> 01:24:54,502
Oh dear, that was careless...

709
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,383
Haku, no!

710
01:25:17,571 --> 01:25:18,988
Haku!

711
01:25:46,767 --> 01:25:48,517
What is this?

712
01:25:48,518 --> 01:25:50,186
Hold on there!

713
01:25:52,939 --> 01:25:54,436
Haku!

714
01:25:57,694 --> 01:25:59,487
Does it hurt?

715
01:26:02,908 --> 01:26:05,236
This is serious.

716
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,412
Haku, don't give up.

717
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:10,411
What can we do? He'll die!

718
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:13,542
Something inside him
is eating him up.

719
01:26:13,543 --> 01:26:14,752
Inside him?

720
01:26:14,753 --> 01:26:18,298
It's a strong spell.
There's nothing I can do.

721
01:26:18,382 --> 01:26:21,801
Haku, the river
guardian gave me this.

722
01:26:21,802 --> 01:26:24,175
Eat it, maybe it will help.

723
01:26:26,223 --> 01:26:28,676
Haku, open your mouth.

724
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:31,519
Please Haku, eat it.

725
01:26:33,063 --> 01:26:35,061
See, it's safe.

726
01:26:35,148 --> 01:26:37,442
Is it some kind of medicine?

727
01:26:37,484 --> 01:26:40,733
Open your mouth. You can do it.

728
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:46,200
That's it.

729
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:47,823
Swallow it.

730
01:27:06,012 --> 01:27:07,589
He spit something out. That's it!

731
01:27:20,110 --> 01:27:21,485
The seal!

732
01:27:21,486 --> 01:27:23,529
It's getting away.
There! Over there!

733
01:27:43,049 --> 01:27:45,923
Sen, we have to purge the spell.

734
01:27:49,890 --> 01:27:50,931
Begone!

735
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:53,931
Haku took this from
Yubaba's sister.

736
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:56,934
From Zeniba? That's a witch's seal.

737
01:27:57,147 --> 01:27:59,475
Precious loot, I'd say.

738
01:28:02,778 --> 01:28:03,903
I knew it was Haku.

739
01:28:03,904 --> 01:28:05,697
Kamaji, it's Haku!

740
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:08,824
Haku!

741
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:10,527
Haku, Haku!

742
01:28:12,662 --> 01:28:14,747
Kamaji, he's not breathing.

743
01:28:14,748 --> 01:28:18,543
He is, but he's still
very ill from the spell.

744
01:28:27,594 --> 01:28:30,798
That should calm him some.

745
01:28:33,016 --> 01:28:38,020
Haku turned up one
day, just like you.

746
01:28:38,021 --> 01:28:41,065
He said he wanted to learn magic.

747
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:43,275
I tried to warn him.

748
01:28:43,276 --> 01:28:47,151
Becoming a sorcerer's apprentice
is dangerous business.

749
01:28:47,447 --> 01:28:50,070
But he wouldn't listen.
He kept saying...

750
01:28:50,116 --> 01:28:51,867
that he'd lost his home.

751
01:28:51,868 --> 01:28:55,618
So he signed up to be
Yubaba's apprentice.

752
01:28:55,872 --> 01:28:59,124
He got paler and paler
as time went by...

753
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:02,249
and got a sharp gleam in his eye.

754
01:29:04,089 --> 01:29:08,217
Kamaji, I'm going to give
this back to Zeniba.

755
01:29:08,218 --> 01:29:12,054
Give it back, apologize,
and ask her to help Haku.

756
01:29:12,055 --> 01:29:14,178
Tell me how to get there.

757
01:29:14,391 --> 01:29:16,935
To Zeniba's house?

758
01:29:17,143 --> 01:29:19,186
That's one scary sorceress.

759
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:20,183
Please.

760
01:29:20,230 --> 01:29:24,435
Haku helped me. Now
I want to help him.

761
01:29:25,944 --> 01:29:29,238
Well, getting there is one thing.

762
01:29:29,239 --> 01:29:31,362
Getting back's the problem.

763
01:29:31,491 --> 01:29:33,443
Wait a minute.

764
01:29:35,662 --> 01:29:39,207
Let's see now, they're
here somewhere...

765
01:29:39,666 --> 01:29:42,961
Everyone, I need my
shoes and clothes.

766
01:29:51,094 --> 01:29:54,298
Sen! I've been hunting
for you everywhere!

767
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:57,892
Lin...

768
01:29:57,893 --> 01:30:00,767
Haku? What happened here?

769
01:30:01,271 --> 01:30:02,472
Who are those guys?

770
01:30:03,356 --> 01:30:04,940
My new friends.

771
01:30:04,941 --> 01:30:05,858
Right?

772
01:30:05,901 --> 01:30:09,275
Yubaba's looking for you.
She's hopping mad.

773
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:13,109
That big tipper turned
out to be a No Face.

774
01:30:13,366 --> 01:30:15,989
Yubaba says you let him in.

775
01:30:19,205 --> 01:30:20,581
She might be right.

776
01:30:20,582 --> 01:30:22,791
What, are you serious?

777
01:30:22,792 --> 01:30:24,543
I thought he was a customer.

778
01:30:24,544 --> 01:30:27,918
He's already swallowed
three of our people!

779
01:30:28,131 --> 01:30:31,335
Found them. Here they are, Sen.

780
01:30:31,551 --> 01:30:33,302
We're busy, gramps.

781
01:30:33,303 --> 01:30:35,096
You can use these.

782
01:30:36,306 --> 01:30:39,224
Train tickets? Where'd
you get those?

783
01:30:39,225 --> 01:30:41,810
Leftovers from 40 years ago.

784
01:30:41,811 --> 01:30:45,766
You get off at the sixth
stop, called Swamp Bottom.

785
01:30:45,815 --> 01:30:47,024
Swamp Bottom?

786
01:30:47,025 --> 01:30:49,068
That's right, the sixth stop.

787
01:30:49,069 --> 01:30:50,270
Six.

788
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:54,156
Make sure you get it right.
There used to be a return train...

789
01:30:54,157 --> 01:30:56,158
but these days it's one way only.

790
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:57,952
Still want to go?

791
01:30:57,953 --> 01:31:01,373
Yes, I'll walk back
along the tracks.

792
01:31:02,874 --> 01:31:04,750
What about Yubaba?

793
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:06,203
I'll talk to her now.

794
01:31:06,836 --> 01:31:10,836
Haku, I promise I'll be back.
Please don't die.

795
01:31:11,257 --> 01:31:13,130
What's going on here?

796
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:16,179
Don't you understand? It's love.

797
01:31:23,853 --> 01:31:26,355
It just keeps getting bigger!

798
01:31:26,356 --> 01:31:29,184
- Don't let it eat me!
- Here she comes.

799
01:31:36,533 --> 01:31:38,117
Thank goodness, Sen!

800
01:31:38,118 --> 01:31:40,537
Yubaba can't control him.

801
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:47,586
There's no need to get upset.
Sen will be here soon.

802
01:31:47,794 --> 01:31:50,497
Where's Sen? I want Sen!

803
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:52,457
Now hurry!

804
01:31:57,595 --> 01:31:59,638
Yubaba, it's Sen.

805
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:01,140
Where were you?

806
01:32:01,141 --> 01:32:05,767
Sen is here, honored guest.
She'll be right with you.

807
01:32:06,604 --> 01:32:09,898
What took you so long?
This is a total disaster!

808
01:32:09,899 --> 01:32:12,943
Win him over and take all his gold.

809
01:32:16,614 --> 01:32:19,158
What's this filthy rat?

810
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:23,363
Don't you recognize him?

811
01:32:23,413 --> 01:32:26,366
Of course not. How disgusting.

812
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:27,951
Now in you go.

813
01:32:29,252 --> 01:32:31,705
Have a nice time.

814
01:32:32,422 --> 01:32:34,875
Will she be all right?

815
01:32:34,924 --> 01:32:36,967
Want to take her place?

816
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:00,654
Try this, it's yummy.

817
01:33:02,327 --> 01:33:07,033
Want some gold? I've
decided it's just for you.

818
01:33:10,835 --> 01:33:12,711
Come over here.

819
01:33:12,712 --> 01:33:16,542
What do you want? You can tell me.

820
01:33:16,674 --> 01:33:18,717
Where did you come from?

821
01:33:18,718 --> 01:33:21,296
There's someplace I
have to go right away.

822
01:33:23,473 --> 01:33:26,141
You should go home.

823
01:33:26,142 --> 01:33:29,312
You can't give me what I want.

824
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:34,184
Where's your home? You
must have a mom and dad.

825
01:33:34,818 --> 01:33:38,318
No... No...

826
01:33:39,072 --> 01:33:43,027
I'm lonely... So lonely...

827
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:45,362
Are you lost?

828
01:33:45,537 --> 01:33:49,287
Sen... I want Sen.

829
01:33:49,707 --> 01:33:51,033
Take the gold.

830
01:33:51,376 --> 01:33:52,668
Would you eat me?

831
01:33:52,669 --> 01:33:53,585
Take it.

832
01:33:53,586 --> 01:33:54,662
Take it!

833
01:34:03,721 --> 01:34:06,640
Before you eat me, eat this first.

834
01:34:07,225 --> 01:34:11,271
I was saving it for my
parents, but you can have it.

835
01:34:31,875 --> 01:34:33,497
Sen!

836
01:34:35,753 --> 01:34:39,708
You little wench!
What did you feed me?

837
01:34:54,772 --> 01:34:56,315
Watch out!

838
01:34:57,275 --> 01:34:59,318
Not in my house!

839
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:14,162
I'm over here!

840
01:35:14,751 --> 01:35:16,294
Here!

841
01:36:00,838 --> 01:36:02,711
You'll pay for this!

842
01:36:19,983 --> 01:36:22,231
Sen, down here!

843
01:36:38,376 --> 01:36:40,752
Over here!

844
01:36:40,753 --> 01:36:42,626
We don't need him.

845
01:36:46,426 --> 01:36:50,053
He needs to get out of there.
It's bad for him.

846
01:36:50,054 --> 01:36:52,347
But where do we take him?

847
01:36:52,348 --> 01:36:53,432
I don't know.

848
01:36:53,433 --> 01:36:55,055
Don't know?

849
01:36:55,310 --> 01:36:58,138
Great, now he's following us.

850
01:37:15,455 --> 01:37:17,664
- From here you walk.
- Okay.

851
01:37:17,665 --> 01:37:19,541
You'll find the station.

852
01:37:19,542 --> 01:37:21,164
Thanks.

853
01:37:21,586 --> 01:37:23,413
Be sure to come back!

854
01:37:23,421 --> 01:37:24,622
I will.

855
01:37:28,593 --> 01:37:32,220
Sen! I said you were a klutz.

856
01:37:32,221 --> 01:37:33,923
I take it back!

857
01:37:41,939 --> 01:37:46,315
No Face, hurt her and
you'll get it from me!

858
01:37:49,405 --> 01:37:50,948
There it is.

859
01:38:02,293 --> 01:38:04,871
The train's coming, let's hurry.

860
01:38:28,152 --> 01:38:30,605
To Swamp Bottom, please.

861
01:38:36,994 --> 01:38:38,867
You want to come too?

862
01:38:40,164 --> 01:38:42,366
One more, please.

863
01:39:22,707 --> 01:39:24,250
Sit down.

864
01:39:24,667 --> 01:39:26,540
Behave yourself, okay?

865
01:41:28,499 --> 01:41:30,167
Kamaji.

866
01:41:32,336 --> 01:41:35,046
Oh, Haku. You're awake.

867
01:41:35,047 --> 01:41:36,794
Kamaji, where's Sen?

868
01:41:37,008 --> 01:41:39,802
What happened? Please tell me.

869
01:41:39,844 --> 01:41:42,923
Don't you remember anything?

870
01:41:43,306 --> 01:41:45,599
Just fragments.

871
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:48,895
Chihiro kept calling my
name in the darkness.

872
01:41:48,978 --> 01:41:53,183
I followed her voice
and woke up here.

873
01:41:53,357 --> 01:41:58,438
Chihiro? So her name is Chihiro.

874
01:41:59,488 --> 01:42:02,567
Wonderful...
It's the power of love.

875
01:42:06,037 --> 01:42:09,247
This gold will hardly
cover the damage.

876
01:42:09,248 --> 01:42:12,372
That fool, Sen! She
just cost me a fortune.

877
01:42:12,668 --> 01:42:16,504
But we were saved, thanks to her.

878
01:42:16,505 --> 01:42:17,756
Silence!

879
01:42:17,757 --> 01:42:20,300
She started the whole thing.

880
01:42:20,301 --> 01:42:22,719
Now she's run away.

881
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:25,594
Abandoned her own parents!

882
01:42:26,057 --> 01:42:30,103
They must be fat enough.
Turn them into bacon or ham.

883
01:42:30,227 --> 01:42:32,054
No, wait.

884
01:42:33,022 --> 01:42:34,272
Master Haku!

885
01:42:34,273 --> 01:42:36,726
What, you're still alive?

886
01:42:38,903 --> 01:42:42,482
You still don't see it?
She's played a trick on you.

887
01:42:42,740 --> 01:42:45,700
You've gotten pretty fresh.

888
01:42:45,701 --> 01:42:48,370
Since when do you talk that way?

889
01:43:39,797 --> 01:43:41,965
Bo?

890
01:43:47,763 --> 01:43:49,514
Bo!

891
01:43:49,515 --> 01:43:50,640
Pebbles!

892
01:43:50,641 --> 01:43:53,640
Bo!

893
01:43:53,936 --> 01:43:57,982
Where are you, Bo?

894
01:43:58,107 --> 01:44:00,935
Please come out.

895
01:44:01,444 --> 01:44:02,941
Bo!

896
01:44:05,990 --> 01:44:08,488
Bo?

897
01:44:13,122 --> 01:44:17,668
Why, you little...

898
01:44:18,919 --> 01:44:22,248
Out with it!

899
01:44:23,507 --> 01:44:27,837
Where did you hide my Bo?

900
01:44:28,137 --> 01:44:30,054
He's with Zeniba.

901
01:44:30,055 --> 01:44:32,223
Zeniba?

902
01:44:53,037 --> 01:44:56,831
Now I understand. That evil witch.

903
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:59,751
She thinks she's beaten me.

904
01:45:01,212 --> 01:45:03,665
So, what's your plan?

905
01:45:03,964 --> 01:45:06,174
I'll bring him back.

906
01:45:06,175 --> 01:45:10,553
But you must send Sen and her
parents back to their world.

907
01:45:10,554 --> 01:45:13,177
And what about you?

908
01:45:13,224 --> 01:45:17,179
Maybe I'll send them back and
then tear you to pieces.

909
01:46:03,941 --> 01:46:05,768
I think this is right.

910
01:46:06,735 --> 01:46:08,232
Come on.

911
01:46:34,847 --> 01:46:36,720
You can ride on my shoulder.

912
01:47:55,177 --> 01:47:56,799
Come in.

913
01:48:01,767 --> 01:48:03,765
Thank you.

914
01:48:05,521 --> 01:48:08,144
Well, hurry up then.

915
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:09,937
Come on.

916
01:48:13,028 --> 01:48:14,988
So you all made it.

917
01:48:14,989 --> 01:48:17,532
- I...
- Have a seat.

918
01:48:17,533 --> 01:48:19,986
I'll make some tea.

919
01:48:25,624 --> 01:48:30,079
Zeniba, Haku stole this.
I came to give it back.

920
01:48:33,132 --> 01:48:35,801
Do you know what this is?

921
01:48:35,884 --> 01:48:38,928
No, but I know it's very precious.

922
01:48:38,929 --> 01:48:42,759
I'm here to apologize
for him. He's sorry.

923
01:48:43,434 --> 01:48:46,602
You held this and nothing
happened to you?

924
01:48:46,603 --> 01:48:47,645
What?

925
01:48:47,646 --> 01:48:50,645
Wait, the protection spell is gone.

926
01:48:51,567 --> 01:48:54,861
I'm sorry. There was
this strange bug.

927
01:48:54,862 --> 01:48:56,905
I squashed it.

928
01:48:57,239 --> 01:48:59,567
Squashed it!

929
01:49:01,410 --> 01:49:04,871
My sister snuck that
bug into the dragon...

930
01:49:04,872 --> 01:49:07,665
so she could control him.

931
01:49:07,666 --> 01:49:10,494
And you squashed it!

932
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:14,797
Now then, sit down.

933
01:49:14,798 --> 01:49:18,002
You must be No Face. You sit, too.

934
01:49:18,761 --> 01:49:22,555
Please turn them back
into themselves.

935
01:49:22,556 --> 01:49:25,767
Why my dear,
the spell's long broken.

936
01:49:25,768 --> 01:49:28,346
They can change back any time.

937
01:49:35,444 --> 01:49:39,405
Yubaba and I are two halves of a
whole, but we don't get along.

938
01:49:39,406 --> 01:49:42,116
You know what bad taste she has.

939
01:49:42,117 --> 01:49:45,366
Sorceress twins are just
a recipe for trouble.

940
01:49:49,208 --> 01:49:53,795
I'd like to help you dear, but
there's nothing I can do.

941
01:49:53,796 --> 01:49:56,044
It's one of our rules here.

942
01:49:56,298 --> 01:49:59,425
You'll have to save your parents
and your dragon boyfriend...

943
01:49:59,426 --> 01:50:01,177
all by yourself.

944
01:50:01,178 --> 01:50:04,302
But can't you even give me a hint?

945
01:50:04,473 --> 01:50:08,101
I feel like Haku and I
met a long time ago.

946
01:50:08,102 --> 01:50:10,304
In that case it's easy.

947
01:50:10,395 --> 01:50:13,064
Everything that happens
stays inside you...

948
01:50:13,065 --> 01:50:15,518
even if you can't remember it.

949
01:50:16,652 --> 01:50:20,197
It's already late. Why
don't you stay the night?

950
01:50:20,405 --> 01:50:23,404
You boys give me a hand.

951
01:50:29,331 --> 01:50:31,533
Come on, keep at it.

952
01:50:34,336 --> 01:50:37,004
See? You have a talent for this.

953
01:50:37,005 --> 01:50:38,832
You're a big help.

954
01:50:39,424 --> 01:50:42,878
It's not the same
when you use magic.

955
01:50:44,012 --> 01:50:48,558
Pull it through there.
Now do it again.

956
01:50:48,559 --> 01:50:51,387
Zeniba, I'm going back after all.

957
01:50:51,854 --> 01:50:55,523
Haku could die while
I'm sitting here.

958
01:50:55,524 --> 01:50:59,228
And they might eat my mom and dad!

959
01:51:01,196 --> 01:51:04,073
Wait just a little longer.

960
01:51:04,074 --> 01:51:05,821
There we are.

961
01:51:06,451 --> 01:51:08,619
Use it to tie back your hair.

962
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:14,701
It's pretty.

963
01:51:14,710 --> 01:51:19,837
It'll protect you. I made
it from the thread we spun.

964
01:51:19,882 --> 01:51:21,379
Thank you.

965
01:51:30,726 --> 01:51:34,645
What good timing. We've got
another guest, let him in.

966
01:51:34,646 --> 01:51:35,972
Sure.

967
01:51:49,077 --> 01:51:50,403
Haku!

968
01:51:51,413 --> 01:51:52,785
Haku...

969
01:51:53,415 --> 01:51:55,208
I'm so glad to see you.

970
01:51:55,334 --> 01:51:58,003
Are you okay?
Do you feel all right?

971
01:51:58,086 --> 01:51:59,287
Thank goodness.

972
01:52:00,923 --> 01:52:03,376
Good timing, I'd say.

973
01:52:03,842 --> 01:52:06,511
Zeniba, Haku's alive.

974
01:52:06,845 --> 01:52:11,098
Haku, I no longer blame
you for what you did.

975
01:52:11,099 --> 01:52:14,678
But be sure to protect this girl.

976
01:52:14,770 --> 01:52:17,897
Okay boys, time you went home.

977
01:52:17,898 --> 01:52:20,146
Come see me again soon.

978
01:52:20,692 --> 01:52:25,238
You stay with me and be my helper.

979
01:52:27,532 --> 01:52:28,699
Zeniba!

980
01:52:29,117 --> 01:52:31,410
Thank you, I'm going now.

981
01:52:31,411 --> 01:52:34,622
Don't worry, I'm sure
you'll manage just fine.

982
01:52:34,623 --> 01:52:37,959
My real name is Chihiro.

983
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:40,586
Chihiro? What a nice name.

984
01:52:40,587 --> 01:52:42,588
Take good care of it.

985
01:52:42,589 --> 01:52:43,381
I will!

986
01:52:43,382 --> 01:52:45,380
Now off you go.

987
01:52:46,885 --> 01:52:50,180
Thank you, Zeniba. Goodbye!

988
01:53:39,021 --> 01:53:40,723
Haku, listen.

989
01:53:40,856 --> 01:53:44,686
I don't remember this, but
my mom told me about it.

990
01:53:44,860 --> 01:53:48,690
Once when I was little,
I fell in a river.

991
01:53:48,947 --> 01:53:52,777
Now it's all built over.
It flows underground.

992
01:53:52,951 --> 01:53:55,279
But I just remembered.

993
01:53:56,204 --> 01:53:58,077
The river was called...

994
01:53:58,540 --> 01:54:01,619
it was called the Kohaku River.

995
01:54:02,044 --> 01:54:05,248
Your real name is Kohaku.

996
01:54:26,651 --> 01:54:28,235
Chihiro, thank you!

997
01:54:28,236 --> 01:54:31,690
My name is Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.

998
01:54:31,907 --> 01:54:35,284
- Nigihayami?
- Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.

999
01:54:35,285 --> 01:54:38,204
What a name! Sounds
like a guardian spirit.

1000
01:54:38,330 --> 01:54:42,875
I remember how you fell
into me as a child.

1001
01:54:42,876 --> 01:54:44,794
You were chasing your shoe.

1002
01:54:44,795 --> 01:54:49,341
Yes, and you carried
me to shallow water.

1003
01:54:50,008 --> 01:54:51,460
I'm so happy...

1004
01:55:24,042 --> 01:55:25,664
They're back!

1005
01:55:38,807 --> 01:55:41,635
You brought Bo back with you?

1006
01:55:44,312 --> 01:55:45,354
Baba!

1007
01:55:45,355 --> 01:55:49,981
Bo! You're not hurt? What
a terrible time you had.

1008
01:55:51,027 --> 01:55:54,356
Bo, when did you learn
to stand on your own?

1009
01:55:54,739 --> 01:55:56,862
Yubaba, remember your promise.

1010
01:55:56,908 --> 01:56:00,112
Send Chihiro and her parents
back to their world.

1011
01:56:00,328 --> 01:56:02,872
Sorry, but it's not that simple.

1012
01:56:02,873 --> 01:56:06,202
This world has rules, you know.

1013
01:56:06,626 --> 01:56:07,918
Silence!

1014
01:56:07,919 --> 01:56:10,747
Just do it, Baba. Don't be so mean.

1015
01:56:10,839 --> 01:56:13,633
Baby had such a good time.

1016
01:56:13,925 --> 01:56:16,802
But I'm just following the rule.

1017
01:56:16,803 --> 01:56:19,381
Otherwise I can't break the spell.

1018
01:56:19,431 --> 01:56:22,760
If you make Sen cry,
I won't like you anymore.

1019
01:56:22,851 --> 01:56:24,310
But...

1020
01:56:24,311 --> 01:56:25,683
Granny!

1021
01:56:25,687 --> 01:56:27,264
Granny?

1022
01:56:27,397 --> 01:56:29,224
I'll do as you ask.

1023
01:56:40,869 --> 01:56:43,120
Haku told me about the rule.

1024
01:56:43,121 --> 01:56:45,119
Well, you've got guts.

1025
01:56:45,123 --> 01:56:48,542
I brought your contract. Follow me.

1026
01:56:48,543 --> 01:56:50,791
This won't take a minute, Bo.

1027
01:56:51,588 --> 01:56:53,290
Don't worry.

1028
01:56:57,552 --> 01:57:01,598
See if you can pick out
your parents for me.

1029
01:57:10,732 --> 01:57:12,274
You get one guess.

1030
01:57:12,275 --> 01:57:15,149
Pick them out and you all go free.

1031
01:57:26,790 --> 01:57:30,626
Granny, I can't do it.
Dad and Mom aren't here.

1032
01:57:30,627 --> 01:57:34,422
Not here? Is that your answer?

1033
01:57:35,757 --> 01:57:37,004
Yes.

1034
01:57:39,594 --> 01:57:43,055
You're right!

1035
01:57:43,056 --> 01:57:45,725
Attagirl! Good for you.

1036
01:57:49,479 --> 01:57:50,771
Thank you everyone.

1037
01:57:50,772 --> 01:57:54,226
All right! You win,
just get out of here.

1038
01:57:54,526 --> 01:57:56,649
Thanks for everything.

1039
01:57:56,987 --> 01:57:58,689
Goodbye.

1040
01:57:58,947 --> 01:58:00,114
Thank you.

1041
01:58:00,115 --> 01:58:01,692
See you soon.

1042
01:58:01,783 --> 01:58:03,735
- Haku!
- Let's go.

1043
01:58:04,202 --> 01:58:05,536
Where's Mom and Dad?

1044
01:58:05,537 --> 01:58:07,034
They went on ahead.

1045
01:58:14,379 --> 01:58:15,629
The water's gone.

1046
01:58:15,630 --> 01:58:17,582
I can't go any further.

1047
01:58:17,799 --> 01:58:20,301
Go back the way you came.

1048
01:58:20,302 --> 01:58:23,554
But don't look back until
you're out of the tunnel.

1049
01:58:23,555 --> 01:58:25,849
But what about you?

1050
01:58:26,057 --> 01:58:28,976
I'll tell Yubaba I'm
quitting my apprenticeship.

1051
01:58:28,977 --> 01:58:31,726
I'm fine now. I have my name back.

1052
01:58:32,063 --> 01:58:33,981
Now I can go home too.

1053
01:58:33,982 --> 01:58:35,482
Will we meet again somewhere?

1054
01:58:35,483 --> 01:58:37,109
- I'm sure of it.
- Promise?

1055
01:58:37,110 --> 01:58:38,068
Promise.

1056
01:58:38,069 --> 01:58:40,567
Now go, and don't look back.

1057
01:59:03,428 --> 01:59:05,221
Chihiro!

1058
01:59:05,347 --> 01:59:08,221
Where have you been? Hurry up.

1059
01:59:11,519 --> 01:59:13,479
Mom! Dad!

1060
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:15,356
Don't go running off like that.

1061
01:59:15,357 --> 01:59:16,558
Let's go.

1062
01:59:17,025 --> 01:59:19,360
Mom, are you really okay?

1063
01:59:19,361 --> 01:59:23,816
Hurry, the moving
van will be there.

1064
01:59:33,041 --> 01:59:35,460
Hurry up, Chihiro.

1065
01:59:43,968 --> 01:59:45,844
Watch your step.

1066
01:59:45,845 --> 01:59:49,390
Chihiro, don't cling.
You'll make me trip.

1067
02:00:01,403 --> 02:00:03,071
The end of the tunnel.

1068
02:00:03,238 --> 02:00:04,690
Hey!

1069
02:00:04,823 --> 02:00:06,400
What is it?

1070
02:00:06,783 --> 02:00:09,111
Will you look at that.

1071
02:00:09,994 --> 02:00:12,367
It's all dusty inside, too.

1072
02:00:12,580 --> 02:00:14,623
- Is this somebody's joke?
- I wonder...

1073
02:00:14,624 --> 02:00:17,247
I told you not to stop here.

1074
02:00:22,757 --> 02:00:25,460
That's it, you're fine.

1075
02:00:26,511 --> 02:00:28,887
We're off, Chihiro.

1076
02:00:28,888 --> 02:00:31,807
Chihiro! Hurry up!
