Hey, Ash, where are we?

15
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,784
Well, we just crossed
the Tennessee border.

16
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,843
- Which would put us...
- Yeah?

17
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,346
Which would put us...

18
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,894
"fight"

19
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,731
- here.
- (Tires screeching)

20
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,066
(Honking)

21
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,730
Turn!

22
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,900
- (Horn blaring)
- (Screaming)

23
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,568
(Sighs)

24
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,707
What the hell was that? Are
you trying to kill us?

25
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,827
Hey, don't blame me. It's
your steering wheel.

26
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,681
The damn thing jerked
right out of my hand.

27
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:08,711
I can't understand it.

28
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,523
I had this thing in for
a tune-up yesterday

29
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,107
and they said they'd
go over everything.

30
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:14,402
You'd better take it back 'cause
the damn thing don't work.

31
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,346
The only thing that does
work is this lousy horn.

32
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:20,467
(Honking)

33
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,928
Aw, go to hell! I'm
not honking at you.

34
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,807
Jesus Christ.

35
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,222
Woman: Hey, Scotty, what's
this place like anyway?

36
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,392
Well, the guy that's renting
it says it's an old place...

37
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,564
A little rundown, but it's
right up in the mountains.

38
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,652
And the best part is
we get it so cheap.

39
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,863
Yeah, why are we
getting it so cheap?

40
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:45,029
Well, I don't know. Might
be in real bad shape.

41
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,699
You mean nobody's
seen this place yet?

42
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:48,876
Scott: Well, not yet.

43
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:52,082
- Well, it might not be that bad.
- No.

44
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:55,293
- Actually, it might be kinda nice.
- Yeah.

45
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,424
It's probably a real pit.

46
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,199
Hey, I think this is
where we get off.

47
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,551
Woman: This is the bridge
we're gonna cross?

48
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:11,267
Scott: Jesus Christ, the whole
thing's falling apart on us.

49
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,352
Ash: Don't let the
noise fool you, girls.

50
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:14,983
This thing is solid as a rock.

51
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,144
(Woman screams)

52
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,783
(Scott laughing)

53
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,951
(Distant thumping)

54
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:21,543
(Thumping grows louder)

55
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,009
(Thumping)

56
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,065
(Thumping stops)

57
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,197
It's supposed to be
one of these on here.

58
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:54,097
(Creaking)

59
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,468
- Come on.
- Hey.

60
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,923
Hey hey.

61
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,758
- Huh!
- (Laughs)

62
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,522
(Crickets chirping)

63
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,284
(Ticking)

64
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,917
(Chimes)

65
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:55,090
(Chiming)

66
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,934
- Demon: Join us.
- (Banging)

67
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,977
Join us.

68
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,294
(Whimpering)

69
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,079
(Banging)

70
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,678
(Grinding)

71
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,012
(Whispering) Dead
bodies in the cellar.

72
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,648
- Dead bodies in the cellar.
- Will you stop it?

73
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,900
I would like very much
to make a toast here

74
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,778
for all this evening.

75
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,359
"That sounds a" right.

76
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:40,152
Uh, as a Greek friend
of mine once said...

77
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:44,198
He said, "...I'"

78
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,584
- (Woman giggles)
- Ash: No, okay okay okay.

79
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,745
"Nis nis..."

80
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,665
tu tu tu...

81
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,549
"tu-tar-im."

82
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:58,212
- Woman: Which means?
- "Party down!" Yeah!

83
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:01,261
(Clangs)

84
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:12,230
(Water dripping)

85
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,991
What is this?

86
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:26,122
Whatever it is, it's
still down there.

87
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:30,126
I don't like cellars.
Let's just close it up.

88
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,913
It's probably just some animal.

89
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:37,176
An animal? An animal.

90
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,632
That is the stupidest
thing I ever heard of.

91
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,467
Jesus Christ.

92
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,349
Well, there's
something down there.

93
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,474
Well, maybe it is
just some animal.

94
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,889
Yeah, you're probably right.

95
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,899
It's probably just some animal.

96
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,256
Here, Cheryl. Why don't you go
down and check to make sure?

97
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,396
Scotty, I'm not
going down there.

98
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:00,657
Okay okay, you cowards. I'll go.

99
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,864
Be careful.

100
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,491
Back in a minute.

101
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,100
(Water dripping)

102
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,891
Hey... hey, Scotty,
you find anything?

103
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,435
Scotty?

104
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,446
Scotty?

105
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,039
<i>Scot“</i>

106
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,041
He's just kidding around.

107
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,922
- Isn't he?
- Scotty!

108
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,212
<i>Scot“</i>

109
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,846
Linda, get me a flashlight.

110
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,678
That's the only one
we brought up.

111
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:08,933
Then get the lantern.

112
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:36,833
(Water dripping)

113
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,260
Scotty?

114
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,280
(Wood clatters)

115
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,769
(Creaking)

116
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,793
Boo! (Laughing)

117
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,887
Hey, come here. I want
to show you something.

118
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,222
Look at all this stuff.

119
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,433
(Clicks)

120
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,530
(Clicks)

121
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,937
I bet this still shoots.

122
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,483
Probably does.

123
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,150
Oh! God.

124
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,628
Oh God.

125
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,709
Look at this.

126
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,727
Look at this.

127
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,112
This kind of looks like
your old girlfriend.

128
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,249
Come on, let's take
this stuff upstairs.

129
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,084
I'll grab the recorder and
you get everything else.

130
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:18,977
(Thunderclaps)

131
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,931
Scott: This guy was a
real turd, you know?

132
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,846
Everybody hated him.

133
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,264
Like you kind of, right?

134
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,854
Yeah, just like me. I'm
gonna break your face.

135
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:29,736
Scott: Also, he was into
this Western stuff.

136
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,306
He makes all these
little models...

137
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,360
Okay, shh.

138
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,276
Listen to this.

139
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,240
This is the tape I
found downstairs.

140
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,246
(Thunder rumbling)

141
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,032
Man: It has been a
number of years

142
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:45,373
since I began excavating
the ruins of Ca'n Dar

143
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,503
with a group of my colleagues.

144
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,415
Now my wife and I have
retreated to a small cabin

145
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:53,130
in the solitude of
these mountains.

146
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,841
Here I continued my
research undisturbed

147
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,178
by the myriad distractions
of modern civilization

148
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:02,265
and far from the
groves of Academe.

149
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,305
I believe I have made
a significant find

150
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,349
in the Ca'n Darian ruins:

151
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,269
a volume of ancient
Sumerian burial practices

152
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,938
and funerary incantations.

153
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:16,107
It is entitled
"Naturan Demanto.“"

154
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,118
Roughly translated...
"Book of the Dead."

155
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,949
The book is bound in human flesh

156
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,706
and inked in human blood.

157
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,913
(Thunderclap)

158
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:29,330
It deals with demons,
demon resurrection

159
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,373
and those forces which
roam the forest

160
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,258
and dark bowers of man's domain.

161
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,839
- (Thunderclap)
- The first few pages

162
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,970
warn that these
enduring creatures

163
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,508
may lie dormant but
are never truly dead.

164
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,723
They may be recalled
to active life

165
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,513
through the incantations
presented in this book.

166
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,353
It is through recitation
of these passages

167
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:53,020
that the demons are given
license to possess the living.

168
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,904
(Thunder booming)

169
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,194
Hey, what'd you do that for?
It was just getting good.

170
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,034
I just don't wanna hear
it anymore, that's all.

171
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:03,367
(Eerie vocals)

172
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,953
Ash: Scott, come on.
Leave her alone, man.

173
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,835
Hey, come on. I just wanna
hear the rest of it.

174
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,167
No big deal.

175
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,675
(Man chanting in Sumerian)

176
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,803
(Sumerian continues)

177
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,760
(Sumerian continues)

178
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,515
Kanda.

179
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:33,060
Shut it off.

180
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,774
Kanda.

181
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,734
Shut it off!

182
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,325
- Shut it off!
- (Thunder booms)

183
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,283
- (Screams)
- Oh my God!

184
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,955
- (Crying)
- Cheryl.

185
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,166
- Where are you going?
- I can't believe this.

186
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,627
Scott, you knew
not to play that.

187
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,640
I mean, come on, you knew
it was upsetting her.

188
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,864
You just don't know when you're
taking something too far.

189
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,782
Hey, don't give me that.
You were playing it too.

190
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,296
You could have shut it off.

191
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:06,013
I mean, big deal. She's nuts.

192
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:07,518
I mean, it's just a joke.

193
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,395
- Come on.
- (Glass shatters)

194
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,978
Jesus Christ, she acts like she's
three years old or something.

195
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,026
(Thunder booming)

196
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:30,867
Listen, why don't we stay up for
a while and listen to the storm?

197
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,535
All right, yeah.

198
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,954
But let me check on Cheryl
first to make sure she's okay.

199
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,497
Okay.

200
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:44,657
Oh, stealing from
the blind, huh?

201
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,490
It's for you.

202
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,630
Ash, how sweet of you.

203
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,343
- Would you put it on?
- Oh sure.

204
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,873
I was gonna give it to you
before we came up here,

205
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:15,730
but things got so hectic.

206
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,609
This is really the first
chance we've had to be alone.

207
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,151
Take a look.

208
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:31,662
Oh, Ash, it's beautiful.

209
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,448
I really love it.

210
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,742
I'll never take it off.

211
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:49,172
(Demonic voices)

212
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,995
(Demonic growling)

213
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:35,184
Demon: Join us.

214
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,013
Is anybody out there?

215
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:17,677
(Wolf howling)

216
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,740
I know someone's out there.

217
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:27,164
I heard you. I heard
you in the cellar.

218
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:32,218
(Fluttering, screeching)

219
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:35,380

(Growling continues)

221
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:43,430
(Growling intensifies)

222
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,268
(Screams)

223
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:06,911
Demons: Join us.

224
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:21,055
(Screaming)

225
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:31,360
(Grunting, screaming)

226
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:43,425
(Screaming)

227
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,685
(Whimpering, grunting)

228
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:06,739
- (Trees cracking)
- (Ghostly howling)

229
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:19,086
(Whimpering, screaming)

230
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:23,965
(Cries out)

231
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,642
(Screaming)

232
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:35,067
Help! (Screaming)

233
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:34,293
Ashley!

234
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:42,259
Help!

235
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:43,919
Oh, the keys.

236
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:49,304
(Grunting)

237
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,903
Help!

238
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,088
(Screams)

239
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,554
(Demons shouting)

240
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,584
Ash: What the hell happened to you?
What's the matter with you?

241
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,248
Did something in the
woods do this to you?

242
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,439
No, it was the woods themselves.

243
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,478
They're alive, Ashley.

244
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:44,397
The trees, they're alive.

245
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:47,054
Ash, why don't I take her in the
back room so she can lie down?

246
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,951
I'm not lying down!

247
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,577
I wanna get out of here.

248
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,738
I wanna leave this
place right now.

249
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,782
- Right now, Ashley.
- Scott: Wait a minute.

250
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,871
I sure as hell am not
leaving anyplace tonight.

251
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,331
- Cheryl.
- Cheryl.

252
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,865
Look, there's nothing out there.
Trees do not attack people.

253
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,336
Ashley, will you drive
me into town or not?

254
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,342
What, right now?

255
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,352
Yeah. Look, sure sure,
I'll take you into town,

256
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,992
but just listen to
what you're saying.

257
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:10,632
I don't care how it sounds.

258
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,597
I wanna get out of
this place right now.

259
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:17,638
Okay, you can stay
somewhere in town tonight.

260
00:30:56,772 --> 00:31:00,640
(Engine chugging)

261
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,684
Come on, come on, come on.

262
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:08,948
(Engine chugging)

263
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:11,734
(Sighs)

264
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:17,157
(Engine chugging)

(Engine chugging)

266
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:27,299
(Engine chugging)

267
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:30,086
I know it's not gonna start.
It's not gonna let us leave.

268
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:32,345
(Engine starts)

269
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:25,478
(Wood creaking)

270
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,485
Why are you stopping?

271
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,770
Wait here a minute.

272
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,985
(Creaking continues)

273
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:43,117
Do you see something?

274
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,456
Where are you going?

275
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,715
Ashley?

276
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,974
Ashley?

277
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,992
Oh oh!

278
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:05,916
(Screaming)

279
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:07,576
(Crying)

280
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:10,416
- It's not gonna let us go.
- What?

281
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,252
It's not gonna let us go.
I told you!

282
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,088
I told you, it's not
gonna let us go.

283
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:18,379
Why won't you listen to me?

284
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,548
(Crying)

285
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:27,138
No! No!

286
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:35,775
Man: I know now that my
wife has become host

287
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,565
to a Ca'n Darian demon.

288
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,232
I fear that the only way to stop

289
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,823
those possessed by the
spirits of the book

290
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:45,035
is through the act of
bodily dismemberment.

291
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,824
I would leave now to
avoid this horror,

292
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:48,584
but for myself I...

293
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,745
I have seen the dark shadows
moving in the woods

294
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:56,008
and I have no doubt that whatever I
have resurrected through this book

295
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:59,511
is sure to come calling for me.

296
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:03,675
Okay, let me think. Um...
it's a seven.

297
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,934
- What suit?
- Um, diamonds.

298
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,936
No no no, wait. Um, hearts.

299
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,188
Oh my God! Seven of
hearts, you're right.

300
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,020
Linda: Hey, Ash, I
guessed the card right.

301
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,026
Yeah, truly amazing, Linda.

302
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,716
I don't know, I don't
know, but I think

303
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,801
it's really some sort of
extra sense or something.

304
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,407
- You know, like ESP?
- Okay, try this.

305
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:23,911
- Okay, um, it's a seven.
- I don't believe it!

306
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:28,074
(Stuttering) Of spades...
queen of spades.

307
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:33,207
Cheryl: Four of hearts,

308
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:36,248
eight of spades...

309
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:37,837
(Agitated) two of spades,

310
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:40,218
jack of diamonds, jack of clubs!

311
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,925
- (Roars)
- (Women scream)

312
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:46,342
(Demonic voice) Why have
you disturbed our sleep,

313
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:50,513
awakened us from our
ancient slumber?

314
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:55,435
You will die like the
others before you.

315
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:59,321
One by one we will take you.

316
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:03,234
(Growling)

317
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,493
- (Thuds)
- (Gasps)

318
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,626
What happened to her?

319
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,548
Did you see her eyes?

320
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:28,808
Ash, I'm scared.
What's wrong with her?

321
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,329
(Screaming)

322
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,569
Cheryl, stop it!

323
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,664
(Grunts)

324
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:46,553
Join us. Join...

325
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:53,427
(Cheryl grunting, snarling)

326
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,528
(Panting)

327

(Snarling subsides)

328
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,036
(Cheryl snarling)

329
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,890
(Door opens)

330
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:21,814
Scott: Ash, I think we
ought to get out of here.

331
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:25,148
Yeah.

332
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,232
We still have a few more
hours before morning.

333
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:30,525
Shelly: I don't think
I can wait that long.

334
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:33,945
You have to. We all have to.

335
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:37,160
And then in the morning
we'll get in the car

336
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,040
and we'll take the bridge.

337
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,498
- And...
- (Cheryl continues snarling)

338
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:45,585
Why does she keep making
those horrible noises?

339
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:48,125
Ash: I don't know!

340
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:55,050
What about her eyes?

341
00:39:55,226 --> 00:40:00,221
For God's sake, what
happened to her eyes?

342
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,390
(Growling, laughing
maniacally)

343
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:11,523
(Demon growling)

344
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,361
Everything's gonna be all right.

345
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:38,888
Scotty, I... I think there's
something out there.

346
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:51,526
Go to bed and get
some sleep, okay?

347
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,566
(Demon groaning)

348
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,544
(Groaning intensifies)

(Wood clatters)

352
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,553
Scott: Shelly?

353
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:26,059
CWT-“Tm

355
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:43,739
Cheryl: No!

356
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:46,325
Don't burn her! Get her out!

357
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:49,958
No no no.

358
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,496
(Demonic voice) Thank you.

359
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:57,712
I don't know what
I would have done

360
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:01,799
if I had remained
on those hot coals,

361
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:04,305
burning my pretty flesh.

362
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:07,684
You have pretty skin.

363
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:10,846
- Give it to us!
- (Choking)

364
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:15,066
(Hissing, shouting)

365
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:26,703
Join us. Join us.

366
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:37,664

(Roaring)

379
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,327
Hit her.

380
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,698
Hit her!

381
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:18,913
Hit it!

382
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:27,801

(Squishing)

388
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:13,380
Scott?

389
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:17,425
Yeah?

390
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:21,642
What is... what are we gonna do?

391
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:27,318
We're gonna bury her.

392
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:29,274
You can't bury Shelly.

393
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:30,984
She's a... She's a
friend of ours.

394
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:33,149
Ash, she's dead.

395
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:37,070
Shelly's dead.

396
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,579
We gotta bury her now.

397
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,040
(Squishing)

398
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:47,251

(Demon moaning)

401
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:43,056
Linda's still sleeping.

402
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,350
- I think once her leg's...
- I'm getting out of here.

403
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:48,601
Scott, we can't take Linda
anywhere with her leg like that.

404
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:51,497
We don't even know if there is any
other way back besides the bridge.

405
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:54,192
Well, maybe there's a
hiking trail or an old road

406
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:56,858
or some other way
around the cliff.

407
00:49:57,036 --> 00:50:00,154
I mean, there's gotta be another
way besides the bridge.

408
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:01,913
Listen to me.

409
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,868
Linda cannot walk with
her leg like that.

410
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:06,205
She can't even stand up.

411
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:09,416
Well, then we'll leave her here
until we can send somebody back.

412
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:10,751
What are you, crazy?

413
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:14,043
- Scott...
- Look, I'm gettin' out.

414
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,211
I don't care what
happens to her.

415
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,720
She's your girlfriend.
You take care of her.

416
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:20,677
I'm getting the hell
out of here right now.

417
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:44,789
Cheryl: Soon all of
you will be like me

418
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:47,496
and then we will lock
you up in the cellar.

419
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:49,911
(Cackling)

420

(Cackling)

421
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:43,010
- Ahh!
- Ash!

422
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:46,141
- Oh my God.
- Help me.

423
00:51:47,146 --> 00:51:50,730
Yes yes.

424
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:53,482
(Giggling)

425
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,313
Ash.

426
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:57,979
(Groaning)

427
00:51:58,157 --> 00:52:00,990
Scotty, you're gonna be okay.

428
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,698
You're gonna be just
fine, you'll see.

429
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:07,864
- (Metal clangs)
- (Shelly cackling)

430
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:17,708
Ash, it's not gonna
let us leave.

431
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:23,005
Cheryl... Cheryl was right.

432
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:26,095
- We're all gonna die here.
- No, we're not gonna die.

433
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:29,602
"We're all gonna die, a" of us!

434
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:31,934
No, we're not gonna die.

435
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:34,690
We're not gonna die! We're
gonna get outta here.

436
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,771
Now listen to me, Scotty.

437
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:39,653
Is there a way
around the bridge?

438
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,154
- Scotty!
- (Groaning)

439
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:43,191
Listen to me, please.
For God's sake!

440
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:45,451
- Scott!
- (Grunts)

441
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:48,739
- Come on.
- Ash...

442
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:51,783
Ash, I don't wanna die.

443
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,792
You're not gonna leave
me, are you, Ash?

444
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:56,545
- An you?
- (Mocking) "I don't wanna die."

445
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,501
"You're not gonna leave
me here, are you?"

446
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:01,668
"Are you, Ash?" (Laughing)

447
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:06,388
Scotty, now come on! Listen
to me, for God's sake.

448
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:09,346
Is there a way
around the bridge?

449
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:13,479
There's a way... the trail.

450
00:53:13,649 --> 00:53:16,186
But the trees, Ash,

451
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:19,022
they know.

452
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,733
Don't you see, Ash?
They're alive.

453
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:25,070
- (Women giggling)
- Ahhh!

454

(Laughing)

455
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:36,668
Ash: Shut up. Shut up, Linda!

(Continues laughing)

459
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:01,611
Kill her. Kill her.

460
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:05,148
Kill her if you can, lover boy.

461
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,949
God forgive me, Linda.

462
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:17,118
(Continues laughing)

463
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,442
Oh, Ash... help me, please.

Help me, please, Ash.

467
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:56,457
Oh, Ash, please don't let
them take me away again.

468
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:58,288
- Please.
- No, I won't.

469
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:01,124
- Please.
- I won't, I promise.

470

(Cheryl in normal voice) Ashley.
Ashley, help me.

471

I'm all right.

476

Oh, you bastards.

485
