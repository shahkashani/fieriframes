Come on, girls.

179
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,806
Tommy, help me
get the baby

180
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,211
and the rest of the girl
crap out of the truck.

181
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,441
Do you mind?
Thank you.

182
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,601
All right.

183
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,001
Let's make
some memories, huh?

184
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,044
Thank you, honey.
Thank you. Oh, my goodness.

185
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,248
A holiday roast
is a surprise.

186
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,731
Hemorrhoids are a surprise.

187
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,565
She is a goddamn nightmare.
What were you thinking?

188
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,848
Come on, she's not that bad.
Oh.

189
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,081
She's not!

190
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,844
Besides, she
tricked me, okay?

191
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,490
I thought we were
just dropping off gifts,

192
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,160
and she came to the door
with a suitcase.

193
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,811
What was I supposed to do?
Tell her she has to spend Christmas by herself?

194
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,848
No, but at least you
could have warned me

195
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,571
when one of your mistakes
is gonna become my problem.

196
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,529
You think everything I do
is a mistake.

197
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,050
Sorry.
Look out. Look out.

198
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,321
Hey, honey.
Ooh. Oh.

199
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,004
I think this
warhead's armed.

200
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,849
Wow, you're so stinky.
(LAUGHS)

201
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,729
Okay, I'm gonna
go change her.

202
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,801
Let's go this way.

203
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,201
Just set that up wherever
you want, T. (SIGHS)

smells like shit.

205
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,405

That's my boy!

210
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,090
It sure is.

211
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,128
I'm getting Howie Junior
into game shape.

212
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,651
By the time he gets
to high school,

213
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,724
he's gonna be the biggest
lineman in the state.

214
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,283
Did you ever spend any time
on the field, Tommy?

215
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,647
No, actually,
I didn't have time in my younger years.

216
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,131
I was in training mostly.

217
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,800
What were you
training for? Uh...

218
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,884
Army? Marines?

219
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,726
It was the Eagle Scouts.

220
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,486
Eagle Scouts.

221
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,048
Now, Eagle Scouts, kids,

222
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,924
that's where you weave baskets

223
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,445
and help little old ladies
across the street. (LAUGHING)

224
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,244
Am I right?
No, no.

225
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,525
(CHUCKLES) No, no, no. It was actually
quite a bit of survival training.

226
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,481
So...

227
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,530
Well, the only survival training
I need is my ol' smoke pole,

228
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,769
and a big, fat
box of buckshot

229
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,569
that I keep out
in that truck.

A shepherd has got
to protect his flock.

231
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,282
Honey, we said no gun talk
at the dinner table.

232
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,244
This family needs
a little gun talk,

233

or anywhere else.

your Aunt Sarah likes

everything to be
clean and perfect,

240
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,206
and that's why she makes so
much food that you can't pronounce.

241
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,644
Well, I just thought
you guys might like a break

242
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,609
from macaroni and cheese
with hot dogs.

243
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,761
Yeah, okay.

a ham at Christmas?

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,043
Maybe it's time
for dessert, hmm?

00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,365
It's delicious, honey.

249
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,680

You can just say
something nice.

I'll say it
when she gets back, if dessert's good.

Well, if you could
just do me a favor.

- Just say something nice about dessert.

Hear what happened to Santa?

259

(SIGHS) No, Stevie.
What happened to Santa?

260
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,290
Heard it on the news.

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,362

Shattered both his legs.

Frostbite took care of his pain,
but not his hunger.

264
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,242
So, to survive,
he had to slaughter and eat his reindeer.

go to your trailer

out of my kitchen.

are actually

01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:01,571
I just wanted Christmas
to be like it used to be.

1434
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:04,249
That's what

1435
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:06,169
Nothing bad's
gonna happen on Christmas, right?

1436
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:09,608
I just got my ass kicked
by a bunch of Christmas cookies,

And as he had for
thousands of years,

1443
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:27,764
Krampus came not to reward,
but to punish.

1444
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:33,364
Not to give, but to take.
