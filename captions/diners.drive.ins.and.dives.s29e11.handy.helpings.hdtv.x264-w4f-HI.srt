00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:02,267
         Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:03,535
I'm Guy Fieri, and we're rolling
         out looking for

3
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:07,039
   America's greatest diners,
      drive-ins, and dives.

4
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:09,441
          This trip...
Come on, look at that!

5
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:11,043
    No knife and fork today.

6
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:12,244
                 You eat it
              the way you like.

7
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:13,946
     [ Laughs ]

8
00:00:13,948 --> 00:00:16,949
 'Cause we're literally grabbing
       some gangster grub.

9
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:19,551
  That's raindrops
in Flavortown, folks.

10
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:21,420
  Like legit tacos in Atlanta.

11
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:23,155
  You'll love this.

12
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:25,557
     And prime-time burgers
          in Salt Lake.

13
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,459
    Oh, my gosh!

14
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,628
    Plus, we're getting crazy
       with the kolaches.

15
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,130
   Three, two, go.

16
00:00:31,132 --> 00:00:32,498
     And feeling the need...

17
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,433
 What in the world?!

18
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:35,768
          ...for speed.

19
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,269
  You're an animal.

20
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:38,871
     That's all right here,
           right now,

21
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:41,340
 on "Diners, Drive-ins & Dives."

22
00:00:41,342 --> 00:00:48,447
                     ♪♪

23
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:53,685
                     ♪♪

24
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:56,522
   So "Triple D" is all about
      finding the funky mom

25
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:58,590
         and pop joints
     all around the country.

26
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:00,793
   Well, now I guess it's kind
  of like all around the world.

27
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:02,628
 So I'm here in Salt Lake City,
              Utah,

28
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,531
 where three buddies are living
     the all-American dream.

29
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:07,066
    You see, they're sitting
         around saying,

30
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:09,368
       "Hey, one day, man,
    let's open up a brewery."

31
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,870
  "Yeah, and right next to it,
 we'll open up a burger joint."

32
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:13,439
     Well, these three made
           it happen.

33
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:15,641
 This is Proper Burger Company.

34
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:20,179
    I'm gonna start dropping
          more burgers.

35
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:21,380
        Food's fantastic.

36
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:23,515
     I mean, they have such
      a variety of burgers.

37
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:25,084
   Vegan Bollywood, order up!

38
00:01:25,086 --> 00:01:26,919
    And the beer is amazing.

39
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:28,387
   FIERI: I got a melting pot
         of people here,

40
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:29,988
         everybody likes
        burgers and beer.

41
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,958
   Which is why brothers Liam
   and Rio Connelly and buddy

42
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,229
Andrew Tendick doubled down with
 their side-by-side businesses.

43
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:38,497
               You make beer.

44
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:39,531
    You sell the beer over there
                 in the bar.

45
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:40,866
    Then you also take the beer,

46
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:42,034
       ad you bring it over here
           to the burger company

47
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:43,235
                 and use it
            in the recipes here.

48
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:44,536
              Yep.

49
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,638
  FIERI: And their burger boss
    is Chef Jeff Springer...

50
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,640
    Swinging two pork cities.

51
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:49,975
   FIERI: ...who's definitely
          not sticking

52
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:51,710
    to the same old same old.

53
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:53,412
    Double rarebit order up!

54
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:57,483
   The rarebit has house-made
  beer-cheese -- super unique.

55
00:01:57,485 --> 00:01:58,784
Chef, what are we making.

56
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:00,252
             Today, we're making
             our rarebit sauce.

57
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:01,687
And what do you know
about rarebit sauce?

58
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:03,355
       It's a beer-cheese sauce.

59
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:05,157
           They believe it comes
               from the Welsh.

60
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,892
 He had me at hello
   with that one.

61
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:09,528
   We're gonna heat up our milk,
 and then this is our amber ale.

62
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,796
       Got it.

63
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:11,964
  Then we're gonna bring this up
                 to simmer.

64
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:13,198
  Simmer down now.

65
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,466
               Now we're going
              to make the roux.

66
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,934
             Bacon fat, butter.

67
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,670
This is a bikini-weather sauce
if I've ever seen it.

68
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:20,739
              Sweat some onion.
             All-purpose flour.

69
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:23,008
       The Worcestershire sauce.

70
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,210
Worcestershire sauce.
           Worcestershire sauce.

71
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:26,378
             White wine vinegar.

72
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,046
Hurry up before I eat
   all the cheese.

73
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:29,948
                    Salt.
            Whole-grain mustard.

74
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,216
                   Thyme.

75
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:32,551
             Now we're gonna add
              our melted beer.

76
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:35,354
This is the European version
  of nacho cheese.

77
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:37,422
         I'm gonna transfer this
              into a 22-quart.

78
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:39,725
           Add our Irish cheddar
             and the gorgonzola.

79
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:41,460
We're gonna put this burger
    together now?

80
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:42,961
                    Yep.
              Two patties down.

81
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:44,163
    Two patties?

82
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:47,399
  Never frozen, locally sourced,
                 grass-fed.

83
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:48,901
            Just kind of warm up
                 the bacon.

84
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:49,968
 That fry is legit.

85
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,703
       The house-cut double fry.

86
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:52,938
       Yes.
                  Oh.

87
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,439
  Imagine that with some rarebit
                 on it, too.

88
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,041
  I don't even have
   to imagine it.

89
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:57,609
                 [ Laughs ]

90
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:00,946
That rarebit sauce is everything
I love in a cheese sauce.

91
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:02,281
 It's got the tang.

92
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:05,384
You get the underlying notes
   of the mustard.

93
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:06,852
  Oh, that's good!

94
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,620
    We've got a really good sear
             on the burger now.

95
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,222
 Look at that crust.
      Gorgeous.

96
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:12,090
       I'm gonna stack these two
                   on top,

97
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:14,293
   and we're gonna add the bacon
           right on top of this.

98
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:15,494
        Okay.

99
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:17,429
            Whole-grain mustard,
              sliced tomatoes,

100
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:20,566
        red onion, rarebit sauce
             right over the top.

101
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:22,301
       And that's all she wrote.

102
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:26,738
     Delicious.

103
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,307
I just want to taste
 the meat by itself.

104
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:30,075
It's seared super-hot
     so you get

105
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:32,177
this really nice caramelization
   on both sides.

106
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:34,346
 And then it's still
  tender and pink.

107
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:36,915
        Mmm!
The rarebit sauce is money.

108
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:39,918
All day long, money.

109
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,287
   I want a gallon
for the rarebit to go.

110
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:43,522
 Dynamite job, Chef.

111
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:45,591
     Got the rarebit burger.
      Really hits the spot.

112
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:46,892
Everything you want in a burger.

113
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,360
         All the flavors
    go really well together.

114
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:50,095
If I could just drink the sauce,
            I would.

115
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:51,997
          But I can't,
    so I drink the beer, too.

116
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:53,298
 How did these guys
 do with their beer?

117
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,200
      Some of the best beer
          in the state.

118
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:57,869
  The styles that they do here
 is something totally different.

119
00:03:57,871 --> 00:04:01,173
 They do a gose, that's a salted
   beer, which is pretty fun.

120
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:03,775
      Their experimentation
 with the beer is also reflected

121
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:06,211
    in their experimentation
 in the burgers that they make.

122
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:07,613
Hipster burger, order up!

123
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:10,349
      I mean, you don't get
   a Pork City just anywhere.

124
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:11,950
   Here we have the Pork City.

125
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:14,152
 MAN: They've got house-made ham
        and bacon on it,

126
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:15,487
     and what's not to like?

127
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:17,489
What are we gonna do now?
          The brine for the ham.

128
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:18,824
                   First,
         we do some brown sugar.

129
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:20,292
                    Salt.
                Curing salt.

130
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:22,561
             Cumin, fennel seed,
              juniper berries.

131
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:24,296
Nice.
        And some cinnamon stick.

132
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:25,430
             The water goes in.

133
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,798
How long is the brine
    gonna simmer?

134
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,333
                Five minutes.

135
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:30,335
Now the ice is to cool it down
so we don't poach the ham

136
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:31,637
when it goes in the brine.
       Got it.

137

     look easy.

    Let's hit it.

272
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,847
So we are making the sausage for
  our sausage and gravy kolache.

273
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:10,916
      Okay.

276
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:15,587
                   And then...
Fresh-cut sage.

277
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:18,156
                    Yeah.
 And this is just pork and beef.

278
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:19,658
          Little water in there.

279
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,192
Start cooking that down,
and then we're gonna make

280
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:23,361
the gravy right in with
the sausage right now as we go?

281
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:24,596
                    Yeah.

282
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:26,398
Salt, pepper, flour,
a little bit of milk.

283
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,799
                      Yep.
   Let that cool.

284
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:29,100
And then stuff it.

285
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:30,769
     So you just take your dough
                 and fill it

286
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,170
              with the sausage
             and gravy filling.

287
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:33,939
Whoa, that's a good portion.
                       Pinch it.

How long are they gonna bake?

 that you eat them?

299
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:58,730
It's light, it's airy,
but it's hearty enough

 that it really does
give you enough texture.

301

The gravy with the sausage,
it's tender, it's moist.

302
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:05,737
There's a lot of depth
