00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:55,410
           So now we're gonna do
              some gumbo, rice.

272
00:09:55,412 --> 00:09:57,946
              Finishing it with
              Cajun seasoning.

273
00:09:57,948 --> 00:09:59,648
    That's good.

274

                 Talk to me.

275
00:10:01,251 --> 00:10:03,151
 Don't even act like
I need to talk to you

276
00:10:03,153 --> 00:10:04,886
  because you know
  how good this is.

277
00:10:04,888 --> 00:10:09,324
That is every bit of what
you want a gumbo to taste like.

278
00:10:09,326 --> 00:10:11,926
All that big grits flavor
coming out of that seafood.

279
00:10:11,928 --> 00:10:13,595
     It's silky.
    It's tender.

280
00:10:13,597 --> 00:10:15,063
  I can't eat this
    fast enough.

281
00:10:15,065 --> 00:10:17,065
                 Thank you.

282
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:18,566
             Here's your gumbo.

283
00:10:18,568 --> 00:10:21,436
       I like the flavor.
  All her special ingredients.

284
00:10:21,438 --> 00:10:23,371
    The seasoning, the gravy.

285
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,741
               Oh, cornbread.
  It has that just sweet flavor.

286
00:10:26,743 --> 00:10:29,344
         Wonderful to crumble up
                in my gumbo.

287
00:10:29,346 --> 00:10:31,846
      She feeds
the body and the soul.

288
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:33,948
             WOMAN:
She gives people second chances.

289
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,351
  When it's hard for them to go
    get a job somewhere else.

290
00:10:36,353 --> 00:10:38,787
         She trains 'em,
     and a lot of 'em go off

291
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:40,522
 and get their culinary degree.

292
00:10:40,524 --> 00:10:42,691
          I do hearing impaired.

293
00:10:42,693 --> 00:10:46,127
      I do anybody that has made
                 a mistake,

294
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:47,962
                and they feel
              there's no more.

295
00:10:47,964 --> 00:10:51,533
I was taught, if you don't work,
               you don't eat.

296
00:10:51,535 --> 00:10:55,503
     So my theory is to help you
            to readjust to life.

297
00:10:55,505 --> 00:10:57,005
It's a great mantra.

298
00:10:57,007 --> 00:11:00,308
      Love from Ma's heart
  finds its way into the food.

299
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,577
                 Pork chop,
             red bean and rice.

300
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:06,614
    Fried pork chops. They're
tender, crispy, very delightful.

301
00:11:06,616 --> 00:11:09,050
     The red beans and rice,
    can't go wrong with that.

302
00:11:09,052 --> 00:11:10,819
   Now we're into
the famous pork chop.

303
00:11:10,821 --> 00:11:14,356
      You start with your flour,
          a little black pepper.

304
00:11:14,358 --> 00:11:15,824
               <i> Poquito</i> salt.

            -Powder.

307
00:11:19,696 --> 00:11:21,596
          Paprika to give color.

308
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,531
             Garlic.
       -Creole seasoning.

309
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:25,066
  Give it a whisk.

310
00:11:25,068 --> 00:11:27,369
We got pork shoulder.
Tenderize it a little bit.

311
00:11:27,371 --> 00:11:28,403
             -Yeah.
           -I gotcha.

312
00:11:28,405 --> 00:11:29,571
                Flour, water.

313
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:31,072
   And then flour
   one more time?

314
00:11:31,074 --> 00:11:32,640
            I use my fryer, 300.

     17 minutes.

     Really giving it a gracious
              helping of this.

406
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,491
  Because what's going to happen
      is you'd take the knuckle,

407
00:14:36,493 --> 00:14:39,093
   and you'd cut these ends off,
        and then you'd go again.

408
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:40,828
        Well, it would look like
             these burnt pieces

409
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,231
        'cause you reseasoned it
              and resmoked it.
   Yep.

410
00:14:43,233 --> 00:14:45,667
      But you want to talk about
        the pièce de résistance.

411
00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:48,369
         So for you to be making
   a whole sandwich out of this,

412
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:49,504
      that's a give right there.

413
00:14:49,506 --> 00:14:50,939
              What kind of wood
              we smoking with?

414
00:14:50,941 --> 00:14:52,740
   Hickory chips.

415
00:14:52,742 --> 00:14:53,942
               Brisket's down.
               What's up next?

416
00:14:53,944 --> 00:14:55,443
 We're going to make
 our barbecue sauce.

417
00:14:55,445 --> 00:14:57,845
Ketchup, brown sugar,
      molasses.

418
00:14:57,847 --> 00:14:59,213
              Pineapple juice.

419
00:14:59,215 --> 00:15:01,182
 A little sweetness,
a little bit of tang, as well.

420
00:15:01,184 --> 00:15:02,917
       Water.
    Liquid Smoke.

421
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:04,485
      I got a waft of it as soon
               as I moved it.

422
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:05,887
     -Yeah, you smell that?
          -Dry mustard?

423
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:07,488
      Yes, sir.
 Granulated garlic.

424
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,023
     Cajun spice
  and kosher salt.

425
00:15:09,025 --> 00:15:12,894
   All right, so let this simmer
          down, simmer down now.

426
00:15:12,896 --> 00:15:15,430
Yes, sir. Now we're going to
season and sauce it.

427
00:15:15,432 --> 00:15:18,566
    Cajun spice,
a light brown sugar, our sauce.

428
00:15:18,568 --> 00:15:20,335
       And now mix it all?
           Absolutely.

429
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:22,270
 This is going to go
into the smoker on 250

430
00:15:22,272 --> 00:15:23,972
  for about an hour
and a half to two hours.

431
00:15:23,974 --> 00:15:25,573
      -And then it's done?
    -And then it's finished.

432
00:15:25,575 --> 00:15:28,109
         Just waiting on the mac
       and cheese. Let's see it.

433
00:15:28,111 --> 00:15:30,311
  Unsalted butter,
all-purpose flour, cold milk.

434
00:15:30,313 --> 00:15:31,713
       So make a basic Béchamel.

435
00:15:31,715 --> 00:15:33,448
I'm just going to add some
sharp cheddar cheese,

436
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:36,818
kosher salt, black pepper,
and our Cajun spice.

437
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,653
       Add the parboiled elbows.

438
00:15:38,655 --> 00:15:40,622
          -Absolutely.
     -Let's put it together.

439
00:15:40,624 --> 00:15:42,957
   -We got our mac and cheese.
  -Where's the bun coming from?

440
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,027
A local baker here in town.
Smoked brisket burnt ends.

441
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,295
    Sliced pear.

442
00:15:47,297 --> 00:15:48,997
       Everything's making sense
           except the pear, bud.

443
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:50,798
    I'm following your lead.
        -You'll like it.

444
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,067
Sharp cheddar cheese,
a little more barbecue sauce.

445
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:54,502
  Take a little bit
   of the top out.

446
00:15:54,504 --> 00:15:56,270
      Wow, you're really helping
       on the carbs, aren't you?

447
00:15:56,272 --> 00:15:58,206
That's so it's a little
health-more conscious.

448
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,340
          Health more?

449
00:15:59,342 --> 00:16:00,675
    A little more
  health conscious.

450
00:16:00,677 --> 00:16:02,010
          Health more conscious.

451
00:16:02,012 --> 00:16:03,978
         Come on down where it's
     health more conscious here.

452
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,446
And then on the press.

453
00:16:05,448 --> 00:16:08,116
  That's what I'm talking about.
        Bread on mac and cheese.

454
00:16:08,118 --> 00:16:09,550
     With fruit.

455
00:16:12,522 --> 00:16:13,588
 Does the pear play?

456
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,556
        Don't talk in the middle
               of a backswing.

457
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,025
                Remember when
               you were a kid,

458
00:16:17,027 --> 00:16:18,760
               and you'd wait
           for that report card?

459
00:16:18,762 --> 00:16:21,462
        Yeah.
I'm waiting right now.

460
00:16:21,464 --> 00:16:23,965
    -How does that feel now?
   -It's pretty nerve-racking.

461
00:16:23,967 --> 00:16:25,333
                I'm going to
             tell you something.

462
00:16:25,335 --> 00:16:28,703
               I'm going to be
                100% honest.

463
00:16:28,705 --> 00:16:30,038
              That's fantastic.

464
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,240
        -Thank you, Chef.
  -This is full of high notes.

465
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,609
              It's studded with
              these big pieces

466
00:16:34,611 --> 00:16:37,445
           of this super tender,
           but textural brisket.

467
00:16:37,447 --> 00:16:39,013
                Then you get
             the creamy cheese.

468
00:16:39,015 --> 00:16:41,315
    Then you get the little soft
             bit of the noodle.

469
00:16:41,317 --> 00:16:43,551
       The pear does give a nice
             little refreshing.

470
00:16:43,553 --> 00:16:46,854
        -A little crunch?
        -A little crunch,

471
00:16:46,856 --> 00:16:48,489
               a little sugar.

472
00:16:48,491 --> 00:16:50,224
                  It gives
            a little raw relief.

473
00:16:50,226 --> 00:16:52,126
        This is a lethal weapon.

474
00:16:52,128 --> 00:16:54,295
     You'd have to register this
               in Flavortown.

475
00:16:54,297 --> 00:16:55,830
We'll get its ID card,
    don't worry.

476
00:16:55,832 --> 00:16:57,632
       -Really impressive.
      -Thank you, brother.

477
00:16:57,634 --> 00:16:58,700
      Got a Burnt End Melt.

478
00:16:58,702 --> 00:17:00,168
MAN: The Burnt End Melt
  is really great.

479
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,269
       I mean,
it does have burnt ends.

480
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:03,304
They're very caramelized,
juicy on the inside.

481
00:17:03,306 --> 00:17:05,339
      -The pear seems odd.
       -It does seem odd.

482
00:17:05,341 --> 00:17:08,042
   -Yeah, but it's like candy.
       -Tastes delicious.

483
00:17:08,044 --> 00:17:09,877
        -Great sandwich.
       -Side of corn bake.

484
00:17:09,879 --> 00:17:11,946
 The food's spot on, lights out.

485
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,282
   Hard name to say, but it's
    an easy place to eat at.

486
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:15,583
              How did the name
                 come about?

487
00:17:15,585 --> 00:17:17,151
  Dignowity Hill is
the neighborhood we're in.

488
00:17:17,153 --> 00:17:18,586
It's during the Texas
     Revolution.

489
00:17:18,588 --> 00:17:20,354
Santa Ana had his troops
  here on the hill

490
00:17:20,356 --> 00:17:22,590
because he could see
all the way down to the Alamo.

491
00:17:22,592 --> 00:17:25,059
                   Got it.
  I'm so much more educated now.

492
00:17:25,061 --> 00:17:27,795
              MAN:
 It's really convenient because
  it's very close to downtown,

493
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,330
   but it's not in the center
          of everything

494
00:17:29,332 --> 00:17:30,765
        where it's going
      to be super crowded.

495
00:17:30,767 --> 00:17:32,400
             I got to walk away
               from this one.

496
00:17:32,402 --> 00:17:34,802
  When we come back, we're going
       to do a real-deal Reuben.

497
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,137
           Reuben with
         a side of corn.

498
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:39,373
       The Reuben's great.
   The pastrami is delicious.

499
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,676
   I've never had another one
     like it in San Antonio.

500
00:17:43,246 --> 00:17:47,348
                     ♪♪

501
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,051
 Welcome back. We're on the East
     Side of San Antonio, Texas,

502
00:17:50,053 --> 00:17:52,386
          hanging out at a funky
  little joint called Dignowity.

503
00:17:52,388 --> 00:17:54,055
             That's the mountain
              we're on, right?

504
00:17:54,057 --> 00:17:55,356
           The knoll?
        -Dignowity Hill.

505
00:17:55,358 --> 00:17:57,191
   -So you can see the Alamo.
     -You can see the Alamo.

506
00:17:57,193 --> 00:17:59,861
  I'm learning all about history
 and making some great barbecue.

507
00:17:59,863 --> 00:18:03,364
             FIERI:
  And it's all happening inside
   a funky former burger joint

508
00:18:03,366 --> 00:18:05,666
        where Chef Andrew
    is combining his passion

509
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,702
         for sandwiches
        and smoked meats.

510
00:18:07,704 --> 00:18:09,003
Two Reubens coming out.

511
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,272
     MAN: The Reuben itself
      has pastrami, cheese,

512
00:18:11,274 --> 00:18:13,508
         and it's a very
         unique flavor.

513
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,644
  Sauerkraut, a nice, toasted,
          perfect bun.

514
00:18:16,646 --> 00:18:17,712
              What do you got?

515
00:18:17,714 --> 00:18:19,413
So the pastrami's a little
more traditional.

516
00:18:19,415 --> 00:18:20,782
        Same cut of beef.
       -So prime brisket.

517
00:18:20,784 --> 00:18:22,784
 We're going to make
a real basic brine for it.

518
00:18:22,786 --> 00:18:25,353
Put water, brown sugar,
coriander seed, kosher salt.

519
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,155
                There you go.
                There you go.

520
00:18:27,157 --> 00:18:28,222
Yellow mustard seed.

521
00:18:28,224 --> 00:18:29,857
          -Interesting.
        -Pickling spice.

522
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,592
          Curing salt.
          -You got it.

523
00:18:31,594 --> 00:18:33,528
 Bring it to a boil
so everything dissolves.

524
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,163
The flavors kind of wake up
    a little bit.

525
00:18:35,165 --> 00:18:37,165
Get it cool and pour
it over the brisket.

526
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:38,533
              How long is this
               going to brine?

527
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:40,601
  Over the weekend,
normally three or four days.

528
00:18:40,603 --> 00:18:42,670
           All right, how long's
                your weekend?

529
00:18:42,672 --> 00:18:44,405
              So a little rinse
           has happened to this,

530
00:18:44,407 --> 00:18:46,574
         but you can see some of
 the pickling spice still there.

531
00:18:46,576 --> 00:18:48,042
 Now we're going to
     season it.

532
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,344
Whole black peppercorn,
coriander seed, white sugar,
